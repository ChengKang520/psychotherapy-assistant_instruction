00:00:00
 Welcome, ah, all of you. We thank you very much for being here, Sunday morning, in case you haven't noticed. Now, let me introduce to you Dr. Herbert Exum, Chair of the Psychological Social Foundation Department of USF and he will introduce the presentation for today(ph). 

00:00:25
Dr. Herbert Exum 

00:00:25
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Again, yeah, my name is Herbert Exum, and, ah, this is, ah, Ms. Amy Menna- 

00:00:35
Preparing for the Return of Clients With war Zone Induced Traumas Herbert A. Exum, Ph.D. Amy Menna, M.A. Carlos Zalaquett, Ph.D. Department of Psychological and Social Foundations University of South Florida 

00:00:35
DR. HERBERT EXUM - who's actually my doctoral student, and my colleague, Mr. Carlos Zalaquett. Uhm, what we'll be talking about today will be, uhm, essentially the kinds of issues that you should be prepared for as veterans returned back from service and, uhm, I'll talk for the first part of the presentation, then Ms. Menna will finish the presentation. 

00:00:55
During the next several months, hundreds of veterans will return from deployment. They will all return changed to some degree, and unfortunately, all of them will not be able to smoothly readjust to civilian life. Many will seek help but not know where to find it. Others will silently suffer coping as they can. Some will find you but still be unable to explain what is wrong. You must be prepared to help them. Although you cannot give them back what they have lost, you can help them learn to live successfully with what they have. 

00:00:55
DR. HERBERT EXUM The statement of the problem really is that in the next few months, ah, more and more veterans will return and some of them will do very well when they return. They'll be able to pick up their lives and, and move forward pretty easily. Ah, unfortunately, all of them won't be able to do it, and some of them won't know why they can't do it and some of them won't be able to find the help that they need to do it. Ah, But many of them will find their way to you. And so, one of things I want to do is to help you be prepared to, to offer our service members, uhm, the best type of, ah, service that, ah, we can. Ah, one of the things I'd like for you to know, uhm, about me is, first of all, I'm a civilian. Uhm, I have no military service, I'm Vietnam era but not Vietnam- 

00:01:45
Perspective Point of view of the Presenter 

00:01:45
DR. HERBERT EXUM  -Veteran. Ah, I have, ah, most of my work, most of what I know about veteran's issues comes from my work as a clinical researcher, that is I worked in a vet center on site with veterans for about five years and, uhm, many of the things that I'm gonna' talk with you about are things that I learned from the veterans themselves and also from their, uhm, my research with them. Uhm, most of how I learned what I learned was by being a participant observer, that is, I actually was a clinician while being a researcher as well. I ran groups, I didn't do individual work. Uhm, I ran three, ah, therapy groups each week, ah, and so that's how I got to know what I did know about them. I also had, uhm, a yearly exposure of therapy intervention when we took a bus load of veterans to, uhm, Washington D.C, uhm, to really, uhm, experience the war, uhm, because for Vietnam veterans, that's a very important issue and a very important milestone in their own treatment. Uhm, I also was able to take, uhm, two veterans and ah, two of the therapists, uhm, on a, really a fact-finding mission, uhm, who went back to Vietnam because oftentimes, ah, there is this lure among vet center employees that if somehow we could take everybody back to Vietnam, that, that will be the best type of treatment for Vietnam era veterans. Well, one of the things uhm, can't do because it just costs too much to do, uhm, but what I did find out is that the videotape that I took of my experiences in Vietnam really had a great impact on people, on the veterans back at the center. Uhm, 'coz for one thing, it let them know that the Vietnam they remembered, no longer existed. Ah, because they saw once and for all it was just a nice Asian country and nothing was on fire, people weren't being blown up and that it had a tremendous impact that, ah, I hadn't even thought ah, would be that great. So, in a nutshell, uhm, that's it about me, no, except for the part that I am a veteran's advocate. Uhm, so the things that I say, uhm, if they sound anti-war, they probably are anti-war, but I really am, ah, pro-veteran. And it's hard for military people to, to understand that because they typically say that, ah, if you're anti-war, then you, you're anti-soldier. Uhm, But I'm, uhm, definitely pro-veteran and I wanna make sure that civilians learn as much as they can about how to be effective with veterans. So, that's what I'm gonna' start with-

Program Outline Veterans Issues Self-Assessment Defining the Military Military culture and the Mission of the Military Military Counseling and mental Health Services Interacting with Military Personnel and Their Families. 

00:04:30
DR. HERBERT EXUM - uhm, talking about what the military is now and, ah, then move on to talk about military culture, ah, because I do believe that the experience and training veterans have actually does change them in a way that's so different that when they come back to civilian life, they really come back to another culture. So part of what's happening is really cultural readjustment. So, let me go on to, ah, just talk about military a little bit. Uhm, as you probably know, the military is comprised of the, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, uhm, but most people forget about the Coast Guard, because the Coast Guard is actually also a part of the Armed Services. Uhm, the Armed Services also involves the National Guard and Reserves, and unlike other wars, this particular war has a lot more, or higher percentage of the service(ph) and National Guard members there actually fighting(ph), and typically doesn't, typically haven't had this percentage since maybe World War II. Uhm, what that means is that you're much more likely to see people then in your own communities who experienced service and will have known you and more have to talk to you than people who are career military. Ah, but you can see people everywhere. Ah, right now, who can serve in the military? Well, anybody who's, right now, 18 years old and older, 35 used to be the limit. I think it's creeped up a little bit now. I think it's 40. Ah, next week it may be 42, so you never know for sure, but it, it's gonna' keep moving up because it's hard to get people in. Uhm, you still do need to have a high school diploma. If you have a GED, you're gonna' need to have college work. Who have(ph) heard of some college work beyond the GED? Uhm, typically you can, need know, not to have a criminal record. I think that rule is becoming more relaxed as it was in the Vietnam era and in, in a relatively good health. You do not have to be an American citizen, uhm, to be a member of the military, and that was one of the things I did not know when I started working with the veterans. Uhm, one of the myths is that if you are, uhm, if you have a green card that upon completing your military service, you can automatically become citizen. Ah, it's not actually true. Uhm, and often, people get called(ph) at when recruiting, ah, uhm, but it's, it's not the law. Also, if you join the milit, also if you were gay or say you were gay, lesbian, or bisexual, you are still barred from military service. The "don't ask, don't tell" rule has no weight of law, so it's still illegal to be gay, homosexual or bisexual or to make a reference to those terms in the military. Uhm, so you still can't be, can't become a service member. 

00:07:30
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Now, why do most people join the, the military? People still join out of patriotism. Ah, people join the military because it's a family tradition. Uhm, people still join the military, uhm, to seek, uhm, uhm, adventure, to have an opportunity to travel. Uhm, and some seek, ah, financial resources from the military so that they can, ah, have a college education and so forth afterwards. Uhm, and that's true for men and women. And right now there are about 15 percent of the military really still is women. Uhm, that has been about the same for the last, since the first Gulf War, uhm, slightly more women are officers now that they used to be, uhm, and still not all combat, ah, not all military specialty ah, occupational specialties are opened to women. Most are, but women cannot still serve in the artillery. They still can't serve in Special Forces, uhm, ah, and, uhm, but it's not true that women are armed anymore(ph), and, ah, something that you would think is fairly safe or is fairly benign have involved, jobs like driving a truck really isn't in the current rule, and women are heavily armed as does the men are. Uhm, and for that reason, women are just as likely nowadays to have combat injuries including (inaudible ) wounds as are men. 

00:09:00
[sil.] 

00:09:00
DR. HERBERT EXUM  There are probably about 25 million veterans altogether right now still living. The largest cohorts still are the Vietnam Era vets. Uhm, uhm, there are probably about 5 million World War II vets but that keeps declining that as time goes on. There are no more living vets from the Civil War or the Spanish-American War. 

00:09:25
Military Culture and Mission 

00:09:25
DR. HERBERT EXUM Uhm, so, let me move on to military fellowship. Again, ah, what I said about the military being a separate culture means that all of the kinds or characteristics you associate with a culture are really in the military. Uhm, people there have a distinctive way of dressing. They have a distinctive language. They have a distinctively way of referring to time. Uhm, they have this, ah, distinct, they have distinct traditions, ah, codes, status, all of those things. And all of those things, uhm, and combined with military values, virtues and precepts creates really, uhm, a military culture. Uhm, the whole purpose of boot camp is to have people transform from civilian life into the military life. So it's a stripping away of the civilian self and then really and in building of the military self. Uhm, and one of the most important values that is instilled during boot camp is the importance of the group and the importance of the mission, and those two factors, ah, unit cohesion and mission, or dedication to the mission, really have a tremendous impact on soldiers' morale and actually, their adjustment when they come back to the States. 

00:10:55
DR. HERBERT EXUM Okay. So, lets talk about, uhm, military values. Ah, military values are, are typical values that you would expect, uhm, honor, integrity, courage, commitment, loyalty, respect and devotion to duty. Uhm, devotion to duty is, is, is especially important, uhm, because one of the things that characterizes, ah, military personnel is this drive to get the mission done, to drive or to do what they're supposed to do at all cost. And when this doesn't happen, the persons really do become upset. They don't, they don't feel complete. They feel, they feel failure. Uhm so, one of the, the issues that is often talked about when we talk about any war for example is we can't end the war unless we change the mission to something that is accomplishable, ah, and inherently, fighting terrorism is something that won't get done, and so it puts all of our service members in a bad spot. They can't capture that. They can't compete the mission, and it's the same kind of, ah, that same kind of uneasiness, that same kind of dread, that I, that I feel for them is the same thing that happened from the Vietnam era vets. They could not win. I mean when you would have never defined in a term that would allow them to say, "I've completed my mission," and it's really important to, ah, remember that concept because even when they're talking to you in civilian life, life would be framed in terms of mission, getting it done, getting the mission done and you will actually hear the word, and to the extent that you can use that word, it really helps in building the therapeutic alliance- 

00:12:35
I am an American Soldier. I am a Warrior and member of a team. I serve the people of the United States, and I live the Army Values. I always place the mission first. I will never quit. I will never leave a fallen comrade. I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills. I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself. I am an expert, and I am a professional. I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States of America in close combat. I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life. I am an American Soldier. The Soldier's Creed. 

00:12:35
DR. HERBERT EXUM - because it's important, very important. Military virtues, all the values, virtues, and, and, uhm, precepts are best actually summed up in the, the soldiers creed, and I'm not gonna' read that to you, but I, you could read this at you leisure. But, this really does describe in many ways how most service members, whether they're Army, Navy, Marines, really do think about themselves. They think about their devotion to the service and they think about what is honorable to and right for them. This creed pretty much sums it up. 

00:13:15
DR. HERBERT EXUM Uhm, military virtues are the standards of more, ah, morality in the, in the military. Uhm, you might be surprised that peacefulness is actually a military virtue. What peacefulness means is that soldiers would prefer to keep the peace than to fight war. Ah, they would prefer to make things settle than unsettle. They would prefer construction rather than destruction. Uhm, but often times peacekeeping involves violence. And so, even though violence is inherent in the military, the main virtue is peacefulness. I'm fighting only because I want to stop a greater evil. All right. Restraint means using as little force as necessary to accomplish whatever military objective you might have. It means using the least destructive way to accomplish the mission. It means being able to particularly, being able to distinguish between civilians and combatants and not harming civilians, which in wars, like the one we have now, which is about impossible because anybody can be a combatant. Again there are no uniforms and the enemy does in fact hide within the, the same place, the same domicile as civilians. Obedience, obedience means, obedience to the chain of command, uhm, doing what, carrying out your orders, doing that to maintain cohesion. Ah, obedience doesn't mean that you are, ah, that soldiers are required to carry out a law or a rule that they think is unjustifiable or is immoral, all right? But functionally, the chain of command takes control, so people do what they're told. 

00:15:00
DR. HERBERT EXUM Okay, the major of military precepts again are chain of command, the Geneva conventions, ah, just worked out during rules of engagement and the unified code of military justice. Uhm, I think most of you are pretty familiar with what chain of command means, uhm, that is orders coming down and people subservient, taking orders from those above. Inherent in a notion of chain of command is that any order that will come down is actually correct. It's legal. It's been well thought out, so people just do it. And most of the time it works that way, sometimes it doesn't. Uhm, but that's what the chain of command is about. The Geneva Convention is really to do, the (inaudible ), a newer conventions. It's several, uhm, documents that describe how prisoners of war should be treated, what types of weapons should be used, what is essentially legal and illegal behavior in warfare. Uhm, most military people take pride and suspect(ph), uhm, adhering to the Geneva Conventions. But lately, we also, we have questionable behavior as in the case of torture. Uhm, and ah, Torture is not called torture sometimes. It's called, ah, aggressive interrogation, uhm, but it, in fact it is torture, and torture is forbidden by the Geneva conventions, but somehow it happens. And so for people that are career military, it's very hard to accept that the United States itself is doing things that it has always accused other nations of doing, uhm, and the problem we have again is the definitions to kind of change. We have drifting terms, uhm, and it's, ah, decrease a lot of stress internal, uhm, creates these kind of ethical dilemmas for our service members that they'll bring back with them as well. The Just War doctrine is, uhm, ah, really important because this is the, all military people believe that when they're fighting in a war, it's a just war. They believe that when they've been sent to do something that protects the values of our country, protects the citizens of another country and is based on this- 

00:17:10
DR. HERBERT EXUM  -principle, Just War Doctrine. Uhm, the first part of the principle is that war is the last resort. You've tried everything else you could to prevent war, and war now has taken place because (inaudible ) failed. There's nothing else that could get done. You have to have a war in order to solve this problem, all right? And there must be a just cause for a war. The cause cannot be revenge, all right? Revenge is not a just cause. Ah, the cause cannot be greed; ah, greed is not a just cause. A just cause must be something that will really correct something that is wrong in a society. Ah, it would this ah, it will do something to protect others. Ah, the benefits of the war should, uhm, certainly outweigh the cause, that is, before someone starts a war, should we, we should think about is this really worth doing it? Is this the most cost effective way of solving this problem? The war must be authorized. In the United States, that means that Congress must say yes, there's a war. In fact, however, the president has quite a bit of latitude in distributing, deploying, uhm, armed forces. So, that doesn't get attended too often. And ah, most of all, the use of force must be, ah, limited. That means having restraint and must not be, ah, motivated by hate or revenge. This is the, the moral basis of military action in our country. Fortunately, uhm, most wars, ah, adhere to this, ah, but not all. 

00:18:45
Rules for conducting a military operation 

00:18:45
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Rules of Engagement. Ah, rules of engagement really are, ah, the law of war. What are the specific actions you can and cannot take in conducting a war? Ah, typically, it translates into who you can shoot at if you're fired upon. Can you shoot return fire? Uhm, can you, ah, go into someone's home? Ah, can you pursue the enemy across borders, things like that. Uhm, the rules of engagement are both a source of pride and frustration for our service members, ah, first of all because the rules of engagement are typically made by people who are not actually in the war zone. They are typically made by people who are thinking about what would be a good way to do this or how we should do this operation. They are very difficult to change, and in the other part, part of frus, the frustrating part is that, of course the enemy knows that we have rules of engagement, but they don't, and so they know that much of what an armed force can do is constrained by these rules and they don't have to abide by them at all, so it does give them a slight advantage, or that's how servicemen was, were reporting. Uhm, one of the things that does happen and it's often a, a source of, ah, pride, I mean, a source of shame for post-service member is filing the rules of engagement. Knowing what they are, but isn't(ph) seen that they must do something differently. And, even if they take an action that they believe is necessary and right at that particular time, they still suffer from violating the rules of engagement. So, it just doesn't go away. It's not just like, uhm, uhm, changing, uhm, a deadline. 

00:20:30
Cultural Difference 

00:20:30
DR. HERBERT EXUM It makes a big difference. Can't we back it up, a little nutshell, the big difference is, as I see them at least between, ah, civilian culture and military culture, appear here in this slide, uhm, civilian culture, uhm, I'm talking about American civilian culture, emphasizes on individuality, individual achievement, personal freedom, fluid social relationships. Ah, in the military, the emphasis is definitely on unit cohesion and whatever it takes to maintain the new cohesion. Uhm, the emphasis is definitely on the mission, that is, getting the job done, following the rules, being efficient and making sure it happens, extreme devotion to duty and the chain of command. Uhm, chain of command doesn't really exist in the same way, uhm, in civilian society that, that you think about supervisor and supervisee. It's much more different, it's, it's, and it's much more, it's much more engrained, much more emotional. Uhm, the biggest surprise for me was how, how long service members consider this, continue to see themselves as members of the military even when they've been out, (inaudible ) people, that is really good for me because the Vets, have ah, Vet, Vietnam Vet is not at the same age. So, you would still have people wearing heavy military haircut. You would still have them using military language, I mean, and they just(ph) when they started to talk to me 'coz they didn't talk to me for a long time ago, but once they decided that I was an okay person, even though as a civilian, they started to, to really treat me as though I was a member of their unit. And they, all of those behaviors are still there. Ah, sharp creased pants, ah, all the things that will make you think someone's still in the military. That was, that was amazing to me that they had not really changed. They had not (inaudible ). Ah, most of their friends from milita, almost all of their friends in military, if they had friends, they were all mil, ex-military, and they all saw themselves as still part of the military. So, that was the biggest surprise for me, uhm, and that is when I started to see how important it was for me to know military language, ah, for me to never have to question what they were saying to me. Ah, when they started to use, ah, acronym, jargons, and so forth. And, that was the way that they communicate with everybody, including their own family. Now, my own father was, uhm, from, a, a, he was in the Navy and a lot of the language I had, that I gathered from him, I thought it was just a adult language. But it was really Navy language, ah, because he always talked about getting things squared away. So please say, survey (inaudible ) ah, you can do this detail. And but I just thought that's what adult said, but no, that's, that's really military language. But I just grew up that way so, I, I didn't know any difference. Uhm, but that was a big surprise for me that now it's there. Once it's there, it's there. And, uhm, unless you do something to try to change it, it's gonna always be there. And I'm not saying that it's bad at all. I'm just saying that it's, it's important to understand that that's gonna be an aspect of that person that you're working with, male or female, it's just gonna be there. 

00:23:45
Air Force Special Operations Command Delta Force Force Reconnaissance Navy SEALS Special Forces (Green Berets) 

00:23:45
DR. HERBERT EXUM Uhm, I talked a little bit about status in the military. Uhm, and you probably know about the differences between officers, uhm, and enlisted personnel, we just mentioned career, ah, versus reserve personnel. And then, of course, there are the regular, ah, versus the elite forces, and these are all of our elite forces here. Ah, one of the things that I, ah, found interesting is that I never saw anyone at the Vet Center, ah, that was in Special Forces... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
DR. HERBERT EXUM ...or that had been a SEAL, ah, or even an Army Ranger. And I don't know if that make difference because their training was different, they were better prepared for what they did, or they just wouldn't come in because it was too much shame involved in being in elite military specialist and still having a post-traumatic stress disorder or some other type of ailment, ah, but I never saw any. I only saw one officer that was a male. Uhm, several officers there were women who had been army, army nurses and navy nurses, but I didn't see any officers in either. I know the training is different, and I know the experience is typically different. Now, ah, one of the things that, uhm, that I came to find also in working with the Veterans, is that I didn't know that some people really were Anti-Military, just really did not like anybody in the military and that's really unusual in some from North Carolina. That's a big military state. But I found out that there's, ah, historically, there's been a tension between mil, members of the military and the civilian population that some place is just really pretty negative for military people. Uhm, and- 

00:25:20
Sociopolitical and Philosophical Cultural Tensions 

00:25:20
DR. HERBERT EXUM  -the literatures suggest these reasons, uhm, for this type of tension that exists between the military and non-military people. Uhm, the first one is the, a, customer service provider relationship. Ah, that means that the military really provide a service for civilians but the service that they provide is best provided well away from civilian. So there's a type of remoteness that people don't wanna know about. They want you to do it but don't tell me too much about what you're doing. And what this does is create a psychological distance because you're not really working with the customer and the service provider, really don't work closer together and that customer doesn't want to be close to the service provider. All right. There's also, this civilian ambivalence about, uhm, the power that military ha, has. Well, of course, the military has weapons, well-armed, well-trained, well-organized, and so there's always this thought that suppose the military doesn't give back the weapons, suppose they decide they want to run the country. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
 Uh hmm. (inaudible ) 

00:26:33
DR. HERBERT EXUM Ah, they're good at running things, they already have everything. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
 Yeah. 

00:26:35
DR. HERBERT EXUM So we really have to make sure, we have to watch them because they may just decide they're gonna take over. You know, and so, there's this tension there and that plays itself out in Congress and elsewhere, ah, but that's there as well. Our, and then, there's the, the military principle of unit cohesion. Because the military believes in cohesion, they tend to stick with each other, and they tend to push away, actually push away civilians because civilians are not part of the unit cohesion. They're not part of the military. They're not part of the culture. So these things, working together, create a sort of tension in, in place in some parts of the country, ah, between the military and service department. And that's one reason why, uhm, also that military people, ah, are worried about civilians. They're not sure how they're gonna be received and not just because, uhm, from the Vietnam, their experience when people who really received them, but even now, people are still unsure how they would be receiving if somewhat those that served in military they're not quite sure. 

00:27:40
 I see(ph). 

00:27:40
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Uhm, I often ask my, I ask my students every, every time we have a new class entering, uhm, who's served in the military, and probably anybody will ever raise the hand. Maybe the next semester, somebody will admit, okay, I was in the military, but people even until(ph) this day wouldn't say (inaudible ). 

00:28:01
(Davenport,1987) To ensure regional stability, promote productive relationships, defend allies and "friends" and fight wars when necessary (Miskel, 2001) (Zelikow,2005) 

00:28:01
DR. HERBERT EXUM Well, what is the mission of the military? I've been talking about mission all morning so far and I, there are two general ways to talk about mission. One is the, a specific operation that you do, and another is, has to do with overall functions and roles. These, uhm, in a nutshell, are the basic, this is the mission of the American Military right now: to promote the safety and welfare of humanity in general, uhm, to ensure regional stability, and to implement the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. 

00:28:40
Equal justice Religious tolerance (Zelikow,2005) 

00:28:40
DR. HERBERT EXUM These are nonnegotiable, uhm, demands are, are essentially, the values, attitudes and the behaviors that are supposed to characterize democracy when it is given to another country. So, these things are supposed to, to have, the country should achieve the rule of law, uhm, limits of power of the state, respect for women, private speech, or private free speech, private property and so forth. And it is the role now of the military to actually enforce this to make sure that whoever the military is engaged with accepts these values. So, this is part of Bush(ph) doctrine. 

00:29:20
  Uh-huh. 

00:29:25
DR. HERBERT EXUM So, this is what should happen, and that is what, this is the one we have expressed what the military does. 

00:29:30
To protect American interests outside the U.S. including guaranteeing access to strategic commodities To promote (and enforce) world stability 

00:29:30
DR. HERBERT EXUM All right. The mission also includes protecting American interest outside the U.S., uhm, implementing, uhm, foreign policy, and of course engaging in mili-op, in military operations that support U.S. national security objectives. Uhm, and this last one is, is, uhm, fairly fluent because exactly what is, a, a, national security objective changes fairly often. But the military can get sent if it is deemed that way. So, that's why you'll see sometimes say in a Gulf War, where we have terrible of humanitarian conflict that no service members are deployed there because it's not a security objective. Uhm, while at the same token, we have people still in Bosnia and in Korea for that matter, had been in the last 50 years, because it is a security objective. So, that's how things get done, that's how missions get defined. Forward presence is, ah,-

DR. HERBERT EXUM An old concept and what it really means is having lots of military bases all over, all over the world. It means, being prepared to go somewhere, quickly to be somewhere quickly by being pre-deployed essentially, uhm, I still not recall forward presence, uhm, Lumps Ville(ph) that's called in the lilypod(ph) approach, uhm, so, you could (inaudible ) from place to place, but it's essentially the same thing. Uhm, so there're hundreds of military bases everywhere, uhm, and United States keeps trying to increase the number of bases in order to make sure that they can be where it needs to be. Uhm, then we have special operations, uhm, which is just a small scale types of wars, ah, because almost all of these conflicts could be called wars. And they're design to rescue people, ah, counter insurgency and then peacekeeping. Uhm, peacekeepers also are special group, ah, because they, by their very nature, they don't want to engage in combat, uhm, but they almost always wind up, uhm, in combat as well and so, it's, ah, particularly difficult carrying out this mission because the mission of peacekeeping is violence(ph). 

00:31:45
The last declared "war" the U.S. fought was World War II Special operations are inherently dangerous because they are still military operations. "Peacekeeping" and "humanitarian operations" are real military operations and do constitute a war zone experience for those deployed 

00:31:45
DR. HERBERT EXUM Ah, the last declared war we had was, uhm, World War II. Everything else since then has been a police action, uhm, or it's been, uhm, a limited engagement and it's, it's been something, ah, but it's not been a declared war, ah, even though we know they really are wars. Uhm, and peacekeeping and humanitarian operations as I've been saying before, are really a war zone experience because the same kind of conditions that characterize war will also characterize these (inaudible ). Uhm, the Military itself does provide mental health services. Uhm, they provide psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and chaplains. They do not provide any mental health counselors. Uhm, legislation is being worked on now to, to rec, ah, rectify this situation, but right now, mental health counselors are not part of, of military counseling. 

00:32:40
Active Duty Counseling Issues 

00:32:40
DR. HERBERT EXUM Uhm, the major issues that active duty people bring up, uhm, and this is from the literature and of what people told me, uhm, are faith issues, uhm, stress and anxiety, uhm, redeployment or reunion issues, ah, moral and ethical values conflicts, ah, requests for leaves and requests for hardship discharges. The person does most after hearing any of these, ah, concerns with the chaplain, ah, because even though the chaplain is part of the chain of command, uhm, soldiers are very reluctant to seeing anybody else. That is, uhm, what, anybody with active duties are reluctant to see anyone else that's a health service provider. Ah, they feel most comfortable with chaplains even though they don't trust chaplains as, as well either. Uhm, but that's what they have, have to see. You're not going to see, ah, a psychologist, never see a psychiatrist and it's just, just not gonna happen. And I, I do know, ah, there is one person that I know that does see active duty personnel, all days, uhm, and, uhm, she does see them for, uhm, employee assistance issues, uhm, so I know people do seek help for those issues but it's, uhm, but they do it at, at their peril- 

00:34:05
Reasons for Avoiding Services Fear of a poor performance rating Fear of losing security clearance No guarantee of confidentiality Fear of appearing weak 

00:34:05
DR. HERBERT EXUM - because they, because of these reasons, they, ah, don't want to, ah, definitely don't want to appear weak, don't want to jeopardize their career, and don't want to, in a fear of their performance requirement. Well, I'm just about at the end of my, my time. Ah, Ms. Menna is gonna take over here. 

00:34:20
What Do I Need to Know about War Zone Induced Trauma? 

00:34:20
AMY MENNA  I want to talk about definitions of trauma which I think is the next slide. We have a medical definition of trauma, which is basically something physical. 

00:34:30
Amy Menna, M.A. 

00:34:30
AMY MENNA I mean, you have blunt force injury. You have something physically. There's- 

00:34:35
Definitions of Trauma Medical definition--sudden and dramatic tissue loss and violent disruption of normal functioning in one or more organ systems. 

00:34:35
AMY MENNA - physically wrong with you. Then we have a psychological definition; sudden negative changes in an individual's normal level of functioning. Then we have our definition of trauma, which is a severe and sudden disruption and/or failure of an individual's ability to tolerate, assimilate or accommodate an event or the report of that event into his or her cognitive schema. And again, I wanna highlight the report of an event, because we think trauma and we would think of something happening. Why do you think we added a report of the event? Why do you think we added that? Why do you think we added a report of an event? What do you think will happen in the military that would happen? 

00:35:25
  Secondary trauma. 

00:35:30
AMY MENNA Secondary trauma. Because what happens in the military is not what happens to you, but what happens to fellow soldiers. So, you have a report that somebody went on a mission, somebody, something happened and you have report. And that- 

00:35:45
Definition Problems Trauma is highly subjective It is not possible to determine who will experience a trauma It is not possible to know the specific characteristics of an event that will make it traumatic for a particular individual 

00:35:45
AMY MENNA - can be very traumatic. Trauma can be very subjective. What would be traumatic to you may not be traumatic to me. And that's really the most important thing that I find communicated to someone, is, it's your definition. Because if they wanna quantify that, but you see that all the time. Why is it that date? Why is it that that happened? I can see you nodding. Why is it that that happened on that day and that bothered me? Because, I had something, you know, horribly traumatic happened, you know, I had ah, a bomb go off, you know, two weeks earlier, and, and something, and I got in a car accident, two weeks later and, and this is highly traumatic. Why is it? They want to quantify that. So, it's highly subjective. So, it's not possible to determine what experience is gonna be traumatic and what's not traumatic. So, it's really important to communicate that to the military personnel. It's nots, it's not able to know what can be traumatic, what's not gonna be traumatic in the specific characteristics of an event, that will make it traumatic or not. 

00:36:55
How does the Military Respond to War Zone Induced Psychological Disorder? The response then follow the "PIES" principle 

00:36:55
AMY MENNA  The military response follows a continuum that begins with prevention. And the response continuum is post, post-battle debriefing, pastoral counseling, which we talked about, which is not really received all that well, and then evacuation from the actual battle area. And an old principle that they follow was PIES- 

00:37:25
PIES Principle 

00:37:25
AMY MENNA - P-I-E-S; Proximity, Immediate, Immediacy Expectancy, and Simplicity. What they wanted to do was they wanted to have early intervention, (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
AMY MENNA provided as close to the soldiers, as close to the soldiers' unit as possible, so they would actually bring somebody in to the unit as opposed to taking the soldier out and providing counseling over here, and would provide counseling as close to the unit as possible with reassured, reassurance that reactions are normal and quickly return to work as quickly as possible, and you're nodding a, again. As quickly as possible, let's wrap this up. 

00:38:10
Marmar et al.,(1995) Normal stress response Acute catastrophic stress reaction Uncomplicated PTSD PTSD co-morbid with other disorders Post traumatic personality (Complex PTSD) 

00:38:10
AMY MENNA Hmm. Uhm, traumatic treatment issues suggest five identifiable post-traumatic syndromes and we're gonna go into these in detail. You have a normal stress response- 

00:38:20
Treatment Issues Complete recovery following individual debriefing Friedman(2004) 

00:38:20
AMY MENNA  -which is a reaction to discrete traumatic event, which is what a lot of people have. They have exploration of emotional reactions. What did this mean to me? What happened? What did I go through? Discussions of the symptoms: What did I go through? Did I have some dreams? What was happening to me? Presentation of the information: This is what normal people go through, or, I can't use the word normal, most people go through. Identification of adaptive coping strategies: these are some things that you can do in order to adapt to the trauma. Then you have, Acute Catastrophic Stress Reaction. 

00:39:05
Involves panic reactions, cognitive disorganization, disorientation, dissociations, insomnia and incapacity for fundamental self-care(Friedman,2004). Requires removal from scene of trauma, medication, and brief supportive psychotherapy(Friedman) 

00:39:05
AMY MENNA  Involves panic reactions, maybe some cognitive disorganization, disorientation, possibly then some dissociation, insomnia, incapacity for fundamental self-care. You know, one thing that I find is when I say things, when I talk DSM language to them, it just simply doesn't, I, I have to watch myself. Are you having intrusive symptoms? Are you having bad dreams? Are you, can, can, are having insomnia? No. Can you not sleep? Oh, yeah. (laughs) I haven't sleep in days. So, it's really important to simplify our language. It's really important to simplify our language. And those require removal from the scene of the traumatic event. Uncomplicated PTSD, the classic DSM intrusive and also avoidance symptoms. There are variety of treatments that will go over here and emphasis on group therapy and peer support. Why do you think we emphasize peer support and group therapy instead of individual in addition to individual? 

00:40:15
 It will help (inaudible ) culture. 

00:40:22
 Yeah. 

00:40:22
AMY MENNA It goes back to the culture. Exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
 There's (inaudible ). 

00:40:27
AMY MENNA It goes back to the culture. We need to draw from this report, we need to use, if, if they have a culture that says, "Banned together," and we need to use that to our advantage. Whatever we can use to our advantage, use it to our advantage. So peer group, group psychotherapy is really one of the advantages that we do have. 

00:40:45
More common than uncomplicated PTSD Co-morbidly typically depression, substance abuse or panic disorder Best results when both disorders treated concurrently(Friedman,2004) 

00:40:45
AMY MENNA Then there is co-morbid PTSD. And we talked about substance abuse. We talked about domestic violence. We talked about depression. Typically you, uhm, it's best when those are treated together. Why put off treating the depression after the PTSD, is how can they, how can they treat, how can they treat PTSD unless they're treating the substance abuse. I'm, I've worked in substance abuse for a long time and had many people who were treating their PTSD with the substance abuse. You know, are you sleeping? Yeah. They sleep just fine after a fi, of Jack Daniels and they sleep fine after they take their pills or after they take their substances. So what they're doing is they're treating their trauma but they're treating it with substance abuse. So you really need to treat those two together. 

00:41:40
Friedman(2004) 

00:41:40
AMY MENNA  And there's complex treat, PTSD which may present an Axis II disorder, impulsivity, aggression, sexual acting out. You may see domestic violence. You may see rage. And again, look at the PTSD, look at the trauma. As we look at them and we think, what do we do? We arrest them. We put them in jail. We give them consequences. And they come home. And what happens. Exactly, it happens again. And we arrest them and we put them to jail and we get them work consequences. And what do they need? They need treatment, exactly. And that's due to prolonged exposure and tro, torture survivors, prisoners of war, and get, (ph) be really careful with that for those. Other treatment issues, again, we talked about depression, substance abuse, military sexual trauma which we're gonna go in-depth about that. Military Sexual Trauma refers both to sexual harassment and sexual assault. And we miss, we don't miss. They miss sexual harassment- 

00:42:55
(Street & Stafford, 2003). 

00:42:55
AMY MENNA - coz they think, "Was I sexually assaulted?" No. "Did they did actually touch me?" No. "Was I harassed every single day for months?" Yes. And it's really important to know that both men and women are victims of this. Rates of attempted or completed sexual assault are six percent for women and one percent for men. Perpetrators are frequently peers and supervisors. And one thing that I wanna go back, to which Dr. Exum talked about, is chain of command. So here, I say that perpetrators are often peers or supervisors. And on the other hand, Dr. Exum was saying, "Follow the chain of command." So what do you do? What do you do if you're a sexual assault survivor and it was a supervisor and you're supposed to follow the chain of command? 

00:43:50
Reasons for Underreporting Victims believe there is no safe way to report sexual victimization Victims are unwilling to threaten unit cohesion Street and Stafford (2003) 

00:43:50
AMY MENNA  And that's what a lot of these women are faced with or it's your peers, and one of the military cultures is emphasis on the unit. What do you do? So that's what a lot of these women and men are faced with like, uhm, some military sexual harassment and military sexual assault. 

00:44:15
Guidelines for Screening 

00:44:15
AMY MENNA It's important to avoid using the terms like "rape" and "sexual harassment." It gives it a more pejorative term, makes them feel weak, makes something really bad has happened to them. Keep it a very simple process. Again, those are, those sound very therapeutic. Those are some therapy terms that we use. It's like using intrusive (inaudible ) or rape. We like it very simple there, ah,- 

00:44:50
Screening Questions 

00:44:50
AMY MENNA - "While you're at the military, did you ever experience unwanted attention, unwanted sexual attention, verbal remarks, touching and pressure?" It's important to cover "did anybody give you alcohol" because much like civilian life, "Oh, I was drunk, oh, I was using substances." "Did anybody give you those substances, Did anybody forced or threatened force to have sex with you against your will?" And one thing is "I will expose you to your superior officer. I will do this. I will do that." Again, think about chain of command. Think about exposure. Think about the shame, so whereas they don't necessarily have to have a gun to their head, exposing them in some way, shape or form. You know, getting kicked out of the military could mean a lot of shame to these women or men, shame to their family, shame to their community, shame to themselves. So, you know, did they, did they threatened anything, not just physical threatening, but did they threaten anything? 

00:45:55
Veterans Administration Hospitals Vet Centers (readjustment counseling service) 

00:45:55
AMY MENNA  Mental Health Services for Veteran. We have the VA Hospitals. We also have Vet Centers. 

00:46:00
Education Coping skills training Cognitive restructuring Exposure therapy Family counseling Pharmacological 

00:46:00
AMY MENNA  And then treatment approaches. I wanted to make a comment, going back to the Soldier's Creed. Now, most of us here accult, are counselors. The Soldier's Creed says that "I will always place the mission first. I will never accept the defeat. I will always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself. And I am an, an expert and a professional." Now, when talking about "I wanna come treat you, I wanna come help you, but I'm always supposed to maintain myself, but I'm the expert," so you see right there we have a, a contradiction. You're going against the creed. So when I work with somebody in this capacity, it's, it's an honor to do so. And I go in very slow because what I'm doing is I'm working against the creed. I'm asking that we go against the creed. Some treatment approaches is basic education, sometimes recognition and understanding of symptoms. Sometimes it's a blessing to know that these dreams that you're having is they're normal symptoms of PTSD, these thoughts that you're having, the fact that you don't wanna go to the store to know that that's the normal, those are symptoms of something called, and this is where I may use the term, post-traumatic stress disorder or something that's reactive to trauma. And sometimes, education, we have a big sigh of release. You know, this is something normal. This is something, this is not something in my head. This is not something weak. So sometime, education will reduce the fear of shame as an explanation of recovery process. You will go through this. Maybe you need to talk about it. The dreams may lessen. The thoughts may lessen. The rage may lessen. So simply an understanding of the recovery process may help normalize what they're going through, variable(ph). 

00:48:35
(FOA, Keanne & Friedman, 2000) 

00:48:35
AMY MENNA  Cognitive restructuring, addressing their relationships between thoughts and their emotions, again, going back to the creed, "I am the professional. I can do. I maintain myself." Well, you know, you may need a little help here, you know, going back to those thoughts, how they go with the emotions, develops alternative interpretations of feelings and behaviors. How are you interpretating the world? Is this based, you know, was this an attack on you? Did you interpret this this way? How did your thoughts and feelings go together? And this is, uhm, one of the best, CBT is one of the best validated treatments for PTSD. Exposure therapy, narrative therapy of a dream, visualization, the MDR, some exposure to therapies. Be very careful with these, very careful confronting the traumatic-related memories and emotions, repeated verbalization of incidents that trouble veterans. Again, be very careful of these. 

00:49:55
Family Counseling Consistent long-term family support facilitates reintegration and recovery Address issues pertinent to each family Family education Couples counseling Parenting workshops Conflict resolution skills training Ruzek, et al.(2003) 

00:49:55
AMY MENNA  Family counseling, very important. Bring the family into it because you, ah, may have a wife or a husband or kids at home. But again, whoever you have, if you have other team members, bring them in, bring in whatever you have. Use all the weapons that you have. Consistent long-term family support facilitates reintegration of the military personnel like to the family. Family education, maybe couples counseling, maybe parenting. Again, if you come back and you have a lot of anxiety and you have a toddler, that's not a very good mix. 

00:50:40
Pharmacological One course for Acute Stress Reactions Another course for chronic PTSD 

00:50:40
AMY MENNA  Pharmacological treatments used for chronic PTSD and acute PTSD. 

00:50:50
Pharmacological treatment Serotonin Specific Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) Low-dose Anti-psychotics 

00:50:50
AMY MENNA  You have some SSRIs and beta-blockers, sometimes anti-psychotics. At times, mood stabilizers are used. Again, that would be at the discretion of psychiatrist. If you are working with a psychiatrist, work with them closely, talk to each other, let them know that, that the military personnel know that you're all on the same team. I find it, they find it very comforting when I say, "Yes, I talk to Dr. so and so." It's like, "Oh, that's so." You know him and you talk to him. You're not just sending me somewhere to get some phantom (ph) medication. 

00:51:30
Friedman(2004) 

00:51:30
AMY MENNA  There are three pha, three phases in establishing trust and safety that can take a while, because as we were saying, you're not military personnel in there. There tends to be at times, either you're in or you're out and you're an outside person. And establishing safety and trust may take some time. So establish safety and trust. Explore traumatic materials in depth and then disconnect the client from the trauma and reconnect him or her with the family, friends and society. Concentrate on listening. Let them be the expert. Concentrate on listening. Focus on establish the therapeutic alliance that's really important. Acknowledge the veteran's sacrifice and commitment to duty. Find and acknowledge the veteran's strengths. And preparing for homecoming. 

00:52:35
The Cycle of Separation and Reunion Pre-deployment Deployment Sustainment Redeployment Post deployment Kennedy (2004) 

00:52:35
AMY MENNA  There are several phases. The cycle of separation and reunion. There's pre-deployment where they receive the orders, and right away, there's a disruption in the family role(ph), start to engage in social withdrawal coz they're getting ready to talk about, Dr. Exum, talk about boot camp where you go from civilian to military. So you get the orders and you start preparing and withdrawing from going from civilian to military. So immediately, there's engaging in so, social withdrawal. Then there's deployment. That's where the actual separation of the service members. And there's a period of adjustment, separation issues among the children. Again, that's where family counseling can come in. Period of sustainment is where the end of the first month of deployment to the first month prior in the, to the return. That's where they've gone from, they have successfully gone from civilian to military, acceptance of new roles or routines. They've gone from daddy to navy seal. Greatest exposure to war zone stressors. And this is where the maximum separation. Coz when you think, coz I, I have worked with the navy seal before, think about daddy to navy seal. How, how great of separation can that be? 

00:54:15
The Cycle of Separation and Reunion Redeployment (Homecoming) Return-physical reunion Time of mixed emotions Importance of rituals Readjustment Attention to differences Expression of clinical difficulties Reintegration Efforts to recognize and accept changes Parallels "post-deployment" (Meteczun & Holmes, 1996) 

00:54:15
AMY MENNA  Then there's redeployment, when you have to go from navy seal back to being a father again, time of mixed emotions. We assume, "Oh, great. You get to home." Well, no, it's a transition. It's always a transition. And then in a transition, it's gonna be difficult. So there's an importance of rituals there, importance of coming home, importance of attention to differences, exposure, expression of political difficulties. There are difficulties there. Sometimes, we have this, "He's home. Isn't that great?" No, he just transitioned again. And there is reintegration. 

00:55:00
Living in isolation and avoiding intimacy Use of hurtful language and rage Wilson and Wilson(1985) 

00:55:00
AMY MENNA  There are signs of poor readjustment. We're gonna go into these in detail. Viewing the veteran as the "identified patient." That's where family counseling comes in, is the veteran is not the only patient, the only client that needs treatment. Scapegoating is not helpful. Because as I say, you know, the veteran needs to adjust. Well think about take a wife or a father. I just went from single parent to having a husband at home. So there's readjustment there. Living in isolation, social isolation, externally indif, indifference to the veteran. It's very important to look at social isolation, coz it means they're not reintegrating into their home. (inaudible ) to the avoiding intimacy is also poor communication. Financial instability may indicate poor work. It may indicate substance abuse. And it may indicate, uhm, more family disintegration. Use of hurtful language may indicate PTSD. Again, we have the anxiety, we have the rage. You know, is he or she using more hurtful, that's a good indicators, using more hurtful language. It means swearing more. Is he using more derogatory comments? You know, what is different? Are there things that are different, significantly different from time he left or she left to the time she came home? Poor in personal communication and family distress, inappropriate responses to loss, possible emotional numbing, feelings of rejection. And then unspoken rules, you know, is there a tense family household? Are there unspoken rules? Are there, is it a military household again? 

00:57:15
(Wilson&Wilson, 1985) 

00:57:15
AMY MENNA And then goals for family therapy is to establish shared responsibility and mutual respect, trust in order to create change. Again, everybody is changing. Everybody's changing. Clarify family values and rules that adults occupy. Agree on rules for healthy expression of anger coz you don't have to go, "Okay, there's no anger in here. We're gonna have a healthy relationship. Nobody gets angry." Finding a way for veterans to express a painful war zone experience. You can express to me. And it's okay. Sometimes, they come home and think nobody wants to hear about it. But that's not true. Skills training to overcome deficiencies in the family system. 

00:58:00
Interaction in Non-clinical settings 

00:58:00
AMY MENNA  Interaction. Context is important. And questions about the services are okay, what branch were in, what branch were you in? What did you do? Where were you stationed? What did, what did you specialize in? 

00:58:15
Typical veteran thoughts about communication with civilians 

00:58:15
AMY MENNA Typical thoughts. Civilians don't actually care about their experiences. Again, nobody cares. They just want me home. Or, they just want me home. You know, like, I'm home. I just wanna put it behind me. Every, even if they do care, they can't understand or they're not serious about anything. 

00:58:35
After Verbal Report of a Traumatic Event 

00:58:35
AMY MENNA  Something that would be helpful to them is "I'm sorry that had happened to you," "I'm sorry that you're struggling with that," "I can appreciate how difficult this must be for you," It's really affirming statements. And again, you can teach this to the parent, teach this to the spouse. How do you engage with him or her? 

00:59:05
Wrap up 

00:59:05
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Most military personnel are not gonna come back, ah, to post-traumatic stress disorder. But they're gonna come back change in some way or another. 

00:59:15
Most military personnel do not become psychological casualties in the war zone Acute Stress Reactions are very common after exposure to severe combat. Some veterans may return to civilian life with a stress reaction that meets the criteria for Acute Stress Disorder Litz and Orsillo, 2003 

00:59:15
DR. HERBERT EXUM  Uhm, every (inaudible ) or feeling that they have won't be (inaudible ). Ah, some will come back really, ah, depressed. Some will come back disillusioned. Some will come back, uhm, having lost faith in God, ah, lost faith in the country. Some will come back very confused. 

00:59:35
AMY MENNA  Uh-huh. Some will come back crippled. 

00:59:40
DR. HERBERT EXUM Yes, yes, and that is really true. They come back physically crippled. 

00:59:45
AMY MENNA Yes. 

00:59:45
DR. HERBERT EXUM Yes, and some will come back, uhm, many more now, ah, because body and will come back with many close-head injuries. And so there will symptoms that come from that as well that they might not even expect by the way. Ah, so we have a host of things that can be expected from our, from, from our returning veterans. Ah, but again, it's, everything is not post-traumatic stress disorder. 

01:00:10
Most veterans do not suffer from the symptoms of PTSD PTSD is also characterized by delayed onset High numbers of reservists and National Guard combatants increases the likelihood of civilian//veteran counseling The number of veterans and military families that interact with civilian mental health personnel will continue to increase 

01:00:10
DR. HERBERT EXUM Ah, most veterans will come back, knowing that they, or having some difficulty adjusting, adjusting. And, ah, for example, one, uhm, one person that I do know just came back maybe in, uhm, January, uhm, had a hard, had a very hard time, ah, driving in a speed limit and staying, uhm, in one lane because if you're in a war zone, you'll drive as fast as possible. You never stop. You don't look back. Just keep going. And he could not control his driving. And he, he did not know why he couldn't control. And also as Ms. Menna was saying there was, ah, uhm, the same person, uhm, said he was tired all of the time. And he couldn't figure out why. And, ah, again, uhm, the reason he was tired all the time is because he stayed up all night watching movies because he couldn't sleep. But it didn't occur to him that he was staying up the whole night. Part of that were jet lag because he (inaudible ) around the world. But the other part will (ph) just not being able to adjust to not being in the war zone. So there's some push and pull. I desperately want to be back and safe, but I wanna make sure my buddies are safe, too. I wanna make sure that mission is accomplished. So it's really hard to get that, ah, that adjustment, uhm, for most people. And it takes of while. Most people will be successful. And most people will come back to their families that are gonna be understanding. But one of the rituals that is really important for veterans and probably won't take place, there'll not gonna be any parades. Uhm, there's not gonna be a formal welcome back to society. Each person is gonna have to come back the way that they did on Vietnam as individual, come back and just here you are. You're back again. And so what, now? Start all over again, just becoming ignored (ph). All of us to say that I, I, I know all of you can be effective, uhm, it's really important to remember that we're dealing with people from another culture even if they don't seem like they're from another culture they really are. And we're gonna have a little, uhm, attention in terms of getting to know us that we are civilians. It's, ah, for all the reasons we spoke of, it's difficult to establish trust. But it does take place. It can be successful and particularly with the reservists and, uhm, National Guard members, uhm, you have a very good chance of, ah, of, of seeing clients that you can work with, also because the VA cannot, no matter how much you try and see everybody walk on them (ph) that needs the help, you're gonna really need to be there to help out. So I think that's it. Thank you.
