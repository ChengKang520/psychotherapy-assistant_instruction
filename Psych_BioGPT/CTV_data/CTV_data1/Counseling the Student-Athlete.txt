DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hello I'm Dr. Adam Zagelbaum and welcome to this video on working with student athletes. Uh, the main reason that we are filming this is to engage the role of the school counselor when it comes to assisting student athletes that are making major life decisions regarding their academic and uh, athletic careers. Uh, essentially I think it is known, uh, from so many studies as well as uh, common knownledge that playing sports can be a tremendous benefit to any type of individual be it from a social perspective, be it from an interpersonal perspective, certainly the benefit of physical exercise and certainly, uh, things that involve uh, being enganged in a school setting, can be enhanced in many ways by actively participating in sports. Tremendous benefits exist on so many levels. But we also know from the academic personal social and career uh, domains of the asker model that there are also amount of expectations that students much face, there are so many issues that are encountered by, uh, k-12 students especially in our contemporary times, that impact, uh, directions and progress that they are to make. Uh, when we consider the, the demands of the student athlete, there are so many things that must be considered for their development, well being, and decision making. Certainly there are uh, guidelines that are available uh, through the internet and in printed sources that are all reflected in the major collegiate institutions, the NCAA, the national collegiate athletic association, uh, NIA, the national associate of intercollegiate athletics, and the national junior college athletic association, the NJCAA are all the three major institutions that uh oversee the uh, the elligiblity requirements for student athletes at the level beyond high school. Um, but there are regulations vary in terms of programs in terms of year and interms of various other factors that school counselors and other school stakeholders are encouraged to visit early often and continually as these um, let's just call them requirements adjust. Uh, the main core requirements for student athletes however, uh, remain a minimum GPA, um, minimum scores, uh, to maximum scores possible on the, uh, SAT or ACT, uh, course requirements that normally center around 16 core courses in uh, particular subject areas. Graduation from high school or the equivalent, uh, of a high school diploma thereof. And of course acceptance into the collegiate program. Uh, certainly those pressures alone can create a lot of issues and concerns for student athletes. The school counselor often effectively engages in many of the protocol associated with these applications, but sometimes the personal social and sometimes the pressures and stress words that experienced by the student athlete uh, can create dialogue and concerns that may not otherwise get addressed unless somebody as a school counselor, is able to join in this dialog. Uh, sometimes, uh, student athletes may not seek out the school counselor for such, uh, uh, a need based on relationships that they normally have with coaches. Based on relationships that they may have with teachers. And based on relationships that they may have with parents. And there's also sometimes a stigma associated with seeking out a school counselor in that if you're trying to perform athletically and academically in a particular way, the use of a school counselor may call attention to some negative effects, or negative dynamic or some negative, um, perception that may otherwise make the otherwise um, high achieving and highly motivated student athlete to believe that uh, seeing somebody for this type of service may, uh, put a, kaibosh or derailing or um, negative weight to issues that may otherwise be uh, something expected of the student athlete to deal with on his or her own. And so the purpose of this video is to therefore demystify that, and to show the benefits that the student athlete can receive from engaging in a dialogue with school counselors, as well as how school counselors can effectively consult and interface with school stakeholders that benefit the work that the student athlete performs. How to work with coaches, teachers, administrators and family members, are, are critical in being able to help the student athlete and their social surround provide support in encouragement and at the same time a real world dialogue that allows for effective decision making to occur. We should also point out that at the time that we're filming this video, which we did not know would occur, uh, there is also major media attention being placed right now on, uh, NCAA schools and other collegiate institutions for uh, improper, um, enforcing of standards and violations that are occurring in the way in which student athletes on the collegiate level are making, um, poor decisions or ineffective decisions to engage, uh, in on and off the filed antics. Some are surrounding recruiting, and other things in their personal social, uh, lives that may otherwise indicate that there are reasons to blame student athletes and coaches and teachers for um, ineffectively dealing with these matters. And it should be known to that uh, out of all the athletes and student athletes that exist uh, in this uh, time, that only about two percent of these, uh, overall um, populations, go on to, uh play professional sports or athletics at a level that uh, reflects a lot of what this media attention is sometimes placed on. So, I think it's important too to recognize that there are many, many types of student athletes and there are many many types of issues they encounter, and it's not necessarily the fairest thing to assume based on media coverage and sensationalized coverage of uh, improprieties that suggest that the school counselor and the issues that the student athlete encounter um, cannot be handled in a pragmatic or effective manner. So the scenarios that we have for this video involve two particular students. Kelsey (ph) who is a senior about to pursue a decision regarding what she wishes to do at the next level regarding her athletics and academics, and Tommy, who is a, uh, middle-of-the-road sophomore, junior student who is, uh, attempting in many ways, to deal with the academic expectations, uh, placed on him, uh, also relating to his athletic performance. So in so doing this, we hope this dialogue in the reflections that all the role players are, uh, able to put forward in the um, insights and materials that we will hopefully provide you both visually and through references that we will place throughout the video will inform professionals, professional counselors and other stakeholders about how to use these resources effectively, and how to therefore engage in a encouraging and supporting dialogue that will benefit all types of student athletes and their stakeholders and social support systems when it comes to making their major life decisions. So with that, we encourage you to watch this video and stimulate your discussions and um, appropriate questions and concerns about how to work with student athletes in a way that I think will truly benefit all and allow for all to succeed at their goals and accomplishments.

ASHLEY So, Kelsey, thank you for coming in today, um, I know you're very busy at the end of this year, um, how'd the end of the year go for you? 

00:09:40
KELSEY Pretty well, senior year, so. 

00:09:40
ASHLEY Yeah? Are you excited or sad like what kind of feelings you going through right now at the end of the year? 

00:09:45
KELSEY Kind of, both. Um, kind of sad because all my friends go to different schools. But overall it's nice to be done with high school. 

00:09:55
ASHLEY Yeah, so you're completely done and you know maybe what you'll be doing next year, have you made a decision on any schools? 

00:10:05
KELSEY Yeah, I'm going to Stanford. 

00:10:05
ASHLEY Congratulations. And when did you make that decision, because, we haven't talked in a while, so- 

00:10:10
KELSEY Yeah, um, in April. 

00:10:10
ASHLEY Oh wow, hey, and is your family excited? 

00:10:15
KELSEY Mmhmm, they're glad I'm staying in California. 

00:10:15
ASHLEY Staying in the same area. 

00:10:20
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:10:20
I.B. stands for: "Internation Baccalaureate" 

00:10:20
ASHLEY Oh, how exciting. So um, I know you and I have talked before, um, some of the things we talked about before just your pressures that have been on you, and um, I know you're a very good student, you've been involved in the IB program, um, tell me what the IB, was for you, and how that, how that played out throughout this year. 

00:10:40
KELSEY Well, IB was, it was like a special academic program where you take certain classes, and they're harder, and then at the end of the year you have to take exams for each subject. And you also have to do community service, and write a long research paper. 

00:10:55
ASHLEY Oh you do? How long is the research paper? 

00:11:00
KELSEY It's about 25 pages. 

00:11:00
ASHLEY Oh wow, and this is just for the entire program, or is that per class. 

00:11:05
KELSEY Um, just for the whole program. 

00:11:05
ASHLEY Oh, okay. What did you end up deciding to write yours on? 

00:11:10
KELSEY Um, I wrote it on English, as a subject and Edgar Allen Poe. 

00:11:15
ASHLEY Oh, okay. Was it very stressful, having to write all that? 

00:11:15
KELSEY Yeah, especially because um, you didn't get a grade for in the class, so in addition to all the schoolwork, you kind of had to do that and it didn't help anything. 

00:11:30
ASHLEY Yeah, well I mean that's a lot to handle at the end of the year. 

00:11:30
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:11:30
"Metaphor" 

00:11:35
ASHLEY So that's all turned in, it's like, I see just like with your body right you can see how much happier you are, like a lot of , uh, the stress has gone away. 

00:11:40
KELSEY Yeah, well it's all done. 

00:11:45
ASHLEY Yeah, you said community service, too, how many hours did you have to do in with community service? 

00:11:50
KELSEY Um, 150. 

00:11:50
ASHLEY Was that per month or semester or- 

00:11:50
KELSEY For two years. 

00:11:55
ASHLEY Okay, now how'd you end up doing your community service? 

00:11:55
KELSEY Oh, we were allowed to do 50, um, 50 hours for varsity sports, so I just used basketball for that, and then I tutored and I volunteered in special ed class. 

00:12:05
Positive Asset Search 

00:12:05
ASHLEY Wow, okay, so tutoring, special ed and basketball. So I know you're an athlete. 

00:12:15
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:12:15
ASHLEY So that must have been nice to use that then- 

00:12:15
KELSEY It was nice. But I think I should have gotten some more hours for it, since- 

00:12:20
ASHLEY You feel like a lot of time is spent playing sports and without the recognition? 

00:12:25
KELSEY Um, yeah, we practice two and a half hours every day, and on Saturdays, morning, and we have games. So it was a big time commitment. 

00:12:35
ASHLEY It sounds like it. And then, oh not to mention your, your time commitment with the program, the IB program. 

00:12:40
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:12:40
ASHLEY And you said harder, now what do you mean by harder with the IB program? 

00:12:45
KELSEY Um, it just moves faster, and we go more in depth with everything. So, it's just more intense. 

00:12:50
"Future Focus" 

00:12:50
ASHLEY Mmhmm, so you had a lot of plate on, or a lot on your plate, you had, you had your community service, you tied it in with basketball, though, you had, um, doing your um, just the, the school work itself, how is that gonna be different for you for next year? 

00:13:10
KELSEY Um, it will be kind of weird, because I'm not going to play basketball next year, on the team, because they're very good, but, um, yeah, I'm not sure, because I kind of had a routine going. And it kind of kept me on track, so I don't know what I'll do without that- 

00:13:25
"Realistic Focus" 

00:13:25
ASHLEY Tell me about your routine, um, like what was, what was kinda your daily schedule? 

00:13:30
KELSEY Um, well I go to school and then right after school we had basketball practice. And then I would go home and eat dinner and do my homework, and then after that I would go and tutor. 

00:13:45
ASHLEY Wow, so, how many hours of sleep did you get every night? 

00:13:50
KELSEY Uh, like seven. 

00:13:50
ASHLEY Busy, busy. And this was on the weekends, too? 

00:13:55
KELSEY Um, yeah, except it wasn't that bad, because I didn't have school. We had practice in the morning. 

00:14:00
ASHLEY Yeah, and then you spend a lotta time doing homework and stuff. That's a lotta time, what did you get free time, did you do anything with like friends and extrac-, other extracurricular activities? 

00:14:10
KELSEY On the weekends, but not really during basketball season, that was mainly what I did. 

00:14:10
ASHLEY Yeah, I can understand that, seems like a lotta, a lotta that time again was spent with basketball. Was that uh, your only sport you played this last year? 

00:14:20
KELSEY Um, I did track in the spring. 

00:14:25
ASHLEY Mhmm, out of the two sports, what was, what was your focus? 

00:14:25
KELSEY Um, my focus was mainly on basketball. Track was mainly just to stay in shape and do something, because I needed something to do. 

00:14:35
ASHLEY Yeah, so, with basketball, I mean, there's gotta be a lot of, a lot of time spent, a lot of, lotta things goin on there with team dynamics and trying to, you know, make it to, to leagues, and on DCS every year. Tell me what that was like for you. 

00:14:50
KELSEY Um, well, our school, it traditionally really good. And competitive. And so, it was pretty intense and everyone's really focused on basketball, and some people were only focused on basketball, so, that was kind of tough, because I'm doing like IB, so one of my main focuses was school, and I didnt have as much time. So, to kind of balance the two. And, because a lot of my classmates in IB were only focused on academics and then my teammates were only focused on basketball. 

00:15:25
ASHLEY So you were having to do both. 

00:15:25
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:15:25
"Emotional Focus" 

00:15:25
ASHLEY So how was it trying to balance out the pressures from even from your teammates and your classmates? Where you, if you're playing the basketball team, you needed to focus on basketball, when you're in class you need to focus on school, how was, how was balancing out those different dynamics? 

00:15:40
KELSEY Um, it could be tough at times. Um, my coach was pretty understanding, like, um, when we had exams, I told him I had to miss practice, and he'd let me because, he wasn't, an exam you can't make up. 

00:16:00
ASHLEY So he understood, he understood as the academics were just as important to you. 

00:16:05
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:16:05
ASHLEY What about, what about your teammates, I know how important teammates are to, to you as an athlete and to other athletes and how well team dynamics, you know, can make or break a team, do, was that, did that have any um, you know problems with the team? Did they ever get on your back for that? 

00:16:20
KELSEY Um, not really. They were pretty good about it. 

00:16:25
ASHLEY Yeah, so they were pretty understanding of what your focus was. Good, good. So, did you have, um, we never really talked about this before, do you have, do you have siblings? 

00:16:35
KELSEY Yes, I have a sister who's 15 and a brother who's 12. 

00:16:40
ASHLEY Oh, so how are they feeling now you're about to leave? Have you talked to them about it? 

00:16:45
KELSEY Um, kind of, I think my sister's kind of sad, because we're, we're close, but I'm not going to be too far. And my brother, I think is excited because he gets my room. 

00:17:00
ASHLEY Yeah, gets to move on up. So um, does your sister, does she play sports as well? 

00:17:05
KELSEY Um, no, before high school she played um, she didn't play, she swam competitively, and since she got into high school, she's been really into drama. 

00:17:15
ASHLEY Okay, so you guys have had your, you know, different, um, focuses, while you've been in high school, so you've been able to focus in on academics and sports and she's been able to focus in on drama. Is she as high academic student as you are? 

00:17:30
KELSEY Um, yeah, she is also going to do IB. 

00:17:30
ASHLEY Oh she is, okay, so she under-, she maybe understands the pressures, learn the pressures from you a little bit. You've kinda mapped out a road for her. 

00:17:40
KELSEY Time management. 

00:17:40
ASHLEY Yes, time management. Now tell me more about time management, that had to have been a huge thing for you, over the last four, you know not even last year, but over the four years, like what is time management to you? 

00:17:50
KELSEY Um, well I kind of a fidgety person, so I like to always be doing stuff. And um, just having like a schedule keeps me on track, and I found like I do better, like academically when I have a sport, it, I don't know, it just kind of keeps me um, rolling, I guess. 

00:18:15
ASHLEY I can understand that, kind of keeps you in that routine of you do this, then you gotta move on to that, and, so how's it gonna be different for you next year not playing? 

00:18:20
"Emotional Focus" 

00:18:20
KELSEY Um, I'm kinda worried about that- 

00:18:25
ASHLEY Oh yeah, are you? 

00:18:25
KELSEY Yeah, I'll have to find something um, to fill my time up. But I'm not sure it'll be as intense as basketball was so far. 

00:18:40
ASHLEY So, I can see that, I mean I saw it on your face, I know you're smiling, but you can see it in your eyes that it is quite a concern for you. 

00:18:45
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:18:45
"Future Focus" 

00:18:50
ASHLEY So have you thought about maybe some other ways that you can-, that you're gonna maybe move on with this routine and how we can, how you can adjust it? Going forward? 

00:19:00
KELSEY Um, yeah, I think I'm gonna join some clubs, hopefully. 

00:19:00
ASHLEY Oh good, okay. Like what kinda clubs? 

00:19:05
KELSEY Um, there's this thing called the Axe Committee at Stanford, and it's like a spirit club, and they're the ones that run out in front of the football team carrying the flag, and stuff like that. 

00:19:15
ASHLEY Oh fun, how'd you get involved in that? 

00:19:20
KELSEY Um, I just E-mailed the, he's a junior in charge and I kind of bugged him, and so, I think he'll let me in now. 

00:19:25
ASHLEY So how much time do you think that'll take up for you? 

00:19:25
KELSEY Really not sure. I don't know how big a commitment, I mean, the clubs are, so I'll have to see. 

00:19:35
ASHLEY Yeah, have you thought about how, um, how long have you been an athlete? How-, have you been playing sports since you were younger? 

00:19:40
KELSEY Um, yeah, I started basketball in third grade, and softball so I was probably about seven. 

00:19:45
"Emotional Focus" 

00:19:50
ASHLEY Oh yeah, so have you thought about how that's gonna change too, maybe letting go of some of that competitiveness? 

00:19:55
KELSEY Yeah. Um, it's gonna be tough, because it's always been a part of my life, and being competitive, and so now, um, I'll probably, I'll probably try to play intramurals at Stanford, but it won't be as like, big a deal. 

00:20:10
ASHLEY Yeah. So is that part of the letting go within the- 

00:20:10
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:20:15
ASHLEY -is realizing that competitive Kelsey is maybe having to say goodbye and close that chapter. So yeah it's not always, it's not always the easiest thing. But you know sometimes we have to close one door to open up another, so, so intramurals will take some of your time, hopefully, if you get involved with that, and then, um, the Axe Committee, um, have you thought about what you're gonna be studying next year? 

00:20:35
"Planning For Transition" 

00:20:40
KELSEY Um, not really, we can be undecided until um, the end of sophomore year, but I was leaning toward international relations, maybe. 

00:20:45
ASHLEY Oh, great. So even so, I mean, I know the IB program is very intense, and there's a lot of academic pressures, um, Stanford, as you know, we know, is a very well known school with a, a, again, high academic standard, so, do you think there'll be much difference in, in academics, do you think that'll take up more of your time? 

00:21:10
KELSEY Um, probably. I really have no idea. I'll have to ask people. 

00:21:15
ASHLEY Have you, do you know anyone who goes to school there? 

00:21:15
KELSEY Um, one of my friends' older sister is going to be a senior next year- 

00:21:20
ASHLEY At Stanford? 

00:21:20
KELSEY Yeah, so I can probably talk to her. 

00:21:25
"Realistic Focus" 

00:21:25
ASHLEY Mmhmm, maybe talk about the difference between high school and, and college itself and um, maybe the, having talk about what's different between the two alone, just dealing with extracurriculars, I'm sure high school extracurriculars are different from college extracurriculars, they change, even from school to school. So, um, you know, tell me, um, how's, how's your family doing? We talked about your siblings, but how, how're your, your parents doing with you? Getting ready to move on? 

00:21:55
KELSEY Um, I think they're pretty good. They're very happy I'm not on the east coast. 

00:22:00
ASHLEY Were you looking at the east coast? 

00:22:00
KELSEY Yeah, so they thought I'd be um, like a five hour plane ride away. 

00:22:05
ASHLEY Right, and were you ever looking at playing sports, uh, in college? 

00:22:10
KELSEY Um, yeah, I was um, at like the Ivy leagues, their um, bar's a little lower for- 

00:22:20
ASHLEY For sports? 

00:22:20
KELSEY Yeah, and, at some, at the university of Chicago, which is, I have an acdemic school and their division three, so I made like a recruiting video, for that- 

00:22:30
ASHLEY Now tell me how, tell me about that and how you did that. 

00:22:30
KELSEY Um, well my mom has a friend who does videos and so, we just went to a gym one morning and um, I just did drills and shooting and stuff, and he filmed it and then he edited it together. 

00:22:45
ASHLEY Now, was that your decision to do that? Or was that maybe some influence of your coach or your parents? 

00:22:50
KELSEY It was mostly mine, because I thought like, I, doing athletics could help me get into those schools, and um, my mom helped me with it. 

00:23:00
ASHLEY Mmhmm, so she was, she was supportive, throughout the-, throughout the way, and she's supportive in, in, in Stanford and decision and maybe not to play basketball? 

00:23:10
KELSEY Yeah, they want me to play intramurals. But I think, we all know I won't be able to play on the varsity team. 

00:23:15
ASHLEY Right, now what if you weren't able to play intramurals, let's say school took up too much time? How, how do you think that would play out? Even for you, or even your family? 

00:23:25
KELSEY Um, I think they'd probably be a little disappointed, 'cuz they miss watching us play, and like my sister swims, she doesn't do that anymore. But, um, overall, they'd let me do what I had to do. 

00:23:40
ASHLEY But you think that maybe at first they'd feel disappointed? 

00:23:45
KELSEY Um, kind of a little sad, it's, like officially over, like. 

00:23:45
"Emotional Focus" 

00:23:45
ASHLEY Yeah? Now how do you feel? 

00:23:50
KELSEY Um, I'd probably be a little sad, too. 

00:23:50
ASHLEY Letting go. 

00:23:50
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:23:55
ASHLEY Time to maybe look at the dream, in a way. Oh, you know what, that's a hard time, letting go, being an athlete um, especially in your senior year, knowing you're not gonna move on, and closing that out. It's, it's a difficult chapter to close, I mean, you spent, I mean, how many hours in the gym or on the track and with all that your teammates, and, it's like saying goodbye to a whole new world. Or you know, saying hello to a new world. Saying goodbye to a world you're really familiar with. So um, during school, um, was, with the IB program, was, how supportive were your parents with you doing the, the IB program? 

00:24:30
KELSEY Um, they were really supportive of that. And, um, I don't know, I just really wanted to do it. 

00:24:40
ASHLEY So what was, what do you think um, if, if I were to ask your parents, or I was to ask your mom, what do you think, if I was to ask, what was your focus during school, would she say basketball? Or would she say academics? 

00:24:55
KELSEY Um, my focus? 

00:24:55
ASHLEY No, if I was ask-, yeah, your focus, if I was to ask your parents. 

00:25:00
KELSEY Um, she'd probably say Academics. Yeah. 

00:25:05
ASHLEY Mmhmm, do you think that's really the-, that's how they feel? Do you ever think that sometimes maybe their focus was, like they really wanted you to play sports, but they never wanted to, you know, put that pressure on you? 

00:25:15
KELSEY Um, yeah, I could tell like, we're a very sports-oriented family, and, so like, they really enjoyed going to the games, it's a lot of fun for them, and um, like for academics you can't really go and watch me write an essay, so, um, I just think they enjoyed the athletics part. 

00:25:35
ASHLEY You feel like kinda maybe it was a, a family thing you guys could do together, and be involved with together. And now maybe they're gonna have to let go of that, because they're not gonna have that school anymore. So you're a litte-, are you a little bit worried about how, you know, this transition's gonna be next year? 

00:25:50
KELSEY Um, yeah, I think it's always kind of rough going from high school to college. And, um, like, I won't be able to do exactly the same thing, so. Be a little flexible, I guess. 

00:26:05
"Planning For Transition" 

00:26:05
ASHLEY Yeah, so, um, what's kinda your, your, your goal for next year, if you had to think of something? 

00:26:10
KELSEY Um, probably the, do well in my classes, and maybe find my niche, I think, in school, and like, do some activities, because I like to be involved in stuff. 

00:26:25
ASHLEY So it sounds like you're maybe moving from what you're familiar with in high school, to trying to find the same familiarity at, in college. 

00:26:35
KELSEY Yeah. 

00:26:35
ASHLEY Well what happens if you can't find that familiarity? 

00:26:40
KELSEY Um, well, I don't think I'll be able to find, like exactly what I did, so I'll just um, kind of move on to new things. 

00:26:45
ASHLEY Mmhmm, are you excited about that, or does it make you a little, how does that make you feel? 

00:26:50
KELSEY Um, mainly I'm excited. Kind of nervous. 

00:26:55
ASHLEY Good, good. But nervous is an okay feeling. I mean you, any person who's starting something new has, has nerves and college is, is a whole new step, so many exciting things to do. Um, but also that sense of, it's again, without the sports it's a, it's a world you're not used to. So um, how do you think, um, your time's gonna be completely different from high school to college, like how are, how is that gonna play out? 

00:27:25
KELSEY Um, it will be completely different, because, I think the classes are like, on random days, and at random times, so it's not like you go at eight and leave at three. 

00:27:40
ASHLEY Yeah, so that routine sounds like it's not gonna be a daily routine, it's maybe gonna be a weekly routine? 

00:27:45
KELSEY Mmhmm, yeah, so probably, um, I'm thinking I'll run maybe in the morning, or- 

00:27:50
ASHLEY Hm, so you like to stay in shape, too. 

00:27:55
KELSEY Yeah, I think it helps me, like the stress of academics. 

00:27:55
"Reframe Data As Strengths" 

00:27:55
ASHLEY I think that what you're saying right there is a great thing to a lotta athletes, learn from sports as it's a great release to take stress away by you know, just getting away for a moment, and they, you know, exercise, it does boost your energy, and clear out the head, and so that you recognizing that, that's a good thing for you. And will be a positive thing as you move forward, I think maintaining that will be really important, um, if you can make again time for it. So, it's good, I mean, it sounds like you've already, although you're kind of nervous about next year's routine, you are already kind of thinking about how you're gonna adapt with that routine. So kind of make time for, make time for run, what else you gonna maybe do for fun, or do you- 

00:28:40
KELSEY Um, I'd like to go to a lot, I mean, most of the games, like football and women's basketball. And, um, like hang out with my friends. And maybe go around pow-wow too. Just explore. 

00:28:55
ASHLEY Yeah, I think that'll be different for you too because it sounds like you didn't have a lot of that free time, before. 

00:29:05
KELSEY Yeah, didn't have a lot of time to just do whatever. 

00:29:10
ASHLEY So it sounds like there's also a battle here between freedom now, from letting go of sports, and then also, you know, more time in how we're gonna manage that when it's just the change in that routine. 

00:29:20
KELSEY Yeah, um, I'll have to kind of stay on top of myself, because mainly, um, in high school if I had like too much free time, I kind of procrastinate, yeah. 

00:29:30
ASHLEY Really? So, is that something that maybe you kind of spark some, you know, just like a light in your head, like oh my gos, I don't wanna get, I don't wanna be that person again. 

00:29:40
KELSEY Yeah, I like to stay on top of things. 

00:29:45
ASHLEY So what were, what would happen to you when you say you procrastinated on an essay or something like, what, what would be the worst that could happen? 

00:29:50
KELSEY Um, I'd probably have to do it really late at night. Or early in the morning. Yeah, and so, like, part of the reason I, like, couldn't let myself do that is because of like, if we had a basketball game the next day, I would really not be good. 

00:30:05
ASHLEY So it sounds like really sports have helped you maintain this good academic track, and now it's almost next year, what's gonna fill that time, so you can keep maintaining that, the academic excellency you've, I still am just beyond impressed that you're able to have an IB diploma, didn't you say you have the diploma? I mean, that is an achievement in its own, not only are you, you know, a great athlete, and you were captain of the team, of the basketball team? I just, I hope that, um, I'm sure your parents have said that enough, I just think that's amazing that you were able to handle all that. And come out with, you know, such a strong head on your shoulders, and you know be so excited and also be so well grounded, um, to what you know, you need to do for next year, and undrstanding-, you sounds like you really, as young as you are, you really understand yourself. And understand what you need. 

00:31:00
KELSEY Thanks. 

00:31:00
"Future Focus" 

00:31:00
ASHLEY Of course, so, if I were to see you in four years, where will you be? 

00:31:05
KELSEY Um, hopefully I've graduated, um, probably maybe looking for a grad school, or, um, hopefully get a job maybe. Because I don't know, the economy. Hopefully. 

00:31:25
ASHLEY Well Kelsey, I wanna say it's been so, it's been so nice having you here, and um, I think what you've learned through, through school, and through sports, um, again, it sounds like you've got a strong head on your shoulders and really are aware of the challenges you're gonna face. Um, which is so rare for not only, uh, somebody going off to college, but an athlete like yourself and I think just checking back in, um, with your future counselor, um, find out who that is when you get to Stanford and maintaining that, so if there are maybe some times where you do find yourself the routines just not the same, that you can check in with them and maybe work on those time management skills again. Sounds like, you know, you and I have done really well, throughout the years, um, talking about those so we know um, you know how to check up on that, but, I, you know, I hope you maintain a relationship like we've had, also with your future counselor, um, they'll be there as well, so, if not, you know, be more important as, you know, we move on, so, um, I was thining about maybe just touching base with your mom, um, just seeing how she's doing, will that be okay with you? Okay, so I was thinking maybe um, you know, I'll get her in, um, here as soon as possible and we'll just catch up and, maybe if you and I have a chance with her to sit down and just see how things are goin, we'll see what goes from there. So, the best of luck to you. 

00:32:45
KELSEY All right. Thank you. 

00:32:45
ASHLEY I really hope things go well, so. Congrats again. 

00:32:45
KELSEY Thanks. 

00:32:50
ASHLEY You're welcome. 

00:32:50
Parent Consultation of Transitioning Athlete 

00:32:55
ASHLEY Lisa, thank you so much for coming in, um, I had Kelsey in here, actually just earlier and we were kinda just talking about what she's gonna be doing next year, and sounds like she's off to some pretty exciting things next year. How're you feeling about that? 

00:33:10
LISA Um, I feel good because she was interested in schools on the east coast, and the midwest so, it was a relief to have her closer to home. And, you know, knowing that we'll see her more often, and we can be more support for her. 

00:33:20
ASHLEY Yeah, she sounds, she, when we were talking, she said you guys, your family had very, something tells me you're very close, and you're very supportive of each other. 

00:33:30
LISA Yeah, even the extended family, grandparents a lot of family support, so, I think that's really helped her, and I think that helped her decision to do, that when she go into Stanford, that it was a relief for her to know that she'd see family and have that support. 

00:33:45
ASHLEY Well good, so, uh, she's talked a little bit also too, I know she's, not only she's a great student, she's a good athlete too. We talked about kind of saying goodbye to that, you know, how is that gonna be saying goodbye to that for you, I mean no more games, and sounds like the other siblings aren't involved as much. 

00:34:00
LISA Right, yeah, and we've talked about those withdrawals, and we do have close friends that she made through sports so we said you know we'll still go to some games next year for her high school and having a daughter that is a junior there. Um, you know, so we still have the connection at the school so I think that will help. 

00:34:15
ASHLEY Yeah, um, we didn't get-, I didn't get to talk to it much about Kelsey, but I'd be interested to hear about it from you. Um, she talked a little bit about her teammates, but won't really get into it, moreso, some teammates were more focused on basketball, but um, how did you see that play out with the dynamic of her verses her teammates and what pressure she was under to perform basketball, you know, perform as an athlete, was that hard to watch? Sometimes? 

00:34:45
LISA You know, it was sometimes because you saw the students um had a varied interest in basketball, some of them on the weekends would be, out playing, or they'd seek out that extra bit of help which I think in her younger years, since you know she started playing young, she would go to basketball camps in the summer and really work on her game, and towards the end, you know, her last couple years when it was clear to her, and I think it became evident to us, that she wasn't gonna continue on, that she wasn't putting in that extra effort, but her friends were, and then there were maybe a little bit of pressure from the other athletes on her, too, you know, work on her game. But, um, I think she had a pretty good sense of that wasn't for her and she had other interests. 

00:35:35
ASHLEY Yeah, I think what's so wonderful about Kesley is, and rare, too, to see as an athlete as how well she's adapted with, you know, being a good athlete, being captain of a team, holding onto that pressure, and also doing so well with the IB program. Um, I just hope you guys know she's a, an exceptional student, so you should be, I'm sure you guys are very proud. 

00:35:50
"Reframe Data As Strengths 

00:35:55
LISA Yeah, we really are, and she's worked very hard, she gave up a lot in her earlier years, of, um, you know with the dedication to basketball which took a lotta time, and then to her studies, I think we would be like, you know, it's Friday night and we would go to the basketball game, don't you wanna go, and she's like, no I'm gonna work on this or that, so to see the things that she gave up, but then her last semester, after basketball, her senior year, we really saw her have a really good time and we were happy that she, we can see that she can do that as well. 

00:36:25
"Positive Asset Search" 

00:36:25
ASHLEY So where'd she get that inner drive from, is that something that she's always done, or she kinda learn that from someone in the family? 

00:36:35
LISA You know, I think, quite frankly some of it came easy, which was harder for me to see, because I was not a good student, and you know, the teachers would come to us and say you know you have a really bright child, and a lotta times especially when they're younger you think, you know, thank you, but, you probably say that to all the parents. And so, it became evident I think when she was in third grade and they had the testing for GATE and they had a letter that said she qualified and we had no idea what that meant. And went to a meeting at the time they had funding for that, so they explained to us a little bit more on what that meant, and then we started understanding you know, what that meant, and how to support her in her efforts at school. But, um, you know, that's, kinda been who's she been. 

00:37:20
ASHLEY So it kinda sounds somewhat different from maybe how you grew up, would you say that's right? 

00:37:25
LISA Oh for sure, yeah, and one of our expectations, or one of our fears, because she's never had a B, and it's gonna be hard for her going to college and I think that's one of, you know, our my concerns for her for next year is, we were hoping in high school actually that she would have gotten a B in a, on a report card, she'd gotten B's on tests. 

00:37:45
"Planning For Transition" 

00:37:45
ASHLEY What do you think will happen if let's just say she was in college and get a B, what do you think will happen? 

00:37:50
LISA Um, well I'm hoping that she takes in in stride, and I really think, given her easy going personality, I think she will. Um, so I'm just hoping it, she doesn't, it's not hard on her, yet she does share it with us that, oh, I got a B, and that's okay, so. Her sister did, her sister got her first B, and so I think she's, knows what our response to that was, like okay, it's all right. You know, it's good. And then for Kiley (ph) as a junior getting to be, she knows that Kelsey's friends who had Bs got into good schools and, and have that too, and so I think Kelsey in seeing that, in her sister, that it was okay. I'm hoping she'll think back on that. And be like it's okay. 

00:38:35
ASHLEY Do you think you'll be a little bit shocked if something like that happens, or? More relieved? 

00:38:35
LISA I think we'll be more relieved. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:38:40
ASHLEY Has school and sports has it always been easy for her? 

00:38:45
LISA Uh, you know we see the time that she puts in, so I don't know that it's been easy for her, she puts in the effort and she really wants to do well and gets that success. 

00:38:55
ASHLEY Yeah, maybe easy isn't the best word, but maybe just success, has always been, successful at what she does. 

00:39:00
"Metaphor" 

00:39:00
LISA Yeah, almost to the point where like she's lucky too, and when we put names in raffles, we kind of joke about it as a family, if we're gonna put in a for a raffle, we put her name on the raffle ticket, and then she did win something from the little raffle and they called and said can I speak with Kelsey and Kelsey answered the phone and she said I entered what raffle? And it's like well you're lucky, you know, so, um, yeah I think she's got some humbling stuff and I think that'll determine how she ends up based on how she deals with it. 

00:39:30
ASHLEY Yeah, yeah, has there ever been a time though that she hasn't maybe succeeded at something and, or is that still, is something she still has to to face? 

00:39:35
LISA You know that was what, we felt like sports was good for her, because you don't win every game, and so fer to face those, um, defeats, she has had that, so we talk about the success at school, and the success in basketball being the captain, but you know, they lost big games, and she had to feel that, so I think that's what sports brings. Those life lessons that are really valuable. 

00:40:00
ASHLEY Mhmm, and did you? Were you an athlete too? 

00:40:05
LISA I played basketball and volleyball in college, but it was a very small college, so we didn't win too many games. Yeah, so. 

00:40:10
"Emotional Focus" 

00:40:10
ASHLEY Did you ever have this kinda vision that maybe you, your daughter would go on and do the same thing even if you know, I know she's going to Stanford, but did you ever have that dream that maybe she would do the, go on the same path that you did? 

00:40:25
LISA Yeah, and be more successful than I was. Which she was, which is good, you know, you really get that as a parent, you can, you know, feel the, the pride, you know, and it would be interesting, I would, um, text friends, a particular friend, and we would text and say, you know, how's the team doing, and I always say we're winning, and then later I reflected on that, and it's like, I'm not on the floor, but as a parent you really get that feeling, and I think that's what, when it does get outta hand, with parents, you get that feeling that for some reason, that's you on the floor, or you know, that's your success. You know, or your defeat. And you reflect on that, so. 

00:41:00
ASHLEY Well it sounds like you've had your um, chance at that, where you've been an athlete, so you've been able to experience that, so you're not doing that through Kelsey now. 

00:41:10
LISA Right, I'd like to think that. But then when I did send those text, it's like you know, we, it's not me, yeah. 

00:41:15
ASHLEY Well you just feel so part of the team. 

00:41:15
LISA Right, yeah, you do. Yeah. 

00:41:15
ASHLEY So um, she also kinda just talked about just her routine, how that's gonna be different for her. Um, sounds like she was from, when she woke up to when she was going to bed, she was dead-se-, you know, start the routine now, did you guys have any influence on that, or was that all her again? 

00:41:35
LISA Um, I think a lotta that was her drive. And, what she knew she had to do to succeed and putting that pressures on her self. We were the ones saying, you know, why don't you go to the football games, you know, take a break, but she just had that inner drive, and the structure in her day- 

00:41:50
ASHLEY I know, it's, again, I'm thinking about the time she spent between the IB program, you know, sports, um, just you know, the, the community service from the IB program, all her extracurriculars, did she make a lotta time for, to be social? 

00:42:05
LISA You know, not as much as we would have liked, so, um, but then again, after it was done, when she had decided she was gonna go to Stanford, her last semester after that was done, she really had fun, and it was nice to see that. And that she had developed those friendships that perhaps we thought the reason we wanted her to go was to develop those friendships, she really had, and she had some really good friends, and has some real good friends, and we'd go to the movies and they did have some pick up basketball games, just for fun, and she really enjoyed that. 

00:42:35
ASHLEY Oh, good, so she was really able to let her hair down. So it's not like she'll be heading off to school and, you know, really letting her hair down. Do you have any fears of that? 

00:42:45
LISA Yeah, I did up until like again, those last couple months of school, when I saw her go to parties and I knew they were drinking, so I knew she was experiencing that, and you know she would talk about, you know, smoking pot, and you know it's almost like I felt good, like, okay, and she said, you know, I was the designated driver, and I'm okay with that, and I was like, that's okay, because you know I've been to college, I went to a four year school, I know what's gonna happen her freshman year, and you know, just knowing that we raised a daughter that's going to make the right decisions and you know, yeah. 

00:43:15
ASHLEY Yeah, exactly so she's not going there on, let's, I mean, we all don't want our, you know, kids and students, we dont' want them going out there and getting wasted and drinking every weekend, but gotta be realistic, when kids are on their own, they're gonna experiment, and we just hope they do it safe and responsibly, and that we've led them on the right way. So how's it gonna be for you guys at home without her just at home even? Have you kinda talked about that? 

00:43:40
LISA Yeah, yeah, and then she went away for six months, or six weeks to uh, Morroco, and so we thought that would be a really good experience for us and for her to get an idea how that would be. So, um, we had a big stir, we did miss her, and um, again knowing how close she's gonna be really makes a difference for us. Knowing that we can see her when we want to and she can come home and um, she's gonna turn 18 in October, so we're gonna like oh, your birthday's on a Friday, and you know we'll get to see you on your birthday, and she said, yeah, maybe not, and we were like what? It was so, yeah, but yeah knowing again, that you know, we will see her, that's gonna be, but you know it will be a different dynamic only having two kids at home, and, and um, yeah. And the driving thing. She's the only one that drives, so it's nice to say, oh, well, see, will you take your sister to the movies, or- 

00:44:35
ASHLEY A lotta life adjustments. 

00:44:35
LISA Yeah. 

00:44:35
ASHLEY Now do the other, uh, we talked a little bit with Kesley, but your other two children, they don't play sports? So it's kind of also saying goodbye, not only Kelsey, she gets to say goodbye to sports, but like you said, you're gonna go back to the games, but, it's gotta be almost letting go of a, another realm for you, too. 

00:44:55
LISA Yeah, and it, again, it was one of the reasons we really liked sports, was that the life lessons that they teach, that we're trying to figure out especially with my son, who doesn't really have any interests, how is he gonna get that through another avenue. You know, my daughter has drama, the other one does drama, and so she's learning, you know, cooperation and the life skills that she's gonna get from that, performing and, um, going through, and they cut you know, you either get a part or you don't, or you get a big part, so she's learning that. So, um, it is different for us to think about how the kids are gonna get the opportunities. 

00:45:30
ASHLEY When do you think Kelsey learned? 

00:45:30
LISA You know one of the big things that surprised us was her eigth grade graduation. They had the opportunity to give speeches. And, Kelsey, you know, she's not, you saw that, you know, she's not that boistrous, you know, but she said I'm gonna give a speech, and I was like really? And she said yeah, and then I thought wow you're gonna stand up in front of those people? And there were a lotta people at her graduation, and she said yeah, and then I thought yeah of course because you've been in front of a crowd and shot a free throw that made a difference in a game. And you've been performing in front of people for a while now since you were in third grade or you know, earlier, softball I think she started when she was you know, probably first grade, so I thought you know again, those are those things that we really, she learned through sports and she did a great job for eighth grade and you know gave the speech and and didnt seem nervous, yeah, so, yeah. 

00:46:25
ASHLEY So sounds like confidence and there's the ability to know that even if she does, she didn't succeed, and fail at the same time, but it's still a success. I think that's gonna, I think it's really a-, you know, amazing that she got all that, and you're able to take all that, especially now that she's going away to college and, and moving on. 

00:46:45
LISA Right, yeah, yeah. 

00:46:50
ASHLEY Just a very, you know, amazing time right now for her. I think it's exciting. So, you know, I, you know you've talked about just still, earlier that you were just a little bit nervous to see how she's gonna handle uh, and live out the pressure. 

00:47:00
LISA We have a saying when the kids go, like their first day of school or whatever, it's just like, make good choices. And, and it was interesting because my daughter started school last wee and my son said to her when she left, make good choices. So it was really cute that again those things that you don't know you're affecting your kids, but it, he knew, you know, make good choices, so, that's kind of our motto, for her, and it's like okay, when you're at that party, make good choices, and yeah. 

00:47:30
ASHLEY Well it sounds like you haven't really had a point to where she hasn't, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of uh, faith in her, and a lotta trust in her because you've given her this opportunity to fail, but she's picked herself back up, so it sounds as though maybe you are a little afraid, sometimes it sounds like you're actually pretty confident in her going to school 

00:47:50
LISA Yeah, I think, and we've talked to her other parents who are, you know, letting go these ages, and there have been the times when she's ready to go. She really is, you know, she does something that maybe we don't agree with, but like the trip to Morocco, we were really apprehensive about that. You know, sending her to another country, with what's going on in the world today. And our first reaction was, no you can't go. And then we said well, you know, she's gonna be eighteen, she's gonna be able to do it, so we need to support her in that, and let her go. So. 

00:48:20
ASHLEY Just amazing what sports can bring, I mean it's not always, it's not always advertised to families when they're thinking about YMCA or CYO at such a young age, they draw on the character, you know, the things you can work on from such young ages that are so hard to teach in school and it sounds like you guys have really taken the lessons outta that and so thankful because it's helping Kelsey, you know, grow as a woman, and grow as a athlete, excuse me, as a student, and just really help her in her future here, so. Well, I have to say again, Kelsey's just been amazing here. I think a congratulations to you as well, you guys deserve a congratulations. I just again, find it so amazing that she's made it, you know, the whole way through with just, again, it's such a strong head on her shoulders. So yeah, and, um, I'd love to get her back in here maybe the three of us can maybe just talk about what, you know, what would we do um, if some, if she were to maybe lose track. You know, let's just say, you know, she goes on a wild hair, you know, sounds like you guys haven't gone through that, so maybe just how, as a family, you guys would work through that, and I was telling Kelsey too, we had such an amazing relationship, the two of us, um, I would encourage you guys to continue that with her college counselor, um, you know, again it's a bigger school, hopefully though, when she maybe picks a department, um, maybe even within a department having someone to guide her or even advise her. Um, the more people to involve her there, she'll have a great experience. So. 

00:49:45
LISA Yeah, that's good, I didn't even think about that, you know, like, the support system there at the college that you know, would be helpful for her. 

00:49:55
ASHLEY Yeah and again it's, it's you know it's it's like starting over as much as she's familiar, it's starting over and, the more people you know to have to just like, you know, in sports she had her coach, she had her teammates, she's used to kind of you know going to a lot of people, with, with family members and again moving on to college if she can think of it in the same way, with a, you know, her dorm RA, um, you know whether she gets involved and she was talking about the AXE committee, you know that could be a new buddy of hers, just to go to if, you know, just almost these lifelines. Athletes are used to lifelines, and the more she can create that for Stanford, I'm sure she'll do really, really well. So. 

00:50:30
LISA Yeah, that's really true, I, didn't think about that. About how, you know, she's really gonna need that, you know. Support and who those people are gonna be for her. 

00:50:35
ASHLEY Yeah, it's like creating that same environment, because she talked about that routine, well some of that routine, and now that I think about it, wish we would have talked about it with her, is not only in her daily routine, but just her atmosphere. What's familar to her. Yeah, experience something new, but put yourself where you know you succeed too. So, but I, I had a great, you know, it was good, and again, nice to meet you and thank you for sharing so much about your family, and again, congratulations, you guys just have a, an amazing daughter, and you know best of luck to you and your other two students, so, um, maybe we can get Kelsey in and maybe we can follow up just the three of us and just check in to see how things are goin. Okay? Thanks so much. 

00:51:15
Debriefing of Transitioning Student Athlete Role-Play 

00:51:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, well uh, thank you both for, you know, participating in the role play, I think, uh, in this segment we will, uh, reflect, on, uh, what we uh, got out of it. Um, let me, uh, I guess just pose this uh, to the two of you, and I guess we can start with you, Ashley, as counselor, what were the highlights of the session, what, uh, jumped out, uh, in terms of, uh, um, working with, uh, both Kelsey and with Lisa? 

00:51:40
ASHLEY Well it's interesting. Um, I felt focused um, between Kelsey and Lisa, the focuses were a little different, um, which was also nice, um, I felt with Kelsey, we, as much as I wanted to focus in on that athlete side, um, you could see, academics were her focus, so we focused in on that and the pressures of how is she gonna maintain her routine like she did in high school with the pressures of being an athlete, being a good student, how is she gonna carry that over to school. Uh, with Lisa it was similar, but um, it was more athletically focused in seeing that she was leaving that behind, and also how was she going to, what has she taken from athletics, and how is she going to really use what she's learned and make it her focus at school and, what if she fails, what happens, and will my daughter, you know, succeed like she's been succeeding, so. 

00:52:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, so I'm sensing a theme about transition being a main topic and um, things to expect as a result of uh, taking the next uh, transition into, uh, college and, uh, the expectations to be addressed as a result of that. And it also sounds like, uh, in this particular case, uh, you know, Kelsey is accustomed to a lot of success and a lot of uh, things that have come her way both athletically and academically and uh, perhaps I guess with that, her expectations or, um, expectations that perhaps ease us both in and out of school, uh, is that a fair, uh, um, assessment to wha we're bringing up? So uh, Lisa, in terms of, uh, what you got out of this experience in role play, uh, what would be the highlights for you as a, as a parent and as also somebody that, uh, I guess uh, did focus, uh, a fair amount on the athletic side? 

00:53:25
LISA Um, I think that the main thing that I thought was helpful for me was when Ashley brought up the information about that transition and her support system and what that's gonna look like when she gets to collge, and having been that support system for her, how is that gonna be for her, where is that support system gonna be, being that she's not um, participating in athletics and she doesn't have a coach and she doesn't have the teammates that she's falling right into. So, I think that was a, uh, a really good question that Ashley asked me is, you know how do you see that playing an important role and who will those people be, and helping me see that. 

00:53:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah and I, I believe one of the uh, uh, things that we focus on for resources for that, and I know it might have been discussed uh, in, in the session itself, uh, the use of the advisors, or, other uh, stakeholders to provide that transitional work, um, and how do you see that, uh, often playing out, is that typical type of strategy that counselors and other stakeholders would use? 

00:54:20
LISA Well I think it's, well, you do what's best and what, how have you succeeded in the past, looking up what's worked for you, and it sounds like what has worked for Kelsey is really um, using a lot of support, not with only her family, but again with teammates, coaches, her teachers, um, it sounds like she draws from everyone, so, well, I talked about with, uh, with Lisa is kinda not only we mimicking the routine, we want to also be really helpful for Kelsey to mimic her atmosphere, her enviornment, which is again involving a lot of those um, the stakeholders, so, um, collge being a new atmosphere it's kind of, it's you know, kind of look to see where those are gonna be, so maybe with an RA, you know she talked about uh, a committee she was gonna be on, maybe reaching out to the head of that committee, just finding different ways, using the same tactics, but finding just a different way to do it. So. 

00:55:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Would that be a similar strategy that you're familiar with in terms of um, you know, as a parent and in terms of one who also is familiar with teaching? 

00:55:20
LISA Yeah, I can see, in some ways, like she's already began reaching out through social networking, the kids are really interacting already, which I think will be helpful for her, when she meets kids to say, oh yeah, I know you from this, or getting on the, you know, the AXE committee, she's gotten herself onto already, you know, to go to a football game before school even starts, and she'll be making those connections. 

00:55:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent, uh, and in terms too I guess of theory, uh, actually I guess, uh, maybe we should talk about this so the audience can understand, um, tell them about your approach and, and the way you phrase things and do things a certain way. 

00:55:55
ASHLEY Sure, um, I was, I used to be an athlete as well, so talking with Kelsey you know, I didn't wanna get too much into it, because I don't wanna spark too much personal story, but I do relate to Kelsey's story. Um, and so knowing how I felt going through that, um, you know just being more solution-focused. Um, athletes very much want just like winning a game, get to the end, wanna get to the goal, and um, using that theoretical background, asking scaling questions, exception questions, um, they can, I feel, they can more relate to that. Versus maybe getting more deeper um, you know, really wanting to be again more goal, goal oriented, so. 

00:56:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, uh, when you say, uh, uh, it uh, it gets as your good approach because it's uh, ability to go with the appropriate level of depth. I mean, um, can you give more voice to that, can you describe that a little bit more? About how it manages to do that without it being- 

00:56:50
ASHLEY Right, I think athletes are, from what I've expressed, experienced, especially with girl athletes, they've gained a lotta strength and confidence in self reflection just from their coaches, from their teammates, and so trying to rehash that you know is like beating a dead horse, it just doesn't, it just doesn't sometimes hold true to them, so using, um, something that they're familiar with, again, within practice, if there's a goal to it, um, they're used to that. Um, you know, you score 15 layups, so you don't have to run a set of lines, so using something they're familiar with, um, they can relate to, um, they can relate to that, so.l 

00:57:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, uh, the fact is, both, uh, uh, the strenghth that uh, someone like Kelsey would have to focus on goals, in teh way in which solution-focused work tends to use goals as a primary operation, seems to come together well, it synthesizes well for uh, the discussion and the dialogue that, uh, you're gonna have with a student athlete that's, uh, like Kelsey where, as you mentioned, too, it might also be something relevant for female student athletes. Um, based on wherever we're at in this dialogue, as a parent, Lisa, does that seem to fit a style or approach that uh, works for you? 

00:58:05
LISA Yeah, I think it was real helpful that the questions that were asked and the direction that it went in, too, you know made Kelsey feel comfortable from what I understand, how it, that dialogue went, and then as well as how it transferred into our conversation. 

00:58:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, see, because there's always that question, uh, about uh, how do you best join with a student athlete when you're uh, uh, engaged in the counseling session, and it does sound like, to a certain extent, rehashing, or reliving, um, certain struggles, or certain um, milestones, if you will. It may not necessarily get deep or get effectively addressed, because maybe they have heard that often from a particular stakeholder, a coach, a teacher, um, their parents, so the role of the school counselor, now, is like that a little bit more of restructuring of the goal, or re-emphasizing of the goal. And, providing along with that, uh, resources and tangible things that they can take with them as they transition to college or, or beyond this, the case may be. Does that uh, seem like an accurate reflection? Excellent. Um, so in terms of, uh, other things, uh, it seems like, uh, there was a fair amount of academic discussion that existed with Kelsey and that is probably also due to certain, um, patterns and styles and expectations that, uh, uh, she faces, uh, in her unique way, but in terms of, uh, working with student athletes in general, uh, how often would you see the academic piece uh, getting addressed in a school counseling session. 

00:59:35
ASHLEY Well I think it also depends on the athlete, what sport they play, and, and gender, to be very up front. Um, uh, you know there are, I don't mean to put, you know, stereotypes out there, but certain sports usually attract students who um, you know, are a little bit more focused on academics, and uh, gender wise, um, girls sometimes, and it, using academics with sports, they mesh really well together. So, um, think taking that into all this. 

01:00:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well yeah and I don't think you are necessarily meaning from a stereotypic standpoint, as much as it is a style or a, um, pattern or strenght that, uh, is often been rewarding for the individual and maybe the peer group or maybe the school climate in which they're accustomed to. So in this particular case the academics seem to be the venue to go with even though it was clear that she's also a successful, uh, athlete and has strengths to draw from in that way, so I guess um, point of the message is to recognize that student athlete isn't just something that needs to focus on athletics, if in fact, um, the student has particular value or strenght that they wish to speak to with academical um, is that, pretty accurately where we're at with this discussion? And in terms of uh, the role as a parent, um, uh, I know sometimes, uh, parents can be expecting certain demands of athletic and academic performance, uh, uh, how do you know as a parent perhaps where to address that or how to bring that out in a way that effectively helps, uh, the student athlete reach uh, his or her goals? 

01:01:15
LISA As far as that balance you mean, like for academics and, well with Kelsey, she really did that herself, um, I didn't know, you know even when she was bringing home her report card, I knew she was bringing home As, I didn't know how much that she was really excelling above and beyond her peers until you know we started applying at colleges and talking to people that she was indeed going to be going to a higher level college and really had her choice of really pretty much any place that she wanted to go. Um, and then in athletics, she there were a couple times there would be a conflict there, and she would have to tell her coach I have to go to this extra session to study for a test and you know that didn't necessarily go over real well, but for the most part, you know, he understood, but it, I think it wasn't until her senior year when he found out she was gonna go Stanford, he was like, oh, I kinda got it now. And I don't think he got it through the process, because he didn't realize how smart she was, and what her potential was. 

01:02:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, so, support, though, um, did arise through the natural um, information and interractions that you had with others, so it seemed to surface in a way. So I guess to kind of, uh, conclude this, uh, let me start with you as a parent, um, how do you see the role of the school counselor, helping to, um, uh, direct the goals and uh, work with the family, uh, and needs when it comes to the uh, direction that, uh, a student athlete is to head? 

01:02:45
LISA Well I think I agree with Ashley a lot of it is, you know, personal basis on what that particular student would need. Um, and Kelsey's, um, you know, perspective talking about the transition to college I think is appropriate. I think, in a lotta ways, her other students would just be in getting that balance between athletics and academics and make sure they can reach their potential, and seeing that as a counselor and an individual. On what that's gonna look like for them. 

01:03:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM In terms of following up and um, maintaining a focus, uh, would you be able to see, uh, a parent and the school counselor connection as something that would be of value? 

01:03:20
LISA Oh, absolutely, yeah, espeically for that student and coming together knowing that the school plan is the same as the home plan and they'll, coming together and working towards the same goal. 

01:03:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent, so it is part of the process, but it's not necessarily meant to uh, take away from the value of, uh, what a parent or a coach or a teacher undergoes when um, dealing with the needs of a student athlete and her family. Ashley what would you do for a follow up, how would you actually make that happen? 

01:03:50
ASHLEY Well, in this and instance, um, you know, we're there was the end of the school year, so um, unfortunately didn't leave enough time, but for you know, this role play, um just making sure that we, um, the family and the student were on the same page in making sure that I was, you know, as supportive as I could be offering resources um, acting as a consultant to whatever their needs may be. Um, just making again sure uh, making again, making sure again that resources were available to them, um, offering just as much support as I could, so. Um, if it weren't the situation, um, say we met freshman year, I would just wanna maintain that relationship. Um, some schools you, you're with the entire family, they're the whole family throughout the years and, um, you know maintain, helping that relationship for the younger generations as well. So. 

01:04:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, sounds like a plan, and I guess timing is everything, I'm sure, and uh, the walk of life, but you know with the rigor and the expectations of, uh, of the school year, and the uh guidelines that one must make for academic and athletic application, seems like it is, uh, a way to go with a plan based on where the athlete is, student goals are at. Okay, um, if there are any other messages or thoughts you have, about uh, what people I think should know about role play like this, um, feel free to- 

01:05:10
ASHLEY I think the only thing we didn't talk about and I think it's hard to see within this scenario because Lisa and her family have definitely weren't this type of family, but, um, we did talk about it, um, when getting to know each other earlier just about the different types of parents in this situations and the pressures they can put on someone, um, we didn't talk about the over pressure, the parent, what we call, you know helicopter parent things like that, um, and what how that can affect a student athlete and um thankfully Kelsey, um, you know, had a great support in a healthy way to her family, but to just recognizing as a counselor if that's going on, and how to best support the family so that you're supporting the student but also supporting the parent as much and recognizing that as much as they may you know want to help their student, they may not be helping their student by adding on these extra pressures, so. 

01:06:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM But even as I hear you now describing that, it sounds again like a solution-focused type of approach and it might be of tremendous value for that. Um, I can easily forsee you asking a scaling question or uh, some type of, uh, structured question to basically help, uh, we'll call it helicopter type or a, a fairly goal driven parent to work effectively with establishing goals and maintaining some sort of follow up connection. Is that fair? Okay, and based on your knowledge of that type of parent style, does that strike you as something as a plausible play of going? 

01:06:35
LISA Yeah, and I think, and I have seen that need, and definitely it would be something where you have to connect with a parent af-, early, uh, freshman year, and recognize that and then deal with it as a very slow approach. I think dealing with a parent like that is, could be very tumultuous and you could get yourself into trouble getting in between that, but I definitely think that, theres a need for that. 

01:06:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So to summarize, it sounds like even though this role play had a lot of support and positive assets associated with it, it has a lot of relevance for, uh, uh, the opposite type of situation, where that as long as we're focused on the goals, the strenghts and the approaches to reaching those goals and strengths, we don't necessarily need to work with a student athlete by rehashing, um, drama, or uh, pressures, or any sort of, um, major type of, um, negative energy that can otherwise break somebody down or put conflict into the mix. But rather that we're here to support, encourage, and structure uh, some sort of follow up and follow through that allows for the student athlete and family to appropriately, uh, interface lets say with the school affectation so that when a decision is made to be either academically or athletically inclined, or both, that uh, it can be done with reasonable reassurance and confidence. That fair? Well, that seems to be a pretty accurate lesson for a lot of people. Well, once again we thank you so much for uh being able to put that onto a film and we thank you again for being able to reflect on it in a way that hopefully will benefit the crowd. 

01:08:05
LISA Thank you. 

01:08:05
ASHLEY Thank you. 

01:08:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM No problem. Thank you.

General Roles of School Counselor -Recognize the athletic system of the student - Recognize the athletic schedule/demands of the student - Recognize the significant stakeholders of the student 

01:08:10
Stakeholder Interactions - Coaches and teachers may not always know that the school counselor is available - Parents can often provide "balance" between counselors and school stakeholders - Counselors should try to "know" the parent before engaging in a problem solving dialogue

DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hi Mrs. Young. 

01:09:05
MRS. YOUNG Hi Dr. Z. 

01:09:05
"One Down Approach" 

01:09:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hi, uh, thank you for making time for this, because I know, uh, there's a lot of stuff that I know you are responsible for, and have to do so I do appreciate the fact that you're able to carve out time in your schedule, um, so from what I understand, uh, there might be some issues uh, I guess going on with Tommy? 

01:09:25
MRS. YOUNG Yeah. 

01:09:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, well, uh, can you tell me a little bit? 

01:09:30
MRS. YOUNG He, um, he's a really great student and he's an athlete, plays baseball, and ever since the baseball season started, his grades have suffered and um, you know we've tried to work on it, but we're, haven't gotten anywhere with it. 

01:09:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, haven't gotten anywhere with what exactly? 

01:09:45
MRS. YOUNG You know, trying to improve his grades, while balancing a sport. 

01:09:50
"Data Gathering with Reframing Approach 

01:09:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so grade-wise where is he at, and what's going on? 

01:09:55
MRS. YOUNG He's pushing Ds, he's typically a B student. 

01:10:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, so, how long has this, uh, trend, uh, kinda been goin' on with the Ds? 

01:10:05
MRS. YOUNG Since the season started, the baseball season. 

01:10:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, so, um, you know, are there particular assignments in the English class he's struggling with, or anything? 

01:10:15
MRS. YOUNG It's basically just getting them in, handing them in, and, um, he's testing okay, but he's not getting his assignments in on time. And he, you know, that's part of his grade. So it suffers. 

01:10:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, does sound like it's bringing it down a bit. Um, what exactly have you attempted to do? 

01:10:35
MRS. YOUNG Well we just started by talking about the importance of you know, balancing school sports and academics and um, he heard me, and I know like I said he's a good student so he wants to do well, but he loves baseball, and so that didn't really take for him, you know, it he heard what I said, but his grades didn't improve. And I had also talked to the coach about it, and, um, made a few phone calls with parents and just all my efforts we just haven't nothing's changed. It's just the same. 

01:11:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So how does Tommy usually uh, take the message and what would I see, I guess, from Tommy, if that discussion were to happen. 

01:11:15
MRS. YOUNG Well he's, he listens, he's eager, he wants to play baseball in college, so he knows that grades are important, but you know, I just, I think he has practice late at night, sometimes games, he comes home late, you know, I get it, I know it's hard to come home and eat dinner and then do homework at nine o'clock, ten o'clock at night, but you know, so we have these conversations he gets it, he's excited, he wants to try harder, but nothing ever happens. 

01:11:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well uh, okay, uh, so I hear that he wants to try harder, and it sounds like uh, that has reached you, um, so, what things indicate that he does try harder, or what things have you seen that show his promise? 

01:11:55
MRS. YOUNG Well I kind of anticipated that his testing would also be slipping a little bit, but he's maintained a pretty good test average, so I know that he's able to, you know, retain what we talk about in class, and you know, he takes notes, but it's really this getting assignments in 

01:12:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Um, can you think of a time, or a specific instance that he retained something in class and it seemed to go over very well? 

01:12:20
MRS. YOUNG When, you know sometimes we talk about a certain novel, in class, and we discuss it and he contributes to converstations, he knows the material, and so, I, I know that he knows it and he cares, but you know, it's, all comes down to those assignments. 

01:12:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So there is something that, that seems to stimulate his interest, but sometimes the assignments don't seem to get there for him. 

01:12:45
MRS. YOUNG Right. 

01:12:45
"Planning and Follow-Up" 

01:12:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And so you also mentioned that you had spoken to coach, uh, you know, topics that came up for that, uh. 

01:12:55
MRS. YOUNG Well I just asked if he had any ways of you know maybe can Tommy get home earlier, you know, because coach knows that grades are another part of school, a huge part of school, and he doesn't want Tommy to fail, but you know he's doing his own job, and so there's not much that he can do from his end, it sounded like. 

01:13:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM That does sound like there's some, um, system in place, or some vibe that you're getting that suggests everybody's trying to see Tommy's potential and though he's doing reasonably okay, it's just there's a downward trend right now. 

01:13:30
MRS. YOUNG Right, Tommy's also, he's great on the team, so coach doesn't want him to have to not be able to play because of academics. So he's trying to keep him on the team, and he knows that grades are part of that, so he, and he's willing to work with me, but, like I said, it's just, I'm hoping that you can be part of this and you know just help us. 

01:13:50
"Planning and Follow-Up" 

01:13:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So uh, yeah, any particular ideas that you may have for me? Or some, um, potentials that you maybe think could help? 

01:14:00
MRS. YOUNG Not specific, just a different perspective, a different outlook on it, because I feel like I've tried everything I can on my own role, and that hasn't done much. 

01:14:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Um, would it, if it's okay, with you, uh, do I have permission to uh, give Tommy some information about uh, some of the strengths and potentials that you see in him? 

01:14:20
MRS. YOUNG Oh definitely, I, I, let him know all the time that I don't think it would hurt to hear more of it. 

01:14:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, because, uh, you know, you mentioned as me being another source, um, there could be maybe some value that's added to that, and perhaps if I join that information in my role in some way, there, there could be a different uh, sort of, uh, perspective or dialogue that he'll hear. 

01:14:40
MRS. YOUNG Right. 

01:14:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so I guess I'll make a plan to do that, I'll I'll consult with coach, and uh, we'll see how to proceed from there. 

01:14:50
MRS. YOUNG Good, thank you so much. 

01:14:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM No problem, thank you. 

01:14:50
Part 2: Consultation with Coach 

01:14:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hi coach. 

01:14:55
COACH Hi. 

01:15:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh, thanks so much for making time for this, because I know you've got probably an immense amount of responsibility in the things you have to keep on top, so uh, appreciate the minutes you can give. 

01:15:10
COACH Oh, no problem, I'm happy I can make time to be here today. 

01:15:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, well that's good. Um, as I think you're aware, uh, we're mainly focused I guess on Tommy right now, um, we know that, uh, you know, he's kinda knee-deep in the middle of, uh, his junior year, and he has a lotta prep I know he needs to do for his athletic goals, and uh, there's been, I guess, some struggles in his English class, uh, I'm just wondering, um, what you know of the situation, what kinds of things have come up? 

01:15:35
"Data Gathering" 

01:15:35
COACH Um, well I think he's had a hard time finishing assignments, but uh, um, I'm wondering if it has something to do with our travel schedule, because, sometimes we have away games or even on regular practice nights he seems to be getting home pretty late. And so I'm wondering if he, he might have some kind of time management issues, or I'm not sure what he's doing, when he gets home, but if we have an away game, he gets home maybe at eight or nine, he has to eat dinner and then start on homework, I'm not sure if it's just lazy, or time management. 

01:16:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so there might be some, um, fatigue or some sort of, uh, thing that drains him at the end of the day, um. Have you ever seen that, uh, uh, play out on the field? Or, in any um, moments that you've had with him? 

01:16:20
COACH Um, yeah, I mean he's a, he's one of our best pitchers and he pitches left handed which is always a key asset to a team, so, um, I always try to keep in there as long as I can, because most of the other batters seem to be right handed most of the time. So, um, you know he can get fatigued, so uh, I'll either pull him out and sit him on the bench or maybe have him play outfield after that as well. Um, sometimes, um, if I feel like mentally he's kinda drained too, I might have him not pitch any more as well. 

01:16:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, uh, he brings I guess a lot of value to the team. I mean he has some assets that are goin' for him? 

01:16:50
COACH Yeah, definitely, I see kind of some leadership, especially you know, as he's rising as a upperclassman and he's well liked on the team, um, so, as long as he's focused on baseball he usually starts off pretty well with us. 

01:17:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so the baseball value and the social value that he has seems to be quite significant, quite, uh, powerful. 

01:17:10
COACH Yeah, like I said, he's well liked, and I think he'll do really well the rest of the season that's here and the senior season as well. 

01:17:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh, have you ever been aware of his struggle with academics or is this a particularly new type of uh, struggle for him? 

01:17:25
COACH Uh, I think maybe the JV coaches may have mentioned that, um, he, maybe last year, he had some kind of you know progress reports and subjects here or there that he seems to be um, kinda of a C or D student most of the time. So like I said I'm not quite sure if it's time management or if he's just not putting in the work. 

01:17:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And I've also been aware too that, uh, you've spoken with Mrs. Young on um, uh, eh, what types of things would come up about uh, Tommy's performance there. 

01:17:55
COACH Well, like I said it's mostly maybe not turning in assignments, and uh, maybe his, his note taking, maybe if you could suggest some kinda study skills or tutoring for that as well, but what I wanna see him do is basically making sure he writes down uh, what his homework is, so at least he knows that hopefully he can take that home and maybe I'll be able to check that as well as especially for comin' off those long road trips like I said. 

01:18:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay so there is some ability to, um, get a plan together, and we certainly, I guess, what appears to be a follow up strategy in mind. So perhaps I guess my role uh, to maybe join with that and could be a benifit. 

01:18:35
COACH Oh definitely. The more people we can get involved, the better. Um, like you mentioned, follow up maybe uh, we've used progress reports you know as well as um, seeing how the student's doing in class due to that progress report. Maybe affect practice time or game time as well. Maybe that could be a motivating factor. 

01:18:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure I think that, that sounds like a plausible idea and um, how about uh, you know, we uh, convene, uh, the two of us with Tommy, see uh, how to get on board with it. 

01:19:00
COACH Okay, sounds great. 

01:19:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, thank you so much appreciate that. 

01:19:05
COACH You're welcome. 

01:19:05
Part 3: Session with Student Athlete and Coach 

01:19:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, uh, Tommy, welcome, thank you for making time for this. 

01:19:15
TOMMY Thank you. 

01:19:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And coach, thanks also uh, for joining in on this, because you know uh, you know there's a lotta things that people have to do in the course of the day, so, thanks for makin' time. Okay, um, Tommy I guess before we even kick it off, uh, I've uh, I've spoken to coach, uh, before we sat down here, and i uh, spoke to Mrs. Young a little bit, about some things that might be goin' on. Um, so in terms of uh, where things are at, uh, I guess you kinda know that, um, there's, there's some stuff goin' on academically I guess, in your English class, right? Okay, um, Is there anything you can tell me about it, or you feel comfortable saying at this time? 

01:19:50
TOMMY Well, just that it's sometimes it's boring, like we read some books, I'm just not into 'em, or other times we'll do group activity, and I really like doing that, because I like working with other people, but we don't do that very often, so, most of the time I'm just sitting there in class listening to her talk and it just gets boring. 

01:20:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, um, is there anything in particular that, that you're turning out, or, you know, you're more likely to you know, get you bored, or- 

01:20:20
TOMMY Well just, well listening to her read a book that I'm not that into, I'll kinda just space it out without even really noticing, so I'll try to be reading the book and paying attention, and going along, but it just won't sink into my head. 

01:20:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM But when it's a group type of focus, it seems to go a little differently? 

01:20:40
TOMMY Yeah, because you know like playing with a baseball team, I like being more group orientated, it's just more, a little enticing. 

01:20:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, coach is that kind of what you, uh, uh, see? 

01:20:50
COACH Yeah, like I said, uh, Tommy's one of our, our better pitchers, so we, he shows a lotta leadership on the field and he's really well liked by his teammates, and, and there's something to say, you know, he'll say stuff to motivate the team or when a big game's coming up. He could feel comfortable speaking to it and things like that as well. 

01:21:05
"Data Gathering with Reframe" 

01:21:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, it seems to be a pretty consistent thing that you have goin for ya, in that you know, people tend to, you know, gravitate toward ya as a leader and kind of um, you're in a position to be around others and share ideas. Yeah, um, how long would you say this has been goin' on with the, uh, with the uh, struggle and the- 

01:21:30
TOMMY I would say, about all year, it just hasn't really worked out that well for me. 

01:21:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM All year, so, when did, uh, baseball season start? 

01:21:35
TOMMY It started after December, after Christmas break. 

01:21:40
"Data Gathering" 

01:21:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, can you walk me through I guess some of the things that you've been doing because of the season starting and- 

01:21:45
TOMMY Well we do pretty much we get outta school, and we go to practice at four, and we have two and a half to three hours practices, I don't get home till seven, seven thirty, and then I have to eat dinner and all that stuff and then I have to start homework when I'm already tired and wanting to go to sleep and exhausted, and it just doesn't, I don't do that well of a job on my homework. 

01:22:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, so, uh, you know at the end of the day, I guess, uh, there's a lot that, you know, you've been through, and kinda, you know like, mm, kinda derails a little bit in the evening? And, uh, has this been something that, uh, you've brought up, uh, with others before, or? 

01:22:25
TOMMY Not really. 

01:22:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Not really. Uh, coach is this ever been discussed, uh, because of the scheduling or anything like that? 

01:22:30
COACH Uh, not too much, I mean usually when we have long bus trips, the players are welcome to start their homework and, some-, sometimes I see Tommy, uh, do it, but like I said, maybe he's one of the players that, you know like most teenagers, they like to sleep or take naps, like he said, when he gets tired, he, or he gets tired by the time he's home, so. Um, you know, sometimes I see Tommy working, sometimes I don't. You know, he, he might not be one of the top students on the team as far as you know actually wanting to uh, get things done before you actually get home, especially like on the long bus trips and things, of that sort. 

01:23:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So Tommy, uh, how, um, are you aware too, uh, of, you know the requirements that you need to be on top of academically? Okay, uh, tell me what your understanding is of that. 

01:23:20
TOMMY Yeah, well you need to get good grades, cuz if you do well, on, in classroom, then it also will go over and do your playing as a baseball player, any other sport that you would play. 

01:23:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, and in terms of, uh, I guess, uh, where you're at right now, and that um, you know, uh, you feel like you're on top of that goal, or? 

01:23:40
TOMMY Not as well as I could be. Feel like I could do better, but, you know. 

01:23:45
"Planning and Follow-Up" 

01:23:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Um, what is it that you think you could particularly do better? 

01:23:50
TOMMY If I just try to put in a little more effort to what I'm doing, take my time when I'm doing my homework. Even if it means staying up later. 

01:24:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, okay, so maybe making a little bit of sacrifice, uh, and, uh, you know chipping away at that in terms of a progress, or goal. Mm, lemme see, uh, coach is this something that you've witnessed before in other ways? Or. 

01:24:15
COACH Um, yeah, I think, uh, Tommy has a lotta long term goals that he's shared with me, I know he wants to play um, college baseball, he wants to play it at a good University, and before that he wants to play it at our local junior college, um, so I know he's set goals for himself, um, on the baseball field, and I'm not so sure though, he's set, you know, um, short term goals, or goals academically, so it's nice to hear him talk about maybe that's something he'd be, he'd be willing to try, or something he feels that could help him progress academically as well. 

01:24:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So it does sound like Tommy you've got some very, uh, uh, strong and quite succesfully inclined long-term goals. I mean, it sounds like you know you've been making a lot of overall progress, but sometimes, in the short term, especially with the every day struggles of your schedule, on the short terms, are harder. 

01:25:05
TOMMY Yeah. 

01:25:05
"Positive Asset Search" 

01:25:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, um, can you think of a time coach, that there's ever been like, a, a short term um, progress, or piece that's come together? 

01:25:15
COACH Um, well I liked how, um, earlier this season when he, when we were playing in the, a tournament, pre-season tournament, he, he struggled um, on the baseball field pitching, but, because, you know, I had faith in him, wanted to instill confidence in him, you know I still gave him his next start as a, as a player cuz, you know, sturggling's gonna happen now and then, but I knew that he knew if I showed him that confidence he would come out next time and hit the goals that we want him to meet, to help us win. 

01:25:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And, um, now, did that work for you Tommy, do you remember what he's talkin' about? 

01:25:50
TOMMY Yeah, it works. 

01:25:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Um, do you remember how it worked for you? Or any particular things that happened at that time? 

01:25:55
"Use of Metaphor" 

01:25:55
TOMMY Well, I mean, you can't always be perfect. It's always, baseball's a game of failure, so, whenever something bad happens, you just have to look past it and look forward to your next great opportunity to do something good. 

01:26:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, actually, honestly, I've never heard it put that way before, but uh, can you tell me a little more about what you mean by baseball's a game of failure? 

01:26:20
TOMMY Well, cuz, if you bat three for ten, you're still batting 300, which is really good for baseball, so it's still, you're getting out seven times of the three hits that you've got, so it's still really good achievement. But, it's also something that you can't get down on yourself with. You just have to stay positive and keep pushin' through it. 

01:26:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, so sometimes you make connections I guess, and you get the hit, but oftentimes, um, you know, you may not see that immediate result? Am I gettin' that right? Hm, um, well that's interesting, do you think that applies to the, what's going on right now? 

01:26:55
"Realistic Focus" 

01:26:55
TOMMY It could, cuz, in school it's also if you don't put in 100 percent effort, then you're not gonna get what you put in, and what you're getting. 

01:27:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, sounds like that, yeah, that actually does kinda fit a little. Um, so in terms of like how you've managed to be patient and kind of turn it around, um, you know what kinda things do you do to kinda, to make that work? 

01:27:20
TOMMY Just, um, trying to stay positive, just work harder, get better. 

01:27:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh, coach, is that what he's been able to do? 

01:27:35
Emotional Focus 

01:27:35
COACH Yeah, like, uh, Tommy seems like a really positive person, so I'm glad he's describing himself that way. Um, like I said, a lotta people look to him as a leader, and he really strives always to get better. So I'm glad, hopefully he can apply that academically the way he has athletically as well. 

01:27:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hm, so, you know it does sound like there's a lot of people out there that kind of see how you can make that better, and, you know even when I was talking to Mrs. Young earlier, um, it seems to be like you know, this, this, let's just say really strong positive potential that kinda, you know, exists, it's just, um, I guess sometimes when the assignments aren't coming in, um, people are looking at it more as, uh uh, he's apt to keep striking. And, uh, I think, um, you know what might be happening is uh, uh, people might be, um, forgetting what it's like to get the hit. Is that fair? Okay, because I think it's interesting that that, you know, even in talking to coach here, and you know, what I've been hearing so far from others is that um, you know hopefully this is something that, uh, that um, you know with a plan and some I guess we'll call it conditioning, for lack of a better term, you know, can, can make some progress. So um, Sounds like we have an idea about how to do that if you'll make those small short term goals work for you. So I guess in terms of um, you know, how to do that, I know coach and I maybe have an idea that would work, um, uh, have you done progress reports? 

01:29:05
TOMMY Yeah. 

01:29:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so um, maybe there's a way to kind of, um, you know particularly target some of those progress reports about these, uh, English assignments that you're going on. Uh, I know coach, uh, with scheduling and and what you had a particular way that you know, that might be able to work and. 

01:29:20
"Planning and Follow-Up" 

01:29:25
COACH Yeah I thought maybe um, because a lot of assignments and tests are at the end of the week, maybe he can bring me a progress report, at, on Friday practices, um, so we can see how he did during the week, and see where, if you're missing anything, so hopefully that can motivate you to get, get that done by the end of the week, and be prepared for you know, weekly test or anything like that. So uh, if it's okay with you, I'd like you to bring a progress report, um, on Friday from Mrs. Young. 

01:29:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And then, uh, you my role I guess can be too, if any particular thing seems to be bringing you back into that slump, or um, you know, um, some assignments are, are, um, in particular, uh, causing some sort of scheduling conflict or disruption, maybe we can talk about how your routine and your time management uh, can be better structured. Uh, because it does sound like that's, you know, something that you know how to focus on for baseball, but maybe with, uh, academics and things that are uh going on in the classroom, maybe they just need to be developed a little more between the two of us. Is that fair? 

01:30:30
TOMMY Yeah. 

01:30:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, and it sounds like, too, if the assignments are, um, you know, not engaging enough, or if there's something that, that, that you're kinda feeling, you know, disconnected from? Um, Mrs. Young I think would be more than willing to at least uh, you know have a talk with you about it. Kinda figure out where you're at with it. Becuase she mentioned too that there've been some novels and books that, uh, you know you seemed to um, be more interested in. Um, do you remember the last one that kind of you know, felt better about when you were reading it? 

01:31:00
TOMMY Well I just like more actiony books. Something that has something that one thing happens, and kind of pulls you in, you wanna see what happens next. 

01:31:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, so it captivates your interest because of the action. Okay, and books that don't have that kind of action maybe um, you probably need to see another angle on, or perspective of. So that's something I'd maybe like to get you to kind of make a tentative plan to do with Mrs. Young. So maybe we can follow up on that too if, uh, you have that dialogue and it seems to you know, matter. Does that sound like a plan? 

01:31:35
TOMMY Yeah, sounds good. 

01:31:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So I think we all have an agreement here, I think um, you know there's a way to hopefully chip away at some of these uh, things, get the assignments back up, because even though it's the middle of the year, it's not necessarily you know an impossible thing to turn around, and hopefully, as with all these people that are rootin' for ya, um, there's probably a way to get this goal happen. 

01:31:55
TOMMY Yeah. 

01:31:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, is there anything else you need to run by me before we're done? 

01:31:55
TOMMY I don't think so, think we covered all. 

01:32:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM All right, and you feel okay about where we're at? 

01:32:00
TOMMY Yeah I do. 

01:32:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, thanks Tommy, because I appreciate ya. 

01:32:05
TOMMY Thank you. 

01:32:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Being willing to be part of it. And coach, uh, again, thanks so much, because uh, you know it's not every uh, uh, day that I think we can coordinate everybody's schedule. 

01:32:10
COACH All right, thanks for having me, any other players you wanna speak with let me know too. 

01:32:20
[music] 

01:32:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Thank you, I think that might be helpful.

Current Student Athlete Role Play 

01:33:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, Brittany and Phillip thank you very much for, uh, you know, being able to do the role-play, and hopefully uh, we can reflect on some points that uh, will be helpful for the audience. Uh, I guess, uh, in general, um, we've done this role-play in a way where I think it's pretty typical the, uh, school day where you have limited time, but, uh, important points that probably need to come out, um, when working with a, a student athlete who might be in a difficult place or struggling in a particular time. So in terms of, I guess, the fact that things were brief, um, let's talk about maybe how that worked and what the highlights were in each case when we work together. Uh, I guess we'll start with Brittany, because as teacher, I think it's important to kind of start there if that's where the, uh, the issue or the main point to be addressed is at. As a, uh, teacher and consultation with the school counselor, uh, what worked for ya, and how did it feel to be in that role? 

01:34:10
BRITTANY I definitely appreciated the, uh, how you appreciated my lack of time. You know we were able to get a lot of information out in a short amount of time. And, um, the questions you asked really helped me talk about what I've done, and then I, you know, unbeknownst to you, got to reflect on what I did myself. 

01:34:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, and I think that's important too, to recognize that, um, people do have limited time, and sometimes I don't think we verbalize that enough. Um, sometimes putting that out there and being explicit about it can, uh, hopefully go a long way in establishing a good, uh, report in consultative relationship. Uh, and also I guess too in terms of um, you know the way in which you felt appreciated, about the the work that you've done, I think that's also important, too, because as consultants we can sometimes come in there and assume that, uh, we have all the answers that we know best, and uh, it's important to recognize that you know, you're on the front line, you're the main contact in many cases with student athlete. Uh, in, uh, I guess being valued in that way is important for the consultation too. 

01:35:10
BRITTANY Yeah, I definitely felt heard. 

01:35:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, and, uh, and so that, uh, did being heard seem to um, impact the way the briefness of the session was for you? 

01:35:25
BRITTANY Yes, because, you know I was busy I had a place to be, but um, you know, you definitely respected that, and we got, I was surprised at how much information we got out. 

01:35:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Mmhmm, I think that's a pretty fair way of, uh, of looking at that, I appreciate that, and, uh, Phillip, as Coach I guess uh, we had a very similar type of uh, engagement and dialogue, uh, how did it strike you? 

01:35:45
PHILLIP Uh, mostly in the same way, I appreciated that time management, but also how direct your questions were. Um, obviously for the video you prepared, but, um, it would be a nice expectation for a counselor to have as well, to know what questions to ask the coach. And also the fact that you met with me before you brought Tommy in with me, I think it would be different if, or, you brought Tommy and myself in without previouisly speaking with me, too. 

01:36:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, I guess kind of bring up almost a metaphor, it seems like we had a game plan, and, uh, in so doing that, um, you know we organized and prepared and in so doing maybe didn't ambush Tommy, or, or, or subject him to some sort of judgmental dialogue as much as we tried to figure out, okay, this seems to be a strategy. 

01:36:30
PHILLIP And, right, along with not wanting to ambush him, I, I think as a coach I would have felt kind of in the dark as well, if you just brought me and Tommy in to speak about him academically, so I really appreciated the previous meeting as well. 

01:36:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, thank you, because I think that's a good point to make, um, sometimes I think in a lot of school systems, people feel compressed and strained for time and in so doing, um, you know, the gesture of meeting beforehand may feel like something that can be sacrificed and it seems like in this particular instance, even though yes we made preparations for this video, um, the spontaneity of it seemed to go a long way. And put a lot people at ease when it came time to addressing Tommy. 

01:37:10
PHILLIP Yeah, like I said, I really appreciated the questions you brought to me, and seemed like you really knew what information you wanted to get to create that kinda game plan when you got in here. 

01:37:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so that seems to, um, be a similar process in picking up with both school stakeholders here in this case. Okay. Um, in terms of the strategy and plans that we had, um, for Tommy, uh, I guess, um, you know how typical is that of, uh, the strategy that we use in, uh, when we see a student athlete struggling academically? Um, what maybe struck me with you as coach, Phillip, was that uh, was that, uh, the typical way that we would address that? 

01:37:50
PHILLIP Yeah I think, uh, sometimes it's hard for a coach cause to know um, what classes the student's struggling with, cuz, um, the students, even while, though you might have a great relationship with them on the field, or in athletics, they might be kinda, even though you have a trusting relationship there, they may be kind of hesitant to let you know what's going on in the classroom. So um, I think the progress report works well, but sometimes it's hard to establish or get going, so, um, you know I think this, this kind of recommendation that we gave to Tommy will help him. But it's kind of hard to get going especially throughout the season. Or know what part of the season to put it in place. 

01:38:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure, because there seems to be a very intricate schedule that goes with that, and I guess uh, in a school counseling role, um, you know strategies and plans are important, but you also have to respect the fact that, you know, they're primarily, um, working with the coach and primarily working with the teacher to uh, establish what they need to make their goals come true. So um, yeah, I think, uh, it's important to recognize the intricacies that you're speaking of, with at the same time to uh, best align with them when it comes to addressing the, the issue at hand. 

01:38:55
PHILLIP Yeah. 

01:38:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, um, in terms, of, uh, the way we communicated, Brittany, too, uh, I, I also I think um, said, what have you done, and uh, to, to, um, make uh, plans with Tommy and uh, and then I asked, uh, then I guess for permission to bring that along into uh, uh, Tommy's session later. Uh, how did that strike you as a teacher to have that sort of, um, let's call it a loaded question or game plan to, to facilitate that goal? 

01:39:25
BRITTANY Well I thought the specific question was refreshing, cuz as a teacher, you want students to know constantly that they're achieving, that people believe in them, and I know, you know, I was telling him these things, and I assume as a teacher that other people are, but to hear you ask permission to repeat the encouraging words that I say to him, that was just wonderful, those are the things I like to hear as a teacher. 

01:39:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, and that's, that's good that, uh, I mean, I think the intent of it is to show respect but at the same time, to, to show also how can we align as a team to help Tommy, as opposed to um, feeling like there is a benefit of sharing that information, because it'll pleasantly surprise him. Uh, it seems like sometimes if you're not included on the team, or in that dialogue, uh, you know, you can feel separated or that you've been in some way, undermined or betrayed even by uh, a school counselor that maybe has a good intention to help the student athlete, but might be creating some kind of rift or conflict between, uh, the student and the teacher which may not be necessary. 

01:40:35
BRITTANY Right, and when you said being aligned, I just, it was another feeling when you said that because I felt like we were on the same page. And, you know, I know that I'd worked with the coach on some things just hoping that whoever's involved in this can be on the same page, and knowing that you were gonna use the same words I did, it was just refreshing. 

01:40:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, yeah, and I think matching the dialogue is, is important. Um, and speaking of dialogue, I think it was interesting, Phillip when we sat down with Tommy together, uh, some of the dialogue turned to sports and some of itturned to academics, and it sounded like in some ways it was important that it turned up in particular ways. Um, specifically, uh, when we got the the point about talking about uh, what it's like to get hits, and how baseball is a game of failure, uh, that that didn't come generated from school counselor, but rather from both you and Tommy, um, I was just wondering what your thoughts would be about that. And how it seemed to go. 

01:41:25
PHILLIP Right, so, um, I think it is interesting that a lot of our um, we use a lot of metaphors in our session, as well as um, he brought up the failure aspect of the game, which I've heard before, um, but you can really tell that that was part of his mentality in that was part of his personality that came through. I play a sport, um, where a lot of times you do fail, you know, like he said, seven out of ten times, you might not get a hit, but the three times you do, that makes you look like a really good player. So you could really tell that he wanted to be positive, and he, he learned that positivity through sports and that he was willing to consider academically as well. 

01:42:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Absolutely, and I think, um, you know hearing that perhaps from you know a reflecting standpoint where, uh, he says it first, and then I as school counselor, um, authority figure, uh, repeat it, uh, kinda shows a little more respect and value to that, um, meaning, or that, uh, value. As if I were to do it without, uh, consulting with him first, or just assuming that I know, uh, his sports metaphors and dialogues in the same way. Uh, it sounds like we're not likely to be aligned if it doesn't come from the athletic sources in the room. And, uh, in so doing that I think that again, kinda using Brittany's term of being aligned, or feeling aligned, it, it enhanced it that much more, and probably made the plan that much more likely to come together. 

01:42:50
PHILLIP Yeah, and you could see kind of a light bulb kinda went off in his head, and he was maybe more open to it than he would if you maybe went about it a different way. Once you repeated it and showed him, and then he kinda saw that I was supporting him, and wanted him to do all this also. 

01:43:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, so let me shift that to Brittany, just uh, as uh, kind of a way of including you here. Um, in a classroom if you're trying to sometimes intervene with a struggling student athlete, um, does that seem like something that would work there, too? Through the use of a sports metaphor, or sports dialogue to convey the academic points? 

01:43:25
BRITTANY Oh, I think with soem students, because some metaphors doesn't work with everybody. But definitely um, if I have a student who I know can grasp what I'm expressing to them, definitely it's a good method. 

01:43:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, and I'm sure there are teachers that could try to incorporate that, but I guess the point is to try to be mindful about how it comes out, and maybe when generated from the student, it probably uh, becomes an easier dialogue to have than if it's generated primarily from the authority figure, or teacher, in this case. Okay, in terms of the actual plan, being able to do progress reports, um, is that, uh, uh, usually, um, with the first line of defense, is, I guess to address this type of goal, I mean coach, Phillip, is that a typical strategy? 

01:44:10
PHILLIP Um, yeah, I've seen it done in a couple of different ways, and in at least two schools that I worked at. Um, so weekly progress reports either for one subject, or for all subjects is something that coaches have used before. Um, like I tried to mention in the video, um, I think possibly time management skills are really important for students of this age, too, so, I llike the way you kind of concluded the session with that saying we'll use this progress report, but I also wanna meet with you separately to teach you these skills as well. 

01:44:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, and I think that, that's encouraging to hear, too, because I think that my role as school counselor is to basically not infringe on the, uh, the plans or the, uh, tactics or the usual strategies that, uh, coaches uh have with their students, cuz I think, um, we're pretty much all in agreement that the, the student athlete and coach bond is probably one of the most prominent ones that, uh, the student athlete is exposed to, and um, infringing on that a little bit can wreck credibility or uh, the chances of a plan being followed through, because it seems like we're coming out of left field for lack of a better term. Or, we're intruding on something that's really too personal for them to feel like we have any uh, in road to make with the student athlete. So um, I thank you for that, because I think, um, study skills, time managment though teachers uh have that, uh, uh, ability to deliever that, the school counselor can leave that as an open dialogue and hopefully get a, uh, student athlete to, to pursue that in his or her own terms if this follow up doesn't progress in the direction we hope it will. Uh, and as a teacher, Brittany, hearing that, um, does that, uh, seem to fit, or does it, out of the bounds in terms of time management? 

01:45:45
BRITTANY No, no, it fits perfectly. 

01:45:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, well, thank you for that, cuz, sometimes I, I guess teachers do feel like they have a lot, of, uh, things to do to focus on curriculum and time management skills, uh, sometimes are a natural, um, part of that dialogue that sometimes, um, it isn't, and maybe the school counselor voice helps interface with that. Okay, well based on where we're at here, uh, are there any take home messages, or uh, main things that uh, if you can tell an audience of school counselors what works well, or how to interface well as a teacher or a coach involved in a struggling student athlete situation, uh, what those would be. Are there any thoughts that anybody has? 

01:46:25
PHILLIP Um, I think that, the, it's good to get the coaches involved, um, definitely coaches are gonna react differently, and like you said, um, as long as you keep uh, people's time in mind, that's key, uh, but also know that there's coaches, like you said, the bond is really strong, so if you get a good coach, and a student um, on the same page, or to develop the game plan, as we said, um, it really can go a long way. Um, as far as what we can do together as a kind of a school community, um, to teach them the skills that the school counselor has. The, the teacher and the coach can, can't provide for them. 

01:47:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM I think that that is actually well said, too, is that, you know, certainly as there are different types of student athletes, there are also certainly different types of coaches and people that are, uh, on the other end of preparing, uh, student athletes, um, to deal with issues in different ways. Can I get you to elaborate too on what you think are largely uh, skills that would indicate, uh, a good coach, or that would likely work well in this type of dialogue? 

01:47:30
PHILLIP Just someone that's open to meeting with teachers and school counselors. Someone that knows they're um, all their lpayers really well. Knows the parents, the families, and the player situation. Um, someone that wants to see the succeed academically too, cuz some coaches uh, might be more interested in you know funneling them through their team and seeing where they progress afterwards, but so someone that cares about the student academically knows the family and is willing to work with the school community. 

01:48:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So that might be an important point to assessment anyway, for, uh, school counselors to have this dialogue and you know, kind of what they're getting into if they're aware of what types of skills are um, strategies might work best to, to align themselves with a coach that invested in such a way. I thank you for that, that's pretty helpful. And Brittany, in terms of teachers and school counselors interracting, are there any main points you'd like to bring out? 

01:48:25
BRITTANY Yeah, I think as a teacher, it's easy to get really frustrated and feel like there's nothing else I can do. And teachers also forget that there are counselors available and that they can help, and so, definitely just to encourage teachers to utilize counselors because like I was asking you for a different perspective on it, and they're definitely there. And, um, from a counselor's point, just to remember that teachers sometimes forget counselors are there to help, so maybe you know, encourage them to communicate, together. 

01:49:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sort of have a visible presence, if you will. 

01:49:00
BRITTANY Definitely. 

01:49:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Not necessarily a bossy presence, but at least an accesssible one. 

01:49:05
BRITTANY Right, just to be accessible and that you're here to offer anything that you can. 

01:49:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, well excellent. Uh, all I can say is, you know, it was definitely brief, and to the point, but wow was it powerful. And I think that, that's the true sign of what makes for effective counseling with student athletes and that stakeholders that they wish to uh, involve and hopefully build that supportive network I think Phillip was alluding to. I know that Brittany, you've uh, endorsed in the ways that you've answered these questions. So, uh, again, thank you both, uh, I think that was a pretty powerful piece, and uh, a way to hopefully build uh, a better support and report for student athletes that are similar to this case. Thank you again. 

01:49:45
BRITTANY Thank you. 

01:49:45
PHILLIP Thank you.
