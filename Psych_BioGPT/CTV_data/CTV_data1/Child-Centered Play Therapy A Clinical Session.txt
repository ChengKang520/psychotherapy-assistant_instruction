Child-Centered Play Therapy: A Clinical Session Dr. Garry Landreth 

00:00:00
Child-Centered Play Therapy: A Clinical Session Produced and Directed By Dr. Garry L. Landreth Director, Center for Play Therapy University of North Texas Denton, Texas 

00:00:00
NARRATOR In this video, we're allowed the privilege of seeing the therapist child interaction, and feeling the emotions generated in an initial play therapy session with a child. From the moment of entering the playroom to ending the session these are not planned experiences. There is no script. They are spontaneous interactions that allow us a unique view into the therapist's typical approach to a child in play therapy. In this video, you will see Dr. Garry Landreth's approach to making contact with the child and the early stages of developing a relationship with the child. Dr. Landreth is regents professor and founder and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, the largest play therapy training program in the world. Dr. Landreth is internationally recognized as one of the foremost spokesman for and developer of The Child-Centered approach to play therapy. He has pioneered child-centered play therapy for training and international settings such as China, Korea and South Africa and is a frequent conference speaker and workshop presenter throughout the United States. Dr. Landreth's over 70 public patients include the books Play Therapy: Dynamics of the Process of Counseling With Children, Play Therapy Interventions With Children's Problems and Play Therapy: The Art of Relationships, which is widely considered to be an authoritative source on child-centered play therapy. Dr. Landreth has received numerous awards for his work, including the Virginia X Line Distinguished Contributor to Play Therapy award. 

00:01:40
DR. LANDRETH And this is the door to the special playroom. Kate, this is a place where you can play with the toys in a lot of the ways you would like to. 

00:01:55
KATE Do you have wear a paint shirt over when you paint? 

00:01:55
DR. LANDRETH Well that's something you can decide. Sounds like you're thinking about painting. You can wear a paint shirt if you want to or.. 

00:02:05
KATE (crosstalk) I do. 

00:02:05
DR. LANDRETH You want to wear a paint shirt. Well the paint shirts are down there. 

00:02:05
KATE Okay. 

00:02:10
DR. LANDRETH This time together is the child's time. I want to create an understanding, accepting, and non evaluative relationship in which the child will feel safe. Safe enough to explore, safe enough to risk, and safe enough to be fully the person she is capable of being. This kind of freeing relationship begins by returning direction and control to the child at the very beginning of our relationship by allowing the child to make decisions about what to play and how to play, although there are a few broad limits. In this time together, it is the child who leads the way. Allowing the child to make choices helps to create a permissive relationship in which the child is allowed to accept responsibility. 

00:03:00
KATE Yeah, I wanna play in the sandbox. 

00:03:05
DR. LANDRETH So you've decided you're gonna get in that sandbox right there. 

00:03:05
KATE Yeah. 

00:03:10
DR. LANDRETH Uh huh. 

00:03:10
KATE Mom lets me sit in it. 

00:03:10
DR. LANDRETH Oh, so, to sit in the sand. Hmm. 

00:03:15
KATE Yeah. Is that alright with y'all? 

00:03:20
DR. LANDRETH That's something you can decide in here if you want to sit in the sandbox. 

00:03:20
DR. LANDRETH This response returns responsibility for direction and decision making to the child and facilitates creativity. The child then feels empowered. 

00:03:35
DR. LANDRETH And I see you've decided to sit in the sandbox. 

00:03:35
KATE I got a big one of these things. 

00:03:40
DR. LANDRETH Oh, so you've seen one like that before? 

00:03:40
KATE Not like this. Mine is real bigger than this. 

00:03:45
DR. LANDRETH Oh yours is bigger than that one, even. Mmm. 

00:03:45
KATE Yeah. I put mud in my sandbox. 

00:03:50
DR. LANDRETH And you're, so you have a sandbox, too, mm. 

00:03:55
KATE Yeah and I've been to the beach before. 

00:04:00
DR. LANDRETH And you've even been to the beach where there's sand, hmm. 

00:04:00
KATE Yeah, and I got some, I got some seashells there. 

00:04:05
DR. LANDRETH And you found seashells at the beach. 

00:04:10
KATE A little bit. 

00:04:10
DR. LANDRETH Hm, sounds like you did lots of things at the beach. 

00:04:15
KATE Did you .. Have you been to the beach? 

00:04:20
DR. LANDRETH I've been to the beach and you've been to the beach, so you know what that's like. 

00:04:20
KATE Do you have any grandkids? 

00:04:25
DR. LANDRETH Don't have any grandchildren. Don't have any little children like you. So I get to come in the playroom with boys and girls your size. Hm, you're just smoothing it all the way off. There, plopped it right in the bucket. 

00:04:45
DR. LANDRETH Child-centered play therapy is a way of being with children rather than doing something to or for children. The focus of the play therapist is on the person of the child. What the child is capable of becoming, rather than on the child's ways of being in the past. If I focus on the child's problem, I will very likely lose sight of the child. I want to relate to this child as a person to be understood, rather than as someone to be cured or changed. 

00:05:15
KATE Uh oh. 

00:05:20
DR. LANDRETH Found something right there in your sand. 

00:05:25
[sil.] 

00:05:25
DR. LANDRETH Just sifting the sand right down into the bucket. Yep, you're making it go right down in there. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:45
DR. LANDRETH Hm. Poured it all in. 

00:05:50
KATE Now I'm gonna make a puppet show. 

00:05:55
DR. LANDRETH Oh so you've decided you're going to make a puppet show now. 

00:06:00
KATE Yeah. 

00:06:00
DR. LANDRETH Mm. 

00:06:00
KATE I'll be getting ready. I'll be right there. 

00:06:05
DR. LANDRETH (crosstalk)You're gonna-You're gonna get ready right there, yup. 

00:06:05
KATE (inaudible ) 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:15
DR. LANDRETH Which ones to use? There's one. 

00:06:20
KATE A doctor. 

00:06:20
DR. LANDRETH A doctor. 

00:06:25
[sil.] 

00:06:25
KATE I want.. He's a doctor. This is a girl. 

00:06:40
[sil.] 

00:06:40
KATE And, hmm, (inaudible ) 

00:06:50
DR. LANDRETH Hm, just trying to decide which one to use next. 

00:06:55
KATE Hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. LANDRETH Ooh, that was way back there. There you got it. 

00:07:05
KATE This is a bear. 

00:07:05
DR. LANDRETH A bear. 

00:07:05
KATE Two, one more. 

00:07:10
DR. LANDRETH One more there. One in that hand. 

00:07:15
KATE Yeah, I need hel- Would you help- 

00:07:20
DR. LANDRETH Oh, so you need some help to put this one on this end, cause you've got a bear on that hand.-- 

00:07:25
KATE (crosstalk)Cause I got a bear-- Yeah. 

00:07:25
DR. LANDRETH Looks like this is supposed to come up like this. 

00:07:30
DR. LANDRETH This is a relationship in which the child leads. Therefore I wait for the child to decide when she feels safe enough to approach me or to include me in her play rather than inserting myself into her physical space at my discretion. 

00:07:45
DR. LANDRETH Oh, there goes your hand right in there. 

00:07:50
KATE Okay, I'll be right back! 

00:07:50
DR. LANDRETH You're gonna be right back. Looks like you're going right over there now. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:00
DR. LANDRETH There you are. Whoops! Ah sometimes things fall in here. 

00:08:05
KATE Yeah. 

00:08:05
DR. LANDRETH That was an accident, I can tell, that was an accident. 

00:08:10
KATE I think you need to put it back up. 

00:08:10
DR. LANDRETH Well let's see, show me how you want to put this thing back up. Let's see, real quick. Oh, like that! Okay this goes up like this. And- 

00:08:25
KATE Whoa [inaudible]. 

00:08:30
DR. LANDRETH Oh and you want this closed like that. 

00:08:30
KATE Yep. 

00:08:30
DR. LANDRETH So you know how it goes back together. Mhm. 

00:08:35
KATE Get that side. 

00:08:40
DR. LANDRETH And that goes right there like that. So you, you got I back just like it was! You knew how to do that. 

00:08:50
KATE Yep! I'll be right there! 

00:08:50
DR. LANDRETH You'll be right there and I'll be right over here. I see you in there, there you are again. 

00:08:55
KATE Uh oh. 

00:09:00
DR. LANDRETH Well that thing fell again. 

00:09:00
KATE Yeah I don't think we need that. 

00:09:00
DR. LANDRETH No you may not need that. 

00:09:05
KATE Some kids need it? 

00:09:05
DR. LANDRETH Some children need it and some don't. You've, you've just decided that you don't need that right now for what you want to do. 

00:09:15
KATE (inaudible[00:09:18)] I need to lose my hair. I'll go (inaudible ). Here, I'll be right back. 

00:09:25
DR. LANDRETH There you are right there. 

00:09:25
KATE Deebadeebadeeba I'm through. 

00:09:30
DR. LANDRETH And you're all through with your puppet show. I see you threw the puppet show place right there. 

00:09:40
Basic Principles Child-Centered Play Therapy 

00:09:40
DR. LANDRETH Axline's eight basic principles of child-centered play therapy serve as a guide for making therapeutic contact with a child. 

00:09:50
1. Warm caring relationship 

00:09:50
DR. LANDRETH They are: a warm caring relationship is developed 

00:09:55
2. Unqualified acceptance 

00:09:55
DR. LANDRETH The therapist experiences unqualified acceptance of the child. 

00:10:00
3. Safety & permissiveness 

00:10:00
DR. LANDRETH The therapist creates a feeling of safety and permissiveness in the relationship. 

00:10:05
4. Sensitivity to child's feelings 

00:10:05
DR. LANDRETH The therapist is sensitive to the child's feelings and reflects those feelings in such a way that the child gains insight. 

00:10:15
5. Respect capacity to act responsibly 

00:10:15
DR. LANDRETH The therapist believes in the child's capacity to act responsibly. 

00:10:20
6. Child leads play & conversation 

00:10:20
DR. LANDRETH The child is allowed to lead in play and conversation. 

00:10:25
7. Therapeutic process not hurried 

00:10:25
DR. LANDRETH The therapeutic process cannot be hurried. 

00:10:25
8. Minimal limits set 

00:10:25
DR. LANDRETH Minimal limits are set. 

00:10:30
KATE Now I'm gonna paint. Where the paint shirts again? 

00:10:35
DR. LANDRETH Now you've decided to paint. The paint shirt is on the other side of the paper there, right there. Oh you've found it. 

00:10:45
KATE Oh, I can't get it. There. 

00:10:50
DR. LANDRETH There you did get it. 

00:10:55
[sil.] 

00:10:55
KATE Uh- 

00:10:55
DR. LANDRETH Hm, looks like the puppet is on there. 

00:11:05
[sil.] 

00:11:05
KATE Are you supposed to put it over like, through here 

00:11:20
DR. LANDRETH Looks like it can go that way. You figured it out. 

00:11:25
KATE Do you put it over your arms? 

00:11:25
DR. LANDRETH Hm, in like that, mhm. 

00:11:30
KATE Whoa. 

00:11:30
DR. LANDRETH Looks like you know how that's supposed to go. Mmhmm. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:40
DR. LANDRETH Got a bunch of paint on that and you're putting it right up there. And now down that way and that way, oh and back across there. Mhm. 

00:11:55
KATE Looks like the yellow's almost gone. 

00:12:05
DR. LANDRETH Hmm, so you don't think there's much yellow left in there. 

00:12:05
KATE You know what? I can use yellow like this. 

00:12:15
DR. LANDRETH Mhm you can use it just the way you want to use it. 

00:12:15
KATE And you can make green out of it. That's green-yellow. 

00:12:20
DR. LANDRETH Oh so you know how to make another color, green-yellow. 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:30
KATE What's this? 

00:12:30
DR. LANDRETH Hmm. That can be for whatever you it to be for. 

00:12:45
[sil.] 

00:12:45
DR. LANDRETH Kate moves freely and at her own pace from one play material to another. Since toys are considered to be children's words, and play is their language, careful attention must be paid to the selection of toys and materials that allow for children's self directed activity and that facilitate a wide range of feelings and play behaviors. All toys and materials do not automatically encourage children to express their feelings, needs and experiences. 

00:13:15
DR. LANDRETH Like that. 

00:13:20
KATE And I (inaudible ) 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:25
DR. LANDRETH Hm, smells. 

00:13:30
KATE Yeah, that smells. Over to the, the brown. 

00:13:35
DR. LANDRETH And you're gonna put a bunch of the brown. 

00:13:40
KATE A bunch of the brown. 

00:13:45
DR. LANDRETH You're just putting lots of colors on that. 

00:13:50
KATE Did I put green on it? Oh. 

00:13:55
DR. LANDRETH Hm wonder if you did put green. Well there's some right there. And some more of that. 

00:14:05
KATE (inaudible ) Way at the top like that. 

00:14:10
DR. LANDRETH Way at the top you're gonna put green. Hm. 

00:14:15
KATE Make some yellow. Whoa. 

00:14:20
DR. LANDRETH Hm. 

00:14:20
KATE I think we need to get some more yellow paint. 

00:14:25
DR. LANDRETH Oh so you think we need more yellow paint. You'd like to have more of that color to paint with. 

00:14:30
KATE Yeah. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:35
KATE I'm gonna give this picture to you. 

00:14:45
DR. LANDRETH So you're painting a picture just for me? Mm. 

00:14:50
DR. LANDRETH An enthusiastic, "Oh thank you! You paint such beautiful pictures!", would be evaluative and structuring. This kind of praise directs children's behavior, restricts their freedom, creates dependency and fosters external motivation. My objective is to free children to develop an internal system of reward and satisfaction. 

00:15:15
DR. LANDRETH And some of that. 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:20
KATE [00:15:25 Why doesn't somebody..]There used to be paint right there? 

00:15:30
DR. LANDRETH Hm wonder if there did used to be paint there. 

00:15:30
KATE Why's the paint not there anymore? 

00:15:35
DR. LANDRETH Hm. Just not there right now. 

00:15:35
KATE Where is it? 

00:15:40
DR. LANDRETH I don't know. It looks like you think there should be some paint for that hole right there. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:50
DR. LANDRETH In this relationship, evaluation of any kind is steadfastly avoided. I would not evaluate a child's picture even though the child might insist on knowing if I think her picture is pretty. Instead, I would describe what I see by perhaps saying, "You put some green all the way across the bottom," pointing to the picture as I describe. "Some blue up here, and this color over here. You made it just the way you wanted it to be." Evaluative statements deprive the child of inner motivation. 

00:16:25
KATE Sometimes I get it on the floors. 

00:16:30
DR. LANDRETH Uh huh, sometimes the paint does get on the floor mhm. That happens in here. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:40
KATE Put the blue in there. Put the green in there. 

00:16:45
DR. LANDRETH Mhm. So you put them right back there. 

00:16:45
KATE I put- 

00:16:45
DR. LANDRETH You put the blue one over there and the green one over there. 

00:16:50
KATE I put the green one in here. 

00:16:55
DR. LANDRETH The green one in that one mhm. And the blue one over there. You think that's kind of funny to mix them up. 

00:17:00
KATE Yeah. Can I do another picture? 

00:17:05
DR. LANDRETH That's for you to decide in here if you want to do another picture. 

00:17:10
KATE Yeah. Can I take this thing off? 

00:17:10
DR. LANDRETH That's for taking off. Looks like you know how to take it off. Just like that. 

00:17:20
KATE Whoa. 

00:17:25
DR. LANDRETH And that one comes off like that. Hm looks like that came apart. So you can just put it right over there. 

00:17:35
KATE (crosstalk)Whoa. I don't know where to put it. 

00:17:40
DR. LANDRETH You can decide where to put it in this room. 

00:17:40
KATE Hm. On the floor I guess. 

00:17:45
DR. LANDRETH So you just decided to put it on the floor. 

00:17:45
KATE Yeah I hope I don't get paint on it. 

00:17:50
DR. LANDRETH And you want to make sure you don't get paint on it. 

00:17:50
KATE Ew. 

00:17:55
DR. LANDRETH Mhm. Sometimes the paint gets on the floor in here. 

00:17:55
KATE There? 

00:18:00
DR. LANDRETH Mhm. 

00:18:00
KATE I got it on my arm. 

00:18:00
DR. LANDRETH Oh and you even got a little paint on your arm right there, mhm. 

00:18:05
KATE Yeah, I did. Silly (inaudible ). I'm a silly girl. I think I'm running out of paper. 

00:18:10
DR. LANDRETH Oh, you might even run out of paper. 

00:18:20
[sil.] 

00:18:20
DR. LANDRETH Mm. 

00:18:25
KATE Oh. Help. I think I need help with this. 

00:18:25
DR. LANDRETH (crosstalk) You know that close- Think you need some help with that. I can see that you know how to do it. I'll hold this for you up here. And you show me what you want me to do. 

00:18:35
KATE Put it on, yeah, put it on 

00:18:45
DR. LANDRETH (crosstalk)Put it on like this. Let's see if you squeeze on this, I'll squeeze right here and you squeeze on that. And right, right there. Whoops, there you- There you got it right there. Okay. 

00:18:55
KATE (crosstalk)Uh oh. 

00:18:55
DR. LANDRETH Okay. 

00:18:55
KATE Now this. 

00:19:00
DR. LANDRETH And you're gonna get this one right here. 

00:19:00
KATE I got that one that one there. 

00:19:05
DR. LANDRETH And you're gonna put that one right...right there! There you've got it. You fixed your paper. 

00:19:15
DR. LANDRETH I want to allow children to discover their strengths. When we do for children what they can do for themselves, we teach children they are weak. When children are allowed to struggle in the midst of a caring, understanding relationship, they discover untapped resources and strengths that they need for coping with life. 

00:19:35
KATE Bee how, beehive. 

00:19:40
DR. LANDRETH Big paint for a big house. 

00:19:40
KATE No a beehive. 

00:19:40
DR. LANDRETH Oh a beehive. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:50
DR. LANDRETH So that right up there. Hm, some more of that color. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:05
DR. LANDRETH Hm, that's just running right down that way. 

00:20:20
KATE Why's it running down? 

00:20:20
DR. LANDRETH Hm sure did. Sometimes that happens in here. You're not- I heard that noise too. 

00:20:30
KATE What was it? 

00:20:30
DR. LANDRETH It was a noise out there. It sound like a door. Somebody closed the door. We heard that all the way in here. 

00:20:40
KATE It was loud. 

00:20:45
DR. LANDRETH It was loud. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
KATE This yellow color. 

00:20:55
DR. LANDRETH You're gonna put that color right in that one. 

00:20:55
KATE That one in here, mix it with red! 

00:21:05
DR. LANDRETH And mix it with red. That's kind of funny to you. You mixed it up. 

00:21:10
DR. LANDRETH I do not ask children questions about their paintings or any of their play behavior. That would place the emphasis of our relationship on verbal responses and would contradict the reason of play setting as utilized. Asking questions would also place me in the lead and would structure the child's direction. 

00:21:30
DR. LANDRETH Over there. 

00:21:30
KATE Ew. I got paint on my finger. How'd I do that? 

00:21:35
DR. LANDRETH Wonder how you did get paint on your finger. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:40
DR. LANDRETH Up and down in the paint can. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:50
DR. LANDRETH So you're painting two. 

00:22:00
KATE It's gonna be a lot of paint on this. 

00:22:00
DR. LANDRETH Gonna be a lot of paint, you've decided, on that picture. 

00:22:05
KATE When I'm done with this, two of these are for you. 

00:22:10
DR. LANDRETH Oh so there gonna be two for me you've made. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
KATE And a little paint on there. 

00:22:30
DR. LANDRETH And a little paint you've put right on the handle of that brush. 

00:22:35
KATE No. A little right there. 

00:22:40
DR. LANDRETH And now you're gonna get it right there where the paint is-isn't. 

00:22:45
KATE There's that. 

00:22:50
DR. LANDRETH Mm. 

00:22:50
KATE (inaudible ) 

00:22:56
DR. LANDRETH Hm, just gonna mix that up some.

DR. LANDRETH Just for your finger right there. 

00:28:40
DR. LANDRETH The living out of persistent patience and waiting for children to do things for themselves are perhaps the most crucial dimensions of play therapy. 

00:28:50
DR. LANDRETH Mhm. Right around that way you know how to put that on. There you got it on your finger.

KATE Five dollars. 

00:29:55
DR. LANDRETH Five dollars, sounds like you know the numbers. 

00:30:00
DR. LANDRETH We build children's self-esteem when we recognize or give them credit for knowing, doing or making something happen. Self-esteem is built in small increments. 

00:30:10
DR. LANDRETH ...all the way out. 

00:30:15

KATE There's my telephone. 

00:36:15
DR. LANDRETH Your telephone right there. Mhm. 

00:36:20
KATE Uh. (inaudible ) 

00:36:23
DR. LANDRETH I believe deeply in, and trust explicitly, the inner person of the child. Therefore my objective is to relate to the child in ways that will release the child's inner directional, creative, self-healing power. When I can live out this philosophical belief in the play room, children are empowered and their developmental capabilities are released for self-discovery, which results in constructive change. 

00:36:50
DR. LANDRETH And that one 

00:37:00
KATE Know what? My granny has a telephone and hers is white. 

00:37:05
DR. LANDRETH Oh she has one that looks like that only hers is white. Your grandmother's telephone.

DR. LANDRETH Mm. 

00:38:10
KATE I'll be right out. 

00:38:10
DR. LANDRETH I'll wait right here. 

00:38:15
DR. LANDRETH If the child is in the bathroom or has been playing out of sight behind the puppet theater for some time, I want to let the child know by some comment that I am still there. This avoids any possible anxiety from the child thinking I may have left the play room. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
DR. LANDRETH I can hear noises all the way out here. 

00:38:45

00:39:40
KATE Yeah. 

00:39:40
DR. LANDRETH Sometimes it does sound scary. Mm you're just squeezing that. 

00:39:50
