Autism and Intensive Interaction: 

00:00:05
Using body language to get in touch with children on the autistic spectrum 

00:00:05
Introduction 

00:00:20
MATT HOGHTON This is a film about how we can use a child's own body language to get into with children with autistic spectrum disorder using a technique called intensive interaction. 

00:00:25
Phoebe Caldwell Practitioner 

00:00:30
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe Caldwell a leading practitioner of intensive interaction visited the Vale of Evesham School for three days and worked with staff there to engage the children there to deal with some of the problems they encounter. 

00:00:40
Matt Hoghton General Practitioner 

00:00:45
MATT HOGHTON The film is divided into three parts. In the first part Phoebe and myself discuss the sensory difficulties these children experience and ways of engaging with them from moving from solitary self simulation into interaction. 

00:00:55
Penny Mytton Teacher 

00:01:00
MATT HOGHTON In the second part Phoebe discusses with one of the teachers at the school Penny Mytton. The use of touch and of body language in engaging creative conversation with these children. In the third part Phoebe engages with Jamie an 8-year old with autistic spectrum disorder. This an uncut film and shows Jamie moving from initial rejection to intimate interaction.

PART 1 

00:01:35
Sensory Distortions 

00:01:35
Using a child's body language to help them make sense of the world around them 

00:01:35
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe, children with autistic spectrum disorder seem to struggle with the world around them, making sense of it. Why is that? 

00:01:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, the sensory information coming in, they may come in perfectly normally through the eyes, ears, uh, through touch. But when it gets to the brain, once it comes to processing system everything starts to break up. And they don't see, feel, and hear in the same way that we do. At least they can't interpret it, the seeing, feeling, and hearing the way that we do. 

00:02:15
MATT HOGHTON So it's, it's an overload of information to them, is it? 

00:02:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL That's right. Everything is going much too fast, they can't process it, they can't put it in context. So you get a lot of these free floating images and the sounds, and they boom in and out. And uh, the images break up and. 

00:02:35
MATT HOGHTON What sort of, what sort of processes are involved in the brain that cause the problem? 

00:02:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well we think it's, there's evidence now that um, it may be that the autonomic nervous system is running riot. The child may feel that they're being attacked and respond accordingly. And this uh, storm, this autonomic storm is extremely painful, real physical pain. 

00:03:00
MATT HOGHTON So how does the child try to avoid this confusion and pain? 

00:03:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well trying to make sense of the world, they, what they want, what they're after is coherence so they can either retreat to a repetitive behavior. Which cuts down the amount of information coming in. Or you can try and cut down the source of the overload by putting wool over their head or running away. Or they can become aggressive either to themselves or to the world around them so they focus on, on the self aggression or they get rid of the source by hitting somebody and they run away. Always they trying to reduce the amount of sensory overload. 

00:03:45
MATT HOGHTON So that's the overriding feeling that they are trying to reduce that overload on them so they can reduce that pain. 

00:03:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, it's a self help technique in a way. So they can um, they don't have so much to process. They're not, they're not bottlenecking their processes, processing system. 

00:04:05
MATT HOGHTON So how, how would we help and make um, after this chaos and world they're in, existing in? How do we help them through this? 

00:04:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, we've got to feed in signals, try and feed in signals that have meaning for them which don't go, which don't overload the, the processing system. So we use their own body language which is sort of hard-wired in. And it's like having a smart code to get access into, uh. 

00:04:35
MATT HOGHTON Into talking. 

00:04:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uh, into, into their talking. Yes, that's right. Yes. Um, and in this way we can, they can, they can get signals which have meaning for them without having to uh, um, overload themselves. 

00:04:50
MATT HOGHTON So sensory difficulties very important for them isn't it? This sensory. 

00:04:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL I think, you know, we really need to be thinking of autism in terms of the sensory difficulties it process, um, it um, provides for, for children, adults. Um, and we need to be looking at how we can work with these um, and helping either to reduce the um, amount of, of um, stuff the brain can't deal with. And but at the same time to increase the signals that it can carry, uh, it can carry. 

00:05:30
[music] 

00:05:30
Finding Coherence 

00:05:35
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe, going back to the repetitive behavior, what, what do you mean by repetitive behaviors? 

00:05:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL It covers a very, very wide field actually from the least able who might be just flapping their hands or scratching their fingers um, to children who'll be watching Tomas, Thomas and Tank Engine or to um, children who get excessively interested in science fiction or trains. Or they may be lining up cars or they maybe or almost anything which lets the child when they're concentrating on it, on it they know what they're doing. And, um. 

00:06:15
MATT HOGHTON So, what's the function of this repetitive behavior? What? How does it work for the person, the child with autistic spectrum disorder? 

00:06:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL When you concentrate on something you're not hearing necessarily what's going on around you when you're really concentrating on something. And that's what it does for them. If they really, really focus on something then they don't have to take in and process all these um, confusing overload. And so, they're not in danger so much of going in fragmentation. So, if you stop a child doing a repetitive behavior you then expose them to the overload and fragmentation. 

00:06:45
MATT HOGHTON So this repetitive behavior is very important to you in, in ways of connecting with the children is it? 

00:06:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, and we're going to use the repetitive behavior as well as try to reduce them or eliminate them. Um, we're going to use them as uh, a way into um, interact with the children. When they do the repetitive behavior they know what they're doing. Um, and it's an activity the brain actually recognizes all the time. Um, and uh, you know, chaos then becomes reduced um, the sensory chaos becomes. 

00:07:25
MATT HOGHTON And the rhythm of the repetitive behavior is that important for them or isn't? 

00:07:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, the rhythms can be very important. Because quite often I actually tap into the rhythm rather than the actual behavior. Um. 

00:07:35
MATT HOGHTON So you use the timing of the behavior that they use rather than necessary. 

00:07:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Rather the behavior, sometimes, yes. Sometimes you'll actually copy um, and I usually start off with that. But then you start tune into the rhythms and it becomes a conversation rather than something um, an act. It becomes interaction. 

00:08:00
MATT HOGHTON So is there a pattern of behavior for them to have conversation with themselves or what? 

00:08:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes it is in a sense that the brain sends a message the uh, body uh, to the fingers and says so scratch. Um, and that gives feedback to the brain. It's that feedback that we're trying to tap into all the time, feedback they're giving themselves. So we use their body language in a sense in the way they're using the feedback they're giving themselves. 

00:08:30
MATT HOGHTON It must be very difficult to look at this repetitive behavior and to, to where do you start, Phoebe? Where do you start to connect with these people? 

00:08:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, I look not just at behavior but how they're doing it. So, for example, if it was just flicking that's that movement. But um, it's, "Ah!", that is the same movement but one of them tells me the chap, the child is relatively quiet at that stage. But the other tells us actually stand back because he's gonna blow at any minute. Um, he's very upset. Um, so how they do the behavior is very important. You're trying to tune into the emotional valiance of it um, as well as exactly what they're doing. 

00:09:15
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe has never seen any of these children before. This is the first meeting for each. First of all she's going to look and listen to each of the children to see what they're focusing on. And see what conversations they're having with themselves. At the same time she's also looking out for any sensations or stimuli that maybe affecting the children and causing them any distress. 

00:09:40
[music] 

00:09:40
Triggers to Distress 

00:09:40
Peter 

00:09:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Starting the sensory problems, meet Peter. Peter's hypersensitive to sound, he sticks his fingers in his ears, and that cuts down the input he's getting. 

00:10:00
Jack 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN We're trying to get. 

00:10:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL On the other hand Jack's hypersensitive to light. It hurts and squints up his eyes in response. 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:10
Sam 

00:10:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Periodically Sam goes rigid and stretches and extends his muscles. 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:20
Finely 

00:10:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Finley pokes around aimlessly in the toy box. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Finley 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL When this is removed he rocks giving himself a jerk, It appears he is experiencing psededuo(ph) which balance distortions. 

00:10:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL I can't do it here. I'll hold it so you can. 

00:10:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL So he gives himself a signal that his brain can interpret easily and the world begins to make sense for him. Some children find people difficult. They present too much in the way of stimulus. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN What have you done? 

00:11:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Not only does the brain have to make sense of the changing shapes and movements but they also make sounds that do not have meaning for the child. 

00:11:10
Jake 

00:11:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Jake finds being close to people very difficult. Here he's squeezing around me bending his body away. 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Good, go in. 

00:11:30
[music] 

00:11:30
Constructing an Autism Friendly Environment 

00:11:30
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe it looks like we need to create an autism friendly environment for these children. How do we go about that? 

00:11:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, the overwriting um, consideration is to produce an environment which makes sense to them without having to overload the processing system. So we'll be trying to reduce the signals which they find difficult to process and increase the input which they can process naturally. 

00:12:10
MATT HOGHTON Can you give me some examples of how we can do this? 

00:12:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well we're gonna be looking at the language that they're using to talk to themselves. So the feedback that they're using to talk themselves, so um, it might be flapping the hands or scratching their fingers. But we're going to find out what it is that has significance for them, there for their brain and use that to correspond with them to, to make a conversation. 

00:12:35
MATT HOGHTON So the language they're using, each person uses a unique language. Is that right? 

00:12:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely, yes. And it's that, that we're going to use to get access to uh, their world without um, overloading. 

00:12:55
[music] 

00:12:55
Communication 

00:12:55
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe we often see children with autistic spectrum disorder as separate and uncommunicative, is that the case? 

00:13:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well no, it's not the case and they do love people, they do feel lonely. They feel these things but what they can't handle is the feedback they're getting from their own bodies. 

00:13:10
MATT HOGHTON So it's the feedback from their own bodies which is stopping them from engaging with us, is it? 

00:13:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, the feelings of emotional overload um, can be acutely painful. What I might say, you know, nice chap smiling at me. They might feel as sort of avalanche of, of sensations which uh, can be really agonizing. Um, so they don't want to go there. 

00:13:40
MATT HOGHTON So how do we help get in touch with them. We really try to line ourselves with how they feel. Um, we'll use their body language. Well we're watching their body language all the time. We watch our own body language all the time. Um, but in this respect for example if a chap, if a child is tapping their head, um, that's one thing. But they might be, smack, smacking their head same movement but one of them tells them they're relatively all right at the minute. Uh, the other says, you know, I'm, I'm really having, I'm in big trouble and. 

00:14:10
MATT HOGHTON So the communication, give me some idea how distress they are. 

00:14:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uh, it tells us how distressed they are, when they're happy. Um, and in fact when we watch our own body language we're monitoring it to see how each other feels. And we do this when we're talking to people with autism with nonverbal language. 

00:14:30
MATT HOGHTON So in a way you're moving from functional communication to try and get some emotional engagement with them. 

00:14:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely, yes that's it, it. Quite right. Yes. 

00:14:40
Using Body Language 

00:14:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL In the following intervention I'll be using tact as one of the channels of communications. Later on Penny and I will be having a discussion about the appropriateness of losing touch. 

00:14:50
Sam 

00:14:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Sam's not getting strong enough messages from his nerves and muscles to the brain. Periodically he gives himself powerful muscular stimuli by extending his arms and legs until they're rigid. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL I try using light touch but he flinches. 

00:15:55
[sil.] 

00:15:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL But it works later on when I use firm pressure. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:17:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL And again. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah, Ah! Phoebe. Phoebe. It's not a joke. Phoebe. 

00:17:35
SAM Ah! 

00:17:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah! Phoebe. 

00:17:40
SAM Phoebe. 

00:17:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Phoebe, good. Phoebe. Phoebe. Ah! Phoebe. Phoebe. 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah, ah. 

00:18:15
SAM Ah. 

00:18:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah. Phoebe. 

00:18:20
SAM Phoe. 

00:18:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Phoebe, good. Phoebe. 

00:18:20
SAM Good. 

00:18:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Good, yes. Good. 

00:18:25
SAM Good. 

00:18:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Good, good. Phoe, Phoebe. 

00:18:30
SAM Oh, where. 

00:18:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oh, where. Now as suddenly we get this. Now, now is he, is he by any chance got epilepsy? 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN No. 

00:18:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL No. Because there's a very dramatic change cognitively. Does this normally happen that he goes into spasms. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN I mean when he sometimes. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN Yes, when he. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN He might know. 

00:18:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL You never over stimulate him. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:18:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, I think that's probably enough anyway. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:19:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Thank you very much indeed. 

00:19:00
Peter 

00:19:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Peter's very withdrawn. The stimulus he's giving himself is through wiggling his feet. Peter has problems with sound presumably. We need to be quiet, don't we Peter. 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Unknown. 

00:19:20
[sil.] 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Then choose. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Chose. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Twin colors. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Two colors. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN Blue. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN May I have three colors. Stop, stop, stop. I'll walk all three together. Sure. 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN Around this way. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Sam, choose. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN How many can you see? 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN All right, Sam is out again. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN This one? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL The further away it is from the brain Joe (inaudible ) said the further away it is from brain. The most you can come with is touch. Peter, Peter thank you. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN He clearly quite likes that. 

00:20:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. How 'bout this one. Peter, thank you. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Should we do it again, Peter. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Thank you. Oh, oh. Be careful, the book. Thank you. 

00:21:15
Scott 

00:21:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Where a child's giving himself feedback in the form of physical pressure it may not be enough to accurately back visually what they're doing. Scott bites and chews jigsaw puzzle pieces placing pressure on his lips and teeth. He's not interested when he sees that I'm doing the same. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL So in order to give him a signal that his brain is likely to relate to I enhance the feedback he's given himself by using vibration in the area of his mouth. And I ask his teaching assistant to introduce the vibrator slowly by placing it on the back of a chair near his head. And um, it's actually relieved by chewing, a vibration. But you. Eventually he smiles and holds the vibrator. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:25
Finley 

00:22:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL When we come to Finley we're using his rocking to get in touch with him. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Let's try and hold it a bit. Ooh! Ooh. And again. We want to build up the tension, the extended hand. Ooh. Ooh! 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh! 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh! Now we want to if we can get him to make a sound first. Now. Ah! Ah! Ooh! Ooh. Ooh, ugh. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh, ooh. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
PENNY MYTTON Ah! 

00:24:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. Ooh. Ah, ooh. How is that really with him? 

00:24:35
PENNY MYTTON Just, just concentrating on, on what he was doing. And. 

00:24:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL So, focusing in towards. 

00:24:40
PENNY MYTTON The focus in to, into him. And being really aware of what he was doing, how he was doing it and. 

00:24:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL And what that said about how he felt. 

00:24:50
PENNY MYTTON Yes. How uh, how. 

00:24:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes. 

00:24:50
PENNY MYTTON Just listening to him. 

00:24:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, listening in the sense that one listens with all one's senses. 

00:24:55
PENNY MYTTON I see completely. 

00:24:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL I think I would look to, you know using as I say, a swing and trampoline. 

00:25:00
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:25:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Because, because of this um, he really likes that jolt. 

00:25:05
PENNY MYTTON And that makes him sort of center himself does it? The, he. 

00:25:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes. It is what he's doing when he, when he gives himself a jolt. I, uh, if you're, you're the stimulus your body system is all over the place. If you give your, you know you're giving yourself a jolt. 

00:25:25
PENNY MYTTON And then you. 

00:25:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL It actually. 

00:25:25
PENNY MYTTON Centers you back. 

00:25:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Helps centers you. And really this is part of what we call center integration and it's another part of what we do to try and bring signals which the body understands. So, we're not only giving them um, physical stimuli and we're also giving them uh, stimulant brain. 

00:25:40
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:25:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Can take onboard immediately which taps into their behavior. 

00:25:45
PENNY MYTTON So, and so because they feel centered and because the balance is right then they're able to. 

00:25:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Then they're more able to connect. 

00:25:50
PENNY MYTTON To, to focus on. 

00:25:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah, that's right. 

00:25:55
PENNY MYTTON What's happening in somebody else. 

00:25:55
Olly 

00:26:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Olly finds it very difficult to join in anything. And he wanders about randomly. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL But I start to use the breathing rhythm, particularly the rhythm of his breathing rhythm. And he begins to take notice almost immediately. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN It's like. 

00:27:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL It was quite. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN I've never seen Oliver do that. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN And you might get the eye contact. We don't get the touching. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN The touching of the face. 

00:27:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL The touching. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN It's quite extraordinary. Yeah. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL It started with the sound actually. And he did like having that blowing in his ear like. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN It's as if his face is lifting. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN The stress is. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN He's so happy. 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN He's so relaxed. Look at his face all the lines are gone. 

00:28:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well you're gonna enjoy doing this aren't you? 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN With a response like that will we. 

00:28:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL You will be able to. All you need is a technique. It's not just me. 

00:29:00
PENNY MYTTON The three girls, the, the assistants that are working with him at the moment were amazed at the level of interaction. And just the way he, he went from, from being a young man who very rarely gives eye contact. Really doesn't want to be near anybody kept coming back to you, kept coming back and asking you for, you know, the, the. 

00:29:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Taking my hand and doing it. 

00:29:25
PENNY MYTTON Taking your hand and the beaming smile. 

00:29:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:29:30
PENNY MYTTON It, was it, it, it you know, actually what, what Emma said to me that it was very emotional. And it was. 

00:29:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL And she could see that it is. 

00:29:35
PENNY MYTTON And it was, it was wonderful. 

00:29:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely amazing. 

00:29:35
PENNY MYTTON It really was. I've never seen Olly want to be with anybody that much. 

00:29:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL What I was doing actually was he, he breath holds a bit. 

00:29:50
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:29:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL I realized after a bit and it was when I started blowing in his ear and tuning into his breath holding rhythm that he really started to get interested. And say started to come back with um, for more. And then Olly he was taking my hand and putting arms around me, my arms around him. And I was pressing for his breathing, breathing at the same time as making the sound. And he wanted it blown in his ear and so forth. I, I've come across this before where people are breath holding. If you tap into that rhythm because it's so much an essential part of their life all the time this is the thing that they really, really flick on to. And uh, he is, he was just entranced, wasn't he? 

00:30:35
PENNY MYTTON Yes. Yeah, it was, it was absolutely wonderful to be part of that. It really was. I think it was a real boost for all of us to see, you know that change from that to that. 

00:30:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah, it was a dramatic change. 

00:30:45
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, it was. Really worked. 

00:30:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL I know you've worked with Olly in the afternoon and um, you know, how what, what effect did it have? 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN Uh, took him out because we had, had to do the washing up with him. So it was just the two of us. And I started doing the breathing in his ear and sort of echoing his breathing. 

00:31:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN And he turned round and grabbed both my upper arms and I looked deep into my eyes and then he just gave me a huge squeezy hug. Which he's I've never seen him do that and he'd never did it to me not, not like that. And I, it's just breathe taking really that's the only word I can, it's more than amazing. It's just something, it's as if he says finally you are talking to me. 

00:31:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL It's absolutely right, isn't it. Yes. And you were saying, I think you were saying that this morning he was, um. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN His eye contact, yes. His eye contact today. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN All day. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN In fact today, he's been absolutely fantastic. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN And he walked in with a huge smile in his face, which is unusual. 

00:31:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Did he expect. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:31:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL You suddenly made the bridge and once the bridge is open. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL With some people it'll stay open you just have to keep on tapping into. You haven't cured the autism. What you've done is you've made it a world which he can actually cross into. It's untellable um, because we'd been using um, his, his signs and he, he the, the part of his uh, his nonverbal language to communicate with him. So, thank you, it's great. It's lovely to hear that you're able to carry it on. Uh, some people feel silly um, trying to do this and that's when they're thinking about, we're thinking about. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Ourselves. 

00:32:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ourselves and not the person we're working with. And it's just getting over that. And um, censoring ourselves right in, in, in the language and the world of the person. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN I think that's, I, I'm German and I've learned obviously English, another languages and it's always this first hurdle of feeling really silly. And imitating somebody's intonation. 

00:32:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Intonation, yeah. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN In any language and you feel really silly cuz it sounds like a toy language in Swedish or something. 

00:32:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN But you've got to do it to be. 

00:33:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL So you have to sink yourself in them, right. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Sink yourself, yes. 

00:33:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Than thinking about your own feelings. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN How you feel because it doesn't matter how you feel. 

00:33:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN In that. If you want to understand and communicate you have to think about the other person. 

00:33:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL And this is the language, this is the language they're brain is familiar with. Um, they can't process easily the sounds, the movements, and stuff that comes in. Um, and only the things which are actually part of the own personal physical repertoire. So you're always looking at what feedback does this person give themselves. How are they talking to themselves. That is language that they um, use and we have to tap into that. And you're quite right it is like learning a, a language which is not one's first language. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL I have the same problem with French. Never really got over it in my case. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. You just feel completely real tiny really. 

00:33:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes. That's right. That's absolutely. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN At first but then you get used to it. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN But it's when you get the reaction back. 

00:33:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL When you get the reaction back you see the. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN You forget everything. 

00:33:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oh my god, you sure do. Absolutely. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN It doesn't matter what you what I look like. 

00:33:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely, it doesn't matter what I, I forget about it completely about what the world thinks about me once you get that link in with, um. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN It's far valuable. I also found interesting yesterday and that was new to me when you did the interaction with him. What I learned before, knew before about intensive interaction was copying and mimicking. 

00:34:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN And we've been kind of you know, frantically been trying to twiddle. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, twiddle. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Like Olly does and do everything that they do and just copy. Were's your approach is I don't know it's like an echo more? 

00:34:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL No, it's answering really. A responding rather than um, actually mimicking. But also you may, your quite right, you may have to go through a number of different things before you hit the right. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, but not all of at once. 

00:34:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Element. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN We'd tried everything all at once, didn't we. We were rocking and twiddling at the same time and you know. 

00:34:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uh, actually with him it's the breathing rhythm. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Which is. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN And we never even thought of trying the breathing, really had we. Not so. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN No, we, we'd always had the pant but then. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Not full blown, yeah. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN We stop. 

00:34:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL But it is that he actually breathe holds. And if you get a child who breathe holds you can almost always tap into that. Um, it's just, just a trick of the trade in a way that they, that's the one which is dominates their lives. That's the thing that constantly um, aware of inside. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN He's a lot more vocal now, isn't he. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN See, it's, it's completely amazing. 

00:35:20
Charlie 

00:35:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL So far, we've been looking at children of had intensive interaction used with them. Some of the children in Penny's class already have had experience of intensive interaction. When Charlie's not doing anything particularly he sits on a spinning chair and plays with a length of string. When he focused on this he knows what he's doing. Penny's now gonna show us some of the work she's been doing with Charlie. 

00:35:55
[sil.] 

00:35:55
PENNY MYTTON I just. 

00:35:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL You still want to keep contact. 

00:35:55
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:35:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Where. 

00:35:55
PENNY MYTTON He so definite with go. 

00:36:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL I say, I say what are you doing with. 

00:36:35
PENNY MYTTON Okay. 

00:36:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL So you actually make it more your body language to, to. 

00:36:40
PENNY MYTTON So, I'm still open. 

00:36:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL You're still on your. 

00:36:45
PENNY MYTTON Accessible to him. 

00:36:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, exactly. Is that, you're making the negative be a part of the conversation. 

00:36:50
PENNY MYTTON I can, yes. 

00:36:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Rather than just. 

00:36:50
PENNY MYTTON Retreating and making myself unavailable anymore. 

00:36:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, exactly. Complete availability. 

00:36:55
PENNY MYTTON Right. 

00:36:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL And that part of it, what, basically what you're saying is that better. 

00:37:00
PENNY MYTTON I, yeah. I, I think, I think that's something we all find collective. 

00:37:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN Because quite often certainly there's children in the class as well, who, who refuses or objects. 

00:37:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, that's right. 

00:37:10
PENNY MYTTON And, and you never know. 

00:37:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL So you break off, so you don't break off just with, just open yourself and withdraw a bit. 

00:37:20
PENNY MYTTON Right. So. 

00:37:20
Jonathon 

00:37:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Moving on to Jonathon, Penny has an interesting conversation with his hands. 

00:37:30
[sil.] 

00:37:30
PENNY MYTTON That's your cheek. That's your cheek. 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:30
PENNY MYTTON That's your cheek. 

00:38:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL You do the other one so he can get, the other cheek. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:45
PENNY MYTTON My chin. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:15
PENNY There's his nose. 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:20
PENNY MYTTON Nose, cheek, chin. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Okay. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:45
PART 2 

00:39:45
A conversation between Penny Mytton & Phoebe Caldwell 

00:39:45
1- Age appropriateness and use of touch 

00:39:45
2- Using Intensive interaction with a disturbed child 

00:39:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL One of the problems is that you know, it may all be very well with little children. People begin to wonder if it's age appropriate. 

00:40:00
PENNY MYTTON Yes. 

00:40:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL With the older children. And uh, cuz they may even feel that it may be inducing feeling which are inappropriate. The overriding thing is does this make a child, uh, difference to a quality of a child's life. And curiously enough it doesn't seem to arise inappropriate. 

00:40:20
PENNY MYTTON Absolutely. 

00:40:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL I don't think I've ever experienced that. 

00:40:25
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, similarly, yeah I work with the slightly older age group and certainly with several of the pupils in my class touch is the way they are asking to be communicated. They are communicating through it themselves. And to, to, to not respond to the touch I feel we wouldn't be getting the results. 

00:40:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:40:50
PENNY MYTTON That we've been getting. Certainly, you know, the work we've been doing this morning um, it made such a difference. When you patted him on the back, it was an instant, "Ah!" 

00:41:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL It gets a response, yes. 

00:41:05
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:41:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Um, it's, if we don't, if we don't use touch we're rejecting them basically. 

00:41:10
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:41:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL We're saying we're not listening. The one thing that is actually meaningful for you, to your brain I'm not going to do it because. 

00:41:20
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:41:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL And in order to, but in order to be able to do it we do need to have a strategy of what is permissible. Do we have to have all the people present? 

00:41:25
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:41:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Do we do it on our end. Obviously with things like sounds you can just say, "Huh!", you know. And, and respond to their breathing rhythm. It's not quite as simple with touch. 

00:41:35
PENNY MYTTON No. 

00:41:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL And yet most of the pro-, what is profound results you get are actually using touch. 

00:41:45
PENNY MYTTON Using touch, yeah. 

00:41:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL And this is because so many of them respond. They're so low on properception. They desperately need that properceptive um, stimulus in order to get through to them. Sometime you may using it as part of a package so to speak. So you would use the child's sounds, but you will also echo the, the sounds by pressure. And as we were doing this morning. 

00:42:10
PENNY MYTTON Uh, yes. 

00:42:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Where um. 

00:42:10
PENNY MYTTON And making the sound and using the hands at the same time. And that makes sense. 

00:42:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely. 

00:42:15
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:42:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL And it sort of emphasis, if you put it in two modes then it seems to rein-, make it easier for them to process. If you put the signal in, in two modes it seems to make it the actual message. 

00:42:30
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:42:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Gets through um, more easily. And one can be creative with it. And one may answer sound with touch or um, touch with the sound. But it's the interplay of these different signals which so creative and so exciting. And it's this slight difference which actually captures their attention. These, you get attention when you copy them. 

00:42:50
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:42:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL But you get engagement and coming back for more when they start to feel the whole play of the senses. 

00:43:00
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, and it wouldn't be a conversation if you didn't respond to everything they were saying to you. 

00:43:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely, it would be the same. 

00:43:05
PENNY MYTTON So if you rejected the touch then. 

00:43:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

00:43:05
PENNY MYTTON It would no longer be a conversation. Once again all the control would be with the, the adult part as it were and then you've lost the conversation. 

00:43:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely. 

00:43:15
PENNY MYTTON The child has no control of you know, they're not empowered by their own conversation. Which is what we want. 

00:43:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL And what you see is the joy. 

00:43:25
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. Yes. 

00:43:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL It's so evident. I think almost everybody we worked with. 

00:43:30
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:43:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Um, this is extraordinary pleasure at last you're getting it right. 

00:43:35
PENNY MYTTON Yes. 

00:43:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL A relief, you know. 

00:43:35
PENNY MYTTON You're listening to me and you're talking to me in words I can understand. 

00:43:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL In which are meaningful, not words but in, in modes that I can understand. 

00:43:45
PENNY MYTTON Yes. 

00:43:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL And we can have a conversation. 

00:43:45
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:43:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL With each other. 

00:43:45
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. And that's, we're seeing that even certainly for one of the youngsters we work with on Monday and Tuesday the staff is saying he's doing it in the corridor and that. 

00:43:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL He is. 

00:43:55
PENNY MYTTON Is amazing. 

00:44:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL That and walking around and asking people. 

00:44:00
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, asking people to do it. 

00:44:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL So it's frustrating is it. 

00:44:00
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

00:44:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Waiting for them to respond. 

00:44:05
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, and it's lovely. 

00:44:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL It's absolutely amazing. 

00:44:05
PENNY MYTTON It's just lovely. Yeah. 

00:44:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL And the staff is so excited. 

00:44:10
PENNY MYTTON Yes, really excited. It's, it's made, it's really brought it home to a lot of us that you know, it, it works. And not only in um, in you know an interactive, let's have a conversation sort of way. Certainly yesterday when one of my youngsters was having difficulties I found that by doing what we've been doing the last few days. By starting conversation I managed to calm the youngster down as well. 

00:44:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL So he was really getting quite agitated? 

00:44:45
PENNY MYTTON He was very, very distressed. He was shouting, he was running wildly, thrashing, um. 

00:44:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL And what you did was you took the? 

00:44:55
PENNY MYTTON I took the noises as you'd said and rather than. 

00:45:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Do sounds. 

00:45:00
PENNY MYTTON Yes, sounds. Rather than uh, um, copying what he was doing or you know, leading on from that I brought it down. 

00:45:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Okay, so when he went, "Ah!", you. 

00:45:10
PENNY MYTTON I, "ah". And he stopped and then he went off and did, did some more of the sort of angry. And it was almost as though, Okay come on then. 

00:45:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL See if. 

00:45:25
PENNY MYTTON Give us some more, let's see. And I, and I carried on bringing it down and within it must have been 45 seconds. 

00:45:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL He was down. 

00:45:30
PENNY MYTTON He was sitting next to me and we were playing, playing like this. And he was ready to go back into class. Whereas under other circumstances, you know, youngsters can be distressed and upset for hours. 

00:45:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, that's right. 

00:45:45
PENNY MYTTON You know it can be. 

00:45:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Then they don't come back. 

00:45:50
PENNY MYTTON It can ruin the rest of the day. 

00:45:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL The trouble is the more you try to tell them to be quiet and to sit down and so forth, you're using words which are difficult to process. And therefore it actually increases the problem. 

00:46:00
PENNY MYTTON It increases stress. 

00:46:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Rather than, increases the stress rather than uh, um, brings it down. 

00:46:05
PENNY MYTTON And it, it, it was quite, it was a revelation. He, I've never seen him. 

00:46:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Come back like that before. 

00:46:10
PENNY MYTTON And it was, it was relief. He was relieved, he was absolutely relieved that he didn't have to carry on doing it. 

00:46:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yes, he was being brought out of his um, his distress. 

00:46:25
PENNY MYTTON Yeah! 

00:46:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uh, by switching his attention from the tantrum that was going on in there to the um, uh, fact that there was something he would recognize outside. This was all a swirly. Actually people talk about terror. 

00:46:40
PENNY MYTTON Yes, yes. 

00:46:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL And um, that's when, when kids with autism are upset it's because they are essentially overloaded and they get frightened. 

00:46:50
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, it's the fragmentation that's there. 

00:46:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL They get terribly frightened and everything breaks up. And these outburst are actually response to fear and overload. Um, and when they hear something outside themselves which they recognize it shifts their attention. It's not about, oh, we're spoiling them all or you know we're um, uh, we're pandering them or whatever. It's about this child is distressed we can use his sounds to sure, or his touch use um, to shift their attention to the world outside. And that brings them down. 

00:47:25
PENNY MYTTON Cuz nothing positive can happen while they're. 

00:47:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely not. 

00:47:30
PENNY MYTTON In that disjointed, completely you know, distressed state, state it can't, they can't go anywhere from that except. 

00:47:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Absolutely. 

00:47:40
PENNY MYTTON Up. And you know, if it, I did, it just amazed me. 

00:47:40
PART 3 

00:47:40
An uncut intervention with Jamie 

00:47:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Jamie needs to know what's happening. When he's upset he lays on the floor, kicking, punching out, scratching. He has a lazy eye this can cause vision distortions which may account for his falling over occasionally. It's the end of the day and I've just looked into his classroom. Jamie pushes me away and then he takes my hand and leads me to the door, leaning against me trying to get me out. So we know that he can show us when he wants to get rid of me. 

00:48:20
[sil.] 

00:48:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL He wants a sound that's slightly different as though you, and also move him slightly. 

00:48:35
[sil.] 

00:48:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Because of the way Jamie bangs himself with the skittle I decided to enhance the signal he's using to bang himself by using vibration. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN One gets traded off for that one. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Please. 

00:48:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL The following day Jamie wonders around the classroom clutching the vibration unit. Although he makes little response to me at least he doesn't try and push me away which we know he could do if he was unhappy with my presence. But even knowing this it does feel uncomfortable to be ignored let alone rejected. 

00:49:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Right, see if you can get. 

00:49:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL This is a difficult bit and it's sometimes quite hard to continue. I need to sharpen my attention to prevent loss concentration. Is there any change in behavior, any increase in or decrease in eye contact, or are there any sounds? Are his movements calming or do I feel he's becoming agitated. Can I come closer or should I ease off. One of the problems with using equipment of any kind is that the child and sometimes his teacher will become so absorbed in this that it excludes personal interaction. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:49:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Here Jamie shows a fleeting interest in the vibrator that I'm holding but he's not interested in me as a person. He pulls away. 

00:50:25
JAMIE Ah! 

00:50:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Back to exploring his own. 

00:50:30
[sil.] 

00:51:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL I need some batteries. 

00:51:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Jamie continues to patrol his classroom. Seven minutes seems a long time when one doesn't know if one's approach is the right one or not. Is this going to work or not. At least he's not showing signs of unhappiness or trying to get rid of me. Which we know he can do because last night he finally pushed me out of the door. 

00:51:40
[sil.] 

00:51:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL That's right. Yes, if he makes any sound. Ooh, Ooh! 

00:51:55
JAMIE Hi. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:52:00
[sil.] 

00:52:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah. 

00:52:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Jamie starts now to make sounds. Each time he makes one, I answer it. Because I want him to know that when he makes an initiative he'll get a response. 

00:52:50
MATT HOGHTON Ooh, ooh. 

00:52:50
JAMIE Ooh. 

00:52:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. Ah! Eee. Ooh. 

00:53:00
JAMIE Ooh. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Ooh. 

00:53:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL And I'm watching now to see if his sounds will move from being just self directed utterances to interactive responses. His eye contact virtually increases. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN You want two voices or just one? 

00:53:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL It doesn't matter actually. I've done that. So I find it difficult not to respond. Ah! And you can do it when he doesn't do it as well sometimes. Say when you initiate you kick start the thing, sometimes. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Ee, ooh. 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN Ee, ooh. 

00:53:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh! 

00:53:40
JAMIE Eee! 

00:53:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:45
JAMIE Ooh. 

00:54:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Aah. 

00:54:00
JAMIE Aaee. 

00:54:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah! So vary the sound quite a lot. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:54:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Um, Ah!. 

00:54:05
JAMIE Eeoo. 

00:54:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee! If you can get the feeling of him too, that's, that's good. So, I should uh, stand, standing. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:54:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL When you say to him. 

00:54:20
JAMIE Eee! 

00:54:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee! 

00:54:20
JAMIE Eee! 

00:54:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee! Eee! 

00:54:25
JAMIE Eee, eee! 

00:54:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee, eee, eee! Eee! 

00:54:25
JAMIE Eee! Eee! 

00:54:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee, eee, eee! 

00:54:30
JAMIE Eee, eee. 

00:54:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. Ooh. Ooh! 

00:54:40
JAMIE Ooh! 

00:54:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. 

00:54:45
JAMIE Ooh. 

00:54:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oooh. 

00:54:55
JAMIE Aaah. 

00:54:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah. 

00:55:00
[sil.] 

00:55:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Interesting that his sounds are increased when his attention is uh, when he's actually focused on the vibration. It's almost you need that focus in order to be able to interact with sound. But you need to do the sounds as loud, quite loudly actually. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:55:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL To get him. Ah! Normally I would say don't hype-, hyper try that but with him he doesn't really respond. Ah! 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Aaee. 

00:55:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Woo! 

00:55:35
[sil.] 

00:55:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL And then he learns how to switch the vibrator on and off. This is my opportunity to get in his conversation with himself. Each time he uses the switch I say a surprises "Ooh!" using his sounds in synchrony with his movement. 

00:55:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. Oooh! Oooh. 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN Ooh. 

00:56:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Very few, here, here, hits himself sometime. You just got to be so totally centered in what he says or do. You absolutely take what they do, you're responding to all the time. So you're so almost in them. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oo-ooh. Oh! Oooh. Oooh!. 

00:56:30
JAMIE Aah! 

00:56:35
[sil.] 

00:56:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh, ah! Uuh. Uh.

PHOEBE CALDWELL You recognize hardly every time he comes past pretty well. Ah! Ah! 

00:57:25
JAMIE Ah, aaah. 

00:57:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ah, aaah. 

00:57:35

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Aah. 

00:57:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Aah! Aaah. Aaah. Ah! Aah, aah. aaah. Ooh. Ooh. Oooh. I'm going to get a little closer. Oooh!

PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Ooh-oh. Ooh. 

01:00:10
JAMIE Eee. 

01:00:10
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. He starts to mimic what I'm doing to what he's doing and he settles down and comes closer. His body language relaxes. Ooh. Oooh. Oh. Oooh. Oooh. Ooh. Ooh! Ooh! 

01:00:50
JAMIE Eee. 

01:00:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. Oh! Ooh! Oh!

PHOEBE CALDWELL Aah. Aah! Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 

01:02:25
[sil.] 

01:02:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL He realizes he can control what I do and looking at me he synchronizes his sound with my anticipated response. 

01:02:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. 

01:02:35
JAMIE Oooh! 

01:02:40

01:04:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Eee! 

01:04:05
[sil.] 

01:04:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL He offers a number of different ways interacting. And he's interested in my responses. 

01:04:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Oh. 

01:04:20
[sil.] 

01:04:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. OOh. Oh. Ah. Move this chair which is really a pain. Ah! Ooh! Aah.

01:06:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uuh. Uuh. Aah. Aah. Ooh. 

01:06:35
[sil.] 

01:06:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Aah. 

01:07:25
[sil.] 

01:07:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL Near the end he very clearly copies my hand movement. Something that people with autism are not suppose to be able to do. 

01:07:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Ooh. 

01:07:50
[sil.] 

01:07:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Our interactions build up into a conversation of increasing pleasure and intimacy for both of us. 

01:08:00
[sil.] 

01:08:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL I get no more warning. Perhaps we better. Uh, he also ** from but didn't do, use of his sound. First we got, first we got a bit of eye contact, then we got gradual increase in his sounds. And then he started to actually do them and listen for a response. 

01:08:45
PENNY MYTTON Yes. And then you could see what he wanted specific sounds as well. And, and then he. 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN That's right. 

01:08:55
PENNY MYTTON Responding with the sound he. 

01:08:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL And actually he was copying. 

01:08:55
PENNY MYTTON Yes, he was. 

01:08:55
PHOEBE CALDWELL And not again autistic children are not suppose to be able to copy. 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:09:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL Uh, he'd been copying quite a lot. 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN He has. 

01:09:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL And particular he's been doing sounds and waiting for me to do them. Getting me to copy him as well. It's been a two-way process. 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN And from the other day. 

01:09:10
PENNY MYTTON When he just. 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN He wasn't using sound at all. 

01:09:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL No, that's right. 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN It was all. 

01:09:15
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

01:09:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL He wants a touch, I'm going to rub. ** family not likely. Uh, a light touch can actually be a problem. 

01:09:25
UNKNOWN Right, okay. 

01:09:25
PHOEBE CALDWELL No, I mean really firm. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN About so? 

01:09:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Press, pressing rather than. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Pressing. 

01:09:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN Still? 

01:09:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Yeah. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN Up and down his chin? 

01:09:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well slowly, just, just press hard. It's pressure. And if he stops just take it off. 

01:09:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:09:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL So that's another way of doing it. If he stops take it off. And he, now put it on again. Yes, but he's doing this so do. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN So then. 

01:10:00
[sil.] 

01:10:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Now stop and then keep your hand on. And then if he turns it off that's right, take your hand away. Do you see there's all sorts of different ways. 

01:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:10:15
PHOEBE CALDWELL You can do it. 

01:10:20
[sil.] 

01:10:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL You want to get him to press the thing to get you. 

01:10:30
[sil.] 

01:10:30
PHOEBE CALDWELL He wants you to tap him. 

01:10:40
[sil.] 

01:10:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL He needs to know that every time he does something he gets an answer. Which is. 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:10:50
PHOEBE CALDWELL Significant. 

01:10:55
JAMIE Aaah! 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN Aaah. 

01:11:00
[sil.] 

01:11:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL I definitely would. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:11:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Firm pressure is absolutely critical. Light pressure can feel like a whole den of spiders running out of your skin, they say. And you know, firm pressure is definitely all, with all autistic children firm pressure is better than light. 

01:11:25
[sil.] 

01:11:25
PENNY MYTTON It' seems so logical when I see it work. 

01:11:35
PHOEBE CALDWELL You're always putting in signals which are significant. 

01:11:40
PENNY MYTTON Yeah. 

01:11:40
PHOEBE CALDWELL And so the brain doesn't have to go through processing and so they know. He's orchestrating it now. 

01:11:50
PENNY MYTTON Yes, absolutely. 

01:11:55
[music] 

01:11:55
PENNY MYTTON He's just excited and happy and. 

01:12:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL He seems all right, doesn't he? 

01:12:00
PENNY MYTTON Yeah, he does. 

01:12:00
PHOEBE CALDWELL I'm (crosstalk) it is for you two isn't it? 

01:12:05
PENNY MYTTON Yes. 

01:12:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL As he has pleasure by it with certain sounds. 

01:12:10
[music] 

01:12:10
What difference does Intensive Interaction make? 

01:12:15
MATT HOGHTON So what difference does using a child's body language make? 

01:12:20
PHOEBE CALDWELL As soon as they start to recognize the inputs they're getting and recognize every time they do something they will get a response. They start to relax. This is quite visible. You can see it on the face every child we videoed. And once they start to relax the brain seems to work more effectively. And you get an increase in eye contact, and attention, social responsiveness. Um, sometimes they can generalize within the limits of their learning disability if there's one uh, present. Um, they move closer to you. They'll introduce new material. They'll smile and laugh. 

01:13:00
MATT HOGHTON So, how is some of the other behavior effect it? 

01:13:05
PHOEBE CALDWELL Almost all difficult to manage behavior is reduced uh, within the limits the difficulties the sensory difficulties they're having. So, this is why it's important to try and re-, base reduce those sensory difficulties and distortions, as well as increasing the inputs which have meaning for them. Sometimes they'll even start to use speech if they have it. Uh, it emerges once the brain is freed up. 

01:13:40
MATT HOGHTON So how do we create meaning in the lives of these children? 

01:13:45
PHOEBE CALDWELL Well, we're so desperate to force them into our world that we're not always thinking about what it has significance for their brain. We have to use language which has meaning for them. And while intensive interaction is not a cure for autism it does offer us a way of bringing calm to their lives and meaning. And helping us and them to enjoy the world that we share. 

01:14:15
MATT HOGHTON Phoebe thank you very much.
