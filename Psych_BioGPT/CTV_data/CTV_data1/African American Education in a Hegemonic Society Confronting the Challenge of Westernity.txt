MOLEFI KETE ASANTE  I thought maybe I should leave because, ah, what can I do now? (laughs) I mean, ah, thank you so much Dr. Constantine. Ah, it's always good to be at the Winter Roundtable. Uhm, and I, I was, I've been here, I think this is my third time. But, I didn't start early. So, it's not the 25 years I, I was later than that, but, I have always enjoyed coming here. It's one of the places where, you know, I, I come to the Winter Roundtable because, ah, these, you are the people that give me sustenance. Uhm, I, I feel comfortable here. Ah, there are many, ah, places where you speak where you don't quite feel that they're your people, you know, you, you, you, you're there, but you know that it's, it's difficult. With you, I have a sense that, uhm, the things that I talk about, you will probably already know something about or you will be, ah, eager to, ah, hear. Ah, and that's wonderful. I mean, to speak it feels good in a place like that. It's like you may not need me here, but, I, I need you. I need to be here with you. So, were gonna have a wonderful time this morning. And I wanna thank again, ah, Dr. Madonna Constantine. She is, ah, ah, dynamic, ah, ah, brilliant, ah, leader, and she has done a magnificent job for these five years. Ah, and I just want us to give her another round of applause. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, hmm. You know, uhm, I wanna talk about broken memory, broken memory. And I wanna start by saying that urban education, that is the, the education in the United States of America particularly the urban education that we speak off, is an educational experience that is carried out in the midst or in the context of broken memories. And so consequently, what happened is that the teacher is often left with the responsibility of trying to repair that memory. But teacher may not even know what was lost. So, I'll tell you what was lost, I wanna show you how it was lost, then I wanna demonstrate, if possible, some way for us to achieve some degree of appreciation for, ah, ah, for dealing with the lo, the loss of memory. I mean, how do you deal with it? And I, I've raised these questions and I do it this way because, ah, many times I am asked by people, ah, in my City of Philadelphia, ah, what do we do with these young people, ah, in the inner city particularly African-American, ah, ah, males, ah, how, how do we respond? Wha, what do we do? What, how, wha, what's the issue? I wanna talk with you about that. That's what I wanna deal with. Let me, ah, back up and say that more than a hundred different African ethnic groups were brought to America from different places along the West Coast of Africa. When African people were brought to the Americas, and we were brought not just to the United States, but we were brought to Mexico, to Brazil, Guatemela, Nicaragua, Surinam, Gaiano, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Jamaica, Haiti, Martinique, Guadalupe, Bahamas, Puerto Rico. When African people were brought from the continent of Africa, what came with us were some parts of our memory that were distorted in the process of the enslavement. That slavery itself further distorted the memory of African people. And this distortion gave rise to a phenomenon that I have called the notion of Westernism, a westernity, because our problem is not so much modernity or post-modernity, the problem of African people is westernity. So, how do you deal with this notion of aggressive individualism, chauvinistic rationalism, and the sort of ruthless culturalism. These notions that have trapped our thinking about Africa in a place that moved us as African people over our own philosophical and psychological terms. Ah, let me put it this way, when you take someone from a continent and you move them to another continent, you move them all for physical terms. I mean, trees are not necessarily the same trees. The environment is different. Many things are different. I mean, you, you don't have the, the graves of your ancestors, you, you, you're just in a totally different places. That is one level of disruption and it's a profound level of disruption. To move someone just off of physical place particularly if you move them off of the physical place and you also, once you move them off of the physical place, you also deny them those memories even broken memories that they have brought with them 'coz they are broken. Actually, the middle passage was a part of that breaking this, you see. But, so you got this psychological displacement, this social displacement, this cultural displacement, philosophical displacement, even religious displacement, as well as the physical displacement. "What's your name?" Was the fundamental question in African societies. Name is important. Names mean something. You don't just give someone a name. That's why it was important in, in Yoruba society, another society (inaudible ) society, you wait days after a child was born before you give a child a name. How do you know the name of a child when it's just born? You gotta wait. You got to see. You, you, you don't know what the name should be. You just can't name someone John. Say, okay, you John, you get off the boat, your name is Omawally(ph), so, no, you're not gonna be Omawally(ph), you're gonna be John. Your name is Tobalayefah(ph). You're not gonna be Tobalayefah(ph), you're gonna be Mary. This is the beginning of the brokenness, you see, the, the, the loss of memory. With the lack of a name, you don't even know your lineage. If I kept my name, I would know precisely who my ancestors were. I'll be able to give you my genealogy. And by giving you my genealogy, I would be able to place myself, locate myself, center myself. You see, this is a centering, it's, it's a process of, of, ah, location. It's a perspectivist(ph) view, but it's a view that says that without this, what we're dealing with are pieces and one of the great epics of the African-American population. Perhaps, the nobility of our people comes often in the styles of those who have tried to put those pieces back together, those reconstructionist who so often are criticized by the proponents of westernity for their work to bring it back together. Those ama, amazing thing. It's almost like we're at a banquet and we're sitting at the table, and you all have food and I don't have any. But if I ask to have some, you say I'm a militant. You know what I'm saying. It's like, wait a minute, what, what, what constitutes the legitimacy of one group to promote this sort of aggressive culturalism against other groups. That's a problem. Now, let me problematize and texturize this a little bit more. In the ancient African world and I'll come back to this. There was a period that was referred to as SepTepy, the first occasion. And in the first occasion, the African people believed that God, whether you call God by the name of Ptah or Amen or Ra or Aton, created moisture and created air. Tefnut and Suez, and then Suez and Tefnut created earth, Geb and sky, Nut. And then after that, they created Ausar, Auset, Nebhet, and Seth. The Greeks later name these Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Seth. And there was a struggle between Seth and Ausar. He kills, Seth kills Ausar. His body has broken to 14 pieces, thrown around the world. And then, Isis or Auset along with her sister Nebhet and her son, Heru, they searched for the pieces of Ausar, and they discovered these pieces and they put them together, they stand him up alongside the banks of the Nile River. They give them, ah, Wooden Felis(ph) and they say, "This is now is the God of the Resurrection". In ancient Kamet, they call this the SepTepy, the first occasion. Everything in human history can be related to the SepTepy, because the SepTepy became not a part of the historical moment, but, and, and really not even a part of what we would normally call the prehistoric moment because it was before anytime. It was time before time. It's the unconscious. It is that which exist. And so, people operate it. On the basis of it, they referred to it. They spoke out of it. They gave their own impressions of what they saw and their activities on the basis of the SepTepy. But it wasn't written down. There's no book about it. There're references to it. There's no book about the SepTepy. But every action that occurred when Heru struggled against his uncle Seth, until the defeat of Seth where evil was defeated by good. Good defeats evil at Edfu. They build a temple there, a shrine, and they say, "This is the place". So, people live in time, in normal human time and they recognized that this is the place where it happened, but no one can say, "I remember when it happened." They can only know that somewhere in the past, in the far distant, distant past, before human beings came into time, there was the struggle where good overcame evil. Now, there's another story I wanna add to this. It is when Olorun, Olodumare in the Yoruba tradition asked Obatala to go to the earth and in a place called Ile-Ife to create human beings. And human beings that created and this place has given the name the place of heaven, meaning of Ile-Ife among the Yoruba in Nigeria. And then, out of that experience, there, there are guiding spirits that human beings have now developed the ability to discern based on population, based on how human beings act, based on many aspects of human nature. So, ah, after many generations, thousands of years, you can look at a population like this, like the population in this room and make some characterizations. So, yeah, we got 300, 200 people in this room, but there are only 20 types of people in this room. That's what the Yoruba could do. So, you can say, oh, yeah, if, if that person is thunderous, if that person is like lightning the Shango and then, maybe 20 people in here were Shangos. They can say that. It's the Ori, it's the head, it guides you, you see. But, there's not, they're not, everybody is not Shango. There are some people that they can look at and they say, "Wait a minute". But these people are the keepers of secrets. They have great strength and beauty of character. These are, these are Oshun. They could see that, you see. So, they're different people who have this or that's why it's also important you gotta, when you name a child, you gotta see what the character is. I'll come to that in a minute. But, the interesting thing about this is that these different Orisha as they called them were representatives of human beings, of the human community. So, if someone was indecisive or someone was one who, ah, couldn't tell whether to go forward or to go backwards. This, ah, you know, that's the, that's the Eshu spirit, that's a Legba. There it is. If someone was uhm, loud and tempestuous like the wind, ah, someone says that's Oya, you see. This is, this is how, this is how, ah, how, how people were able to do this. If you have certain gifts of comforting people and healing people, they say, "Oh, yeah, that's Babalu Aye. They could, they could do that based on memory, not necessarily being at the beginning when Olodumare gave the word to Obatala, the Creative, the one responsible for procreation, fertility, not necessarily being there, but knowing that everyone has an Ori. Everybody has, has a head. You see, what's your head? What's your guiding head, yeah. And the Babalawo(ph) would know this by knowing the community. Could be able to discern these things. Now what? In the first example, is a highest value that out of this unconscious place. It's Maat. Maat the concept, Maat. M-a-a-t, Maat. It is the first concept in the history of the world that deals with the whole question of how you keep the society stable and how you educate people properly, Maat. You educate people with truth, righteousness and justice, order, harmony, balance and the rest of the process. It's the meaning of Maat. It's a powerful concept. It's(ph) set at the very beginning with the Creator, according to the ancient people of the Nahu(ph) Valley, that Maat was the only, there was nothing in the beginning, but Maat. This is ah, mythological understanding, but I'm saying to you, it is a deep unconscious and with the Orishas(ph), he also deeply embedded in the African unconscious. I put to you this, part of the problem that we see sometimes in education is that we have no way of reaching the unconscious that has basically been so deeply broken and buried by the American experience that we see young people who seem to us to be inside the classroom but outside of the experience. Now, how do you deal with that brokenness? Let me tell you something. In 1865, at the close of the Civil War, there were, in this country, four and a half million African people who had lived through a horrendous experience of 246 years of enslavement. From can't see in the morning to can't see at night they had work. But they had not just worked. We were chatteled. Now, to explain chatteled should be pretty easy for us. It is, it comes from the same root as the word cattle. Same root as the word capital. Chattel, property. Your property, your, your, your car, your, your book ah, your uhm, your, your, your, your dog, your, your broom, I mean, your vacuum cleaner, whatever, it is yours. Chattel. What happens to chattel? Chattel cannot think. Chattel has no time. Chattel is not capable of even ordering its own sense of identity. It's a chattel. And I say this to you because I, I, to, to come to a resolution on this is because it's important for you to understand that the enslavement of Africans was not some wonderful idea of servitude. It's just people working for people. No. Africans, we, we were not humans. We were property. Did you know that until the, to the middle of the 17th century, people who held Africans in bondage didn't have to put clothes on us. We worked naked. A law was passed finally in Barbados. They said, "Wait a minute. You, you at least have to put clothes on your, your chattel". But the, but the slaveholders would say, "But we don't put clothes on our horses. They're chattel". It was the most degrading form of human bondage. And I say that because there, there is, in the popular literature some notion of the enslavement of Africans as somehow, well, an unfortunate experience of servitude. Last fall, I, I was asked to give the inaugural lecturer, lecture for the opening of the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool. I gave a lecture on this question of chattel because most people don't understand what chattel is. Well this is, this was the condition for 246 years of African people. We were chatteled. Now, in 1849, when White people were going to California, the 49ers, to get gold, we were still in bondage. 1849, we were still in bondage. We didn't get out of bondage until(ph) 1865. The whole country had essentially been taken over by 1865. People had ah, ranches that had 50,000 acres. Other people had gone and found their wealth in various parts of the continent. Black people were in bondage to 1865. When we got out of bondage, there were some things that added to this brokenness of memory. In the first instance, we got out of bondage, and we didn't have anything. Nothing. No clothes, no shoes, nothing. There was nothing that Africans had. You, yup, we worked for 246 years, but had nothing. And even when we asked and it was promoted in the Congress by a couple of progressive legislators that African people be given 40 acres of land and a mule, that was rejected by the U.S. Congress. Because some people saying, "Look, it's just not proper". "You've worked this people for so many years, let's at least give them a foothold in the American economy. Let's give them 40 acres of land and a mule" This is why Spike Lee called his joint 40 acres, you see. Just give us our 40 ac, give us 40 acres, something to start with. Broken, the broken memories. Now here, here's the point, that I wanna make, then I'll come back to education(ph) in a minute. The point I wanna make is that there was no group therapy. There's no collective therapy. No, no one said, "Look, you need to process what has happened. You people have been in bondage for so many years. And, you know, let's, let's go through at least two or three years of processing. Let's go back and try to instill memory". Because once you instill memory, then you can get people to remember. At, at some level this, this is the process, you see. This is a process of, of how do you deal with this problem of brokenness in terms of broken memory. That's where Afrocentricity comes in. Now.

MOLEFI KETE ASANTE  I, I looked at, when I was writing the first books on Afrocentricity, and now there are four. The first book was really, I call it a lover's book. It was really not a book, academic book, or intellectual book. It was really ah, almost ah, a guide for the African-American community. It was called "Afrocentricity". The second book was a theoretical book called, "The Afrocentric Idea." The third book was called "Kemet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge," and it was written ah, for the graduate students, the first graduate students in the Ph.D. program at Temple. And then the last book which just came out this year, ah, a month ago was ah, is called, "An Afrocentric Manifesto" and it's published by Polity Press in Oxford. Now, what, what was the reason for this process. It's this way, if you talk about the unconscious, particularly in terms of African-Americans, you have to try to get to this, ah, the basic problem of the loss of African-ness because, this is ah, is at the root of everything. That's why I tell people, it's not a self-esteem problem that African-American children have. African-American children are, ah, have a great personal self-esteem. Most of them I, I, I've dealt with and ah, most of the research will tell you that that's not a problem. Self-esteem is not a problem with African-American children. They like who they are. They like how they do whatever they do. They like that. And they'll tell you, "I like who I am. I'm fine. It's not a problem." Problem with African-American children is cultural esteem. They don't like Africa. We don't like Africa because Westernity has broken our memory and has poisoned our minds. That's our problem. Now, because that's a problem, because it's a problem of collective cultural esteem and not a matter of personal esteem, self-esteem, you have people who would say, "I'm fine. I'm an individual. I'm okay". But at the same time, the masses of people carry around this huge burden of the enslavement of Africa, of Africans. And this huge burden that the images that they see even now of Africa are negative. I start a class, I teach a class called Africa in the 20th Century, you know how I started their class? I start it two ways. I turn the map upside-down, rather the globe upside-down first. Then after I turn the globe upside-down, then I show, I start the first lecture is, "Let's look at modern Africa where we see cities in Africa. We'll see any animals. We'll see any rural areas of Africa. We see cities in Africa". We go back after that and then deal with the other realities of about Africa. That's important because the images in the minds of most people in the United States of America about Africa are totally bad. So, in and, so does it affect the African-Americans? Yes. We have the same images. We have the same teachers. Th, the people who teach you ah, teach me is the same. So, so, what do we do? We have to break that. Challenge it. And once we challenge it, then we put in place something that is different so that people begin to be recentered. It's the recentering process that is, that is essential, you see. So, you then have to make children owners of knowledge not, not renters of European knowledge. Owners of knowledge. Let, let me tell you the difference. You see, when I am in a classroom, whatever that classroom is, whatever the subject is in that classroom, one of the things that I have to do, I have to remember as I am ah, teaching, is that, if I'm teaching literature, if I'm teaching science, if I'm ah, teaching uhm, uhm, art, I have to know that all humans, everywhere on the earth have contributed to human understanding and human knowledge. So, I have to make my students, all of my students have a sense of ownership of that information. I can't teach as if the ownership of art belongs only to the Greeks, when in fact the Greeks were latecomers to art. I, I can't do that. I mean, what about the Chinese, the Indians, the Africans. You, you can't, you cannot do it that way. You, you have to talk about it. Now, this is a good point to talk of little bit about standards and criteria. You have to talk about co-existing frameworks not a monopolistic framework, not a hegemonic framework, co-existing frameworks of human knowledge that are happening all over the earth. And even though we say that the six billion people on the face of the earth can be traced back to one African woman who lived 200,000 or 300,000 years ago in East Africa, we have been, the, the migration, the migration out of Africa has brought, has put people all over the globe. Look, 50,000 years ago, everybody in the world was Black according to the scientists. And most of the life that we've spent in terms of our DNA, was spent in the continent of Africa. We, some, you know, 20,000 years ago the people who went to Europe, left Africa. But the people who went to Asia left Africa also. People who went to South Amer, ah, well, South America left Africa. Ah, people who came to North America left Africa. The people who went to the other parts of the African continent left East Africa. That's, that's the history of human DNA. But, with that history in a short period of time, the last 500 years, the period of Cologne, Columbus, Col, the, the whole Columbian era, is the era where we have these different problems that have come into human, humanity that we have to deal with. And when we start talking about Afrocentric understanding, what we're saying is that the, that all study of African phenomena must allow for African agency. You must allow African people to be subject in, in our own history, not acted upon, not victims, ah, ah, to Europe, not objects in Europe, not on the fringes of the European experience, but subject, actors(ph) in, in the historical records. But, but it should be true for everybody. The European interpretation of the world is only a particularist interpretation of the world. And this cryptic particularity is what is at the root, it seems to me, of this whole process of Westernity. I even think it's so with globalization. What is globalization? This, again, is a promotion of a hegemonic idea of Europeanization of the world. Last year, I was in ah, Hang Zhou in China at Zhejiang University. And, this was one of the big topics, "The Rhetoric of Globalization". What is the meaning of this? What, what is the intent of this discussion? It's not a, it's not a, a discourse that ah, that is being promoted. It's a monologue. And it's a monologue that sits in front of the door to humanity, having a sense of pluralism without hierarchy. That's, that's what we, we confronted with. But the Afrocentric idea ah, is an idea that says that, "When African people are studied, when you're teaching African people, you must allow agency. You cannot impose Europe-owned African people". And everything up until the beginning of 1970s, that I had seen that Europe had done with education for African people as when Europe interpreting Africa's history, and Europe interpreting African-American's history. That's what I had seen. That's why I wrote the book. Wait a minute. How are you gonna study the history of Southern Africa and you really are studying David Livingstone. That, that only, only important thing happening in Africa is David Livingstone being lost in the forest. Come on. He's, he's in the midst of hundreds of thousands of people who are carrying out ordinary history everyday. Who are these people? What are their names? In Philadelphia where I live, they had ah, they have the Independence Hall. You know, the question that I always ask, what were the Black people, who were cooking for the people who are meeting for the Declaration of Independence, what were the Black people, who were waiting with the horses, what were they talking about? What do they know about Jefferson? What was the gossip outside the hall? About those White guys inside the hall talking about the independence from Britain. It's an interesting question. Let's turn it on its head and let's and, and, and maybe we don't have the documents, but we can speculate. "Oh, yeah. I know Mr. Jefferson". You know, right. (chuckles) You know, we had a big campaign in Philadelphia because of George Washington. You know what George Washington did? When George Washington came, he was president in Philadelphia 'coz Philadelphia was the first capital, you see. So, George Washington held his presidency in Philadelphia, but he was from Virginia. So, he brought with him seven enslaved Africans, which was a, it, it was against the law in Pennsylvania at that time for, for slaves to be in Pennsylvania for six months, ah, uhm, ah, be, ah, because if they were there for six months, they would have to be free. But instead of freeing them, what Washington would do, would send them back to Virginia for two weeks and then he would bring them back to Pennsylvania, so they were not there unbroken for six months and so forth. And they he kept them in the horse stables out, in the back of the house. He's the first president of United States of America. Now I'm, oh, what I'm saying about this is that, part of our issue with the, ah, unconscious, is that we need to, we need to have this Africaness. Now, with the conscious level, we, we have already what I call Africanity. That is you have African people choosing African names, you have African, ah, ah, ah, ah, symbols and designs in classrooms. You have people wearing African dress. You, you have people traveling to Africa. There is a level of Africanity that exists at the conscious level, but then there is that final level, which is self-conscious. And that is to act, to act in a self-conscious way to preserve, to allow for, and if you are an African person, to exercise your own agency on the basis of your own historical understanding. If we can do these things, I guarantee you that the criteria, ah, or the standards for, for teaching what, ah, I mean, we can put those standards together and we will be extremely successful because what we have done, we will have mastered the memory ourselves and that's what you can do, everybody can do that. I always tell people, "If you're ah, because, ah, I tell my students, I have White students, and Asian students come to study Afrocentricity, can you imagine that, the first Chinese to get a Ph.D. in African-American studies came to Temple to study with me because he wanted to have an Afrocentric understanding, not a Eurocentric understanding of African-Americans. And he went back to China to do, to be director of Multi-cultural studies, but the interesting thing with, with Young Ji(ph), when he came was he was interested in trying to get some idea about how you interpret the record of African people from the standpoint of African people, that, that is, that's the key. And that's what you can do, you master the memory. You learn to master the memory. You can teach it there. You, you can teach people. You get, you get, you have credibility in the classroom. The one thing that all teachers have to have, I think to be effective, is credibility. You gain credibility through knowledge, through mastering the memories of different people. When I had Vietnamese students in my classroom at Temple, I went and I learned about the Trung Sisters, and when I spoke about political issues in the world, even though I could speak about Joan of Arc or speak about Inzinga in Angola, when I spoke about the Trung Sisters, my Vietnamese students came up to me afterwards and said, they appreciate I, "We appreciate so much, how do you know about the Trung Sisters?" I say, I'm a good teacher. I, I do audience analysis. That, that's what you do you, you, as a teacher you have to do that, how do you touch that student, how do you, how do you, you have that one student from Albania in there, how do you touch that student? You got to know some example, some illustration, something that ties, that attaches the student to the subject. That's what good teaching is. And at a Winter Roundtable, I know exactly that this is, ah, what you're doing and I'm extremely proud, ah, to be a part of this conference, uhm, is it? Oh, thank you very much. Good. Good. All right. Because what you are doing sits at the very beginning of all consciousness because at the level of Afrocentricity then, here's what you wanna do. You wanna first of, you all do what I call linguistic cleansing. You don't use words, you don't want to use words like "pygmy(ph)". You don't want to use words like "bushmen". You don't, you want, you do not want to call people "hottentots". You don't wanna use "tribe". You don't wanna use "primitive" in a pejorative sense, you see. The, the things, these are just, you don't wanna talk about "universal men". All of these terms that have gender problems and cultural problem, you, you, you want, they, they will say that you are, well, they just call it, pol, ah, "policing", some kind of "policing", you see. But it's not that, it's your searching for humanity at a deeper level of understanding. If the people don't call themselves "bushmen", why do you call them "bushmen"? You know, I've been at Africa 65 times. I lived in Zimbabwe, I have never yet met a person, who came up to me and say, "Hello, I'm a bushman". Is, isn't that, isn't it, people don't tell it like that, 'coz(ph) they don't know such thing, as an pejorative term. It was meant as a pejorative term, when it was given to him. They call themselves, "coy". They are people, people and not "pygmy(ph)". They come, there are ethnic names and all the small people are not at the same eth, ethnicity. There are some who Ituri, there are some who Imbuti, there are some who are Thwa(ph), there are different ethnic names of these people, so you just say "pygmy(ph)", I don't know what you're talking about. I don't who you're talking about. Is, is and, and these negative names, and these again, these again sits at the heart of the problem of memory with African-American because the African-American don't want to be identified with that. That's negative and certainly what, everyone recognizes even in your at, at the conscious level, people recognize that the word "tribe" is not a good word. But you know, people would defend that, "Oh, I don't see anything wrong with a tribe." I say, well, you know, when I'm in the museum, natural, even there was a Natural, ah, History museum in Buffalo, they have examples of people from all over the earth. They have Chinese, Frenchmen, Zulu tribesmen. I said, "Wait a minute. Why, why isn't that just Zulu? Well, what's this tribesmen business, you know what I mean." It's reserve for native Americans, Africans and maybe some people in South Pacific, that, that's where it, that, it's a pejo, it's a pejorative, a negative term. So, one(ph) says, "Well, you know, all it means is that the people come from a small group of people." I said, "With a house of people in, ah, Nigeria, there are 80 million of them. So, why do you call them the "house of tribe", you know, what, what, what are you talking about?" They said, "Well, it means," well, it probably means that the, there, there, these are just, these are the, the early, ah, early people. There are all kinds of explanations rather than to do the right thing. You know, people just don't want to do the right thing, do the right thing. Find out what the people call themselves and, and, and you have to be careful now about finding out what they call themselves, that's the other problem because, again, broken memory, with broken memory they don't even remember. Like, I had, I did have this to happen where, ah, ah, a teacher told me, a colleague of mine said, "Well, you know, I got, ah, Kofi in my classroom and he says that his from the Fante Tribe and his from Africa. So, are you telling me that he is not from the, he's not, I shouldn't call him from the Fante Tribe but he says he says from the Fante Tribe." I said, "Well, Kofi is a guy who has a broken memory." Number one there is no word for tribe in his language. Number two, he has just picked up an English usage, you see and that's what happen on the colo, co, co, colonization. You colonize somebody and you give them the words that you want them to use. You give them the language. You, just like you give a person a name and you say you're gonna be called John or you're gonna be called Mary, even though you have an African name. It is this process of Westernity. It is taking people and with a sort of ruthless culturalism, forcing them, almost to accept your particularism as if it is universal. There's nothing wrong with a Eurocentric point of view, except when it imposes itself as universal on other people, you see. I, it must be viewed alongside other cultures, not hegemonically above other cultures. And when we're able to this in our classrooms, where we able to do it as teachers, we create a whole new world. We, we generate new energy. We have students who are willing to learn and who are eager to learn because that's at the very base of what they ought to do or what they wanna do. They act on the basis of memory there, you see. That's at the highest level, the unconscious level, Africaness, the conscious level, Africanity and then, at the final level of self-conscious action, you have a, you have A, Afrocentric understanding and appreciation, where people are able to create out of that experience. In fact, and not only to create out of it, but to share, you have something to share. We have no diversity, if I become you. If I become you, like so many people seem to want to force Africans to be, if I become you and I give up my heritage, I change my name, I change my culture, I change my dress, I change my religion and I become you, there is no diversity around the table. There's just an imitation of white. I refuse to do that because it is not correct for humanity. It is not correct for what we share on the earth. And you should be happy that I refused to do it because you want the diversity that I bring to the table, you see. That, that's the joy and I think that's the difference in terms of, when you start talking about America. I mean, what America is, is a country that finds its vigor, its strength, its energy in diversity. It is not a mono-cultural society even though there has been a mono-cultural hegemony and that mono-cultural hegemony has basically attempted to obliterate all evidences of the diversity. In the end, as teachers, psychologists, educators with great specialties. You've come to this Winter table, a Rou, Winter Roundtable, and you will leave here and may you leave here always knowing that you must as a teacher, to paraphrase for now(ph). You must find your own mission in this, and you have two possibilities. You actually have three; you can ignore it, you can betray it or you can fulfill your mission, and I ask you to work to fulfill your mission. Thank you.
