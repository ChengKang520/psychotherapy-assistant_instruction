ERIC GREEN Hello, and welcome to the new film, Counseling Families with Young Children: Play-Based Interventions. I am Dr. Eric Green, a registered play therapist supervisor, a credential conferred by the Association for Play Therapy. I'm also a licensed professional counselor supervisor as well as a Union Sand Play practitioner, a credential conferred by the Sand Play Therapist of America. I work fulltime as an associate professor of school counseling at Purdue University in West Lafayette at Indiana where I teach graduate courses and supervise students in clinical practice and play therapy in school counseling. I also maintain a part time summer teaching schedule at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland where I coordinate the annual Johns Hopkins Play Therapy Institute. I regularly present my research at the annual conferences for the Association for play therapy and the American Counseling Association as well as speak nationally and internationally on the topic of expressive arts and play therapy with children and families. The professional role I am most drawn to is my clinical work with children and families. In my part time private practice, I counsel children and families and supervise practicum students who use play therapy and expressive arts with children and families as their primary treatment modality. My disaster mental health work with traumatized children which integrates the use of play and expressive arts has been featured on CNN. I am the co-editor of Integrating Expressive Arts and Play Therapy with children and adolescents as well as the author of the handbook of Jungian Play Therapy. I also have a new book coming out this fall of 2015, titled Counseling Families Play Based Treatment. This video provides an overview of incorporating play and expressive art interventions to increase facilitative communication and bolster pro-social dynamics between young children, their family members and their family counselor within the middle health paradigm of care. The basic assumption underlying the use of play with families is that children may find that the less verbal means of communication from expressive modalities, are developed mentally sensitive and possibly beneficial. In other words, the use of play therapy integration such as mandalas and family genograms and sand play may facilitate a curative path for the child that in genders honest and open communication that engages the child at their own time and pacing. This video will briefly describe and demonstrate interventions such as parent consultation, assessment through genograms, family mandalas and parental follow up sessions. The term family has become more inclusive over the years, no longer referring simply to a biological mother, father and child. Today, the term often invokes images of children accompanied by one, two or many adults of different genders, ages and ethnicities. Parenthood is inherently stressful. However, children also represent an expansion of the self, of purpose, of fun, security and motivation. And these ways children are centrally located within the family structure. And it would stand to reason that any family counseling would include them. Alternately, we know that including parents in work with children is tremendously helpful in achieving positive mental health outcomes. So it would make sense that parents are involved in child focused therapies as well. Historically, however, theorist and clinicians have been divided about including both parents and children in therapy. With many believing that parents and children should be treated separately or that one party should be omitted completely. For example, Virginia Axline believed it was unnecessary for parents to be present in play therapy. And Melanie Klein viewed parents as intrusive in the process. Carl Jung saw no reason to include children in therapy as he considered children's problems to be reflections of unresolved parental conflicts. Others made strong cases for the inclusion of both parents and children in counseling. In the field of family counseling, Carl Whitaker and David Keith noticed that change occurred more slowly when children were excluded from the process. And other prominent theorist and clinicians made similar strong cases for including children and family counseling. In play therapy, theorist identify the importance of parents' involvement in child treatment, resulting in the development of treatment such as filial therapy by the Gurneys, Theraplay by John Berg and Family Play Therapy by Eliana Gil. These approaches enhanced family interactions and provided opportunities to directly address family dynamics. Today, many clinicians in the play therapy and family counseling fields continue to separate parents and children during therapeutic work. One study by Johnson & Thomas from 1999, found that many family counselors excluded children completely from family sessions, while others included children, but did not engage with them during sessions. Why the disparity? Many family counselors feel at a loss when it comes to actively including children in treatment, particularly because children's engagement tends to involve less verbal expression and some family therapy training programs fall short in adequately teaching child focused interventions. They may struggle to incorporate play into their theoretical orientation, worry about the cost of acquiring toys and expressive art materials or fear appearing foolish or incompetent to the adult clients in the room. For many play therapists, family issues are a common area of focus in their practices. And some authors have suggested that play therapist may be more open to the idea of integrating family counseling and play therapy than family counselors or themselves. Yet many play therapists feel inadequate in their ability to treat older adult members of the family. And their openness to integrating play therapy with family counseling seems to decrease as children enter adolescence. Furthermore, some play therapist may struggle to inject systemic thinking into their conceptualization of cases and may miss opportunities to enhance treatment or utilize play as a means of family assessment. Finally, play therapist and counselors who expand their practice to include treating families invariably touch upon the issue of their own families of origin. Whenever counselors engage professionally within family systems, their own disaffected or disconnected familial themes may become activated. For instance, relational dynamics, responsive communication, family traditions and intergenerational elements passed down may activate the counter transference within the clinicians own family of origin subtext. As well as archetype of roles such as the caring mother and just in father, these dynamic psychological issues are an inevitable part of Emily… every family's life. However, if counselors have not analyzed their own familial themes and if they have not addressed their influence on the shaping of their behaviors in their adult lives, they are at risk for being psychologically triggered when they enter the dynamics of their own client's familial systems. This may result in undermining their ethical ability to maintain the professional role of neutrality and they contaminate the transference. Training in family systems theory with an emphasis on exploring one's own family of origin is an essential mechanism to prepare mental health clinicians to work effectively within families and childrens. Family based interventions have begun gaining popularity in the child treatment field. This video was born out of this increasing enthusiasm for family involvement as well as a recognition that many play and family counselors still struggle to incorporate each other's philosophies into their work. My hope is that this video will assist you, the counselor, mental health practitioner in viewing referrals through a wider lens, a systemic one, considering how and where families can be integrated into children's therapy. Through this video, I will also aim to add meaningfully to the current literature on play in family counseling, keeping in mind the humanistic aim upon which modes, most of play and family counseling is built upon. The power of the humanistic approach was elucidated by a family therapy pioneer, Virginia Satir who once said, "Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open and rules are flexible, the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family." Unfortunately, this powerful aspect of treatment is often overshadowed by current emphasis on standardized evidence based treatment protocols. Research on mental health disorders in children suggest that insight therapy such as family play counseling are effective because they foster positive psychological capacities for youth and their caretakers. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis by Jonathan Schuttler(ph), he identified multiple factors specific to the inside based approach that can easily be integrated with an evidence-based protocols including a focus on affect and expression of emotion. Identification of themes and returning patterns. A focus on the relationship. And an exploration of fantasy life. Thus, this video strives to provide the most current research supported trends in family counseling intervention, so that you, the practitioner may incorporate them into your current practice. While this is not an exhaustive video, I hope that, you, the reader will glean practical pieces of information to assist in furthering knowledge and awareness of the importance of incorporating play with families, especially those with young children. I encourage you, the viewer, to seek out additional materials on this topic, such as, the family puppet interview developed by Eleanor Irwin and Malloy from 1994, as well as the seminal books on family play that inspired this volume, including Eliana Gil's second edition from 2014. And also Schaefer and Carey's book from 1994. Also, I want to encourage you to seek out the newest work by Dr. Louise Gurney and Ryan on filial therapy with parents in group settings. When considering the implementation of play therapy in family counseling, a clinician should be familiarized with the typical setting, situations, materials and research that are generally needed to competently execute these interventions. Speaking of settings, the typical settings clinicians may utilize include private practice work, outpatient and inpatient treatment settings, community counseling agencies, secondary schools and disaster mental health work. The clinical situations also vary in scope and depth and not all families will be amenable to or develop a predilection for the expressive arts. It is up to the clinician to collaboratively and non-judgmentally work with the family to determine what is the most effective means of communication and relationship building within the fair therapeutic dyad. The materials needed to implement family counseling with play depend upon the modality. For this video, play therapy, and mandalas, and drawing and the use of sand miniatures are indicated. Also will cover bibliotherapy. But play therapy also include supplies such as board games, maybe a laptop to play music, to look at Facebook with internet access, card games, place based activities such as Frisbee, badminton, Jenga. Art media which includes construction paper, multi-colored pencils, paint brushes, paint, glue, white paper, glitter and stickers. Next, we will cover specific information to execute the interventions demonstrated in the upcoming clinical sessions. Drawings and Mandalas. Drawings are any type of creativity that is produce uniquely by a child family and is a valid form of self-expression and inner communication. Art or drawings include various types of media including abstract paintings, collages, mandalas, drawings on paper and various other types of self-expression that fit under the rubric of creativity. Art is individualistic, and therefore, is not judged by the therapist as right or wrong. All art that families produce is viewed as valued and of meaning as it comes from within and is externalized outward. The research to support Art and Drawings in family counseling demonstrates that creative self expression in the company of a non-judgmental caring therapist promotes healing in families as well as increases a sense of self-worth and improve self acceptance. In this video, I will be demonstrating how the coloring of mandalas, circular shapes with intricate designs promotes relaxation and potentially assist the child's psyche in coordinating and self-regulating affect of impulses as well as the families as a whole. To execute the coloring mandala intervention, the therapist must first engage in a couple of minutes of deep breathing and relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation. Next the therapist must have several pre-design mandalas available for the family to choose from. These may be procured at no cost by exploring the Internet or by purchasing a workbook specifically containing mandala prints. After the child and our family members choose the mandala that they wish to color, the therapist then ask them to color them the mandala while the therapist sits in relative silence and observes. They may color one together or each separately. It is preferred that they color each one separately and work on their own individually. The therapist me ask if it is okay that soft music be played in the background during the activity. If so, the therapist can use a laptop and navigate to YouTube to find relaxation tunes or you may visit my website at www.DrEricGreen.com where there is a repository of free relaxation tunes from which you may choose. The therapist does not verbalize or initiate conversation while the family is coloring the mandala, but remains a silent supportive observer. After the family completes the mandala, the therapist asks to write the story of the mandala on the back of the paper. The story of the mandala is whatever the family or each individual family member sees when looking at the drawing. Also, they may identify colors in their mandala and maybe create a color map depicting what each color means. We emphasize that there is no right or wrong answer. Also, the therapist does not interpret or analyze the mandala or drawing, but after completion, simply ask, is there anything you'd like to share about your mandala? Then the therapist encourages active listening skills by family member share. And then ask if anyone has any questions or comments about each other's mandala. Some other questions may include, if you can give this mandala a title, what might it be? Afterwards, the therapist places the Mandala in the folder and keeps the image contained to maintain the free and protected space facilitated within the consulting room. The next intervention play therapy and family genograms. While play therapy is traditionally used with young children, play based activities often work well within familial context, especially if they are developmentally sensitive and are chosen freely or collaboratively. Play therapy is the use of toys and activities as a symbolic expression of an individual's experience through play where toys or activities represent interior dialogue and play represents a meta-communicative language. The child is able to engage in an expressive form of interaction with the family therapist or play therapist, to either communicate, self express or externalize difficult feelings or cognitions in less threatening mechanisms. In this video, I will be demonstrating an activity called family genogram. The genogram is an assessment technique that maintains a symbolic way. A child and family made to pick their inner dynamics and outward relational patterns and externalize these through play based media. The purpose of this activity is to facilitate communication and assess family dynamics and patterns subjectively through the individual family members perspectives. In this intervention, therapists first want to take a couple of minutes to engage in relaxation or deep breathing to decrease the autonomic nervous system and to increase the capacity for the psyche to express itself more freely. Next, the therapist provides various sanctuary miniatures and a white sheet of paper. The therapist initiates a conversation about different family members and ask the family to draw circles for females, and squares for males, and to depict a brief family tree. Next, the family has provided the opportunity to search for images that they believe represent the identity of those figures using the sand figurines. After, the therapist then asked the family, "Is there anything you'd like to share about your genogram?" And instead of focusing specifically on directive questions, the therapist may want to instead listen and make in path of reflective statements to encourage and support the family and their creative endeavor. The therapist will take a note of any discrepancies that arise from various perceptions by family members of each other. Also any clinical data about relational fractures will be documented as they may reappear in the family play therapy later on to be worked through. Parent consultation and modeling facilitative communication. This portion of family play therapy should ideally occur each week or every other week during family play. This is an opportunity for parents to express their concerns and relay positive developments from home during the course of the psychotherapy, it is also an opportunity for the therapist to introduce facilitative communication skills from the filial or child-centered therapy paradigm. Such as, returning responsibility to the child, tracking, encouraging versus praise, and setting therapeutic limits. The modeling of skills is depended upon the information provided by the parent and observed by the child in the sessions. In this video, I provided a cursory overview of some of the essential play and expressive art therapies that may be practiced with young children and families and mental health care. Then, we viewed a few clinical sessions with a family who are engaged in various expressive art interventions which allowed for self expression, developmentally appropriate symbolic communication, and creative or imaginative freedom. The viewer is urge to seek outside supervision regarding use of applications from disciplines within play therapy and family counseling to competently practice this modality. Also, this video is by no means a substitute for what constitutes best practices when learning new areas within the mental health field. Formal education and training, supervised practice, and critical reflectivity/therapist-initiated inner work. The significance of engaging in an ongoing reflectivity in our archetypal role as the wounded healer, expands our collective awareness and calls us to be responsible, progressive and endlessly curious. The child like puer aeternus calls us to for go complacent behaviors and to seek new aspects of our field, new paradigms validated by research and new paths to take them and lead us to understanding of ourselves and our patients that can deepen our work with them. Thank you for viewing this video. I hope it deepens your work with young children and their family.

00:21:05
ERIC GREEN So, Najina, what brings you in today? 

00:21:05
NAJINA Umm… I wanted to come in and discuss with you, the changing dynamics in our household recently. Umm… my ex-husband and I are divorced. And he decided to move away to Houston, which is about four hours away and it's been really affecting my son. 

00:21:20
ERIC GREEN In what ways? 

00:21:25
NAJINA Just him, not seeing him as frequently. And, umm… as having to kind of change up the routines and schedules. And, umm… I've just noticed that he's been acting out a little more in school and being a little more aggressive with playmates and not listening as much with his teacher and even in the home environment. 

00:21:45
ERIC GREEN How long it's been since he's relocated? 

00:21:45
NAJINA Umm… he moved away at the end of December. So probably right around six months. 

00:21:50
ERIC GREEN Okay. And can you tell me a little bit more about the relationship between your son and his father and between you and his father. 

00:22:00
NAJINA They are extremely close, they were extremely close. Umm… first couple of years, umm… my son's name is (inaudible ), but we call him Diggy(ph). Umm… he would stay home with his dad. My ex-husband is a nurse, so he had a schedule where he worked, uh, three days a week fulltime. So those other two days Diggy(ph) would stay home with him and go to daycare. So he's extremely close to him. Umm… and they still have a pretty close relationship. He talks to him every day on FaceTime. So, uh, that dynamic hasn't changed, but his presence is definitely affecting him being gone. Umm… when he was here, when we initially got divorced, he would see him on, umm… Tuesday evenings, he would come and get him, he would stay the night and keep him overnight and keep him all day Wednesday and bring him home. And then he would have him every other weekend. Umm… we get along relatively well, we're co-parenting well together. No hostility, no anger or anything like that and we parent well for the sake of our son. So we don't have any animosity. He is getting remarried, umm… again. So that's another big change for Diggy(ph), is that there is another, umm… woman in the picture and that is about to be a new step mom and then she has a daughter as well. But, umm… they do have a really good relationship, him and the stepdaughter. So that's a good thing, so. 

00:23:20
ERIC GREEN Okay. So it sounds like your son is, is grappling with many changes, with the family dynamics, he was very close to the father, still he is very close, but because you're, uh, his father has moved on to Houston and is not geographically close to him anymore that he's, maybe, missing him at times and feeling something is not quite the way it used to be. 

00:23:45
NAJINA Yeah. 

00:23:45
ERIC GREEN And that's affecting and you said… It sounds like it's affecting him a little bit at school. You said he's, may be becoming a little bit aggressive. But it sounds like you have a good relationship with his son's, father and that's… It seems like that may be helping things a little bit as well. And it sounds like also he's… maybe, facing the change of a new stepmother in the picture and a new stepsister? 

00:24:10
NAJINA Absolutely. 

00:24:10
ERIC GREEN Yeah. And so that's probably a lot. And how old is he, again? He is… 

00:24:15
NAJINA He turned six this past March. 

00:24:20
ERIC GREEN All right, six. Umm… did you observe him at school or did you get feedback from teachers? 

00:24:25
NAJINA Umm… I got feedback from the school counselor. I have a very, umm… pretty close relationship with her. I talk to her often. And I did, umm… ask her, she did ask me if I wanted him to do, like just a little play, pull out a group thing with her occasionally with some other little kids, from divorced families. And so they pull-out and do little games together occasionally, umm… so that they can, you know, just, kind of, get that opportunity not to feel different so that they could see some other children that are going through the same thing. Umm… and umm… His teacher and I talk often and the assistant principal at the school, she and I talk often. You know, and he has a little outburst and stuff, he may have to go walk often and speak to her, every now and again, very easily redirected. Umm… but just some moments he has to be pulled out and, you know, grasp with the fact that he's upset or his feelings are hurt or umm… something that's going on. I did notice that he started asking more questions after his birthday. And it was the first time that, umm… Marley, which is the new little sister and… Well, big sister and the, umm… step mom came into our home for the first time. And so that's when a lot of the questions started, kind of, coming into play. Umm… is my dad her dad? And does she have a dad? And, you know, wanting to know a little bit more of them. And umm… we talked about it a little more and some of the behaviors escalate a little bit and then after we talked about it, things, kind of, dissipated a little bit. But, you know, that kind of on and off, so. 

00:26:00
ERIC GREEN Sure. Sounds like you both are grappling with… are, are facing a lot of adjustment. 

00:26:05
NAJINA Absolutely. 

00:26:05
ERIC GREEN And so it sounds like some of these behaviors are probably very developmentally appropriate to what's occurring which isn't necessarily bad, it's just a change which is bringing about some, may be some difficult feelings or some uncertainties like may be that's why he's asking you questions about, does she have a dad too or… 

00:26:25
NAJINA Right. 

00:26:25
ERIC GREEN Okay. Umm… what were you hoping to get out of family play therapy? Is there any goal that you had that you wanted to collaborate with me on or is there something that you'd like to just, kind of, for me to have in the back of my mind as we go through, umm… the next few sessions? 

00:26:45
NAJINA Umm… maybe just better ways that I can communicate to him, umm… the changes and then better ways I could communicate to dad, to communicate to him, umm… so that I may not becoming off as being, umm… controlling or, umm… may be hostile and so that we're all working together in both households to make things, umm… comfortable for maybe both the children, I don't know how she's doing, Marley's doing with things. And she's a little older, she is three years older than Diggy(ph), so umm… she's probably a little more developmentally umm… comfortable with things. But I don't know. Umm… and so I was hoping just to be able to find some ways to work with him and communicate better with him, the changes and to may be communicate better with dad. And so we can have some more cohesive households across the board because he is leaving soon to go stay there, umm… for a few weeks for summer. And I just want to make sure that we continue to co-parent together well and we're able to offer him the opportunity to transition well into the next school year which is first grade. And so, I want to have a more positive school year, next year. 

00:27:55
ERIC GREEN Sure. So it sounds like you want some support with communicating the changes and maybe when he ask questions. And it sounds like you want to continue a cohesive co-parenting and you don't want to come across his exhibiting too much external… 

00:28:10
NAJINA Absolutely. 

00:28:10
ERIC GREEN Okay, great. Umm… so let's talk a little bit if it's okay with you about what family play therapy is and, kind of, what… kind of what, uh…, it entails and then I want to, if you're open to it, maybe do a couple of brief role-plays about things that may come up with Diggy(ph), that you may want, how to communicate on and then I can maybe role-play with you. Umm… it's called, uh, it's like a humanistic or child-centered approach. Umm… so there are some skills just very briefly I'd like to go over. And then, first of all, I'll just talk to you briefly, play therapy, umm… is… umm… the child… It's, it's a mental health paradigm that we use to help children usually, umm… who were in elementary schools or middle school, it also works with adults and adolescents as well. But, umm… typically children see toys as their words and play as their language and so there are a little bit more comfortable communicating their concerns, their fears, their apprehensions, their, uh, issues surrounding adjustment through non-verbal means, umm… through creating, umm… art maybe, through playing outside. Umm… have you noticed if Diggy(ph) does any type of play activities, umm… that he enjoys? 

00:29:25
NAJINA Yeah, he has several that he enjoys, he likes… He's really into animals and stuff, so he's like obsessed with roly-poly's and water and the dog. I did get him a dog when things started, kind of, first changing as a way to, you know, umm… get his mind off of things. And he loves this dog, so. 

00:29:45
ERIC GREEN What his dog's name? 

00:29:45
NAJINA Colin. 

00:29:45
ERIC GREEN Colin. Okay. 

00:29:45
NAJINA Yeah. 

00:29:45
ERIC GREEN So, umm… in family play therapy what we do is, umm… I basically would be meeting with you like every other week to do a consult like we're doing today. Umm… and in between our consults, I would be meeting with your son and doing a brief like 20-minute individual play therapy session where he would play out. That's why I have these sand miniatures behind us, umm… to do sand play, to do, umm… we have different expressive art activities like these call mandalas, where children color, uh, and they write stories that help some, kind of, externalize what's going on inside and it helps them a, a safe way to, kind of, process some of their difficult feelings about whatever it is that might be bothering them or maybe not even bothering them, maybe to help them adjust to the next stage of development. Umm… in family play they… That pieces, so I would, uh, like, we're gonna do today, go over some role-plays with you. And then we would all get together and play together. We believe that the family that plays together, stays together. 

00:30:50
NAJINA That's great. 

00:30:50
ERIC GREEN So, umm… Right. And you had also talked about wanting to maintain your healthy relationship and your communicative relationship with your son about these changes. And so maybe through play, we can adjust or address some of those difficulties or challenges as a, as a family together. 

00:31:10
NAJINA Right. 

00:31:10
ERIC GREEN Umm… so, umm… a couple of, umm… skills that I just wanted to impart with you because we're going to do something next week called a family genogram. 

00:31:20
NAJINA Okay. 

00:31:20
ERIC GREEN And that's when, umm… I'm gonna have, umm… a sheet of paper and we're gonna draw out your family and then I'm gonna have you two pick sand miniatures that symbolize each person from your family tree and then we're going to talk about your family dynamics. That way I can, kind of, get an assessment of, kind of, where you all are feeling about things and it also helps the child do a playful form of describing his or her family in this case, Diggy's(ph) family. Umm… so a couple of skills that I just wanted to share with you, umm… might be, umm… it's something that we call, umm… encouraging versus praise. So if Diggy(ph) would put, umm… let's say that pine cone on the, on the family genogram where his grandmother is, let's say. And he might say, "Mom, what do you think how did I do?" Your natural instinct might be to say, "You did…" 

00:32:10
NAJINA You did a great job. 

00:32:10
ERIC GREEN Right, you did a great job, right. And that's praising, so we're praising him. What we want to do in family play is we want to encourage him because we want him to find an internal locus of control as opposed to looking externally for validation. So we might say, "Wow, you're really proud that you did that." Or we might say, umm… "You put that there." Umm… or we might say, umm… "You put a lot of effort into making that genogram." So we're acknowledging the effort instead of praising the products or the child. And I know that's probably very counterintuitive to what you do as a mother and I'm not asking you to change your parenting. Just within the, in the space here of family play, I want you to try out these kind of new skills. Another one might be, returning responsibility to the child. So if he says something like, "Mom, can you get that pencil for me?" Umm… you might say, umm… "You know what? I bet you, you can get it all by yourself." Umm… or if he says, "Mom, can you help me open this box of crayons? I can't get it." Then you might say, "Tell me what you like for me to do." Instead of just opening it for him, that helps him also develop an internal locus of control which can also help him get through these significant adjustments that he's facing. Do you have any questions about that? 

00:33:35
NAJINA No, it sounds really interesting. Umm… would like to try it. 

00:33:40
ERIC GREEN Okay, great. Umm… is there anything, uh, before we wrap up this for initial consultation, I don't want to overwhelm you with too much information. Is there one thing that you wanted to role-play with, just a brief like was something he might say or a question that you wanted to role-play about how to communicate something to him? 

00:33:55
NAJINA No, I think I'm more of a hands-on. I probably, visually need to just see it with him. 

00:34:00
ERIC GREEN Okay, great. 

00:34:00
NAJINA Yeah. 

00:34:00
ERIC GREEN So if that happens during the family play then, umm… if you don't mind I can, umm… help you, like I can do, umm… a support intervention while we're doing and I can say, uh, and then… Or I can just do it myself and then you can follow up with that and that way we will do live… 

00:34:15
NAJINA Great. 

00:34:20
ERIC GREEN All right. Thank you so much for coming in. I appreciate you providing me such, umm… honest and, and important details. And I know some of it was probably difficult to talk about, but know this is a safe place where you're not judged. And I'm looking forward to doing whatever I can to help you and your son get through this temporary difficult adjustment. 

00:34:40
NAJINA Thank you for taking the time to see us. And we look forward to working with you. 

00:34:40
ERIC GREEN You are welcome.
