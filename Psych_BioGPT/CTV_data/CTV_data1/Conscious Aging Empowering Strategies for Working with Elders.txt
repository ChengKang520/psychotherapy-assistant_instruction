Empowering Strategies for Working with Elders

Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:10
VANESSA JACKSON Hi, I am Vanessa Jackson, I'm a therapist in private practice in Atlanta, Georgia, and the co-editor of a new book "Understanding Power:A Human Services Imperative." And today, I'm gonna talk to you about working with elders, and the way I think about it, is conscious aging and sacred elder-hood. I think a lot of therapists when they think about working with people post 50 and certainly people in their '70s, '80s. We think about it as time of decline or a sadness and just loss. And as I start to understand working and have the experience in working with elders is it's a time of a lot of vibrant possibilities, it is a time of reflection, it's a time of letting uh… go, it's a time of thinking about the future and thinking about death and dying but there's so much uh… rich and textured understand that could happen in a clinical practice. And I think it's really important for all of us who work with adult populations to be able to be present and to provide opportunities for people to reflect on what their past has been, and to think about new possibilities, and things that are important uh… for them, and I believe in a legacy, oftentimes, when I'm talking to elders, it's a lot about uh… how is my life unfolded and if there are pieces that are still uh… to be uh… to unfold or to be experience like how do I help you do that? And how can therapy be a part of that process of building a legacy of grieving maybe aspects to yourself that didn't come to be your have been lost but to be able to sit umm… with people and, and talk with them and help them to understand that. And so when it's been a gift for me in working with uh… elders in my practice, for us to have conversations, especially, the really exciting part is when people start to see possibilities that they thought or maybe lost to them. And uh… so it becomes a, really… for me, an exciting part of it uh… as well as sitting with people around umm… the loss of parents and uh… how to be conscious even in that grieving and oftentimes that makes people think about their own mortality. And so how we can bring that into the consulting room in ways that gave people more choice to be thoughtful about how this is gonna unfold for them. Umm… and so I want to be able to share some of the work that I've done with my clients uh… with other therapist and, and certainly to invite people to think about the unique ways that they engage elders in their own practices 'cause I think it's a time in this third chapter of their life, third, maybe fourth chapter of their life. Umm… for a new understandings and an exchange of wisdom uh… but also are freeing when people are no longer tied to roles of parenting uh… maybe they have their own parents of transition and so there is both sadness but freedom. Uh…and so for me, it's like being able to help people think about, how do you wanna be with this time? And, and one of the things that I've done in that will… and that I use in my practice with people are set a card that I've created on Sacred Elderhood that are… it's a tool that I use with people so that they can maybe think about things, and think about this as a really expansive time in their life. Uh… and so I have people draw all these cards and there are questions on the cards that allow them to process things that might not come up normally… Uh… you almost have to and be, and sort of be invited into certain conversations about elder-hood. Umm.. and also embracing that term and sometimes I see people flinch, when I talk about elder-hood that they think of it as a decaying time and… and I think, I think of elder-hood as a time of wisdom and a time of freedom so I… in my practice wanna invite people to maybe get a new idea about there are new possibilities so this is some of the work that I'm doing. So we're going to introduce you in a few minutes to Donna. 

00:04:15
Introduction to counseling session 

00:04:15
VANESSA JACKSON I wanna introduce you to my client, Donna. And I wanna give you a little bit of background on her. Donna's in her 60s and she is someone who is both still parenting, a teenager at her home, has adult children, and also is really having to take a lot of responsibility for her parents. At this time in her life, she's also negotiating a life as a divorced person. So she's got lots of pressures, lots of layers into her life that she's coming to therapy and she's trying to understand dealing with the hurt and disappointment around the divorce but also the way that it shifts her life 'cause she was on one trajectory, for what, retirement and aging would look like. And this is thrown everything into sort of disarray and she's having to figure out how to negotiate taking care of parents, and children, and really still finding time for herself. And so that's what brings her to therapy and we're… and it's really my, my opportunity to help her to think about the pieces of her life that are changed and thinking about the new possibilities that could open up for her as she moves through times of loss and confusion. Okay, Donna, how are you doing? 

00:05:30
DONNA I'm doing okay. I'm doing okay. 

00:05:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. I'm hearing okay and then your face is saying something else so what's going on? 

00:05:35
DONNA Umm… Well, it's, it's been kind of a rough week, you know, things on the job have been really, really tough and I'm tired and then I just have to come home and get a call from my son who needs money 'cause he kind of, he's low for rent and I have to Uber to work 'cause I don't have a working car but then he needs it more than I do so I gave it to him. And then I also have to go, take dinner to my parents and it just seems like I'm a hamster in a wheel and there's just no way out. 

00:06:15
VANESSA JACKSON You're sandwiched. 

00:06:15
DONNA Yes. 

00:06:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:06:20
DONNA Very much so. 

00:06:20
VANESSA JACKSON This is what you thought that you'd be at this point in your life? 

00:06:25
DONNA No. No, I thought I would be able to share this with my husband that I could go to him, or maybe he could help our son, and then I can go to… I thought I would, I never ever pictured myself here, alone never, carrying everything by myself. 

00:06:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So one of the things we're gonna do is talk about in this moment, this is about you 'cause I'm here and a lot of taking care. 

00:06:50
DONNA I'm not used to focusing on me. 

00:06:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. Okay. And that's gonna be the hard part about this. 

00:07:00
DONNA It is… Even as you say it, my heart kind of goes… 

00:07:00
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. 

00:07:00
DONNA What? 

00:07:00
VANESSA JACKSON But… Yeah. But some of it is about saying like 'cause you got elderly parents. 

00:07:05
DONNA Uh-huh… 

00:07:10
VANESSA JACKSON You're at a place where slowing down.. 

00:07:10
DONNA Slowing down? What's that? 

00:07:15
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And being in partnership and so your life changed dramatically. 

00:07:15
DONNA It did, it did. 

00:07:20
VANESSA JACKSON And then having adult child that has needs. 

00:07:20
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:25
VANESSA JACKSON Umm… and then you revert to mom role… 

00:07:25
DONNA Yeah. 

00:07:25
VANESSA JACKSON And sacrifice. 

00:07:25
DONNA Yeah. 

00:07:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. As we're gonna talk a little bit about things like boundaries. 

00:07:35
DONNA Okay. 

00:07:35
VANESSA JACKSON And things about like asking for help. And finding enough balance. 

00:07:40
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
VANESSA JACKSON Uh… so that your sense of young elder-hood, can have a little bit more pleasure. Okay. 

00:07:50
DONNA It sounds good. 

00:07:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:07:55
DONNA But it's hard for me to envision that. 

00:08:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So one thing I wanna talk about is like you brought something up and I'm gonna go for fast. 

00:08:05
DONNA Okay. 

00:08:05
VANESSA JACKSON Is with your adult child? 

00:08:05
DONNA Yes. 

00:08:10
VANESSA JACKSON Who is quasi-independently? 

00:08:10
DONNA Quasi-independent? 

00:08:15
VANESSA JACKSON Doesn't live with you but you subsidize. 

00:08:20
DONNA Okay. But he's on his own. He's is living in… He's in LA right now. 

00:08:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And tell me about the part where you have a financial need and you subsidized. And I… Again I'm not judging, I'm just saying. 

00:08:30
DONNA Oh… 

00:08:35
VANESSA JACKSON That 'cause… It's like he is independent and he does live… 

00:08:35
DONNA Yes. 

00:08:35
VANESSA JACKSON Somewhere else but your still helping to finance, some of that to subsidize. 

00:08:45
DONNA Oh, he just rented little short this month. 

00:08:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. All right. So that's unusual. 

00:08:50
DONNA Well, no… 

00:08:50
VANESSA JACKSON Donna, I'm just looking at your face so it's not. So… I'm now seeing the push back. 

00:08:55
DONNA What do you mean push back? 

00:09:00
VANESSA JACKSON I was asking about like that quasi-independent and you were sort of like, lives on his own in LA. 

00:09:05
DONNA He does. 

00:09:05
VANESSA JACKSON But the piece of it is with some regularity, you have to subsidize or you choose to subsidize, it's call it with you… 

00:09:15
DONNA Okay. Yes. 

00:09:15
VANESSA JACKSON And so… 

00:09:15
DONNA 'Cause he's… he needs his rent 'cause if he doesn't, he will be kicked out. So… 

00:09:20
VANESSA JACKSON And if he got kicked out, what would happen? 

00:09:20
DONNA He might comeback with me. 

00:09:25
VANESSA JACKSON And what that would me like? 

00:09:25
DONNA Miserable. 

00:09:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So there is a reason, so there is a reason why you do that? 

00:09:30
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:30
VANESSA JACKSON Which is wanna to support and… but also how do you taught him about the fact, about the pressure that, that creates in your life? 

00:09:35
DONNA Well, he can't ask his father. 

00:09:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Okay. This is grown man, right? 

00:09:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:09:45
VANESSA JACKSON Your baby? 

00:09:45
DONNA Yes. 

00:09:45
VANESSA JACKSON He's a grown man. 

00:09:45
DONNA Yes. 

00:09:45
VANESSA JACKSON So the piece of it is, is that how does he know that mom has some pressures on her? And so that extra money that gets in creates pressure from mom? 

00:10:00
DONNA Well, he helps that when he can, you know, sometimes when he has it, he'll give me money for Uber. 

00:10:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And the pieces that I'm sort of nosing downside, we're finding issues is in part of what… for like how he helps. 

00:10:15
DONNA Yes. 

00:10:15
VANESSA JACKSON But that, there is also a lot of subsidizing? 

00:10:15
DONNA Yes. 

00:10:15
VANESSA JACKSON That you used to being mom, and you're used to be unable to help. And part of it as you… 

00:10:25
DONNA That's 'cause I find joy and fulfillment, that's who I am, was being a mom. That's where I find satisfaction. 

00:10:30
VANESSA JACKSON That's nice. And it's good and satisfying but as you age, you're gonna have to start thinking about your own elder-hood and what resources you need including the relationships. And, and also about launching, financially launching. I think you physically and emotionally launched a little bit, although I'm looking at your face now and I'm wondering if you even thinking about that. 

00:11:00
DONNA Well, when you say launching when he moved out that was launching. 

00:11:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Yeah. 

00:11:05
DONNA Right. 

00:11:05
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And so there's a little tethering and the reason why I'm breathing the money issue… 

00:11:10
DONNA Okay. 

00:11:10
VANESSA JACKSON … is because I'm hearing you also sort of speak of your… And we've talked about in other sessions about it. 

00:11:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:11:15
VANESSA JACKSON Some of your financial stress. 

00:11:15
DONNA Yeah. I got a lot of that. 

00:11:15
VANESSA JACKSON With the divorce and so your… 

00:11:20
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
VANESSA JACKSON Situation is not what it was before. 

00:11:20
DONNA No, It's like poverty level. 

00:11:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so here is a piece. So how do you shift like in your '60s where you weren't planning on being at the page, right? 

00:11:35
DONNA No… 

00:11:35
VANESSA JACKSON And financially, it's very different and you don't wanna give up role, which is a generous loving mom, right? 

00:11:45
DONNA Yeah. 

00:11:45
VANESSA JACKSON At the same time that's beginning to further financially destabilize you as you trying to recover from a divorce. 

00:11:50
DONNA I never thought about it like that. 

00:11:55
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's a big change, it wasn't the life that you envisioned. 

00:12:00
DONNA No. 

00:12:00
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's… 

00:12:00
DONNA And that makes me mad at my ex-husband. 

00:12:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:12:05
DONNA 'Cause we wouldn't be here if he hadn't went off with another woman and… it's all his fault, anyway. So if my son needs help… 

00:12:10
VANESSA JACKSON You're gonna show him love. 

00:12:15
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:15
VANESSA JACKSON You're gonna be the better parent. 

00:12:15
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:12:15
DONNA Because he doesn't need to lose both of us. 

00:12:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. There is a piece and maybe there's a way about… So one of these we got come back as we cover things, one is, there is this hurt. 

00:12:25
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:25
VANESSA JACKSON And we'll make sure that you hurt's not causing to sabotage, the rest of your life. 

00:12:30
DONNA What do you mean? 

00:12:30
VANESSA JACKSON 'Cause you said it's his fault. 

00:12:35
DONNA It is. 

00:12:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Make some choices. And so we can talk about what you could control about that and what you couldn't… 

00:12:40
DONNA Okay. 

00:12:40
VANESSA JACKSON But more importantly, we gotta talk about how it is gonna shape how you move forward? Okay. 

00:12:50
DONNA It's scary. 

00:12:50
VANESSA JACKSON I know. It's a little stop right there. 

00:12:50
DONNA That's a scary thought. 

00:12:50
VANESSA JACKSON You should be angry with him. 

00:12:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:12:50
VANESSA JACKSON Then to be scared about umm… you're shifting relationship… 

00:13:00
DONNA Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:00
VANESSA JACKSON And if he start to umm… has he becomes more independent, he doesn't need you in the, that kind of mother role but he's always turn to his mom. 

00:13:10
DONNA Yeah. But, you know, when you just said that my heart clenched, the thought of him not needing me because if he doesn't need me, then who am I? 

00:13:20
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. Here is this wonderful opportunity that I know doesn't… When your heart clutches, it doesn't feel like a wonderful opportunity? Is to begin to ask myself that, at this phase of my life, who do I… who am I, and who do I want to be? 

00:13:30
DONNA Yeah. 

00:13:35
VANESSA JACKSON So if there's an opportunity to begin, to imagine something different. 

00:13:40
DONNA But that still scary. 

00:13:40
VANESSA JACKSON Absolutely. 

00:13:40
DONNA 'Cause I have no clue. 

00:13:45
VANESSA JACKSON It's absolutely scary so that's why I wanna make sure that we can spend time talking about your hurt of the divorce. 

00:13:50
DONNA Okay. 

00:13:50
VANESSA JACKSON But then we also spend some time beginning to imagine who you are beyond that? And who you are in the next 10, 15, 20 years that doesn't have to just be sad. 

00:14:00
DONNA Umm… 

00:14:05
VANESSA JACKSON Do you even imagine? 

00:14:05
DONNA No. 

00:14:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. But I wanna take a moment. 

00:14:05
DONNA Right now, I can't. 

00:14:10
VANESSA JACKSON I wanna take a moment to imagine it and it's really kind of weird that I'm ask you to imagine it, when you feel so hurt and broken about it. 

00:14:15
DONNA Yeah, yeah. That's good. Yeah. I feel broken. 

00:14:20
VANESSA JACKSON You feel broken and so it means that with, it moves differently umm… 'cause we got to honor that it feels kind of broken and then it is, marriage was broken, identity was broken in life. 

00:14:30
DONNA Yeah. Definitely. 

00:14:35
VANESSA JACKSON And then financially a really big drop in being, really comfortable into suddenly struggling in a way that you hadn't had to struggle. 

00:14:40
DONNA Right. 

00:14:45
VANESSA JACKSON In the years. 

00:14:45
DONNA Right. 

00:14:45
VANESSA JACKSON As you're sort of moving toward like retirement like something is that, your not having to reposition financially? 

00:14:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:14:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so that's scary. 

00:14:55
DONNA Yeah. 

00:14:55
VANESSA JACKSON At the same time, I don't wanna miss the fact that there is this opportunity to talk about, who am I really? And I think this time is also… even when things are broken is how you wanna reassemble it. Do you wanna make the picture look exactly the way it was before? 

00:15:15
DONNA No. I don't think I do. 

00:15:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so if there is opportunity to think about aspects of yourself desires that maybe you got set aside, when you became a parent or a wife and that to be able to bring that back into play. 

00:15:30
DONNA Yeah. 

00:15:30
VANESSA JACKSON And so we got to… Think about being conscious and as we age. 

00:15:35
DONNA It's been buried so long because I was staying home full time wife and mom that was my job. That was my aspiration. 

00:15:45
VANESSA JACKSON What was, what was, what was this… Okay. And that's great. And you got to do that for a long time, right? 

00:15:50
DONNA I did. But it wasn't… it was fulfilling but not as fulfilling as I thought it would be. 

00:15:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So there were any other sort of parts in yourself that maybe you were set aside, why you stepped into that role, lived into that role? 

00:16:05
DONNA School. 

00:16:10
VANESSA JACKSON Like what? 

00:16:10
DONNA You know, I wanted to be, umm… I wanted to be a physical therapist and… umm… so I had to let that go. And then I thought about being a teacher too. So I kind of was able to do that by home schooling my kids. 

00:16:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:16:30
DONNA But now that they're grown I have… you know, now I'm working at a healthcare facility for seniors, just to bring in some money but it doesn't, it doesn't fulfill me. 

00:16:45
VANESSA JACKSON So here is a piece, you're working in a healthcare serving for seniors? 

00:16:45
DONNA Yeah. 

00:16:50
VANESSA JACKSON And so where it happened to the physical therapist part? 

00:16:55
DONNA That I would take… I want it all to go back to school. 

00:16:55
VANESSA JACKSON Wow, really? 

00:16:55
DONNA Yeah. 

00:17:00
VANESSA JACKSON Say more about that. 

00:17:00
DONNA Because… Just… I haven't been school in 50… 50 plus years. So the thought of A, finances to be able to afford it. B, trying to able to be maintain, I don't think my mind would remember all those school stuff and writing. No… 

00:17:25
VANESSA JACKSON It's okay. It's okay. So you brought up all your fears. 

00:17:25
DONNA Yes. 

00:17:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. But I just want to for a minute to put the fears aside, they're here, screaming, right. 

00:17:35
DONNA Really loud. 

00:17:35
VANESSA JACKSON Really loud. 

00:17:35
DONNA Yeah. 

00:17:35
VANESSA JACKSON But 'cause you immediately you went to panic mode. 

00:17:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:17:40
VANESSA JACKSON Then you gave me a barrage of excuses for why you can't do this. 

00:17:40
DONNA Reasons, reasons. 

00:17:45
VANESSA JACKSON Tell me the difference. 

00:17:45
DONNA Excuses, sound like I'm trying to run away from something. Reason is a valid statement of a truth. 

00:17:55
VANESSA JACKSON Really? 

00:17:55
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:17:55
VANESSA JACKSON That you're absolute to low or you're… you're brain can't function, you'd never be able to finance it, you can't sit the classes, and that's absolute unadulterated truth, really? 

00:18:05
DONNA Okay. Maybe not, but definitely the financial part. 

00:18:10
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. We'll talk about that piece. 

00:18:10
DONNA Okay. 

00:18:10
VANESSA JACKSON But the thing about that is so but before we've even go down that road, is that role as physical therapist something… So as hasn't any passion for you. 

00:18:20
DONNA I don't think so. 

00:18:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 'cause again, you're being in a healthcare environment… 

00:18:25
DONNA Yeah. 

00:18:25
VANESSA JACKSON You get to see a little bit more and so I want to just check and see if that doesn't have the same kind of passion doesn't have the same kind of passion then you would just say, that that's not the same kind of passion, that's a piece of data. 

00:18:35
DONNA Yeah. 

00:18:40
VANESSA JACKSON But if there's something else in there that says… but this thing… I don't care 'cause I wanna be a cal-girl, it's like what's a piece in you that still looks to be fulfilled? 

00:18:50
DONNA I think there's a piece in me that I would love to be able to go back and help other women who, whose husbands live them then if I could maybe be a counselor. 

00:19:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:19:10
DONNA That kind of… The thought of that kind of excites me more than being a physical therapist. 

00:19:10
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And I think, you know, sometimes like being in a place thinking you're in a, in an environment where you could see physical therapist world… 

00:19:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:19:20
VANESSA JACKSON And you go, well, that's again a nice thought. 

00:19:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:19:20
VANESSA JACKSON But that doesn't really raise up for me this excitement because there are steps that you would have to take. 

00:19:30
DONNA Right. 

00:19:30
VANESSA JACKSON And you begin to think about how do I get training? 

00:19:30
DONNA Yeah. 

00:19:35
VANESSA JACKSON Umm… to do this thing that would be how passion and meaning for me. 

00:19:35
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:40
VANESSA JACKSON Because now I know if I'm little experienced how disorienting. 

00:19:40
DONNA Yeah. 

00:19:45
VANESSA JACKSON It is. And it might be something that I could do and that would give me some more financial security. 

00:19:50
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:50
VANESSA JACKSON And but there would also possibly can be some joy. 

00:19:55
DONNA Joy. 

00:20:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. You said that, you know, tell me more about the way… 

00:20:00
DONNA Because it's almost to me, joy, just seems like a word in a dictionary. 

00:20:05
VANESSA JACKSON When was the last time you felt it? 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:15
DONNA I still trying to… Uh… Christmas, when all of my kids came home. 

00:20:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So and tell me about that, that moment of being with your kids and feeling that joy. 

00:20:30
DONNA That, that is, that's what I live for. The, the connection and the fun, and the laughter, and all my chickadees are into the roof and I get to cook and clean for them and it's just the laughter and I'm not alone. 

00:20:45
VANESSA JACKSON Here is… That's a… You raise a big piece like you lit up, did you notice that you kind of lit up? 

00:20:50
DONNA Yeah. I could feel the joy from that memory. 

00:20:55
VANESSA JACKSON And so it makes me think about, like when you're in a place of worry, worried by your son, worried by your own finances, not feeling fulfilling in work that you're doing… 

00:21:05
DONNA Right. 

00:21:05
VANESSA JACKSON Is that… then you start talk about this other way of being. 

00:21:10
DONNA Yeah. 

00:21:10
VANESSA JACKSON That is surrounded and connected, nurturing and getting back this love. 

00:21:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:21:15
VANESSA JACKSON And began to think as like how where other ways that you could recreate that in your daily life. Maybe not that everyday can't be Christmas but… 

00:21:25
DONNA Uh… That would be so nice. 

00:21:30
VANESSA JACKSON But to be able to say like is there are then things that you might wanna do? That might be part of your work that involve connection 'cause I also heard the part about loneliness and that's the one of the tricky parts about aging… 

00:21:45
DONNA Yeah. 

00:21:45
VANESSA JACKSON Is that you start loosing people or you're anticipating loosing people. 

00:21:50
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:21:50
VANESSA JACKSON And with the divorce you loose a companion. 

00:21:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:21:55
VANESSA JACKSON And so loneliness is what's really a central theme of aging that we have to attend to, it doesn't have to be lonely but we have to attend to it so that you don't get, what… on what author referred to the lethality of loneliness and that's what kills people. 

00:22:10
DONNA Oh… And that's… 

00:22:10
VANESSA JACKSON People get disconnected and people get isolated. 

00:22:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:22:15
VANESSA JACKSON And which you… and you are a person that likes other people. 

00:22:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:22:20
VANESSA JACKSON So you've got to be really attentive to staying connected. 

00:22:25
DONNA But it is so hard 'cause I'm so exhausted by the end of the day that when I get invitations to go places I find…. Oh… Okay, I can say excuses. 

00:22:35
VANESSA JACKSON Let's just try that one more time… I know… And again I was trying to make funny or anything. 

00:22:40
DONNA Yeah. 

00:22:40
VANESSA JACKSON Or call you out. 

00:22:40
DONNA Yeah. 

00:22:40
VANESSA JACKSON But to say that it's so easy to find a lot of reasons not to do it… 

00:22:45
DONNA I do… 

00:22:45
VANESSA JACKSON 'Cause you're so tired. And then, you know, then you wanna explain to people that you're just so tired right? 

00:22:50
DONNA Yeah. But I wonder if it's, you know, 'cause when I'm tired I still go out and do for my kids. But when it comes to socializing or hanging out, there is a part in me that wants to do it but what if they ask me how I'm doing, or what if they ask me about my husband or what. And so there is a part of me that's just like it's just safer to stay at home. 

00:23:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and so now we see that's not a reason, that's an excuse, right? 

00:23:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:23:25
VANESSA JACKSON And part of it… and so now… But here is a piece then about being able to say that I don't wanna isolate myself because that creates much bigger problems. But I also, I'm really afraid of people ask me about things that would really hit the places of pain. 

00:23:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:23:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And it's okay. 

00:23:40
DONNA Yeah. 

00:23:40
VANESSA JACKSON So it's all right to say as I begin to move back out and create this life as a divorce person that I can be gentle with myself about whose company I'm in. So I could start out with the people, who get that's hard for me. 

00:23:55
DONNA Yeah. 

00:24:00
VANESSA JACKSON And who really that creates space for me, to be sad if they ask. All right, angry if they ask. 

00:24:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:24:05
VANESSA JACKSON Or when the people say, we get it this is a moment where you're trying to step outside of that story. 

00:24:10
DONNA Right. Yes. 

00:24:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so being… able to think who are the people that are easiest to be around, they give you the sense of connection 'cause again you wanna be real attentive and as we all do as we age about… Making sure we stay connected but not like frantic running around… 

00:24:30
DONNA Right. 

00:24:30
VANESSA JACKSON Where you don't want to plead it. 

00:24:35
DONNA Right, right, right. 

00:24:35
VANESSA JACKSON But like authentically connected with people that help you feel alive. 

00:24:40
DONNA I have a friend like that but she lives an hour away. 

00:24:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:24:45
DONNA So it's kind of hard to connect with her as much as I would like. 

00:24:50
VANESSA JACKSON And, and so I wanna a… 

00:24:50
DONNA Okay. 

00:24:55
VANESSA JACKSON Go down, so thinking about they're an hour away, which isn't mars. 

00:25:00
DONNA No. 

00:25:00
VANESSA JACKSON And there's phones? 

00:25:00
DONNA Yes. 

00:25:00
VANESSA JACKSON And you talk on the phone often? 

00:25:00
DONNA Yes. 

00:25:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Good. 

00:25:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:25:05
VANESSA JACKSON And when you have those conversations on the phone what's that like? 

00:25:10
DONNA Umm…I get to laugh, I get to laugh. 

00:25:15
VANESSA JACKSON And how badly do you need to laugh? 

00:25:15
DONNA A lot. 

00:25:20
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. 

00:25:20
DONNA Really badly. 

00:25:20
VANESSA JACKSON So how often do you guys talk? 

00:25:20
DONNA Her schedule is busy like mine so maybe twice, three times a month or so… 

00:25:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So here is a thing about umm… busy but it might also be busy, in a way, but if you said, "Look, I'm going through a hard time and I need to… it would really helpful if I could talk to you at least, two times a week." 

00:25:45
DONNA She'd do it. But it's hard for me to ask. 

00:25:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay but this is why I wanna sort of cut through that. 

00:25:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:25:50
VANESSA JACKSON I suspect it. 

00:25:55
DONNA You suspect it right. 

00:25:55
VANESSA JACKSON That she would do it for you, as you would do it for her. 

00:25:55
DONNA She will, absolutely. 

00:26:00
VANESSA JACKSON And so let's go back to saying like you gone through something that's like a loss, like a dad. 

00:26:05
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:05
VANESSA JACKSON And you also have a lot of pressures but wanna making sure kids are okay in the world. 

00:26:10
DONNA Yeah. 

00:26:10
VANESSA JACKSON And adjusting to that new role is being… 

00:26:15
DONNA Right. 

00:26:15
VANESSA JACKSON The mother of an adult person. 

00:26:15
DONNA And I have 15-year-old at home too. 

00:26:20
VANESSA JACKSON Oh, dear. And so you're like, you're like a triple-decker sandwich. 

00:26:25
DONNA Yeah. 

00:26:25
VANESSA JACKSON You got adult kids, you've got teenager, and you've got aging parents. 

00:26:35
DONNA Yes. 

00:26:35
VANESSA JACKSON And you're in a place where you're… in so as always recreating yourself. 

00:26:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:26:40
VANESSA JACKSON You know, and begin to think about aging but being young elder. 

00:26:45
DONNA Yeah. 

00:26:45
VANESSA JACKSON And, and you flingered at the time is say, elder. 

00:26:50
DONNA 'Cause that doesn't feel right. 

00:26:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Then it is okay. 

00:26:55
DONNA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON But at the same time it does speak to some, where you're at your life today. 

00:27:00
DONNA Right, right. 

00:27:00
VANESSA JACKSON And so say look but this is also, this what it's actually looks like. 

00:27:05
DONNA Good. 

00:27:05
VANESSA JACKSON What about that? 

00:27:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:27:05
VANESSA JACKSON Thank you. Like, it looks good. 

00:27:05
DONNA Yeah. 

00:27:05
VANESSA JACKSON This is what, like black don't crack, I'm almost like… 

00:27:05
DONNA That's right, that's right. 

00:27:10
VANESSA JACKSON And you do have your health and you do umm… 

00:27:10
DONNA I do. 

00:27:15
VANESSA JACKSON Have family that you pick members that you love and do have thoughts about here's an opportunity to go back and maybe pick up some things even though it's scary. 

00:27:25
DONNA Right. 

00:27:25
VANESSA JACKSON Umm… and to be, you know, negotiating a teenager. And but to saying what is it that that I need, which means you need your friends more than ever. 

00:27:35
DONNA Yeah. 

00:27:35
VANESSA JACKSON Which is why we… So when I'd lay out… Okay, I got a teenager, I got adult kids, when we're trying to get their footing in difficult economic times, I'm negotiating divorce, I got my parents in there, they're like '80s and so it's like… so what… Doesn't that sound like a person that deserves a little support? 

00:27:55
DONNA It does but until you bring it up its almost like there's no room in my thought process. 

00:28:00
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. 

00:28:00
DONNA I don't really fit in there. 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And, and so here is thing like you said you don't show up. It's so… That's a pretty crowded field. 

00:28:10
DONNA It is. 

00:28:10
VANESSA JACKSON So we had to sort of pull for the ease a little bit and have people stand back so that you get more central. 'Cause this, this is a time of great power and that's when I say elder, I think it's an amazing time. 

00:28:20
DONNA Okay. 

00:28:20
VANESSA JACKSON Because you've got some life under your power. You know some things that you didn't know at 20, when we thought we knew everything, right? 

00:28:30
DONNA Great. 

00:28:30
VANESSA JACKSON Umm… Anyhow there's still a lot of life so there's opportunities to do more. 

00:28:35
DONNA It feels good to hear you say that, almost validate what's kind of been an hidden feeling. 

00:28:45
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. 

00:28:45
DONNA That I just didn't give place to. 

00:28:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And that's I wanted to… and it's also gonna be, you know, a journey of helping other people here, place to it. Because, you know, your kids have been well trained to come to you. 

00:28:55
DONNA Yeah. 

00:29:00
VANESSA JACKSON So when start to say mom is not available right now 'cause she is either talking her friends, getting some support or… in school or is doing something including like sitting here being quite with yourself. 

00:29:10
DONNA Oh, that would be wonderful. 

00:29:10
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, first couple of times you're gonna give some push back. 

00:29:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:29:15
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's about being able to set boundaries to say, but it's also about moiling for those kids. 

00:29:20
DONNA Yeah. 

00:29:20
VANESSA JACKSON 'Cause someday they're gonna be in the same, puny issues. 

00:29:25
DONNA Yeah. 

00:29:25
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's about you having giving yourself permission. And in part of that is going back as we start… as you said thinking like since you're remaking your life. 

00:29:35
DONNA Yeah. 

00:29:35
VANESSA JACKSON …is thinking about pieces from your, you know, we talked about the elder good card and you pulled one. 

00:29:40
DONNA Yeah. I did. 

00:29:40
VANESSA JACKSON And again, we've got to talk a little bit about card. 

00:29:45
DONNA Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:29:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so the card did you pull about maybe there are magic… 

00:29:45
DONNA I have it right now. 

00:29:50
VANESSA JACKSON 'Cause they… you tend to pull what you need to process. 

00:29:50
DONNA Right. 

00:29:50
VANESSA JACKSON Which one did you pull? 

00:29:55
DONNA It says "What hopes and dreams from my youth still need to be fulfilled from me to be at peace." 

00:30:00
VANESSA JACKSON So I just want you to take that answer, you think about first of all like, what are… are there any hopes and dreams that either God put down or haven't been given full expression that will be really wonderful and enlightening for you to bring into your right now, from your youth. 

00:30:20
DONNA I think from my youth I imagined myself financially independent. But I also imagined myself as accomplishing something and I think that's the missing peace. Because I… at this stage of my life I feel like… I mean, what would they even put on my tombstone? Yeah, I would be good to hear mom but now I won't even say wife and mom but then what else? It's like, like who, who am I? And that's what I wanted do. I wanna be able to say at the end of my life, I am Donna and I did this. 

00:31:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So let's think about what would be those things. What could let you say that with that kind of like… I came into my… I came into world, I did this thing that was such the essence of Donna, that was why I was brought in to this world, what would that be? 

00:31:20
DONNA Right now it would be… I took something that broke me and was able to put it back together and then because I was broken, I was able to help other broken people get fixed. 

00:31:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so it goes back so you see, you then you started thinking about this piece that you want to do, with other women who divorced. 

00:31:40
DONNA Yeah. 

00:31:40
VANESSA JACKSON You know, later in life when they thought that they things were settled, right? 'Cause you're gonna write it up, this person even if he wasn't like what you wanted… 

00:31:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:31:50
VANESSA JACKSON So let's think about the ways that you could make that happen, with or without going back to college time, I might like that, so what are the ways that you'd like to show up in the lives of other women? 

00:32:00
DONNA They kind of call me, already. 

00:32:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:32:05
DONNA You know, at church, they know kind of our story and or their friends who know me, tell them to give me a call so I'm kind of doing it umm… informally. 

00:32:20
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. You sound like you have a peer counseling, an unpaid peer counseling. 

00:32:25
DONNA That… There you go, there you go. But it feels good to be able to do it but I never thought of being able to, I don't know make something out of it. 

00:32:35
VANESSA JACKSON Well, it depends so… and you raised two things, both the calling of it that I'm called on to share my story. 

00:32:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:32:40
VANESSA JACKSON That actually gives me a sense of power when I talk about power-based stuff, it's like one of the healing process, there's not only do you move through a difficult experience but you get to a place where you know something better about yourself. 

00:32:55
DONNA Yes. 

00:32:55
VANESSA JACKSON And that you also can then offer to someone else and that's when healing is complete. When I can take the thing that broke me. Have remade myself and then offer it back to some else as a path for their own healing. 

00:33:05
DONNA That's what that… 

00:33:05
VANESSA JACKSON You're already doing it, Donna. 

00:33:10
DONNA Yeah. Oh, I guess I am. 

00:33:15
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And so… if you slow down certainly know that I'm already doing it. And it brings you joy and I bet even when you're tired at the end of the day. And the phone rings that some women reaching out, what happens to you? 

00:33:35
DONNA I find energy that I didn't know it was there and before I know it I feel alive. 

00:33:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And that's what you wanna do, you wanna be like… And then, in fact, the thing that broke your heart has opened up a path, bring you to this thing that would bring you so much joy, it would keep you connected, it would break the isolation of other women. 

00:34:00
DONNA Yeah. That's true. 

00:34:00
VANESSA JACKSON And it would give you sense of purpose. 

00:34:05
DONNA That's true. Now if I could find a way that it would help me get some finances… 

00:34:10
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, here's a piece so what if you put together a group and you charge people? 

00:34:15
DONNA But I don't have a degree or, or anything. 

00:34:20
VANESSA JACKSON You don't have to name yourself… I'm saying is that let's not go for excuses let's figure out. How valuable is your time? 

00:34:30
DONNA I've never placed price on it. 

00:34:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. But here's piece about it and some of it, you'd say that there's some stuff I don't feel comfortable doing as a therapist and maybe I do wanna get that training or maybe I'll find a way to do that training or it could be that I could do a support group and, and charge as a, as a coach or as a consultant, or as a guide, or as a whatever. But it would be a way to do the thing that love and also addresses other challenge that have. 

00:35:00
DONNA Yeah. 

00:35:00
VANESSA JACKSON And it might be time for you correcting that's a beautiful part about what umm… there's a great book called umm… "The Third Chapter", by woman Sarah Lawrence like put that she is able… she's a beautiful writer and sociologist but what she does is she really captures the stories of people, they go back or either discovers something new, post 50. 

00:35:25
DONNA Okay. 

00:35:25
VANESSA JACKSON And go back and pick up something that got that set down. 

00:35:25
DONNA Oh… 

00:35:25
VANESSA JACKSON And so but it's like the thing that lights you up. 

00:35:30
DONNA Yeah. 

00:35:30
VANESSA JACKSON And so that will be enable to be a guide uh… and help women, find themselves again. 

00:35:40
DONNA I like that. 

00:35:40
VANESSA JACKSON And how much meaning with would that have for you? 

00:35:45
DONNA A lot. I really like that idea. 

00:35:50
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And so do you see the possibilities now? 

00:35:50
DONNA I do. 

00:35:50
VANESSA JACKSON Like… And how does it feel like checking it all, feels the things that I could do this thing that would have so much meaning, get me connected, use the thing that broke my heart as a tool for liberation for somebody else and possibly for money in my purse. 

00:36:05
DONNA Girl, that would be the bomb.com. 

00:36:10
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And so that the piece of it is like and so does it sound more possible before you like… 

00:36:15
DONNA Ìt does, it, it really feels… I guess when I started trapped like I would be in sadness forever, right. But now it feels like there in an escape hatch. 

00:36:30
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And escape hatch, you need to take out, you should take out what you brought with you. 

00:36:35
DONNA Yeah. 

00:36:35
VANESSA JACKSON And then you get to build a community 'cause what… when you start talking and even about your child out, when she's decides stop fight me about supporting his grown person umm… is that, you know, that's who you are. And to be generous and loving and supporter of this, it's just so much of who you are. 

00:36:50
DONNA Yeah. 

00:36:55
VANESSA JACKSON And you don't want this experience to take that away. 

00:36:55
DONNA No. 

00:36:55
VANESSA JACKSON And you got to repurpose it in a way that it strengthens you and other people. 

00:37:00
DONNA Yeah. 

00:37:00
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's like really being able to think about like, "Okay, how can I do that? And how much… And what's the next step?" 

00:37:10
DONNA Right. 

00:37:10
VANESSA JACKSON And I think that's a piece like what's the next step like I could be able to do something that would be fabulous, right? 

00:37:15
DONNA Yeah. 

00:37:20
VANESSA JACKSON And make you a lot happier. 

00:37:20
DONNA That would be nice. 

00:37:20
VANESSA JACKSON Then you'd have more energy at the end of the day… 

00:37:25
DONNA That would be better. 

00:37:25
VANESSA JACKSON So now that you see new possibilities, right? 

00:37:25
DONNA Yes. 

00:37:30
VANESSA JACKSON And so how is it feel now, sitting here from when you walked in the door? 

00:37:30
DONNA A lot better. 

00:37:35
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. Much more possibilities, much more energy. 

00:37:40
DONNA Yes. 

00:37:40
VANESSA JACKSON And there's still some hard work to do like we're gonna have to do boundary set. 

00:37:45
DONNA I'm glad, I have to try to do this by myself. 

00:37:45
VANESSA JACKSON And you can do it by yourself. And I think if you still want to start really sharing with people like your friend that you're gonna… 

00:37:50
DONNA Yes. That's my homework, I will call her and ask her. 

00:37:55
VANESSA JACKSON Is that… And she can be your buddy in this 'cause it's again, it's, it's applies something that could benefit her as well but you're gonna practice as asking for what you need 'cause you're so used to be in the one. 

00:38:05
DONNA Yes. 

00:38:05
VANESSA JACKSON To, to do others. 

00:38:05
DONNA Yes. 

00:38:10
VANESSA JACKSON That you haven't been asking for what you are and I just said you got a very layered life and so this an opportunity for you start asking for what you need. 

00:38:20
DONNA Okay. 

00:38:20
VANESSA JACKSON All right. 

00:38:20
DONNA I'll do that. I got it. Thank you. 

00:38:25
VANESSA JACKSON Bye, bye. 

00:38:25
DONNA Bye.

VANESSA JACKSON I wanna pull up a couple of reflections from this session with Donna and one of is as how we transformed excuses into possibilities and even though there might was a like initially some a little defensiveness about excuses versus reasons. It was this… as we move through the session and talked and gave her time to talk, you know, sort of explore what she felt and what she was attempting to do umm… and her explanations for why things couldn't happen is that she start to see that, "Oh, there is more possibilities and that she was then able to monitor her own resistance and her own excuses. And so that and that word excuses, which could be very loaded, suddenly opened up a path for her to talk about possibilities, at the same time, honoring her fears. And so I think it's looking at those moments that I can get hard in a therapy session but also that Nash has got a new tool that she listens with a new ear uh… about when she starts to feel constricted and, and can then in her own way transform and open up those possibilities. I think its also very exciting for her to go from a place of a lot of confusion and even almost despair about her situation to actually enthusiasm in the course of even one session, where she is able to see through a different lands what her… What might be possible for her and to reengage with both old hopes, hopes from her youth that could now be used to inspire her as she moves forward took look maybe a scary future for her in many ways but also one is filled with much more possibilities and when she started the session.
