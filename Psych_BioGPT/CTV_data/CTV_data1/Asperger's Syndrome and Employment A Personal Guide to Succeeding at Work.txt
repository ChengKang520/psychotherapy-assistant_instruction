Asperger's Syndrome and Employment A Personal Guide to Succeeding at Work 

00:00:00
Featuring Nick Dubin 

00:00:05
NICK DUBIN I'd like this program to serve as a guide for anyone who has Asperger's Syndrome to, um, understand maybe what are some of the pitfalls of jobs and what are some of the things to look for in terms of what kind of job would be good for them. And in doing so, I'm gonna use my life as an example. Not that my life is the complete guide, but it will hopefully serve as an example for people on the spectrum to understand what went well for me and what hasn't over the years. 

00:00:30
With Commentary by Gail Hawkins 

00:00:30
GAIL HAWKINS I think that there is a high rate of unemployment and underemployment for people with Asperger's Syndrome. I don't think it has to be that way. There's a number of factors that, uh, that come together to make that statistic the way it is. I think one is that there's a lack of understanding and, and knowledge and, um, education about Asperger's Syndrome. Um, people don't even know what that is in general. 

00:01:00
Introduction 

00:01:05
NICK DUBIN Well, my name is Nick Dubin. I'm, uh, currently 29 years old. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome two years ago, and getting that diagnosis was really a relief in a lot of different ways. Uh, I always felt different as a child, growing up. Um, I had many different labels, ADD, Written Expression Disorder, but I never could really make sense of it on top of the fact that I had trouble relating to people socially, uh, primarily at school. So getting the diagnosis and understanding what had been happening to me all these years was a huge relief.

GAIL HAWKINS We're all born with gifts, and Asperger's Syndrome, I think, is a gift. Uh, it's a gift of being able to see the world, perceive the world differently in a way that people that are neurotypical, as, uh, we like to be called, I guess, or people like to call us, don't see it. And I think that's, um, a unique, uh, gift to have. Many incredibly wonderful things have come out of those minds, and, uh, inventions, things that have brought us to the place we are today in society. 

00:02:10
NICK DUBIN Gail Hawkins is probably the leading person in the world in terms of helping people with Asperger's Syndrome find employment. She's written a critically acclaimed book through Jessica Kingsley.

00:02:20
GAIL HAWKINS I met Nick, um, probably about six months ago. Uh, we were both speaking at the same conference. Nick spoke before I did, and, um, I had the opportunity to listen to him, and I was just absolutely in awe. I thought, "Wow, this is a guy that's really got it together. He's really putting his heart out there." And I think when anybody puts their heart out there in front of a group of people and becomes vul-, vulnerable, when I truly respect it, and it just, my heart opens up. And I went up to Nick afterward, uh, and just told him how much I enjoyed listening to him, and I truly did. I thought, this is a very brave person who has an inner strength to go out there and talk about, um, how his life has been so tough and yet, his underlying message is how he's overcoming that. That message really needs to get out there to, um, people with Asperger's Syndrome, that preserve and it will, you, you can turn things around. You can be successful. 

00:03:30
Conference on Asperger's & Employment Speakers Included Nick Dubin & Gail Hawkins 

00:03:30
NICK DUBIN I'm gonna be talking mainly about my experiences, uh, with employment. Um, that's basically gonna be the second part of my presentation, and I really wanna talk more about that than some of the generalities in terms of Asperger's and employment because I know that, uh, Gail Hawkins and Sally Burton-Hoyle are gonna do a really good job of that. So most of my presentation is gonna be based about my own experience, um, in the employment ring for the past ten or so years. 

00:03:55

00:03:55
GAIL HAWKINS Asperger's Syndrome is a neurological disorder that affects social skills and communication and the way that an individual processes information. It, um, makes it difficult for a person to build relationships and relate easily to other people. 

00:04:15
Age 3 

00:04:15
NICK DUBIN When I was a child, my parents noticed that there were a few things that were different about me. Uh, for example, when they used to take me to the park and I would go up the slide, I wouldn't want anyone near me. I wouldn't want anyone going on the slide at the same time I was going down the slide. So they noticed things related to, uh, social uneasiness. They noticed jumping and flapping in terms of uncontrollable motor movements. And at that time, I was currently nonverbal. 

00:04:40

00:04:40
GAIL HAWKINS Asperger's Syndrome is not a disability in terms of intelligence. Um, generally speaking, you'll find that most people who have Asperger's Syndrome are highly intelligent. Where I think it, um, the stumbling block is is in the area of common sense, in the area of social intelligence. 

00:05:05

Using Special Interests or Talents 

00:05:10
GAIL HAWKINS Finding an appropriate job goal or a career goal is really important in the whole process of finding work. And there's a, there's, um, a process to doing that. You have to really look at your interests, your fascinations and see what are ones that can be applied to the real world. 

00:05:30
age 14 yrs. 

00:05:30
NICK DUBIN As a kid, uh, it was quite an anomaly that I was a good tennis player because I had always gross and fine motor deficits up until the time that I picked up a tennis racket. So my dad tried to take me to a baseball practice which I didn't do real well in, I didn't stay. Um, my dad tried to get me to do swimming which I was decent at, but I didn't continue with it. But, uh, when I took a tennis lesson, I really fell in love with tennis. I wasn't real great at first, but I really enjoyed it, and my first tennis lesson was with a guy named Tighe Keating at the Birmingham Racquet Club. 

00:06:00
Tighe Keating Certified Tennis Pro 

00:06:05
TIGHE KEATING I met Nick when he was probably 10 or 11 years old, and I remember him being brought to the tennis program by, I believe, the mother, and just experimented signing up for once a week program just to see if he liked it. And he had, uh, expressed that he liked it and he had an interest. And one of the things we noticed about him at the time was that he had a real knack for it. 

00:06:35
NICK DUBIN At Seaholm High School I played number one singles on my varsity tennis team for four years, and I made all-state my senior year. And then I went on to Grand Valley and I played number one singles my freshman year. I also, um, played in many tournaments and was, was ranked within the Midwest within my age group like, top 60. And I was ranked number one in southeast lower Michigan for my age group a couple of times. 

00:06:55
Tighe Keating Certified Tennis Pro 

00:07:00
TIGHE KEATING It was when he was knocking off players that were really hotshots in not only the local area but state level and also, uh, five-state level. And he was able, it wasn't intimidating to him. I mean, he was, he knew that they were good players, but, um, he had practiced at a level where he could compete with them and break them down and wear them out and find their strokes' weaknesses and pick on them. So he was a giant killer. Because these kids are typically far bigger than he was, much faster and much stronger, and somehow he was able to adjust his game and beat these players and walk off the court and you'd think, uh, you know, the assumption would be the seated player was winning, but he walks off and says, "I won. When's my next match?" 

00:07:35
Employment as a Tennis Instructor 

00:07:40
NICK DUBIN I was lucky in the fact that a lot of kids have to go out and search for jobs when they're in high school. For me it kind of came to me in that one of the people who I used to take tennis lessons from needed some kids to work, uh, for him over the summer to teach tennis lessons. So he called me and expressed an interest in me working for him at Orchard Lake Country Club. And my instructor was Jim Fleming, and I, uh, had taken private tennis lessons from him for a couple of years. So he, um, asked me to come and work for him over the summer. 

00:08:10
Jim Fleming Tennis Pro 

00:08:10
JIM FLEMING I met Nick, actually he was a student at Beverley Hills, uh, Athletic Club, and I was a tennis pro there, and he was a student, and, um, just got to know him through the program, you know, as he was in high school. And, um, as we're looking for staff members for the summer, we're always looking at the kids coming out of the programs that we're in to maybe come and work for us, and I saw as a Nick a kid, I saw Nick as a kid who loved tennis and loved kinda being around, uh, the people when they was in, when he was out on the tennis court. And so we hired him to come work for us. 

00:08:50
NICK DUBIN Well, here we are at Orchard Lake Country Club. In the background you can see a beautiful clubhouse, clay tennis courts, beautiful lake in the background. At the time, I felt so fortunate to be able to work at a place like this because here I was working in an area of my special interest, tennis. I was working, uh, in a place where I could make a good amount of money compared to other kids my age. And I thought I was just the luckiest person to be able to land a job like this. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, every day I would come home completely drained, have no energy whatsoever, and I felt like there was something wrong with me because I didn't know what was causing this enormous energy drain. 

00:09:25
Larry Dubin Nick's Dad 

00:09:25
LARRY DUBIN As Nick's father, I was always confused when he would come from his tennis jobs over the years. I knew he was a terrific tennis player, he won matches, was all-state, uh, working in these beautiful environments of country clubs, and he'd come home and he'd be unhappy, he would be drained, he'd have no energy, he didn't wanna do it, uh, but it was, uh, basically the, uh, the thing that he did best, and it created a lot of confusion which I never could, uh, understand at all until his diagnosis, uh, of Asperger's, and then things started to, uh, to make sense. 

00:10:05
JIM FLEMING TENNIS PRO 

00:10:05
JIM FLEMING He played very well, and, um, he was a very feisty component, uh, opponent. He was just, you know, always fighting for points and just, uh, very passionate about like, like, um, being as successful as he could be too. He didn't, I remember at times, you know, 'cuz we'd compete, you know, when the work was slow and stuff and we'd play, and I can remember sometimes when he did like losing to me. But he was, uh, you know, he, he was a good tennis player. 

00:10:35
NICK DUBIN It was really weird because at the time, I was a very good tennis player, and yet, when Jim asked me to change a light bulb, I had trouble even screwing that in, and it was kind of like, "Why can't you do this? You know, you're in college, you're a smart person." You know, when he asked me to, uh, sweep the courts or do the lines where the dirt would come off the line, I had trouble keeping it on a straight line, and Jim would, uh, try to show me how to do it, but I never could seem to figure it out. So little tasks, a lot of tasks involving motor, uh, would give me a lot of difficulty, and I, it was all mystery to me at the time. 

00:11:10
JIM FLEMING TENNIS PRO 

00:11:10
JIM FLEMING A few of the things I noticed like on the, we had clay courts at the club, so with clay courts you'd always sweep the courts and then you'd have to use a, a roller the width of just one of these lines of the courts to brush off the dirt off the, the lines and, and like, many times Nick would, the, the roller just couldn't stay straight, and it would veer off. And we'd talk about it, I'd see him the next morning, and we'd talk about it. He said, "Oh, Jim, I'm sorry, I missed that." And then, you know, it was just something like, it didn't matter how many times I talked about it, there was always like, a line missing or he'd miss an area of the court. Um, and I can remember some instances where we shared some laughs about, uh, about vacuuming 'cuz like, the vacuuming, it was, you know, it never really looked like the vacuum actually was run, but, you know, Nick swore on his life that he ran it. And, and we'd joke about it. 

00:12:05
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:12:05
GAIL HAWKINS Some people with Asperger's Syndrome, um, can be a little, well, as they put it, clumsy, and so it, uh, really, they're talking about their fine motor skills and sometimes their gross motor skills. So when Nick is talking about, you know, not being able to vacuum the room, uh, or it didn't look vacuumed when he was finished or, or being able to do the straight lines, um, that could relate to that. 

00:12:30
JIM FLEMING TENNIS PRO 

00:12:30
JIM FLEMING Um, we had conversations where, um, when you're feeding a ball to a student, you wanna be close to the basket because you have 300 balls there and you wanna be close so that you can just keep feeding these balls. And Nick loved to like, take two balls and walk closer to the kid and then have to go back to retrieve the, and it was this, and I would tell him, "Nick, you're, look at all this time you're wasting. The kid could be hitting more balls." But it wasn't something that I could really get through to him, and I tried a lot of different ways to approach him on it and it was just one of those things where it just kept coming up. 

00:13:00
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:13:00
GAIL HAWKINS This is why we put job coaches in with an individual when they start a job because an employer, we can't expect an employer to necessarily just understand sort of some of the idiosyncrasies that come along with having Asperger's Syndrome. So, um, being able to talk, speak in the language that someone with Asperger's Syndrome would understand, dividing the steps up, demonstrating how it's done. Sometimes it's, um, just getting step one started, and then they're off and running. 

00:13:30
JIM FLEMING TENNIS PRO 

00:13:30
JIM FLEMING I, I take pride in, I think, our staffs were pretty close, but I would certainly say that Nick was on the outer edge of all that. And, um, and it, uh, you could sense like, there was a piece of him that wanted to be part of it, but there was also a piece that maybe he didn't wanna be part of that scene, and, um, and he resisted it. But there was, you know, I don't know if it's the, uh, I don't know if the word I'm looking for, it's not like he was the, like he was an outcast or anything, but he just wasn't in the, in the mix with everybody else. 

00:14:05
NICK DUBIN Socializing with the staff and members was really difficult for me. They would, um, go to play golf every Monday. I didn't play golf, so that was something that I couldn't do. They went out and, and, uh, had fun after work which was something I was not interested in. I was so tired at the end of work that I didn't have enough energy to go with them. Um, one day we went to Greektown in a limousine with our club and another club and I totally didn't enjoy the experience. Um, everyone else did but for me it was really overwhelming and a lot of loud noise. 

00:14:35
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:14:35
GAIL HAWKINS People with Asperger's Syndrome are unique. And you'll hear many different experiences of how they experience social situations. Um, I think Nick's, uh, recollection, his story about going out in the limousine is not unique in the respect that a lot of people with Asperger's Syndrome don't enjoy that. It is overwhelming. It's a lot of stimulation. Um, it's sort of like going to a party where you don't know anybody and trying to fit in, and let's even compound that by saying you're at a party where you don't know anyone and they speak a different language that you've never heard before. It'd be pretty hard to fit in, and it's really stressful. And I bet anybody would wanna go home and just go to bed 'cuz that would be a lot more interesting than, than that stressful situation. On the other end, you'll get people who love to be, like, crave to be in that social situation. They also have Asperger's Syndrome, except the difference is that they go and they love to be there and love to be in the environment, but still don't know how to relate. And so, uh, I think they, they feel troubled inside because they want to so badly and they can't. They just don't know how to do it. 

00:15:50
NICK DUBIN Well, Scot Acre's somebody who I had known for a long time. I met him my freshman year of college when I was taking a tennis lesson and he hit in with me. So we became friends that way. And, um, I had worked under him at my old high school where I went, uh, as the junior varsity tennis coach for a season. So in 2004, he asked me to come and help teach tennis over the summer which was actually the last tennis job I ever had. It was the end of my eight- or nine-year experience teaching tennis. 

00:16:15
Scot Acre Tennis Pro 

00:16:15
SCOT ACRE Nick worked with me at Elkhearst Golf and Country Club, and it's a newer country club, and I pretty much started the tennis program from scratch. Um, and he helped me in every capacity whether it be with 4-year-olds which was not his favorite thing to do, I might add, but, uh, anything up to the junior tennis team, helping on a daily basis with that, to when I needed to be in other places he would run, whether it would be an adult clinic or a group lesson with beginner-level tennis players. He was, he was in essence my right arm that was working for me when I wasn't around. 

00:16:50
NICK DUBIN And even after eight or nine years, I was still uncomfortable out there. I still had trouble relating to members. I alwas-, I always felt awkward. Um, you would think it would've gotten easier over the years with the experience that I had behind me, but it didn't. 

00:17:05
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:17:05
GAIL HAWKINS With the anxiety comes, uh, some inappropriate comments where you might do something that makes you stand out, um, a little bit. 

00:17:15
NICK DUBIN There was one instance I can remember where, um, one of the swim, uh, lifeguards, I believe, asked Scot, "Gee, is he, is he, is there something wrong with him? Does he have, uh, special needs or challenges?" And Scot shared that with me, not openly, I think I had to pry it out of him, but it just showed that my social uneasiness, uh, was apparent in that situation. Most of the times it isn't because it's an "invisible" quote unquote difference. But in that situation, it's a country club, you're having to hobnob with members, I guess it was a little bit more apparent to him than it otherwise would be to most people under different circumstances. 

00:17:50
INTERNSHIP AT A RADIO STATION 

00:17:55
NICK DUBIN Uh, about ten years ago, I was a contestant on The Price Is Right, and I won $5,000. Uh, so eventually what I did with that money is I took that money and I built a massive jazz and blues collection, mostly jazz, because I wanted to have a radio show at Oakland University. And they told me that I needed a "non-commercial" kind of music which meant music that you normally wouldn't hear on FM radio top-40. More, uh, National Public Radio type music. So I picked jazz because I had some familiarity with it, but not a lot. So I started buying CDs and I was really, really, really getting into it, and all of a sudden, I have a collection of close to, you know, couple thousand CDs. And, um, which gave me a huge knowledge of jazz. Well, this is the student radio station at Oakland University, WXOU, where I spent two years developing my jazz and blues show. And I got a lot of experience in getting on-air time and also learning a lot about jazz and developing my interest in music which, uh, become a lifelong interest for me. 

00:19:00
JIM DULZO JAZZ SHOW HOST ON WDET-FM DETROIT MICHIGAN 

00:19:00
JIM DULZO My name is Jim Dulzo, and, uh, back at that point in time, I was doing a number of things. I was a freelance writer writing about both environmental issues and, uh, music, particularly jazz and blues, and I was also doing a radio program on WDET on Saturday nights, a rhythm and blues show. 

00:19:20
NICK DUBIN So I contacted this guy, Jim Dulzo, who had a jazz and blues show on Saturday nights on WDET. 

00:19:25
JIM DULZO JAZZ SHOW HOST ON WDET-FM DETROIT MICHIGAN 

00:19:25
JIM DULZO Nick struck me as kind and as quiet, uh, kinda shy, but at the same time, willing to reach out to and get involved with a total stranger just because, uh, we shared a real strong mutual interest in something. And, uh, I thought he was funny in a very low-key kinda way. And, uh, I really liked him. 

00:19:50
GAIL HAWKINS This is what I love about people who I work with. It's like, you know, uh, they get discovered or they discover their, their, one of their passions on The Price Is Right, you know? I mean, how great is that? And spend their winnings on, uh, buying the CDs. And then the passion grows from that. And usually when someone with Asperger's Syndrome has a passion, it's big. It's big and they know everything about it, they learn everything about it, they eat it, drink it, sleep it. That becomes their focus. 

00:20:20
Conference on Asperger's & Employment Speakers Included Nick Dubin & Gail Hawkins 

00:20:20
NICK DUBIN But to really look at how a person with Asperger's functions in the workplace, we really need to look at the basic profile of somebody with Asperger's. Now, I know from myself, uh, I have tremendous tunnel vision. Um, in other words, there could be things going on that are out of my peripheral vision 'cuz I'm so focused on what I'm doing, and I know that that's a pretty common trait in Asperger's. Um, another asset is incredible knowledge about one or more subject areas. You know, if somebody has knowledge about rocks and they're 4 or 5 years old, don't discourage that. You know, don't discourage anything that you may, you may perceive as weird because they may end up using that for their career later on in life. 

00:21:05
GAIL HAWKINS The other thing I find so incredibly wonderful, uh, about the clients and the people that I work with is that when they have that passion, they tend to think about it or see it or process it in a little bit of a different way, and when that happens, sometimes greatness comes from that. 

00:21:25
JIM DULZO JAZZ SHOW HOST ON WDET-FM DETROIT MICHIGAN 

00:21:25
JIM DULZO Unlike some people that come and, uh, visit me when I was doing the show there, and I always enjoyed having company. It was a lot of fun and good company helped keep me loose and stuff. Um, uh, he really understood who the artists were and all that. He had a real interest in, in, in the music per say and also in radio. 

00:21:45
NICK DUBIN I didn't wanna go into radio 'cuz I thought it was gonna be too social of a career, and I thought it would be, uh, too demanding and too, um, challenging in terms of moving up the ranks. After I graduated from Oakland, I knew that I needed, uh, some more education under my belt because I wasn't ready to enter the workplace so I decided to look around for different, uh, careers and, and different degrees that I could pursue. And I ended up pursuing a master's in, uh, special education because I had a documented learning disability and I thought this is my way of sort of giving back. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
Pursuit of Elementary School Teaching Career 

00:22:25
GAIL HAWKINS I'd be really honest with Nick and I'd say, uh, that I have some reservations about this and I would say, "Why?" I would say, "Why?" I would talk about, uh, the kids in that, in, in elementary school will have behavioral issues or they'll be running around and they're rambunctious, doing this, that, and the other. Um, they also, uh, as, as Nick knows and can talk about, can be cruel, and they don't really decipher, you know, who they're gonna be cruel to. Well, it could be a, you know, a kid or it could be an adult and, and that can turn from, that dial can turn in any direction, especially at that age and group, you know, strength in numbers. So there's a lot of different factors and it really means multitasking. 

00:23:15
NICK DUBIN After I completed my studies at the University of Detroit, doing reasonably well, getting a 3.7, and graduating magna cum laude, uh, I had to complete a student teaching requirement, and this is where I was assigned, Norman Barnard Elementary School in Troy, Michigan. And, uh, the experience was a disaster, but I, I've learned a lot since then. And the principal I was assigned to, Chuck Hettenbach, uh, interviewed me and thought that I communicated extremely well with him, so he had every reason to believe that I would do well in the classroom. 

00:23:45
CHUCK HETTENBACH PRINCIPAL, BARNARD ELEMENTARY TROY PUBLIC SCHOOL, MICHIGAN 

00:23:45
CHUCK HETTENBACH Nick, uh, was working with, uh, Karen Bush who was his cooperating teacher. And, uh, uh, Karen had a group of 2nd graders. There were about 24 students in the class, and, uh, it was a very diverse group of students from literally all over the world. 

00:24:05
NICK DUBIN Julieann Gerds was the, uh, teacher that I was going to do my second semester student teaching with in the learning disabilities room, and, um, I had talked to her about my difficulties with fine motor because that was a documented disability at the time, and she could tell that I really needed to learn how to write and do printing and cursive 'cuz you teach 2nd graders handwriting, and I didn't have that skill. So over the summer, I would go to her house about once a week and she would help me learn, or relearn, I should say, how to print and do cursive. 

00:24:35
Julieann Gerds Special Ed. Teacher, Barnard Elementary School Troy, Michigan 

00:24:35
JULIEANN GERDS And he shared with me that he himself had been in a learning disabilities classroom, and, um, that he had, you know, a terrible time with fine motor tasks. And, um, and then went on to find out that he's a great tennis player, you know, so there was, that, to me, was a discrepancy. And, um, you know, and so then I invited him to come to my home during the summer where I was gonna be teaching, uh, and tutoring, and I would help him with his fine motor 'cuz I told him that being in the classroom, he was going to need to write on the board and he was going to need to be able to do fine motor tasks. So he came, and I gave him a lot of credit. 

00:25:10
NICK DUBIN I pretty much knew on day one that student teaching was not necessarily gonna be something I was gonna thrive in. I didn't necessarily know at that time I was gonna end up quitting after a month, but I knew that I walk into a room where there were 30 kids who all had totally unpredictable needs and, um, it just played into so many weaknesses. Fine-motor-wise, I had to cut and paste and hang things from the ceiling. 

00:25:35
Julieann Gerds Special Ed. Teacher, Barnard Elementary School Troy, Michigan 

00:25:35
JULIEANN GERDS Right off the bat, Nick struggled with this. He struggled with retaining, he struggled with getting into the groove, he struggled with all the different things that you need to remember at the end of the school year. And so Mrs. Bush would come and consult with me and ask me, you know, well, this is what happened today, and I would, my feeling was when she was telling me he struggled with the different schedule changes and remembering what she deemed were simple tasks, you know, to get the children down to the gym on time and to walk them all the way down there. 

00:26:05
CHUCK HETTENBACH PRINCIPAL, BARNARD ELEMENTARY TROY PUBLIC SCHOOL, MICHIGAN 

00:26:05
CHUCK HETTENBACH Uh, research tells us that a classroom teacher makes about 12,000 decisions a day, and, uh, the direction that the lesson and the whole classroom takes is dependent upon, uh, those decisions that you make.

JULIEANN GERDS And then more alerting behaviors became more apparent that Nick struggled with multitasking within that 2nd grade classroom. Um, and, and anyone who's been in a 2nd grade classroom knows there's many things going on at once. Um, Nick struggled with, with, the phone would ring, you might have a child underneath the desk acting up, and other children chatting, all that different stimulation happening. He couldn't, he didn't know where to act first. 

00:26:55
NICK DUBIN And so there were 50 demands at once, and I could only concentrate on one at a time, and it was really, really difficult. And because of that, I think both of these people, the, the learning disabilities teacher, Julieann Gerds, and the teacher who I worked under, uh, Mrs. Bush, felt that I wasn't trying. But that clearly wasn't the case. I was very motivated to do my best, but I, it just, whatever I was doing, it wasn't cutting it. 

00:27:15
CHUCK HETTENBACH PRINCIPAL, BARNARD ELEMENTARY TROY PUBLIC SCHOOL, MICHIGAN 

00:27:15
CHUCK HETTENBACH Well, one concern that was expressed to me was that he didn't seem to want to go beyond the classroom in making contacts with the kids. Like at lunchtime or recess time or before or after school kind of thing where he tended to go off, uh, by himself and, uh, do things, uh, rather than interacting on a, on a more personal basis with the students. 

00:27:40
Julieann Gerds Special Ed. Teacher, Barnard Elementary School Troy, Michigan 

00:27:40
JULIEANN GERDS When the two of us were conferring, what you would have heard was, you know, we've asked him several times to, um, not present the lesson that way and to go about it this way, and we've told him several times that when a child does this, you need to quickly do this. Um, we've told him not to talk about personal things or whatever, you know, in front of the students. Um, and he doesn't, he's not listening. He's just not listening. Is it because he just doesn't, is he giving up? And that's one thing that I really felt strongly about, that Nick wasn't, just wasn't trying. 

00:28:20
CHUCK HETTENBACH PRINCIPAL, BARNARD ELEMENTARY TROY PUBLIC SCHOOL, MICHIGAN 

00:28:20
CHUCK HETTENBACH Well, we were talking about a lot of the different kinds of things that Nick was struggling with. And, um, some of them seemed to be things that he just wasn't going to overcome. And, um, um, the frustration of it all seemed to be getting to him. And it, it almost seemed like it was having a snowball effect, that the more, uh, he struggled with things, um, uh, the more frustrating it got, uh, the more he was incapable of doing some of the things. It was almost like a, it put up a block that he couldn't get beyond. 

00:29:05
Julieann Gerds Special Ed. Teacher, Barnard Elementary School Troy, Michigan 

00:29:05
JULIEANN GERDS We didn't have all the pieces to the puzzle, but you never do, and that's why they say hindsight is 20/20. You know, looking back, wow, it was perfectly clear why things were going the way they were going. 

00:29:20
NICK DUBIN Julieann pulled me aside beside because Karen had been coming, Karen, Mrs. Bush, had been coming up to her saying that I had been causing all sorts of problems in the classroom. So one day she pulled me aside and she basically said, you know, "What you're doing isn't cutting it. This kind of effort wouldn't survive in any work setting. Um, I don't care what you do," and I, I really felt cut down and shot down to pieces because I really was trying, but I felt like no matter what I did, it wasn't good enough. And at that moment, is the moment where I knew I needed to quit. 

00:29:50
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:29:50
GAIL HAWKINS It is a common experience. You hear it often. "Oh, he's just lazy." You know, um, you know, "He, he just needs to apply himself. He's just lazy." Or, you know, "She, you know, she just needs to work a little harder." That's not what's happening, but it can be perceived that way and is often perceived that way. 

00:30:10
Julieann Gerds Special Ed. Teacher, Barnard Elementary School Troy, Michigan 

00:30:10
JULIEANN GERDS Nick, the experience with Nick impacted me in such a way that just because a person presents themselves a certain way doesn't mean that that's the way it is. And so what I have, what I have learned from this experience is to try very hard to, myself, not act impulsively on information I've learned, but to sit back and to assess it. 

00:30:35
NICK DUBIN Well, after I quit my, uh student teaching job, I was really devastated. I didn't leave my apartment for days, I thought that was going to have to be having to stuff envelopes as a career. 

00:30:45
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:30:45
GAIL HAWKINS I think it's maybe the obsessive-compulsive component. When something really, um, bad happens, they have a very hard time, um, harder than usual, getting off that sort of, that, that negative broken record that goes on and on and on. And, um, I certainly have worked with people who, who had a negative experience even in grade school, elementary school and, um, where that has impacted employment 20 years later because they don't believe they can do it. And, um, we spend a lot of time working on self-esteem and trying to people, bring people back and build up their, uh, their, their esteem and, and getting them to have a positive experience. 

00:31:30
Becoming an Expert in Asperger's Syndrome 

00:31:35
NICK DUBIN A few months after that, I was looking at various programs 'cuz I thought maybe I would get another master's degree in something. And I came across a program called the Center for Humanistic Studies. As I mentioned earlier, they offer a doctoral program in psychology, and I thought, "Okay, I have an interest in psychology. I'll check it out." And I did, and I, uh, went on a whim for an interview, kind of debating the night before whether I should or not. And, um, they accepted me because my master's was in, uh, a related field, education. Here at the Center for Humanistic Studies where I've, uh, been pursuing my doctoral degree for the past year and a half I have just had a phenomenal experience. I've made some connections which is really a first for me. I've been studying psychology and Asperger's and autism and learning a whole bunch about myself, and it's truly been a wonderful experience and I can't wait for it to continue for the next two and a half years. If you would have asked me five years ago, uh, what I would be doing, the last thing I would say was working in the field of autism-spectrum disorders. But as it turns out, this is kind of where I've been led and as a result of that, I've tried to learn everything I can about ASD, and I've tried to kind of become an expert in this area and I hope to do that, I hope to continue that career. 

00:32:50
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:32:50
GAIL HAWKINS I think that Nick has made a smart choice. I think, uh, I admire that he's tried many things and this has sort of been a, a journey that he's been on, and he's tried different things that have kind of led him. And if you look at sort of his path, he's kind of taken some of the good things out of there and eliminated the bad which is what we should be doing. And for him to go into this area where he has, um, a truly personal vested interest and he has the compassion, he has the big heart, and he seems to really want to, um, do this to help other people so that maybe they don't have the same experience or so that they can maybe get over that, those negative experiences a little more quickly. I think it's brilliant. He has a unique insight, and, um, he can bring that to the table and he can really help other people to understand. People with Asperger's Syndrome and many people without it need to hear about what Nick has to say, need to hear about his story. And, um, I think he, he really adds value to the community, to the Asperger community and to the community at large. 

00:34:00
NICK DUBIN Well, here at the Judson Center, I've been fortunate enough to give, uh, speeches to the community about Asperger's Syndrome and bullying prevention, uh, through Stephanie Harlan who's the director of Autism Connections here at the Judson Center. And I've had a tremendous experience giving these speeches. I think it really utilizes my strengths and communication and speaking, and it was, uh, something I was not able to do before I got my Asperger diagnosis. The diagnosis really set me on a path of, uh, a career path for really what I'm doing today. So I'm very fortunate to be affiliated with this, uh, organization. 

00:34:35
Stephanie Harlan Judson Center Autism Connections Royal Oak, Michigan 

00:34:35
STEPHANIE HARLAN Oh, Nick is an excellent presenter. Um, a lot of people are surprised because they underestimate the ability of an individual with Asperger's, and they don't have any idea how articulate Nick really is. But when he speaks, he speaks not only based with, uh, with a lot of facts and figures about the research that he's done, but he brings a lot of the personal anecdotes and the warmth and, and the stories of his own life, um, that just make the presentation just seem so real to people, and he has a way of connecting with the audience, um, that's phenomenal. He's able to inject humor and a lot of personal stories and he really hits home. 

00:35:15
NICK DUBIN Now that I'm engaging in all these new activities like writing and speaking, it really feels great to be able to finally be doing something that seems aligned with, uh, who I am and, and some true interests. And I'm excelling at these things, whereas with the teaching tennis, I got through it, I never got fired, but I was not excelling or even enjoying the experience. 

00:35:35
Stephanie Harlan Judson Center Autism Connections Royal Oak, Michigan 

00:35:35
STEPHANIE HARLAN Um, Nick obviously has a passion for the subject and a passion for helping people, and he loves, it, it certainly appears that he loves what he's doing. Um, the only, with it, so just a minute amount of additional support, um, people with Asperger's are able to do whatever they wanna do as long as they love what they're doing. 

00:35:55
NICK DUBIN Well, this is Pawley Hall at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. This is where I'm currently doing my internship for my doctoral studies. And it's really a pleasure to come every Monday and Tuesday and work with, uh, Dr. Graetz who's such a great mentor. And I'm learning a whole lot every single time, and the research and the projects we're doing are fascinating, and I'm, I'm really enjoying it. 

00:36:15
Dr. Janet Graetz Professor, Oakland University Rochester, Michigan 

00:36:20
DR. JANET GRAETZ With his background and now with his knowledge about his own disability, he, he brings a wealth of information to me and to everything that we're working on, uh, here at the university. And so he can give me that authentic piece about what it feels like and, you know, certainly I can read about it, but Nick really lets me know what it's, what it's like to have, to be an individual with Asperger's. And I think that's one thing that's very valuable when he relates with some of the other individuals that are coming to campus in that he's really got that rapport with them because he knows exactly where they're coming from. 

00:36:55
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:36:55
GAIL HAWKINS If you look at the general, uh, workforce, a lot of the complaints I hear from employers, oh, you know, they're, they're, you know, they're chitchatting and they're gossiping and all the things that happen at the water cooler, tend not to happen so much with someone with Asperger's Syndrome. They're focused, they wanna get the job done. So that's a big checkmark. That's a wonderful thing, dedication, devotion. Um, if they agree that they're gonna do something, they usually stick to it. So that reliability means a lot when you're an employer. You want somebody you can count on. You want somebody who, uh, you can trust. And honest tends to be, again, I'm making these very sweeping statements, but, uh, I've found them to be mostly true. Um, if you want somebody to open or close for you and to have key-holding responsibilities, um, that key won't get lost. You know, that person's gonna be taking that very seriously. Um, attention to detail. Um, that is another, uh, excellent trait, um, depending on the job. If you have, uh, a copyeditor, that's important. If you have somebody who's doing, um, taxes, that is important. Those att-, those points, those attention to details, that, that can be really excellent. Um, I can probably go on and on about the positive traits. Um, I think there are more positive than negative. It has to be presented that way. I think you have to be honest when you're talking to employers and be clear about what the challenges are, but you can also offer the strategies and solutions. 

00:38:40
Dr. Janet Graetz Professor, Oakland University Rochester, Michigan 

00:38:40
DR. JANET GRAETZ I think that Nick as a speaker, you know, he's, he's an excellent speaker, and first of all, he's very charismatic and very charming when you meet him. And so when he gets in front of a group of people, he, he does a real good job. And especially because what he's talking about is based on his life and his experiences. 

00:39:00
Larry Dubin Nick's Dad 

00:39:00
LARRY DUBIN Now when I see Nick come back from speaking at a conference or speaking to a teachers' group or seeing his evaluations from graduate school while he's working on his doctorate degree, it is amazing that it's the same person who was having the difficulties, uh, that he was having while he was teaching tennis because now I can see that he's using his strengths, he's helping other people, uh, he feels very good about, uh, the skills that he's able to use and the accomplishments that, uh, that he is having, um, and, and that transformation from where he was to where he is now, uh, is truly remarkable. 

00:39:40
NICK DUBIN Based upon my experience, the advice I would give to people with Asperger's looking for work is to try to focus on what they've been interested in ever since they were kids, what their passions are, and maybe those passions can lead to a potential job. It didn't work that way for me because I haven't been interested in autism since I was 3, 4 years old. Um, it just, that kind of turned out to be a late-developing interest for me, but for other people I would suggest, uh, particularly if you're in high school, focus on what you're interested in and try to develop that passion and learn everything you can about it and hopefully that'll become your career. 

00:40:15
Gail Hawkins Asperger's Employment Expert Hawkins Institute Toronto, Canada 

00:40:15
GAIL HAWKINS Well, I think Nick is, um, a good example for people to follow. He has gone through the challenges that are quite typical for many people with Asperger's Syndrome. So a lot of people with Asperger's Syndrome and their families and teachers, professionals can relate to, um, and learn from his experiences. And it's a success story because what, what he's doing now, what he's working toward, he's getting, uh, the credentials, the, the credibility in his education, his public speaking that really set the stage not just for him, but for other people. And I think that what Nick will find over time is that, uh, he'll become a mentor, whether in person or through video or through his books, that, uh, that over the years 'cuz I'm saying he'll probably write more than one, uh, is my guess, that, um, I find it, I think he'll be a mentor and he'll be a great example for people. So, um, for that, I say congratulations to him.
