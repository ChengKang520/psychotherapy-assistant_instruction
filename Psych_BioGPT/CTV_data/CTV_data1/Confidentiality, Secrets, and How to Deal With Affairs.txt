RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and I'm your host for this networker series Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. Well one of the things about couples therapy that at least makes many of us nervous, many couples therapists nervous, is infidelity, affairs, and for a long time, there was really no discussion up until perhaps the mid 80's of infidelity and that as a therapeutic issue, and what's the therapist's role when an affair is revealed or suspected. And so one of the themes that we knew we wanted to address in this series was this whole question of affairs and what it is that, what's the therapist's role in helping couples who are trying to deal with an infidelity of one kind or another. So today, we have somebody who has a broader cultural reference than many of us do. Our guest today speaks 9 languages. Not only does she speak 9 languages, but she has written a book, called Mating In Captivity, that has been transferred into 25 languages. So it is my great pleasure to welcome our guest today, Esther Perel. Esther, Esther, how are you? 

00:01:30
ESTHER PEREL Hello Rich. Hi. I'm good. 

00:01:35
RICH SIMON Good. So... 

00:01:35
ESTHER PEREL Let's go. 

00:01:35
RICH SIMON All right then, go me. We're having a cross-cultural thump here but we'll get over it pretty quickly. So um, let's start off, so you grew up in Belgium. You came to the United States and started practicing psychotherapy when you were in your 20's. Let's start off, so when you first, as a young therapist, got introduced as a, to the way infidelity was regarded, the way therapists talked about affairs, and the ther-, the notion of what the therapist's role was, can you uh, remember your initial reactions? Was that, did that fit with what your own cultural background was and your knowledge of how the attitudes toward affairs in other cultures? 

00:02:20
ESTHER PEREL I think my original reaction was probably similar to medical students who come from all over the world and get training in the US. You forget your native practices. And you think on the dominant culture in which you are trying to immerse yourself, and you believe what they're telling you, and you just act accordingly. If, and you can have your dinner conversations at night in which you still have your other self, but it isn't the one that comes to work with you in the morning. And I definitely embraced a lot of the ideas that, that were part of the traditional training. When it comes to infidelity, some of those, or even to couples therapy, I would say, I think that maybe couple therapy and then the subject of infidelity, within it is you always see the couples together. Couples therapy is a practice of two. Couples therapy is by definition a desexualized practice because there are no sexual problems because sexual problems are the consequence of relational problems, and therefore if you fix the relationship, the sex will follow. Intimacy is a matter of opening up and transparency and wholesale sharing and truth telling and therefore the revelation of an affair is intrinsic to the rebuilding of the intimacy. Whereas this notion that maybe truth telling and transparency can be highly traumatic, no, no that was not a part of the thinking but by definition lying is about deception. It never can be about protection, because in this culture that is called eating, what is that, the expression, having your cake and eating it too. 

00:04:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:10
ESTHER PEREL It's a version of that, right? 

00:04:15
RICH SIMON Having your madeleine and eating it too, I think is how the French say it. Okay, okay. 

00:04:20
ESTHER PEREL I think that the ideas also, so the ideas of transparency, the ideas that revelation is a cynic one on for the rebuilding of the relationship, the notion that secrets are always bad, the notion that an affair is irreparable damage, that you either go to the lawyer or to the therapist, the idea that there is a victim and a perpetrator in some way, or there an injured party and there is a person who has inured that person, and the field has ample advice for the perpetrator, if you want, to repair, to show remorse, to repent, and ample empathetic stances toward the person who was injured. The notion that a person who was hurt or betrayed has license to ask for as many details as they want until they experience trust, and the notion, of course, that maybe trust is about living what you will never know and that if you need to know all the time, then it may mean that you never trust. That wasn't a thought that was in that training either. And um, that affairs are always a matter of betrayal, of trauma, of lying, of deception, of duplicity, and that there is a kind of a PTSD response to it. And rather than also, not rather, but and including in it that maybe infidelity is also a matter of the complexities of love and desire, that maybe marriages are imperfect arrangements, that maybe not all of us are monogamous, that maybe sometimes truth is not the best way to rebuild closeness, that maybe honesty is not always a matter of confession, as a moral cure but that in some other cultures honesty isn't about the person who reveals but about what it's like for the person who has heard it all to live with the knowledge and that 

00:06:40
RICH SIMON Okay, let's [crosstalk] that's great, so you've laid this out. Okay, so let's, so back, let me pick out of all the interesting things you just said let me just pick, let's start us off on this idea of, the idea that there's another model besides the idea of victim / perpetrator. There's another way of understanding affairs or particular affairs. There are different kinds of affairs or different kinds of relationships and people have different experiences with that. So how, let's start off with this, because I think what happened just in the context of our field, we had no discussion of infidelity until I think towards the latter part of the 1980's, and Frank Pittman and some others began to write about it and bring this topic into, became a conversation, and what seemed to emerge, and this I think this is, my perspective is somewhat like yours or my recollection of that era, was that there was a certain prescribed path that once that a, the therapist should not, needed to, we needed to get it out. We needed to, the secret needed to be revealed. The therapist certainly could not maintain that secret and perhaps couldn't even see a couple if an affair was ongoing, and if a therapist, he or she, was aware of that. Is that, was that your sense of, in that era, that a more or less orthodox therapy, it became, we had no ideology, and then we developed a kind of a, a very, a certain kind of orthodoxy or certain consensus it seemed to me, therapeutic consensus about what an affair was and how, what the therapist's role was. What was you perception of that, that period, does that match what your 

00:08:30
ESTHER PEREL Yes. 

00:08:30
RICH SIMON Pretty much what you're describing 

00:08:35
ESTHER PEREL Yes, and I would add a couple of others. By the way, all these ideas I described before, I am, I practice like that for a long time. I embraced it, I taught, I have teachers, and I read Frank Dickman's book and I read Emily Brown, and I read, then came Janice Spring, who I think we are a lot of us indebted to for her wonderful work on that, and her own evolution in discovering the subject of secrecy and her developing the notion of the open secret policy, which I am going to explain because I do a variation of that, and Michelle Shankman who are all people who work with you. So there's been a real progression, you know, from affairs are always a flaw in the marriage, you know, that what, that in itself is already a very powerful belief. If, you know, if a marriage is good, and people can share everything, then there is no need for a secret. Therefore if there is a secret, it means there was something missing in the marriage. Therefore an affair always points to a problem in the relationship. And maybe sometimes some affairs have very little to do with the relationship, so that was a very powerful belief. The other belief is you tell the couple, if you find out that there is an affair, I cannot see you until you tell your partner, like we would say to someone, I cannot see you if you're actively drinking. We used to have a similar notion. You know, therefore either you stop having the affair, which of course many times people will not do, or they may do externally but certainly not enough internally, or I need to refer you to individual therapy cause I can work with a couple where there is a secret. And it is this secret that is the problem. There is definitely a hierarchy of secrets. If you tell the fact that you have just raided the bank account and gambled it all away, one the therapist doesn't tend to say you either tell your partner or I can't see you as a couple. It's a real, very privileged secret that seems to create a very strong moral dilemma for a lot of therapists in this environment. I was in Mexico last week, and many of us who have gone abroad where women definitely are in a more vulnerable position, you cannot work from a kind of a rigid stance that says no secret in therapy. It's just not okay because the revelation of the secret can sometimes justify violence and killing. So you better understand that this is not a universal, there are some real powerful nuances about the consequences of knowledge, not just laying the knowledge out there. But the notion of I can't see you if there is a secret, the notion of the revelations of all the details matter to the restoration of trust and intimacy, probably outweigh, are two of the foundational thoughts that guided a lot of use in this orthodoxy that you're talking about. 

00:11:45
RICH SIMON So, so let's start with that and sort of build some alternative, give some discussion here of different ways of approaching it. So, we'll, in your own work, and you've, we had an issue last year on talking about affairs and different therapeutic approaches and treatment philosophies, so what's your, in terms of this issue about secrecy and whether the therapist can, should, is there circumstances on which the therapist can, has, shares a secret with one partner in the couple that an affair is going on, tell us about how you work with secrets and what your own attitudes are, what your own practices are in regards to transparency and secrecy and regarding the disclosure of the affair. 

00:12:35
ESTHER PEREL I think for that we need to reintroduce a word that is often missing is privacy. It's a continuum, transparency - privacy - secrecy. What often seems to happen is that we kind of gravitate to the two extremes. So I see a couple and I would say this, this for my practice in general as a couples therapist, then my working with, with couples with, where there is an infidelity enters into that, rather than something that has been tailored specifically for working with affairs, which is probably about 40% of my practice today. I mean people seem to come a lot around the issues, you know, the intersection between couples, sexuality, infidelity and culture. That, so I am going to meet with you both. When I see a couple, that doesn't mean I always see you together. I sometimes will see you separately, at my request or yours, and those sessions will be confidential, which means that there are things you are going to be telling me that you may not necessarily tell your partner yet. I may sometimes suggest that it may be interesting to know what would happen if you were to bring this up to both of you, but it is you who will be the masters of self-determination. What it is that you want to have as shared knowledge between the two of you. I meet you alone because I think sometimes it's better to have you not organized by the presence of the other. I think sometimes you're likely to be less defensive if you're sitting here alone and more likely to sometimes take responsibility for your share of the story. I meet alone because sometimes I think that people need it to be able to articulate certain things to themselves that haven't yet really made clear, and they need that space to first make meaning for themselves. And to myself I'm also thinking, and I meet alone because giving up on the affair or leaving the relationship or staying in the relationship are part of the therapy. That is often the therapy of working with an affair, saying in advance, giving it up so that we can do couples therapy, sometimes the experience of the giving it up or not or what one will give up, it is in itself the therapy. The secrets are intrinsic to the therapy. There, you know, so it's not comfortable for many of us, and there is no, I think the practitioners around the field of infidelity often will map themselves on a continuum between those who think that we can sit with a couple and tell them in advance, there are things that I know about you that maybe you won't know about your partner or your partner won't know about you. And that that doesn't compromise the credibility because it's pretty much agreed upon in the first session. It's what Janice called 

00:15:40
RICH SIMON That's the ground rules that you lay out 

00:15:40
ESTHER PEREL Yes, yes. 

00:15:40
RICH SIMON There you go, in fact that's part of the therapeutic contract that you make 

00:15:45
ESTHER PEREL Yea 

00:15:45
RICH SIMON Okay 

00:15:45
ESTHER PEREL Yes, and, but I don't think only in terms of an affair per se. And I don't always know that the affair may not happen whilst, once the therapy has already started. You don't always get it, you know, I can sit, I actually made a little list here, I can sit with the people in the room where an affair has been revealed, right, and they're coming right on the heels of that. But I can also sit with a couple where I think something is going on, but nobody's asking and nobody's telling. I can sit and say to myself, when is he or she going to finally ask. And I want it to come out but the person and the couple doesn't necessarily. I can be with a person who has a question and I ask them, is it that you want your partner to know that you have a question or is it that you want to know the answer, because it's not always the same. Sometimes you want your partner to know that you're having doubts, but you don't really want them to tell you, because then you have to deal with the consequences of knowing. I can be with a person who's affair is over on the outside for a long time, but internally is still experiencing a certain kind of longing. So there are multiple entrances into this, and I think it's really about being open, flexible, spontaneous and responsive to the couple rather than to an ideology, that often is more 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON So let's, let's take a look at that for a moment. So in terms of you, if you stand back for a moment, and you look at your experience as a therapist, so let's take the situation where it emerges in individual session that someone's having an affair and it's not, it's not common, it's not known, it hasn't been disclosed in the relationship. So as you, you're thinking about that, so you have a secret and according to this one view that we were describing earlier, that wouldn't, some people wouldn't be comfortable in that situation therapeutically. So what's your thinking and what are the different pathways that might emerge with that as a starting point? So let's say that becomes clear in an early session of psychotherapy. Give us a few scenarios in varied different ways in which you might proceed with it or perhaps some of the, you've done this, a lot of this. It's a big part of your practice. Maybe there's certain classic patterns that have begun to emerge in regard to that for you. 

00:18:20
ESTHER PEREL So, um, a number of recent couples I have sensed in advance that the couple came because the woman in these instances. I thought to myself, who has she met recently? What's happened to her? She's had an experience, and the experience can be, you know, a Facebook message from an ex-boyfriend from college and you know, just, but she's reconnected with something, and she's reconnected with something that makes her long for lost parts of herself. But she's not telling me of this. They come, they come because she wants 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON You're telling me this because you're picking up on a, how do you know this? How, what is it, a vibe that you get? Or do you, so you get this, so it's something that's really quite intuitive that, at this stage that you begin to suspect that something's happened often, or at least sometimes, where no one's mentioned anything yet. 

00:19:20
ESTHER PEREL Yes, I say to myself, why now? Why now? 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON Why are they coming? 

00:19:30
ESTHER PEREL When you are, when you are suddenly coming to talk to me about your erotic yearnings, when you're talking to me about the passion you have missed, when you're talking to me about a certain kind of lack of sensuality that you are experiencing in your life, when you're, you know there are certain themes that are evocative, and they don't just emerge because you had chocolate for breakfast. So, so you kind of begin to think, where is this coming from? And then I, sometimes I ask. I may just say, tell me something. What, is there an experience recently that, that brought some of this back to the front for you. Or I wait 

00:20:05
RICH SIMON Now just wait and just clarify this, this is, that's not a question that you would typically ask with the couple together if it's, if you 

00:20:15
ESTHER PEREL No, no 

00:20:15
RICH SIMON have a suspicion that you've, of what the answer might be, that's something that you, that's part of the advantage of having individual sessions, I would assume, okay. 

00:20:20
ESTHER PEREL Because I feel that I need to know. I think that I work better if I know some of the facts, at least a part of the facts. I think that I can help someone in front of me who tells me, and then my next questions are, tell me first of all what happened. What, why did you think this, you were available to that at this point? What do you think this affair means to you? And I think that that is probably where I go the most. It's really, in my work, I try to continuously work what it meant for the person who has the affair, and what it does to the person who's on the receiving end of it. And then often there is a third person, you know the literature 

00:21:15
RICH SIMON I'm just, I'm just, clarify that. 

00:21:15
ESTHER PEREL Third person. 

00:21:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:15
ESTHER PEREL What it meant for me to have an affair and what it did to you that I cheated on you, or that I lied to you, or that I betrayed you or that I violated your trust. 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON What does this mean for you, okay. 

00:21:25
ESTHER PEREL Yea, it's both and what it meant for me and what it did to you. And what it meant for me is very, very important because it is where I'm going to go look at the meanings and the motives for the infidelity. And I think what I've often understood and you know, is that beyond the trauma and beyond the betrayal, there is often the theme of people longing and experiencing yearning and wanting to beat back a feeling of deadness. That's what Kate Frank talks a lot about. That some of the prime motive, when people, when you hear them talking about their experience, they had not felt alive like that in so long. They haven't felt that kind of attention. They haven't felt so vibrant and so vital. They're describing passion or the erotic, but they're describing aliveness. And what they're describing is that something had died inside of them. But it's not always because of the, the partner's fault. Sometimes it's life, sometimes it's the stage of their life. I think that the best way I can say it is that sometimes it isn't another person that we are looking for, but another self. And it's our partner that we are trying to leave, but who we have become. And then the question is, is what happened to you? Why did you become like that? How did you allow this to happen? What happened that you either disconnected from these parts of you or that you never even knew existed? Where are you at this point in your life? I have often noticed that a number of affairs take place on the heels of loss in people's lives, a friend that died too soon, or a parent that dies, or bad news at the doctor, but something that puts mortality in front of you and life is short. And then people say, is this it? If this is my life, is this going to be it for the rest, you know, for the next 20, 30 years? And that sense of life is short, I want to feel alive again, I think is a theme that you will often hear when you listen to what is it that you just found in that experience. And why is it you're finding it there and what makes hard for you to experience at home? And are you even unhappy at home? A lot of people who are adulterers are not unhappy in their marriages. That's, and they don't necessarily want to leave their relationship. In fact, and that's a difficult thought often in our environment, in our therapeutic culture, to accept is that sometimes people have an affair in order to stay in their marriage. You know, that it becomes a stabilizer, you know that to be able to accept the compromises of their lives, and some of them are often very hard compromises, it's not frivolous stuff. So my thought is if people stand the risk of losing their marriage, sometimes their children, their house, their money, their predictable future, what is it that propels them to want to take that risk anyway? 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON It can be so powerful, so 

00:24:40
ESTHER PEREL So 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON Frivolously promising that 

00:24:45
ESTHER PEREL So then you become very humble to sit and just say, tell me what, what is it that is making you willing to risk so, so, so much? When this comes out in the couple session, if it is revealed or if it is discovered, which is you know probably the even larger majority, then always the question is how is it found out? You know, technology's pretty much the main, the main ways that, that people are finding out on the transgressions of their partners, and then you have a different set of questions, but then it depends on what situation the couple comes in. If you are, if they come in in the heat of the crisis, on the heels of the revelation, right in the aftermath of it, the most important thing is to create an environment that is a container, in which I make room for two people who are both experiencing loss, who are both experiencing anxiety for the future, who are both experiencing the loss of the predictable future and the sense of control over their destiny, and not for neither of them the story of their life has gone as they had imagined. And one of them may suddenly be jolted out a complete state of, of unconsciousness because they were, you know, in this complete la-la land. And sometimes the la-la land isn't a good la-la land. You know, sometimes people are deeply suffering while they're having their affairs. That's the irony of it as well because they don't know what they want and where they will go, and what I tell them is, please no decision at this point, whatsoever. You are flooded, the system is completely flooded, you have a maelstrom of contradictory feelings all arriving at the same time, you know. And it goes from, why did you do this to me, to don't leave me, to get the hell out of here, to fuck you, to fuck me, to you know, it's, it's one thing and its opposite all after the other. And you hold it, and you tell them no decision, and I am patient. Sometimes it takes two years for people to figure out what they going to do. It's not our urgency that needs to be responded to, that people need to know what they're going to do. And sometimes you do a whole couples therapy while one person is working through what they're going to do with this other relationship, at the same time as the relationship with their primary partner is actually working on itself and improving itself at times, so sometimes the affair is a complete drain on the energy inside the relationship. Oh you asked me about how you sense. There is many ways you sense. You sense if suddenly somebody has lost 20 pounds, you sense suddenly somebody is constantly irritated at their partner, everything the partner does is getting on their nerves. Why now suddenly is your partner, you're picking at that all the time, because they're angry that their coming home and it's as if their partner is to blame the fact that they're you know, having an affair. Sometimes you pick up on it because the person is having a glow on their face and they are actually suddenly desirous of their partner in ways that they haven't been in years, because they're experiencing a charge and they're bringing that charge home. Some of them take it all away and some of them actually bring something back. It's really not just one thing. 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON Yea, sure. So if there's a sudden change in this, the emotional climate of a relationship, means, that's part of it from standing back from it, that's something, and at least that question presents itself, what is going on? Why is this happening now? What is happening outside this relationship that may be triggering whatever's going on within this relationship? Or not going on in this relationship? 

00:28:40
ESTHER PEREL And what may be going on outside may be that you're best friend is having an affair. It's not always you, that somebody very close to you is suddenly going through something that is amazing which you can at the same time be in awe of, intrigued by, disgusted by, judgmental of, it's a lot of things all at once. And so as the therapist, you can at the same time, be afraid for your own marriage, think about the times you've wanted, think about when it happened to you or your own partner, think about your parents, think about your father and your mother and what they were doing, you know, wish for it, be afraid of it, be judgmental of it, be grossed out by it. We have a multiplicity of experiences at the same time as the couple, and that's a lot of intense emotions to maneuver, which is partly why 

00:29:30
RICH SIMON All these paths not, not taken, these, suddenly life opens up and it's not the predictability that could be comforting, it could be stultifying, but it could be very comforting, so I want to find out more about how you, you've described with this very lively way, what people are bringing in to you at this, this early stage of things. Let me just ask you something cause this, this is what the, let's call it the more traditional view of, of infidelity, the, the issue of children, to make a big difference for you in your stance as a therapist, whether there are children in that, in the family or not, and how is that, how is that a factor that shapes how you think about what's going on with the couple and also what you're role might be. 

00:30:25
ESTHER PEREL I'm going to take permission and answer this with a moment of cultural questioning because my original work on Mating In Captivity started with Clinton. And it wasn't 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON Of all the potential reactions, but okay 

00:30:45
ESTHER PEREL There were many other politicians with major transgressions since but well, remember from a cultural point of view, one of the questions that we had, many foreign therapists in this, is why was America so much more tolerant about divorces, one in three and nobody blinks an eye sometimes, and so entrangetent[ph] about the slightest transgression - once unfaithful, always unfaithful. And the rest of the world, in fact the more traditional world, family oriented societies, have tended to opt the other way around, meaning that you try to preserve the family. You try to not rattle the life of the children. You try to not go for the dissolution of all the family bonds. And you maintain the, you know, the trials and tribulations of the adult relationship on the side as much as possible. Plus, your happiness doesn't just pertain to you. It is intertwined inter-generationally and in the extended family, and therefore the solution to an affair isn't just leave. The second cultural thing that was interesting around that time was if Hillary was really a powerful woman, as she claimed to be, she would leave. That is what a non-oppressed and a non-subjected woman will do. And that too is culturally questioned. Do you know, lots of patients are very disturbed by the fact that they still love the person that just hurt them so much. So they hide it. Lots of patients are disturbed to say that maybe they have had some of the most productive and deep conversations since the revelation of the affair that they hadn't had in years. Lots of people are sometimes reluctant to admit that they may have had more desire since they found out that their partner had been with someone else, like they hadn't had in years after rejecting that person for many, many, many years. It's not always that, but those are pieces of truth that people in this society are often more reluctant to, to admit. So when you ask about the children, I think the most important thing is leave them out of it. When a person who is hurt is going to the kids to say, you want me to tell you what a scumbag your parent is, it's really not okay. When the, you know, when because it's not because you have mistreated the wife or the husband or the partner, in same sex couples no different, that you are therefore lesser of a good parent to your child. But that is a notion that is culturally not so accepted here, the same way that because you lie to your wife, you lie to the nation. You know, that you become, not this is a part of you, but this is the whole of you. You know, that you cannot be loyal because you were not loyal in this one instance. So that's the first thing about the children. Do I think people have a different responsibility to examine the continuation of their relationship when there are children involved versus not, yes but they don't need me to do that. That is exactly sometimes why they are having an affair, because they don't want to lose their children. Can you imagine that paradox? I don't want to lose my kids. I don't want to live the life that I have or the provision that I have, emotionally or sexually or intimately, but I don't want to destroy my family. I am staying for my family. And therefore I also, not as a justification, but my affair is a part of that story now, and I don't want to lose my kids. It's very, you know, you can be critical and judgmental of it or you can really step0 back and just see how people are trying to bring the pieces of their life together sometimes, in ways that can be disturbing to us, but that are really meant for them, you know, it's not they want to be able to cheat and have their kids. It's that they want to be able to stay with their children but there are sometimes major gaps in their relationship, or for themselves in their relationship or for the sense in their relationship because that's the marriage they created. And it's a perfectly good marriage but it's a marriage that does very good on renovating houses, raising children, solving problems, high on collaboration, low on playfulness, complicity, and romance. It's not a bad marriage, it's a very strong marriage but 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Let's look, let's look at it's, answer that, because earlier as you were describing this process that you go through, what's the meaning. So you, you don't assume that you know what the meaning of an affair is beforehand. You don't, you don't assume there's a victim and a perpetrator. All what you laid out very, very clearly and very vividly to start off our conversation. So then it sounded as if what is, what you're doing is you keep posing this question and helping people explore what are you looking for with the affair, what's the meaning one way or the other, of this affair for you? And then if it's revealed also, for the partner. So now is part of the question if the, the couple is not posing the question, what's the meaning of all this and whether we stay together or not for the kids, is that part of your role, to bring that into the conversation? 

00:36:30
ESTHER PEREL Yes. Yes, I think if I was to lay it out in phases, and say okay, this is the couple that I know there has been an infidelity, maybe this is still going on, the affair. Maybe it has ended recently. My first effort is stabilize. Contain, structure, and create an alliance with both people together, and they have, and make clear they have very differentiated experiences. They are feeling two very intense things, but it's not the same thing. And maybe the more hopeful sentence I have often said that I didn't mean in that intent but people have come back to me saying this really helped, is to say that you know, I think a lot people in the west today are going to have maybe two or three marriages or adult relationships. Some of us are going to do it with the same person. And maybe your first marriage is over because people want sometimes to see that because there was an affair, their marriage was a failure. Sometimes no, sometimes depends how they decide, but many of these relations are, they were good, they still are good relationships. Don't make the whole thing one big, you know, failure. And then you, so that's that. Then you say no decision. That's the second thing. And that's very much in line also with Michelle Shankman's work and Janice, so in there, we very fairly aligned a number of us. I'm not alone in this rethinking of the orthodox practices is what I'm saying. And then you, you know, you deal with the need for knowledge, and in that place, I try very early on to introduce a distinction between being a detective and an investigator. You know, the detective is really wanting to know the details and going through the phone bill and going you know line by line and which hotel and how many hours and why you here and why you there and often it will keep one person awake years later while the other one is already sound asleep. And I don't know, there is a moment of knowledge one needs to have. There are a few things people really do need to have a frame for this, but basically they need to know but they need to know a lot of other things and what they need to know is what did this mean for you? And the person who is unfaithful doesn't always know themselves either. It's not like they have it clear. So it becomes a real expiration - what was going on in your life? Life stage, employment, loss of parents, vulnerability, aging, other friends who go with younger people or who have remarried and seem to be on a new track and more alive, conflict, oppression. You know, and you get a sense of, what happened for you there? And what parts of you do you connect to there? And what has made these parts from you disappear and is it something between us? Can you ever imagine bringing this back to us? Were you thinking about our children while this was going on? Were you wondering what it would be like if this happened to our daughter? Did you want me to find out? Did you want me to leave you? When I would find out, were you hoping I would make the decision for you? Were you hoping that I would never find out and you would be able to end it long before? What were you thinking - about me? about our children? about yourself? And sometimes people know and sometimes it takes a while to come up with the answer but talk to me about it because there is a very powerful way of establishing intimacy that reveals the affair differently from, tell me everything that happened, and did you sleep and make love this way or that way. If I come to you, and I am able to tell you the meaning and the motive and the experience and all of that in its global sense, not its detail, sordid details, you and I are creating a new meaning about what this affair is going to be for us in the future if we choose to stay together. So you may have had your affair with somebody else, but the legacy of this affair you and I are drawing together. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON And that's the investigation, that you're talking about. 

00:41:15
ESTHER PEREL Yea 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON So that's a co-investigation. We are investigating together what this means for our relationship, our shared bond with each other. 

00:41:25
ESTHER PEREL Yes, yes. 

00:41:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:25
ESTHER PEREL That's very, and it empowers the person. You're not a victim when you ask those questions. Plus you know, you are a lot, you know, often there is one person who will have stuck it out and the other person who went and transgressed and the person who would have stuck it out is very upset because I would, I wanted it too but I would never have allowed myself. That's one thing. Or you know, I never would have done it and therefore I have a certain superiority on you on that. But the fact that you did it does give that person license to also say, I want something else than what I had settled for. I want something else for what I have accepted. So now we are on an equal ground. If this relationship is going to redefine itself, there are two people here who are able to be creators of something new. That is a cultural thing by the way that is often very important. You know, well, I don't think infidelity hurts any less anywhere on the globe. It is acutely painful, to know that you are not unique, that you are replaceable, that you are not expensible, that something that is sacred or special to the two of you has been taken somewhere else, it's unbearable sometimes, you know. But I think the distinction sometimes is between understanding that it can happen, and still be in acute pain if it has happened to me, rather than the other judgment of the other act itself. Do you understand? It 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON So part of it is to come back to where we started then, as maybe this can come out of that anyway. So what you're saying is there's a difference between something being acutely painful and something being automatically traumatic. So there are certain kinds of understandings about ways of looking at infidelity that can make it much more traumatic for the person who has been cheated on, than it may, you can't take away the pain. The trauma is, from your viewpoint, is not inevitable. 

00:43:45
ESTHER PEREL That's correct. I think it has to do, of course it triggers people's exper-, history of closeness and abandonment and obliteration and who has been there for me and why am I not important enough for someone to actually respect me or not, I mean it taps into a lot. But I think that we cannot, you know, you talked about history, and one of the articles that Michelle wrote on the trauma of the affair, she traced this. You know, it's about 15 years, that people began to talk about the trauma of an affair, and the focus being on what is done to the person that is being cheated upon, and not much of the questioning of the complexities of love and desire and what it means to try to be in a monogamous relationship over 40, 50 years that is at once intimate and loving and sexual and exciting and everything else we want in there today, and it's a cultural frame as well. You know, affairs are embedded within a cultural story, and the same way as in Mexico last week, as in a patriarchal culture that it still is, I was in Chappas working, it's absolutely clear that it's a second, it's a double standard. It's the men who are entitled to have the affair, and it's the women who are happy that it doesn't really matter because as long as he comes home at night to me, and he treats me well and treats the family well, I will tolerate and to the degree that she becomes more economically independent, or as in the Middle East, to the degree where she has a car with which she can leave the house on her own. Okay, that was my experience in Turkey not too long ago, she has, she also will begin to reevaluate what are the compromises that she has to make between the stability of the family and her personal happiness. Our behavior with infidelity is linked with our expectations of long-term love, modern love, and our expectations of individual happiness. And trauma enters in that. If I was truly that important, this would not have happened to me. In France, for example, when a couple comes after the revelation, the focus, and this is a very distinct thing that I learned recently as I'm going to more of those countries in Europe in this instance, the focus is not on the lying and on the lying. The focus is really on, do you love her? Do you love him? Because if you have really fallen in love with this other person, then I have a choice - I let you go or I fight for the relationship, and I'll do all kinds of things to fight for it. What will, what tells me where our relationship may or may not go has to do with the nature of your relationship and your attachment to the third person. 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON You say this is French, is that, what makes this distinctively French, or this is something that you associate with the French? Is it, this is not something you, this isn't a question that you would have to deal with in affairs in Manhattan? That doesn't come up with that frequency? Really? 

00:47:30
ESTHER PEREL I rarely hear one partner asking the other person here, I'm sorry to say, do you love her, do you love him? 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON What do you make of that? What's, what's, why in one culture and not the other? What does that say about us and what does that say about the French? 

00:47:45
ESTHER PEREL Let me put it this way. If you notice, a lot of our clinical literature on infidelity only talks about two people. It never talks about the lover. And yet there's no infidelity without at least a third. The entire literature is diatic. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON That's, that is the math, yea, okay. 

00:48:05
ESTHER PEREL Yea, I think that idea that affairs are plots, not of sex, but of desire. An affair is a story not of sex but of desire. And I need to understand the nature of your desire for this third person, and I need to know if I am going to be able to win you back from that third person or if you have connected elsewhere. That becomes what the couple needs to know to know if they're going to go for couples therapy or not. And how do I find that out? Because I stand in front of a few hundred therapists and I ask, what is the moment at which you know that, where are you organizing the couples therapy? And it's the clinicians abroad who are telling me that. I can't, I don't have enough, you know, popular culture is one thing, but I want to know in your office, therapists in Paris, Brussels, Switzerland, Geneva, New Zealand, you know, what's the galvanizing force? And it isn't about the truth. The truth I want to know is not just where you went. It's a given that an affair is about lying. So what I want to know what's the true nature of your feelings for that person? Are you still invested with that 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON That's a very interesting distinction. I hadn't thought of that before, between the investigation and the investigation of desire. What is your heart's desire, what is this, investigating that versus the detective work of the sexuality of, you did, you had sex with someone, you shared something that's our with somebody else. I need to find out about what that is, so this investigation is... Now let's come back to this in a second, but let me just, because we have about ten minutes left and I want to get to 

00:50:00
ESTHER PEREL And so much to say 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON And so then, let's pull back for a second and as we call this, Who's afraid of couples therapy? We're not talking about couples now, we're talking about therapists. So you're clearly somebody who's quite comfortable with, in a, in a role that certainly some therapists would not, would not be of this more traditional stamp, would not be comfortable with. What, at this stage of the game, when do, do you ever feel uncomfortable? What's a challenge for you, in seeing couples as they go through this? What do you personally feel challenged by? 

00:50:40
ESTHER PEREL Oh god, so many. I had three today. So I can, um, I'm just going to tell them because you know it's a day in the life of a therapist. Tomorrow would have been others, but I have a man who I saw actually alone today, but I see the couple, and she had in infidelity that probably lasted a day or two, or a month or two, or something rather small in comparison with what had evolved between them. What was very, I took notes because I was thinking about tonight, and then when I start to think about will I ever be happy with her, I come back to thinking about this affair that she had, and I keep wanting to know who it was because I keep thinking that it is somebody that I know, and so when we go out, I'm looking, is it this one? is it that one? is it that one? And what is it that is so powerful for you about this, I ask, and what comes up is, I felt humiliated. And then I say, but is it humiliation as part of, you know, here is this woman that I love who wanted somebody else or is it humiliation as, and which it is, it tapped my manhood, that as a man, I can't even keep my wife in check. Now that's a sentence, you know, that definitely, I have to breathe through, that you know, if I was real man, you know, what kind of a man am I that I wasn't able to prevent my wife, you know, from, you know, that I let her go out there, and you know, and meanwhile, he has a prolific life of porn of multiple years and drinking and zoning out in front of her, and he is utterly unwilling to see that it was a context of loneliness and hunger and deprivation that wife was living in and that he is no less monogamous than her, or no more monogamous than her. 

00:53:00
RICH SIMON Take this as the therapist then, so you, you find yourself, and with all your cross-cultural understanding and your ability to not make judgments and so forth, this guy really pulls like, hey buddy, wait a minute. At least that's what I'm hearing at the moment about this. And so where do you go with that? 

00:53:20
ESTHER PEREL So I say to him, and then I'll give you the second example, I say to him, let's say you know, John, I just want to understand something because this is not about making an equivalency and a mind of a moral relativism. This is, how do you mean she is, you know, that I am no more monogamous than her? I said, excuse me, tell me if I hear it correctly but you're telling me that when you feel bad, you turn to other women who, lots of them, and when she felt bad at some point, she turned to another man for which she is feeling so bad about, so guilty about, is willing to take every ounce of responsibility, but he is wedded to the victim. It's like if he sees that he was part not of the affair, but of the relationship that they created together, that created the conditions at least for her, for the affair, he loses his moral superiority. So I said to him, I said, do you see that you turn to other women too, or are you telling me that because you don't touch them for real 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON This is the porn, turning to these images, he's getting off on, okay. 

00:54:35
ESTHER PEREL Yes, yes, I said, but your erection is no less real when you are looking at those women than if you were touching a real woman. Am I correct? You know, I say, am I, can I continue on this line of inquiry or are you about to walk out on me? So he 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON Right, right, that's a tough one. 

00:54:50
ESTHER PEREL You know, so here is also a gender part of me being a woman working with a man is this situation, and I'm not trying to put him on the hot seat here but I mean, you know, monogamy is a continuum. So are transgressions and responsibility, so I tease him and I say you know, am I tough, you know, because he said, we've gone there before. I said, yes we have, and you know, I do think that as long as you remain so wedded to how she did this to you, and not that this, the story starts with that and you can't let go of what she did to you, I'm not sure you're going to be in a position to reclaim your marriage. I don't know, you tell me, and then I sit back and I listen. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON Yea. Okay. 

00:55:45
ESTHER PEREL That's one example of discomfort, and you come back and this is over time 

00:55:50
RICH SIMON And you're using your discomfort in an interesting way therapeutically, and what was the, we just have a little time, but I'd like to hear the other example you're going to give us. 

00:56:00
ESTHER PEREL So the other example is, oh there's so many, but one that came up also today was, and this is an interesting one because um, so the woman was married. Her first husband cheated on her. She meets the second husband, and he rescues her from her disbelief in men, if you want, and her hurts and wounds and just tear of the heart like that, and then she finds out that he's also been going around town. But by the time he arrives, he has already been branded as a sex addict by his therapist and by the therapist of the children, who is encouraging her by the way to stay in the relationship for the next five years till the children are a little older. But what she has created is a situation where they are in separate bedrooms but he is not to have sex for the next five years. And so he's doing penance in her house, supposedly for the good of the children, to maintain the family, while he has been seen as an addict. Therefore we now have a disease model, so if he's sick then she's the doctor cause he's the patient, and she knows right from wrong. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON At least she's the nurse. 

00:57:35
ESTHER PEREL And it doesn't help this man take responsibility. You know, and who decides, you know, what is too much? You know, and at what, it's like where does the, where does the moral authority lie and what is the role of the therapist in deciding that? What do you do when you have another therapist that you haven't met on the other side who functions, operates from that endpoint, you know. So of course, I believe in collaborating with the other therapists. And you ask for permission from the couple to speak with any of the other therapists who are involved when you're working around a situation of infidelity cause you need to know the belief systems, the assumptions from which the other therapists are working. I have assumptions too, I am not right on anything I say, I don't have the truth on this. It's not, I am just, I'm thinking this way today and I think it is helping me so that has been more helpful. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON So and what happens with it, so in this case, do we take further 

00:58:40
ESTHER PEREL I don't want to, I am telling the wife if I can see that this is a definition that will be used for his behavior, is it okay if you think of him this way and I don't? But it's very hard for her to not, because she wants me to ally with that ideology, and at any moment if I say anything that questions her belief about him, it's as if I am legitimizing what he does. And so I explain, you know, I want you to know, it's not when you don't hear me condemning, that it means I'm condoning. Can you hear that? Because if I cannot bring his humanity out, what you are about to create for the next ten years in your house here is going to be untenable. It's a jail. It's a jail in which you are going to be miserable but you can tolerate it because you think you're making the other one even more miserable. You know, and so that is a moment where I have to really say, you know, I can see why other people would call him an addict. I have not found that a helpful concept. If we are trying to do here, which is that this man who gave you back so much faith, has now taken it, you know, robbed it back from you, but I don't know in calling him sick is going to actually give you back your faith. Are you willing with me to explore other ways, to not think that because this man hurts you, you should never be in a relationship again. That would be another meaning or 

01:00:35
RICH SIMON We don't have, this is coming to a theater near us in some type, but you're in process with this case, so what two such fascinating cases. Well, we'll have to check in with you in a few months and see where they go. So we just have a few more moments. Last thing for now, so you 

01:00:55
ESTHER PEREL Can I give you an example of meaning, I just thought of a beautiful example of meaning actually, which I'll tell you in 

01:01:00
RICH SIMON Meaning, what is, I'm missing 

01:01:05
ESTHER PEREL Investigative versus detective. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:01:10
ESTHER PEREL Because this is a very beautiful case, because in this instance the affair has ended. The wife comes to see me first alone, to see if she thinks that I would be a person the husband would be willing to talk to. They have fairly reconciled, but something has remained broken and has never been mended again. And she feels terrible about having been unfaithful, and doesn't really understand it. It goes against her values, as it goes against many adulterer's values. Many people who cheat are monogamous in their beliefs for that matter. But it's been years that she cannot, so okay, now they come together and, and at first I ask him, why do you think this happened? You know, what's your understanding of how this came to be? And he talks about the ectopic pregnancy and he talks about infertility and he talks about the young children and I said, you know, none of that seemed to me would make your wife, who grew up with her mother putting her hands underneath the sheets, you know, over the sheets so that she wouldn't touch herself, go and find somebody else. I think it must have taken something else, because she acted so out of character, and I look at her and she also, she doesn't get it, doesn't get, so it's like this mystique is in front of us, you know. And gradually the story emerges that this man has had a life-threatening illness for many, many, many years with multiple you know, invasive dangerous surgeries and he's in utter denial of his mortality. And because that is what has helped him stay alive is not to think about it and to fight it, he has been an amazingly resilient person. However, he was in the hospital at the same time as she was pregnant, and had young children, and when she would go and be afraid and want to talk with him about his potential death and losing him, he wouldn't give her a moment of space about it. And so it was like, if you, if you can't deal with the vulnerability of life, and then you have to go and have an experience where you are utterly not in touch with the vulnerability of life, and infidelity is one of those places. When you are having a powerful affair, you are not de-, like an adolescent who doesn't see danger, you know, and putting that together, it was, it transformed them. It was like for the first time, this thing began to make sense. 

01:03:50
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. So what, and we do need to stop now, but this, what I'm getting from our conversation is, so there's this whole notion about, I mean, underlying so much of therapy, particularly with, when the issue is infidelity, or the apparent issue is infidelity, what is the repair? And so what you're, and what a lovely way to end our conversation, what a telling way to do it, is that what your part, or what you're trying to do, what the repair is, is at the point at which people get what they did, for whatever reason 

01:04:30
ESTHER PEREL that we discover. The repair we discovered was very, very moving but this is one example. This is not a prescription. The man told me early on that what hurt him so much was that there had been another and that what had been so special for him, and he remembered when I talked to him about their early experiences, was when he knew he had given her her first orgasm, and he had been that man that had brought out the woman in her, and there had been something magnificent about that for him. We're talking 47 years back. This is not a young couple, they're in their 60's. 

01:05:15
RICH SIMON Then a memory, okay 

01:05:15
ESTHER PEREL And yes, because you want to go back to the creation myth. You want to go back to that moment when you knew you mattered. You knew that you were something important in that person's life. And in the process of that, we're talking about other aspects of sexuality and maturation and all of that, and I set up a situation in which I asked her to tell him a wish, a sexual wish for that matter, because that was the theme, that's not because it has to be, and it took her two hours to tell something that was that short because it, she had never, it was like literally putting her hands underneath the sheet and taking his hands there with her, in metaphoric terms and inviting him inside that universe of her. And in closing his eyes and in listening to her, I saw this guy who's a cynic, who doesn't believe in therapy, who just is like the whole, you know, gradually he was once again the only person who knew something about her, that she had never shared with someone else. 

01:06:25
RICH SIMON For him that was, that was his repair. All right, well, we do, to end on a dramatic and extremely memorable point, thank you so much. Just you've really pulled together something, I mean I feel like we've moved into this kind of multicultural conversation here about this, both something that's so universal, we have this in I guess most cultures of the world, this whole question of fidelity and affairs and so forth, certainly more in western cultures. At the same time, there's all this variety. There's meanings and ways different couples experience it, and also these cultural meanings. So I want to thank you so much for sharing this with us. 

01:07:15
ESTHER PEREL It's a pleasure. We shall talk again. 

01:07:20
RICH SIMON We shall talk again. And so those of you, if you have found this an interesting conversation, we would invite you to comment on the comment board. This is the, clearly there's all kinds of things at this, the investigation of infidelity and this particular issue in psychotherapy just beginning. Help us, continue with this investigation, so just take a moment now, crystallize your thought, your question, your comment, your response, what you agreed with, what you didn't, put it up on the comment board. Esther has graciously agreed that she will certainly come up in the comment board if she's so moved. She's not going to write another best seller in response to these, the comments, but that she'll be more than happy to look at them and to respond as is appropriate. I very much look forward to where this conversation leads and but for now, for this afternoon, goodbye from Network Central. Take care. 

01:08:25
ESTHER PEREL Thank you Rich.
