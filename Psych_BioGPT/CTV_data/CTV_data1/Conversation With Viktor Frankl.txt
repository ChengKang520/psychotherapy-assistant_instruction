VIKTOR FRANKL We are the values, we, ah, accept in a way, in a certain depth that reaches down to the biologically foundation of the human being. Neurosis is the suffering of a soul that has not found its meaning. Life offers a meaning potentiality, a possibility to invest meaning indeed. Absolutely up to last moment to one's last breath.

00:01:25
NARRATOR Victor E. Frankl was born in Vienna, Austria on March 26, 1905. He received his medical degree from the University of Vienna Medical School in 1930 and his Ph.D. for that institution in 1949. From 1940 to 1942, he headed the Department of Neurology at the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. His promising career was suddenly devastated when he was imprisoned in various Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. Following this imprisonment he returned to a distinguished clinical and academic career including a professorship of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Vienna Medical School and various visiting academic appointments throughout the world. However, through his extraordinary process of coping with concentration camp imprisonment and the loss of loved ones, he began to formulate and approach to the problem meaning in human existence which incorporated into his unique approach to psychological treatment called logotherapy. With encouragement from the late Gordon Allport of Harvard University, he incorporated his remarkable prospective gained through his concentration camp experience in his classic book entitled "Man's Search For Meaning" which was followed by a number of other significant books and publications and the domain of existential psychology. Dr. Frankl's existential view is characterized by a deep humanism and optimism and is surprisingly pragmatic in contrast to the negativism and cynicism, and the abstract nature of many existential theories. It was a great privilege for me to complete this dialogue with Dr. Frankl before a larger the audience at the final plenary session of the rural congress of logotherapy on July 1st, 1984 in San Francisco, California. 

00:03:20
RICHARD EVANS Well Dr. Frankl to begin our discussion, ah, In order to give our students who are viewing this on perspective I thought that it might be interesting to get your reaction to an interesting statement that was made some years ago by Henry Murray of Harvard University who is, some considered to be, the father of American personality psychology. Ah, he made the statement that while the difficulties confronting the individual who wants to study personality is that in some ways all individuals are alike, in some ways some individuals are alike, some other individuals and in some ways each individual is unique. I'm wondering in terms of your own, ah, particular theory how you would review this dilemma of reconciling the three positions. Certainly superficially of course why would-- at the start say you certainly would accept this uniqueness but in addition how would you also look at this problem of ways which all people are alike and ways with some people are like some other individuals? 

00:04:20
VIKTOR FRANKL Each person owns some uniqueness. On the other hand, if you, ah, say each person belongs to the human species not only biological sense but also in the psychological. Nay, even, even more in a no illogically sense you also had. 

00:04:40
RICHARD EVANS I wonder if we can just pause for one, one second, how you'll, ah - 

00:04:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Explain 

00:04:45
RICHARD EVANS - explain, explain exactly what you mean by biological. 

00:04:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Certainly, ah, everybody knows what's the physiological level or somatic level is. Everybody knows what the biological level is, what the psychological level is. I prefer to speak of dimensions rather than levels. I've constructed something I called dimensional ontology and its specific application to the human being is called dimensional anthropology and newer over again psychological refers to that aspect of psychological activity or property in a human being which is not available, which is not accessible to an-- and to other animals to the sub-- sub-human animals but it reserved to the human being in other words constitutive in intrinsic characteristic that is of the humanness of any human being. 

00:05:50
RICHARD EVANS When I did one of these interviews with Ernest Jones one of, ah, Freud's, ah, biographers surely before death, he said, "Well after all, ah, the o-- person's and animal." Very cynical view that this animal can maybe just rise a little above this animal instinct, this animal mode. 

00:06:05
VIKTOR FRANKL Man remains an animal although he is elevated into the next high dimension. It the same as with an airplane. An airplane remains an airplane and certainly airplane even as they long as he solely stop seeing on the ground of the airport. But it certainly will prove to be a true airplane only at the moment when it rise it, when it takes off and that is into the next dimension. This idealism if you wish to call it that way, this idealism I'm standing for is the true realism and, ah, you know who told-- taught me this, ah, most, ah, poignantly? It was my flight instructor in San Diego. He told me that. He told me Dr. Frankl, if you are starting here at this airport and wish to go strictly, ah, strictly east. And you have a side wind from north you will, ah, get ah, th-the result will be a drift toward Southeast. So you have compensate for this drift by doing what we, ah, ah, pilots call crabbing. You have not to, ah, put your cassette, your compass to, ah, east, to 90 but you have to, ah, to set your compass to north of east. So we have to crab, the plane will not go to East but the plane will direct higher than east and only that way he can compensate for the trip. In other words, now the translation from aeronautics into, into, ah, into a human language has been offered by God who once said, "If we take man as he is realistically we make him worst," he will-- they will be a drift toward, toward, ah, the, ah, deterioration but if we take him as he should be seen on the, on a, a pedes-- ah, pedestria-- what do you call it, ah, on a, on a higher level - 

00:08:20
RICHARD EVANS On the pedestal, on the pedestal. 

00:08:20
VIKTOR FRANKL - than he originally is. If we, we if we have-- and has steered for him in the-- that direction you called optimism or people might call idealism then if we take man as he is we make him worst. If we take him as he should be, we help him become what he can be, only then. 

00:08:40
RICHARD EVANS Okay. Now to go a step further into, ah, trying to put the-- put your work in prospective for the student who may not be that familiar with your work. But let me just pick a few concepts out of 40. There we can deal with all of it. Now obviously central the Freud theory is the unconscious, the idea of the unconscious that the individual is more or less, ah, ah, genetically determined in the sense to act out a number of instinctual behaviors that are seeking pleasure that even as a person becomes more in touch of reality, this unconscious continuous to influence the behavior. Now this Freud calls over determinism. There's nothing a person does that's accidental. How do you feel about the counts of the unconscious? 

00:09:30
VIKTOR FRANKL The concept of the unconscious is perfectly-- has remained perfectly valid as I see it. But, ah, the content of the unconscious has been seen too limited by Freud. It was perfectly understandable that, ah, Freud was confronted again and again, day by day with, ah, patients who, ah, really repressed, ah, their, ah, sexuality. Today of course it's different and that is also the reason why, ah, even with the ground of practicability, even the grounds of, ah, utilitarianism in the office, in the clinics, in the hospitals we have to widen, to enlarge the concept of the unconscious because also, not only material that belongs to sec-- the psychological dimension which is the sub-human psychological dimension. Better to say in other words which, ah, ah, is a-- in which also any animal not only the human animal is participating beyond that but we have take heed not to neglect, not to overlook that there are also things that belong to the ontological dimension for instance. Some think a phenomenon so intrinsically human as conscience, moral conscience that is. Moral conscience that cannot be dismissed just as the super ego. As long as the super ego motivates you to do something or to omit a deed it is not yet conscience that has dictated, that has spoken out, that has had its word. But it is still something going on within the psychological rather than the ontological dimension. 

00:11:25
RICHARD EVANS You're really saying that Freud's, ah, conception of the super ego, ah, is perhaps missing out somewhat on a more humanistic component. 

00:11:35
VIKTOR FRANKL As long as you adhere to the basic motivational, ah, concept of Freud's psychoanalysis. You are restricted, your view, your horizon of research is restricted to something that you may as well find in any animal. Former and former times when the traditions for instance, the traditional values as laid down in the 10 commandments we are still universally very valid-- valid. There are words you could follow, yes at that moment you, ah, is it where had the built in command, you should not do that, you should not do this, you should-- on the contrary you should, you should behave that way or another. They are no longer the 10 commandments sufficient, sufficient. He has to sent out to smell out the 10,000 commandments. The 10,000 demands that emerge from each live situation confronting him and to his-- to respond and this means being responsible. Responding to the demands of the hour, of a situation, responding to it. A long the lines of your-- of what your conscience not just your super, super ego demands of you. In the concentration camps they are-- we have opportunities to steal. And I stole, I stole, ah, briquettes of, ah, a coal and so forth to, to heat the, the barracks. So it was even imperative to steal. It was highly meaningful to steal, it was highly meaningful to give false testimony. And there's of, ah, even a case in which I could show that now I forget about this that I don't wish to, ah, ah, to, ah, add the 10, ah, ah, anti-command influence. 

00:13:40
RICHARD EVANS Ah! 

00:13:40
VIKTOR FRANKL Anyway what I want to say is the last, the ultimate question where is, whether something is meaningful or not. God is what promotes the possibility of any other being to act meaningfully to carry out each or his or her meaning. 

00:14:00
RICHARD EVANS I notice in your writing you very rarely refer to Jung, C.G. Jung. And, ah, obviously work very closely with Adler and you had contact with, with, ah, Freud. Did you ever actually Jung? 

00:14:15
VIKTOR FRANKL Meet him? 

00:14:15
RICHARD EVANS Yes. 

00:14:15
VIKTOR FRANKL Not. I wasn't-- I had not the pleasure nor the honor to meet him personally. 

00:14:20
RICHARD EVANS Okay. And you know Jung originally wanna be an archeologist and I believe that he reflects his archeological interest in the way goes further even Freud in talking about phyla genetic, ah, inheritance that can influence the individual namely through the collective unconscious. Now as you know in this collective unconscious he talks about archetypes. Certain prevailing symbols that emerge over and over again like the mother, the father, God so on and so forth. 

00:14:45
VIKTOR FRANKL I would go even farther than Jung did. In the assumption that there is a biological, ah, ah, ah, concession. I would like improvising glee-- to link this with Konrad Lorenz assumption of a biological a priori. I am convinced that throughout the millions of years or, or billions of years of our biological evolution winding up in the, the dimension, let me now say dimension of, ah, the human, ah, ah, species throughout their time. There is a residue better to say a basis on which our-- a lot much of our decisions and the underlying value system is base so that we may say in fact Konrad Lorenz was right when early in the 40th he already came up with that construct of a biological a priori that is if you follow down to the rules of our valuing processes or even of our selection of meanings to fulfill then you may will be justified in this human that there must be a biologically heritage from the billions of years on. A heritage that does not command us to select this way or proceed in another direction but that is identity with ourselves. We are the values, we, ah, accept in a way, in a certain depth that reaches down to the biological foundation of the human being. 

00:16:55
RICHARD EVANS Another one of the interviews we did in the series with, with Professor Lorenz. He is particularly well known to many American readers for his will on aggression. He really takes a very charitable view about aggression at the animal level. He thinks animals rarely aggress into some kind of, ah - 

00:17:10
VIKTOR FRANKL Interspecies. 

00:17:10
RICHARD EVANS - yeah, interspecies, ah, destructive mean but at the human being and peculiarly uses aggression for such things as war destruction and killing. 

00:17:20
VIKTOR FRANKL Let me say on the human level, aggression is nothing primary neither along the psychologistic theories of, ah, the Freudian's nor on the biologistic theories of the, ah, comparative be, ah, behavior theories but on the human level first any individual is capable even more. It is in this capable for any human individual to take a stand toward his own aggressive feelings or drives or instincts or emotions. A human being never is acting out absolutely immediately and totally. Any drives or instincts in a human being, any drive or instinct has first to pass in, ah, through a region, an area where it becomes immediately instantaneously personalized. I allow an aggression mounting myself to come to the fore. I always have to say yes or no. Max Scheler, that philosopher who, like no one else, has influence me, called the human being the, ah, non-sayer. He's capable of saying no or say yes and this holds for aggression and other drives and so, we have to look for what is intrinsically human in so called aggression and this is hate. The relationship between hate and aggression I would say is parallel by the relationship between love and sex. Also in human beings there is no sex without, ah, the human element, the human ingredient, the human-- the personal influence. It has to be personalized if, if only in the fraction of a second but you had always had freedom to say yes or no and the same holds for hate. 

00:20:05
RICHARD EVANS Let's back up a little bit. We talk about a logopsychology. I see you being quite accepting of a num-- number of a basic ideas and constructs from a number different views up to a certain point. In other words you will see if the validity as you said earlier in Freud and Jung and - 

00:20:20
VIKTOR FRANKL And Adler. 

00:20:25
RICHARD EVANS - Alder. And, ah, certainly, ah, ah, you will see some validity in the work of Abraham Maslow up to a certain point whom we knew... 

00:20:30
VIKTOR FRANKL ...but in form the path of behavioristically oriented psychology. 

00:20:35
RICHARD EVANS And then, even, and then even, even Skinner. Now let's talk about Skinner for a moment and try to see if we can put, ah, this sort of a framework for your logopsychology not logotherapy and a little perspective here. Now what has bothered a lot of people is that he's taking a number of principles of shaping responses of human beings that really are very much the same as the principles that maybe used to shape the behavior of animal even pigeons. 

00:21:00
VIKTOR FRANKL But as long or as soon as you conceive of it as something as a basis with a super structure, a basis on which to build the proper building called humanity of humans. Then, you need not be so critically because I-- as I put it at the beginning of our dialogue, you remember I said, "man doesn't cease to be an animal but he's at the same time infinitely more than an animal. In the, in the-- and I invoked the image, the analogy, the simile of an airplane. An airplane doesn't cease to be an airplane although on the ground he may move like an automobile. The same holds for the human being. A human being has learning processes conditioning processes, a human being can-- he fall mentally ill, be reconditioned in a healthy direction and so forth and in this sense, ah, Skinner and all the other behaviorist are absolutely right. But they must not stop or after they have delivered their message, after they have published their books we, you and I need not stop and say that the whole story. But we have to, ah, recognize that in order really and of, of totally to understand the human being we cannot be spared entering the human dimension, the next dimension, ah, to stop into this very three dimensional cube as it where and this becomes particularly important if we are confronted with questions such as is there a freedom, is there a dignity. Skinner did not move beyond freedom and dignity but he stopped before freedom and dignity because he programmatically restricted his view and his research by which here arrived as-- at his-- you to the lower plain which is of course shared with other animals. In so you will understand how come that I once reacted in a question-answer period to a student of Konrad Lorenz. Konrad Lorenz who was, ah, tracing back, ah, the behavior or better to say all types of misbehavior of drivers to certain innate releasing mechanisms and so forth along the lines of Lorenzian teachings. And then I stood up and replied, "You know, of, of, ah, whom you are reminding me? You remind me of a, a rabbi who once was approached by two people from his parish who were involve in a quarrel. The one contended that the other's cat had stole and eaten up two pounds of butter while the owner of the cat said, uhm, that's not only not true, it's surely impossible. My cat doesn't care for butter. Now the-- it was up to the rabbi to pose as, ah, Solomon and to come up within final judgment, ah, in a in terms of justice and he ordered, he want-- "Bring me the cat". He brought him the cat. Then he said, "Bring me scales". He brought him scales. Then he put the cat on one of the scales and ask the one parishioner, ah, "How many pounds of butter, ah, ah, have the cat eaten up?". "Two pounds, rabbi." Then he weighed the cat and believe it or not it was exactly two pounds. Where it, whereupon the rabbi said, "Now I have the butter but where is the cat?" And I told this guy, this Konrad Lorenz guy, I told you it was he. Now why you remind me of the rabbi? You trace back as far as it's possible all human behavior. Now we'll speak of behavior rather than of acting. All human behavior to the level of an animal that is to say to-- you only select those, ah, properties or reactions or phenomena that are equally, ah, ah, visible, perceptible than any animal, any other animal. But small wonder if you then wind up and that I have all that you need to, ah, ah, ah, I was losing the mechanism and what is it called, ah, innate mechanisms, all the behavior types of an animal and so forth but now where is man? The humanness of man has being shut out, has been precluded. So small wonder that he doesn't it, small wonder that as long as you restrict Skinner to this basic square he cannot even see the phenomena, phenomena such as conscience and or freedom or dignity. A, ah, you would gladly accept the hypothesis that conscience is nothing but the result of a conditioning process. Look, just consider a dog that have wet the floor in our, ah, slings under, under the coach with the tail between its legs. This is bad conscience, that was the result of a conditioning process. He's absolutely correct. However, true conscience only begins where the fear of punishment or of against the, the hoping and longing for reward is no longer a determinant and the reason on which you built your decision to behave morally. And so, the man, the onlookers on the street, there will be one of the other who, knowing that he may, ah, he may become the victim of stabbing. Still ventures to intervene and to interfere. But this, ah, ah, members of the minority. You see I believe that decent people are and would ever remain a minority forming a minority in our societies. But isn't this anything but they challenge to each of us to join this very minority. Isn't it a challenge to do our best. Because this-- world isn't about state I'm use to saying but it will become still worse, unless each of us tries to do his own best. Again we may invoke the analogy that was delivered and offered by my flight instructing California. 

00:28:25
RICHARD EVANS As a matter of fact, contemporary Skinnerian Theory has been modified quite a bit and even moving more into a great interest at how can you arrange your contingencies to increase the self-management to making choices that you're talking about? The thing that, uhm, we might introduce at this time, which I think would be very valuable to, ah, many of those watching this tape would be: What perspective you, yourself, have in terms of training young psyc-- psychiatric residence or clinical psychology interns or perhaps others who are going into psychotherapy in terms of, ah, what you would consider to be an important part of their training? For example, ah, would you say it would important for them to learn something about Freud, and Freud in theory, and psychodynamic theory? 

00:29:15
VIKTOR FRANKL It certainly should because I'm pleading for a sound eclecticism. Only on the basis of having, ah, ah, ah, received some knowledge, universal knowledge in the field. So also having, ah, studied, ah, psychoanalysis, ah, individual psychology or (inaudible ) psychology. Also being confronted with, ah, C.G. Jung and others may, ah, even more also with behavioristically oriented psychotherapy, behavior modification methodology and so forth. Only then a student, ah, who is setting out on his career as a professional, ah, counselor or clinical psychologist or psychiatrist has a, uhm, ah, the faculty to discern, and to select, to choose the methodolo-- methodology of choice in a given case and give more the methodolo-- methodology of choice that, ah, e-- that fits into his personality structure. It was Freud himself who once said, "Psychoanalysis is that method that suits my own personality type. But I do no way deny that there might be other doctors who are rather prone to another, to choose, to select another type of therapy." And only the selection of therapy is only a valid act, a justified act. If he knows not only logotherapy, but also other schools of-- with which to compare and then to decide, yes, at least in the, in the given setting confronted with a given case, I select as the method of choice logotherapy. 

00:31:10
RICHARD EVANS There's some eclecticism but of course there also some particularly unique constructs that you used. I think it might be interesting to hear from you specifically what you mean by paradoxical intention and some of the specific strategies that might be used. 

00:31:25
VIKTOR FRANKL I remember that, ah, as early as in 29 I used, ah, paradoxical intention the first time in a certain case when I run the psychotherapeutic outpatient, ah, ew-- an outpatient ward at the universi-- Psychiatric University Clinic of Vienna. And, ah, from then on I practiced it. And in 1939 I first published on it. And in a German book that, so far has not yet meet-- not yet been translated into English, but, ah, solely in other languages I, ah, have coined the term paradoxical intention. And since that time it has been ever more used and applied and is by the behavior therapists, ah, e-- regarded as a, a very e-- efficient, ah, therapy and also practice by them. And, ah, e-- Professor Michael Ascher of, ah, Temple University in Philadelphia, ah, incidentally the follower of the founder of, ah, the behavior therapy Joseph Walther. 

00:32:40
 All right. 

00:32:40
VIKTOR FRANKL Now, the principle is the following, it is applicable mainly in sta-- in phobic conditions and in obssesive-compulsive, ah, neru-- ah, neurosis. But particularly and beyond these, bu-- ah, two categories, in such conditions that are dominated, ah, at the root by what we call in European Psychiatry Anticipatory Anxiety Erwartungsangst . 

00:33:10
RICHARD EVANS Yes. 

00:33:10
VIKTOR FRANKL And recently has been called through the last two, three years refer to in ye-- the, ah, literature in your country in terms of a, a performance anxiety. 

00:33:25
RICHARD EVANS Yes. Yes. 

00:33:25
VIKTOR FRANKL It's really all the same. 

00:33:25
RICHARD EVANS Yes. 

00:33:25
VIKTOR FRANKL So, if someone is afraid for instance, that he cannot fall asleep. And tomorrow he has to, ah, carry out a lot of tasks and people will-- his boss will notice that he's, ah, ah, not attentive enough, ah, enough, or whatsoever. And the more he feels that he will spend a sleepless, sleepless night before tomorrow, the more he becomes excited. The more he's anticipating his failure to fall asleep and, ah, the dangers of a sleepless night. Now, if for a change, you tell the patient, let for a change-- ah, for, a, for a change, ah, wish what you have been afraid all along. Let's wish, tonight I would like to stay awake. I don't give a dam for good -- for where I'm sleeping. And the bus tomorrow may-- I wonder what you call it, ah, ah, I would like to use a, a Viennese term for this, ah, ah, explanation. Evil, evil let's do a, a venture to use you, a slang jargon. Now, my bus may and so forth. You see? At that moment he smiles the same way as you unconsciously was smil-- we-- smiling at that moment. At, at the same moment he did cha-- detaches himself from his pathological condition. And the main thing is he takes the sails out of his anticipatory anxiety, anxiety. It is impossible at the same time to be afraid of something, and to wish for it. Of course he's wishing to remain, ah, sleepless with the, ah, tongue in his cheek. Nevertheless it works. The distance has been put between him, and his symptom of sleeplessness. And, ah, ah, I could enumerate, ah, how many cases-- demonstrable cases, ah, illustrative cases could be o-- offer to you to show really. 

00:35:40
RICHARD EVANS Self-detach was another term to used. So let's back up for a moment, if you don't mind. You were saying the person has the ability to... 

00:35:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Put a distance. 

00:35:50
RICHARD EVANS Put to him, or herself, and view themself - 

00:35:55
VIKTOR FRANKL Objectify it. 

00:35:55
RICHARD EVANS - from the outside there's.... 

00:35:55
VIKTOR FRANKL All right. From the outside. 

00:35:55
RICHARD EVANS All right. 

00:35:55
VIKTOR FRANKL And, one form, one, ah, aspect of safe transcendence is one of the two great human-- intrinsic human phenomena along with, ah, safe, ah, safe transcendence as I recall it, is humor. The sense of humor means that I am putting a distance, and then I have to laugh. I'm not identical with this situation. I'm not even iden-- no longer identical with myself. I couldn't laugh about myself unless I would put me and myself at a distance to it and these of course is healthy. This is-- has a, a healing, ah, ah, ah, ah, a healing force. 

00:36:40
RICHARD EVANS To sort of conclude our discussion Dr. Frankl. There-- a couple of questions I'd like to ask you. What criticisms of your work have bothered you the most? 

00:36:50
VIKTOR FRANKL Only to learn how to put my fo-- how to formulate my ideas in such a way that they cannot be misunderstood in case that they have been misunderstood. 

00:37:00
RICHARD EVANS Which of your contributions both in the standpoint of published works And also from the standpoint of the specific ideas including those works would you, yourself consider to be the most important? 

00:37:15
VIKTOR FRANKL Significant to others... 

00:37:15
RICHARD EVANS To se-- others to the world of human understanding... 

00:37:20
VIKTOR FRANKL Seems to be, ah, the booklet, ah, man search for meaning. Otherwise, it could not, it could not have, ah, sold so many millions of copies. Although with, ah, ah, TV people interviewing me, ask me, ah, "Dr. Frankl, what we think is the seller author of this success?" I tell them, ah, primarily I see in this selling figures rather symptom of the malice of our time. Of the abysmal feeling of a widespread, ah, of widespread feeling of meaninglessness and emptiness and this is a sign of the time here. Ah, but, ah, ah, e-- beyond that, if you ask me earnestly how I could explain this? I must say, perhaps, because that is hap-- at is-- ah, as it happens, Gordon Allport was the one who begged me to enlarge the second part of the book, Basic Tenets of Logotherapy. He insisted that I add the second part which is not contained in, in the German original. The German original is just the autobiographic story of three years spent in concentration camps. But, ah, ah, the-- I wrote the story in 1945 within nine successive days, in one sweep as it were. But how come that people, ah, find so much in that book. I trace this to the fact that thanks to Gordon Allport. The theoretical part is the distillation of the lesson to learn from Auschwitz and the first part is the existential, or experiential validation of the theory derived from the experience. This is the only answer I can give the only attempt in an explanation. 

00:39:20
RICHARD EVANS Well, may I ask you to finally play profit for a moment. I think that the bottom line question in the head of thinking individuals all over the world are asking is, "Can society survive this nuclear age?" 

00:39:35
RICHARD EVANS I would say the nervous system of the Russian scent of the American's is, ah, ultimately one and the same. And I think that mankind has again and again throughout history found a remedy compensating-- preventively compensating for the specific, for the phase specific dangers at the respective per-- historical period of time. This is my hope. What logotherapy can say is only one thing. In the same way as in concentration camps, in all the prison of war camps around the world. Those prisoners have the relatively greatest chances of survival. That is ceteris paribus, under the same circumstances. There was those prisoners who were oriented toward the future. Having the vision of a meaning to fulfill in their future and, or a, ah, another human being to be reunited with in the future. So I think, we may extrapolate this. A rule this long. By saying, if there is any chance for survival of mankind as a whole. It would, would be being reunited, not only people, but peoples. Being re-- ah, united in a common task or in other words, united by a common will to a common meaning.
