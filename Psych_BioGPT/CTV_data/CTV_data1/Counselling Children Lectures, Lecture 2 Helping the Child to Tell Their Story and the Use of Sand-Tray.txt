Dr Kathryn Geldard presents a series of Lectures and Tutorials entitled COUNSELLING CHILDREN produced and directed by David Geldard Lecture 2 Helping the child to tell their story & Use of the sand-tray 

00:00:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Hello, I am Dr. Kathryn Geldard if you listen to my first lecture I hope that you found it interesting and that you enjoyed the tutorial. Before I start today's lecture I would like to reiterate that it is essential for counselors who work with children to be supervised regularly by counselors who are experienced in working with children. Now as I explained in the first lecture, the first step in the counseling process is for the counselor to join with the child so that the child feels comfortable in the counselors presence and is able to talk openly. There are two very useful processes which we can use when counseling children to enable them to get in touch with past events and to talk openly about them. These two processes are projective processes and symbolic processes. In the previous lecture, I explained how we could use miniature animals to help join with the child and also to enable a child to start to talk about themselves and their family. However, I did point out that generally the process are described for using miniature animals is not suitable for children below the age of about 7. This is because the process is a projective process and younger children are not able to use a projective process. However, younger children can usually engage in a symbolic process with ease. 

00:02:20
Projective processes compared with Symbolic processes 

00:02:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD An assumption underlying both projective work and symbolic work is that during the counseling process the child will create circumstances and situations which in some ways parallel or in keeping with their previous experiences, emotions and needs. In a way, the child uses the counseling experience to act out or recreate past events and the emotions and thoughts associated with these events. It is essential to recognize the difference between projective processes and symbolic processes so that they can be used appropriately. First of all let us think about the projective process. 

00:03:20
The Projective Process 

00:03:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The use of miniature animals, is an excellent example of a projective process. When using the miniature animals what the child does is to project ideas about themselves and the family members on to animals that they believe have characteristics that match with their ideas about themselves or their family members. If you took part in the tutorial after the last lecture you will have experienced the projective process. However, let's have a brief look at it again. Imagine that a girl that you are counseling choose a monkey to represent herself. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD And a tortoise to represent her sister. In choosing the monkey, she would have projected ideas about herself on to the monkey, believing that the monkey shared some of her traits or attributes. Similarly in choosing the tortoise, she would have projected ideas about her sister on to the tortoise. She might have chosen the monkey because she saw herself as mischievous and extremely active and believes that monkeys are like this. When initially asked what can you tell me about this monkey, the child might say this monkey likes to have lots of fun. When asked the follow-up question can you tell me more, after thinking the child might say this monkey is always on the go, it doesn't like sitting still and it gets really angry when it's made to sit still. After being asked the third question is there anything more you can tell me, the child might say with a sigh this monkey gets into a lot of trouble. In answering each of these questions the child will be projecting ideas about herself onto the monkey. Similarly having chosen the tortoise to represent her sister, the child might initially be thinking my sister is always doing things slowly and is just like a tortoise. On reflection, she might project other characteristics of her sister on to the tortoise recognizing that her sister is careful and gentle and doesn't do things in a hurry. She might had other people get really annoyed with her because she is so slow. Thus in the miniature animals exercise projection requires the child to have the cognitive ability to project personal traits, characteristics and behaviors from the member of the family on to an animal. Usually throughout the process of using miniature animals, the child will remember that a particular animal represents a particular person in the family. While projecting characteristics of family members on to the animals, the child is able to explore relationships between the animals. Again this exploration is likely to parallel the child's perception of relationships in the family. Now this type of projective thinking requires a level of cognitive development which is not present in younger children particularly those below the age of 7. 

00:07:15
The Symbolic Process 

00:07:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD For younger children below the age of 7 generally, it is usually preferable to use a symbolic process rather than a projective one. Young children are generally adapt to using objects in a symbolic way. They are able to imagine or pretend that an object can be used as a substitute. For example a child might pickup a cup, hold it to the ear and pretend that it is a telephone. The cup doesn't need to look like a telephone, but can be used as a symbol to represent a telephone. It might be useful at this point to show you some objects that can be used as symbols. 

00:08:10
Examples of Symbols 

00:08:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I have a wide variety of symbols, some of which I have here to show you. I have some general items like a rock and some stones and some shells like these. I have some small boxes with lids on them and these are particularly useful as they enable the child to put things in them and then close the lid like this. Here are some jewelry and the house. A basket with some very brightly colored marbles inside. I have some glass jars and bottles. A small book and some spectacles and I have some very colorful feathers. I have a padlock and some other ornaments like this very decorative plate. If you're like me, you'll quite enjoy collecting symbols as you have seen you can use any objects as symbols however, a word of warning when working with the young children never use small objects that can be swallowed or used in other inappropriate ways. Now that I have shown you some of my symbols, let me return to discussing the difference between projective and symbolic processes. 

00:09:50
The difference between Projective & Symbolic processes 

00:09:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The difference between projective and symbolic thinking is fairly subtle that needs to be understood. When a child is thinking projectively as when working with miniature animals, they project ideas which they already have in their mind about the personal traits, characteristics and behaviors of family members onto the animal in question. In symbolic work an object can be used to represent someone or something else. Even when an object is used to represent a person the child does not require to project personal traits and characteristics and behaviors onto to the object. The object or symbol is just a representation of the person in question. Additionally, objects can be used as symbols to represent emotions. For example, I could use this rock to represent feeling angry or this shell to represent feeling sad. However, I need to stress that in symbolic work, objects are not just used to represent people or experiences for feelings. They can be used to represent simply anything. For example, objects can be used to represent things like houses, vehicles, fences, walls and containers or living things like plants and animals. In fact, anything at all even though they are not used projectively. Symbols can be very powerful. Imagine that a child uses a medicine bottle like this to represent a beer bottle that had been used in an attack that child had witnessed. Once the bottle had been chosen as a symbol for the beer bottle it might then trigger off either conscious or unconscious thoughts and memories associated with the attack. As a counselor, I have found that a child's unconscious thoughts and memories about a past event or experience can be more easily accessed when symbols are used to represent people or things that were physically around when the event occurred. The symbols enable the child to get in touch and talk about the past event or experience more easily and freely. Sometimes a single object used as a symbol will remind a child of a specific experience, event, person or period of time. As a result, the object becomes a symbol to represent the experience, memory or person that is the focus of attention. When I choose this present as a symbol, it reminds me of Christmas. It doesn't just to remind me of the presents that I get at Christmas, but it reminds me also of all the other things that happened for me around that time. The symbol anchors the child while talking about the event. Exploration of the characteristics of such a symbol with a child can help the child to get more fully in touch with information about the event or experience. I should point out that there are a number of different ways of using symbols. However, today I'm going to talk about the use of symbols in the sand tray. 

00:14:05
Sand tray work 

00:14:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The use of symbols in a sand tray was originally pioneered by Margaret Lowenfeld since that time other workers have developed a number of other ways of working with symbols in a sand tray to achieve various goals, just as there are a number of ways of using symbols. There are also a number of different ways of working in the sand tray. In this lecture, I'm going to talk about the use of symbols in a sand tray to enable me to join with the young child and to help them to share with me their story with regard to a particular problem or event that might be causing them some distress. Additionally, I'll explain how to encourage the child to play freely with the symbols in the sand tray and then how to process a child's work by exploring the symbols in the sand tray. Firstly, let me talk about practical details. If you're going to use symbols for working in the sand tray, you need to decide how to store them. It's important for the symbols to be set out so that they can be easily seen and picked up by the child. If they are set out in this way, the child will be more easily able to choose suitable symbols for particular purposes. Some counselors like to have shells near to the sand tray with their working. However, personally I prefer to use a number of trays like these. They can be moved around easily so that the child can easily look through the symbols to choose the ones they want. 

00:16:00
The Sand tray 

00:16:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Here is my sand tray, notice that it is quite large being about 75 cm x 75 cm. I like to have a large sand tray for a number of reasons. A large sand tray enables the child to create different scenarios in different parts of the tray. For example the child may use part of the sand tray to build the picture of the home environment and another part of the tray to build the picture of the school environment. Additionally, the large sand tray enables me to draw attention to unused parts of the tray. The child may then tell me more of this story by using the unused part of the tray. You'll notice that my sand tray is square and not circular because I think that it is advantageous to have corners in the sand tray. This is because sometimes a child will put symbol into corner for a particular purpose. For example, the child might be reluctant to put some symbols in the tray at all and might place them in a corner out of the way so that they are not prominent. The sand in my tray is good, clean sand, but not too fine. At one stage, I had some lovely fine white sand in my sand tray only to discover that young children were excellent in creating a sand stone with it. I have painted the bottom of my sand tray blue. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD This makes it easy for a child to move the sand aside and create a lake or swimming pool if they want to. When I'm using the sand tray, I prefer to sit on the floor beside the tray with the child sitting opposite to me on the other side of the tray. 

00:18:10
How to work in the sand tray 

00:18:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Let's have a look at how I might work with a child who comes to me with a specific problem or a child who has experienced a specific crisis. The first thing I do is to show the child my collection of symbols and allow them to handle them. When talking to the child in relation to a particular problem, the usefulness of the sand tray work will depend a lot on the opening instructions as this will influence the child's work. I explained that I like to use the symbols in a special way in the sand tray and that I would like the child to help me to understand their life and what's been happening to them by choosing objects to put in the tray to make a picture or tell a story. The initial instruction which I give to the child will depend on what I know about the child situation and past experiences. For example I might say make a picture or story in the sand tray about your life or make a picture in the sand tray about you when you were little or make a picture in a sand tray about yesterday. Sometimes I will know that a child has experienced a particular trauma. Imagine I know that a boy has been traumatized by a car accident I might start by reminding the child that I know that he was involved in the accident. I might then ask him to think about what happened earlier in the day when the accident happened and to make a picture in the sand tray to tell me the story of what happened starting from earlier in the day. Let me give you another illustration about how I might go about using the symbols in the sand tray. To do this I will invent a client. 

00:20:15
An imagined case study 

00:20:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I would like to make it clear that this client is fictitious and the description does not relate to any particular client that I have heard about or have myself worked with. Let's imagine that I was working with a young child of about six years of age, we will call him Jimmy. Let's imagine that Jimmy lives with his mother and two younger sisters and that Jimmy's mother and father have recently separated following several incidents where Jimmy's father became angry and destroyed property. Jimmy has witnessed his mother and father fighting and as a result has become withdrawn and anxious. Jimmy, his mother and two sisters are now living in a new house and Jimmy has not had contact with his father since they moved. I would begin by explaining to Jimmy that I understood that recently he had moved house. I would suggest that to help me understand more fully what his life had been like for him that he might like to make a picture or story in the sand tray using these things of mine that is my symbols. Initially, I might invite Jimmy to choose an object to represent his new house and to put it somewhere in the sand. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I might ask him to choose some objects to represent the people who live in the new house. He would choose a figure for his mother, for himself, and his two sisters. I might then ask Jimmy can you show me what happened before you moved into your new house. At this stage, Jimmy might volunteer information that reveals that mummy and daddy had a fight and Jimmy might disclose that after the fight he, his mother and his sisters moved out. I might then say can you show me what happened in the sand and invite Jimmy to choose an object to represent the place he moved from and place it in the sand somewhere. I would say put another object in the sand to represent your old house. And then I would ask him to show me how his mother and his sisters moved to the new place. I would say can you show me in the sand how you, your mother and your sisters moved to the new place. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Jimmy might say this is where we lived and we got in the car and we drove to the new house. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD You'll notice that I'm moving the figurines myself in this lecture. However, when working with the child, I avoid touching the symbols and instead ask the child to move them. This way I can see whether the child is keen or reluctant to move the symbols and can notice how they are placed relative to each other. Jimmy might also have shown me that his father still lives in the old house. I might feedback that I notice that Jimmy, his mother and sisters are over here and that his father is over here. Spontaneously, Jimmy might disclose information with regard to his father who continues to live in the old house. Jimmy might also disclose new information about how he himself feels with regard to the move. Let's imagine that Jimmy discloses that he previously lived next door to his school. And that he could walk to school easily everyday. He may disclose that he now attends a new school. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD And that he only has one friend. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Compared with a number of friends that he had at his old school. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I would ask him to put symbols to represent his old friend into the picture. Jimmy might also disclose that his father has tried to visit him at the new house. I might ask Jimmy to show me in the sand tray how that happened. He might move the symbol representing his father like this. 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I might ask Jimmy, if there is anything else he would like to put in his picture. At this stage, Jimmy might work quietly choosing symbols to represent other important things or circumstances in his life. He might place some stones and some shells, some trees. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In the corner of the sand tray and slowly a picture would develop of what life had been like and is currently like for Jimmy. I would try to judge when the story was finished by noticing when the child's energy had dropped. I might ask Jimmy, have you finished or would you like to do more? Jimmy might like to do more. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD When the child indicates that they have completed their picture I asked what they can tell me about the picture. If the child doesn't respond spontaneously, I might prompt them by pointing out what I had noticed. For example, I might say to Jimmy I notice that you've put some shells and stones in this corner. There are some trees. He might respond by telling me that this where his grandmother and grandfather live. How he enjoys visiting them and how he has not visited them for a very long time. He might tell me something about his grandparents such as this is grandma's garden. She has flowers in her garden. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD While talking to me about his grandparents, he may be reminded of the cubby house that his grandfather and he built together. He might add that to the picture. I might notice that Jimmy becomes excited and more talkative when discussing his grandparents and their house. He might say these are grandpa's glasses that he uses when he reads the paper and this is grandma's favorite pillow. I might notice how different his emotional presentation is compared to when he was talking about moving from his old house to his new house. I might also ask Jimmy about other parts of his picture. For example, I might wonder what is like for his dad to be living here and for his mother and sisters to be here. It's likely that Jimmy would tell me about how he believes his father's feeling and about how he, his mother and sisters are feeling. By inviting Jimmy to tell me about his picture, I can discover how Jimmy feels and how he has coped with the changes in his life. I can also discover what his current needs are and what his hopes are for the future. Of course we need to recognize that each child is unique and that each child will have a different set of experiences and responses to those experiences. Sometimes children will come to counseling because their parents or other adults have noticed that their behavior has changed. But they do not appear to have been any specific event or events to trigger the concerning behavior. Sometimes, in these circumstances, children are not aware themselves of why they feel unhappy or anxious. Now it is not unusual for children like this to be weary of the counseling situation, because they find the process threatening or worrying. 

00:31:10
Working with a child who feels anxious about the counseling process 

00:31:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Let's now have a look at how we might work with symbols in the sand tray with the child who finds the counseling process threatening or worrying. In this instance I might simply invite the child to play with the symbols in the sand tray. I would let them know that I intended to sit quietly and just keep them accompany while they play. In circumstances like this, I would be nondirective and passive and not actively participate in the child's play or creativity until the child had finished. I might at times help the child to solve problems with regard to playing with the objects in the sand, for example, by positioning or balancing objects If I notice that, that was what the child wanted to do. During this process, I would use the skill of observation and might sometimes feedback to the child, anything I noticed about the child's behavior or mood. This brings us to a point where I need to talk about the skill of observation. In the first of this series of lectures, I described a number of counseling skills that are useful when working with children. Additional to the skills I described the skill of observation is of major importance. 

00:32:50
The skill of Observation 

00:32:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD You may have noticed that while describing the works that I did with Jimmy in the sand tray on a number of occasions I feedback to him information that I had observed. Observing a child's play is central to gaining an idea or formulating a hypothesis about the child's frame of mind and emotional state. Additionally, and most importantly it is sometimes useful to feedback to the child what you have observed. Let's first consider how we might observe the child's play and then how we might usefully feedback our observations. 

00:33:40
Observation of the child's play 

00:33:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Observation of the child's play should take into account the following. 

00:33:45
The developmental level of the child's play The child's emotional presentation Themes that emerge in the play 

00:33:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The developmental level of the child's play. The child's emotional presentation and themes that emerge in the play, particularly when working in the sand tray it is useful to look for compositions and arrangements and the child's choice of symbols. Let's look at each of these in turn. 

00:34:30
Observation of the developmental level of the child's play 

00:34:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It can be useful to understand whether a child demonstrates play skills that are considered to be mature or immature for the age. Firstly, I tried to decide whether the play is exploratory. For example, does a child simply enjoy the texture of the sand without having any real purpose in their play. I'd like to observe how the child uses the sand. For example, how they scoop or spread or stroke the sand, whether they dig holes or make shapes with the sand or whether they create patterns or hide objects in the sand. Sometimes, the child's play may be more functional and they will examine the symbols individually and comment on them and then place them in the sand. They might look at them carefully. In this kind of play, sometimes the child will sort symbols in groups according to size, color or other common characteristics without any meaningful connection, like this. 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Sometimes the child will demonstrate imaginative pretend play. Using the objects in a way that creates a fictitious story and where the symbols are meaningfully connected in relation to each other perhaps like this. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD They may create a hill and on it put a very powerful wizard(ph). Below some fierce animals and indicates some protection by using the fence. 

00:37:05
Observation of the child's emotional presentation 

00:37:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Observing how the child behaves during the sand tray work can also give useful information. For example, how does the child approach the play? Are they meticulous, aggressive, lethargic, impulsive or hesitant? Does a child continually seek reinforcement and support from you, the counselor. By watching the child's facial expression, I can sometimes observe whether their mood changes as the story unfolds. 

00:37:45
Observation of themes that emerge during the child's play 

00:37:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It can be useful to hypothesize about any themes that emerge during the child's play. Themes which emerge can give clear directions for future work. Sometimes, themes will relate to issues involving safety or caring or being powerful and strong. 

00:38:20
Observation of compositions and arrangements 

00:38:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Usually a child will demonstrate play that reflects a coherence story or picture in which everything is meaningfully connected. However, sometimes they may present special compositions and arrangements. For example, you might notice that the child spreads the objects out across the whole tray somewhat chaotically without very much relationship between the objects. This often results in an overfilled sand tray. Alternatively, you might find that the child groups the symbols in peculiar combinations that give us some what bizarre impression. For example a dinosaur on the top of the house. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD You may find that a child repeatedly frames or encloses the symbols in fences or boundaries. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Sometimes the child will work only in the center of the tray. Alternatively, they may choose to work near the edges or in a corner of the tray. It can be interesting to note whether there is a particular place in the sand tray that dominates the story and from which most activity in the story originates. 

00:40:00
Observation of the child's choice of symbols 

00:40:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It can be useful to observe the qualities of the symbols that the child uses. For example, does the child choose animals mostly? 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Like this or does the child prefer aggressive and violent symbols. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:41:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Perhaps the child deliberately seeks out symbols that reflect magical or powerful properties like this. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I observe not only the choice of objects, but also the way they are chosen. I notice whether the child thinks about the symbol they choose or whether they snatch it immediately from the shelf. 

00:41:40
Feedback of observations 

00:41:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD As I mentioned earlier, it can sometimes be useful to feedback to the child what we have observed. This gives the child an opportunity to connect more fully with the symbols and their meanings and to share their thoughts with me. For example, I might make the following feedback statements. I notice that you have put these objects close to these objects. I see that you put these objects in the corner of the sand tray. All these objects are inside the fence. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD This part of the sand tray is completely empty. There is a big hill here. I notice that you've chosen a rock for your best friend. You look worried as you did that. You seem to enjoy that. I noticed that in your picture there is a lot of fighting. By feeding back to the child what you notice you raise the child's awareness of what they are doing and how they are doing it. As a result, they are likely to give you additional information or to continue telling you about this story. 

00:43:20
Finishing a sand tray session 

00:43:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD When a child has finished their work in the sand tray, I will usually ask them whether they would like to show the sand tray picture to the parent or parents or whether they would like to keep what they've done private? Naturally, if some important information has emerged that the parents need to know. I'll talk to the child in the way described in my first lecture about how the important information is to be passed on to the parents. Often when a parent or parents sees the sand tray picture constructed by their child, they will ask questions about the picture and a spontaneous discussion between the child and the parent will occur. Frequently, in this discussion, the child will give the parents important information which might enable them to take action to deal with whatever is troubling their child. Sometimes, just talking to their parents about the sand tray picture will be cathartic for the child, enabling them to feel better. Finally, before the child leaves, it is important to let the child know that the symbols will made to be put back into the storage trays. If the child is not told this, they might expect that the picture they have made will still be in the sand tray the next time they come to counseling. Usually, I'll say to the child, these things need to be put back into the trays, would you like to put them back or would you like me to put them back or would you like me to help you put them back? This gives the child some choice in controlling the situation. Now, finally before finishing this lecture, I would like to talk to you briefly about the tutorial. 

00:45:25
The Tutorial 

00:45:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD We've now come to the end of this lecture. You might find it useful to continue your learning by participating in the tutorial which is described in the lectures manual. If you want to take part in the tutorial, you will need to have the set of symbols. As I explained in the lecture, you can use any small object as a symbol. So just by walking around at home or in your garden, you should be able to find a number of small objects that you can use as symbols in the tutorial. In the next lecture, I'll give an overview of the process of counseling a child that I use as a model when counseling children over a series of sessions. The model illustrates a framework of practice that my husband David and I have developed in order to help the child to feel better and to make changes to their thinking and behavior. I hope that you've enjoyed this lecture and found it to be both interesting and useful.
