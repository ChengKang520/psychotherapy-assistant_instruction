00:00:00
JOSEPH WOLPE What is your name? 

00:01:15
TOM Uh, Tom. 

00:01:15
JOSEPH WOLPE How old are you? 

00:01:15
TOM Uh, 39 years old. 

00:01:20
JOSEPH WOLPE What is your complaint? 

00:01:20
TOM Well, the biggest complaint is um, severe sleeping problems, um, intermittent depression, mood swings, um, at times inappropriate anger. 

00:01:35
[sil.] 

00:01:35
JOSEPH WOLPE How long have you had these symptoms? 

00:01:35
TOM Mmm, approximately 5 years. 

00:01:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Uh, can you relate the onset to anything in particular? 

00:01:50
TOM Yes, um. 

00:01:55
JOSEPH WOLPE What can you relate the onset too. 

00:02:00
TOM Um, before I used to um, I was employed as a police officer. On a particular day I received a radio call, I received a radio call to go to a house where there was a domestic disturbance going on. And as the whole situation worked itself out I was forced to shoot and kill a man that was armed with a gun. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Can not hear! 

00:02:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Just repeat that. 

00:02:35
TOM Okay, um, I went, I received a call, I was a police officer in the past and I received a call to go to a house on a domestic disturbance. And um, at this scene of this incident I was forced to shoot and kill a man with a gun. 

00:02:45
JOSEPH WOLPE You, you were forced to shoot a man who was holding a gun? 

00:02:50
TOM Yes, he was pointing it. 

00:02:55
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, what, what was the effect of this on you? 

00:03:00
TOM Well, there were several of us involved in this situation. But um, I was the primary officer and um, so, I had the majority of the um, I guess you'd say of the responsibility for the death of this man. Who was a mental health patient and uh, we didn't realize that at the time actually. We could only deal with the situation as it was. And um, shortly there after, in fact, by the very next day I was having um, extreme anxiety and paranoia. Um, immediately difficultly sleeping, depression, hyper, just being very defensive about a lot of the situations. I went back to work probably within a week, and um, one of my first, one of the first things I did when I returned to work is I made a traffic stop with a man with a very unimportant type of violation. It was a equipment violation on his car. He was very rude and naturally I became very rude in response to that. And the situation almost degenerated into a physical fight before I saw something wrong. I apologized to the man, he apologized to me, we shook hands. And I drove away from that incident and I basically stopped making traffic stops anymore and contacting people unless I absolutely had too. 

00:04:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, in fact, you, you were ordered to kill this man. Is that right? 

00:04:30
TOM Yes. 

00:04:30
JOSEPH WOLPE So, so the responsibility wasn't yours. 

00:04:35
TOM Well, that's true I didn't have any choice. I was, there was absolutely no way out of the situation at all. 

00:04:40
JOSEPH WOLPE What, what is the immediate effect on you? How did you feel when you did this thing? 

00:04:50
[sil.] 

00:04:50
TOM Well, I felt I had done something wrong because um, I guess the major difficult was that I didn't just shoot him like one time like everybody thinks you're suppose to do when they watch movies. I was scared and um, I shot him more than once until I was sure he wasn't going to get back up and hurt me. 

00:05:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, uh, what, what was the feeling that you had? 

00:05:25
TOM Anger, anger that he was trying to kill me? 

00:05:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Anger, that he was trying to kill you. And then when you shoot him, was it still anger? 

00:05:30
TOM No, it was a strange feeling. It was gone, it was gone for a short period of time. And then it was um, a guilty feeling that um, just guilty feeling that I'd been angry at him and that I killed him because I'd been angry was my immediate thought. But it really wasn't the way it was but that was what my thoughts were. 

00:05:55
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, so how long did you go on feeling guilty? 

00:06:00
TOM A couple of years. 

00:06:00
JOSEPH WOLPE So, it started in and it stayed at a uniform level or did it fluctuate over a couple of years. 

00:06:10
TOM It would fluctuate and cognitively I knew that I knew that I had done anything wrong. I knew that I had absolutely no choice in this situation, at all. And one of the biggest difficulties is that the next day we found out that the gun that he pointed at us was empty. He had intended on committing suicide but because of his religion he couldn't do it because he wouldn't go to heaven. So basically, he manipulated this whole entire situation so that we would kill him. 

00:06:40
JOSEPH WOLPE So, so, in fact it turned out that you were manipulated into aiding in a suicide. 

00:06:45
TOM Right. 

00:06:45
JOSEPH WOLPE But that didn't male any difference to the feeling that you had or did it? 

00:06:55
TOM No, it really didn't. Well, I, I look for every alternative to see if there's anything different I could of done. But uh, you know, there just wasn't anything differently I could of done. 

00:07:05
JOSEPH WOLPE So, you had a kind of uh, an under current of guilt for the next two years. 

00:07:10
TOM Right. 

00:07:15
JOSEPH WOLPE You, you mentioned that um, that you also had other uh, changes, for example sleep problems. 

00:07:20
TOM Yes. 

00:07:20
JOSEPH WOLPE When did that, when did that begin. 

00:07:25
TOM Uh, almost immediately. It would, generally what I could do, I could go to sleep just fine, it's after, sometimes as little as two hours. 

00:07:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:07:35
TOM I'm wide awake and can't go back to sleep. And sometimes that, the reason I would wake up because a nightmare about, usually not about the specific same incident but something very similar. And I guess what my fear was, was over reacting in the situation. I was like, I was angry and I was afraid of hurting somebody else from being angry. 

00:08:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm, mmm. Well now, when these other symptoms like uh, inappropriate anger and uh, what else. 

00:08:15
TOM Mood swings. 

00:08:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Mmm, depression. 

00:08:15
TOM Depression, yes. 

00:08:20
JOSEPH WOLPE Did, did these also begin and sort of continue from this or what? 

00:08:25
TOM It slowly built up because after this incident um, there is a funny sort of peer pressure in the police department not to talk about these sort of things with, you know, you're suppose to be like on TV. You shoot someone and you go out to dinner and have a good time and that's the end of it. That's your entire concern. Well, that's not the way I felt at all. 

00:08:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:08:45
TOM And so I didn't really feel I had any sort of outlet to talk to anybody about this, and the only person that I was able to talk to was a psychologist that was employed by the police department. Who at the time I didn't trust at all because I thought well anything I tell him he's going to eventually, you know, tell everybody in administration. So I didn't. 

00:09:05
JOSEPH WOLPE At what stage did you begin to see the psychologist? 

00:09:15
TOM I beg your pardon? 

00:09:15
JOSEPH WOLPE At what stage did you begin to see the psychologist. 

00:09:20
TOM Um, well we were ordered to the very same day. Then over the several weeks I would occasionally to his office and talk. Um, after he, it's funny. Eventually he lost his contract with the city and at that point we started working together and I feel like at that point I was able to trust him because. 

00:09:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. So, was it suppose to be therapy? 

00:09:45
TOM Yes. 

00:09:45
JOSEPH WOLPE And did it help you? 

00:09:50
TOM Uh, not very much. 

00:09:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Uh, you say, you, you I, I gather you went on feeling much the same for about two years. 

00:09:55
TOM Actually longer, it was probably pretty consistently three and a half years. 

00:10:05
JOSEPH WOLPE So, three and a half years. And, and uh, uh, since that time which means 18 months, you have been better. 

00:10:10
TOM It's getting better, yes. I still have the sleep problems. Usually if some sort of stress, some other sort of stress. Or if I perceive some sort of threat to either me or my family situation, then I, my reaction doesn't seem appropriate. 

00:10:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Why what happens? 

00:10:35
TOM I get real, I get very angry. Um, I don't hurt anybody but to avoid that I just basically back out of the situation and just leave. I've cut off friendships. It's been a problem because my wife, the wife I was married to when all this happened we got a divorce. And since then I've been married in the last year. And I think it's causing some difficulties because some of the friends that she's had have stayed away as a result of this I think. She doesn't complain but I, I have a feeling that that's why they're not coming around. 

00:11:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Do you think that emotional state had anything to do with the break up of your marriage? 

00:11:15
TOM No it was the other way around. The break up of the marriage was the result of the emotional state. My ex-wife complained that I was um, emotionally unavailable to her. Which she was right. 

00:11:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:25
TOM I felt very isolated . And my primary, my friendship relationship was with a dog that I had, so. 

00:11:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:35
TOM So it was. 

00:11:40
JOSEPH WOLPE You say that 18 months ago you began to feel better. 

00:11:45
TOM Right. 

00:11:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Can you, can you associate that feeling better with anything? 

00:11:50
TOM Um, becoming engaged to my current wife. 

00:11:50
JOSEPH WOLPE I see. 

00:11:50
TOM That, that helped a great deal because and I also moved from that region of the state I lived in at the time. Um, I made definite plans about leaving. 

00:12:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:00
TOM Um, law enforcement all together after this incident happened I quit the police department the very next year. 

00:12:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:10
TOM Took a job in a less threatening position in law enforcement. And then once I left that all together then it's helped considerably. 

00:12:20
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, would you say in these, well there was sort of fairly quick change 18 months ago or has it been a, a continuing improvement. 

00:12:30
TOM A continuing improvement. It wasn't an abrupt change. 

00:12:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:30
TOM And it's slowly getting better. Like the nightmares have decreased to very infrequent but the sleep disturbance is still fairly consistent. 

00:12:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, uh, just to get a quantitative impression, um, how, how often were you getting nightmares before 18 months ago and how often do you get them now? Approximately. 

00:12:55
TOM Before sometimes two or three times a night. 

00:12:55
JOSEPH WOLPE And now? 

00:13:00
TOM Now, maybe every two or three weeks. 

00:13:00
JOSEPH WOLPE And um, what about the other symptoms, the depression. 

00:13:10
TOM Depression is not very, is not that frequent any longer and it's not that severe. Um, generally that will be centered um, on some type of um, outside stress, like career stress. Whether you're going to get into graduate school, something along those lines. Failures that normally I would just blow off as not being that important tend to bother me a little bit more than I think they aught to. 

00:13:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Failures like what? 

00:13:35
TOM Well, I haven't failed at anything but it's the fear of failing is what bothers me so much. 

00:13:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, what about anger, inappropriate or excessive anger? 

00:13:45
TOM That is a little bit of a problem. Um, if, if somebody causes a problem that I feel threatens me or wife or something of that sort I respond very rigidly, which I'm not used to be rigid. I used to be a very easy going person. And even my wife tells me that I'm not as much as I probably aught to be. And I agree with her, I tend to, normally I'm very flexible and easy going. But when I perceive this threat I become very rigid, very defensive. And I had a couple of little difficulties with my current mother-in-law. My responses just is an over response. 

00:14:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, are there any outside situations that upset you. For example, things that you might witness on television? 

00:14:45
TOM Yes, yes. 

00:14:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Like what? 

00:14:50
TOM I generally don't go watch um, well one of my wife's favorite kind of programs is detective programs. I don't watch those at all, I just don't. And um, certain movies. Um, where in particular, where there's a situation, where, let's say a police officer has to make a decision whether he has to shoot somebody or not. Those cause me a lot of difficulty. And I've found myself getting very tense at. I'd be visiting other friends and we'll be watching a video or something and when this happens I basically get very tense and get up and just have to basically get up and leave the room. 

00:15:25
JOSEPH WOLPE When you have nightmares, what, what is there content? 

00:15:30
TOM Huh, one night, once in awhile if it has anything to do with a specific incident it's a very short thing yet, sort of quick sort of nightmare and I immediately wake up. 

00:15:45
JOSEPH WOLPE What, what is the kind of thing that will do that to you. 

00:15:45
TOM Uh, usually the man I shot will be there, he'll have a gun, I shot him and I'll wake up. Other dreams will be something along the lines, where I'll be in a situation where um, where somebody basically does something that would force me to be involved in a fight. And my response is way beyond just a normal fight. It's like pounding somebody's head into the floor, something like that. Which I'm not that kind of person, never was and it bothers me. 

00:16:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, now um, you said that you, you can be upset by certain movies like uh, I suppose there's such a thing as uh, police officers getting, getting ready t, too start firing at somebody or. 

00:16:35
TOM Mm-hmm, yes. 

00:16:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, so, well let me give you a way of expressing anger, you know, emotional upset. Think, think of the worst anxiety that you've ever had and, and call that 100. Then think of being absolutely calm and call that 0. Now on the scale I've just given you, how would you rate yourself at this moment. 

00:17:00
TOM 60. 

00:17:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Is that because of the audience and so, or because of what we're talking, talking about? 

00:17:05
TOM Because of what we're talking about. 

00:17:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Because of what we're talking about. Okay, now um, Just suppose it's a normal night and uh, your sitting at home and you're watching television and there's this kind of scene where there's a threat of police firing on somebody. How high would your anxiety level go? Approximately. 

00:17:30
TOM It's gone as high as I would say, 85. 

00:17:35
JOSEPH WOLPE 85. 

00:17:35
TOM Yes. 

00:17:35
JOSEPH WOLPE So, even in that situation. Now sometimes you say you have nightmare, nightmares which involve the image of the person you shot. What is your anxiety level go to then? 

00:17:50
TOM 95. 

00:17:50
JOSEPH WOLPE And then there's the other nightmare, which is, which is not that put sort or related in some way. Is that, is that situation as much or not quite as much? 

00:18:00
TOM Not quite as much. 

00:18:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. Well give me a specific example of, of such another nightmare. 

00:18:10
TOM Um, I'm basically driving down the street and there's a man in a convertible Cadillac that uh, cuts me off. And uh, we exchange words and when he pulls over I, we get in a fight. And basically what I do is grab him and just knock his head into the street. And repeatedly pound his head into the street. 

00:18:35
JOSEPH WOLPE And how much would that produce, 90? 

00:18:40
TOM No, 75. 

00:18:40
JOSEPH WOLPE So that's, so that's less than, than, the movie of the uh, of the police man, hmm? 

00:18:45
TOM Mm-hmm. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:19:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Are there any other kinds of experiences that you have uh, that are sort of this direction and produce some disturbance but less? 

00:19:20
[sil.] 

00:19:25
TOM No, I don't think so. 

00:19:25
JOSEPH WOLPE So, it's either pretty high like this or it's nothing. 

00:19:30
TOM Pretty much, if I like I say. If, if I perceive a threat to my family then that, that, the stress level goes very high. Um. 

00:19:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, what kind of threat do you have in mind? 

00:19:45
TOM Well, I will say that there are certain friends that my wife has that were not completely pleased with the fact that we got married. And I think there are one or two of them that um, they did some manipulating to try to see that, that didn't happen. Now to me that was on a par about a 90. 

00:20:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, uh, these, this is something disturbing but is it, is it in what you might call it the same ball park as these other things you're talking about? Is it related or is it just something that annoys you? 

00:20:25
TOM What bothers me about it, is my response, I don't think is appropriate. What happened is not that important, I know that. But my response to it escalated it to where it became very important. 

00:20:40
JOSEPH WOLPE So, uh, I think what you're saying is that uh, it's a reflection of a sort of emotional sensitivity which was sort of induced by this experience you had. 

00:20:50
TOM Yes. 

00:20:55
JOSEPH WOLPE But, it's not in the sort of line of things that belong to that experience. 

00:20:55
TOM No. 

00:21:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. Very good. Now, let me get some background uh, out of you. Um, where were you born? 

00:21:10
TOM Texas. 

00:21:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Do you have any brothers or sisters? 

00:21:15
TOM I have one sister. 

00:21:15
JOSEPH WOLPE And what's her age? 

00:21:20
TOM She's 37. 

00:21:20
JOSEPH WOLPE So she's two years younger. 

00:21:20
TOM Yes. 

00:21:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Are your parents alive? 

00:21:25
TOM No, my father's dead. 

00:21:25
JOSEPH WOLPE What did he die of? 

00:21:25
TOM Cancer. 

00:21:25
JOSEPH WOLPE At what, at what age? 

00:21:30
TOM 62. 

00:21:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Was your father good to you as a child? 

00:21:35
TOM When he was home, yes. 

00:21:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Yeah, you seem to suggest he wasn't home that much. 

00:21:40
TOM Right. 

00:21:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Uh, why what was his occupation? 

00:21:45
TOM Uh, he was in the service and he generally had occupations where he traveled. 

00:21:50
JOSEPH WOLPE I see. Uh, did he punish you? 

00:21:55
TOM Never. 

00:22:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, what about your mother? 

00:22:00
TOM Never. 

00:22:00
JOSEPH WOLPE She was good to you and interested in you? 

00:22:00
TOM Yes. 

00:22:05
JOSEPH WOLPE And she never punished you? 

00:22:05
TOM Uh, no and if she did it was only out of frustration because I was, you know, taking full advantage of the situation. 

00:22:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Did you have much in the way of religious training? 

00:22:15
TOM We were raised as Catholics till about 10 years old, then Baptist. 

00:22:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, has religion been an important in life in a sense that you've been concerned about how you're behavior would uh, concern God? 

00:22:35
TOM I would say, so. I'm not, I don't go to church and I probably will ever go to church but I do think there's a certain sense of that being there. 

00:22:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Did you have any childhood fears? 

00:22:55
[sil.[ 

00:22:55
TOM Snakes, but I still don't like snakes. But that's not. 

00:23:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. Um, you didn't fear the dark and violence and things of that sort. 

00:23:05
TOM No. 

00:23:05
JOSEPH WOLPE Where did you go to school? 

00:23:10
TOM Everywhere from Michigan, to San Diego, Southern California, Oklahoma. 

00:23:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Did you like school? 

00:23:15
TOM Um, I hated high school. I liked grade school. But high school was very difficult because we moved so frequently. But once I got into college, I loved it. 

00:23:25
JOSEPH WOLPE I see. Um, how did, how did you do as a student? 

00:23:35
TOM Mmm, not very well. 

00:23:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Partly because of the moving. 

00:23:40
TOM Right, but in college I did very well. 

00:23:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, we're coming to that. Did you um, part in sports? 

00:23:50
TOM No. 

00:23:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Did you make friends? 

00:23:50
TOM Yes. 

00:23:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Were there any uh, people who you found antagonistic to you in school? 

00:24:00
TOM No, nothing out of the ordinary. 

00:24:05
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, let me go back a minute to sports. Were you good at sports? 

00:24:05
TOM No. 

00:24:10
JOSEPH WOLPE So it didn't figure very much in your? 

00:24:10
TOM No. 

00:24:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. Um, at age did you graduate from high school? 

00:24:20
TOM Um, 18. 

00:24:20
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm, and then you went on to college to do what? 

00:24:20
TOM Oh I wanted to be a teacher and um, at the particular time no one was being employed as a teacher and so I finished up my degree in law enforcement because it was a steady job and it paid very well. And so I ended up in law enforcement by default I guess. 

00:24:40
JOSEPH WOLPE I see. At what age did you begin this work in law enforcement? 

00:24:45
TOM 25. 

00:24:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, that's 14 years ago. And in general did, did you like that work. 

00:24:55
TOM It wasn't in any way stimulating intellectually in any way shape or form. It was interesting because if you treated it um, if you treated people well it was rewarding job. But there were aspects of administrative bureaucracy that I never fit very well into. 

00:25:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, now, at what age did you have your uh, uh, first erotic feelings? 

00:25:25
TOM Five. 

00:25:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Five, Okay, in relation to what were they? 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:30
JOSEPH WOLPE To a person or? 

00:25:35
TOM Girls, yeah. 

00:25:35
JOSEPH WOLPE To girls, okay. 

00:25:35
TOM Maybe it was six years old. 

00:25:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. Well, we'll have to do this part sort of a summary. Um, at what age did you first begin to have uh, uh, did you have a serious relationship. That you feel emotional involved with somebody? 

00:25:55
TOM 17. 

00:25:55
JOSEPH WOLPE Um, what did you like about her? 

00:26:00
TOM Outgoing, um, dynamic, a lot of fun. 

00:26:05
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. And for how long did this relationship go on? 

00:26:10
TOM That was my first wife. It lasted 19 years. 

00:26:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Did you get on well with her? 

00:26:15
TOM Pretty much, yes. 

00:26:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. And how was the sexual side of the marriage? 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:25
TOM I'd say a 6 on the scale of 10. 

00:26:30
JOSEPH WOLPE What, what were the major problems in the marriage? 

00:26:35
TOM In-laws, in-laws. 

00:26:40
JOSEPH WOLPE In-laws. 

00:26:40
TOM In-laws is a big one. We were different races and it was very difficult for her family to not accepting somebody that was white. Um, she was demanding. Um, I tend to be very easy going. And I think that she married me thinking she was going to change me. 

00:26:55
JOSEPH WOLPE I see. 

00:26:55
TOM And I don't change very well. 

00:26:55
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, how would you, how would you rate your present marriage? 

00:27:05
TOM I've only been married less than a year so it's still a 10. 

00:27:10
JOSEPH WOLPE It's still a 10. 

00:27:10
TOM Yes. 

00:27:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, I'm not, I'm not asking you to predict the future. But, but it sounds pretty good right now. 

00:27:15
TOM Well, I've watched Dr. Ellison, he doesn't think it's going to last very long. Yes, it's good. 

00:27:20
JOSEPH WOLPE We'll don't pay attention to these psychologist. 

00:27:25
TOM Okay. 

00:27:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Um, well know I think I've got enough information from you and um, let me ask you, when I asked you before what your score was on that scale, you said 60. What's you're score now? 

00:27:50
TOM Right now about 30. 

00:27:55
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, that's good. Um, now I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to use this method on you which is, which is not very well known. But it's has been pretty widely used. And, and it comes, uh, it'll assist essentially of you having images I will put before you in, in a certain order. And what has to happen is that your eyes have to follow the point of this pen of while you have these images. But before you have any images I just want to show you how we um, uh, how the, how the um, um, the pen is moved and sort of teach you how to follow, how to follow this object. Now, it's uh, it's sort of um, it's about 14 inches in front of your eyes. Now, I want you to look at it, and I want you to follow the point of the, the pen with your eyes and not move your head at all, okay. 

00:29:10
TOM Mm-hmm. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. No, no difficulty with doing that. 

00:29:20
TOM Okay. 

00:29:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
JOSEPH WOLPE You said, um if you had this image of um, a man with the Cadillac and then you had an argument and then you started to a man with the Cadillac and then you had an argument and then you started fighting with him and then you, eventually pounding his head and so forth. a man with the Cadillac and then you had an argument and then you started Uh, you said your anxiety level would go up to 75. 

00:29:55
TOM Mm-hmm. 

00:29:55
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, will it only go up a man with the Cadillac and then you had an argument and then you started to 75 when you're pounding his head or is it at that level all the time. Rather what I'm asking you is it an earlier stage, and earlier stage of the sequence during which the, the is different. 

00:30:15
TOM I, I suppose it's 75 realistically when the incident is just starting, but when I'm smashing his head it's a little more than that because that's what wakes me up. 

00:30:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. So there you go. Uh, let me get this quite clear. You're saying that when, when the incident begins, when the sort of fighting begins, or arguing, the arguing begins you're already up to 75. 

00:30:40
TOM Yes. 

00:30:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, so what I want you to do now is try and a clear image as can of, of this initial fighting, argumentation. And the moment you have that image I want you to say okay. And the moment you say okay, I'm going to start uh, this eye movement. But you, you must try to hold as clearly as possibly, as possible in your mind that image while the movement of the pen continues. 

00:31:15
TOM Okay. 

00:31:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. So, I'm waiting for you to say okay. 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:30
TOM Okay. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Now did you hold the image throughout? 

00:31:40
TOM It was difficult. I lost it at one point. 

00:31:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, now in the beginning can you what the level of your anxiety was. 

00:31:55
TOM It was about 50. 

00:31:55
JOSEPH WOLPE About 50? 

00:31:55
TOM Yes. 

00:32:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, um, and then you found it difficult to hold the image. 

00:32:00
TOM Yes. 

00:32:05
JOSEPH WOLPE I'm going to do, I'm going to do this again and I want you to hold the image again. Uh, I think it must be difficult for, for people to see. Maybe I should go to the other side. 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:20
JOSEPH WOLPE s that generally better? Well, I think it's better for people over there. Well anyway, we, we can't please everybody. So, now um, once again get exactly the same image. And once again say okay uh, when you're ready. Keep, keep you head absolutely still and move your eyes when the, when the pen begins to move, okay. 

00:32:45
TOM Okay. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:55
TOM Okay. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Now what happened that time? 

00:33:10
TOM It was harder keeping the image. 

00:33:10
JOSEPH WOLPE And how much, how much was the anxiety at the beginning? 

00:33:15
TOM 30. 

00:33:15
JOSEPH WOLPE Anxiety was 30 in the beginning. You better, better move that. 

00:33:20
TOM 30. 

00:33:20
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. It was harder to keep the image, okay. 

00:33:25
TOM Yes. 

00:33:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay. I think we're going to do this once more so uh. Once again tell me, tell me okay when you get the image. 

00:33:40
TOM Okay. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened that time? 

00:33:50
TOM It was easier to keep the image this time. 

00:33:55
JOSEPH WOLPE And how much the anxiety in the beginning? 

00:34:00
TOM It was down to about 20. 

00:34:05
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, we're going to use this image once more. 

00:34:05
TOM Okay. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:10
TOM Okay. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:15
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened that time. 

00:34:30
TOM I could keep the image and it just didn't feel as difficult. 

00:34:35
JOSEPH WOLPE And what about the anxiety? 

00:34:35
TOM Almost non-existent. 

00:34:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Almost non-existent, very good. Now um, what we will do is to go up to next image. Which I'm not quite sure of. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
JOSEPH WOLPE And uh, this image, this image consist of uh, police um, on a television movie getting ready to, to fire on certain people or a certain person. Should be make it a person or people? 

00:35:15
TOM A person. 

00:35:15
JOSEPH WOLPE A person. All right, when you get that, when you get that image clear once again say okay. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:30
TOM Okay. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:35
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened then. 

00:35:35
TOM I could keep the image but the anxiety was still pretty high. 

00:35:45
JOSEPH WOLPE How high was the anxiety? 

00:35:45
TOM At 70. 

00:35:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Anxiety was 70. All right, and uh, and uh, how do you feel now. How is your anxiety right now? 

00:35:55
TOM 40. 

00:35:55
JOSEPH WOLPE 40, is that higher than uh, before we started with this image. 

00:36:00
TOM Yes. 

00:36:05
JOSEPH WOLPE All right um, now, um, it would of been, it would of been an advantage if we would of been able to teach you relaxation but we haven't been able to. All the same, just try to calm your self. And I'll give you a minute or so to calm your self. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:25
JOSEPH WOLPE What's your score now? 

00:36:30
TOM 10, 15. 

00:36:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Very good, 10 is very good. Now then, once again I want you to get the image of these police getting ready to attack this person and then again say okay when, when you have the image. 

00:36:50
TOM Okay. 

00:36:55
[sil.] 

00:37:05
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened? 

00:37:05
TOM Uh, at first it started at about 50 and by the time you stopped with the pen it was down to about 35. 

00:37:10
JOSEPH WOLPE So it went down from 50 to 35. Okay. Very good. Now once again, try to calm your self. 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:25
TOM Okay. 

00:37:30
JOSEPH WOLPE Now, now wait a minute. You said, the, the task this time was to calm your self. Your calmer? 

00:37:35
TOM Yes, I have a particular image I use to do that. 

00:37:40
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, so you, what, what's your anxiety level now? 

00:37:45
TOM Five. 

00:37:45
JOSEPH WOLPE About five, excellent. Now, once again get that image of the police and say, okay when you're ready. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:00
TOM Okay. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:05
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened that time? 

00:38:05
TOM It was much lower. I was able to keep the image fairly consistently. 

00:38:25
JOSEPH WOLPE You kept the image consistently and what was the anxiety level? 

00:38:30
TOM 20. 

00:38:35
JOSEPH WOLPE Was it 20 throughout? 

00:38:35
TOM It started at about 35 and went down to 20. 

00:38:40
JOSEPH WOLPE It went down to 20, all right. And what's your score right now? 

00:38:45
TOM 5 to 10. 

00:38:50
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, that's very good. So, we can now uh, more or less immediately uh, repeat this. And so, I'm going to ask you to get the image again and to say, okay. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:05
TOM Okay. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:10
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened this time? 

00:39:25
TOM No anxiety at all. 

00:39:25
JOSEPH WOLPE No anxiety at all, that's really excellent. Well, um what I will now do is to go on to uh, working with the image of the man that you shot. 

00:39:40
TOM Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
JOSEPH WOLPE And um. So, I'd, I'd like you to get that image. And I'll wait for you to say, okay. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
TOM Okay. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:15
JOSEPH WOLPE What happened? 

00:40:15
TOM I had difficulty following the pen. 

00:40:15
JOSEPH WOLPE You had difficulty following the pen? I think I was holding it a little closer than before. Uh, maybe that was it, I'm not sure. Anyway what happened to the image? 

00:40:25
TOM The image is still very clear. 

00:40:25
JOSEPH WOLPE And how much disturbance did it give you? 

00:40:30
TOM 80. 

00:40:35
JOSEPH WOLPE It was 80, throughout? 

00:40:35
TOM No, actually it started off a little lower and it got worse. 

00:40:40
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, so what's your score at this moment? 

00:40:45
TOM 60. 

00:40:45
JOSEPH WOLPE About 60. All right now try to calm yourself. 

00:40:50
TOM Okay. 

00:40:50
JOSEPH WOLPE And tell me when you feel calmer. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:40:55
TOM Okay. 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:05
JOSEPH WOLPE And what happened this time? 

00:41:25
TOM I could follow the pen this time and I get the image. And not as drastic as the last time. It's about 70, now. 

00:41:30
JOSEPH WOLPE It's about 70. 

00:41:30
TOM Yes. 

00:41:30
JOSEPH WOLPE I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll, we'll introduce some modification. Uh, I need to ask you a question. How far away do you imagine this person to be. 

00:41:45
TOM Uh, I know precisely he was 60 feet away. 

00:41:50
JOSEPH WOLPE He was 60 feet away. 

00:41:50
TOM Yes. 

00:41:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Uh, now, I tell you what I want you to do this time. I want you to imagine again that he's 60 feet away. But he is separated from you by a large sheet of plate glass. 

00:42:05
TOM Bullet, bullet proof. 

00:42:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Pardon? 

00:42:10
TOM Bullet proof glass? 

00:42:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Yes. 

00:42:10
TOM Okay. 

00:42:15
JOSEPH WOLPE So, tell me okay when you're ready. 

00:42:20
TOM Okay. 

00:42:25
[sil.] 

00:42:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Now what happened? 

00:42:25
TOM It's much lower, 30. 

00:42:40
JOSEPH WOLPE At about 30. Does it stay 30, throughout? 

00:42:45
TOM Yes. 

00:42:45
JOSEPH WOLPE It, it didn't go down at all. 

00:42:50
TOM Well, actually it did go down a little bit, it went a little bit lower but then it went back to 30. Because I'm trying to imagine the plausibility of standing behind the glass. 

00:43:00
JOSEPH WOLPE You see it as unrealistic to you to be separated by this uh, by this a bullet proof glass. 

00:43:05
TOM Yes. 

00:43:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, let's try another modification. Um, let's see, there's one point that I really don't have quite clear. Uh, when you have this image, do you have a gun in your hand? 

00:43:20
TOM Yes. 

00:43:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Let's see what happens if you have the image of the man 60 feet away and you don't have a gun in your hand. Well, just try that without anything. Is that, does that do anything to you? 

00:43:35
TOM Yeah, run. 

00:43:40
JOSEPH WOLPE Mmm? 

00:43:40
TOM I would run. 

00:43:40
JOSEPH WOLPE He doesn't have a gun either. 

00:43:45
TOM Oh, okay. There's no problem with that. 

00:43:50
JOSEPH WOLPE There's no problem. So that, so that the gun is absolutely crucial to the, to the image. 

00:43:55
TOM Yes. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:00
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, I'm going to do one more thing and then we'll decide where we go after that. Uh, I want now, to go back to the original image as, in the exact way that you imagine it. Uh, both people having guns but in actual the guns are not fired are they? 

00:44:25
TOM Mine is. 

00:44:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Your gun is fired. Oh, that's interesting. Now suppose your gun was not fired. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:35
TOM I don't know what to do with that. 

00:44:35
JOSEPH WOLPE You don't know what to do with that. Okay, we'll, we'll do it in a way in which you did it in the beginning. Say, okay when you get the image. 

00:44:55
TOM Okay. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:10
JOSEPH WOLPE Okay, what happened? 

00:45:10
TOM It's about 50, consistently. 

00:45:15
JOSEPH WOLPE So, it's 50 all the way. 

00:45:15
TOM Yes. 

00:45:15
JOSEPH WOLPE And that is down from what original 70 wasn't it. 

00:45:20
TOM Ah, I think it was higher than that originally. 

00:45:25
JOSEPH WOLPE What's your score now? 

00:45:25
TOM 10. 

00:45:30
JOSEPH WOLPE 10. All right. Well, I think we'll do it just once more. 

00:45:35
TOM Okay. 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:45
TOM Okay. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:50
JOSEPH WOLPE So? 

00:45:50
TOM Uh, On my own I took the gun away. From, I meant, I just imagined he didn't have it. 

00:46:05
JOSEPH WOLPE But did you shoot him anyway? 

00:46:05
TOM No. 

00:46:10
JOSEPH WOLPE All right, so you modified the image, and, and what happened to your anxiety? 

00:46:15
TOM It isn't there. 

00:46:15
JOSEPH WOLPE It isn't there, okay. We'll have to stop now. 

00:46:15
TOM Okay. 

00:46:15
JOSEPH WOLPE As far as this, only you stay here and I'm going to go back and sit in my chair. And um, I'm going to invite the audience to, to uh, ask you and me some questions. We'll have no more than five minutes of questions asking. Okay. You have to go, you have to go to a microphone I think. 

00:46:45
[sil.] 

00:46:45
JOSEPH WOLPE Is the microphone such a long distance? 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, it is. Uh, suppose it had been a, uh, non-visual idea like the sound of an explosion, something like that. Would you still focus on the eyes? 

00:47:20
JOSEPH WOLPE Yes, the purpose of the eye movement is uh, um, used to, to uh, um, to have its effects counterpoise the anxiety no matter what the source of the anxiety is. It's absolutely that way, parallel to systematic desensitization. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN So, it's a counter-stimulus basically. 

00:47:45
JOSEPH WOLPE I beg your pardon? 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN So, basically it's a counter stimulus. 

00:47:50
JOSEPH WOLPE It's a stimulus that's all. And a stimulus can be of any kind. 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Would it be useful in the next to last image you used if you had pause the idea that he knew that the man's gun was not loaded? 

00:48:05
JOSEPH WOLPE It's very difficult to hear without a microphone. Um, unless you come right up here and I'll repeat your question. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Would it have been useful in the next to last image to pause it for him the information that he knew that the gun was not loaded? 

00:48:25
JOSEPH WOLPE Well, there's all sorts of possibilities. He, he, has already modified the image and uh, you see we, we have already done a lot in this single session. We haven't totally uh, well immunize him to the images that disturb him. But we've done quite a lot. And he will need at least one more session may be two more sessions. Uh, uh, totally to combat the uh, the disturbing images. And uh, various inputs that he will provide plus, plus ideas the therapist may have uh, work can be used to change the image. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:49:15
JOSEPH WOLPE There are sort of trial by error feeling one's way involved here. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN When you did the background history, you asked about his first erotic feelings and um, and something about his sexual life early on when he was younger. Um, was that perhaps usable later in terms of a, a stimulus that was positive just the thoughts about sexuality and what they're related to. 

00:49:45
JOSEPH WOLPE You, you're suggesting that they're something to do with his sexual life may be, may be involved here. The only warrant I can see for that any way is the fact that he had been better since his second marriage. That, that uh, probably means there's been a, a degree of comfort with him that the marriage has produce um, and uh, the mere fact of sex is probably um, well, just instrumental. I, I don't think it has anything, I can see no way sex has anything to do with the causation of this uh, illness. Um, now, let's just ask him one question. You're sitting here now, Tom, and you've been through this, and uh, the, the, not that the disturbance of the images have gone down. My question to you now is, is there any difference in the general way you feel this moment compared to when we began? 

00:50:45
TOM Well, I'm optimistic that something can be done about it. 

00:50:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
TOM Because I saw how it worked. 

00:50:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Um, yes. But I'm, I'm just sort of asking you is there, this, this is a difficult question to answer. I'm really asking is there any sort of change or inner feeling? 

00:51:05
TOM Uh, more optimism is the feeling I have. 

00:51:05
JOSEPH WOLPE Mm-hmm. Yes, okay. Well, that's a very good feeling to have. Uh, well we have, we have five more minutes. Well, I don't think we can have any more questions because I just want to make some concluding remarks and um, what I want to say is that. This method was um, only discovered about two years ago. It has been uh, used by a small number of people. There is one psychologist, John Marquois(ph) in Palo Alto, whose treated a hundred uh, patients. They're not all post-traumatic stress disorder but they, they do include eight patients who had uh, uh, a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder following the San Francisco earthquake. And all of these eight over came their anxiety entirely in a single session. Uh, one of them was a woman who began to sort of have, have visualizations of earthquakes and she sort of re-sensitized herself and relapsed. And she was treated a second time and again over came her anxiety in one session. Um, it, it seems to be to be a major advance in, in psychiatry. It, it's very much in line with other things that are done in behavior therapy. It's essential uh, a uh, a new, an new plenty and particularly powerful uh, resource for inhibiting anxiety in such a way as to uh, over come anxiety uh, anxiety response habits. There is some research being done um, to try and find out how it works. Which is really not understood at all. There are various projects. Uh, the uh, some of these were put forth during the symposium at the, at the um, annual meeting for the Association for the Advance in Behavior Therapy last month in San Francisco. Uh, well I think that about sums it up. Except for me, I, I feel very encouraged about Tom and I feel pretty sure that in one or two more sessions uh, he, he will be able to accept this uh, very, you know, very dis-stressful image and uh, that uh, the complaints which are still plaguing his life will be overcome. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:50
JOSEPH WOLPE Tom, thank you very much. 

00:53:50
