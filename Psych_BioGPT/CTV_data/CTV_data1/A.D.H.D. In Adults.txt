NARRATOR The following program is presented by Guilford Publications. Please stay tuned at the conclusion for information on additional ADHD resources from Dr. Russell Barkley that are also available from Guilford Publications. 

00:00:15
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Millions of children in the United States have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a condition which affects their lives at school, at home and at play. 

00:00:25
has a problem paying attention 

00:00:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD has long been considered a behavioral disorder of childhood and many experts believe children grow out of it as they reach adulthood. 

00:00:35
ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER 

00:00:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY We now know that is not the case. 

00:00:45
ADHD IN ADULTS 

00:00:50
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY, PH.D. Director of Psychology Professor of Psychiatry U. Massachusetts Medical Ctr. Hello, I’m Dr. Russell Barkley. I’m the Director of Psychology and Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. Although ADHD is most often described as a disorder of childhood, it can and frequently does persist into the adult years in many affected individuals. Left untreated, adults who have the disorder often face additional problems beyond the core symptoms of ADHD, problems such as antisocial behavior, substance abuse, depression and occupational and interpersonal problems. In this program, we're going to describe the nature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults, discuss methods for making a diagnosis and present a number of treatment strategies that have been proven to be successful in helping adults cope with this troubling disorder. 

00:01:40
PEGGY What’re you going to do after school today when you come home? 

00:01:45
MICHAEL I'm gonna do homework. 

00:01:45
PEGGY Okay and who, who’s gonna help with your homework? 

00:01:50
MICHAEL You. 

00:01:55
PEGGY No, I'm gonna be at work. 

00:01:55
MICHAEL Dad. 

00:01:55
BRIAN No, I will be out. 

00:02:00
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:02:00
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Brian and Peggy are the parents of Michael, an 8-year-old recently diagnosed with ADHD. Getting Michael to do his school work is difficult, but Brian knows what the consequences can be because school was not Brian’s favorite place to be. 

00:02:15
BRIAN ADHD ADULT I missed quite a bit of school. I don’t you know a whole heck of a lot, but enough school where umm… I guess I really wished that I had a direction, a focus in life where someone did take me, okay then and say you’ve got to study, you’ve got to stay with school, okay. 

00:02:35
PAT Done your homework?. 

00:02:35
MICHAEL No. 

00:02:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Pat’s life, by her own admission, has been a chaotic, unstructured existence. 

00:02:45
PAT ADHD ADULT Just about anything that has a deadline on it is overwhelming to me. Time skips me and I’m unable ever to effectively manage that, so ah… it’s hard for me to plan and have umm… realistic goals and timetables. 

00:03:00
STEVE And then I filed a motion for ex-party hearing to restore his license. 

00:03:10
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Steve struggled with academics his entire life. Although he managed to complete law school, his ADHD-related problems continue to affect his work. 

00:03:20
STEVE ADHD ADULT I just had to put in more time. I had to spend probably ten times more time than the average person did, so that if I had a couple of cases on a Monday morning, which would be normal, I would be in here Saturday and Sunday planning out what I had to do. 

00:03:40
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY These three adults represent thousands if not millions of other whose ADHD was never diagnosed early in life, but Brian, Pat and Steve are more fortunate than most. The source of their difficulties as children and as adults finally has been identified. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by a significant inability to sustain attention and effort by highly impulsive behavior and by an inappropriate level of activity. 

00:04:20
STEVE Hi Julie these all done now? 

00:04:20
JULIE Well sir. 

00:04:20
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Individuals with ADHD had considerable trouble in school as children and at work as adults and in managing the daily responsibilities of life. 

00:04:30
PAT Bye Ritchie. 

00:04:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD in adulthood can have a negative impact on relationships, careers, and self esteem. Once recognized and treated however, many adults with ADHD like Brian, Pat and Steve can learn to cope with this difficult disorder. 

00:04:50
BRIAN As far as my direction in life didn’t happen till 15 to 16 years when I met Peggy that was the turning point in my life. Thank god for Peggy’s patience and understanding to talk, okay and for me it made my life very easy because I can to talk to her about anything and everything. 

00:05:05
PAT It was fearful. I know that the article in the paper. I have a lifetime ideas that never developed. Now I have half of a lifetime left, which I want to see those ideas fully developed and carried out and I think I have the tools there now. It’s not that it’s easier, but I do have the tools. 

00:05:25
WHAT IS ADHD? 

00:05:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY It is not uncommon for anyone to occasionally have trouble paying attention, controlling their impulses or feeling overactive, but in people with ADHD, these problems occur far more frequently and often have serious consequences. 

00:05:50
PEGGY Should we start getting ready for school? 

00:05:50
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:05:50
PEGGY Alright. 

00:05:50
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY When Michael began having behavior problems in kindergarten, Brian began to see the similarities with his own childhood. What he remembers most vividly were his difficulties in school. 

00:06:05
BRIAN You stereotype yourself as being stupid. It is very easy to do that because you find if you do fall behind a class, okay, because you are distracted as other things, umm… a pencil drops, all your concentration’s gone and you’re off on something else and it’s hard to get into, getting back into it, like I said, in sense staying focused on what is going on. Like I said, school was not my favorite place to be. 

00:06:30
BRIAN (inaudible ) now?. 

00:06:35
MICHAEL Probably. 

00:06:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY As a result, Brian didn’t spend too much time in the classroom. Rather, he spent a lot of time on the streets. 

00:06:40
BRIAN I went through numerous grammar schools due to the fact that I was just labeled with disciple problem. I associated with maybe a dozen friends. We, they could call it a gang today, but we were just a dozen friends that we would get together and play ball and stuff like that then. And the friends that I had then, of the dozen, we had a, a reunion about maybe three or four maybe five years ago now and out of the twelve kids that I did hang around with, not constantly but our friends, umm… eight were in jail and four of us seem to have made something of our lives. 

00:07:15
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Steve’s difficulties developed into a severe lack of self-esteem. I believe that didn’t end until he found out what was causing his problems. 

00:07:25
STEVE When I was very young, pretty sure I was very hyperactive. They just thought you’re just being a kid. As I got older, they thought I was stupid and dumb. I always knew there was something the matter with me, I mean because I always had to act differently than most of my friends did in order to get through college and law school. 

00:07:50
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Like many people with ADHD, Steve not only had academic problems, but interpersonal ones as well. 

00:07:55
STEVE I couldn’t maintain relationships. I'm always different. You know, I had, I had, I was moody at times. Umm… it, it took a lot out of you to have to study for an exam. I mean it wasn’t, wasn’t pleasant. I mean, if I really try to apply myself, it just took a lot out of you. It just drained you mentally. 

00:08:20
PAT There it is, come here Sam can you reach at that part, can you see where he is? 

00:08:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Pat also experienced serious problems with school, problems which persisted into her adult years. 

00:08:30
PAT I can remember third grade, my mother going in, the comments to the teachers were "just keep her busy." I had a real time staying in school. I had, even though, I, I, you know, I could pass and I was articulate and stuff, I could never pass English and things like this, but I liked going off and looking, you know, catching butterflies, doing that kind of thing is always enjoyable. And then as an adult that many of the things that I felt I was capable of doing, I, I was in fact umm… not umm… not getting the whole thing done. 

00:09:05
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Pat’s son Ritchie also has ADHD although it may be difficult to tell from the way he perseveres at this computer game. 

00:09:15
RITCHIE Ah… man. 

00:09:15
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Because the rules are simple and the reward is immediate, activities like computer games or catching butterflies can hold the attention of people with ADHD longer than one might expect. More telling of the disorder however, is the inability to sustain attention in activities that don’t have such immediate results, activities like managing the daily responsibilities of life. 

00:09:40
PAT Okay, one side is organized. The other side is, this is the truer part of the inner person who exists within this framework here. Well, I think I came up by, I had some books and then I was going to take something, so I get the map(ph) in. I was gonna hand something and my husband needed to get to the plumbing in the closet, so I had to pull the closet out and I never managed to get any of it back together. So, I can tell you who’s gonna be a chair(ph) at meet tonight. I think it’s, oh yeah, Dr. Heller(ph) who is gonna be up there this evening on adult ADHD issues, which I really should go and see because that might help me in the structure that I have all my paperwork here for my son’s schooling, kind of organized in this stack and I haven’t been sewing for a few years, but I’ve got all my fabric around here. I haven’t had time for that. I’ve been trying to get to my exercise bike, oh. 

00:10:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY For most people with ADHD, life is much like Pat’s room, poorly organized and highly random, but Pat like Steve and Brian, feels a sense of relief that the source of her problems has finally been identified. 

00:10:45
PAT Yeah, I feel better now. The diagnosis means, you know, you can manage something or you can’t, but you’re gonna acknowledge something here. It’s, it's, it's not as shapeless. 

00:10:55
STEVE It was sort of like a relief when I found out about it because then I confirmed, you know, my suspicions and then I knew what the problem was. 

00:11:10
PEGGY I couldn’t believe with some of the things that he had done. How could someone go through six different elementary schools? umm… so that’s when I, when it all came together. I thought "wow," you know, there was a reason for this behavior. There is a reason. 

00:11:30
WHAT CAUSES ADHD? 

00:11:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY For more than a hundred years, scientists have been trying to determine what causes the variety of symptoms that are typical of ADHD. Fortunately, we now know more about the origin of the disorder and with a greater degree of certainty than ever before. 

00:11:50
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD seems to be the result of a neurological defect in the areas of the brain where the ability to control impulses, delay gratification, and focus attention are located. Recent studies measuring blood flow in the brains of people with ADHD have found a reduced flow to these areas, but ADHD is not caused by diminished blood flow. Rather, it is a lower level of brain activity in these areas, which results in less blood being needed. Other scientists have also shown that people with ADHD display less electrical activity in these regions of the brain. 

00:12:30
DR. ALAN J. ZAMETKIN Okay, just close your eyes. 

00:12:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY But perhaps the most dramatic evidence that ADHD is a neurological problem comes from a recent study by Dr. Alan Zametkin and his colleagues at The National Institute of Mental Health. 

00:12:40
DR. ALAN J. ZAMETKIN Earphone’s on and in a few minutes you’ll be hearing some tones and when you hear… 

00:12:45
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY The study measured the brain activity of adults with ADHD using a PET scan. In these exams, a radioactive contrast dye is first injected. Then, the person is asked to respond to a series of audio tones by pressing a button. This requires focusing attention on the tasks of listening and pressing the button. 

00:13:10
DR. ALAN J. ZAMETKIN We’re all done with that part now Mrs. Coblin I’ll take your earphones off and I'm gonna take your eye pads off and then we’ll go ahead and take some pictures of your brain metabolism. There you go… 

00:13:20
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY The PET scan records images of the brain including the areas known to be associated with attention. Dr. Zametkin explains the value of this technique. 

00:13:30
ALAN J. ZAMETKIN, MD National Inst. of Mental Health We have known for years that particular parts of the brain are involved in attention and motor control. For example, the frontal lobes that are up here are areas that have been known for many years to be involved in attention as opposed to the posterior frontal areas and motor cortex over here that's important for motor control and fine movement. The areas of red are areas of high metabolism where the brain is working very hard to pay attention to the tones whereas the areas of blue and purple are areas of much lower metabolism and by knowing where to look, where in fact attention is located in brain metabolism, then we can look at particular patient groups to see whether or not the patient groups can activate that part of the brain important(ph) for attention. 

00:14:20
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Dr. Zametkin's study showed that people with ADHD when compared to people who do not have the disorder, demonstrate reduced metabolic activity in the areas of the brain where attention, impulsivity and motor control are managed. This study strongly indicates that the symptoms associated with ADHD are in fact neurological in origin. 

00:14:45
LIVING WITH ADHD 

00:14:50
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD is a psychological disorder, which has many behavioral manifestations. These behaviors can have a significant impact on a person’s self-esteem as well as his or her interpersonal relationships. 

00:15:00
PAT Well, we’ve been running late, let’s go. All of their life is on a schedule. I cannot master it, you know, trying to get him out, trying to get him in school, trying to get these things. You know, I never do anything the same way. I innately like that structure. He innately likes that structure. It’s very, very hard because there is so many things that this just have to be done They're catching a rhubarb. 

00:15:25
RITCHIE What? 

00:15:25
PAT Catching a rhubarb. Yeah, that’s how it will function. You realize that this thing that your child is experiencing and you are supposed to be setting up all these charts the same things you need and there is a tremendous resistance. I mean I never had a watch, I never had a calendar, I never had any of those things, which are natural tools to get through things so. For us, my husband bought me this one a year ago or so, a wonderful calendar with that first time I knew next week what I was gonna do and I in fact did it because I was reminded that… that were block at that time. Umm… you know, I'm always surprised it’s spring. I’m always surprised it’s Monday. 

00:16:05
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY As Pat indicated, her ADHD is something that not only impacts her relationship with her son Ritchie, but with her husband as well. 

00:16:15
PAT Marriage is not fair I just thought. You know what I mean, I think he has an extra burden of trying to make this kind of thing manageable with getting Ritchie to comply and respond to schedule and also me on top of that and we are a destructive force. Both of us are really formidable in terms of losing that schedule, losing that, you know, we bring chaos wherever we travel. You know, we had a cat, we got rid of that, it was one more ADD individual as far as my husband was concerned. 

00:16:45
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD also had an impact on Brian and Peggy’s relationship, but like Pat, they were able to work through it over time. 

00:16:55
BRIAN We discussed everything from then and that’s how we really became ah… to really know each other was to discuss it and talk about everything ah… in our lives and it made my life a very, actually it wasn’t so easy, but it made my life very nice. 

00:17:10
PEGGY What does dad do? 

00:17:15
MICHAEL Work. 

00:17:15
PEGGY Work and what else does he do? What happens when you don’t do your homework? What’s dad gonna say it to you today? 

00:17:20
PEGGY Brian is very verbal, you know, he doesn’t hold much back, which was very hard for me in the beginning. You know, he will say his piece to anybody, to anything. I think I’m a little more reserved. Umm… and I think you find this with people that have attention deficit. They are very verbal umm… 

00:17:45
BRIAN Right or wrong. 

00:17:45
PEGGY Right or wrong, that’s right whether they feel, whatever they do, they’re going to say it and that’s it. See with Michael, umm… so when we were first married, you know, Brian would be saying his piece, you know and I’d be going "wow," you know, "did you have to say, did you have to say that?" And it was after like a he has had a period of understanding umm… and I think that’s what you have to do and I think the key to a very good relationship with or without attention deficit is number one, communication. Number two, we’re very good friends and I think that’s important. I think that’s why we’ll able to help Michael through. We work together. 

00:18:35
BRIAN He was pretty, he was pretty. 

00:18:35
STEVE Hello. 

00:18:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY People with ADHD often have difficulties in their relationships with others. 

00:18:40
STEVE I wanna to get together with you… 

00:18:45
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This is because they say and do things on impulse, which may offend, hurt, or drive others away and they often do not follow through on their promises. These social problems may lead them to develop poor self-images. 

00:19:00
STEVE It was like all of my life I was putting myself down because I was, I thought I was stupid or I didn’t get things the first time around, but now I know what the problem is. You know, like I’d have to read something and I’d say five minutes later "what did I read?" and I can’t remember what I read. 

00:19:15
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Steve finally did complete law school, but it took a great deal of effort, an effort he has to make everyday just to keep up in his profession. 

00:19:25
STEVE Everything is still difficult. I take my notes and I started to work harder and longer, but now I understand what the problem is and it does mean that I’m dumb and I can take a certain amount of satisfaction that I went through college and all that, but I know what the problem is and that’s why I am thankful for. 

00:19:45
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY As you have seen and heard, ADHD individuals experience a wide range of difficulties in their working and social environments, problems that are sometimes difficult for others to comprehend. 

00:20:00
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Recently, I developed a new theory about ADHD, which I think helps to better explain the nature and types of problems people with ADHD experience in their daily lives. This theory states that people with ADHD are likely to have problems with four important mental abilities because they cannot inhibit their initial response to a situation. 

00:20:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY People with ADHD have difficulty with hindsight and forethought. They have problems separating the emotional aspects of a situation from the informational content. They are less able to use internal language or thoughts to guide their behaviors. And they have difficulty analyzing problem situations and breaking them down into component parts. As a result, they are not able to recombine them to come up with more creative solutions to these problems. The inability to use these cognitive processes prevents a person with ADHD from withholding a reaction to a given situation. In other words, there was little or no delay between an event and their response to it. 

00:21:10
RELATED PROBLEMS 

00:21:10
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Individuals with ADHD have a higher risk of having a number of other difficulties beyond the core symptoms. Approximately 25% display a persistent pattern of antisocial behavior. Between 12% and 30% are likely to have a substance abuse disorder involving alcohol or drugs. 

00:21:30
EMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS 

00:21:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY While ADHD adults are often employed fulltime They are likely to have lower job status than others. Change jobs more often Are less likely to get along with co-workers. And are more likely to quit their jobs or to be laid off. Many people with ADHD continue to have symptoms of their disorder into adulthood, but it is quite possible to make a satisfactory adult adjustment. The first step is to obtain an accurate diagnosis. 

00:22:00
DIAGNOSING ADHD IN ADULTS 

00:22:05
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY How is ADHD diagnosed in adults? Initially, many adults will report symptoms often after their own children have been diagnosed with the disorder. Follow-up interviews with family members may reveal further evidence of ADHD. Finally, this anecdotal information can be supplemented with a series of psychological tests. At the University of Massachusetts Medical Center Adult ADHD Clinic, a specific protocol has been developed to help determine if a person has the disorder. Dr. Kevin Murphy is the Clinic Director. 

00:22:40
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Okay John, I would like to start by just giving you kinda of a quick game plan about what we’re going to be doing this afternoon. 

00:22:45
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:22:45
DR. KEVIN MURPHY And basically what we’re gonna be doing is a lot of talking. You know, I’m gonna ask you lots of questions about your past and present functioning in different areas of your life, alright. That’s gonna be followed up with ah… some testing, which is relatively brief and following the testing we will then have a feedback session where I will discuss my impressions with you diagnostically… 

00:23:10
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:23:10
DR. KEVIN MURPHY …whether or not I think you have attention deficit disorder or not and why, umm… any coexisting problems you might have. 

00:23:15
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY While there are established procedures for evaluating children, diagnosing adults requires different methods. 

00:23:25
KEVIN MURPHY, PH.D. Director, Adult ADHD Clinic U. Massachusetts Medical Center I think it’s important to realize that for clinicians who might be trying to determine whether or not ADHD is the proper diagnosis. It’s something that manifests itself from early on. Okay, this is not a disorder that has an adult onset. We have to try to establish the existence of the ah… symptoms of this disorder technically before age 7 and of course, that’s easier said than done. 

00:23:45
DR. KEVIN MURPHY What are some of the symptoms that you’ve had that make you think you might have attention deficit disorder? 

00:23:50
JOHN I’ve noticed definite inability to concentrate for longer periods of time, very short time, I can do it. I’ve had to struggle very definitely at finishing things. 

00:24:05
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Hmm…hmm. 

00:24:05
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY John recently came to the clinic complaining of ADHD-like symptoms. 

00:24:10
JOHN I want to run to starting a new project or starting something different and then it loses its interest… 

00:24:15
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Hmm…hmm. 

00:24:15
JOHN …and then I go on to something else. 

00:24:15
DR. KEVIN MURPHY So it’s kinda sidetracked, little bit… 

00:24:20
JOHN Easily side, easily sidetracked. 

00:24:20
DR. KEVIN MURPHY It’s not an exact science, umm… and it’s not as much of a science as it’s with children where we do have better assessment umm… instruments that have established norms and percentiles and that kind of a thing. So with adults, what we generally do is three different, three different things. We have rating scales and questionnaires that we send out the adult patient asking them to fill out questionnaires based on the core symptoms of the disorder, their umm… work history, their school history. We ask also the patient’s spouse to fill out some questionnaires to get their perspective on the symptoms and the behaviors of the adult and if the parent of the patient is available, one of the parents or both, we also send questionnaires and rating scales to them, so ideally we have paper and pencil questionnaire kinds of rating scales from three different sources, patient, spouse and the parent. That’s important to get multiple sources of information. Then, we bring the patient into the clinic and do about a three-hour evaluation, both for the ADHD type of symptoms and coexisting problems that are often associated with ADHD. In any other ways that's manifesting itself in your, in your social life or your family life? 

00:25:35
JOHN Well, there’s always been a feeling of, you know, what’s wrong with me… 

00:25:35
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Hmm…hmm. 

00:25:40
JOHN I can’t concentrate. You know, you go to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist and you work on certain emotions… 

00:25:45
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Hmm…hmm. 

00:25:45
JOHN But it’s still there. I have the feeling. 

00:25:50
DR. KEVIN MURPHY We look more in depth at school history and work history, and psychological history, past psychiatric functioning history, medication history, those kinds of things and then we do some testing in the clinic. Alright John, this is a test. I talked about it earlier. It measures your ability to pay attention. 

00:26:05
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:26:05
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Okay. What I’m gonna do, it’s gonna, it’s gonna flash basically two pictures on the screen. One of them is a target stimuli and one is a non-target stimuli. Basically, the goal for you is when you see the target stimuli. 

00:26:20
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:26:20
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Alright, as soon as you see it, I want you to press this clipper right here, this little button as fast as you can. 

00:26:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY There are tests for evaluation attention skills. This is the test of variables of attention or TOVA. The person watches the computer screen and responds to a target image. In this case, a yellow square with a smaller black square in the upper half. Other tests are used to measure intellectual ability or to screen for any coexisting conditions such as learning disabilities. All this data is then compiled and evaluated to determine if the person meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. 

00:27:00
DR. KEVIN MURPHY And then we do the feedback session where we try to begin the process of education with the patient and let them know if we think they have the disorder, why we think they have the disorder, give them a rationale for why we are diagnosing them with that. Then, we spend a few minutes telling them what attention deficit disorder is. 

00:27:20
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Alright John, now I’m ready to kinda of give you the feedback. You’ve been through a lot this afternoon. 

00:27:25
JOHN Okay. 

00:27:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY I wanna kinda of put it all together and… 

00:27:25
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:27:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY …give you my impressions about what I’m thinking. Okay? The way I do this, I first talk diagnostically about what I think is going on diagnostically, then I’ll follow it up with some specific recommendations, which I think might be helpful for you Okay. 

00:27:35
JOHN Okay. 

00:27:40
DR. KEVIN MURPHY First of all, umm… as to the question of whether or not you have ADHD, I clearly think that you do, that you do meet criteria for attention deficit disorder and the reason that I say that is the following, these are a few reasons. Number one is you’ve endorsed many of the core symptoms of this, of the disorder… 

00:27:55
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:27:55
DR. KEVIN MURPHY Okay, talking about the distractibility that you told me about, the inability to focus and concentrate, then going from one thing to another, the hyperactivity that you had, you know, when you were younger and a lot of the core symptoms like that we talked about… 

00:28:10
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:28:10
DR. KEVIN MURPHY …earlier are have clearly been there. Ah… the second reason that I think you have the disorder is that we’ve established like an early onset alright. This is… 

00:28:15
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:28:20
DR. KEVIN MURPHY …ADHD in adults by definition is something that doesn’t have an onset in adulthood and… 

00:28:25
JOHN Okay. 

00:28:25
DR. KEVIN MURPHY …though you’ve asked or I asked you the question about when these symptoms began for you and you pretty much told me that they’ve been there from the beginning. 

00:28:30
JOHN Hmm…hmm. 

00:28:30
DR. KEVIN MURPHY And that’s one of the criteria we have to try to establish, an early onset in order to get the diagnosis as an adult. So clearly this thing has been going on from a get goal for you. 

00:28:40
JOHN Okay. 

00:28:40
DR. KEVIN MURPHY …quite early on and the other reason that I think you have ADHD is that there is no other, you don’t seem to have any other coexisting or competing condition that would account for the symptoms of ADHD. They often has felt that they’re just inadequate, inept, dumb, lazy, unmotivated, stupid people sometimes and those are the messages they’ve gotten across their lives, which has been very unfortunate and we look at this and we try to tell them that this is not a disorder or bad character or bad parenting or laziness or stupidity. It’s a neurological condition and part of the problem they’ve had all of their lives are not their fault and that there is treatment for this and that we can help them to cope with the symptoms. That idea of empowering them to believe that, if they want to work hard at this, that they can make the difference in their lives and turn their lives around, you know in many cases that is very true. 

00:29:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY It is important to point out that there are a number of conditions, which may emulate ADHD in adults and which must be ruled out before definitive diagnosis of ADHD can be made. These include manic depression, borderline personality disorder and psychosis or schizophrenia. In addition, there are other disorders, which may present along with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and which must be addressed as well. These include antisocial personality disorder, substance abuse, depression, learning disabilities and anxiety disorders. 

00:30:15
TREATING ADHD ADULTS 

00:30:20
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Because the symptoms of ADHD are so diverse and persistent, a number of treatments are used to help manage the disorder. 

00:30:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY These are medication, education and counseling. Keep in mind, these treatments should be used in combination over long periods of time to be most effective. 

00:30:35
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY There are several types of medications, which have been prescribed to treat ADHD symptoms stimulants, certain antidepressants and the antihypertensive drug Clonidine. Of these, stimulants are the preferred choice. The most commonly prescribed stimulants are Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Cylert. Stimulants are fast acting, producing effects within 30 to 45 minutes and peaking within two to four hours. Because the effects quickly dissipate, they are taken two or three times a day. Stimulants improve attention, reduce impulsive behavior and control excessive activity. But the effects of stimulants are highly individual with people experiencing different responses with varying doses. In addition to medications, there are several other important interventions, which are used in the treatment of adults with ADHD. These include psycho-educational counseling to inform the person about the nature and causes of ADHD. Vocational assessments and guidance are used to match personal skills with work requirements. Teaching skills such as organizational management and time management help the person compensate for their deficits. Support groups and individual therapy are employed to deal with negative feelings from childhood. And marital and family therapy may assist family members in coping with ADHD spouses and relatives, but perhaps the most effective treatment component is receiving the diagnosis itself. This often provides a powerful insight into years of failure and frustration as well as a dramatic sense of relief at finally knowing what has been wrong. 

00:32:20
DR. KEVIN MURPHY The lack of concentration. 

00:32:25
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY No one has yet found a true cure for ADHD, but educational and behavioral strategies combined with medication have enabled many people to compensate for the deficits caused by this disorder. For example, Steve is able to be more productive. 

00:32:45
STEVE I couldn’t do this before. I mean that I really wouldn’t have this patience to do this at this hour. I mean, I, I just can remember relatively, not frustrated after being up and just constantly working and doing this reading and stuff like that. I still get up at 4 o'clock in the morning. I stopped feeling the time and whereas maybe umm… maybe you could read something and get it the first time around, I can’t do that, but I was always down on myself. The difference was people were telling me I was stupid and I was telling myself that I was stupid. Now I don’t do that anymore. 

00:33:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Pat is better able to understand and help her son, Ritchie. 

00:33:35
PAT Ritchie has attention deficit disorder. He is hyperactive. He also has learning disabilities, but he also has a sense(ph) of that also who he is and it is simply something he has to work with. Today is the ah… peace day, right, no violence, no pushing, no kicking. We had been able to really work with his issues of self-esteem and learning how to face and praise and give him real umm… small successes that wouldn’t be there otherwise. So, what it meant for him and what it means for us is learning what we need to learn, umm… responding to those kinds of things because it is a different approach indeed to what will make him a healthy umm… adult. It also meant whatever I believed in was possible for my child I could also believe was possible for me, which means I can do it. 

00:34:30
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY And after 15 years, Brian has nearly completed renovations on his house. 

00:34:35
BRIAN It was a nursing home and it was neglected. There hadn’t been any work done for 15 to 17 years on the house. Ah… this building here (inaudible ) was condemned, so we decided to start on this first so we can make a workshop out of it. It took about a year, a year and a half to get to where we could actually make it presentable and after that, there we started working on the main house and with the main house there was so much rot and deterioration over the years, we had to tear everything down. Staying busy with hands is probably what was really helping out a lot. I have learned in doing it to take each job as a job in itself and trying… instead of trying to look at the overall picture, the big picture, and say you know "I’ll never be finished with it." I kind of conclude that I’ll never be finished with it. A maintenance man would be nice instead of a contractor, but each job in itself and that’s where I guess I got my direction and focus with a lot of help from Peggy in saying "let’s stop one thing and try to finish one thing." What I am doing now, I’m just trying to get into a point where in life where I can really start something and finish it completely. 

00:35:40
DR. KEVIN MURPHY These patients have often come in feeling very defeated, very negative and we can turn that process around by giving them a framework to view this from. If we can light that fire and open up that world to them saying you know "there is hope" and with the proper treatment in terms of education, medication, behavioral kinds of strategies and hard work and support system and manipulating the environment around them, matching them to a good job, talking about how they can manage their organizational problems and their lack of structure, trying to increase those kinds of things in their lives, you can really make a significant impact on their day-to-day functioning. 

00:36:20
DR. RUSSELL A. BARKLEY ADHD is a psychological disorder, which has many behavioral manifestations, but the most important aspect of ADHD in adults is that it be recognized as a real disorder. With an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment, it is very possible for adults with ADHD to lead successful and fulfilling lives.
