Worries and Challenges 

00:06:40
ADELINE Cuz sometimes she just cries when, when she misses my daddy. Ah, one day when I just woke up in the morning my mom just missing my dad so that's why she was crying. 

00:06:55
ALEX My biggest challenge was probably just being very lonely you know. I'm used to having him right there bullying me and you know, like go-- I-- when I'm lonely I just go into his room you know, play his Xbox cuz he was a really big gamer so. It helps because he was there one day and then he just gone and then he was you know, which is nice a bit I know. Some of my worries were that they would never take it off the news like they were-- like the news people just wanted attention so they will make up a lie and say I-- because he wasn't wearing a helmet or something, something but you know, he wouldn't have died anyways. We were just really shocked because how people can just be so crude after someone died. I used to be really afraid of dying but now I'm not. 

00:07:50
AURORA Uhm, some of the hardest things, uhm, where-- where I'm going to see on my uncle's instruments and saying what to sell and what to keep. I, I felt sad. I was worrying about, uhm, how my, how my mom, my sister, my dad felt. 

00:08:05
DOMINIC One of my worries were-- I thought I wouldn't get anymore clothes because she went shopping for me. 

00:08:15
PHOEBE So the most hardest times of having daddy die is having to deal with Julia cuz she had big meltdowns. Julia is my sister. I normally he just-- for I did stay out of the fight. I'm worried about that I wouldn't have that much more fun without him. 

00:08:45
AMBA It's been hard to sleep because I enjoy sleep sometimes with my dad. 

00:08:50
JALEZA So my biggest challenge-- challenges were try not to be sad in front of my friends. Some of the things that have been hard for me school and that. Some of my worries were never see him again and never hear his voice again. I never feel how he touching and he will never to take me in places anymore like he did. He always played with me all the time. 

00:09:20
SAM The biggest challenges that I've had since he died was probably working like doing things outside like watering the garden. Ah, my mom does some of the work inside like, uhm, washing the dishes and like cleaning and stuff but I go-- uhm, no one who goes outside and like waters the trees. I've had to do things on my own a lot more now but my mom is there. Some of the fears I had when my dad died was, uhm, that I'd never see him again and like never play with him ever again. He was pretty much the only person and like the three of us, uhm, who would play with me outside and, yeah. 

00:10:10
ALEX The thing I miss most about my brother is not I've-- I was never really lonely you know, if I was stock at on a video game he could help me cuz he was like the master of video games, he's really good. He was one of those kids that just go into his room then I'd only see him at dinner time but you know, I hang with him more. 

00:10:30
AURORA I miss ma-- I miss most about my uncle, uhm, when he was over here to sort play his guitar until we went to sleep. He taught me how to play a violin and, uhm, taught me how to play the guitar too. I still sometimes play violin and, and but I play-- I practice a guitar a bunch. 

00:10:50
DOMINIC Uhm, she helped me with my homework. And I miss mom making pancakes some more. 

00:11:00
PHOEBE What I miss most is having him around. 

00:11:05
AMBA I miss about my dad is wrestling with him. The other things I do with my dad is-- that I did with my dad was soccer and wrestling. 

00:11:20
JALEZA What I miss most about him is just being him, jollying awesome. 

00:11:30
JULIA What I miss most about him is having him around and stuff cuz I used to have him around like when he got back from work and in the morning and now he was not there. It was kind, it's nice to have him and having take us to school and stuff. Something I like to do with my dad was, uhm, like go to downtown, stop to the library cuz he'd like bringing us stay on stuff and getting books with us. I also like to getting hotdogs sometimes.

00:13:00

00:13:10
What Has Helped 

00:13:15
ADELINE I really like to go away at the park on sunny days and I love to go to the pool and bounce enough the walls. I just go better with my scarf and then I just go watch a movie with my mom sometime. 

00:13:30
ALEX His cat Bobo has helped me a lot from comforting me and just letting me know he's be-- he's all right. He just knows you know, yoo-- I ask him, "Bobo, do you see Florst?" He's looks at you. Friends that have helped me they've all lost someone in their family. My best friend he's lost an older brother. They don't really say much because they don't know what to say so they-- they're just there for you, you know, you can cry and they won't call you something you know. 

00:14:00
AURORA Something that, uhm, helped me goes through it when gets through with the hard times is, uhm, my, my sister and my dad and mo-- and my mom just sat, sat in the room and talk to me. And sometimes it just helps me to be, uhm, to be left alone. I just, just, uhm, tal-- talking myself and then sometimes taking nap. 

00:14:20
DOMINIC What helps me is when I'm sa-- when I was sad is going to sleep. It just helps I guess. Uhm, it helps kids to play a video games when they're sad because it takes them and all our sad and it makes you have fun. 

00:14:40
PHOEBE Memories of my dad have helped get to the hard times. Daddy playing with me. Julia playing with him and part-- and pretending to his baby and parting he accepts and then say well. 

00:14:55
AMBA It's helped me to me looking at pictures of my dad. I have a picture of my bedroom-- in my bedroom of my dad and, ah, it's like him sleeping in his bed. When I look at the picture it makes me feel, ah, happy. 

00:15:15
JALEZA Some things helped me get through the hard times like reading a book called I Miss You and, and going to Camp Sunrise and get through it. Other things that have helped me is-- it was my friends saying, "I'm sorry for the loss..." and, and they know how I feel I because that even me lost a parent, grandparent. They just be as nice as they can and just make me smile a lot. 

00:15:45
JULIA Something I did to help was I like-- my puppy he was cheering me, make me feel good. So I would pet him and stuff and he'd help me feel better. I don't know I just like being with him and stuff. And I would talk to my puppy about how I felt and stuff and I also just like how fussy his fall was cuz he's really fluffy. 

00:16:10
SEQUOIA Uhm, things that helped me through the whole time, ah, was friends, family, and, ah, some, uhm, my some my stuffed animals helped me through it. My friends really helped me especially my friend Stefanie, my BFF. She talked, talked to me and she asked me what's bothering me and she just helped me so much. I'll, ah, she is my best friend, I love her so much. 

00:16:40
SAM Uhm, what's helped got-- get through the hard times, uhm, are my friends mostly and family. Family is the biggest thing cuz they know what I'm going through. They've just been there for me and, uhm, all the time. 

00:17:05
[music] 

00:17:15
Advice 

00:17:20
ALEX The advice I would give is don't keep it and you need to talk to sometime cuz it will just keep building. You get frustrated if you keep holding it in, you get angry and you're suppose to let stuff flow, you're not suppose to hold it in and build that all up. I would like people to know that you can be happy one day and just have someone in your life but you got to remember they can be gone in an instant. 

00:17:45
AURORA Talk to your parents about, about it, uhm, or anytime-- any relative, your siblings and they can help you, uhm, feel better. If kids don't talk, talk to, talk to anybody they-- they'll be, uhm, just left to moment-- keep growing and being sad. It's sad, it's okay to cry and you're not alone. 

00:18:05
PHOEBE Well, it's sort of really sad and, and it gets sort of hard to control your sadness. You try not to cry but you do try-- cry. It is okay to cry because it helps to get your sadness out of you. 

00:18:25
AMBA I'll taught kids to talk to their mom, it might help you like understand how he died. When people talk it makes things go better. 

00:18:40
JALEZA Uhm, I would tell them, "Don't worry just be happy all the away, you'll usually very well when you had that parent or grandparent." And just be missing, just be yourself. I want them to know that it's okay and don't worry you'll see them when you go there. 

00:19:05
JULIA Advice I would give is to think about good times you've had with that-- them and also, uhm, to tell people how you feel and stuff and-- cuz that usually helps if you tell people about your fears or what you're sad about. And that it's okay to cry when you feel sad. What I'd like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes and that sometimes that you don't really think it would hurt a lot it will and unexpected times. 

00:19:45
SAM The advice I would give to kids who have lost a love one who's, uhm, that, ah, talking to people doesn't, uhm, hurt and it actually really helps. I think, ah, the reason don't-- uhm, people don't bring it up is because they're scared to mention it cuz they think I'm gonna like freak out and cry and, flip out and stuff. It would, it would help a lot if, uhm, friends and people actually really talked about it and give you support cuz it's really helpful. My teachers we're actually really like mean about it, they, they didn't give me a chance to like put pieces back together and that, that, yeah. And they like, uhm, like I would-- as soon as I got back to school they give me F right off the about and like my mom had to do something about that and, yeah, it was really hard cuz they didn't really understand or helped. And like right after that they just fo-- totally forgot or just didn't wanna mention it. They could have said like every once in a while like, "Are you all right?" Like, "How's it going?" And, that would have helped a lot. And our councilor, uhm, she, ah, he told me to my mom that he wear two face that, uhm, he would, uhm, check on me every once in a while and ask how I was doing and pull me into another room and talk, and talk about it and stuff. He, he never even like said anything at all. I wish she would have, uhm, given me more support. 

00:21:25
SEQUOIA My stuffed animals when I needed, uhm, someone to hug my mom, dad were busy. I just talked to them. You could actually think they are actually friends in real life. I think them, there's-- they're family and they are like my favorite stuffed animal is Lily, she's a Dalmatian with hearts. And, uhm, when I needed something, I asked her and she just, she just helped me through it. She is or, ah, a really awesome friend. What I want people to know is, is really hard but you'll get through it and I know you can. 

00:22:10
ALEX Don't come on to them like, "Ah, I know how it feels." The advice I would give when you're comforting someone going through grief is not just to come too strong, you know, they just had someone die. And it might be like a year after the person died, it still feels like a day. It's just happened. Along with the like therapist people I went to like a hospice, they're really nice. They helped a lot. 

00:22:35
AURORA Sometimes just talk to them and, and if they-- and if they don't wanna talk to you back you can just le-- leave them alone. And sometimes, uhm, I just go and lay down for a little bit. 

00:22:45
PHOEBE Comforting them. Patting their back saying it's all gonna be okay. And if it's a mom or dad they would kiss them or something. 

00:22:55
JALEZA The advice I would give people, uhm, saying I'm sorry. My mom and she helping me with my homework in math and she's just been a really good person in my life. We're gonna spread his ashes somewhere where we can when, when I want to. And we're gonna go to fields and we're gonna spread all these ashes and then my mom is gonna save-- when my mom's gonna grab a pinch of him and she's gonna buy me a locket cuz she's gonna put him in the locket and I'm always gonna hold it next to my heart. 

00:23:40
JULIA Some things that my friends and my class did to help is that, uhm, we had the whole class, uhm, make quotes and stuff and talk about it and it helped. And also, uhm, as soon when my friends have already had hold me and said they were sorry and stuff. 

00:24:05

00:24:10
Life After Death 

00:24:15
ADELINE And sometimes I dream about him and I some-- the one time I dreamed about my daddy with my mama and my grandma. He was on the bed with shoes and clothes on. And I wear my pajamas on the whole day. That's what I dream about. 

00:24:30
ALEX To a certain extent I still like-- I still feel like my brother's with me because I don't think keeping with me with us 24-seven, I mean who would wanna do that. If you can't see the person or talk to whom you know. 

00:24:45
AURORA Uhm, sometimes I fe-- I feel like my uncle still with me. Ah, sometimes it feels a little sad and overwhelming. 

00:24:55
DOMINIC Ah, I feel like my mom is with me because she's an angel. 

00:25:05
PHOEBE I feel like my dad still around me. It's like having us feel protecting you. But just makes you feel comfortable. Sometimes I sort of have dreams about daddy, they're about good-- we can see daddy's soul and he's staying on a couch and I hug him. 

00:25:25
AMBA It feels like my dada still with me. I feel ma-- I feel him cheering me at my soccer games. 

00:25:35
JALEZA It feels like he's still with me but he's somewhere closer than I think. He's always in my heart which as close, as close can be. 

00:25:55
JULIA I feel like my Dada's with me all, all the time. Then I feel, think good and stuff. 

00:26:05
SAM In my heart I feel he was-- he's in there, uhm, everyday with me. Uhm, when I feel as comfort as when I'm like going through something like in school like hard or I got a camp. It's hard and I think how and difficult I feel that he's in me and helping me out and... 

00:26:25
SEQUOIA It feels like he's with me all of the time. He feels like he's right there, right next to me. It feels like, it feels like he's everywhere I go even if he's gone. I just love him so. 

00:26:45
ADELINE Uhm, but they go to heaven. Uhm, they have to stay there forever and they ne-- and they're not hungry or thirsty. You know, he-- when we go to heaven he's just gonna be like alive. 

00:27:00
ALEX I think my brother is helping animals. We rescue a lot of animals. I don't really believe in hell you know, if you're bad you-- I think that everyone gets a-- like everyone gets to forgive because it's your body that's making the action like the spirit. So I think everyone goes somewhere happy. 

00:27:20
AURORA After people die I think that they ca-- that they can choose to, uhm, go back to, uhm, earth with, uhm, ah, uhm, like with hum-- human or, uhm, being animal or they also have the choice to just stay in heaven. 

00:27:40
DOMINIC After people die they go to heaven. I think when people die they turn into an angel and help God.

00:27:55
AMBA I don't really know what happens to people after they die. 

00:27:55
JULIA Oh, I think that when people die they couldn't just disappear cuz they were whole person. I think it there's-- I think that they did go to heaven. And people in heaven I think that they watch over their loved ones and stuff. 

00:28:15
SAM I think they go to, uhm, heaven and, ah, life is just a test. Uhm, they just chill out. And I had a dream once where, uhm, and my dad and my brother-- well, he's not dead but, uhm, like, ah, they were just like, ah, singing on the bleachers, yeah, at a baseball game playing cards. It's pretty awesome. 

00:28:40
SEQUOIA I think my grandpa is in heaven. I love him so much and he's a great man, yeah, he really is. Well, he loved to read the newspaper on his big comfy chair.
