DR ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit, and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, give their best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Humor is another time honing(ph) device to add flavor, lower stress, increase relaxation and generally smooth out difficult things. Indulge in humor regularly because it increases endorphins, relaxing the body and decrease in anxiety, pretty next(ph). Let’s practice together. Today’s practice is a diet of humor adds flavor to life. One, plan right now, to watch a hilarious short movie, two, read a funny book, three, watch a top funny video on YouTube, four, begin to practice Laughter Yoga. Whatever it is, find something funny, today, to practice. Just engage yourself in something, some kind of activity that’s humorous and just allow yourself to get into the flow, enjoy it. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you want to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
