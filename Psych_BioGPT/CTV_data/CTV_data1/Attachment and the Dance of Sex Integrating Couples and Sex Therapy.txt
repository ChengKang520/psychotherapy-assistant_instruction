00:00:20
SUSAN JOHNSON Hi, everybody. Umm… I'm not Ginger Rogers. Umm… And so umm… It's an honor to be here a love coming to the network uh… it is like a family. And umm… I somehow feel free when I come here to… I'm very passionate of what I do and very passionate about my work. And some how I realize when I come here, I feel free to just be passionate with all of you to umm… really tell you about my passion and how I feel about what I'm doing. So that is wonderful. In fact, I'm in attachment series, so really what I'm saying is that the network is some how safe havens secure base. And we all know that when we feel safe that's when we're most real and most creative. So if you just want to sort of veggie out and listen to bits of my talk today you're most welcome because I'm going to put the text of this talk up on my website for a couple of weeks, it will go up it about 10 o' clock. So, umm… it's going to be on Doctorsusanjohnson.com, so if you go often to your own revelry, I'm going to show you piece of tangle, if you go often to your tangle fantasies, it's okay, you can go and look at the website and read the text. So, I'm going to talk to you about umm… sex, a couple of small topics. Sex and love and how to put the two of them together. So, we should be able to do that in about 55, 60 minutes here. But, because it's such a big topic I thought where on earth am I gonna start. So, the obvious thing and every women in the, in the audience will relate to this I think the obvious thing is to start with my mother.

SUSAN JOHNSON My little English working class mom, who calls sex a funny five minutes, didn't approve of girls going to university, not at all. She thought it was waste of time. So when I came home at the end of the second term, we had a big fight. And she pointed at me one point accusingly and she bell out, she said, "You think I don't what you're doing at that university, you think I don't But I know what you do, you have orgy's, orgy's, all the time." Why would orgy's? 

00:03:10

00:03:15
SUSAN JOHNSON See people don't realize what they want when they watch Monty Python, that Monty Python is just uh… could inch away from regular English life, that's why is to be. 

00:03:25
[sil.] 

00:03:30
SUSAN JOHNSON So this is funny because my mother didn't know how to pronounce orgy. And it's also funny because I went to the university of Hull which is on the edge of the North Sea, right next to the fish docks, and there was no one orgy in sight anywhere. It just wasn't gonna happen, okay, but this was a little while ago and now it feels like sex and eroticism are on show and available everywhere. In fact, I think I could probably find an orgy in my little Canadian capital of Ottawa which your talk show host on Ottawa, calls "The city without Climax." He calls, he calls New York umm… "The City Without Foreplay." I love John Oliver. So I think even in Ottawa, I could probably find an orgy. So things have changed. We're taking the ‘shoulds' and the shame out of sex. We're allowing sex to be whatever a person wants it to be, so everything's changed. But has it? In some ways it seems to me the sex is still a separate and cordoned off from the rest of human existence, the reality of human relationships as it ever was. And our field reflects this. We have sex therapy, and relationship and couple therapy, they're separate. How totally strange? Sue Carter who is here, Sue Carter the new head of the Kinsey Institute, who has spent year and years studying Oxytocin, the bonding hormone recently suggested to the USA Today that it's time for Kinsey to study human sexuality in the context of relationships, and I agree. One of the first studies I've ever read, I ever read on sex was in… came out 1992 by man called Horton and what he said was "The success of sexual stimulation techniques like sensate focus seemed to be completely determined by the couple's ratings of their communication prior to treatment." Yeah! Of course sex is a dance. we can show one partner technique for how to modify their sexual response by slowing down and squeezing the penis to prevent Premature ejaculation, but in the end it's the between the quality of the relationship interactions, the powerfully shaped partner's responses in and out of bed. In and out of bed, in focusing on an individual sexuality perhaps we forget that we are above all social bonding animals. Our bodies and our brains are designed to link with and resonate with others in and out of bed. Mae West quoted that "sex is emotion in motion." I love that emotion in motion, and attachment bonds are indeed all about emotion. Emotion is a body sensation and a way of making sense of that sensation. How you express your emotions is how you send signals to, and engage with and attach to others in and out of bed. Emotion is the music of the dance between lovers, it organizes interactions. We also call sex "making love," and attachment is a theory of love and loving. Sexual attraction and connection is part of falling in love and maintaining a bond, but even though John Bowlby, the father of attachment science told us years ago that there are three key elements to an adult love relationship, attachment, sex, and care giving. It's really only recently that the explicit links between bonding and sexuality have been explored. But in our bonds, we've always known that strong emotions sex and attachment go together. A few months ago I thought was really interesting and appropriate there was a huge fare in Las Vegas on robotics. And Roxxxy, the sex robot was a big hit. Uh… Let's see how shall we? Okay. What is really fascinating? 

00:08:30
[sil.] 

00:08:35
SUSAN JOHNSON What is really fascinating is the Douglas Hines, her creator decided not to call her Lady orgasm, what he called her is "True Companion." Yeah, and he tells by us I love this, "The physical Part of your interactions with Roxxxy will be small. You will spend most of your time with her socializing and interacting." By the way she's only programmed to talk about sex and sports. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:20
SUSAN JOHNSON But the point here is that even Hines knows, the man who created this, even Hines knows that the people who are going to buy his robot are seeking a whole lot more than orgasm. Even Hines knows that on some level they are seeking emotional connection. The New Science of bonding already has some pretty powerful things to say about sex, and things that don't always go along with the traditional psychiatrist of what sex is all about and how it works. So I'm going to talk about that but let's just in a brief snapshot for a minute get clear about what we're talking about when we talk about the new science of love. And let's look at the four, the five principles of adult bonding. This is love this is the thing that's been mysterious through the whole of human civilization. So let's put your seat belt on, this is love in four minutes, okay, got it all right. So the adult attachment perspective gives us five principles, laws of romantic bonding. Bonding with a trusted other is a compelling drive wired into the milli… by million brain by millions of years of evolution. This is all about survival. Put it another way, this is a little girl born in Ottawa. This little girl was born expecting those hands to be there. Our nervous system is designed to connect with others. We never outgrow this, we know in our bonds that if we call and no one comes, we are also vulnerable. Whether we are an infant or an adult, this is an ancient wired-in survival code designed to keep the people we need close to us. It is not just a slightly psychotic mixture of sex and sentiment that we can take or leave. And there are some other laws. Love and connection offers us a safe haven to go to where can we can maintain our emotional balance, and deal optimally with stress. It gives us a secure, secure base to grow out from to effectively explore and discover our world. Paradoxically, knowing that someone has your back you are not alone grows the ability to be independent, creative, curious about your inner and your outer world. When we lose this sense of connection with a loved one we experience emotional isolation, loneliness, panic, pain, and helplessness. And by the way, if we're talking about mental health, it seems to me that if you want one fact uh… that is a risk factor for all mental health issues, you can take emotional isolation and put it in there and it fits perfectly. Emotional isolation, panic, pain, and helplessness this distress can heighten sexuality as in classic as in make up sex, but often it also easily crowds out other concerns like sexuality. We know that the key elements in an attachment bond are perceived Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Engagement "A, R, E" as in ARE you there for me? The key question in all love relationships, responsiveness builds bonds. These four laws give us a map to love. Number five tells us about the differences we see and how we deal with bonding relationships. Secure connection with a responsive loved one promotes healthy development and functioning, and promotes a positive coherent sense of self and achievement to others. Anxious bonding or dismissing bonding, avoidant bonding constrains us and limits our growth. These labels secure, anxious, avoidant, simply describe a partner's habitual ways of dealing with emotion and responding in intimate situations. Anxiously attached fired up nervous systems are tuned to cues of rejection and abandonment. These partners are obsessed with reassurance in bed, and out of bed. But they also have a real hard time trusting and taking in that reassurance. To avoid the pain of expected rejection avoiding partners tend to normal stifled their longings or reject support from others. They shut down and shut their partners out, especially when vulnerability comes up in bed and out of bed. These five principles cracked the code of romantic love, a drama of deep in the bond-longings and existential terrors. Now let's take each one of those principles of love relationships and see what they tell us about sex.

00:14:35
SUSAN JOHNSON First of all… and this is very revolutionary. I think it's still revolutionary, John Bowlby died in 1990. He was hated and reviled like most revolutionaries were in his lifetime, and all these years later it seems to me that when I do, do talks like this it still seems to me that he's revolutionary. Attachment in these terms is the primary instinct. It is more potent than sex or aggression, safety and survival comes first. Attachment realities define and shape the other two aspects of a love relationship, caretaking and sex. Now of course caretaking and sex can operate separately from attachment, but most of the time they form an interacting system. There are some experts who focus down on the power of the sex drive, and suggest that romantic love is just all about sexual desire, in fact it's just about frustrated sexual desire, which means that once it's satiated the theory goes "love and desire just inevitably slip into loci companionship mode." Acknowledging the primacy of attachment puts much more focus on the fact that sex is not just about pleasure of procreation, it's a potent bonding activity. To bond with somebody means they become special irreplaceable, and you want to be special to them. So one of the revolutionary things that happen here is attachment theory in science suggests that actually there is nothing at all unnatural about serial monogamy. I'll need to rely on others to shape our brain, our nervous system, our hormones. Oxytocin, the so-called cuddle hormone triggered in your brain in orgasm or even when you simply think of your lover, sets the stage for optimal sexual experience by soothing the fear centers in your brain, fostering trust, and it even helps you get better at reading the signals on another person's face accurately. When bonding scientists prime men and women into sexual arousal with subliminal cues, these folks suddenly report being more willing to be emotionally close, more willing to be open, and more willing to make sacrifices for the sake of a relationship. They automatically access more bonding orientated responses. Arousal seems to naturally prime attachment unless we work at numbing out, keeping them separate, and avoiding emotional connection, unless we keep our sex compartmentalized and impersonal. Sex naturally promotes bonding and as I'm going to talk more in this talk, more effective bonding, naturally promotes great sex. Oxytocin also blocks the habituation response. So, nature has arranged it, so that the pleasure of sexual intimacy does not necessarily diminish with exposure, indeed in the best survey research happy long term lovers report the most satisfying and the most thrilling sex. So, I think we should look at replacing some of the ideas about how time and familiarity inevitably kill passion with a contrasting idea, which is "practice makes perfect." Especially when you're talking about a dance requiring teamwork. Have you ever noticed in the movies that when people make love in the movies nobody has to say anything there's no team work, nobody even ends up saying something like, "Excuse me could you move over I'm falling off the bed"? 

00:18:25
[sil.] 

00:18:30
SUSAN JOHNSON Securely attached partners are much more likely to have what I call in my book "Hold Me Tight Synchrony Sex". This requires emotional presence attunement sensitive responsiveness "A, R, E." The things that define bonding and the things that define optimal sexuality, I'm suggesting to you that the same. Synchrony sex requires emotional presence, attunement, responsiveness, and the totally engagement that only comes with emotional safety. Good sex is in astounding act of physical, emotional, and mental coordination. It's… I was thinking of it, it's a little bit like a couple assembling a piece of Ikea furniture together. But it's a lot more fun. Secure connection fosters relaxed and confident engagement in sex. If we put bonding into the equation, we arrive at a rich definition of passion that goes way beyond simple lust. Passion is attachment longing, the longing for emotional connection twinned with a attunement, and erotic exploration, and play. Attachment longing, attunement to the other, and erotic exploration, and play, it is about so much more than responding to novel stimuli or ramped up sexual tension. Secure connection is a constant process of tuning in, connecting, missing each other, disconnection, reaching, repair, and falling in love again. In this dance, if you listen to what I just said, in this dance, passion, no, it cannot be a constant and neither can love, but if we understand it passion and, and great sexuality and love can be constantly renewed. Not just by finding more erotic sexual positions, although who can resist being intrigued by some of the positions in the new Joy of Sex, I particularly was intrigued by the one called "Wailing Monkey Climbing Tree." 

00:20:50

00:21:00
SUSAN JOHNSON I haven't tried it. 

00:21:05
[sil.] 

00:21:10
SUSAN JOHNSON What I'm talking about here is renewing this passion is really in the end about changing the level of your engagement. In the moment and with your lover, if we really understand love we can also understand, it seems to me, how to shape lasting Passion. The irony is that all this research is coming out and we are discovering this at the time when we are surrounded by impersonal sex to the point where even in little Ottawa, we young men are routinely seeking help because having conditioned their brains every day since the age of twelve to respond to porn sex images, they cannot get erections with their girlfriends. We are also regularly being told that sex in long term relationships absolutely has to be vanilla, it's second choice, it's bland. So the idea is to have the spice stuck you've got to ramp it up with new lovers, rougher sex, new toys. Really? So basically let's look, let's look for a moment at a short clip from a wonderful movie called "Friends with benefits." At the difference between impersonal what I would call avoidantly attached sex, and sex is infused with emotion and attachment, the first clip, in the first clip the couple uh… agree to just have sex, cut off from relationship is a goal directed activity focused on orgasm, the couple decide that sex is like tennis. And if you notice they're completely cored up in the task and the performance, which isn't very erotic. The second clip sex is integrated with bonding. Let's see which one you think is more erotic, it goes for four minutes. 

00:23:10
JAMIE I mean, sometimes you just need it. It's like… like cracking your neck. 

00:23:15
DYLAN FRANCIS HARPER JR Why does it always gotta come with complications?

00:23:35
DYLAN FRANCIS HARPER JR Who have you been with? Why can't it not be like that? It's a physical act. Like playing tennis. Two people should be able to have sex like they're playing tennis. 

00:23:45
JAMIE Yeah, I mean, no one wants to go away for the weekend after they play tennis. 

00:23:50

JAMIE I know what I said.

[music] 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:40
SUSAN JOHNSON Uh-hmm. So, one of the principles of bonding is talking about safe haven, what's the relevance of safe haven for sexuality? In fact some people have suggested that safe haven is actually umm… umm… against eroticism. I don't think so. Secure bond… research says that secure bond sex is more likely to be relaxed and confident. Higher anxiety is linked to lower levels of arousal, intimacy, satisfaction, and lower rates of orgasm in women. Attachment anxiety also takes every lesson in satisfying sexual experience and amplifies its impact on the relationship as a whole. Danny tells me, "if Lynn doesn't want sex with me every day then that proves to me she doesn't love me, she doesn't want me and I've always felt this way." He's demanding sex all the time, and every time she hesitates, it confirms his catastrophic fears. She wants sex less and less, of course. For Danny's sexual frequency totally defines his relationship. A more secure lover can tolerate differences in desire and communicate more clearly about sexual issues. Those of us who experience safe haven connection, and nobody can have it all the time, right? We're always talking about moments of safe haven connection, good enough safe haven connection, those of us who are experienced safe haven connection always tend, also tend to have a more positive an articulated sense of self in bed and out of bed. Self as a sexual being, this focus on the emotional safety seems to be a particularly defining element in sex for women. If you expose men and women lying in a brain scan machine to explicit all subliminal sexual pictures, everybody's brain lights up. But only in women does the prefrontal cortex light up and stay on, the judgment and control center in the brain, women's brains naturally seem to pair the most… a feeling of arousal with the control center lighting up which talks about which focuses on safety concerns. This make sense. Sexual intercourse is literally much riskier for women. So, women most often need to check out the relationship to talk as part of foreplay before allowing themselves to descend into conscious active desire. Women, women in particular can be physiologically aroused, the body registers a cue as sexually relevant, but this does not necessarily translate into explicit decide wanting to have sex. All this new evidence is that women are much more sensitive to relationship contexts, to safety, and so for them desire often follows arousal rather than the classic model where desire comes first in sexuality. Desire is often the response to interactions with the partner, please note. And by the way this is the work of (inaudible )this is the work of Rosemary Basson, this is uh… the books of Emily Nagoski, right. What this means is a woman can be totally healthy and normal, and never experience spontaneous sexual desire. This research helps me explain to Danny, that the fact that his wife does not come on to him or instantly respond to every sexual signal isn't a sign that she doesn't desire him, and the emotional context he creates is key in moving her into a sexual space. He needs to get curious about what context cues activate sexual accelerator. Right now all he does is turn on his sexual break. Bonding science doesn't just talk about safe haven it talks about secure base. Secure base is that we have a… in a loving relationship we can use that as a base to go out into the world and explore, and that includes sex. What this says to me is that great sex from this point of view is a safe adventure. Thousands of studies show that a safe emotional connection fosters security and confident exploration. I think about this as umm… in the image of a zip line, okay. Can you imagine being in a forest and you're going out on a zip line? Right. The freedom and exhilaration you feel comes from precisely knowing that you are safely harnessed in, you're on a line. I ask you, "Would you be screaming we… as you go across the treetops, if you suddenly are not sure that the line was holding you." 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:45
SUSAN JOHNSON Umm… I think you guys were already through out the slide. Do I have to do it again? Yeah, thank you. I came back from Italy recently. I love a trust kind of things. And I love this picture on a fourth century umm… AD, a trust canvas. I love the look on this lady's face. She's inviting curious present and you get the feeling she's willing to experiment. She's coming from a secure base. You don't get any sense that she has worries about her partner, her performance, or her sexual self image. Hundreds of attachments studies show that safe emotional connection is the opposite of deadening in bed or out of bed. Security increases risk taking and spontaneity. A secure base allows us to play to explore each other's bodies and minds, thrilling sex is about being secure enough to surrender to the moment, to let go and see what happens, one of the implications of the attachment concepts of separation distress for sexuality. Well, we know, and this is not the Eisenberg's research that rejection registers in the adult brain in the same way and in the same place as physical pain. It's a danger cue. It primes panic, flight, fight, and freeze. These responses put a hell of a break on sexuality. Both has an up uh… obsession with possible loss and separateness, or as fearful numbing out of this danger, these tend to distract just a wee bit from erotic play. Loss of desire or lack of engagement in sexuality is most often not about familiarity putting us to sleep, but about emotional disengagement and the physical lack of achievement that goes with it, I'm going to say that again. Loss of desire or lack of engagement in sexuality is most often not simply about familiarity putting us to sleep, but about emotional disengagement and the physical lack of attunement that goes along with that disengagement. So, perhaps the most important law of attachment for sexuality is that accessibility, responsiveness, and engagement builds bonds "A, R, E," and I would argue that is what also builds optimal sexuality, Emotional and physical accessibility, responsiveness, and engagement. Emotional and physical attunement, responsiveness, and mutually engagement full presence appeared to my eyes is great sex. And I can't resist. We can see these qualities in the sexiest dance of all, Argentine tango. I'm not talking about the tango you see on umm… down some of the stars guys, okay. That's like a joke, okay. That's like that's like a parrot got its theater, okay. So, the open yet safe embrace in Tango helps each person keep their balance, recover from missteps, partners tune into and mirror each others moods in synchrony, moving from body memory, responding to a thousand cues instantly. It's a Ph D. in attunement basically which is why I think you'd all be really good at it, okay. So, it's not the steps that make the difference. The external performance, the technique that makes the dance, it's about the feeling the flow of the partners attunement makes the dance beautiful and mesmerizing. It's about the intensity of the engagement between the partners. You don't believe me? I'm going to show it to you in three minutes. This is called Narcotango. 

00:36:55

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
SUSAN JOHNSON Isn't it beautiful? It's seductive actually. I mean that was obviously rehearsed but you can see what they're expressing. Can you imagine the magic of finding out that you can just stand up umm… with somebody on the dance floor and you can get moments of that, just from tuning into each other and it's not rehearsed and suddenly your bodies are just moving together to the music, it's miraculous, and it's just to say what you feel in your therapy sessions when suddenly you're totally with somebody and you know what's going on with them emotionally, and you can move with them and they come with you, and you go to some magical place together it's just the same. So all this fits with the recent brain scan study from our lab where umm… after therapy focused on bonding conversations umm… all the male partner had to do is completely calm the brain of his lady when she was lying in an F.M.R.I. machine waiting to be shot on her ankles was to hold her hands. The couples in this study increased the security of their attachment bond, please note that's the first time anyone's ever done that ever. I'm so proud of our lab for doing that. That's the first time anyone has ever taken umm… distressed, umm… disconnected, insecure couples, and in twenty sessions of therapy, moved them into a more secure bond. Like if you told me we could do that twenty years ago, I would've said to you you're out of your mind. If, if you can do it at all it takes years to do that. But it's interesting that's how far we're coming. And these couples reported increased security of the bond and what's important for this talk. They also reported increase sexual satisfaction after therapy, and two year follow up. Even though for most of them sexuality was not a specific focus in therapy sessions. I tend to think of these results in these terms, Oh, wrong one. Sorry can I have my knight but thank you. Umm… what she's basically saying is, "Lucretia gently tries to persuade Captain Horatio that it might just be more intimate without the armor."

SUSAN JOHNSON Attachment science also says that your attachment style… habitual strategy of connecting with other people plays a huge part in orchestrating your sex life. Attachment offers us a map that tells us about the differences and how we experience sex, what motivates us here as human beings, and how we can communicate around sex. The key ingredient in better sex experience… the better sex by experience by secure lovers seems to be attuned emotional presence. As we connect emotionally, so we connect sexually. And when the emotional music has more range in debts this makes for a more multi-dimensional experience where lovers have sex for erotic pleasure to feel close, to please their partner, to express love, and to find physical release. Secure lovers report more joy and positive emotions during sex. Security forces splendid synchrony sex. And splendid synchrony sex fosters secure bonding and isn't that a clever little feedback loop that mother nature has given us? In anxious attachment a partner turns to sex mostly for proof of love and to gain affection. Chronically anxious folks have what I in my book "Hold Me Tight" called "Solace sex," where the main goal is comfort and to feel desired, the erotic is a side bar. Danny tells his wife, "If I can give you an orgasm then just for a moment, just for a moment, I get to believe that you really chose me that you want me." When I ask him if he finds sex and his orgasms fulfilling, he looks at me blankly and he simply says, "I want to know she loves me." Numbed out of avoidantaly attached lover's focus mostly on their own sensation and performance in bed, and to think typical chronically distressed relationships where demand withdrawal dances predominate there is always at least one person, usually the one person who's moving into more avoidant attachment. With this focus sex tends to be a lonely one dimensional experience. And indeed partners report their sexual satisfaction. Sex without emotion engagement is like dancing without music. It's flat. And so in my "Hold Me Tight Book" I call it Sealed off sex, and it seems to particularly fit with the old punch line that sometimes you put on umm… postcards at seaside resorts which is kind of a joke where it says, "Having a lovely time wish I was here."

SUSAN JOHNSON Chronically avoidant partners have more one night stands, report less enjoyment of kissing and cuddling, and a much more likely to endorse coercive sex. If you are numbed out, you need more extreme sensations to get turned on and stay turned on. So, a secure couple can have all these three kinds of sex synchrony sex, Solace sex, that's focused on reassurance and Sealed off sex, that's just focused on individual sensation at different times, but it seems like the ability to move at least some of the time into synchrony sex to integrate sex and bonding makes a huge difference in a couple relationship. Sex is a dance, anxious and avoidant music limits the dance. In secure attachment constrained sexuality. So, what does all this mean for intervention? Hey, we're going to talk about sex bonding, what passion it is and now we're actually gonna talk about what it means for intervention, we're covering a whole lot here. So, there have been more moral calls from movement away from medical mechanistic interventions for sexual issues, towards the integration of sex and couple therapy. If we really want to be effective sex and couple therapists, it seems to me that this separation has to end sex unless it's completely recreational happens in the context of a relationship, and the context is everything. The essence of the E.F.T. approach to treatment in a nutshell is to put sexual blocks and problems, negative cycles of sexual interaction into the context of relationship patterns of connection and disconnection. In my book 'Hold Me Tight' I write about Frank and Sylvie, and how they dealt brilliantly with his erectile problems because they end up doing with them together. But, first Frank's shame and fear failure in bed was very much part of his withdrawal in the relationship in general. Loss of her erection cued Frank in shame and fear, he's hiding, this upset Sylvie, made her an angry. Her anger and Frank's defensiveness cued further loss of erection, Sylvie felt unloved on and on and on. In bed the tents and Castle music blocked our arousal and engagement. In stage one of the E.F.T, this couple sexual dance, their repetitive negative cycle in the bedroom was integrated into the therapist's outline of the general pattern of disconnection, which they named, they called it thin ice. Hard to dance on thin, thin ice, one grown step. The dance of attachment protest by Sylvie, she was always angry asking for his attention and stonewalling by Frank was framed as the enemy that left them both afraid and alone. The therapist also included some sexual education elements normalizing the softening and hardening of the penis in a lovemaking session, and expanding sexuality to include much more than penetration. These partners began to become less triggered, and to help each other out of this demon dialogue and be able to become more open to talk to each other, to share their emotions, to share affectionate touch, and move in a different way into sexual interactions. As Frank and Sylvie began to create an emotional and sexual secure base together, they moved to the stage two of E.F.T restructuring their bond. They were able to own their softer emotions, move into a positive dance of focus on sexuality here resulted in Frank be able to express his fear of rejection in bed, and tell Sylvie what he needed from her. Sharing fears and the need for reassurance that they were indeed both desirable and desired even at times when sex did not work, made their relationship a safe haven where they could explore, play and learn in bed and out of bed. They could then deal with the issue of Charlie, which was Frank's name for his penis taking a nap, as an a tuned teen. Problems and differences were now simply that could be solved together not panic buttons, not walking out into thin ice. This couple described a scenario which I had to put in the book I couldn't resist it. A scenario that would have triggered catastrophic disconnection before therapy, where they started a love making date with Sylvie making a joke about Franks weight, and Frank withdrawing. She was then able to repair that and as Frank said, she hugged me back into feeling okay. A series of interruptions then set them up for failure their adolescent daughter came home early, and knocked on their bedroom door. The candle they lit fell over, the curtain fell on, curtain went on fire.

SUSAN JOHNSON Sometimes people tell you things in therapy, you're like. You don't need reality T.V. if you're a therapist. So needless to say with all this Charlie became very discouraged. And retreated in a number of times, so… so but then they have safe haven secure base so they simply laugh, they go downstairs, they drink cocoa, and then they were able to change the music, dash up stairs and do their version of "Wailing Monkey Clasping Tree".

SUSAN JOHNSON James Taylor, I love James Taylor. James Taylor, reminds us "Thin, thin, the moment is thin. Ever so narrow the now." If we know where to focus, if we can lean into critical moments of disconnection, that happened right here right now, and guide clients into a new physical sensuous and emotional bonding connection, then Eroticism can flower. It is fascinating to watch this kind of couple, how their bodies change in the process of therapy just like birds in ritual mating dances, they begin to open their bodies to each other, they mirror each other's moves, they start to naturally create this physical synchrony. This is just part of successful bonding and mating. It is not enough to just make partners and a little less conflictual and hope that the sex gets better. It's not enough to teach sexual techniques, and ignore the context in which they happen. We have to recast a couple's bond and then use this safety to help them ignite exploration and erotic connection, and reawake passion. The actor Peter Ustinov said, sex is a conversation carried out by other means. We are learning how to shape loving conversations. Conversations that lead to physical synchrony and erotic play that can last a lifetime. We are learning how to put sex and attachment together. We certainly do not have to choose between secure bonding and passion, one is a constantly opening doorway into the other. We can take more and more people into this. And who will show couples how to, with delicious deliberation, make and keep love in bed and out of it. All this science won't make any difference unless you take the science. The growing science of sex and bonding out into the world, you are the beacons, you are the ones that people bring their needs and fears to. We can give people hope in a world that is giving up on the relationships. We can give a version of the erotic that is stunningly personal rather than impersonal. How can anyone turn that down? I invite you to come and learn about this science and light this fire with me. We can bring science and sex, safe connection love and lust, the erotic and the emotional together. Let's just do it. Thank you.
