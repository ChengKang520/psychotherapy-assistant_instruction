ADVANCED MICROSKILLS COUNSELING SKILLS WITH Dr. Harold Engen AND Marilyn Albert Focus 

00:00:00
MARILYN ALBERT  Harold, one of the skills that I find extremely helpful is the concept of focus. You know, people tend to wanna talk about what other people talk about. 

00:00:30
HAROLD ENGEN That's my clue. I tell you, ah, focus is a very fascinating concept, it's very simple but it's very fascinating and I like to use Comierre and Comierre's concept of the Focus Cube. I think people understand the Focus Cube because it does have three dimensions that we look at: the Verb Focus, the Subject Focus, and the Time Focus. And, ah, I might just start with the Verb Focus. And what we mean by that is, what the counselor says, as a lead ah, generally, the client will follow. So, if you want the client to talk about, uhm, cognitive aspects ah, thoughts, you would ask the question or you would lead in, ah, "What are you thinking?" 

00:01:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:01:25
HAROLD ENGEN Ah, "What thoughts do you have about that?" And consequently, the client is likely to continue and talk about thoughts and thinking. If you wanna talk about feelings, ah, you would just do the same thing only, "How does that feel to you? Where are you coming from in your gut? Ah, where are you in, in your feeling responses, some way to enter that?" And generally, I'll talk about that area. And then the third dimension of the Verb Focus is dealing with behavior. And it's very easy to say, "What did you do about that? What are you going to do?" In other words, discussing their future behavior. And, ah, so it's a way in which the counselor can help focus the attention of the client to talk about specific areas. Ah, one other area is, of course, the Subject Focus. And, ah, I've seen different authored vary, but generally, the focus in the subject area will be on the client. And if you want to be on the client, you'll say, "What did you see some way to get the client... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
HAROLD ENGEN ...to talk about themselves." They don't always do it, but it, it, it is one way to do it. Ah, we'll talk about self-disclosure in another set of ah, of, ah, films. And when we do that, we're talking about the counselor. Well, when I did this or drawing from some experience, it's likely then that the client is gonna talk about you as the counselor, so you wanna be careful about switching the focus to yourself too much because it may be more appropriate to stay with the client. Ah, mutual focus or, or group focus is another concept. In other words, "What are we going to do? How are we, Marilyn, going to work on this particular thing?" (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
HAROLD ENGEN Here's, ah, mutuality. Ah, you and I are working together. And if we talk about that, the subject of the conversation is going to be in that area. Ah, very frequently, others will come in. Ah, what happens when your significant other came in here, you know? 

00:03:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
HAROLD ENGEN Substitute significant other verbs, specific name or whatever. Ah, that, the focusing on some other person ah, frequently they will do that. When you ask him about, what did you do, they may switch to a, other focus, the clients can switch the focus and that's why we think it's very important for you to be aware of that, ah, because when they switch it, you wanna be, ah, listening and using the basic listening sequence, and it's important for you to be able to understand that, hey, they're switching the focus. If I want to get back, I'm gonna have to do something that'll cause them to talk about themselves. And then, of course, topic. You may just wanna talk about a topic, you may just focus on a topic, and the questions will be directed in that way. Ah, the other one is what we call the CEC. It's really cultural, environmental, contextual, and all that means is, ah, you might wanna say, you know, society has really forced us to be in this position and then you start talking externally about societal pressures, or peer pressures, or a variety of different aspects that may have cultural, or environmental, or contextual types of, ah, focus. And then the third part of the cube, we don't have four parts, we only have three, ah, the, the third part is merely, where is the Time Focus? Is it in the past? It is in the present? Or the future? So, those three things, I think, uhm, are always a part of it. And when you break down the counselor statements, you can put them into this cube. There will be a verb focus. There will be a subject focus. There'll be a time focus. And what we're interested in demonstrating is, uhm, when a counselor moves from the cognitive to the affective or maybe the affective domain to the behavioral. In other words, this is how you're feeling about it, what are you doing about it. Uhm, I think we can have Kelly demonstrate those foursome and show them very, very concretely, ah, how this works. 

00:06:00
KELLY GALIHER So, at last week we were talking about your divorce and your feelings about that and I'd ask you kinda think about it over the past week and I guess I'm wondering what it is that you thought about or what's come in your mind? 

00:06:10
  Well, it's, I mean, it's there all the time. It's all I think about, uhm, I haven't been able to talk about it with, ah, my wife at all. Uhm, she doesn't wanna talk about it. Ah, I've, I haven't even told her that I'm seeing a counselor and we had talked about seeing a counselor before but she didn't wanna go, and I wanted to go, and, and, I guess that's finally what got me to go is just I felt like I had to do something. But I've, I just, uhm, I don't know what to do. I don't feel, uhm, real easy about just going ahead and, and wanting divorce. I don't think either of us want that, but neither of us seem to wanna do anything about it. And, uhm, I just, I wish I may just make a choice for me, I can't seem to do it. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
KELLY GALIHER Yeah. It sounds like you're feeling torn between feeling confident about making the decision but then feeling kind of ap, apprehensive about doing that at the same time. 

00:07:15
  Yeah. Uhm, ah, I mean there's no, ah, there's just no clear-cut rules about this. Uhm, I don't know, uhm, and with the kids, I don't know what to do with them. I, I, I just, I think this, just shatter them. I don't know, (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
 I mean, the kids, I think that's the only thing that keeps us together... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
 ...is the kids. Uhm, they don't know when anything's wrong. I mean, we, that's one thing we've always been very good about. It's not discussing or arguing this kind of thing in front of them. 

00:07:50
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
 Uhm, I don't know, maybe we should have. 

00:07:50
KELLY GALIHER What do you think about, when you think about telling the kids, talking to them about it? 

00:07:55
  Well, sometimes I think I, and I've, I've told, uhm, my wife is that, you know, if we're gonna split up, I don't ju, I'll just leave and tell the kids I died or something, have a mock funerals, I mean, I just, I don't want the kids to have to go back and forth. I mean, I've seen other kids with divorce and they're torn between mom and dad. And I don't wanna put them through that. And then other times I think, "Well, are we have seen other kids come through divorce okay?" Uhm, I, I don't know how to approach them on that. I don't... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
 ...I, I guess we should just sit down and start being honest with them, probably with each other, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. It sounds like that's gonna be a hard thing for you to do or actually do it. 

00:08:40
HAROLD ENGEN  Well, Marilyn, that was an example where Kelly started the interview with the client by talking about the cognitive aspect, that was where the verb focus was, the thinking of thoughts of the client, and the subject focus you appropriately put that into the client, subject focus. So, hopefully, then the client would talk about self and in the thoughts and thinking process that was going on there. And the time focus, I think, is obvious. We can let the people figure that one out themselves. 

00:09:15
MARILYN ALBERT And then Kelly changed the focus to the affective... (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
MARILYN ALBERT ...and asked John what he was feeling. 

00:09:25
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
MARILYN ALBERT You know, Harold, if people tend to talk about what other people talk about, we have a series of vignettes that we're going to show and we'll see if this is demonstrated. 

00:09:30
HAROLD ENGEN  Right. After each of the vignettes, ah, I think we could stop it or we could just run them continuously either way and have the people jot down or just talk out and, ah, you know, and understand what's going on. I mean, that's the best way to learn this, is just doing it. Once you get the cubistic model in your thought process, as a counselor, I think you'll find it extremely helpful. 

00:09:55
  Yeah. I feel very unsure. I've, there's no rules, nobody tells you, I mean, I have divorced friends but, uhm, I've also seen what they go through and I've seen what the children go through. I don't know if I can put my kids through that. And I've had, ah, two siblings that have gone through divorce and I know how my parents are about that. They're, I don't know that I can face that. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
 I don't know that I want to. Uhm, we're not, and we're not real financially secure and I know that, well, as one friend of mine said that, "Divorce is instant poverty." Uhm, I, I just don't, ah, I don't know that I can face a lot of this. I don't know that I have the courage or the strength ah, but I can't live this way either. I can't keep pretending that everything is fine. 

00:10:45
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
  Uhm, so, so, I'm very nervous. Or I guess I'm trying to save face. I, I don't know. 

00:10:55
KELLY GALIHER It sounds like your scared? 

00:10:55
  Yeah, I'm very, yeah. (chuckles) I guess I wouldn't say that but I guess perhaps I am. 

00:11:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
 I, I don't know who, I don't know how to get through this. 

00:11:10
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. I guess I'm curious to know what it is that you're thinking when you feel scared, like that. 

00:11:15
  Well, I'm thinking about, uhm, how do, how, how do I go about this. I don't know how to, to talk with the children. I don't know how to tell my parents. Uhm, also, ah, even though things are, things are really bad and I think we know that, I think just facing it, really facing it, is frightening and then what do you do after that? So, so, you agree to, to, to split up. Uhm, then what? I mean, I don't know what's beyond that, (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
 I don't, and I've never, I mean, I've been married, we've been married for 10 years and I'm very used to that. Even though it's bad, I'm used to it. I don't know what's beyond that. I don't know what to do after that and I just, I guess even, even though it's bad, it, there's a certain amount of security there. 

00:12:10
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
  Uhm, they may be false security, but, uhm, I guess I can, a lot of people do, I mean, I've seen a lot of couples, they stay together. They pretend all their lives. They're secure in that. 

00:12:25
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
 Uhm, I don't know. I, I guess I'm torn between that staying in that pretense but also scared to death of what's out there... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
 ...if I get divorced. 

00:12:35
KELLY GALIHER Yeah. So, it sounds like making the actual break in the relationship is gonna be a real hard thing for you to do because it is safe. 

00:12:45
  Uhm, I just, some of the things that would be hard about breaking re, ah, breaking this off. I mean we, we own a house together. We just bought a car, uhm, you know, trying to divide all that up. Also I, I... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
 ...like her parents a lot. Uhm, I don't know how, what kind of relationship I'll have with these people, you know, so our mutual friends. Ah, I just, I, I, I can't imagine how, how you would keep ah, those kinds of relationships going, uhm, the, I think there's just, ah, there's a lot of anger, there's a lot of anger in the relationship and I don't know how you get through that to continue any kind of relationship. I mean, with the children involved, with the in-laws involved, with friends involved, I mean, what do you do with all that? (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
 I, I just, it's like it's easier to stay here and just keep playing and it's easier, uhm, I don't know if that's easier, though. I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
KELLY GALIHER Yeah. It's a complicated issue. I've, I've thought myself about what would happen if I were to break up my own relationship. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:05
  Well, ah, then you can help, then you can understand a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
 ...about this. I mean, there is no quick right answers and I, uhm, that's what I need help with... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
KELLY GALIHER  Yeah. 

00:14:25
 ...I guess, I just, I don't know how you find that. 

00:14:25
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. Well, maybe, that's what we can focus on here together, finding some answers, helping you to find some answers within yourself. 

00:14:35
  Well, I guess that's what I need is, is answers. Ah, I can't keep going this way, I just can't. I, I don't feel like I'm functioning very well. 

00:14:45
KELLY GALIHER  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
 And I feel like I'm, ah, living two different lives most of the time. And I feel very uncomfortable with that. Uhm, I feel uncomfortable around my family, uhm, because they, they think the marriage is good. They think everything is fine. 

00:15:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
 Uhm, and I think we we're all (sighs) even though like I said earlier, there's been a couple of divorces in the family, I think that's why I feel like I have to make this one work, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
 'coz every time that there's a divorce or some sort of, ah, ah, problem within the family, my parents take that very personally, they, they think, "What did they do wrong?" And, but, well, that's another whole story, (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
KELLY GALIHER Yeah. 

00:15:30
 but I just, uhm, I think I feel that need to, to stay together even though it's not working. 

00:15:35
KELLY GALIHER  Yeah. 

00:15:40
 To, to please my parents, to please people I work with, ah, 'coz everybody, everybody thinks it's going fine. 

00:15:45
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
 And I, it's not true. 

00:15:45
KELLY GALIHER I'm wondering if some of the conflict that you're feeling within yourself might originate from our society in its, sort of, view that people should be with other people and be part of a couple or a set and always have somebody there? 

00:16:00
  Well, I think, I've always uhm, I can't remember the time when I didn't want to be married. I mean, even though when I was a kid, I just thought that marriage was, ah, a good, a good thing. And, and also, ah, my own family life wasn't real good. I, and so I thought that, when I get married, it's gonna be better. 

00:16:25
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
 You know, and that has not happened. And, so now, I mean, through high school I always dated. I got married almost right out of high school. So, I've always been with someone. 

00:16:40
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
 So, I don't know that does feel, that it would feel very odd to me when do I start dating again or do I just stay solo for a while. I don't know about that, and, so I've always, I guess I've just always felt like, you had to be with somebody or, and I've wanted it, it's not that I didn't like that. 

00:17:00
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
 Uhm, I, I'm a very people person I like uhm, and we had a lot of good times together. 

00:17:10
KELLY GALIHER Right. (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
 But now, now, what do I do? 

00:17:10
KELLY GALIHER So, it sounds like you're concerned about, since you've always been in a relationship, what's gonna happen to you now that you're not in one. 

00:17:20
COUNSELOR Kelly Galiher COUNSELING SKILLS WITH Dr. Harold Engen AND Marilyn Albert Eliciting and Reflecting Meaning 

00:17:20
HAROLD ENGEN  Marilyn, today, as we talk about reflection of meaning, I think we have to go back to some of the earlier skills like client observation and focus and, and all the basic listening sequence... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
HAROLD ENGEN ...actually, and as I think you understand the concept of, of client observation, how that fits into this, maybe you could share that a little bit with us. 

00:18:10
MARILYN ALBERT Well, it seems to me that, that the client, uhm, through their lifetime, they, they assimilate a lot of different information and situations in their life. 

00:18:20
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
MARILYN ALBERT And sometimes it doesn't always, uhm, have a meaning for them until the counselor can sit down with them and really listen to them and watch them and hear what they're saying and, and sort of, ah, figure out some of the patterns of, of their life and how they're making sense of these situations. 

00:18:40
HAROLD ENGEN By the words and by some of the values and attitudes... (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
HAROLD ENGEN ...that are descriptive in those words. That's right. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. Sometimes, life is very confusing and very complex. And reflection of meaning, uhm, is a time when the counselor can, sort of, get at the meat of what the client is trying to say. 

00:19:00
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. And I think, ah, we go back to the client observation, we go back to what the person visualizes, what they hear, what they feel, all three of those components are built into this. Uhm, I particularly like the concept of focus that we did earlier because, ah, focus fits very, very closely into the reflection of meaning when a counselor is trying to get at the meaning. Maybe we should define it first. I think the, the explanation of reflection of meaning is concerned with facilitating and assisting clients in finding meaning. In other words, a deeply felt thoughts and feelings that underline their experiences. 

00:19:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
HAROLD ENGEN  And now that's what is important. Now, that's the primary purpose of reflection of meaning. Now, the secondary ones I would say, facilitating client interpretation of their own experience, in other words, how do we make interpret their experience. Second thing, on the secondary level, be assist to clients to explore their values and goals in life. And the third thing, understanding deeper aspects of the client's experience. Now in order to do that, I think the concept of the basic listening sequence fits in here because we're going, in the counseling process, from explicit to implicit. 

00:20:35
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
HAROLD ENGEN And when we're dealing with explicit, we're dealing, ah, as a counselor in our behavior, with what we call the basic listening sequence: the paraphrasing, the summarizing, the questions you are tending. Those are all explicit because they're dealing with content. Then we're going to make the transition from the explicit to the implicit and now we're dealing with reflections of feelings, we're dealing with the concepts of immediacy and focus. When we get to the implicit, our behavior then is to elicit and reflect the meaning which is underlying all of the... (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
HAROLD ENGEN ...values and experience. And we can't do that until we've used these other skills, because we have to help the client and us, as counselors, understand what are the values, what are the attitudes, what are the... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
HAROLD ENGEN ...preceding types of count, client behavior... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
HAROLD ENGEN  that is really promoting this. So, go ahead. 

00:21:40
MARILYN ALBERT And I think that one of the ways that a, a counselor can get at that is to ask such questions as, "What does that mean to you?" 

00:21:45
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
MARILYN ALBERT And, "What sense do you make of that?" 

00:21:50
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:21:50
MARILYN ALBERT And, "What value does that represent in your life?" (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. I think the, uhm, the transparency here, the overhead that we have on the screen right now, ah, will show that very, very clearly. 

00:22:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
HAROLD ENGEN And, uhm, if you look and see the circle, we have "meaning" in the center. 

00:22:05
MARILYN ALBERT  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
HAROLD ENGEN And that's what we're looking for. But if you notice around the outsides, we have behavior. And with the behavior we have the attending behaviors, the non-verbals, ah, all of the client observations. We're dealing with the... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
HAROLD ENGEN ...behavior that the person is, is dealing with. If we go over to the, ah, bottom right side, we see thoughts are tied in there. And, ah, when we're dealing with thoughts, such dealing with thinking, as dealing with content, ah, we usually use open questions, probably... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
HAROLD ENGEN ...indirect open questions, ah, we use summary, and we use the paraphrase. And moving around to the lower, ah, left hand bottom of the circle there, we have feelings and that is dealt with primarily by empathy, 

00:22:55
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
HAROLD ENGEN and, ah, of course, by reflections of feelings. And in the other component is the eliciting and reflecting meaning. And if you notice, all of these are together. They all fit into the total picture and if you alter one of those components... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
MARILYN ALBERT  Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
HAROLD ENGEN ...you're going to alter the meaning concept and how that functions. And so, all of those fit together and it's very important, that's very important that you use them in concert. 

00:23:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
HAROLD ENGEN In other words, that you understand that you're, you're talking about behaviors. We're talking about the thoughts and the thinking. We're talking about feeling. We're bringing all of those into components and then, and only then can we use the questions that you were talking about, ah, what does this mean to you? What sense do you make of that? Uhm, what values underline your action? Or, uhm, help me understand, ah, what makes that important to you? What was the intent? All of those are eliciting the meaning... (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
HAROLD ENGEN ...and, ah, of course, if we're going to have any process at all, we have to understand, and we probably should've discussed this earlier 'coz it is so critical, the meaning has to come from the client. It's their meaning. 

00:24:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
HAROLD ENGEN It's not an interpretation that the counselor makes, although we're tempted to do that. And you have to be patient. And then when you elicit to the questions we just talked about, then we do what we call, a reflection of meaning. In other words, we try to put into words what their values and attitudes and thoughts that are underlying, ah, what they really mean. But we can never say, "Hey, I've got it, this is it." 

00:25:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
HAROLD ENGEN We always check out, hey, am I close, does that make sense to you, whatever it is. And so that's, uhm, that's the basic concept of meaning which is not quite as simple as I think we've made it. Ah, I think if we look at Kelly... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
HAROLD ENGEN  ah, and then, ah, have Kelly, ah, go through some of the basic listening sequence and maybe elicit and reflect some meaning, ah, you and I can, ah, comeback and comment about that. 

00:25:30
KELLY GALIHER Karen, I'm wondering if you thought anymore about the decision that you've been longing over. 

00:25:35
KAREN Well, I've been trying to decide whether I'm really fit for an actors, an actress, an actress's life or not. 

00:25:45
KELLY GALIHER  Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
KAREN Because when, when I intended to be an English major and to pursue writing, I mean, that's a completely different thing. You can absorb yourself in your books. 

00:26:00
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
KAREN You can make decisions that will affect, uhm, I mean, that you can, you can make decisions and then see how they affect you and you can change your mind without affecting anyone else really. And I guess, where my problem lies is just making decisions. And when, when you're an actress, you have to make decisions all the time about, uhm, about characters, about, uhm, where you're going to go, who you're going to see. On... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
KAREN  how you're going to live. I mean, I don't, ah, one thing is that I don't really know if I wanna live an actress's life because of the things that I'm used to, the way I'm used to living. 

00:26:40
KELLY GALIHER Yeah. So, it's the decisions that make you feel kind of hurried? 

00:26:45
KAREN Yes. Exactly, and there, there has always been a person in my life who has sort of been a guiding light... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
KAREN ...that I could look to, to bounce my ideas off them, and, and to help me make decisions. And now I'm, I'm stuck without anyone like that. 

00:27:05
KELLY GALIHER  So, you're feeling kind of lost? 

00:27:10
KAREN Yes. And I don't, I don't have the kind of input, I don't think to make the right kind of decision yet, but I have to make a decision and go some place. Uhm, and I feel that if I want to be an actress, I have to make that decision now. So, like I said, I'm, I've already applied to the University of Iowa. 

00:27:30
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
KAREN  And I don't, I really like the University of Michigan but I don't, I can't stay there if I want to be an actress. 

00:27:40
KELLY GALIHER All right. So, Karen, what do you think, now that you're here at Iowa about the Theatre Arts Program? 

00:27:45
KAREN Uhm, I think that the graduate program is very good and that that trickles down into the undergrad. I think, uhm, I'm finding more and more that the undergraduate program is very good. We'll have some new faculty members that I'm really excited about. There are a lot of acting opportunities. You just... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
KAREN ...have to be there, audition and, and look for them. And I'm learning a lot of things about, uhm, an actress's professional life and about the internal stuff that goes on, 

00:28:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
KAREN ah, the, the self-questioning and things like that which leads me back to the same old thing, decision-making and. 

00:28:25
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. So, the schedule around being an actress is really what you've been learning about and concentrating on? 

00:28:35
KAREN The schedule? 

00:28:35
KELLY GALIHER  Well, it sounds like that's sort of the part of the acting is, is meaningful for you. You said it was important and you've been learning about it. 

00:28:45
KAREN Well, that's, that's one of the things. That's, the scheduling but that's, really what I've been trying to do is look, look further inside, you know, and, and, ah, I've, I've just been trying to figure out whether acting is right for me and sure the, I mean, I'm, I'm confused, though. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
KELLY GALIHER And you just don't know if the lifestyle of being an actress is gonna be right then? 

00:29:20
KAREN Right. I'd, I'd, I'm worried a little bit about the lifestyle but I'm also, I'm also worried about, well, what I'm worried about in the lifestyle is that I don't know whether I have an innate to endure that or whether I can just push all that aside and, and, and say, well, this is worth it, this is worth anything. And that's really what I'm trying to find out. 

00:29:45
HAROLD ENGEN Marilyn, Kelly's demonstration, I think, ah, was indicative of what counselors do. Ah, they're, they're really quite proficient in the basic listening sequence. Ah, they can paraphrase. Uhm, they can use attending skills, ah, they can use reflection of feelings which gets at behavioral and, and the cognitive and the affect of the feelings. When they get to the reflection of meaning, I'd like to have you give me, ah, your reaction to Kelly. 

00:30:15
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. Uhm, I think that Kelly had elicited her meaning not necessarily the client's meaning. 

00:30:25
HAROLD ENGEN Okay. That's quite common. 

00:30:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
HAROLD ENGEN Uhm, let's look at the next two counselor comments to that same introductory client statement and, ah, see what we react to them. 

00:30:45
KAREN Yes. And I don't, I don't have the kind of input, I don't think, to make the right kind of decision yet, but I have to make a decision and go some place. Uhm, and I feel that if I want to be an actress, I have to make that decision now. So, like I said, I'm, I've already applied to the University of Iowa. 

00:31:10
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
KAREN And I don't, I really like the University of Michigan, but I don't, I can't stay there if I want to be an actress. 

00:31:15
KELLY GALIHER All right. I guess I'm curious to know what it is about being an actress that, that's so appealing to you. 

00:31:20
KAREN  That's a really hard question even for, I think for people who have been in, in the profession for a long time. 

00:31:30
KELLY GALIHER  Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
KAREN It's hard to pinpoint that. I think what attracts me so much is partly the success that I've had within in the past, the, the good feelings from being on stage and I guess everyone wants attention but I, I don't think that I should go into something because I want attention and I need the attention. 

00:31:55
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
KAREN I think that I need to, I just need to express parts of me that can't be expressed in ordinary life and especially not in, well, uhm, especially not in a writer's, maybe not in a writer's life, I mean, not, not early on in their life anyway whether, you know, all in their thoughts in there and they're trying to develop, I, I'm really not sure. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. So, it sounds like it's the self-expression and, and kind of the excitement that's a little of the worrying. 

00:32:30
KAREN Yes. 

00:32:30
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
KAREN  I think, I think I'm also, see, I, I get caught up in, in ideas about, oh, and in dreams, in, in what I could become in being, I guess in being an artist. 

00:32:50
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
KAREN And I really want to have a craft of my own, something that I can concentrate on and call my own and really absorb myself in. 

00:33:00
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
KAREN And I want to be able to share that with others. 

00:33:05
KELLY GALIHER So, it sounds like, having something for yourself that you can be proud of, that is really meaningful for you. 

00:33:15
HAROLD ENGEN  We had an example there where Kelly did a open question, getting into her thoughts. And, uhm, I felt it did facilitate the client to talk about some of the underlying aspects. 

00:33:30
MARILYN ALBERT  I think what Kelly was attempting to do was to get to, to the values of the, of the client and find out just, you know, how she valued the decision that she was trying to make. 

00:33:45
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. I think that's exactly right. 

00:33:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
HAROLD ENGEN And, uhm, then Kelly did come back and reflect those values and bring them to the surface so that they could discuss them further. And, ah, although we didn't have a very long interaction here, it would go on quite, (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
HAROLD ENGEN quite extensively and possibly at a, at a deeper level. Ah, what I mean by a deeper level, the client would then be talking about some of the values and some of the attitudes and, and the conditions necessary for making this a very important decision that she was making. Let's look at once more, uhm, this gives the class the option of looking at, what we feel, uhm, is something that happens frequently, the interpretation, where the counselor is not really reflecting the meaning and not, the meaning may not be coming directly from the client but from the attitudes and values and backgrounds that the, that the counselor has. Let's look at that. Following that, I wanna comeback and discuss a little bit about Frankl and some of the other theories that use this. 

00:34:50
MARILYN ALBERT Okay. 

00:34:50
KAREN  Yes, and I don't, I don't have the kind of input. I don't think, to make the right kind of decision yet, but I have to make a decision and go some place. Uhm, and I feel that if I want to be an actress, I have to make that decision now. So, like I said, I'm, I've already applied to University of Iowa. 

00:35:15
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
KAREN And I don't, I really like the University of Michigan, but I don't, I can't stay there if I want to be an actress. 

00:35:25
KELLY GALIHER All right. So, Karen, am I right in assuming that it was kinda tough for you to make this decision to come to Iowa because Michigan, kind of, had everything you wanted except the Theater Arts sort of emphasis that Iowa did, but you still are looking for some guidance and a sounding board, if you will, to try to make some future decisions also. 

00:35:45
KAREN That's exactly right. I just keep, ah, even now, I mean, this is just, this first, this first semester is sort of like a trial for me to see if I can really, if, ah, an actress's life is really appropriate for me, if I can take it. 

00:36:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
KAREN Uhm, of course, it's not like being out in the real, in the real acting world, I mean, competitive world, but it's, it's going to give me a little bit of a flavor of what that life will be. 

00:36:15
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
KAREN And I think that I just, I, I was really afraid, and I'm still really afraid of not being able to go back and, and take off from where I, I left off, you know, if this isn't right for me. 

00:36:35
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
KAREN I think I, I always start thinking of losing time and getting behind and, and that's why I get really nervous when I don't have a sounding board, like you said, uhm, to help me make decisions. I mean, I, I know I've got to grow up sooner or later... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
KAREN ...start making my own decisions, and I'm trying to do that more and more, and no matter, and, and this was a big part of it, I mean, I decided I had a choice to go to Cambridge. 

00:37:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
KAREN To study English, uhm, Literature and, uhm, I knew that I wouldn't have a chance to study acting there. There would be plenty of opportunities, but I wouldn't get coaching. And I really like the University of Michigan, like I said. It gives me everything I want except the Acting Program, so to come here is putting all my eggs in one basket and seeing if it works out, and. (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
KELLY GALIHER Good. It sounds like it was a, it was a big step for you to come here and to, to do that, to put all your eggs in one basket. 

00:37:35
KAREN  Uh hmm. It is and I'm still trying to see whether it's working out. And I'm making decisions and sticking with them, uhm, e, and not, e, it used to be that ah, I make, I make the decision, but then I'd question it later down the line... (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
KAREN ...I mean, you, you have to know how to do that. 

00:37:55
KELLY GALIHER  Right. 

00:38:00
KAREN But you also have to learn how to just make a decision and stick with it and go with it no matter what. 

00:38:05
KELLY GALIHER Right. It, it does seem to all come back to this issue of, of decision-making when you talk about Cambridge or you talk about acting or Michigan. It, it all does seem to eventually come right back into that question of, "How do I make a decision?" 

00:38:20
HAROLD ENGEN Marilyn, from our previous conversations, I know that you're, uhm, an advocate of, of Frankl and that you've read some things about and maybe you could start with that theoretical approach. 

00:38:35
MARILYN ALBERT Well, the things that I like about logotherapy is that, uhm, it gives the counselor a chance to get at the real core of, of the human, and really find out, ah, what the underlying meaning is and how it can, uhm, how he can turn that into a positive aspect of the person's life, and that he can, sort of, transcend suffering and find the meaning for that, and, ah, turn that into a positive experience. 

00:39:05
HAROLD ENGEN Of course, this all originated when Frankl was in the concentration camp and, (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
MARILYN ALBERT Right. 

00:39:10
HAROLD ENGEN and then out of that came the search for meaning, which I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
HAROLD ENGEN ...sure many of the people have read. Ah, we tend to think in terms of meaning being connected with Frankl, ah, but, I think Freud in Psychoanalytic and some of the others in Psychoanalysis have, have used meaning definitely. 

00:39:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
HAROLD ENGEN Ah, certainly, Ellis uses it in, ah, rational-emotive psychotherapy, ah, Beck and others in the Cognitive, ah, certainly with Behavioral, and, ah, my old friend, Arnold Lazarus, in the Multimoda, (crosstalk). 

00:39:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
HAROLD ENGEN certainly does use meaning to get to the underlying issues, and that's what we're all about. So, the use of meaning has enhanced my counseling, and I would hope that, uhm, the people would practice and work on this because it's not gonna come easily. We're turning it around. What is the meaning that the client is projecting? 

00:40:10
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
HAROLD ENGEN And we have to reflect that and check it out. 

00:40:15
MARILYN ALBERT And I think no matter what your foundation is in counseling or what approach you use, that you should find out or develop within yourself that way of finding meaning using that approach. 

00:40:25
HAROLD ENGEN  Exactly. 

00:40:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
COUNSELOR Kelly Galiher COUNSELING SKILLS WITH Dr. Harold Engen AND Marilyn Albert Assertion/Confrontation 

00:40:30
MARILYN ALBERT  Harold, sometimes, I'm working with a client and what they're saying and what they're doing isn't congruent. What do you do when a client is giving you conflicting statements? 

00:41:10
HAROLD ENGEN Well, usually, when they're giving you a conflicting statements, they're trying to avoid something. Not always, but I would think that's a very prevalent thing and that's what we do when we talk about confronting. 

00:41:20
MARILYN ALBERT  Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
HAROLD ENGEN The concept of confrontation is one that's really misunderstood because a lot of people think the confronting counselor is the one who is constantly attacking, attacking, attacking. The concept that we wanna get across is what we call a caring or a constructive confrontation. And in here, ah, in answer to your first question, we'd probably just give them a question or give them a chance to look at what their discrepant behavior is showing. And there's a, a number of different purposes for which we'll, we'll go through right now. 

00:42:00
PURPOSES OF CONFRONTATION 

00:42:00
HAROLD ENGEN  Uhm, it'll help the client become more congruent, was whether he or she is saying and how, or he or she is behaving. Ah, when you confront, it establishes the counselor as a role model, ah, in using direct, honest and open communication, and that's very helpful for a client to see a role model and say, "If the cloun, counselor's being open, I will." (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
* Focuses on possible behavior changes. 

00:42:30
HAROLD ENGEN And then it tends to focus on problems about which the client might take some action or they might change their behavior, and that's important. And, it often breaks down the defenses of the client, uhm, and these defenses are sometimes conscious, but frequently unconscious, and so we help them bring them to the surface again when we confront in a caring manner. Ah, it tends to, ah, enrich the condition of empathy, and we've discussed empathy before and that's putting yourself in a place of the client. And I think that enriches it when you use a very good constructive confronting process. And finally, it kind of encourages the client to acknowledge some feelings and behaviors and other processes or sort of been implicit again under the surface and hidden. So, uhm, that's the, ah, the basic five or six purposes of, of confronting. And, ah, maybe you could share with us just a little bit about your ideas of some of the discrepant behaviors that a client might demonstrate. 

00:43:45
MARILYN ALBERT Well, there, there definitely are discrepant behaviors. 

00:43:50
DISCREPANCIES 

00:43:50
MARILYN ALBERT And, uhm, one of the types of discrepant behaviors that there are is- 

00:43:55
* Client's appraisal -- Others' appraisal. 

00:43:55
MARILYN ALBERT - sometimes the client doesn't see himself or herself the way that other people see him or her. And, sometimes- 

00:44:05
* Client's statements -- Actual behavior. 

00:44:05
MARILYN ALBERT - there's a contradiction between what the client is saying and how he is perceiving his behavior. Ah, another one is, ah,- 

00:44:15
* One of client's statements -- Another statement. 

00:44:15
MARILYN ALBERT - discrepancy between two statements. 

00:44:15
HAROLD ENGEN Sure. 

00:44:15
MARILYN ALBERT  Uhm, a fourth type might be- 

00:44:20
* Client's feelings -- Those normally expressed by others. 

00:44:20
MARILYN ALBERT - the client says, uhm, is, says one thing because he, he feels that is expected for him, you know, him to say. He's, he's, he's giving a response that is acceptable to other people. And another, uhm, type of discrepancy- 

00:44:35
* Client's present statements -- Past behavior. 

00:44:35
MARILYN ALBERT  -is, ah, contradiction between what the client is now saying and what he or she believes, uhm, he did in, in the past. 

00:44:50
HAROLD ENGEN And all of these, I think, it's necessary for us to go back to the basics again. We have to do the observation skills... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
HAROLD ENGEN ...and we have to do the basic listening sequence, and we really have to be very attentive to the client's non-verbal as well as their verbal behavior. 

00:45:05
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
HAROLD ENGEN And, ah, maybe some guidelines. Ah, what should you do when you're gonna confront? Well, first of all, I think you have to assess whether you're doing it out of your own or the counselor's welfare. Ah, sometimes, if we take the old model, a person will confront just to they're mad at the client or they'll, they care enough about their client and say, "Hey, you're doing something so obviously wrong here, ah, I want you to get it straightened out." In other words, we're doing it for our benefit, probably more than the client's and we have to take that into consideration. Ah, timing is very important. Uhm, you don't confront early. You build a relationship, you have to earn the right to get into a confronting mode, ah, where you're understanding the client's... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
HAROLD ENGEN ...strengths and weaknesses and all of the other aspects. And I think that mutual trust has to be there. Ah, clients have to feel that, ah, you're on their side, in a mutual, ah, respect that you have... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
HAROLD ENGEN ...has to be generated, and that's very clear. And I think, uhm, a client, if their indiscrepant behavior, whether it's conscious or unconscious, ah, there's still some awareness there if you are specific. And so, I like to look at it as here and now, pretty much, I don't think we say, now, seven years ago or, or whatever, ah, seven weeks ago even. 

00:46:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
HAROLD ENGEN Ah, I think you need to be very specific and concrete and be very direct in what you are talking about with the client so that there's no misunderstanding, so it's very clear. Now that's, uhm, that's risky. That's risky to the client and it's also risky to the counselor. When you confront, you're taking the risk that the counselor might, ah, the client might, ah, just, ah, deny it. And that's an end result. That, that definitely could happen. Uhm, we like to think in terms of, ah, the whole concept of what you're very familiar, assertion. 

00:47:10
MARILYN ALBERT Right, uh-hmm. 

00:47:10
HAROLD ENGEN  Now, if you could, ah, sort of, set the stage for Johnson's Model of Constructive Confrontation by discussing assertion a little bit, I think that would be helpful. 

00:47:20
MARILYN ALBERT Okay. Well, I think there are, there are three different areas and, first of all, we look at the passive behavior, which is a person who will not let their needs or their wants or their rights known to others. And in doing so, they either suffer silently because of the consequence or lack of consequence. 

00:47:45
HAROLD ENGEN They just get trampled. 

00:47:45
MARILYN ALBERT Right. 

00:47:45
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
MARILYN ALBERT Right. They, they, they sort of adapt this "poor me" attitude and "I can't change anything" and "nobody will listen to me." 

00:47:55
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
MARILYN ALBERT And then the second type of behavior is the aggressive behavior, where it, which is totally the opposite, where the person is letting their rights known and they're doing it in a very aggressive way or they might infringe on the rights of other people, and they're not, uhm, aware of the feelings or caring about the reactions of other people. They just wanna make sure what they want is known and that they get it. 

00:48:20
HAROLD ENGEN So, an inappropriate confrontation is frequently an aggressive counselor. 

00:48:25
MARILYN ALBERT Right. 

00:48:25
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
MARILYN ALBERT Right. 

00:48:25
HAROLD ENGEN Well, let's get into the assertive confrontation that we're talking about now, what would that be? 

00:48:30
MARILYN ALBERT Okay. Well, this is the ideal situation where a person is letting their desires or their rights or their wants known, and they're doing it in an unthreatening way so that they are not infringing on the rights of other people. 

00:48:45
HAROLD ENGEN Uh hmm. So, an assertive counselor would stand up for their own rights without infringing upon the rights of the client. 

00:48:55
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
HAROLD ENGEN Let me run through the seven or eight steps that, ah, we wanna demonstrate today. We call it "constructive confrontation." 

00:49:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
HAROLD ENGEN It's a process that came out of a, a study and a book by, ah, David Johnson from University of Minnesota. We've used it here on campus for quite a number of years and, ah, you don't have to follow all the steps, but I think you have to have the conditions for the steps necessary. The first thing is, ah, the counselor generally makes a personal statement. Ah, personal statement could be something like, ah, "Marilyn, I need to talk to you." So it usually has an "I" statement. Ah, next, a relationship statement, which some people leave out, but I think it has to be a condition that's necessary, "Marilyn, you and I have worked together now for, oh gosh, two, three years." 

00:49:50
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
HAROLD ENGEN Ah, there's a relationship, building some commonality. Uhm, when you do, ah, in other words, we get to... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
HAROLD ENGEN ...what the discrepant behavior is or what we're confronting about. 

00:50:05
3. BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION 

00:50:05
HAROLD ENGEN Uhm, and generally, what we try to do there is, like a, allude it to or we try to deal with what positive aspects rather than negative aspects. If we can deal with the confrontation being a constructive strength that you have, but maybe have not used as efficiently or recently. 

00:50:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:50:25
HAROLD ENGEN If we can deal with strengths at this point, rather than just weaknesses and confront you on that, ah, I think that's an extremely important conceptualization. Research has shown that those counselors who are very effective, do strength confrontation. We might wanna discuss that a little bit more after the film is over with the class. The other thing then is, after you give your statement, you wanna let the client know how it has made you feel. 

00:50:55
MARILYN ALBERT  Uh hmm. 

00:51:00
4. DESCRIPTION OF OWN FEELINGS 

00:51:00
HAROLD ENGEN Some counselors are not able to do that, and, ah, I still think that condition needs to be there. In other words, "How do I feel about the fact that you're not using these strengths that you have capabilities of doing, but you're not utilizing now?" (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
HAROLD ENGEN "I'm not feeling, ah, very, ah, ah, good about the fact that you have these abilities and they're not being drawn upon." That may not be as good example, but I think... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
HAROLD ENGEN ...it gets the idea. Those three or four different first steps come pretty fast and may even be in one or two or three or four, five sentences by the counselor. The client comes in and starts talking then, ah, "Well, gosh, I guess you're right," or ah, "Oh, I don't know about that," or whatever. That's the time when you do the ah, fifth step which is really understanding statements. 

00:51:50
5. UNDERSTANDING RESPONSE 

00:51:50
HAROLD ENGEN In other words, you paraphrase. See how I used those basic skills? (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:51:55
HAROLD ENGEN You paraphrase what the person is saying to let them know you understand. Ah, the next step would be, ah, perception check, where you would check and see if your perception of what they're feeling is accurate. Ah, "I'm sensing right now that you're maybe a little tiffed with, ah, what I said earlier," and then they could clarify that. Ah, another step that may or may not be used, but it uh, it is one that can be used, and that's interpretation. 

00:52:25
7. INTERPRETATIVE RESPONSE 

00:52:25
HAROLD ENGEN And, ah, you might interpret what you think is, ah, possibly some of the underlying reasons why or, ah, you can even go to eliciting and maybe reflecting meaning, which might even be stronger than interpretation from you if you get the meaning from the client right here. That would... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
HAROLD ENGEN ...be important. And the final thing that Johnson calls, uhm, feedback. 

00:52:50
8. CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK 

00:52:50
HAROLD ENGEN Ah, I expand that to say, this is really the process where the counselor and the client work on the steps, the process that they're going to use, maybe, to implement what the counselor had identified earlier and what the client has verified in their reflection of meaning statement or whatever. And so, that's the eight steps: a personal statement, a relationship statement, a statement of what the concern is, how the counselor feels, an understanding statement, and then a perception check, and then an interpretation or reflection of meaning, and then what we call feedback or working to resolve the situation. Kelly has a demonstration. Let's see how many of the steps that Kelly puts in, in this one and then we'll come back and talk about it. 

00:53:35
ASSERTIVE CONFRONTATION 

00:53:35
KELLY GALIHER  Well, Tom, it's been a week since we've seen each other, and I'm wondering- 

00:53:45
PERSONAL STATEMENT 

00:53:45
KELLY GALIHER - if you thought anymore about the things we were working on, concerning your, uhm, cocaine problem. 

00:53:50
TOM MOSEMAN Well, yeah. I think that, you know, we, we've done a lot of work and, and I was feeling a real good like all through the week about all the plans that we made, ways to deal with things. (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
TOM MOSEMAN And then this weekend, like, some old friends of mine came into town and we went to a party and, and, you know, had a few drinks, and then before you know it, it was like we were doing some coke again, and, and it was... (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
TOM MOSEMAN ...like I, I just, like all of a sudden, realized what I was doing and I, I wasn't even thinking about it, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:54:20
TOM MOSEMAN And, and ah, I just sort of, ah, it was just ah, a habit, you know, force of habit of, like, being with these people and was the natural kind of thing to do. 

00:54:30
KELLY GALIHER Okay. Well, I guess I'm a little concerned because over the past- 

00:54:35
RELATIONSHIP STATEMENT 

00:54:35
KELLY GALIHER - six months that we've been working together, you've shown so much progress and, uhm, you were able to stay- 

00:54:45
BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION 

00:54:45
KELLY GALIHER - within your group of friends and let them know that, if they were gonna be your friends, they're going to have to respect your choice not to do cocaine. And I think that we can use, keep progressing and use some of those same strategies in, maybe, uhm, dealing with your other friends- 

00:55:05
DESCRIPTION OF OWN FEELINGS 

00:55:05
KELLY GALIHER - because I have been pleased with those strategies that we've used. 

00:55:10
TOM MOSEMAN Yeah, well, you know, it's, it's really easy with people that live right here in town, but, you know, when you get these people that, you know, from different part of your life, it's real tough because they, they don't know and they don't, (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
TOM MOSEMAN they don't understand, you know, 'coz they, they haven't been, like been here with me when we had problems and all. 

00:55:25
KELLY GALIHER Right. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
TOM MOSEMAN And so, so, I, I don't know. I mean, it's, it's hard to talk to them about it. You know what I mean? 

00:55:30
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. So,- 

00:55:35
UNDERSTANDING RESPONSE 

00:55:35
KELLY GALIHER - it sounds like things were pretty much going okay until your other friends came into town, and things got thrown off a little bit. 

00:55:40
TOM MOSEMAN Yeah, yeah. It, it really made me feel like I was, kind of, like in a different place, you know, and, and, uhm, and like before I got aware that, that it was a problem, you know. And, and, I, so I was like not even thinking and I, I was just sort of, like, I felt like I was back there again, you know? 

00:55:55
KELLY GALIHER Right. 

00:55:55
PERCEPTION CHECK 

00:55:55
KELLY GALIHER  It was kind of disorienting for you then? Am I right? 

00:56:00
TOM MOSEMAN Yeah, yeah, that, that's it. I'm sort of like, you know, disoriented and, and, you know, I was like, just there, yeah. 

00:56:05
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
INTERPRETATIVE RESPONSE 

00:56:05
KELLY GALIHER  What do you think about the possibility that maybe some of that disorientation arose from, uhm, you're not being used to having a drug control you because when we were working before, you were doing such a good job of being in control of the drug, and then when you got back into that situation, the tables kinda turned a little bit? 

00:56:30
TOM MOSEMAN  Yeah, yeah. I think that's probably right. It was, it was, uhm, 'coz, you know, I was in the same situation as I used to be when, when that was the case, and, and then it all kind of started over again. So, so that ah, I did forget, you know, to, to be in charge. 

00:56:50
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
TOM MOSEMAN And so, yeah. I think that's right. 

00:56:55
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. What do you think- 

00:56:55
CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK 

00:56:55
KELLY GALIHER - are some possible ways that we can work together and, and devising to, a plan to stay on our original plan, of you being in control of those drugs? 

00:57:05
TOM MOSEMAN  Well, now that, that I have this experience, uhm, I know what to watch out for, you know, like people from my past that, that might be coming back. And, and then, you know, that I, now I know that it's something I gotta watch out for, and that, (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
KELLY GALIHER  Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
TOM MOSEMAN that I have to be in charge like, like you told me and, and that, uhm, and to be aware that, that, you know, that the circumstances around it can like affects what, whether I'm in charge or not. (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
KELLY GALIHER Right. 

00:57:35
TOM MOSEMAN And so, and maybe the other thing is that, you know, I mean, hopefully, maybe I won't be in those situations. And, and maybe if, uhm, maybe I need to talk to my friends and make sure that they understand what I, what's going on for me, you know? 

00:57:50
KELLY GALIHER Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
TOM MOSEMAN And, and you know, like you told me before to, to take control and, and make sure my friends understood what I, what I need to do. 

00:58:00
KELLY GALIHER Right, so maybe, like you say, being a little bit more assertive in what you want and letting that be known might be something that ah, would help. 

00:58:10
TOM MOSEMAN Yeah. 

00:58:10
Do you think this example was sufficiently assertive? 

00:58:10
MARILYN ALBERT  Well, Harold, I can, I can clearly see how an assertive approach would be much more beneficial. 

00:58:25
HAROLD ENGEN I think so, and, uhm, it depends a lot on the client. I think you would confront... (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
HAROLD ENGEN ...in keeping with the conditions of the counseling process that you have... (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
MARILYN ALBERT Uh hmm. 

00:58:35
HAROLD ENGEN ...ah, consistent with your counseling theory and particularly, ah, if you have a trust to establish with the person and they know where you're coming from, it does give the client more interactive ability. It does give them a chance to get the underlying meaning in where they're coming from. Ah, I felt Kelly followed the model. (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
MARILYN ALBERT Hmm. 

00:58:55
HAROLD ENGEN  And used all of the, fairly most of the steps and, what would people might like to do is rewind the tape to the beginning of that interview and, ah, just take a paper and pencil and jot down and see if, if, uhm, if Kelly did, in fact, use all these. But, uhm, to me, it's a good process, it's a constructive way, it's a caring process, and with certain types of clients, I think it's an effective way to do it.
