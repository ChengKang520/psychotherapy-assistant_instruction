BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons and I teach counseling at the University of Wales, Newport. We made quite a lot of videos and DVDs here. And about a year ago we made one that was particularly well received called CPT Skills in Practice. That was the work of a colleague of mine, Frank Wills and was based on a series of CBT sessions that Frank conducted in the studio with another colleague Jan Gray acting in the role of client. Now that program was made for people who already had a basic understanding of CBT. But we said at the time that we would be returning to the tapes of the session to make another program for people who knew nothing about CBT. And this is that program. So Frank, where do we make a start? 

00:00:50
FRANK WILLS Okay, well, our aim is to give a really good picture of CBT here. And essentially, what CBT does is it identifies problematic ways of thinking that people have which then go on to cause them both emotional problems and behavioral problems. And then having built up an understanding of how those different components fit together within you know, do our cognitive behavioral methods do try and shift bits of it. 

00:01:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so it's how I am thinking… 

00:01:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:01:25
MIKE SIMMONS …with effect how I'm feeling and how I am behaving. 

00:01:30
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:01:30
MIKE SIMMONS And there is a kind of cycle going on there. 

00:01:30
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:01:30
MIKE SIMMONS And you're trying to get in there to, to change the pattern. 

00:01:35
FRANK WILLS Exactly, exactly. 

00:01:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right, okay. 

00:01:35
FRANK WILLS Actually in the technical terms for what I've just said would be the first step is to assess the client's functioning their, their thinking and feeling and behaviors and, and so then build that assessment into what we call a formulation or a model of the client's present problematic functioning and then using interventions to come in to try to disrupt the various elements and to try to divert the, the negative pattern into a more positive direction. 

00:02:10
MIKE SIMMONS So you start off by trying to find out what's happening, you present, you establish a formulation which seems to explain what's happening and then you're actually disrupting and engaging within somewhere. 

00:02:25
FRANK WILLS And I should say here that all that goes on within a therapeutic relationship. 

00:02:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right! 

00:02:30
FRANK WILLS And I'm… I don't particularly want to get into a theoretical discussion of that at the moment, but I think what we can do is we can see a relationship developing and then… 

00:02:35
MIKE SIMMONS Very clearly. 

00:02:35
FRANK WILLS …maybe we can come back to discussing that a bit later. But the first element would be assessment that's what we are gonna have a look at now. One thing to be aware of is that what we're trying to do here is to develop quite a detailed picture of the, the client's present patterns. And one, one of the reasons we do this is because we like to get what's called a baseline. Once we got the baseline we're then more able to assess and you know, improvement and change. 

00:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS Can… But can you explain that a bit more baseline? 

00:03:15
FRANK WILLS Yes, I certainly will. It's a sort of thing you know, when initially quite often when I, I see a client who we say you know, quite depressed they will frequently report that you know, they're pretty well depressed everyday, some point during everyday of the, the week. But it's important to know that because and as they start to improve there may be days when they're not depressed, which is a step forward, but unless you know that they were depressed everyday to begin with you don't know then being depressed only five or six days… 

00:03:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:03:55
FRANK WILLS …it's, it's a tiny step forward. 

00:03:55
MIKE SIMMONS I got you. 

00:03:55
FRANK WILLS And actually I think you know that the change is often a series of quite small steps which would gradually build up moments that's important to catch them. 

00:04:10
MIKE SIMMONS The baseline is almost what you are measuring from. 

00:04:10
FRANK WILLS Exactly. 

00:04:10
MIKE SIMMONS If you are looking for some kind of improvement you need to know where it is from. 

00:04:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and, and I mean, I wanted to say also and this becomes apparent in some further extracts, you know although we're very interested in the symptoms and the current problems we are also interested in more underlying things like, you know with childhood experiences and so forth. So the one, interesting one doesn't exclude interest in the other. 

00:04:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS And what I also hope you'd see now and throughout all these extracts that we're going to see on, on CBT sessions that the same time it's being having this kind of scientific interest in the detail it is really important to really listen and be emphatic towards the client as well. 

00:04:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:04:55
FRANK WILLS Again one doesn't exclude the other. 

00:04:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. Okay, so shall we have a look at that first. 

00:05:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, let's do now. 

00:05:00
Assessment (a) – from the first session 

00:05:00
JAN GRAY Living death, because you know where do you go. 

00:05:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… there is no hiding place. 

00:05:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:05:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… okay. So, so what we can take from that anyway is that it's kind of understandable that you would get anxious in those situations, because a lot of people would. 

00:05:20
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:20
FRANK WILLS But what about other situations? Does this crop up elsewhere? 

00:05:25
JAN GRAY Well, I think what's happened is since I had became aware of doing these presentations and, and, and doing this, it's actually spilling over now into other areas. For example, I've got a function to go to on Monday evening with my husband, this is sort of business function, and I really don't, I don't want to go. 

00:05:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:50
JAN GRAY I don't want to go at all. 

00:05:50
FRANK WILLS Alright. 

00:05:50
JAN GRAY In fact, you know I would, I have actually said I, I, you know I don't want to go. And you know he is saying it's really important I go, but… 

00:06:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:06:05
JAN GRAY So it's, it's really curtailing my social life now. 

00:06:10
FRANK WILLS And, and am I correct in my understanding that's not a situation where you're required to stand and speak or anything? 

00:06:15
JAN GRAY No, but it, but I'm having to perform I guess is that you know I'm having… 

00:06:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah! Are you the boss' wife or… 

00:06:20
JAN GRAY Sort of. 

00:06:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:06:25
JAN GRAY Although you know, nothing is expected you know, I'm not the boss' wife, so you know that, that it's just I'm having to say the right thing. 

00:06:35
FRANK WILLS And in those kind of situations do you feel that people kind of watching you and… 

00:06:40
JAN GRAY Well, I… 

00:06:40
FRANK WILLS …waiting to see how you'll get? 

00:06:40
JAN GRAY Well, I, I, I, I have the… I'm sure that they're making a judgment and you know it's not the good one. 

00:06:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! What about less formal situations, you know like parties and things like that… 

00:06:55
JAN GRAY Oh, I've been to all those. 

00:06:55
FRANK WILLS …you know dinner parties and things like that? 

00:06:55
JAN GRAY Oh, dinner parties! See actually those have got fewer recently. 

00:07:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:05
JAN GRAY And I'm happy as to, if it's in my house I can be in the kitchen, so I don't actually have to be in there with everyone. 

00:07:15
FRANK WILLS And, and what about going into you know cafes and pubs and? 

00:07:20
JAN GRAY Ah… Well I, I, it's… I mean a pub, I wouldn't go into a pub. And… 

00:07:30
FRANK WILLS Because? 

00:07:30
JAN GRAY Um… Because I just… I just feel not to do. I would, I wouldn't know what to order, I wouldn't know, you know, I just wouldn't know how to do. 

00:07:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… What about if you're with your husband or a friend or something? 

00:07:55
JAN GRAY I just… Again I've got a picture of me standing there looking stupid. 

00:08:00
FRANK WILLS So, so what this feels like is you know say it occurs, these kind of things similar things occur over… 

00:08:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:08:10
FRANK WILLS …few different situations. 

00:08:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:08:10
FRANK WILLS Ah… But what seems to be common about them is that they're situations where other people might be around kind of looking at you and… 

00:08:25
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:25
FRANK WILLS …thinking, whatever they're thinking about you. 

00:08:25
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:30
FRANK WILLS And what goes along with that for you is a kind of sense of self-consciousness. 

00:08:35
JAN GRAY Hmm… Yeah, looking a fool. 

00:08:35
FRANK WILLS Fear… A fear of… 

00:08:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… Being stupid. 

00:08:40
FRANK WILLS …being, being stupid. 

00:08:40
JAN GRAY Being laughed at. 

00:08:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, okay. 

00:08:45
MIKE SIMMONS Alright! So, so what would you see as a baseline here? 

00:08:50
FRANK WILLS Well, it's really what we are seeing about what the client's describing is how this problem is spreading to lots of different areas and so what we want to see in terms of improvement is it's starting to narrow again and… 

00:09:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:09:05
FRANK WILLS …possibly you know, being no major situations. 

00:09:10
MIKE SIMMONS Alright, and we're already seeing some themes coming out as Jan talks on we(ph). 

00:09:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, that's right because we are in the area of social anxiety, we are pretty certain about that now. And we know from the research into that that there are certain definite cognitive themes which seem to underlie the thinking of people who are prone to social anxiety, which are things like you know fearing the judgments that other people make of us and then feeling very self-conscious about it. So they often, often turn around their achievements and work situations where one is seen to be doing well or not well. And I think we should just have a look and see these come up. 

00:10:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:10:00
Assessment (b) – from the first session 

00:10:00
JAN GRAY Actually thinking about it is probably nearly a year ago. 

00:10:05
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright! And what was happening then? 

00:10:10
JAN GRAY Ah, well I wasn't so busy. I was… It was holiday. It was the summer. And I wasn't so busy really. 

00:10:15
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright! So it does worth play a big part in this then? 

00:10:20
JAN GRAY I think, I think workplace is probably the biggest part in it really. 

00:10:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Do you want to tell me a bit about your work? 

00:10:30
JAN GRAY Ah, yeah, well I suppose what it is I, I, I get to meet a lot of people and I think what happens is that the reason why I'm waking up early in the morning is because I feel very nervous about meeting the people. 

00:10:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:45
JAN GRAY And you know, it gets to the point where really, you know I would almost do anything but not to have to go out and meet the people I'm working with. It's okay once you know, I'm there at the end of the day and, but it's every morning, it's thinking I'm gonna have to do this again. 

00:11:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, alright. 

00:11:05
JAN GRAY And have to do this again. 

00:11:05
FRANK WILLS So it's kind of almost like an apprehension building up before you get to sleep? 

00:11:10
JAN GRAY Well, yes, I mean yes. I mean in the nighttime the thoughts you know, I'm just sort of thinking about all the things I got wrong the day before all the you know, the things I could have said and should have said and, and then by the time the morning comes I really feel really, really nervous. 

00:11:35
FRANK WILLS Alright! So it sounds like in a way what happens sometimes is that you, you have a bit of a postmortem on the day, afterwards… 

00:11:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:11:45
FRANK WILLS …think over all the things you could have done? 

00:11:45
JAN GRAY Absolutely, yeah, yeah. And even if I can almost feel myself relaxing and then it's almost as if my brain says to me no, no, no there are some thoughts there and, and almost hunts them out. 

00:12:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:12:00
JAN GRAY It hunts out the sort of the, the sort of the things the I did wrong. 

00:12:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and so that it would, a pattern of worry is that that's what happens, the worrying kind of seeks out. 

00:12:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:12:15
FRANK WILLS Worry eases your mind. 

00:12:15
JAN GRAY Absolutely. 

00:12:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:12:15
JAN GRAY It's almost as if it is a magnet, yeah. 

00:12:20
FRANK WILLS And, and what kind of job, work is that you do? 

00:12:25
JAN GRAY What kind of job? 

00:12:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:12:25
JAN GRAY Well, I'm, I'm actually sort of in sales. 

00:12:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
JAN GRAY So I have to go and, sort of do a lot of presentations to people, a lot of public speaking to groups. 

00:12:40
FRANK WILLS Alright! And when you have to kind of sell them an idea or… 

00:12:45
JAN GRAY That's right. 

00:12:45
FRANK WILLS …or a product of something. 

00:12:45
JAN GRAY That's right. 

00:12:45
FRANK WILLS Or something like that. 

00:12:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:12:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and have you been given any, any training to, to do this? 

00:12:55
JAN GRAY Well, not specifically, I'm sort of worked out through the rings and I suppose what happened was last September I, I got promoted. 

00:13:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:05
JAN GRAY And you know part of my job you know, obviously meant that the clients I was working with were, were more prestigious and so that there is more risk when I go out and see people… 

00:13:15
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:13:15
JAN GRAY …there is more risk. 

00:13:20
FRANK WILLS And… So, so you were kind of picked out in a way and some confidence was expressed in you to do this? 

00:13:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah! So, so what did they tell you to and do you know? 

00:13:35
JAN GRAY Well, they just said that I was, you know that, that, that I was doing a good job and they liked the way I was working and I had got some good clients on board and they, they just you know thought I could do bigger and better things. 

00:13:50
FRANK WILLS Alright! So they said to you go and do more of what you are doing. But, but with… 

00:13:55
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose they did really… 

00:13:55
FRANK WILLS …bigger, bigger… 

00:13:55
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah but it doesn't… 

00:14:00
FRANK WILLS …targets(ph)… 

00:14:00
JAN GRAY It doesn't feel the same. 

00:14:00
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:14:00
JAN GRAY It feels different now. 

00:14:00
FRANK WILLS It feels like you've moved beyond what was… 

00:14:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:14:05
FRANK WILLS What you were able to do. Were you, were you comfortable before and they… 

00:14:10
JAN GRAY Um, I always get nervous. 

00:14:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:10
JAN GRAY But it, it not as bad as I have, I have become now. 

00:14:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and would that sometimes mean that you know, you're up against someone else who is trying to sell a product as it were. 

00:14:25
JAN GRAY Um, not that so much, because I think we're the only company selling the product we're selling, but I'm very aware that the people I'm speaking to are much cleaver than me, much more knowledgeable, much more experienced and that, that I'm gonna look a fool basically. 

00:14:45
FRANK WILLS So you see the people that you are talking to… 

00:14:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:14:50
FRANK WILLS …as being on another level in a way? 

00:14:55
JAN GRAY Oh, they are! They are, I mean you know professors and doctors and, you know they, they talk a language I, I you know barely can understand a lot of the time. 

00:15:05
FRANK WILLS So it really feels like you are on a kind of a sticky wicket as it were you know hostile situation? 

00:15:10
JAN GRAY Well, I have got this sort of picture in my head of, of turning up to give a presentation and being asked a question that I just can't answer and I've got this picture in my head of just standing there openmouthed, I'm not being able to speak and being laughed at. 

00:15:40
FRANK WILLS Has that actually ever happened? 

00:15:45
JAY GRAY Not, not in a situation like that no. 

00:15:45
MIKE SIMMONS So she has a postmortem every night on her day? 

00:15:50
FRANK WILLS Yes, it seems to be something that people who get various type of anxiety seem to do that is you know something difficult happens to them and then most people kind of able to just let it go and not think about it but people with a problem in that area tend to kind of obsessively go over and over and over and get more and more wound up and upset about it, reproducing it in their imagination, often in a far worst form than what actually did happen. 

00:16:25
MIKE SIMMONS And what was interesting was she was also talking about looking for something that might be wrong. She said like a magnet or something, looking for something to cause concern. 

00:16:35
FRANK WILLS Yes, it does seem actually that part of the problem with this is that people almost have a kind of overactive brain you know that must seek out the problem and can't just let it go and, and I mean we increasingly think that it's not just the, the content of thought that is that can be difficult but it's the way people pay attention to it. 

00:17:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:17:05
FRANK WILLS You know most people they have a negative thought are able to kind of let it go at least after a while, but people with these negative, anxious, worrying patterns often almost like a dog with a bone you know, how they keep on worrying… 

00:17:20
MIKE SIMMONS It was thinking of a terrier. 

00:17:20
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:17:20
MIKE SIMMONS Just how endlessly going back to it. 

00:17:20
FRANK WILLS …and because of that. 

00:17:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes and can't ignore that. 

00:17:25
FRANK WILLS Yes, that's right. 

00:17:25
MIKE SIMMONS It's always that she is talking about a work issue, but of course this could be any kind of issue that would create this kind of problem. 

00:17:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah and it is, it is a really interesting thing in social anxiety because ah, some people experience it at work, and some people don't experience it at work. I had one client who experienced it very strongly around bosses, you now and then I had a second client the same week actually with a similar sort of problem and I said, I suppose you feel this with your boss, and he said, oh no, not at all because I know exactly what I'm supposed to do with my boss, it's slightly informal chats over coffee that I can't handle. 

00:18:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:18:15
FRANK WILLS So it really does vary from person to person. 

00:18:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:18:15
FRANK WILLS And that's why we must always be wary of over-applying our theory, because we also need to know exactly how it works out with that particular person that you are with. 

00:18:25
MIKE SIMMONS With that person? 

00:18:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:18:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:18:25
FRANK WILLS The other individual person, yeah. 

00:18:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, alright. 

00:18:30
FRANK WILLS So there are general tendencies, but the way they all show themselves in individual be usually quite unique. 

00:18:35
MIKE SIMMONS But at the moment what you are doing is actually getting a sentence of the uniqueness of this client's experience. 

00:18:40
FRANK WILLS Yes, very exactly, yes. 

00:18:40
MIKE SIMMONS And that's what's going on in the assessment. 

00:18:45
FRANK WILLS That's what I'm trying to do. 

00:18:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:18:45
FRANK WILLS Assessment is usually really helped by getting one or two very specific situations in which the clients had a very negative reaction and then going into in fine detail what was going through her mind and how she was behaving and what she was feeling and trying to trace that and what we call a vicious cycle that seems to operate in, in that situation. 

00:19:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay and so what main(ph) the therapist hopeful. 

00:19:15
FRANK WILLS Well, you will see that we, we actually draw this out and what we are trying to give is ah, a client an understanding of their pattern which is just automatic really to them to begin with. And we are tying to help them to be able to step back from that experience more and understand the different elements of it which allows then some rethinking of the, the different elements. 

00:19:40
MIKE SIMMONS So is this something about an unconscious process, becoming more conscious, the client having a conscious awareness of what goes on in a situation? 

00:19:50
FRANK WILLS That's right. Yes, it's over them. It's… I mean that called negative automatic thoughts, because they are so automatic you know, they, they just come without conscious awareness often. So brining them into awareness allows them to be reflected on a reformulated and ah, you probably have the expression reframed you know, they are having a second look at the, the meaning of the thoughts and how accurate they are. 

00:20:20
MIKE SIMMONS And think about the kind of person assessing is like, oh, that's just like me or I always get it wrong or sending(ph) me those kind of, that kind of narratives that's going on ah, the, the client or a person just sees it's being everyday to them. 

00:20:35
FRANK WILLS Well, that's right. I mean, it seems all of us have this continuum narrative all the time and most of the time it's about minor things, but if we start, if there starts to be a very negative flavor to it we'll effectively got a sort of negative mood music playing through your head… 

00:20:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:20:50
FRANK WILLS …the whole time and as you know mood music affects your mood so. 

00:20:55
MIKE SIMMONS I guess that the bid just to kind of label this a little, I guess almost all of us have the experience being in a situation in a large group of people, perhaps at conference, something like that, where we think we might speak to the group. 

00:21:15
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:21:15
MIKE SIMMONS And for me and many other people I've spoken to a dialog style starts, am I gonna speak, will I speak or maybe a ah, that kind of think you know. 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah. 

00:21:25
MIKE SIMMONS That's a negative message going on… 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:21:25
MIKE SIMMONS …in life all the time. 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:21:25
MIKE SIMMONS That's gonna be extremely uncomfortable. 

00:21:30
FRANK WILLS Yes and in a way, I mean lot of that goes on semiconsciously as it were, but the more you are aware of what the thoughts are then the more you start to have a choice… 

00:21:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:21:45
FRANK WILLS …about what you can do, if you are not even aware then you obviously don't, don't have the choice of doing anything different. You know and, and sometimes I, I would actually reduce CBT to two phrases which is thinking something different, doing something different. 

00:22:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

00:22:00
FRANK WILLS Well, it can't be as simple as that. 

00:22:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, shall we go on? 

00:22:05
FRANK WILLS Yes.

JAN GRAY It was in that lecture theater and it was a lunchtime lecture, and I really wasn't feeling very well anyway that day, sort of physically I wasn't feeling well. And we were having to give a lecture using PowerPoint and I, I'm not very conversant with PowerPoint. 

00:22:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:25
JAN GRAY And so it came for my turn to, to get up there. So I was already thinking you know, they're gonna see that I don't know how to use the PowerPoint. And I was starting to, to give my talk and I was talking about my product and, and most of the people in the audience, I don't think it was their area of interest, because I could see… 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:22:50
JAN GRAY …that they were looking fairly bored. 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:55
JAN GRAY And I could see there were people sort of talking to each other at the back and which sort of made me lose my concentration a bit. And as I lost my concentration, it was really hard to start talking again. It's as if, you know, it's as if I totally lost my thread. 

00:23:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:15
JAN GRAY And so I just stood there and I could then see them getting even more bored and even more, you know aggravated with me and so I just sort of wound up really quickly and, and sort of made my exit. And it was awful. 

00:23:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:35
JAN GRAY It was awful. 

00:23:35
FRANK WILLS Alright! It sounds like it was kind of you felt embarrassed and? 

00:23:40
JAN GRAY It was, it was awful and I'm sure that they will never, ever, ever ask me back again. 

00:23:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Okay! I mean, do you mind if we, we just, as I say put that a under microscope… 

00:23:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:23:50
FRANK WILLS …just a little bit, can you sort of get back there? You know, can we… 

00:23:55
JAN GRAY Oh, yes. 

00:23:55
FRANK WILLS …you know can you just sort of, what was ah, I want to try and encourage you to speak in the present tense for a moment, you know you are there back in the classroom, but what you are wearing? 

00:24:05
JAN GRAY What am I wearing? 

00:24:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:24:10
JAN GRAY Well I'm wearing my presentation suit, because I'm wearing sort of trouser suit, sort of fairly dark colors, quite smart. But I, I'm, I'm not feeling my best because of so… I'm not feeling very well. I had an upset stomach because my stomach is not… 

00:24:30
FRANK WILLS Sort of rumbling a bit. 

00:24:30
JAN GRAY Rumbling a bit and I'm actually in quite a bit of pain and… 

00:24:35
FRANK WILLS And, and what you see in the room? 

00:24:35
JAN GRAY What I see in the room? Just tears of people sitting in front of me and they haven't dimmed the light, so I can't see them all. And they are in the white coats and they've got the stethoscopes, so I know they are doctors. So I know they are clever than me and they are just, they have had a presentation by you know, my colleague which I have to say it was quite boring. So already they are fairly sort of bored. 

00:25:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:25:05
JAN GRAY And I know that the product I'm talking about is something that they don't know so I can see that they are, some of them are sort of switched off, and some of them are sort of talking to each other and looking down and… 

00:25:25
FRANK WILLS Alright. Now, do you remember when I briefly introduced you to cognitive therapy when we were taking in the phone. And I mentioned this idea about negative thoughts. 

00:25:35
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS I'm just wondering what the thoughts that were going through your mind were… 

00:25:40
JAN GRAY Well! 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS You mean kind of… 

00:25:45
JAN GRAY They are not listening to me. 

00:25:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! And they are bored> 

00:25:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, they're bored. 

00:25:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:25:50
JAN GRAY I'm not making any sense here. 

00:25:55
FRANK WILLS And they're cleverer than you? 

00:25:55
JAN GRAY Yeah they are cleverer than me. Yeah umm… Yeah I think those were the main sort of, I feel a fool. 

00:26:05
FRANK WILLS Just… Just… Just one interesting thing you said that was you said that your, your colleague hadn't done a very good presentation. 

00:26:15
JAN GRAY No. 

00:26:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah so… 

00:26:15
JAN GRAY But he is a doctor. 

00:26:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah so what's the significance of that? 

00:26:20
JAN GRAY But he is cleverer than me. 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:26:25
JAN GRAY He is, you know he is… 

00:26:30
FRANK WILLS But he, but he hasn't tell the interest of the audience even though he is clever. 

00:26:35
JAN GRAY No. 

00:26:35
FRANK WILLS Alright! So, so and that tells us something, doesn't it… Doesn't that tell us something? 

00:26:40
JAN GRAY Well either he is an incredibly boring speaker or they're fairly sort of, sort of rude group, I suppose. 

00:26:55
FRANK WILLS Umm… I might calling, using they might be a typical(ph) group. But does it perhaps tell us you know that being… Does it tell that being clever means you'll interest people? 

00:27:05
JAN GRAY Not really I suppose. It doesn't really does it? No actually it doesn't. Umm… Some of the best speakers I've heard have not been particularly technical. 

00:27:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay! So, so that's one negative thought we might want to review then about this thing about whether you know you are not as cleverer as them. 

00:27:25
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:27:25
FRANK WILLS I mean but we, we'll be looking more there what the, the meaning of that was. In this context it seems to be, the negative thought seems to be that because you're not cleverer, clever as them may be, question mark, inverted commas, we don't know that for sure… 

00:27:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:27:45
FRANK WILLS …that you won't be able to interest them. 

00:27:50
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:27:50
FRANK WILLS But that seems a big question based on them. 

00:27:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:27:55
FRANK WILLS The, the instant of your colleague's presentation. 

00:27:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:28:00
MIKE SIMMONS So you're actually Jan quite a lot of information, quite a lot to think about here? 

00:28:05
FRANK WILLS Yes and the information is primarily designed to promote strategies for change. And I mentioned before that a lot of the focus for the strategies are, is on present time experience. But we're also interested in historical experience, particularly as it throws light on current experience. 

00:28:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:28:25
FRANK WILLS And we're very interested in, in the kind of core believes develop from the client's history and very often they reflect very much in the negative automatic thoughts that the client is having now. 

00:28:40
MIKE SIMMONS Negative automatic thoughts? 

00:28:45
FRANK WILLS Well, yes… Well perhaps I do it the other way around, if a client might develop a core belief which is that I'm not likeable. And that kind of applies across many, many different situations. But in their ongoing life situation they're much more like to think, oh this person I'm talking to now doesn't like me. So a negative automatic thought is usually very situation specific, whereas negative core believes and assumptions, dysfunctional assumptions are about much broader ranges of experience. 

00:29:25
MIKE SIMMONS So we're going back what we were talking about earlier this voice in the air that's always delivering a bit bad news to us. 

00:29:30
FRANK WILLS That's correct. Yeah and that, that part of that is a reaction to what's going on now, but part of it might also carry echoes of past experience. And sometimes the past experience can kind of contaminates the current experience, so actually in reality there is no issue with this person. 

00:29:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:29:50
FRANK WILLS But your history is kind of telling you there might be. 

00:29:55
MIKE SIMMONS And moving from might be there is and saw response to that rather than we guys… 

00:30:00
FRANK WILLS …safest thing sometimes do… 

00:30:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes of course… Okay. So on with the next clip? 

00:30:05
FRANK WILLS We certainly will do that. 

00:30:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:30:05
Formulation (a) - from the first session 

00:30:10
JAN GRAY I have in some ways, because I think when I'm feeling really bad in front of a group, it sort of reminds me of when I was little and because I was the youngest child and youngest quite a bit to my sister. 

00:30:35
FRANK WILLS Was a gap? 

00:30:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:30:35
FRANK WILLS Of, of how many? 

00:30:35
JAN GRAY Seven years and, and four years with my brother, so I was the baby. And whenever I used to say anything, you know Sunday dinner or you know sitting around the lunch or when I'd like to say anything I, I'd sort of be sort of ignored basically. 

00:31:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:00
JAN GRAY Or tell don't be silly. 

00:31:00
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

00:31:05
JAN GRAY Or you know, you know for goodness sake. 

00:31:05
FRANK WILLS Umm… It was kind of how to get your voice heard? 

00:31:10
JAN GRAY Very much so, yeah. And I suppose when you think about it, if you're three years old you know, when you're taking as a 3-year-old to a 10-year-old you know, you know don't have a lot in common. 

00:31:20
FRANK WILLS How do you get on with your mum and dad now? 

00:31:25
JAN GRAY Now alright, at the time not, not, not particularly when you know it's taking into my 40's actually. 

00:31:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah! I don't know if this is right, but I got a slight sense of them having to deal with all this stuff with your brother and sister and then when you came along they kind of run of energy or something… 

00:31:45
JAN GRAY What they did? 

00:31:45
FRANK WILLS …you're, you're expected to run yourself? 

00:31:50
JAN GRAY Do you know that's absolutely yes. I mean because my sister had, had problems in her teenage, so they were very, you know there was lot of focus on my sister. And my brother because… Actually I think it's because he had an accident when he was, when he was a little boy and he, he fractured his skull and he had a long time in hospital and so he was also very carefully treated. 

00:32:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:15
JAN GRAY And I think yes by the time they got to me they had run out of energy, ran out of steam. 

00:32:20
FRANK WILLS And that they were quite a bit older by that point as well? 

00:32:25
JAN GRAY That was right yeah. So it was you know, I was… 

00:32:25
FRANK WILLS Bit unfair? 

00:32:30
JAN GRAY Yes, yes. 

00:32:30
FRANK WILLS A lot unfair may be I think? 

00:32:30
JAN GRAY Yeah I think it was, I think it was, I think it was. I don't think I got a lot of positive acknowledgement. You know that, that there was lot of assumptions made about me achieving, but no acknowledgment of how hard I had to try. 

00:32:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… Yeah. And I'm just kind of thinking then that so, so if we kind of put that together then you know that in some ways in the, in the sibling grove was quite competitive by the sound of it? 

00:33:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, still is. 

00:33:10
FRANK WILLS And, and you were at the bottom of the hierarchy in age and… 

00:33:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:33:15
FRANK WILLS …in your perception at least in some other attributes as well? 

00:33:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, still is. 

00:33:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:33:20
JAN GRAY Still is. 

00:33:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah! And somehow or other although your mum and dad you know you wouldn't, wouldn't say they were bad parents, I don't think reading between the lines a bit, but somehow they kind of neglected to give you some, some things that perhaps they could given you and… 

00:33:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:33:40
FRANK WILLS …and you are kind of expected to run yourself? 

00:33:45
JAN GRAY Well it was, it was actually, I mean, it was implicit in childhood, but now my parents are a bit older. They've made it explicit that, that my mum or my brother, you know my brother was my mum's favorite and my sister was daddy's girl and you know and, and what about me you know. 

00:34:00
FRANK WILLS Nobody is saying that. 

00:34:05
JAN GRAY That's right and, and you know that's something that you know… 

00:34:10
FRANK WILLS Still is there? 

00:34:10
JAN GRAY Less so no but, but to an extent, to an extent. 

00:34:15
FRANK WILLS You know in cognitive therapy, one of the things we look at is you know how people develop core believes about life. You know about themselves and about other people coming out of these experiences would you, can you hesitate a guess or any call… 

00:34:35
JAN GRAY Oh yeah, yeah well I'm not lovable. 

00:34:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:40
JAN GRAY And I'm not good enough. 

00:34:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… And other people? 

00:34:45
JAN GRAY Are better than me. 

00:34:50
FRANK WILLS And what about… Are other people helpful? 

00:34:50
JAN GRAY No. 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah! A kind of… 

00:34:55
JAN GRAY Oh that's really… 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:55
JAN GRAY Really… 

00:35:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah I can your feeling. 

00:35:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:35:00
FRANK WILLS There is some stuff here, you are cater(ph), stay, stay with this. 

00:35:05
JAN GRAY Yeah I mean that's… I've never thought of that but that's, that's true, yes, because one of my sort of, sort of bruise(ph) I set myself as you know I don't expect anybody to do anything, I've to do it myself. 

00:35:20
FRANK WILLS And I wonder if that does come up you know when you're with a crowd of people you know that's in a way you don't really expect anyone to feel sympathetic would you? 

00:35:30
JAN GRAY Well no quite the opposite, actually I expect them to be antagonist. Yeah, I expect them not to like me. 

00:35:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! And you now look, looking back at that, you know one of the brilliant things about children is that they you know how, I mean that's a quite a good way of dealing with that kind of situation to, to believe those things because it was essentially true, you know that other people aren't helping me much here. 

00:36:00
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:36:00
FRANK WILLS Other people are being you know thinking themselves better than me. 

00:36:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:36:05
FRANK WILLS It did actually make sense? 

00:36:05
JAN GRAY Yeah absolutely. 

00:36:10
FRANK WILLS You know but I guess one of the problems is though that sometimes those believes stick around to later points in life when maybe they're not quite so useful and accurate anymore. 

00:36:20
JAN GRAY Well yes I can understand… 

00:36:25
MIKE SIMMONS So what are you working on here? 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS Well you, you've probably seen in the previous extract we, we've been mainly focusing on the client's problems and symptoms in the here and now, but CBT therapists are also interested in a more historical look at where and whether there are links with these current problems in the past experience. And here we've just been you know exploring a part of the, the client's history. There's an awful lot more actually which we couldn't include but the idea is build the full conceptualization which is able to link up events that happened in the past and, and with events happening in the present now so we can understand the different forces of play. 

00:37:10
MIKE SIMMONS So this is quite interesting because I often hear CBT is spoken off as if it's not interested in past experience and actually this is belying that. 

00:37:20
FRANK WILLS Yes well I think there is two things to say about that is that I think CBT has always been interested in the clients' learning history. But I think may be in the initial phases of CBT there was the strong emphasis on tackling the current problems in a way to differentiate it from other types of therapies such as the psychoanalysis. We're kind of saying well this is something new, but in actual what happened is that has the theories developed, it's actually developed in a way a much stronger interest in, in historical material that seems to be in all the current writing now. So but it's the two things working together, I don't think we're interested in history for history sake it's, it's trying to understand how those past history must you know may be impacting on what the client's experiencing now. 

00:38:15
MIKE SIMMONS So it's a kind of live in me. 

00:38:20
FRANK WILLS Yes I mean for example you know a client might have developed very good reason for not trusting people from say of early abusive childhood. And it seems that that learning kind of stays in there somewhere so they might now currently be not trusting somebody, but the influence of the past experience might also be part of that current experience in understanding how those things fit together which is you know the key, the key understanding that comes from formulating the problem and, and deciding how to you know try to intervene to change things. 

00:39:00
Formulation (b) from the first session 

00:39:00
FRANK WILLS You know I think now we've got this map bit more sorted out. You know the, this problem area makes a lot more sense in the sense that we can see some of the, how it does relate that of previous things. And we can also very much emphasize with you because we all know how hard it is to my presentations. So in a way you're, you're trying to do quite a hard thing with over the bit of the handicap of a some bad memories of that kind of stuff you know. 

00:39:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:39:35
 So, so you know one of things about mapping it out like this because it's like a vicious cycle we can start to look at what bits we can change. And if we succeed in changing any bits of it usually it does you know have a more positive effect. So for example we could get you of think about how you think about these situations and we could perhaps try to develop some antidotes to these kind of negative thinking. 

00:40:05
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:40:05
FRANK WILLS You know, we could look at whether you could train yourself not to kind of be thrown by and still hurrying up and so forth. And we can also just deal with you know how you can look after your bad feelings. You know how you can soothe yourself when you're feeling anxious. Most people have different ways they can, they can do that. And we can also talk about some of this historical you know things that have happened to you, because we've only just briefly touched on it. 

00:40:40
MIKE SIMMONS So where we got you so far? 

00:40:40
FRANK WILLS Okay well we've, we've seen the assessment appeasing together examples of the client's current problems, difficulties and symptoms. We've also… We've seen the assessment looking at may be previous historical things that happened to client. And we've been putting them together into a formulation and, and we, we'll give the, the actual written formulation within the booklet that goes with this DVD. But also remember the points I made right at the start, all this has been happening within a therapeutic relationship. So, I think it's time to think about that for a moment. Actually the, the therapeutic relationship within CBT is characterized as being collaborative. And in this next extract, I'm discussing the notion of collaboration with the client. 

00:41:35
Therapeutic alliance - from the first session 

00:41:40
FRANK WILLS Well I mean you know one of the things about this that I sort of believe is that if we're going to be working together we'll become a sort of a team you know so you'll be by yourself in this, there will be someone on your team with you. 

00:41:55
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:41:55
FRANK WILLS To try to help you out. I mean I sometimes I have used the analogy, I don't know if whether this one work with you or not, but you might do as you know we reach maximum, is that you know, you know like in a boxing match where at the end of the, an end of the each round the boxer comes sits down, somebody comes up and gives him some swig of water and mops him, hit him that. I want you can do that sort of thing, off you go. 

00:42:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:42:20
FRANK WILLS I feel a bit like that sometimes. 

00:42:25
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:42:25
FRANK WILLS Would you like to have some of that going? 

00:42:25
JAN GRAY You are not kidding. I've actually liked you there with me. 

00:42:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:30
JAN GRAY I actually liked you there in front of me. 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS Umm…umm… Well we can talk about exactly what I might be able to do and you know there are sort of, there are, there is no limit really. So, so, so it's a plan that we, we, we might come up with both. 

00:42:45
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:42:50
FRANK WILLS But you know I guess it would be mainly orientated towards helping you to stand up and be confident, but to feel that you've some backing-in in doing that. 

00:43:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:43:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:43:00
JAN GRAY Yeah it sounds good idea. 

00:43:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay so there is a lot going on there, interesting ideas. A team, working together as a team, you as Jan II in her corner in some way. So it's kind of some clear collaborative work going on. 

00:43:20
FRANK WILLS Yes, of course the word collaboration means literally working together, it doesn't necessarily meaning you're doing the same task. I mean I'm, I'm doing my therapist task and the client's doing their client task and neither task mean anything without the other party you know do, do, doing a parallel task that's where the, the, the, the collaboration comes literally together. But you know it's important also that, it is a working alliance you know you are there to try and achieve certain ends. And so having got on a relationship kind of established and beginning to develop a formulation we can now begin to develop the strategies that will be and form the interventions that impact on the, on the formulation. 

00:44:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right and we will see that in, in the next clip. I'm just conscious that there was something for her when you referred to being her corner. She, she actually felt very good about that. You could see her expression, but I think what she also suggested was that she'd like would you to be in front of her. And that feels like a very different thing. 

00:44:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:40
MIKE SIMMONS She is out there being her. You're not protecting her from that, but you're helping her to work with. 

00:44:45
FRANK WILLS Right, yes I mean I sort of politely, politely offered and went into the corner to, to back her up from there. 

00:44:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah! Can you just clarify for me a moment the difference between a formulation and the conceptualization, because these are both terms I've heard at different times? 

00:45:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I'm glad you raised that, in fact there's absolutely no difference between the two terms. And it's just that in my original writings and I think at the time of the we made the tape, I did use the word conceptualization. But I've since come to the, the stance that actually formulation is a better term only because it's used in lots of other different therapies as well that term. So in a way it helps us therapists to realize that when we doing you know what are called common factors in therapy you know there are things that we do the same. We might do them slightly differently but the activity essentially the same. 

00:45:45
MIKE SIMMONS So there is a commonality of understanding. 

00:45:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and the purpose of them is to, to drive strategies you know for the therapy. And you know there are various kind of principles which underlie the strategies of CBT, which have a big influence on the sort of things you do. For example, there is the general preference towards a shorter rather than longer term therapy although that's a matter of judgment. You know there might be some clients who would do longer time therapy with. But the fact that we mainly try and to do it at the shorter term means that we, we have limited time to do some things so that it influences a sort of things that you would do. It also means that you later use homework to take advantage of the time between the sessions. 

00:46:35
MIKE SIMMONS So the work is ongoing all the time. It's not just the hour with the therapist but they are going away with homework… 

00:46:40
JAN GRAY Not exactly the way we hope that the client's life isn't the hour with the therapist… 

00:46:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes! 

00:46:45
FRANK WILLS …this all… all the stuff. And the short term thing also means that we, we regard ourselves as having you know somewhat of an educational task with the client to, to tell them you know what we know from our research about the type of things that happened when you've things like social anxiety or depression. Of course the actual, their experience will be individual. But there are certain commonalities which are useful for them to know like for example when you're depressed, your concentration suffers. And, and a lot of people would then I can't concentrate and they're beginning themselves a bad person(ph), but in fact it is just a simple depression so it is nothing about them as a person. 

00:47:35
MIKE SIMMONS I mean I'm, I'm just thinking about clients' experiencing bereavement, who are often reassured to know that it is pretty common to feel like you're losing your mind. 

00:47:45
FRANK WILLS It seems… Yeah, exactly that's a very good parallel and it seems to be very early step in, in many different types of therapy actually. 

00:47:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:47:55
FRANK WILLS So again a common factor perhaps. 

00:47:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:47:55
FRANK WILLS But here in this extract, I'm, we're just showing me doing a little bit of giving the client information about, about social anxiety it has on people. 

00:48:05
Strategies (a) - from the first session 

00:48:05
FRANK WILLS And, and when you say that you refer to some people not paying attention… 

00:48:10
JAN GRAY Umm…umm… 

00:48:10
FRANK WILLS …can you remember how many people that was? 

00:48:15
JAN GRAY Well I know there was a row at the back. 

00:48:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:48:20
JAN GRAY And there was somebody sitting there and then there were a couple of doctors down at the front there. 

00:48:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah! So you're thinking that three or four people on that. 

00:48:35
JAN GRAY About, about slightly more than that about four or five. 

00:48:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:48:40
FRANK WILLS So four or five people out of 50 were pretty well not paying attention to you? 

00:48:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah! It's just I felt that they were the important people in the room you say? 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! Well you know that we, we're doing now a little bit about, about what happens with this because that there have been some people who're kind of gone into researching this you know and I don't if this fits for you but the, the term that's usually used to describe is social anxiety. 

00:49:20
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:49:20
FRANK WILLS Umm… and you know the… one of the things that seems to go with that is umm… you know that you particularly pay attention to certain things… 

00:49:35
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS …rather than others. 

00:49:35
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS And I… I can very empathize with this by the way, because I… I another part of my work has being as a teacher. 

00:49:45
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:49:45
FRANK WILLS And I know when you're teaching, if you see someone looking out the window you always oh… oh I'm not been very… very interesting. 

00:49:50
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:49:50
FRANK WILLS You know, but sometimes it quite helpful than just to look at the other people, just to check that how many people are engaged… 

00:49:55
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:00
FRANK WILLS Because… because I guess sort of you know any one point in time umm… there's always gonna be a couple of people who aren't engaged with something. 

00:50:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose… I suppose I can see what you're saying. I'm… I suppose it does make sense. 

00:50:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:50:15
JAN GRAY I suppose what happened was that uh… because I saw those people not looking, I… I didn't dare look anyone else because I just thought that they… 

00:50:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:25
JAN GRAY …would also be like that. 

00:50:25
FRANK WILLS And… and that might be something we might have a go changing that, we might and I don't know this… that is quite a big step to take… 

00:50:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS …and we'll do it step-by-step… 

00:50:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS …together on this, but umm… you know would be to in effect to learn how to make yourself look at other people because, if it sounds how the…. other people are doing this, that's a valuable information… 

00:50:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS …that you need to have. 

00:50:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS You know, so and I'm not saying that umm… you know actually everyone can improve their presentation skills, you know so I'm sure that the same applies to you as the same would apply to everyone. But in order to do that, you need to have quite good information, accurate about who is paying attention and who is not paying attention. 

00:51:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:51:10
later in the same session 

00:51:10
JAN GRAY So there is a possibility. 

00:51:15
FRANK WILLS Some, yeah, yeah. And this is one of the things with this kind of situation isn't that… you know you never really tell what people are… 

00:51:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:51:20
FRANK WILLS …thinking and… 

00:51:20
JAN GRAY I mean there was somebody who came up to me at the end and said what I talked to their group. 

00:51:25
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright. So, they obviously had some other perspective on it. 

00:51:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… Yeah, yeah. I hadn't really thought… 

00:51:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:51:30
JAN GRAY …of that actually. 

00:51:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. And… and that again is interesting, I mean you just remember that now… 

00:51:35
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:51:35
FRANK WILLS …because umm… you know going back to what we were saying before, you know about the way and sometimes when you get very nervous or uptight you just seemed to once one(ph), everyone does actually when they're feeling this way, tend to focus on… 

00:51:55
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:55
FRANK WILLS …things that kind of go along with feeling that… 

00:51:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:51:55
FRANK WILLS …and then what you to tend then to exclude these other thing, but also that can work in terms of what you remember about a situation to… 

00:52:05
JAN GRAY Alright. 

00:52:05
FRANK WILLS …you know you can only remember the bad things… 

00:52:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:52:05
FRANK WILLS …and you kind of edit out somehow the, you know the… the… the other things. 

00:52:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. I had forgotten… 

00:52:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:15
JAN GRAY I had forgotten that until we were talking. 

00:52:15
FRANK WILLS And… and remember we were talking before about you… you know kind of doing a sort of postmortem was the little phrase we… 

00:52:25
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:52:25
FRANK WILLS …used to describe it and of course, if you're not remembering properly all the… all the things, if you're excluding some of the more positive things out of it and you're paying more attention to the negative things, then your postmortem is a bit inaccurate as well. 

00:52:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose, it is really isn't that? 

00:52:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:52:45
JAN GRAY …yeah, yeah because I'm already thinking of how bad it was and not that there wasn't… 

00:52:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:50
JAN GRAY …as bad as it. 

00:52:50
FRANK WILLS Okay. So, I mean just… just says for the moment that that perhaps, you know there are some other ways of seeing these situations and… 

00:53:00
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:53:00
FRANK WILLS …sometimes it takes the ability to kind of step outside it a bit, I mean it easier when someone is with you, you know not… 

00:53:05
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:53:05
FRANK WILLS …along with you today help me to do this, but you can actually learn to do that if you are talking a step outside and think what is really going on… 

00:53:15
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:53:15
FRANK WILLS …you know that could be helpful. 

00:53:15
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So, we can still feel kind of educational theme going on here. 

00:53:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, very much so, I think and it's still in that theme that I referred to earlier of helping the under… the client to understand how current experiences can sometimes be contaminated by past experiences. So, somebody might be trying to help you now, but your view of it might be colored by your belief that people don't really wanna help me and therefore, you might misread the person. 

00:53:50
MIKE SIMMONS And assume that they don't want to help. 

00:53:50
FRANK WILLS Exactly yes, yeah. 

00:53:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, right. Okay. So, where are we now? 

00:53:55
FRANK WILLS Well, we're just reviewing the strategic principles and this one final one that I would like to umm… illustrate and discuss and that is the principle of structure in… in… in umm… cognitive therapy. 

00:54:10
MIKE SIMMONS And… and why is structure important? 

00:54:10
FRANK WILLS Well, the… the several… there are several different reasons. One is that umm… I think that's umm… its easy for therapist to assume that clients know the ropes of therapy as it were, but actually for a lots of people they don't… don't really know what to expect. And so, to have that kind of structured approach to it, it helps them know that to which they're coming each week. 

00:54:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:54:35
FRANK WILLS And therefore, settle into therapy, a bit more easily I think. Umm… but it also relates back to the other strategic principle of the short-term focus in order to use a short time period. Well, you have to be quite structured and have various steps in your mind. And… but umm… it's a mistake though to think that its all very umm… step one, step two, step three, step four because the structure is… is also partly in the therapist mind. I mean you… you'll have heard of her and back(ph) it was pretty well, I think the founder of this particular approach. And when you watch him, at first it doesn't look like he is very structured at all, it seems to be rambling all over the place. But when actually examine the thought processes that behind each move as he makes, you can see there is a definite structure and a way that he is trying to work through that process of assessment formulation and intervention I mentioned earlier. 

00:55:35
MIKE SIMMONS So that will always be an awareness of the structure in the therapist way of, maybe more or less apparent within the therapy rule. 

00:55:45
FRANK WILLS Yes, and… and I mean there are some definite steps that you… you take, but within those therapy you can also have a degree of freedom. For example, you set an agenda always at the start of therapy and… and you review homework and then towards the end of the therapy you set new homework and umm… have a feedback and from the client about the session. So those things are always there, but within that structure that's got a lot freedom from and moving in different directions. 

00:56:15
MIKE SIMMONS And this next extract demonstrates so agenda being set. 

00:56:20
FRANK WILLS Hopefully that's the case. 

00:56:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:56:25
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:56:25
Strategies (b) from the second session 

00:56:25
FRANK WILLS Okay. So you… so you've had a fairly busy and… and, I mean quite testing week then. 

00:56:30
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:56:30
FRANK WILLS And the symptoms have been you know troubling in some of the areas, but not so much you know there's so… 

00:56:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:56:35
FRANK WILLS …it sounds like you know we've done quite a good job of trying to manage it a bit at least. 

00:56:40
JAN GRAY Umm… I think I remembered a lot of the things that we talked about in the session. Umm… and I tried really hard ah… ah… especially giving the presentation, I tried really hard to look at… at all the audience, you know all the delicates. And that… that was a bit helpful, at of all the three things I did actually that was… that was the best this… this week I… I… I felt. 

00:57:10
FRANK WILLS The presentation. 

00:57:10
JAN GRAY I felt better this week because of that that really helped. I'm not saying it was great… 

00:57:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:15
JAN GRAY …but umm… compared during the past and actually compared to my appraisal umm… it… it was I mean they were the worst this week. 

00:57:25
FRANK WILLS Okay. So… so those might be quite good things to put on our agenda and… 

00:57:30
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:57:30
FRANK WILLS …you know I'm using the word agenda because… 

00:57:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, you mentioned that last time we met. 

00:57:35
FRANK WILLS Right, yeah. And because we like to keep it you know a bit structured so that's and we can use the time well really. 

00:57:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:40
FRANK WILLS Umm… and how we usually begin is just that's we all now how you have been over the… 

00:57:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:57:45
FRANK WILLS …over the last week what's been happening. And then we try and set the agenda, the first item usually is to do with the homework that was… 

00:57:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:57:55
FRANK WILLS …from last time, and in this case it was watching the… the tape of the session, which is also a kind of very useful little bridge to our last session. So, lets just did a homework thing and then we'll set the rest of the agenda. 

00:58:10
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:58:10
FRANK WILLS Is… is that okay? 

00:58:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

00:58:15
FRANK WILLS And then towards the end you know we can drawer in umm… you know what… what lessons we maybe learned from this session and set some further homework and then fix a time for next appointment. 

00:58:25
JAN GRAY Okay. Yeah that sounds good. 

00:58:25
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

00:58:30
JAN GRAY Well, I watched it. 

00:58:30
FRANK WILLS Right, yeah. 

00:58:30
JAN GRAY I… I… it was really hard to watch. 

00:58:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:58:35
JAN GRAY …and in fact, I put it often I put off fortune and I sat down the table. Umm… and I only watched it last night umm… and for start it was just really hard to listen to myself and watch myself and… and it… I watched it with my husband because umm… I remember to what he said that, I might need to have somebody to… to tell me and I guess I was missing some thing. 

00:59:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. And umm… how did that work? 

00:59:15
JAN GRAY Well, it worked in two ways actually. One because I think it made him realize quite how serious it is for me… 

00:59:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:59:25
JAN GRAY …so I felt that he for the first time heard how difficult it is for me to go to various functions and how difficult it is for me to do the job I'm doing and so that was helpful and I think it was helpful because he reminded me of some of the things you had said. 

00:59:45
later in the same session 

00:59:50
FRANK WILLS That which we can learn. 

00:59:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:59:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… and it… we all quite near to the end of the session and so we ought to… is that… would… do you feel okay about closing down now? 

01:00:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:00:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. So, and how about… can I make a suggestion for homework? 

01:00:05
JAN GRAY Okay. 

01:00:10
FRANK WILLS Umm… would be to let watch the tape again and to think about this question we just asked, what can we take out of that exercise, you know which might actually make a bit of a difference in the way you and your mom get home now, yeah? 

01:00:25
JAN GRAY Okay. 

01:00:25
FRANK WILLS And the other little bit, so I'll give you two piece of homework… 

01:00:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

01:00:30
FRANK WILLS …if you don't mind and the other one was that umm… you were going to umm… prepared to ask she would say 10 people about what sort of feedback they got from their… their bosses? 

01:00:45
JAN GRAY Yep, I can do that. 

01:00:45
FRANK WILLS And you don't necessarily have to do that before next week, but maybe if you can write down the questions you want to ask them and we can… you know if you have time to do it fine, but if you don't… but and… and really would like to watch the tape. 

01:01:00
JAN GRAY Okay. 

01:01:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I might being to demanding on the other… 

01:01:00
JAN GRAY No, no actually I… no. I think it really helpful towards the tape because we've taught a look about a lot today… 

01:01:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:10
JAN GRAY …and… 

01:01:10
FRANK WILLS Even… even on that show everything we talked about… 

01:01:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:01:10
FRANK WILLS …it feels like some quite important things. 

01:01:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. So, it would be helpful to… to remember what we've… we've talked about. Hmm… 

01:01:20
FRANK WILLS Okay, then… and you remember I said the final bit of the… the structure, the session was to just think about the you know feedback and… and just sort of looking(ph) back and umm… many evaluation, appraisal if you like of the session. Umm… and you know I'm not so much interested in whether it was good or bad, but you know what… what seem to work for you? 

01:01:45
JAN GRAY Umm… I'm surprised how powerful that image was… I'm surprised… 

01:01:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:50
JAN GRAY …how powerfully that affected to how I was feeling here. 

01:01:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:55
JAN GRAY And I think its been helpful just talking over the… the certainly the appraisal situation because again I had forgotten a lot of things, I had been fell too when I was you know remembering I think, so that's been helpful. 

01:02:15
FRANK WILLS Okay. Was there anything that… that you know didn't seem very helpful or I was confusing or I know what you are and… 

01:02:25
JAN GRAY No, I suppose I find it quite hard telling you how I was feeling about you know… about the sessions, but I don't think that was not helpful, I think that was… I think that was… 

01:02:35
FRANK WILLS Just hard to do. 

01:02:40
JAN GRAY Hard to do. 

01:02:40
FRANK WILLS You felt uncomfortable. 

01:02:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:02:40
FRANK WILLS That's brave, yeah. I mean… 

01:02:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:02:40
FRANK WILLS …I appreciate and you don't mistake that now I really want you to… 

01:02:45
JAN GRAY Right. 

01:02:45
FRANK WILLS …keep doing that because that that's what make it work, I mean its interesting that about valuation isn't it, that actually sometimes we do need a little bit in negative evaluation to really up our performance is that people just telling, I mean we do need to hear well done, you know but we also need to hear and this could be a bit clear, this could be a bit better if you would really want to… 

01:03:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:03:10
FRANK WILLS …up our performance that's my thought for today anyway. 

01:03:10
JAN GRAY Yes, yes. I suppose and that's getting the balance isn't it and that's what I'm… I've now got at the moment. 

01:03:20
FRANK WILLS You haven't had in the past, you maybe getting now? 

01:03:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, okay. Yeah. 

01:03:25
FRANK WILLS I mean do you… do you feel… do you feel that's been bit of a shift even in this short-term? Things moving in the right direction. 

01:03:35
JAN GRAY I'm certainly aware of my thoughts a lot more and certainly aware when I'm sort of have letting my thoughts run away with me a lot more. And I think its really remembering myself as a child is interesting. I'm actually been less harsh on my memories and myself as a child. 

01:04:00
FRANK WILLS You had a case in… 

01:04:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, but nobody has ever said that before. 

01:04:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… You had a case and… and its been heard that everyone's in target of that case. 

01:04:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

01:04:15
FRANK WILLS And what feels like it… 

01:04:15
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So short-term focus and educational function, a… a… a present time focus and a clear structure, there the main strategic principles. 

01:04:25
FRANK WILLS That's right Mike, and of course, that strategies umm… are mainly about providing directions that you want to go towards, but they still require and more details and specific skills and techniques and methods to actually implement and umm… what I suggest now is that we… we… we start to look at some of those main methods and skills, which… which fall into two categories really; generally speaking the behavioral skills and the cognitive skills. 

01:05:00
MIKE SIMMONS So, I think I might change how I'm thinking, how am I change what I'm doing. 

01:05:05
FRANK WILLS That's right. Yeah. 

01:05:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, which we're gonna look at first? 

01:05:05
FRANK WILLS The behavioral. And although actually within CBT, a behavioral intervention often has a cognitive aim attached to it as well. 

01:05:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:05:15
FRANK WILLS By which, I mean that you get the client to try something and see whether the way their negative thinking predicts it would turn out is actually the way it will turn out. 

01:05:30
MIKE SIMMONS So, I mean do something and that would be a kind of experiment and as a result of my learning from that experiment I might changes away that I'm thinking. 

01:05:40
FRANK WILLS Yes and you might also change the way you behave, so we have a right attention for a double… double hit that massive work. 

01:05:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. So, I mean just… just coming to my mind ah… my experiment might be going into supermarket and striking up a conversation with the person behind the till rather than standing statically. If they respond to me in a kind of friendly way that they change how I think about how other people see me and they may also change how I behave in future to people. 

01:06:10
FRANK WILLS That's right. That's nice, I say. 

01:06:10
MIKE SIMMONS I guess as long as the supermarket is not too crowded in which case you might want to talk to me anyway. 

01:06:20
FRANK WILLS Right. Well, in a matter of fact actually, one thing that is slightly unusual about CBTs that we do sometimes go out and do things with people and… 

01:06:25
MIKE SIMMONS We've the client. 

01:06:25
FRANK WILLS …yeah, and sometimes people do go into a supermarket and… 

01:06:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:06:30
FRANK WILLS …and do things like that to the clients and… and they're kind of as a backup and support as well. 

01:06:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right. In the client's corner. 

01:06:35
FRANK WILLS Of course. Exactly, yeah. 

01:06:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, okay. 

01:06:40
FRANK WILLS Actually in… in this instance the… the behavioral experiment stands from the fact that umm… Jan had this view that she tends to get more negative feedback from employers than other people standing from her review of her appraisal situation. And so, what I got to do is to go out and conduct like a mini survey and ask people you know umm… how… how much criticism or you know how much praise or no criticism they got for… from her… from their employers and that allowed to Jan compare her experience with others, perhaps not to find out, perhaps to find out rather this it wasn't her experience wasn't particularly different from others. 

01:07:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:07:30
FRANK WILLS People see in this… 

01:07:30
MIKE SIMMONS But her belief would have been different. 

01:07:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So… so in this instant and Jan thought that she got less well done from her employers than other people did. So, what I did suggest to her was to go out and conduct a mini survey and ask other people often their employers said well done to them. Her prediction would have been that other people's employers said it more often because other people were more worthy of well done as it were. 

01:08:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:05
FRANK WILLS And but we… what she might find out is that their experience actually wasn't terribly different from her I suppose. Let's see by watching the clip. 

01:08:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

01:08:10
Intervention (a) from the third session 

01:08:15
JAN GRAY But my homework… again that was… that was really interesting umm… because I asked… I asked some people from where I work and couple of people had to same line manager as me. Umm… and their response was quite surprising because a lot of them said they always come away feeling that they've done something wrong… 

01:08:35
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:08:35
JAN GRAY …rather than they did something right. 

01:08:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:35
JAN GRAY And I thought that I was quite interesting, and… and then I asked him instead of other people that I know umm… and its interesting that a lot of people don't feel that they get enough positives… that surprise also, so that was really helpful. 

01:08:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

01:08:55
JAN GRAY It wasn't just me. 

01:08:55
FRANK WILLS And if I dial so to(ph) kind of say… 

01:09:00
JAN GRAY Oh, do I? 

01:09:00
FRANK WILLS …I often do that whenever someone to do it just I do it myself you know and I only found one person and I'm not who thought they got regular well done and I think they may even have been, being funny or ironic or something, I'm not sure. 

01:09:10
JAN GRAY Alright. 

01:09:10
FRANK WILLS And you know quite a lot of people saying this as the old people do. 

01:09:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:09:15
FRANK WILLS I think as of… as of ten people I… one said they got some positive feedback very regularly, you know ah… the majority said… said they got negative feedback or they felt they got negative and there's few people sort in middle. 

01:09:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean it's… it's a lesson for me if ever I have to be in that position I think that how I would want to be with staff, which actually brings me on to the next. 

01:09:40
FRANK WILLS Right, right. Yeah. 

01:09:40
JAN GRAY A gender item is that umm… 

01:09:40
MIKE SIMMONS So… so that was a behavioral intervention and when they're going to look a cognitive intervention. 

01:09:50
FRANK WILLS Yes. That's right. We're going to do this in two parts. This next extract will be about intervene and to try and change negative automatic thoughts or modify them. The next one will be about modifying co-beliefs or… or assumptions, a higher level of cognition as it were. 

01:10:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

01:10:05
FRANK WILLS But in this first one, umm… we are reviewing the idea that Jan sometimes has the people don't like her in a specific situation umm… where which involves an… umm… a dinner party and I've gone through the [01:110:30]early stages of getting it a trace out what the automatic thought was, how it links with how she feels and how she behaves and we're now going to move into the classic cognitive method and… and way of working which is for me to start actually now what is the evidence… 

01:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:10:45
FRANK WILLS …that supports and also was the evidence that doesn't support this belief. 

01:10:55
MIKE SIMMONS So its testing out the belief in someway. 

01:10:55
FRANK WILLS Yes, that's right. I can and its about as I said early you know stepping back from the belief is that when you have these negative automatic thoughts they always seem completely plausible… 

01:11:05
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:05
FRANK WILLS …and you have to sort of… and actually the term is quite good one it is, slightly de-organistic(ph), but its about disinterring from the negative thoughts… 

01:11:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:11:15
FRANK WILLS …stepping away from the thing actually is that occasion was it really happening here. And one of the main ways we do that is to… to think about what evidence supports this. I mean you… you probably have the experience yourself, you know maybe some one you know in the street walks past you and doesn't say hello, you know you get to say hello and they just walk past you and you see start to think, I don't know if I offended them or something. 

01:11:40
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:40
FRANK WILLS You know, and then but later when you think it well, maybe they just didn't see me or maybe they were preoccupied and you start to way at the evidence that support one idea or another and then maybe you eventually conclude well, it really can't be any reason why they should be upset with me, they probably just didn't see me… 

01:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:12:00
FRANK WILLS …and you then move on from that experience. But if you stay stuck in it, you kind of think oh well, I done… there must have been something I done rather like we were saying early, you know you're most compulsively… 

01:12:10
MIKE SIMMONS Its nagging away. Yeah. 

01:12:15
FRANK WILLS …like the dog with the bone. 

01:12:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. So a… the least slightly explanation for me in that circumstance would be that the other person didn't notice me, the most slightly explanation is always they noticed me and I've done something wrong or I'm not worth talking to him or something like that. 

01:12:30
FRANK WILLS That's great. Yeah. Well, especially when you're in negative mood to begin with … 

01:12:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:12:35
FRANK WILLS …you must more or like to start from that negative position. 

01:12:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

01:12:35
FRANK WILLS Probably if you're in a relaxed, you probably, you know I think well, probably didn't see me you know that would be your starting point. 

01:12:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So, we'll move to next clip. 

01:12:45
Interventions (b) from the third session 

01:12:45
FRANK WILLS Okay. Yes. So… so the next of them would be to see whether you know these thoughts are kind of reasonable or… or fit the situation because you know if they don't, if it turns out that they do actually quite like you then, it sort of implies that maybe that's a feeling that you don't need to have. And as it's a feeling you really don't like, that would be quite a good outcome in that. 

01:13:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

01:13:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so… so what about umm… umm… so the next little bit(ph) you know comes four or five is we use those to kind of review the evidence because they're only… there's sort of like an opinion if you like aren't they… that they didn't like that, their hypothesis if you like… 

01:13:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:13:35
FRANK WILLS …you know rather than the fact umm… so let… let's take that first… first one, they don't like you… 

01:13:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

01:13:40
FRANK WILLS …they don't like me umm… and we also look at the evidence that could support that… the negative ideas to begin with. 

01:13:50
JAN GRAY Hmm… hmm… 

01:13:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… so… so what evidence is the… that… 

01:13:55
JAN GRAY Well, I know that they… they've met uh… when we haven't been invited I know there's six in the met out of four of them have met when we… 

01:14:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:14:05
JAN GRAY …haven't been invited. 

01:14:05
FRANK WILLS Right, yeah. 

01:14:05
JAN GRAY So… 

01:14:05
FRANK WILLS They had met without and may be four. 

01:14:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:14:10
[sil.] 

01:14:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. And I only have a… I… I… I know actually they never ever phoned me… 

01:14:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

01:14:30
JAN GRAY …or you know come and have a cup of coffee or any of them. Should I write that one there? 

01:14:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:14:40
[sil.] 

01:14:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:14:55
FRANK WILLS Anything else? 

01:14:55
JAN GRAY Well, the fact they're going to weight watchers without me. 

01:15:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… As you finish your writing these things Jan. 

01:15:10
JAN GRAY But I'm actually feeling that it… it must be true. 

01:15:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm. That's okay is there anything else that before we move on to the next column. 

01:15:30
JAN GRAY Well, yeah because they never asked me about what I am doing you know. 

01:15:40
FRANK WILLS When this inner party is running 

01:15:40
JAN GRAY Yeah never, never sort of start conversation with me. 

01:15:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:15:50
[sil.] 

01:15:55
 As well as here, as well actually they never that sounds really silly, but, but may go greet each other, they all you know, they do umm… I never get that? 

01:16:05
FRANK WILLS Umm… umm… you don't get kiss? 

01:16:05
JAN GRAY No. 

01:16:10
[sil.] 

01:16:20
FRANK WILLS Okay now actually before we sort of move on further that column one, one there is a little tip here which is good with these thought records is that you know it's always useful having a second look when you write never anywhere. 

01:16:35
JAN GRAY Right 

01:16:35
FRANK WILLS And it is also very worthwhile having a look at always because one of mine have got phrases about this is "never is an awfully longtime for nothing" something not to happen and always there is an awful longtime of things to happen. Can you just look over those again, I mean, are they literally true you know are they never done those things. 

01:17:00
JAN GRAY Well okay, I mean Linda use to come and have coffee with me, and she doesn't anymore. 

01:17:05
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:17:05
JAN GRAY So. 

01:17:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:17:10
[sil.] 

01:17:15
FRANK WILLS And is there any particular reason for Linda's change in that respect. 

01:17:20
JAN GRAY What I suppose… 

01:17:25
FRANK WILLS Actually we will also put that in the other column because… 

01:17:25
JAN GRAY What they, they are any reason, well yes… 

01:17:25
FRANK WILLS yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:17:30
JAN GRAY …I suppose what's happened is since I've started working… 

01:17:30
FRANK WILLS Right 

01:17:30
JAN GRAY More… 

01:17:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:17:35
JAN GRAY She probably you know I am probably not at home actually. So I put that one there… 

01:17:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, I think so yeah I mean that is evidence against the idea that is to do with not liking you, that's been, been quite a change actually at work. 

01:17:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:17:50
FRANK WILLS And that's what affected any of the other things to do to the other when we work. 

01:18:00
JAN GRAY Umm… I suppose Silvia doesn't work and Elaine, but Elaine does work, but Elaine doesn't live locally. So… so, Silvia has never had not come and had a tea or coffee really. 

01:18:15
FRANK WILLS Another thing I want to lets try this, slightly skeptical motto, you don't mind. You don't mind me doing this to you. 

01:18:25
JAN GRAY No, no, not at all 

01:18:25
FRANK WILLS Umm… I'm curious have they never called you, how enough do they get invite to you, if they don't call you? 

01:18:35
JAN GRAY Yeah okay 

01:18:40
FRANK WILLS So that's another never which is… 

01:18:40
JAN GRAY Yeah I mean, we, we sometimes rearrange the next when we are at the dinner parties so we come on that diaries, but… but yes I have Linda's phoned, Elaine tends to go through Linda who is her sister so yeah okay. 

01:19:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah so, so they do sometimes. 

01:19:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, they do sometimes… 

01:19:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah and is that, is that been changed that all by you being at work? 

01:19:10
JAN GRAY Well of course yes I mean they may phone and I'm not there. 

01:19:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:19:15
JAN GRAY And there are sometimes messages on the answer phone umm… 

01:19:20
FRANK WILLS Okay and… and what about the, the casing bit? 

01:19:30
JAN GRAY When if someone(ph) is… this probably because I probably don't… 

01:19:35
FRANK WILLS Your markers ever some(ph). 

01:19:35
JAN GRAY No. 

01:19:35
FRANK WILLS No… yeah. 

01:19:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:19:40
FRANK WILLS So, so what I mean did Elaine to realize that? 

01:19:45
JAN GRAY I guess I must give off that downwards so that probably this happens… 

01:19:50
FRANK WILLS Are they on the other hand, are they very kissy people? You don't mind my invention of any of your act. 

01:20:00
JAN GRAY Only I suppose the one who does the most kissing I suppose Elaine. So it just tend to be Elaine that is the kissing. Yeah, so they probably picking up that I'm not you know not that way. 

01:20:15
FRANK WILLS Now you say probably well what do you think? What's the most likely thing? 

01:20:20
JAN GRAY Well they are I suppose, because I do tend to when we, when they come to us I do tend to stand behind my husband. 

01:20:30
FRANK WILLS Right so you make it bit difficult thing to do it as you were. 

01:20:35
JAN GRAY I suppose I do actually. 

01:20:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

01:20:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:20:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah and, and you have the right to do that. You don't have to be kissed you know that's not necessarily well within a party. 

01:20:45
JAN GRAY No… no. 

01:20:45
FRANK WILLS No, so it's alright not to be kissed at all. But I guess also someone ought to be kissed as well I don't know. 

01:20:50
JAN GRAY I suppose, yeah I suppose. I suppose it's not so much whether they kiss or don't kiss me is what they do that I'm not doing. 

01:21:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah but actually in this case though there is a little bit exclusion but it is not something the be terribly looking on anyway. 

01:21:10
JAN GRAY No that's true actually. 

01:21:15
FRANK WILLS And I mean could it be, could it be argued that they were showing some consideration for you by not imposing that on you. 

01:21:25
JAN GRAY No… I have never thought that way. 

01:21:30
FRANK WILLS But that's what we are doing as we were trying to think whether there are other ways of thinking about it. 

01:21:30
JAN GRAY Yeah I never thought that way. 

01:21:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, okay well let's just pull that and there are some as a possibility of evidence again this thing are there may be taking inner consideration and we will see what are the evidence that doesn't support the idea they don't like you. Yeah some will see whether that chimes in with that or not. But let's go straight now, you know let's go for the positive case now. Is there any evidence actually that they do like you? 

01:22:05
[sil.] 

01:22:10
JAN GRAY Well we play cards with Mike and Silvia quite regularly. 

01:22:15
FRANK WILLS Are these the immediate neighbors? 

01:22:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:22:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:22:20
JAN GRAY So… 

01:22:20
FRANK WILLS And… and does that go okay or? 

01:22:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:22:25
FRANK WILLS As kind of easier when there is not the other people around. 

01:22:25
JAN GRAY Yeah 

01:22:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah 

01:22:30
JAN GRAY And, and the send me birthday cards. 

01:22:30
MIKE SIMMONS So that stay well with the negative automatic thought. What about the core belief? 

01:22:40
FRANK WILLS Yes well I mean, you didn't remember me saying that one of the differences between, negative automatic thoughts and core beliefs is that the negative automatic thought is very situation specific. So when you are examining that you are looking at evidence which is specific to that situation. 

01:23:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:23:00
FRANK WILLS You know what were people really thinking? What was really happening that right there and then. On the other hand, core believes have been developed over much longer period of time and held over much longer period of time. And that probably be more deeper down, less conscious even then negative automatic thoughts. And so testing almost going to be a different process. This has been a very good method of doing this device by Christine Padesky and this is called a historical test, either of the schema or a core belief? 

01:23:35
MIKE SIMMONS They are the same thing? 

01:23:35
FRANK WILLS Schema is probably a kind of a deeper more generalized structure and it might be something like I'm unworthy. And whereas the core belief is going to put a little bit more context on that and it would be send it like, you know I am not as good as other people or people will not like me or people will not think that I'm any good and so forth. And… and… and the schemas are often very, very sort of visceral are almost in your body that how do you feel about yourself and your life. Whereas the core belief is probably something a bit more specific it can be stated more specifically. 

01:24:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right okay. 

01:24:20
FRANK WILLS In Jan's case it was you know that people will not help me. And so what we did here in the next extract that we were going to look at, we were going through her life and looking back over different instances where people had either helped her or not helped. And what we were thinking was is it really true that people haven't helped me in my life or is it going to be a bit more varied then there are some people may be helped a bit, some people helped a lot, some people have been very unhelpful etcetera. And often you know the, the memory is, is of a much more varied history than you the core belief what have you believe. 

01:25:05
MIKE SIMMONS So there is something about I will discount the memories that actually challenge the core belief. And the job of the therapist is to help me kind of retrieve that and make sense of what actually is not quite only some cases not quite, no one will help me because there is a lots of examples here when they did but I chose to ignore those. 

01:25:30
FRANK WILLS Well that, that is exactly you remember I was saying before that when you are in negative mind set, your mind tends to be focused towards negative events and negative evidence. And that's not only true in the present, but it is true about memories of the past as well. And actually the word cognition actually includes things like memory and perceptions not just, just only about thinking it's about a whole way of knowing about the world and the universe. 

01:25:55
MIKE SIMMONS So let me just rerun this a little bit. I have a core belief about myself. I will ignore as much as possible anything that challenges that core belief. 

01:26:05
FRANK WILLS Exactly yeah. 

01:26:10
MIKE SIMMONS Meanwhile your job as a therapist is to actually do just that, to challenge, find events of the challenge the core belief. 

01:26:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah I mean, the, the, the analogy that sometimes given actually is that you know the… the… the… the client has an entry system in so the way of thinking which is shaped that way and it excludes all things which are in shape like that. 

01:26:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. 

01:26:35
FRANK WILLS So what you are trying to do, is you trying to open up different… 

01:26:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yes, yeah 

01:26:40
FRANK WILLS …entry ports into the mind as it were to bring in a fuller. 

01:26:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah the whole story. 

01:26:45
FRANK WILLS The whole story. 

01:26:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right okay. 

01:26:45
interventions (c) from the fourth session 

01:26:50
FRANK WILLS I mean it's interesting here, you hope can I just comment you that. 

01:26:55
JAN GRAY Yes. 

01:26:55
FRANK WILLS Because this is an example isn't it of some one helping really thinking they are doing the best thing for you. 

01:27:00
JAN GRAY Yes. 

01:27:05
FRANK WILLS But actually it not being quite the right thing. 

01:27:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:27:05
FRANK WILLS You think that in retrospect there is other things that perhaps could have been done. So, so I mean that's interesting isn't it that how it's looking at the moment. Actually there are people who help and sometimes they help spot on like the French teacher sometimes though what they do isn't, isn't quite right. So helping is a… is a more varied matter… 

01:27:30
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:27:35
FRANK WILLS …then perhaps it looks at the first sight. 

01:27:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean that's an interesting thought isn't it. 

01:27:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:27:40
JAN GRAY Yeah I hadn't thought of what my mum doing is helping, but actually she was trying to help me… 

01:27:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:27:45
JAN GRAY …just it didn't. 

01:27:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I mean again I'm just speculating a bit, you know but I suppose that it could lead one to conclude and let, you know actually I don't want to have the society(ph) in the bay as it where… 

01:28:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose it would really, I have not really thought it that way. 

01:28:00
FRANK WILLS And can you remember how you did or where did you go to next? Did you, did you manage to break free at these girls only, only eventually. 

01:28:10
JAN GRAY Not really, what… what happened is that I had… I went to another school trip where and I met a girl from another class. And so I had a friend in another class. 

01:28:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:28:25
JAN GRAY And so lesson times I suppose it was good for my schooling lesson times I didn't you know have a friend that I sat and talk to you know unless you are like… lessons times are about lessons and friends were outside school. 

01:28:45
FRANK WILLS Was this is new friend, a kind of good friend? 

01:28:45
JAN GRAY Oh yes yeah. 

01:28:50
FRANK WILLS Did she help you? 

01:28:50
JAN GRAY Well she was very much stronger than me, I mean she was… she was you know the mouth piece I wasn't actually. I mean she was quite… 

01:28:55
FRANK WILLS What does she think of these three girl… a kind of thing? 

01:29:00
JAN GRAY Actually I don't know they came and told her about them. 

01:29:05
FRANK WILLS Are you bit ashamed or… 

01:29:10
JAN GRAY I think I would have felt embarrassed that they had such an impact on me because my friends would have given them what for, you know if it to be in her. 

01:29:15
FRANK WILLS So you did get less dependent on these? 

01:29:20
JAN GRAY Yeah by about the time I was perhaps 16. 

01:29:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, well it just take time sometimes I mean it sounded like in retrospect what happened you know you, you came down as a bit of northern outsider as it were and you were a little bit. I mean it… it… it's… it's hard to look sometimes that labeling is also part of an acceptance process as a fact. 

01:29:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

01:29:45
FRANK WILLS You know, you, you've given her an identity, which is the first step to reintegration or something like that you know. But anyway you have to you always have to work your way in a bit when you are starting when you were new as you will have to do it. 

01:30:00
JAN GRAY Yeah it happened. 

01:30:00
FRANK WILLS Certainly no doubt, but you did you know and you know… you made a bit mistake on the way and paid a bit for prosper you know but, that's what, that's what we human beings often do. 

01:30:15
JAN GRAY Yeah I have not thought of it that way. 

01:30:15
FRANK WILLS It's one of the ways we learn actually. It's one of the most effective ways of learning to make a mistake and actually hurt… I think. 

01:30:25
JAN GRAY Yeah and that's a completely different way of looking at it isn't it? Because if I look at the mistakes I've made in my life, is… is useful pieces of learning I suppose the things I've done wrong. It actually makes me feel very different, it is not interesting just a few in it from a different angle. Yeah. 

01:30:50
later in the same session 

01:30:55
FRANK WILLS Okay, so, so before we leave this one I mean what if we have to modify this belief that no one will help me what might seem and were reasonable alternative the one the fact fits the facts that we've just described including some people being bloody horrible to you, if you excuse(ph) my French… 

01:31:20
JAN GRAY Well I suppose there are some people have helped me. 

01:31:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:31:30
JAN GRAY And I can't expect everybody to help me, but I but some, but I can expect some people to help me. 

01:31:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah it's likelihood. 

01:31:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

01:31:45
FRANK WILLS People will popup and… 

01:31:45
JAN GRAY And I'm just as like as anyone else to be helped 

01:31:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:31:50
JAN GRAY And I think that's possibly the helpful thought for me is that there is nothing, actually there is nothing different about me. 

01:32:00
FRANK WILLS There is no disqualifying feature, yeah. 

01:32:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, there is nothing that was making me less worthy of helping than anyone else I'm just like everyone else. 

01:32:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay we also saw you, working there to modify our core belief. 

01:32:10
FRANK WILLS That's right and you know that's probably longer term work people have held these believes, the years often they are not going to just change them overnight. But what you're trying to is just start a process where the client can rethink them and… and often that's enough really. 

01:32:30
MIKE SIMMONS It's a process that's going to carry… 

01:32:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah and it may well go on after the therapy, may not be totally completed within the therapy. 

01:32:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay you've given us a kind of flavor of quite a range of techniques here Frank. 

01:32:45
FRANK WILLS Yes and I would like to say obviously there are lot of more techniques and we can't include all of them within this tape although I think some of them are illustrations, some of our other tapes and DVDs. And, but I guess out of the note I would like to really end on an leading into a final extract is to comeback to this point that we've been discussing right from the very start that all this activity has to be carried out within a… a sound therapeutic relationship. There was, there was interesting point within this… these therapy sessions where it became apparent that the client was going to have to move away from the area and the therapy would have to end probably somewhat before we ideally would have wanted it to. So this extract that we are going to see now is an showing the client and myself discussing this situation about the relationship that we have had more we got from it… and in a sense how we can finish it off. 

01:33:55
Ending therapy - from the fourth session 

01:33:55
JAN GRAY I think I've said probably at first or second time we met that I might have difficulty you know trusting you. 

01:34:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:34:00
JAN GRAY And feeling safe enough to… to talk. I was surprised how much I do trust you. 

01:34:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:34:10
JAN GRAY And… and I suppose there is a part of my thinking well okay I've done that once but perhaps not really for that again. 

01:34:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah and I'm wondering you know given that this does feel like you know quite a good relationship as most of the life you know finishing this a kind of thing you're doing. 

01:34:35
JAN GRAY It is strange because I know we've only met four times, but I felt really sad because having somebody well I listen and there was something's that you said that had really shocked me as to how much I understood, you know you understood me and that… that was a real shock and this paused me really like that I thought somebody knew me. 

01:35:05
FRANK WILLS Right, right, yeah, yeah. 

01:35:05
JAN GRAY So I feel quite sad that you know it is going to end. 

01:35:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah and you know let's recognize on both sides there is, there is a little bit sadness… 

01:35:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:35:15
FRANK WILLS …for me as well you know because I have enjoyed working with you. 

01:35:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:35:15
FRANK WILLS You know that's… that should be acknowledged. And but I guess I think that you know maybe the opportunity that arises out of this is to… is to try and have a good ending as a way you know that would be… 

01:35:35
JAN GRAY Right yeah. 

01:35:35
FRANK WILLS …you know which kind of is like, you know we got on really well, we did some good work together and you know that will always be there you know that can't be taken away and away and… 

01:35:50
JAN GRAY …endings are funny things aren't they? 

01:35:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:35:50
JAN GRAY I don't think I… I don't think I do endings particularly well as it was were, you know thinking back in my life this was the endings I've had. So the idea of that being you know a nice… 

01:36:05
FRANK WILLS Sounds a bit radical decision. 

01:36:05
JAN GRAY Well it sounds… it sounds you know, you would… you would feel different, yeah instead of end without somebody feeling hurt. 

01:36:15
FRANK WILLS So what you think the problem is with… with endings? 

01:36:15
JAN GRAY With endings then I suppose an ending for me has very much feel like I've been deserted, being left. 

01:36:25
FRANK WILLS Alright. 

01:36:30
JAN GRAY …left behind. And so I would tend to do the leaving so I didn't have to have that feeling of being left. Yeah. 

01:36:40
[sil.] 

01:36:45
FRANK WILLS So, so let's try and now think about our situation because the fact of the matter is we are gonna to be, you know let me in different, different area so, umm… what you know what can we do which is helpful to make this a good ending as it were. And we've acknowledged that there is a little bit of the work undoubtedly, you know sure may be I can just say now that… that I've actually done this once or twice before with other people. The last time my client went to Afghanistan in a short while, so you know Scotland should be no problem. And… and there… there the e-mail was… was the only you know contact that we made so. You know we did how e-mail exchanges and… and because I had to… I had to face the issue that… that is my professional time, you know so I would have that kind of charge of feeling some sort over this. And… and what else running whether we could have, you know may be on a couple of more occasions at least and then we could review it you know an e-mail exchange and then a telephone conversation to follow up. So you might for example send me the thought record and I could have a look at them we could discuss it on the telephone. And my experience with the other situations I've been in it roughly translates to, you know those two things an e-mail and telephone call roughly translates too like a weekly therapy sessions so if they would be similar nature to that. 

01:38:25
JAN GRAY Yeah I think that's a really good idea and I like the idea of instead of being a formal, you know that we would arranged a phone because that would help keep me on track rather so you know that sounds a good idea. 

01:38:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah and then you know we could do that on… 

01:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay and that's the final extract and through a sequence of extracts we've seen the process of CBT through from beginning to end. 

01:38:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah that's right, we… we tried to give as much of the flavor as is possible within this context of the sequence that goes from assessment to formulation to intervention. Obviously, we can't include everything thing in that but we hope to have conveyed the main thrust of each of those movements through the therapy process. 

01:39:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah sure, anything you want to leave us with? 

01:39:20
FRANK WILLS Well yes obviously I really hope that the people watching the… the DVD will have enjoyed what they have seen. And have gained more insight into CBT as a… as a therapy. But I had also kind of being a CBT therapist myself. I would like to feel I might influence the behavior and which would I hope enquires them to consider whether this was something they might have a go at learning themselves. And of course if they're going to learn it, it would have to be in the context of some form of proper training supervision, support, learning and so on. But these context all now much more widely available than when I first began my training. So my message is, get out there and find them and… and get involved with this. Let's, let's give the clients a good quality service. 

01:40:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay thanks very much.

Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas.
