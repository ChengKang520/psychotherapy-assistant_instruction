ALEXANDER STREET PRESS HAWAII ACA 2014 Conference & Expo ACA Counseling in Action Demonstration Series A Threat Assessment with a Non-Traditional Student Brian Van Brunt 

00:00:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So they asked me to come and do, ah, a video demonstration with you today and Peter was, ah, gracious enough to be, uhm, roped and headlock into this experience, uhm, with us so he's gonna be my, uhm, patient today. And, ah, we're gonna demonstrate some threat assessment concepts for you during the next 90 minutes or so. Ah, my goals to do, just a real brief introduction probably five to 10 minutes to give you some basic concepts. There are some, ah, PowerPoints that have been uploaded onto the web as well as I have my cards floating around somewhere in the table. If you need resources related to threat assessment you either looking at doing this more or you're interested in this topic, I'd be happy to share some things with you. Uhm, I missed the other housekeeping things. Uhm, I guess I can plug my book coming out, uhm, in August. Uhm, it will be called Harm to Others: Assessing Dangerousness-- ah, Managing and Assessing Dangerousness. One of my passions is to teach counselors specifically, not, not psychologist, I like psychologist, but I'm an LPC at heart. Uhm, so the idea of teaching counselors how to do threat assessments is something that I'd be interested in helping us kind of improve our skills that are around. I think one of the challenges we have, in grad school, right? We've all gone through grad school, we've had the experience. When you hear harm to self, you get that, right? You're like, okay, suicide assessment, mental status exam, we're gonna bring out the, I don't know, Hamilton or the Beck and we're gonna, and we're gonna get a picture of someone's risk, right? And most of us would do that fairly comfortably. Uhm, when it comes to harm to others, that's where we get a little tricky, right? If we're thinking about bipolar disorder or mania or schizophrenia, most of us can do a basic assessment to say, "Okay, well this person thinks he is, you know, Jesus and, uhm, he's looking at you, and you know, carrying a knife around and you know, sacrificing people." That's not good and we can all make a pretty common, uhm, assessment that there's some dangerousness there and it maybe needs an in-patient hospitalization. Here's the thing though, right, and this is where our concern comes up. What are we being asked to do nowadays? Uhm, so and so at college posts on Facebook, I'm gonna shoot my professor in the face because they gave me a B. Uhm, in the elementary school, right, I'm gonna, uhm, come back to school with a knife from home and I'm gonna cut up some people in class. One of your community client says, uhm, "I don't know what I'm gonna do at work, uhm, but I'm telling you if my supervisor says that to me one more time, uhm, he won't be talking for long." You know, and that's, that's where were really moving even a little bit away from mental health, right, in getting into the area of workplace violence, which is an entire if you're aware of this you know, decades of research related to this topic, Meloy and Hart, uhm, some really great fears have been writing on the issues of violence assessment as it applies to workplace founds, the post office shootings, school shootings, rampage shooting. So, I think one of the next things we're gonna see, one of the innovations I believe in college counseling and, and, uhm, K312 as well as community counseling really is, uhm, this growth for counselors picking up a bit more in their skill set as it relates to someone who might express a harm to others, uhm, specifically, uhm, in either workplace or a school setting, uhm, beyond mental health concerns. And so we're gonna talk about a little bit today. The case that we're gonna demonstrate, uhm, Peter is playing the case of a non-traditional graduate student, an older graduate student, uhm, studying psychology. And, uhm, there's a threat that he's made against his professor. And I work at the college, ah, where he goes. And, uhm, I'm going to be doing an assessment to determine his risk to, I guess, number one, remain at the college. With this, I'm gonna consult with the dean of students and consult with the administration and let them know after this session, uhm, whether or not I feel like he's safe to remain. Uhm, and I'm also making a determination, is there a law enforcement response that we need if he ends up saying, "Yeah, I have a gun right here. And by the way, when I leave the session today, I'm gonna go find that professor." Well, then it's not really an administrative concern, is it? Then it becomes a law enforcement concern fairly quickly. Uhm, so we'll demonstrate that for you. Uhm, probably my experience is it usually goes about 30 to 40 minutes, ah, maybe a little longer if we really get going. And, ah, after that, it will leave time for questions and we'll do it in that kind of impromptu question way where you can ask questions both of me and what I was feeling and why I ask what I asked, and also of Peter and how he felt about that situation. And I'm also asking kind of what we missed. Uhm, if you were in the driver's seat, what would you ask that I missed in this session? In terms of informed consent, let's assume that Peter is assigned one at this point, that he's given me permission to do this assessment. Uhm, this is the first time I'm meeting him. And, uhm, there is an expectation I'm gonna be sharing the results of what I find with the dean of students and the conduct officer following our conversation. So this is not counseling per se, uhm, and that he's my only client. I really do have kind of a duel relationship here. I'm concerned both with Peter, if he suddenly becomes suicidal or threatening to someone else, I have some obligations ethically to work with him, but I also have this other piece of it where I'm an agent of the school making a determination and an assessment. Uhm, so I assume that I've gone over with that with him as we begin. 

00:05:15
Core Concepts • Direct communicated threat • Hardened or inflexible beliefs resulting in arguments and threats to others • Fixation and Focus on target (person, place system) • Organized versus disorganized threat • Escalation or impulsive action • Action and time imperative for attack • Fantasy of revenge, leakage of plan • Weapon access, lethality of plan 

00:05:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, a couple of slides for you, I know it's a little hard to see here. Just some core concepts, uhm, that I'm gonna be looking for as you're following along at home, listening to what we're talking about. I'm gonna look at direct communicated threat. Uhm, one of things I'll focus on is hardened or inflexible beliefs. That's another area of concern that I'll, I'll narrow in on. We'll make the slide and-- these slides available to you so you have them. I'm also gonna be concerned with the fixation and focus on target. This is, ah, a concept. If you imagine if I have a camera in my hand, like this gentleman over here, right? And if he starts to kind of move over here to this side, right, we're starting to see a, uhm, a fixation on this part of the room, right? We're ignoring y'all. It's my Kentucky coming out, my y'all over there. Uhm, so then we focus in, sorry, on person, right? So in a college setting, for example, if I'm going to be concerned about a student who says all this liberal professors on camp, it's always Obama loving liberal professors, right? They are the problem on campus right now. But you know who the one professor I really hate is the vamp drunk guy. All right, his hair has got that like hippy thing going and he's the worst to the bunch and if you are listening to son of a bitch, right, and then it narrows on to that one person. It's that concept of narrowing of target. It's something that we pay attention to as well. Organized versus disorganized threat. Am I someone who's threatening everyone that I meet? From the parking guy to the Starbucks lady to the check in person at the Hilton to-- right? Is that just who I am? I kind of gruff and difficult with everyone I run into or is it more organized towards one person? Is there an action and time imperative towards the attack? And this is one of the most central concepts. Think about suicide assessments for a moment, right? Uhm, we understand someone can be chronically suicidal but not eminently suicidal. The same goes with threat assessment. We can understand that this is not a person we wanna watch our kids or invite over for Sunday dinner, right? We're like, "I don't wanna really know this person." But also that to not eminently going to have an attack. Uhm, so we wanna pay attention to some of those differences too. We might be concerned about Peter, but we're not concerned to the point where Peter needs to be incarcerated right now. He needs to be watched. He needs to engage in a therapy. Uhm, fantasies of revenge, weapons access, lethality of plan. 

00:07:30

00:07:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, I've divided-- designed, designed a tool called the SIVRA, it's the Structured Interview for Violence Risk Assessment. Uhm, it has 35 items here that I'm gonna be going through. Not really in a structured one after the other way, but more of a Socratic method. If anyone has done mental status exams before, right, there's two ways to do that. One is you have the sheet and you're like, "Let me ask you three items until you really go through it and then you score it." The other way to do it is kind of for memory. You're just kind of working in circular questioning, and this is kind of how I'll do the SIVRA. I'm gonna be all over the map. But what my goal is for our 30 or 40 minutes today is to really get to the heart of all 35 of these items. And as I said, they're loaded up on the, ah, ACA website for you and I'll make them available to you after this program. Have some cards you're welcome to take them. 

00:08:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Peter, my name is Brian Van Brunt. Nice to meet you. 

00:08:25
PETER Nice to meet you. 

00:08:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I'm happy for you to be here. You can, ah, grab a seat if you're comfortable. Uhm, what I'd wanna talk to you today a little bit about the situation going on with your professor. Uhm, there was a concern reported to me and my role with the school is to really have a conversation with you. Uhm, about the, the concern, the threat that was made against your professor. So I wanna heard the school's side of the story and I wanna really hear your side of the story and get a, a better understanding of what happened from you. Can you walk me through what you're-- what was going on with this professor? 

00:08:55
PETER Well, yeah, I had, uhm, just to start with, I had approached her the first day of class and told her that I had special learning needs that the school had for accommodations. And it's not, ah, the typical for her class to, ah, have my books on audiotape. 

00:09:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:09:15
PETER And, uhm, she preferred if I didn't use them in class. And, uhm, that would-- but she had signed the agreement that she would accommodate me with all the needs that the university said that I could utilize to be able to be success-- successful in her class. 

00:09:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:09:30
PETER And, uhm, she only had two exams. One was the midterm and one was the final. And up to the point of the midterm she refused to let me use-- uhm, for me to use a dictation to take my midterm instead of writing it out like in localize and had it typed out for me. 

00:09:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:09:50
PETER And, uhm, which I ended up failing her class, or I failed my midterm, I should say. And, uhm, when I met with her and ask her about and explain my side of the story, she said that it wasn't her problem, that it was my fault for not being able to answer her questions and to do her exam. You know, that everybody else was-- she's not gonna make the exception for me from the rest of the students I went in the class. 

00:10:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well, I think there's a lot going on there already cuz one of the things I know is when I was in graduate school we have this-- like, the ones where you just the two tests. I mean, you're in this heightened stress environment already, right? 

00:10:30
PETER Right. 

00:10:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Cuz she's only giving you this two opportunities to get, get grades in her class - 

00:10:35
PETER Correct. 

00:10:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - and determine the final. 

00:10:35
PETER Correct. 

00:10:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And there was book on tape that you needed or that... 

00:10:40
PETER Well, all my books are on audiotape. 

00:10:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Audiotape. Okay. 

00:10:40
PETER Okay. And then which helps me follow along, it's, it's the kind like I have to overstimulate to learn. 

00:10:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:10:50
PETER And so when it comes to exams, I take use, ah, software called Dragon which is I talk into a microphone and dictates it. And, ah, instead of me trying to write it out, I can talk it because I can organize my thoughts better when I'm talking out loud. 

00:11:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:11:05
PETER And instead of disrupting the whole class, I go into a separate facility and take it and she didn't like that. And she'll like, I couldn't take the exam where I'm disrupting the whole class and talking about it verbally to myself to put my thoughts on paper. 

00:11:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. 

00:11:20
PETER And, uhm, and so, so-- and not allowing me to do that I ended up not being able to write as well, you know. The... 

00:11:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It seems like you'll make the whole class harder. 

00:11:35
PETER Well, it does. I mean, her expectation says, if it's less than 15 pages she wouldn't accept it, it was an automatic fail. So I'm like, well, I can't write 15 pages in two hours even if I tried. And I can talk that fast, but I can't write my thoughts out, organize it as she wanted them on paper. 

00:11:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:11:55
PETER And so I ended up failing. And when I got my exam back, I unfortunately, uhm, kind of told it out loud that I wish she was dead and that was-- you know, she better watch behind her back because she'll be taken care of. 

00:12:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:12:10
PETER And, you know, whole class snorted so I was kinda-- yes, that's why I'm sitting here. 

00:12:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Well, that is why you're sitting here with me. You know, in this day and age, one of the things colleges are doing is paying a little more attention to, uhm, threats that are made and you know, I appreciate you coming in and talking with me today. Not everyone I know has made-- it takes, ah, of that opportunity to come in. Ah, I've had folks also come in before and they've been invited and they don't always show up. So I appreciate you coming in and talking with me. I can't imagine this was an easy thing for you. You know, to come in to some. Especially since you're studying counseling, to come in to some counselor's office, and talk to me about, you know, a threat that you made against the professor. 

00:12:45
PETER Well, it's embarrassing because, you know, everybody says, well, I'm supposed to be a counselor but at the same time I'm like, I'm human and that it felt like my invites for taking away - 

00:12:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:12:55
PETER - to succeed in this so, you know, my self-defenses to get violent, you know, is a threat. 

00:13:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Is this the only, uhm, professor that you've had this accommodation request with? There's been... 

00:13:05
PETER No. 

00:13:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT No. Ah, so you've had other requests to the professors. How about the response? I mean, has she been really the first who is like, know enough for my class? 

00:13:15
PETER Uhm, out of the three professors, out of the three classes I was taking, they signed the agreements. 

00:13:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:13:25
PETER One accommodate, the other two were like, "No, these are my-- this is my classroom and I don't change the policy for anybody. I will sign this," but she crossed out everything that I was-- that was written down that I could have used this accommodation. 

00:13:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. And, ah, it's already hard enough and that you're kinda have in this other upheld battle of trying to argue with the professors to get the, the, the extra help that you need to do well. 

00:13:50
PETER Well, just to get a fair shot at being able to succeed in the class. 

00:13:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. It's not even extra help, it's just kinda getting to that level playing field - 

00:13:55
PETER Right. 

00:13:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - with everyone else. 

00:13:55
PETER Correct. 

00:14:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It maybe even my verbalization of like extra shot-- like, maybe that's kinda how they see it. 

00:14:00
PETER Well... 

00:14:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Like, why do you get the special treatment when you're just trying to get even. 

00:14:05
PETER I don't look at the learning disability as a special treatment/ 

00:14:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:14:10
PETER I think everybody learns in a different way. And, you know, you're in a university where they-- ah, they are the teachers so this is the way that, you know, this is how I learned. I mean, I had to go through testing through the university and they, they determine that this is how he is gonna learn and succe-- succeed in this program. And so to me I thought she's going against the university because she denied what they said I have to use to be able to make it through this course. 

00:14:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, that make sense to me. So you know, you kind went through all the hoops that they set up for you. 

00:14:40
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:14:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT The testing, and the meetings, and the-- all this extra stuff. 

00:14:45
PETER Right. 

00:14:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And now that you bring the paper to the professors, they're... 

00:14:45
PETER They're saying no. 

00:14:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. We're making you hop-- jump through other hoops. They give you like a provision, oh, yes-- like, yes, but not this, and the scratching stuff off. 

00:14:55
PETER Correct. 

00:14:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well, I'm sorry about that. Yeah. 

00:14:55
PETER Well, I just figured, you know, it will come around, you know, one way. 

00:15:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. How-- with the learning disability, with the challenges that you had, you know, getting through college and getting up into graduate school, has this been a frustration that you've had before with, with folks in the teaching environment or have they been more accommodating like undergrad for you? 

00:15:15
PETER Undergraduate is more accommodating. I mean, I've always had a learning disability. Uhm, I dropped out of highschool because it got too frustrating for me. Uhm, I decided to go back when I was 38, you know, get, get my highschool diploma and GD and then go-- get in to grad-- undergrad - 

00:15:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:15:35
PETER - and grad school. 

00:15:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:15:40
PETER You know, late bloomer. Eventually, I got it. But I've always had the frustration in highschool. And it wasn't determined that I was-- had learning disability until I was in 11th grade. And at that point, I was so far behind that I said I screw it, you know. I kinda have a feeling with school and I thought well, as I've got older I'm more determined to do something. And with that still in my mind from highschool, I don't think I was gonna make it. But I made it. You know, and they said, well, this is what you have. And they helped me-- with my undergrad, that transition made to the graduate level easily-- easier than trying to do it on my own. 

00:16:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. So not always an easy journey for you but one that you worked hard to kinda stick with and... 

00:16:25
PETER Yeah. 

00:16:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Imagine that old college isn't the sprint, it's a marathon. You know, kinda sticking with the overtime and fighting then. 

00:16:35
PETER Well, there's a lot of fighting there. I mean, it's slow and steady but you know, somehow I'll figure out a way to get there. Uhm, but I, I relied on the school to be helping me get there. 

00:16:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:16:45
PETER And some professors kind of pulled that out from underneath me and I kind of take offense to it. 

00:16:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. It's understandable. Have you ever had a, a conduct action like this where you have to meet with someone or got in trouble at school where you had, uhm, you know, something that you did like this that the school didn't like or they required you to meet with student conduct or something? 

00:17:05
PETER Well, my conduct is always-- let's just say this is the first time I've been caught. 

00:17:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. So you've had some problems before but you, uhm... 

00:17:10
PETER I've-- I mean, I've, I've made-- I've sent some, uhm, I guess you would say threatening ma-- emails, you know, to professors. Uhm, or you know, talked about with my classmates that you know, I made sure the professor would kinda overhear me, but couldn't really hear what I'm saying, but you would hear something. But, uhm, this was the actual one way my anger got the best of me and I've verbalized it vocally where-- and slam the door where everybody heard. 

00:17:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So this is kind of following, right, you've done things like this before, but never to this kind of level - 

00:17:50
PETER Right. 

00:17:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - which is louder and, and maybe a little more out of control for you. 

00:17:50
PETER Well, this was more out of control than normal, for me. 

00:17:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT In the, in the world I work, ah, in threat assessment, they, they talk about this difference between sort of saying things and doing things. And I, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about that concept just to be straight with you and kinda get it out on the table. But you know, if you were in my shoes, you know, part of what you'd be trying to figure out is that someone who said something that they regret and never would really hurt the other person versus someone where they said something and they've been thinking about hurting them for quite sometime. And I'm trying to get an understanding of which, which category you'd fall into there. You know, is this something you would actually do? Have you thought about what you would do in terms of hurting her? Or was this more of an impulsive thing that you just shouted out? Tough question. 

00:18:35
PETER Well, well, it's kind a two-part question for me - 

00:18:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:18:40
PETER - cuz I have two-- for me, it's two different lives. I have a life toward where I would plotted it out and thought about it and I wouldn't have carried it out but I would have hired somebody to carry it out for me to where I'm at today where I will just you know, verbalize it and then regret it cuz I'll say, "Ah, that was not the right thing to say." And I have-- I could-- I wanna say rationalize it because I still think about it sometimes and this is like, "What can I do to make their life a living hell?" And if I could, you know. Whether it's being up in their face or just being more of a problem student, then I need to be. 

00:19:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. And what I thought of it towards that is that when I hear that I immediately think, well, if they've hurt me then I'm gonna hurt them back. I mean, is that where you're coming from with it or is it... 

00:19:35
PETER Yeah. That's where I come from. I've, I've, I've always had to fight for everything and those who I feel are a threat to my-- what I take seriously. 

00:19:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:19:45
PETER Like my education. Before, I never really took serious, so it was more like, yeah, it was more of just the saying-- just to be saying something stupid. But now it's more of a personal threat. So I take it in-- when I feel like it's-- I'm losing it. That's when I'll offend for it and I'll defend it. And then, uhm, it's sometimes too late after I've said the words or the actions that I kinda regret it cuz it wasn't the right way or whatever. 

00:20:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Are there things in your life that help you feel more-- I guess, I'm gonna use some words. It may not fit, but it kind of calm and, and, and safe and, and stable in terms of, you know, not saying this kind of things. You know, for me, if I-- when I get angry, when I get upset, some of the things that keep me from being more explosive or sharing that with someone, might be my friends, my family, intimate relationships, person I'm dating, ah, my kids, you know, what, what helps you when you get to that point? Or do you have that, that kind of group around you that helps keep you, ah... 

00:20:45
PETER I don't have that group. 

00:20:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
PETER I have, I have my Great Dane. I have my two Great Danes that are my kind of release. 

00:20:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

00:20:55
PETER You know, or my gardening. I mean, that's-- I, I, I lost everybody I knew and Katrina so I don't have anybody left, you know. So I carry a lot of that guilt with me sometimes. 

00:21:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Were you in New Orleans when Katrina hit? 

00:21:10
PETER Yes. 

00:21:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well... 

00:21:15
PETER And so my, my anger, because I don't have anybody to talk to, and like, the friends that I have in that school, they're so much younger than me that they can't relate to what I've been through. So I usually just keep it to myself. And so I-- my safe haven-- or when I get that angry is to resort to my dog who is the only one that survived with me, she got out with me, she's been with me ever since. So she's like the only that knows when I'm at that point that can calm me down. 

00:21:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. What's your dog's name? 

00:21:45
PETER Serena. 

00:21:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Serena? 

00:21:45
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:21:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Cool. And you said you had two. You got one too? 

00:21:45
PETER I have two, and I have Lucy her daughter. She had-- I brought her. She had a puppy and so her name is Lucy. 

00:21:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. I have a big old mix so not, not the big Great Danes that are-- ah, are they big dogs? 

00:22:00
PETER Yeah, 150 pounds. 

00:22:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Wow, all right. 

00:22:00
PETER Fluffy though. 

00:22:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So they're your touch point. They are your... 

00:22:05
PETER They're my grounding point. 

00:22:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:22:05
PETER You know, and, and I-- and, and I do-- they don't have to be with me, but if I think of them, like, okay, who's gonna take care them? And that will calm me down because Serena has kind of special needs that nobody can take care of her like I can. So it kinda keeps me in check with-- that there's nobody there for her except for me. And so that's my calming-- that's where my brain goes when I get so mad that I can't see straight that I have to think of-- she's the first thing that pops into my head and what's gonna happen to her. 

00:22:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. She's kind of, ah, uhm, safety place for you. 

00:22:45
PETER Right. 

00:22:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And as you said, the touch-- ah, the touching point. 

00:22:45
PETER She's my touching point. 

00:22:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Touching point, I like that phrase. Yeah. Uhm, thanks, thanks for sharing that with me. You said gardening, too. You're so passionate. 

00:22:55
PETER Yeah. I have... 

00:22:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Do you go with flowers or food or a little bit of both? 

00:23:00
PETER No, I have-- it's what I call my victory garden for-- it's a rose garden that I've created that for everybody that I've lost. And I've planted a rose for everybody I've lost and I nurture it like if they were alive. You know, you know, just keeping the doubt and that cutting the blooms and feeding and you know, I can spend days there, you know. Sort of... 

00:23:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Just beautiful image, yeah. I haven't heard of someone who had the way of cutting... 

00:23:25
PETER I talk to them everyday cuz I, I don't have anybody. So that's who I talk to, it's my roses. 

00:23:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. You say you have these two thoughts at once simultaneously. One is that like I've said it's such a beautiful image of how the expressed grief and expressed things and have our way to kind of connect. On the other hand, I have this image of like, if it's a garden. Uhm, how roses do you have? 

00:23:50
PETER 240. 

00:23:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Wow! Wow! 

00:23:50
PETER It's a 150-feet long garden. 

00:23:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Wow! The enormity of that just blows me away. Is that from Kat-- Katrina? 

00:24:00
PETER Katrina. Well, Katrina, like-- my, my sister died 15 years ago and my father died eight years ago. You know, just my grandparents. You know, people who have just died, but mostly it was my friends and my partner that I had in New Orleans. My people that worked for me, they're-- you know, everybody that was any part of my life there, I've lost. And so I've-- you know, when I started it, it, it didn't seem to be that big of a deal until I finished and I wrap around the corner and my house sits on a corner and from my driveway all the way around to the alley is my rose garden. You know, and now people saw them and just ask if they can cut them and I'm like, no, because you're cutting them, you know, for me. 

00:24:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Wow! Well, thank you for sharing that. It's a, it's a beautiful image and one that, uhm, that speaks to your loss and your journey. That's powerful. 

00:25:00
PETER Well, that's a journey that got me into counseling. You know, that's what made me decided to become a counselor. Going through Katrina, the only part of a reality of my world was helping people. And to get some kind of normal see, and I found it comforting to take care of other people that were stuck in the streets. So when I got out of there, and I've went through a series of problems, but when I finally came to and realize that that's what I'm supposed to be doing. 

00:25:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:25:35
PETER And I got into a program so having this professor telling me that I wasn't good enough for the counseling program, she invaded me and told me that I couldn't do that and that's not what I wanted to hear or say so... 

00:25:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:25:50
PETER You know. 

00:25:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT What did you, uhm, do before when you, ah, and Katrina in New Orleans? 

00:25:55
PETER I-- well, I have an old art. Uhm, the last that it functioned, I can-- I use hot plaster molding and then the French quarter, the-- all the molding and the medallions are made out of hot plaster and that was my job. That-- I had owned a business that I would go in and restore or restorate old medallions in, uhm, hot mud plastering. 

00:26:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. I feel like there's some connection between that and counseling too. 

00:26:20
PETER Yeah. 

00:26:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You know, like, going in and helping and - 

00:26:25
PETER Fixing. 

00:26:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - recasting. 

00:26:25
PETER Recasting, remolding, and reshaping, helping them find better, look better to the original state of-- with that person is supposed to be. 

00:26:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. Yeah. Ah, I, I see I think a little more as much as I can why this incident with the professor was particularly, you know, one that struck you as hard as it did and, and kind of created that reaction in you. 

00:26:50
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:26:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That frustration. Uhm, you know, one of the things you said concerned me this idea of in, in the past that you might have hired someone to deal with this and that seemed so out of step from the conversation we're having. Uhm, was that an actual statement like you in the past you would, you would have found-- I'm, I'm thinking of a hitman. I mean, I don't know if that's... 

00:27:10
PETER Well, you can say a hitman. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that's just something I would have done. I would have it carried out. It was threat too, you know. 

00:27:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:27:20
PETER People would never really push me to that point, but they pushed it-- me far, far enough to where I would say that statement. 

00:27:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:27:30
PETER I have that ability? Yes. 

00:27:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT To find someone who could threaten that person? 

00:27:30
PETER To find-- yeah. 

00:27:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:27:35
PETER You know. Ah, it, it-- the way I've come from and how I was brought up, I've learned that you know there's a-- that you can put a price for everything. 

00:27:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:27:45
PETER You know, and-- but nobody really have actually gotten me to that point. I've made the threat, and that was enough for where they would back off. You know, have I ever carried it out, no. 

00:28:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Do you think it's gotten to that point with this professor that you are thinking more about that or fantasizing about what would it be like? 

00:28:05
PETER There's one professor I can't seem to let it go. I'm, I'm holding on to it. You know, I have-- what I carried out, I'm hoping I won't, but I find myself just thinking about it, you know, how, how to go about doing it. And I find kind of a satisfaction with it, you know, that it kind of helps me find a peace. You know, like, hmm, I can do this and not feel bad about it. 

00:28:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Almost like a... 

00:28:35
PETER Because she deserves it. I think, you know, she has done this to me, she has done it to other students, she deserves to be taken out. 

00:28:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:28:45
PETER You know, she's not a very good professor. 

00:28:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So there's two things I'm hearing, one almost like a solace that would come from that, like a peace, like a... 

00:28:50
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:28:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And, and also the sense of justice that she deserves this, that this is something that, you know, if she, if she didn't act this way, this isn't something that would have happened. You know, she's, she's... 

00:29:00
PETER Correct. She provoked this so she has it come into war. 

00:29:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. She made her own bed. 

00:29:05
PETER And she'll lie there. 

00:29:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Uhm, with all the, the things that you've been through, uhm, you know, I can't connect to that. Ah, ah, New Orleans is a beautiful city and, and one that I visited often. But, uhm, I didn't go in-- go through anything what you went through with losing that much. Uhm, ah, help me understand-- you know, you mentioned the rose garden, you mentioned the dogs, uhm, you know, uhm, Serena and Lucy that, you know, help you through this. Counseling, you know, have said something that you've considered, have you talked to a counselor before or psychologist about some of this, or that just doesn't for you? 

00:29:40
PETER I have, and, uhm, they've actually don't wanna go into that area with me because they don't, they-- well, they've tell me they're not qualified to handle that kind of traumatic experience. So... 

00:29:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I'm sorry. 

00:30:00
PETER It's, it's not for my lack of not trying, it's the lack of there's no of service to help me. 

00:30:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well... 

00:30:05
PETER So which makes me just feel like, well then I'm just gonna be living in this area of my mind without really resolving it kind of why I'm going into counseling. Maybe I can help counsel myself, you know, and finding answers, you know, within my, my own being but it's, it's kinda hard to look at yourself when-- and say, okay, I don't have any push my own buttons but me and it's-- doesn't really work cuz they kinda go around it. 

00:30:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. First, that that was kind of a noble pursuit. I've known a lot of people who've gone through counseling programs and I've actually trained some graduate students myself and people going through that process. It's, ah, to me an ability to try to understand yourself a bit more, you know, through that process, you know, kind of healing yourself, but like you said, I think there's some limitation to it. It's hard to, to be your own doctor sometimes. 

00:30:55
PETER I can be my own doctor or like I can help somebody going through a crisis, you know, I could help you per se if you were to go through a crisis, I could... 

00:31:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

00:31:10
PETER I would understand what you're going through, and that's basically why I wanted to get into this. Where I live there's nobody, you know, to have the threat-- the purpose that I want to and say that they can't ha-- help me because they don't understand what I'm going through. 

00:31:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:31:25
PETER And that thoughts that I have, and what triggers them that I'd be the first in my area to have that ability to help people in a crisis situation. 

00:31:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. I'm really sorry for that. You know, I, I feel like in our conversation even today I had hinted that myself saying that I, I don't have a, a frame of reference for going through the pain that you went through. As a clinician though I don't see that as precluding me from talking to you about it, and that part of me is, uhm, I, I feel sorry that you've gone through that experience with other therapists that feels like you showed up with a, a gallon of water to, to try to share and they have this cup and they're like, oh, you have a gallon of water, you-- I can't-- I only have a cup and that - 

00:32:05
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:32:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT - leave you feeling, uhm, like me, if I were in that situation, feeling pretty horrible. Uhm... 

00:32:10
PETER Well, it makes me feel worse about myself. 

00:32:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:32:15
PETER You know, I'm thinking maybe... 

00:32:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT She's the professional and they can't help me either. 

00:32:15
PETER Right. I've seen, I've been denied that, so I'm therefore left with what? 

00:32:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Well, I know you came in to see me today in the threat assessment capacity and, and to maybe take a moment just to explain a little bit more of what I'm looking at. You know, we're talking, and, uhm, after this conversation I'm gonna talk to the dean of students, make a recommendation about whether you stay in the program or not. Uhm, one of the recommendations I can tell you right off is, ah, ah, I feel like we have a nice connection. Uhm, I would like to continue seeing you. And I do feel comfortable talking about some of the things that you're going through, you know, for you to stay at the school to have an opportunity to talk to someone. You know, and you don't have to make a decision right now about that, but I do feel like part of this process. It's gonna be connecting up with someone and I can talk to you about some of the things that you're having going on in your head. 

00:33:05
PETER Okay. 

00:33:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, so again, I don't need your answer right this minute. But that as I'm talking to you and listening to your story, uhm, I, I feel like having you have some ongoing connection with someone from our counseling center. Uhm, whether that's me or one of the other clinicians here, uhm, would be helpful for you. Uhm, I think. So I know where, uhm, you've relocated to Texas, you know, from, from New Orleans perhaps not your choice. I don't know, ah... 

00:33:30
PETER It's not my choice. 

00:33:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT No. That's-- I know a lot of folks who moved up and, ah, are, are you planning to go back at some point or are you-- sort of big question. 

00:33:35
PETER I've attempted. Uhm, nine attempts to get to New Orleans and I end up driving around the state. I can't get myself to cross the border. So that's, that's, that's something I'm still trying to work through. 

00:33:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:33:55
PETER Uhm, would I ever go back there, I don't think I can. 

00:33:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:34:00
PETER I mean, my, my images of that are too, are too engrained to think beyond, you know, going back there. I have to stay in the present and I can't take the present there cuz it's-- when I hit that border, I go back to August 28, and it's just drilled into my head. I can't change it. That's the date I go back to even though it's, it was just last year I tried to go and that date came back into my head and that was it. I turn around, drove all the way around and went to Florida instead. 

00:34:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT You've tried your best to make it there. 

00:34:40
PETER Tried to make it there, I tried to make it there in three days, I've taken up it a week cuz I had to drive around Louisiana. 

00:34:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT There a strength to that, I, I feel. You know, the trying. 

00:34:50
PETER I think it's crazy. 

00:34:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well, sometimes, ah, there's a strength in craziness too, you know, to try in nine different times too and you try to get back too whatever I assume you'd see is home but feeling like you hit that wall, but you, you try again. 

00:35:00
PETER Right. 

00:35:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Ah, these are all things I'd love to keep talking to you about. Uhm, for the, ah, assessment that I'm doing today. I had a couple of other questions I'm gonna ask you if you feel comfortable answering it. 

00:35:10
PETER Sure. 

00:35:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, they're kinda, ah, sometimes they can feel a bit like non sequiturs. They're just kinda-- they're part of a list to have in my head. 

00:35:15
PETER Okay. 

00:35:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, I know Texas is a, a bit of a gun state. 

00:35:20
PETER It is. 

00:35:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, and one of the questions I have is with firearms and you're both knowledge with them and, and whether your own number you can talk about them. 

00:35:25
PETER Well, I have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. 

00:35:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uh-hmm. 

00:35:30
PETER I keep it on a box. 

00:35:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. What kind of gun do you have? 

00:35:35
PETER Uhm, I have 35 millimeter. And, uhm, I go to the pistol range every weekend. Uhm, and shoot. I like to target practice. Uhm, it's-- what else do you wanna know? I don't do that-- I don't hunt animals or deer. I did that with my father with the shotgun but I carry a 35. 

00:35:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Is it a pistol or revolver? 

00:36:00
PETER It's a revolver. 

00:36:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. When you target shoot do you use this big, ah, qualifying targets or do you go with the little ones or the little highlighting kind of things you can put on and what kind of target do you do? 

00:36:10
PETER You know, I got with the big piece of paper and then that kind of gets boring so I kind of make my own targets. 

00:36:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Yeah. What do you do? 

00:36:15
PETER Uhm, glass bottles just because it makes a big explosion and kind of you can see what you've done. 

00:36:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT With the like, colored water and stuff in it? 

00:36:25
PETER Colored water. 

00:36:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Cool. You stood out in the backyard? 

00:36:25
PETER No, I go to pistol range. My backyard, I'm, I'm in a residential area so... 

00:36:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT That will be front upon and you'll get arrested. 

00:36:30
PETER Well, I can be arrested for sure into my neighborhood. 

00:36:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. That's right. 

00:36:35
PETER Uhm, but I do, do that at the pistol range. 

00:36:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. So it's like an outdoor pistol range then or is it... 

00:36:40
PETER It's an outdoor. 

00:36:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:36:40
PETER Yeah. 

00:36:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I've only gone, uhm, a couple of times to pistol ranges and I've always been indoor. Uhm, so I just haven't seen the outdoor ones before. 

00:36:45
PETER No, no, it takes me up to outdoor. 

00:36:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, have you ever thought about using the gun, you know, in a, a situation with the professor? And you know you mentioned that you would lean towards someone else doing that for you... 

00:37:00
PETER Uhm, I use mine for protection in my home and like, where I go to school, I carry it. Uhm, just it gives me the safety. Have I thought about using it on somebody as a human? Ah, no, that thought-- I never thought of it that way. 

00:37:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:37:20
PETER You know, if I have to, yes I could. Uhm, I have used it before, you know, in self defense during Katrina, but, uhm, I remembered that feeling in the smell and I don't think I could do it out of anger, no. For self protection, yes, I could. 

00:37:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. So out of that trauma it's just so right there at the top for you. 

00:37:45
PETER Yeah. 

00:37:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:37:45
PETER And but I mean, to actually shoot somebody and to smell it and, ah, what-- ah, I don't know how to describe it, the sensation that you get is in-- it stays with you. 

00:38:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:38:00
PETER And to know that I did it out of a self defense cuz where I was living during Katrina it was martial law and I have been tried on this and was released for self defense. But it was that smell of the burning of the flesh going-- it stays with me. And even as angry as I can get, I don't think I could cause a person out of my anger who made me mad and shooting them. I can see that if there were threatening, or coming into my home or have threatened my life or my dogs or hit my home, yes, I could do it. 

00:38:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It sounds like you were pretty close to the person if you were able to smell the flesh as well with the... 

00:38:45
PETER Well, yeah. It was-- in New Orleans, I was-- I had broken into house and I claimed it as my own cuz I lost mine. And I was protecting two older women who had been hurt from this hurricane. And, uhm, when-- this is a hard part. 

00:39:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Let's, let's hold on that and... 

00:39:10
PETER Uhm, it's just when the storm-- that the prison lost power and so our every person that that was in the jail system was out, the rapist, the murderers, the kidnappers were all free. And you basically didn't care at that point. You, you did and hold and lift. And they were in my doorway coming into my building and shot him. And they were no further than me when I was sitting here. 

00:39:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. It, it strikes me, Peter, the-- again, the strength that you have managing this kind of stuff on your own. And I'm, I'm also frustrated to the therapist that you've tried to talk to before that have turned you away because clearly you know, you're, you're expressing things that could benefit from being talked about. And I'm, I'm hoping once again that you feel comfortable coming back in even later this week to talk with me about some of these things cuz they're powerful, uhm, powerful things that have hit you and, and I think, uhm, you're getting some of those out being able to talk about them will help you gain some peace, uhm, which I think is something I like you to have. Uhm, I mentioned some of the other questions I have kind of floating down. This one feels like it would relate as well, ah, a sense of sadness or depression or maybe to the even point of suicide, of thinking of killing yourself has that been, you know, something that's come across your mind too. 

00:40:35
PETER They've been there. Really there. 

00:40:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. 

00:40:35
PETER And, uhm, uhm, sadness a lot. Depression, I guess it goes with sadness. Uhm, suicide I think it's just-- it has always been part of-- since this whole experience with New Orleans, it's always been there just because I've, I've my own guilt, uhm, of why not me. 

00:40:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:40:55
PETER Uhm, but then I just think of what the-- I take bad that I've been through and there has to be something good that can come out of me. And that's the only thing, and I tell myself is that I don't have to define myself as that person. 

00:41:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:41:15
PETER You know, I can be somebody better if I can just change the way I think. That's... 

00:41:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Back to the counseling. Right. You know, trying to make yourself... 

00:41:25
PETER Well, I don't know at this point as I'm counseling or not. It's just-- I'm trying to figure out a way to change my thinking and, you know, try to find a better solution than, uhm, killing myself or killing somebody else and I know I heard it causing harm. There, there has to be something. 

00:41:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Trying some larger way to give back larger meaning and purpose. 

00:41:50
PETER I have to give this back somehow and I don't know how. So let's try to find that. 

00:41:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Well, I'd like to help you with some that. I really would. Uhm, a couple of other questions, ah, for today. Uhm, the issue, ah, of substance abuse is hard to ignore, you know, coming out of, uhm, that situation, coming out of that kind of trauma. Uhm, is that something that you struggled with before? Is that something on your... 

00:42:10
PETER I struggled or was I an addict? I did-- well, uhm, I never drink, I ne... 

00:42:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So it's a yes? 

00:42:20
PETER Yes, it's a yes. I self medicated. Uhm, I never drink or did drugs until I, until I lose Katrina. Uhm, I became-- I shut at crystal meth and heroine to get through those times. 

00:42:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Are you clean now? Have you been... 

00:42:35
PETER Yeah. I've been clean seven years which helps with a lot of the irrational thoughts that I had prior to my recovery. 

00:42:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Okay. Uhm, in terms of going back to class, what I'd like to see right now is just kind of the mediation between you and the professor to get you back into class. Uhm, I know you've had some anger towards her, uhm, some frustrations around the accommodation stuff. I, I can say pretty clear with you that, uhm, you know, she does have some responsibility to accommodate for you and I think we could talk with her about that to make sure that you're getting the accommodations that are legally afforded to you in that class. Uhm, and I'd, I'd like the dean of students to be a little more, uhm, active in the conversation with that professor to make sure that you have an advocate there. Uhm, and that's the kind of stuff that I think we can do for you. The stuff I'm gonna need from you is tough because I'd, I'd like to get you back in that class, I'd like to get you moving if you'd like to towards your degree, get you, you know, finished where you need to be. Uhm, but that requires you to, you know, work with me on some of this anger and some of these issues that are going on for you. So it's something you'd be willing to do. 

00:43:50
PETER Yes. 

00:43:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Okay. Okay. Uhm, I, I know the trauma stuff is gonna be prevalent, and you know, it's probably a place that will start, uhm, helping you talk about some of those stories and having you share some of those stories with me if you're comfortable. Uhm, I, I think that's hard to avoid. Uhm, you know, and, and, and the issue that I think will be useful for you to talk about. Uhm, so I would suggest, you know, maybe tomorrow if you have some free time, I'm not sure what your schedule is like, but, you know, having you come back and, and speak that up right, right away and talk a bit more. 

00:44:20
PETER Okay. 

00:44:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, I would also love to see pictures of your dogs. If you wouldn't mind bringing them in for me, I'd love to see, ah, Lucy and Serena. 

00:44:30
PETER No problem. 

00:44:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, yeah, for sure. Uhm, any questions for me, or any, ah, concerns that you have? 

00:44:35
PETER When do you think I would be able to go back into class? 

00:44:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, let's say from here, uhm, what I'll do is I'll talk to the dean of students right after our meeting. I'm gonna give her a call. Ah, I'm gonna make some suggestions about her talking with the professor. And the professor, his dean, to department head, around the accommodations issue and looking at that more closely. Cuz if you do have as you've said, then I believe you, uhm, these accommodations for the audio books since she was not able to work with you around those, we, we have to have a conversation with the professor about that. Uhm, in terms of the, the threats, in terms of what you said, uhm, I do think we have to have a conversation with you and the professor, probably with me present, maybe with the dean present around, uhm, getting pass that. Uhm, and whether that means an apology, whether that means, ah, I mean, you cope, ah, ah, I won't do this again, uhm, that I think has to be a starting place for the professor to feel comfortable having you back in class. 

00:45:20
PETER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT If she's not comfortable having you back in class, then we can look at some other options. We can look at any complete, we can look at having another professor take over and actually finish the course requirements that you might have depending on the class or we could look at switching into another section. Uhm, but I, I do think having someone in your corner to help you with these things would be useful. Uhm, so it's kinda where we would had from here. Does that sound all right? 

00:45:45
PETER All right. Sounds all right to me. 

00:45:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT All right. Well, thanks for taking the time to talk with me though. 

00:45:50
PETER Thank you. 

00:45:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I appreciate it. Peter did a wonderful job. Wow! 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:46:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT And you were nervous? Man, you knocked that out of the part. You're gonna have to travel with me now. Now that I knew you, you'll take me to New Orleans. You will-- we'll be good. We'll travel and talk. Oh, man. Uhm, so a powerful session. Uhm, maybe, ah, both Peter and I can kinda just give some basic reflections initially. Uhm, I don't wanna put you on the spot, but I could start-- you could start. I'll start. Uhm, for those of you watching, some of my thoughts going on with this, ah, as with almost every threat assessment I do, I don't start with the why did you call the professor a bitch and say you're gonna shoot her in the head with the fire arm, right. Cuz what does that do initially to every client ever? The defensiveness is through the roof, right? So you know, part of what we all know is counselors and, and, uhm, folks who do this kind of work is the importance of building report and getting a connection and, ah, proceeding slowly and, and carefully, uhm, and really trying to build from there. So I find that once we get the initial idea of why they're there, the chief complaint if you will, then we're gonna move fairly quickly into safer waters, uhm, to build that relationship up. Uhm, as the session went on, uhm, we've got in to the trauma stuff which was huge and unexpected for me. Uhm, usually doing threat assessments are not pulling them immediately into after care there, but I felt like giving this case that's where I would be and I would do some fighting for that. Now, ethically, in the back of the head, there's some, there's some problems with this, and here's what I would think through ethically, that while I'm being free to do the assessment I have never met Peter before I can do the assessment and then give my opinion back to the dean. After this if I'm then his treating therapist, I've kinda lost the ability to do future assessments with him. And I'm okay with that, right? Uhm, if they need him to assess again, if he then, you know, to another professor he's like, "I'm gonna help you now," too, then they're gonna have to call someone else in to do the assessment cuz now I've really shifted gears into the ongoing treating, uhm, clinician. And that, you know, gosh, that's just the nature of the beast, uhm, working in a school system, that just happen sometimes. And, uhm, that felt very natural to me and it felt like, it's very frustrated, I've heard that before from other clinicians like, your stuff is too much, or I'm not trained in his area and it, it often comes from a very good safe place from the clinician. But the message that have sensed to the client is, ah, horrific. And that in this threat assessment you can't ignore the trauma piece, the hopelessness attached to that, the lost that he's had, uhm, against this threat to the professor. That's, that's crucial I think in the violence risk profile. Uhm, and you know, at the end there's always that non sequitur piece. If you've ever done mental status exams, you know that experience of like, ah, crap, and ask about substance abuse and firearms. So, so I own it. You know, I say, hey, we're gonna ask some weird questions here. You know, have you ever seen things that other people haven't seen, you'd get to those kind of questions, kind of go through those, and you just kinda own that with the client. His overall assessment is complicated. Uhm, there's a lot of risk there for me. There's a, a, a sense of hopelessness, a sense of, "I've lost so much before, why would I care about this one professor?" Uhm, there's concern there for me. So again, this quick followup the day after, uhm, my feedback to the dean of students would be there's a lot going on with Peter. Uhm, I feel like we could do a mediation and get him back into class. But he would need to be in therapy weekly if not twice for the rest of the semester. And I, I love how it played out because it won't be a mandate, uhm, in getting into that whole mandated therapy, you know, issue. It's really him voluntarily I think coming in and, and doing some of that work. So that's in my head. Uhm, Peter, what, what was your take on this? How did you, ah, ah, experience this? 

00:49:35
PETER It's actually the first time I've actually talked about it in depth. 

00:49:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:49:35
PETER Uhm, this, this, this is the farthest conversation I've ever gotten besides I'm not qualified to handle anybody handling me, describes me, smelling somebody when I shot them. Uhm, they automatically I think I'm a convict or I should be put in jail. And it's like, you know, I have literally been tied to New Orleans and was released, that it was self-defense. Because of the time that it would-- had taken place so I've been relieved to that responsibility, but yet the responsibility of myself that I grew up never seen-- I would be the person that could never take another life and here I am opposing who took somebody's life. And I never thought I was that person. But being put in that situation, and my life that I never expected to be, I became somebody, and I think sometimes I'm still that person. And as much as I've tried to get help through that, I've never gone into-- and like I-- you said, this came out unexpectedly. 

00:50:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:50:35
PETER This was not an area that I was gonna go into because it's something that I protect. Uhm, build with my little demons in my own head that I, I carry with me. So, uhm... 

00:50:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I appreciate you sharing them. I mean, it came out very natural and honest and, you know, but halfway through the session I'm like, oh, geez, this is a lot. I felt like a lot of thing. 

00:50:55
PETER Do you mean to bomb... 

00:50:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT But-- no, it, it was good thought. I think it was, it was very natural. Uhm, therapeutically, I, I shift gears very quickly into my Michael White's work and Epston's work around narrative therapy and listening to the story, allowing them to tell the story then going back into it and having conversations with them around it. So I, I have a lot theor-- theoretical stuff kind of bumping around my head, a very-- a lot of natural connection to him. But always in the back of my head, and this is the difference when you're doing threat assessment, the importance of that list. You know, and, and if this felt like it was more immediate, and it felt like you couldn't be back in class and you couldn't have these discussions, uhm, then I think we would have shifted gears a little bit more. So that's a little bit for me to address. Uhm, some questions from you. What, what, what do you think? What do you wanna know from us? What-- would you do differently? Kind of an open forum of, of what you think. You guys can like ma-- max it out. 

00:51:50
 Well, I was just gonna as with the, with the police, ah, have already been informed with this, have already gone through that side when there's a specific threat to a specific person, would that have already happen and then this is a conversation later? 

00:52:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. That's a great question, and I'll repeat it for the, the audio. Uhm, would the police have been informed about this situation at this point? In this case, I'm gonna go with no. Uhm, because there wasn't a mention of weapons. This was a student in a class who made-- I would describe this is kind of a vague or valid threat. It wasn't, "I'm gonna kill you next week." A direct communicative threat with the high fixation and focus would be something like, you know, "Next week if you don't change my grade on this exam, you and I are gonna have problem and I'm gonna punch in the face." You know, and there's a time attached to it. So here it was kind of an explosive utterance. Uhm, and in my mind if you're interested in the threat assessment world, there's a great book by, ah, Calhoun and Weston I believe called Hunters and Howlers. And they make this argument that there's only two different kinds of people, there's people who explode and yell, the howlers, and that there's hunters, these are the people who are predatory and kind of keep it all in, ah, on their own. And that they really don't-- they-- it's a very tight tautology. There's not really-- ah, you can't, can't really be both if you're a hunter and you start yelling and you become a howler and, and vice versa. So you know, for Peter I felt like this was more of an explosive utterance that he had towards the professor. Now here's where it gets tricky, right. This always start pulling up kind of soft when we start thinking like gun, access, self-defense, conceal to carry, yet he's not directly gonna hurt the professor, yet hitman scenario too like-- but again, not directly tight to attacking the professor. There's a lot of vagueness to it. So for me, this is where I, I would wait him kind of moderate to hide. I would want quick and frequent follow up and I'd wanna kinda stay with this. Uhm, he would remind me of like a suicidal client who's not gonna kill themselves tonight, but someone that I really wouldn't feel great going on vacation to Hawaii. You don't want any catching up with them next week, like, he is someone I'd wanna follow up soon with because this could really change on a dime. There's a question here and then on the back. Yeah? 

00:54:05
 I was just thinking about being instructive though, that's become part of the issue in, in institution with child work. 

00:54:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

00:54:10
 And so I understand that the issue was offered, but then the possibility of returning to the class for notice, that's turned out the class, it's only my fellow faculty would be very concerned about that where they're, uhm, they're right to say, I mean, to do have more information or decision turning that. How does that fit with it? 

00:54:35
Assessing Risk Factors 1. Direct threat to person/place/system 2. Has tools, plans, weapons, schematics 3. Preoccupation with person/place 4. Action plan or timeframe to attack 5. Fixated/focused on target 6. Grudges/injustice collector 7. Pattern of negative writing/art 8. Leakage/warning of potential attack 9. Suicidal thoughts with plan 10. Talks about persecution/victim mindset 11. Last act behaviors 12. Confused thoughts/hallucinations 13. Hardened point of view 14. No options/hopeless/desperate 15. Drawn or pulled to action 16. Recent break up or stalking 17. Defensive/overly casual interview 18. Little remorse or bravado 19. Weapons access or training 20. Glorifies/studies violence 21. Disingenuous/externalize blame 22. Act superior/lacks empathy 23. History of impulsive risk taking 24. History of conflict (authority or work) 25. Extreme poor frustration tolerance 26. Trouble connecting/lacks trust 27. History of substance abuse/acting out 28. Mental health issues 29. Poor access to mental health 30. Objectification of others 31. Obsession with person/place 32. Oppositional thoughts/behaviors 33. Evaporating social inhibitors 34. Overwhelmed from loss (job, 

00:54:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Delicately. So the question is, how would faculty-- if the faculty were concerned about having someone like Peter return to the class? Where do they rights come in? Where is the-- where is their safety? Where is their, uhm, autonomy? And I, I think it's a delicate conversation. Uhm, to start, it would be a conversation with the faculty member and maybe their department head. The hope is we could go all, you know, Stephen Covey, and kinda get a collaborative win-win happening. That might not happen. But that's where I'd like to start. You know, having all to get together and, and move forward. And one of my favorite things to do is to bore faculty to death with lengthy conversations about fixation focus organization time and action imperative related to threat cuz then they're like, "Oh, Brian knows what he's talking about, so now I feel better." It's almost like a cop shows up with a uniform and a gun and you're like, "Oh, the police are here. They, they are in charge and they know what's going on." So if someone can have a conversation with the faculty member or the administration in an authoritarian-- authoritative knowledgeable kind of way to stress this is why we're moving to this kind of decision, we're not doing this arbitrarily. And this is why I developed the SIVRA-35 because a lot of administrators are making arbitrary decisions. They'd meet with someone like Peter and would be like, "Oh, my gut tells me he's kinda okay so I'm gonna go with that." And you know, the court doesn't like that very much, right? No, they don't. They don't. So with the SIVRA, you know, there's all these risk factors, it's like 35 of them, and if we go through this case, you know, with, with Peter, there's not really a direct threat. You know, it's kind of a vague threat. He does have access to weapons or concerned. I wouldn't say there's a preoccupation with this one professor. I think she tends to be the one in the, in the forefront right here but not, not to a point where he's really stalking or obsessed with her, but just because she's on his way. Uhm, no action or time imperative. There's not really a fixation and focus on this particular target. You know, we didn't get into too much of the grudging and the injustice collecting. I could tell when people bother him before. He would hang with that for a little bit, but there wasn't that kind of overarching feeling. So I would go through each of those risk factors. And then while I was making a decision or making recommendation to the dean, this is where I would build my argument from, uhm, and you never-- the problem with violence risk assessment is you never really gonna be able to predict with any degree of certainty. Uhm, you know, for example 75% of direct communicative threat, they never acted upon again. So if I say I'm gonna kill you with a handgun, 75% of the time I'll never say anything else to you again, I'll never threaten you again and I certainly won't take a handgun to kill you. Uhm, listen, I love Texas Holdem and I love chasing fleshes and straight, stay with me here. Uhm, if I get a 75% chance to win the hand, I'm feeling great about that. If someone threatens to kill me and there's a 25% chance that they might actually follow through with it, I'm still pretty scared. So, uhm, that knowing the statistics is important, but also and importantly kind of knowing the exceptions to the rule, so even though a direct communicative threat shouldn't be seen as a fate to complete towards a, a completed attack, it's still something high in that radar that we wanna be concerned with. That's why we would say with someone like Peter, follow up, work with him, eyes on, keep your friends your close, your enemies closer kind of scenario. Do you have a question? Yeah. 

00:57:35
 Uhm, there's a couple of things that I think that you also have to add you know and that is - 

00:57:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

00:57:40
 - you think the kind of soft which is, uhm, I already won't... 

00:57:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hey, I-- what time-- where-- hey, all right, excellent. 

00:57:50
 Because what you have is, ah, some states that some states that have it, some-- no wonder, self trying, our rule is if serve the time figuring it out without giving, you might wanna tell somebody that you don't have to, and the North Carolina rule is, uhm, when I am to talk about somebody you don't have that rule. And then there's one urge stage that have rule. So it-- so beyond that point you have to go back to what's the university college stated. It is there in any way that you can still stay in the program if there's a mediation with the student and the faculty, etcetera. So I think that's a really important piece in, in this case on top of the assessment in this. 

00:58:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Great. We have the should, they ought, the must, you know, and depending on the state of practice, you have to be really careful with that. And you know, having done mental status exams and suicide assessments for years, ah, you know, anyone I ask, "Hey, are you suicidal?" "Well, probably not." "Oh, you know, I can commit someone based on that." On the, on the-- you know, so it also depends clinically on how you're spinning, you know, your understanding of this. We could spin this as Peter and I have a great connection and we're, we're gonna move forward and gonna keep a real close eye in this or-- and other clinician could hear that and be like, he has a gun, and you know, he's had to use it and he's killed someone before, and he shot-- and we're very concerned and this is something we need to tell the professor. And then you tell the professor what they're freaking out, like, "Oh my God, he's gonna kill me now with the gun." 

00:59:10
 That's right. Because you also said that, of course, you're gonna do it today? You know, I've got this on three, probably to do today. Or whatever happened, let's hear it though. 

00:59:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Great. Great. So you said the connection tends to be. You know, I do trainings on violence and risk assessment. That's the big concept I share, is that connection with the client in ongoing ways. Really, it's management. Right? That's the really only way you're gonna stay connected with, with the situation. Great question. Yeah, for sure. 

00:59:40
 So is there some kind of research on, uhm, a group of people who respond to these questions? I mean, you say, you know, I've never thought about, uhm, using your gun on this professor. Well, gosh, I mean, does he even say, well, yeah, I really have. I mean, what do you think of about that? 

00:59:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Ah, that's a beautiful question. Deception detection and how you work that into an interview. And let me just say this as, ah, sort of like just watching Brian do this should not give anyone in the room the confidence to go like, "I'm gonna go to at threat assessment. This is gonna be excellent and start up a new, like, practice." You need more training. Uhm, and there's entire areas dedicated to deception detection that show lie to me. You know, it talks about like how we look at facial features and how that-- uhm, I love information. Uhm, and that's what I'm gathering doing this. So there's times I think where you looking at Brian asking a question and him just kind of nodding like in that Rogerian way like, hmm, yeah, so that's fascinating. And in my head, different stuffs going on like, "Is he lying? Or is he telling the truth?" But to the client, all he's getting from me is, "Tell me more. That's fascinating. I want that report built." So as I'm going back to that, uhm, I wanna have a high index of suspension in terms of deception around this. As I hear more of the story though, doesn't it give me the context to tell me really early on that I think he was pretty honest? Uhm, but just asking that question which I did kind early on, uhm, shouldn't be seen as, ah, "Oh, this must be he's telling the truth." So there's the opportunity like Columbo, uhm, Peter Falk, ah, if you see on YouTube, ah, it's worth it. Uhm, you can look them off. It's got-- he has this way of like kinda being this trampled, uhm, the trench coded detective who kinda asks people questions. And a lot is that he's that kinda, "Oh, one more thing." That like he always has stuff going on in his head. So absolutely you have to always be bouncing with the client saying back on the validity, you know, wall, what sticks all that and that and what falls to the floor, right? What stays, uhm, and what's accurate? Now, with someone like Peter, if there is a more direct threat, uhm, maybe I would have had him do the MMPI-2 to begin with and then I'm watching the PK scale go up and watching some authority scales go up on four. You know, the MMPI-2 for example is not really designed as a forensic assessment, but it's a great broad based, tell me something about them. It also is what 10 or 11 scales dedicated to validity and how they're approaching attack. So there is information there that's good. Uhm, the Paulhus deception scale is another great scale that you could use. It goes back to this. Uhm, the John Saxe poem, the blind men from Indostan. Anyone remember this poem? There's five blind men. They've have never seen an elephant before. One comes up and touches the elephant and touches the leg and they say, "Oh, an elephant is like this. It's like a tree trunk." One touches the ear and says, "No, no, an elephant is like a fan." One touches the trunk, "No, an elephant is like a snake." One touches the side, "An elephant is like a brick wall." There's no bad information from the client. So while I'm gonna-- I might gather some testing information, like the MMPI-2, like the Paulhus deception scale, ah, maybe the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory, maybe the full range of the Beck series, do the BDI, do the BSS, do the BHS, do the BAI. I'm gonna throw some stuff out of them before you even comes into my office. But I have to take all the information in context. I don't wanna really touch the elephant in the wrong way and get the wrong information. But I wanna be hungry for information from the client. Yeah. 

01:02:50
 If you transition him in to you becoming the treatment provider - 

01:02:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

01:02:55
 - quickly in that way, then if something ever went to court, you're gonna be screwed because you can't be the expert witness. You have to be the treating provider and yet initially you were the evaluator. And I'm, I'm trying to place when I do with-- in a different scenario to carry the way you do, I mean, I'm in the, I'm in the private practice but, but there's no... 

01:03:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

01:03:25
 I've never been the treatment provider unless something goes to court right away, it's completely over and for some reason I'm not the person that would do it. 

01:03:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sure. 

01:03:35
 Which hopefully I'm not. But I wonder, does that happen to you? 

01:03:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Let me, uhm, talk about how it would not be completely screwed in this scenario. That's a great question. How do I, you know, juggle this difference between being the threat assessor and the treatment provider. And ideally in the demonstration series, that wasn't my favorite thing to-- like halfway through, I'm like, well, this is, this is gonna create a whole bunch of questions for folks, but that's what naturally felt like, it was the way I should have gone with it. Uhm, what would happen is I was initially the evaluator, I did the threat assessment, I would do a formalized writeup, I would give my recommendations to the dean of students, and in fact, I would have to give it to Peter first. I'd have to give my red pen and say, "Why do you think?" And I'm gonna have a conversation with him. We're gonna agree to it and then we're gonna get to the dean and then he's gonna see them and we're gonna have a meeting. And then from there on, that's where I shift gears and that's where I become the treatment provider. Now here's where I would get screwed, right? If then Peter did something else that was concerning and threatened someone else and then I jumped back into the role of the evaluator, then my ethics code, the newly, uhm, formed 2014 ethics code for ACA, right, uhm, says that we can't do that because I'm biased now, because now I'm the treatment provider. So I did rob Mary to pay Paul. In that situation, I said, "Now I'm going to no longer assess him. This was my one and only assessment, now I'm done. Now gonna shift gear to the treatment providing. If he needs another assessment it's gonna have to be with someone else." You need to have that clear delineation. Uhm, you can't do it the other way. I can't have in treating Peter for a long time and then someone asked me to assess him, and I'll go here we go, I can give my opinion and I can give, you know, a writeup and a letter of support, but from giving the opinion that it's an unbiased assessment of Peter, it's none cuz he's my client. And I care for him. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:05:15
 I have maybe missed this, but, uhm, it sounds like you've been really going to mental history as far as giving the diagnosis before through clinicians. 

01:05:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Sometimes it was time wise. Uhm, you know, if you were to put me on the spot, I'm saying we're looking at PTSD for sure. Uhm, a lot of the, the smells, the taste, the-- like all of that was there so I, I think it would be hard to argue that. Uhm, and that, that to me is prevalent. I mean, that-- when I did differential diagnosis and when teaching graduate school, I get to talk people at the court issue that's kinda where you start. It's hard to avoid the PTSD not be in the core to this. Maybe there's some impulsive and control stuff, maybe there's some personality stuff with why he would seek, but all of it seems to tie back to that central issue. And that's why I think I felt like so drawn towards the treatment provider piece, especially since previous providers were like, "This is too much for me." So you know, that's kind of why I made that decision in the moment to stay connect with him. And in the school environment, that, that works better. He was in private practice and this was all I did was assessments and I didn't do treatment, then, then I think I'm going to make a different decision there, but maybe not, maybe I would have had the same kind of feeling. So, uhm, we have, we have some-- for sure, there's the all the, uhm, varies, uhm, definitely some depression. Uhm, maybe you know, some suicidality there too, is that separate from the, the PTSD or not. But here's the, the real important point, and this was one that I argue with my editors for this harm to self and others, uhm, in August that's come out, was, uhm, people wanted it to become a mental health treatment guide. I'm like, no, here it's two things, it's one is how to do violence risk assessments and threat assessments and then how to treat people based on-- and I pull that all the stuff I love like I've mentioned you know, in Epston in narrative therapy and strength based and existential in Yalom. I pulled out all the stuff that I use with clients who have made threats to people that actually help them get better. Uhm, but it's assuming now that there's a mental health issue that I'm kind of jumping into. And in Peter's case there is, uhm, and other cases that might just be anger towards authority figures. So the mental health stuff might fade. So, uhm, but I'm not doing, and this is what they wanted in the book, they'll go, "Well, Brian, let's write up a diagnostic history and the treatment plan," and I'm like, hmm, that's, that's little different here, right? We're not-- we're borrowing from some of that, but I'm not diagnosing him here. I'm not doing the psychosocial eval, I might use some of the same tools, I might use the MMPI, I might use some tests, and my end product is really an opinion about this violence risk to others not diagnostic. If that make sense. It, it is a shift, and it's a, it's a brilliant question, one that's ha-- I think the question for counselors in the field cuz like when we do this kind of treatment and evaluation and we do this all the time-- right, yeah, exactly. Uhm... 

01:07:55
 That's all I can say. 

01:08:00
[sil.] 

01:08:05
 Uhm, I work with mandated batterer intervention and I do a lot of... 

01:08:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sounds like an easy job. Yeah. 

01:08:15
 This is-- yes, kind of that department. And, and it means that they're be asking, you go that pretty hot. So do you have assessments for that, uhm, well and in your baggage? 

01:08:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT For what specifically? 

01:08:30
 Batterer intervention, domestic violence, uhm, knowing if they are going to reoffend. I mean, that's the whole point with for the courts - 

01:08:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. 

01:08:40
 - they wanna see-- they saying repetitive specifically with rights. So, I mean, they're not going to jail for a lot of our guides, their first time offenders that they got caught. 

01:08:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

01:08:50
 Not that they are stating that it's the first time that they have done this. 

01:08:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Great. The first they've been caught. 

01:08:55
 Uhm, but that they may not never go to jail and so probation says, hey, there if you were, and we know that the name stopping in physical violence and emotional threats and the emotional, uhm, I believe that they fit their partner during that. 

01:09:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Let me answer your question in two ways. One will be, uhm, a quick easy reference and the other would be, uhm, on a sharing in scale. So the first is I love Hart's work. Uhm, he has formed something called the HCR-20. It's history, clinical and risk. It's from Canada. Uhm, so we love Canadians. They do good work. Uhm, I can-- can you tell me one-- any Canadians in the audience? Can you tell me one Canadian joke? How do you get 50 Canadians out of a pool? You just ask him. They are so nice. I love it. Uhm, so Hart is, is a, a friend and, and a colleague and, and someone who's been doing this for like 30 years and his work, uhm, Proactive Solutions, it's a company he runs, he does threat assessment trainings. I went to his training on structured professional judgment, SPJ in, ah, Edinburgh, Scotland. So when I wasn't, uhm, at the, uhm, whiskey bars, uhm, tasting whiskeys and scotches in Edinburgh, I was listening to Hart. And it was amazing, uhm, and really good, uhm, this idea of kind of, ah, almost the case management, how to work with people. So the HCR-20 is good. It looks at outpatient and it's more of a violence risk assessment and that it looks at people who are kind of known by the court, and then try to make decisions about what's next for them. There was a batterer program called, I think, SARA. I wanna say, S-A-R-A. Uhm, that's a very good clinical tool. Uhm, so that's where I would, I would go. Now here's the depressing part. Uhm, I was recently-- again, my ACA editors. Just one issue. Uhm, my ACA editors were like, "Brian, for the book, can you write, you know, a couple more pages on liability for counselors who are doing threat assessment cuz there's a huge liability isn't there." And I'm like, yes. Uhm, you can get sued for anything. There you go, how's that? Uhm, so they wanted me to write more than and I was like, why I was going through it. And found, you know, Harris Klebold, uhm, the column editors, and, and one things, I don't know if you know this detail, uhm, ah, ah, was it Harris? It was Harris. Uhm, up a-- like, in February prior to the April attack of that year had just completed the court diversion program and all the notes are there and I was reading through them and it's just like everything we've ever written are seen, right, like Erick is doing really well and it's-- and he wrote like the thing about his anger management. He's like, I've learned some great things in this anger management program, I've learned how to identify my triggers and how to-- it will be like what we'd want from all of our clients to write. Three months later, he does the killing. So what do we do? Uhm, I think we do the best that we can. Uhm, we stay in empirical val-- empirically validated treatments, we stay in trained situations, we learn more, we learn different tools, it's-- again, I said, they hang out with lawyers a lot. Uhm, it's a belt and suspender situation. Have you heard that? This is like a lawyer saying and it's really cool and you use it all the time, I love it. Uhm, if you can't, or you're trying to stay up, right? You use a belt and suspenders. And, ah, it's a cool concept that kind get stuck in my head of like. So it shouldn't just be this, like you don't wanna disturb onto site on Peter and give him opinion at the end of this violence risk. You also wanted to do the clinical interview and you also wanna meet with them again. And often times, threat assessments are one or two or three sessions to really get to all the questions of mental health and all of these other pieces too. Uhm, but as terms of the batterers, uhm, those were some tools I might use to get to that as well. Yeah. 

01:12:15
 This closely are very significant for all the times we screwed. 

01:12:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

01:12:20
 And so I'm just curious with the (inaudible ) and alcohol (inaudible ). 

01:12:26
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Uhm, I have this terminator kind of thing that, obviously, a terminator movement like little-- the hod comes up, right, and you have all the little computer things and that's how I get in my head when I'm doing that kind of treatment and assessment. So my little thing comes up in front of me and I see all the little lines and the red lights. So what I have over here is like the blinking light like, okay, crystal meth, hero-- like, oh, that's serious, we are worried about that, right? Cuz there's some violence attached to it, there's some concern attached to it. Yet we don't over here like sobriety, you know, seven years. So I'd want to the next session get into some of the sobriety talks if he has the sponsors as we're doing a program, harm reduction, AA, uhm, but I do wanna see substance abuse as a risk factor. In fact, the big strongest factor for violence in terms of impulsivity. And in fact, the one that we're concerned with, I think it's like item 20 something on the SIVRA, uhm, this idea of, of, uhm, especially things like methamphetamines that would kind of take people away from good decision making. Uhm, it could be a higher risk so that would definitely be something that would work on if I were to do a treatment plan. And that in my letter, I'd write a one page letter based on this and in the back of that letter I have five or six different areas that I would continue to explore. One would be mental health, one would be the gun and weapon access, one would be some of the trauma stuff, maybe a medical referral, we didn't really ask about medications, uhm, and certainly, substance abuse following up with that how, how it is that. So, yeah, excellently. Another question. Yeah, please. 

01:13:45
 (inaudible ). 

01:13:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

01:13:55
 Uhm, with the gang violence (inaudible ) so, who, who will you take on for assessment in all of the public highschool or counseling kids would be too large so... 

01:14:05
SIVRA 35 Brian@ncherm.org http://nabita.org/resources/sivra-35 

01:14:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I think having some kind of tool to fall back upon, yeah, I've mentioned the SIVRA a couple of times and I'll, I'll put the, the contact information on the screen, you can check it out. Uhm, that's the one I develop for college population. Uhm, there's other tools out there, there's the Waiver 21 which was developed by Meloy, uhm, there is the HCR-20 which I mentioned, there's ah, ah, fancy one called Mosaic which is a little more involved. But I think having some list of risk factors that you're going through and you have this conversation with students, uhm, is really important. Uhm, and in handouts for this session online, there is that list of all this-- the 35 SIVRA factors. If you just have that, I feel like you're at least ahead of the game a little bit cuz when you do the assessment, even in a quick session you're thinking about all this kind of thing. So like for example if the student just broke up with the girlfriend or a boyfriend and had a sudden relationship lost, that's something we should have on our mind, right, that there's factors that are intrinsic to the person, maybe isolation or separation or no positive social connections, the scaffold thing that supports them kind of falls away but then we have like a relationship trauma, right? Or we have substance abuse or we have easy weapons access or we have glorification and violence. We know the shooter from, uhm, Northern Illinois University's Steven Kazmierczak had two tattoos on his arm, one was a skull with a knife in it and the other one was a picture of the, ah, saw killer, jigsaw, from the movie kind of wheeling through on a tricycle filled with blood. You can look at it on, ah, Google. Now, and all that tattoos. I don't think tattoos are like a huge risk factor especially with gangs, uhm, in the different cultures, tattoos have different meanings. I can tell you without a doubt though if you go up to someone and you're like, "Hey, man, what's your tattoo mean?" What do they say? Well, let, let me tell you. Like this one I got then and this is what it means, this is my four kids and this is when they're born. So... 

01:15:50
 Right. But for gangs though, that's a different kind of tattoo. They've got to using reporting problem but that's, that's... 

01:15:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT But that means something to the person, right? Yeah. I mean, it's not where, you know, it's not like I've got my degree or these are my kids. But if you ask a gang member what is tattoos are about, they all have a story, and that's what I'm getting to. So I mean, engaging with that person, having that connection with them and having a list of risk factors that you're following back on gives you I think a solid or ground to stand on when it comes to doing this kind of assessments. Uhm, because what you don't wanna have happened, and this is I think the danger with the counselor being thrown into, hey, see if these kids gonna kill anyone. You know, you meet with them for half hour, and you're like, "Ah, I don't-- probably not." Like, that's not where you wanna be, you wanna say, based on these 35 risk factors. Uhm, they have two, right? Or based on these 35 risk factors, they have 29. So then you're gonna do a followup based on the research and the literature rather than you kinda get instinct on it. Anyone just got instinct. We're usually right. But we wanna have a backup plans that when we get sued, uhm, we have something that we showed our work, like geography, right? Like, that you just kind of write the answer at the bottom, you have to say got that. 

01:17:00
 So, so, when you refer to an administrator with the issue, you know, it's like the escalation of performance so there's a little threat. It's just that we believe that the level of threat is pretty higher and you make sure you refer it to higher levels in your school system. 

01:17:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Then you're looking at sometimes forensic psychologist, forensic counselors, people have additional training. And I don't think that's all counselors. Some people are gonna get better and more intensive training. We offer that training at NaBITA. Well, right. You know, and then we're looking at the highschools developing, you know, uhm, threat assessments to use where people then get some of those expertise, a tap to NaBITA, two places I do these trainings, ah, each year as well. I think I'll have like two more questions if we can, uhm, or maybe three. There's two people. Let me-- you guys are so many so I'm get you third, hold on, hold on. But let me get you, since I didn't ask you here and then here. Yeah. 

01:17:45
 Well, so my question about the ranking instability, you said that. 

01:17:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

01:17:50
 And in terms of working with the instability scenario like the teacher or the instructor part of it, where, where does that come in for future-- this future process? Do you have those ramification? Do you have that, uhm, interaction? I know you work for the instructor, but future instructors to make sure that they're getting to this guidelines. 

01:18:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. Absolutely. And that's why I love threat assessment, that you know, for someone taking on in the treatment capacity someone like this that you've already taken-- ah, even in mandated counseling, it's another topic I talk about. I think good mandated counseling then becomes advocacy very quickly. It's like how do we work with you to kinda Prochaska and Diclemente change theory in motivational interviewing. We use all of this different techniques to become an advocate for our client. So absolutely with Peter one of the things I'm having in my terminator face shield this LD stuff and making sure that this doesn't happen again. How do we reduce-- I'm doing two things, all right. On this hand, I'm reducing the threats and the frustrations and the things that get him to that trigger point where it snaps. And on this hand, I'm building up his resiliency, right? I'm ha-- I'm listening to his story, I'm helping him cuz he have some great stuff, right? He has the stuff about the garden, and his dogs and the support, and how can we get him some different friends and connections and how-- the sobriety in seven years. I mean, there's some really great strengths shouldering both, or kind of lowering the trigger events that might occur around the school talking to other professors advocating for him and also helping, you know, reaffirm the good stuff that he has and helping him branch out from there. So I'm talking about in the third person, Peter. 

01:19:20
PETER That's right. But that I would like to add though as far as my university is with disability services. When they tested me, they determined this is what I need to learn. Every class that I take, I have the same-- my accommodations don't change. That these are what I need. Every professor that I see or every class that I take, they have to sign this agreement that this is what they'll allow me to have. It was this one particular professor who ha-- well, there's been a couple, but one that speci-- specifically said, "No, you can't have any of this accommodations in my class, so why are you in my class?" But all the professors have accommodated at this point to what the letter says and have agreed to say. Because it's, it's from the, the de-- from the school. And it's not-- and you know, and they-- what I've been told is that the, the professors have-- once they have signed it, they have to. That's my contract with them to allow me to learn. So that has changed, uhm, in my-- for my case. 

01:20:20
 Right. I mean, there would be and possibly could be the professional against that instruction because they want you against the feasibility as out that. 

01:20:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Right. Although that gets trickier than that cuz then on the flip side you might have a situation where it's a, a competency for the field that can't be shifted, like nursing or ed where they can't, there's no accommodation, you need to give it a lift this much or have certain eyesight, you know, these are more obvious example. So it's tricky, and that's where I think what Peter needs more than anything as an advocate who's helping him, case manager is another word for that, by the way, you know, social worker, who could help him navigate the system when he runs into professors like this cuz they're certainly better outcomes that could have happened besides her saying no. Uhm, both from the school's perspective in terms of risk mitigation and, and Peter's experience. Yeah. 

01:21:05
 I think that it was a frustrating (inaudible ) I'm working in the university setting as well and in my school, if you have to sign up in a congregation, that professor don't have to leave where he'll just say, "No, it's not gonna happen here.". 

01:21:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Are you implying professors sometimes do things on their own? Really? 

01:21:25
 But the other thing that I think is frustrating is why are they even working, you know. 

01:21:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

01:21:30
 That to me, you don't wait until it's failed the courts and then say, well, to matter. 

01:21:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Right. Especially of course there only has two great points, right? Especially those kind of courses. Yeah. I wanna be sensitive to time. We have two more questions here and here and then we'll both hang around. 

01:21:45
THE NEW ORLEANS INTERVIEWS Brian@ncherm.org http://nabita org/resources/nolainterviews/ 

01:21:45
 So tell me here to address but it was pointed out but I wanted to ask about right now the components that you report to the school... 

01:21:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, what I'll say is grab a card, uhm, that I have on the table over there. I, I did something called the New Orleans Interview. Totally random. I went to New Orleans. It was an old fire house and we rented it out and we, we taped two threat assessments. And what I have there is the transcripts for those threat assessments, two video demos, uhm, as well as the sample reports that I would write. And if are you interested in what the reports look like, just throw me an email, I'll just send you those. If you want the whole thing, if you work for a big system, and it's all this money they wanna throw at, uhm, you can buy the whole thing. But if you just want a sample letter that's the kind of what I would write, the cases are Dustine and Stacy. So just grab a card off that table and I'll, I'll send that to your way, for sure. Yes, take us home. 

01:22:40
 Uhm, well, I just want to know how you address in this system and process that you're describing the cultural issues that assume come up. 

01:22:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, the issue of cultural issues and that can come up with, uhm, different backgrounds, different socioeconomics, the different, uhm, international, ah, language, uhm, death culture, uhm, ADA, mental health. I mean, you name it. Uhm, so how do I approach that really quickly? Uhm, sometimes I just happen to have connections to certain things like New Orleans is like my soul city so I, I have an initial connection with the client that helps. If you don't know anything about New Orleans, then you have to be, and this is what I would do if I didn't. You have to be in a position of learning from the client. Uhm, and you saw me do that a little bit at the end bringing in a picture of your dogs, let me-- you wanna encourage the client to share things about themselves. When I work with college kids, one of my favorite things to do would be like, "Hey, burn a CD for me," and I know, like, ethics, or like, you're asking them for like a gift and, "No, I want them to burn a CD for me," right? And I wanna hear some of their music. I wanna get to know things from their perspective. I started out doing child and family therapy. And it was a great excuse to go to Toy Are Us every month and like buy Pokemon cards and like get Plato and like my uno skills are like tight. Right? Uhm, so if you're working with a certain population that you don't know anything about them, be curious, be voyeuristic, be warming from them, what, what they're about, you know, learn about them. Uhm, the most cool thing that, you know, learn about Kesha and Miley Cyrus and like, one of my clients introduce me to Amanda Palmer, I'm like, "Oh, I love Amanda Palmer." Like, I would never have also known these things. It's very karmic as well I learn things especially about music from my client. So be curious I think is the best thing I could say. Uhm, and if you're ignorant about a particular culture or an experience, uhm, that curiosity I think is, you know, "Teach me, I wanna know." Uhm, that's where I would start. 

01:24:35
 Well, I wasn't really asking that question. 

01:24:35
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Oh, man. That's such a good answer though. Oh, what was your question again? Tell me. 

01:24:40
 Well, uhm, I don't know really how to articulate it very well. I'm kind of wondering about, you know, you've been with all these instruments. 

01:24:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yes. 

01:24:45
 And... 

01:24:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Normative sampling for the instruments? 

01:24:50
 Yeah. Like how, how do we do when the person in front of you is not in anything a speaker. Ah, you know, you have the resources to really test people that don't fall under all the... 

01:25:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT No, I mean, I'm not gonna use the MMPI-2 and subject them to 567 questions if they don't understand English. Or if they have it, if they have ADD and they're like, "I can't do that," then... 

01:25:10
 When you think it ended in a smash, but you still might not wanna subject somebody - 

01:25:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah. 

01:25:15
 - to that. 

01:25:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Or you just hate this test. If he was a lot more angry, he's very accommodating and, and easy to work with. If he was a lot more defensive and have to hire hostility push back, having that person even start the interview by taking 20 minutes of test, even the Beck series would have been too much. So I think you have to be careful, uhm, in those situations. With that, that being said, one of my favorite test to use was the AUI, uhm, the alcohol use inventory, with college students which is nowhere near with the AUI is norm for, it's norm for like 45-year-old alcoholics where my chronic-- ah, ah, but the test was kinda cool because college students took it, kinda grab little pieces of it and actually became a new treatment tool for me with students. You know, talk about precarious drinking styles versus, uhm, depressed or anxious drinking styles. There's some neat stuff within that test. So, uhm, the quality of life inventory as well as one that I'll use occasionally with college students, so, you know, the thing with the testing is you have to have a reason that you're giving it that's actually gone tie into that treatment outcome or give you some really useful assessment information, not just cuz you have it you can use it. Uhm, so you, you have to certainly be careful with some of the normative rules around the test in making sure that you're not, A, hurting the client, you know, by putting them through this extra stuff, or B, using the wrong tool for the, the task at hand. That's probably the worst here. Oh, all right, well. Uhm, thanks again for your attention. I appreciate it. Yeah. That's true. And, uhm, if I can just break it for a minute, and now let's direct all the applause to Peter who knocked this out of the part. Great job, man. Great job, man.
