RICHARD HILL Hi, I'm Richard Hill, and I've been pondering a deep, but fundamental question. Who, or what, is a human being? How we respond to that query has implications for almost everything we do. And over the next half hour or so, I'd like to examine what it means for us as counselors and mental health practitioners, helping clients to achieve the desired changes in their lives. Now specifically, given what we understand about the nature of human beings, what can the different schools of psychology and counseling modalities tell us about how to help change habit. Well, are we human because we think? Rene Descartes, his famous statement, cogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am. Well that would suggest that if thinking is what sets us apart as human beings, then the psychologies that most greatly help clients change would be those that look at the way they think. Then again, what about our emotions? If you look at cognition, but fail to take feelings into account, are we not missing some vital clues to what is happening for the client, and what might therefore affect change? Yet other counseling modalities believe that they cut to the chase by not even attempting to focus on thoughts and feelings, but rather, they say, by changing maladaptive behaviors of clients, and then the rest will, sort of, fall into line. And we cannot ignore those psychologies which insist that we human beings are our behavior, our emotions, our thoughts, and more. Now, if we don't look at who is choosing to act, to feel and think, such psychologies say, then we have failed to examine the most inclusive sense of human beingness, and our change efforts have missed the mark. Not only that, but we must also take time to account for the capacity, the felt need in human beings, to change through connection to something more, or something larger than ourselves. Well that made us form the development of transpersonal psychologies, which acknowledge that we will not truly understand ourselves until we comprehend our place in the universe. That is, amongst all other beings, and in respect to the cosmic energy that runs through all of creation. So we set for ourselves a gargantuan task. But in the time we have today, I'd like to look briefly at some of the main therapies of psychology. 

00:03:00
What is it about a counselling process that makes people change? 

00:03:05
RICHARD HILL In specifics, what is it about a counseling or psychotherapy process that makes people change? In other words, what are the mechanisms of psychotherapy? I'd also like to look at what the paradigm supporting a given school of psychology assume about the nature of human beings, and therefore how they can change. What are the main concepts of a given psychology? Who are famous proponents of a given psychology? And with what kind of client issues does a given psychology naturally sit well. So whether you're a counselor, psychotherapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or simply a lay person with an interest in mental health issues, it's helpful to be clear on what different psychologies assume, and what, therefore, they can offer the client and the therapist. So, let's first look at the mechanisms of therapy.

RICHARD HILL Psychologist Raymond Corsini and psychiatrist colleague Gina Rosenberg searched through 300 articles to identify the critical elements for helping people achieve desired change. They found 220 statements about change, and performed a factor analysis on them, identifying nine factors, three each under the umbrella categories of cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors. So, cognitive factors. Under the category of change, by virtue of helping clients change how they think, they were the factors of universalization. Clients improve when they realize that they are not alone, that others have similar problems, and that human suffering is universal. Insight. When growth occurs as clients increasingly come to understand themselves and others, and gain different perspectives on their own motives and behavior. Modeling. People benefit from watching other people. A client may model himself or herself on the therapist. There are also affective factors. Let's look at acceptance. This factor reflects the sense of getting unconditional positive regard, especially from the therapist. Altruism. Change can result from recognizing that one is the recipient of the love and care of the therapist or other members of the group, or from being the one who provides love and care to others, as well as feeling that he or she is helping others. Transference. This factor identifies the emotional bond that occurs between the therapist and the client, or between clients in a group setting. And the third category of factors was behavioral factors. Reality testing. Change becomes possible when clients experiment with new behaviors in the safety of the therapy session, receiving support and feedback from the therapist and other group members. Ventilation. The factor that speaks to the value of blowing off steam, through crying, shouting, you know, other catharsis events, in an environment in which the person can still feel accepted, safe. Interaction. Clients improve when they are openly able to admit to the group that there is something wrong with themselves or their behavior. In the days when Corsini and Rosenberg did their study, transpersonal psychologies were not as popular as they are now, so they didn't even have a separate category or factor for those types of change statements. Now, for our purposes today, I'll divide the world of psychological theories, and there's over 400 known types. Let's put them into four main classes. Cognitive and or behavioral. Psychoanalysis, psychodynamic, analytical. Humanistic. And transpersonal. In talking about the different schools, I'll state who the main proponents or developers are, or were, what some of the chief assumptions and concepts are, and what types of client issues tend to sit well with the modality. We'll move from relatively narrower paradigms to those which deal more in the fullness of the human being. Of course, not all psychologies fit nicely into these categories. But firstly, let's take the well known group of cognitive and or behavioral psychologies. 

00:07:35
Cognitive and/or behavioral Psychologies 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:40
Behaviorism (Ivan Pavlov, B. F. Skinner, and Albert Bandura) 

00:07:40
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, or REBT (Albert Ellis) 

00:07:40
Cognitive Therapy (Aaron Beck) 

00:07:40
Cognitive Behavior Therapy, or CBT (an offshoot of REBT and Cognitive therapy, by Beck and Ellis) 

00:07:40
Reality Therapy (William Glasser) 

00:07:40
Change your thoughts and behavior, change your life 

00:07:45
RICHARD HILL In this group we can include the following, behaviorism, Ivan Pavlov, B. F. Skinner, Albert Bandura. Rational emotive behavior therapy, or REBT, the late great Albert Ellis. Cognitive therapy, with Aaron Beck. Cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT, which is really an offshoot of REBT and cognitive therapy, in the work between Beck and Ellis, a few decades ago. And reality therapy, by again, the late, great William Glasser. The way these psychologies work, is that they change your thoughts and behavior, and change your life. Counseling schools of the cognitive behavioral sort tend to claim that how you behave and what you do can be determined by what you believe or the way you think. When clients think in negative, limited, or unhelpful ways, therefore, most of these modalities see it as the therapist's job to spot the irrational language or the behavior, and help the client to exchange it, for thoughts which are more helpful, less constraining to the client's life, and more able to generate moderate emotions. Strict behaviorism works with conditioning, through rewards and punishment, to help the client increase helpful behaviors and beliefs, and to extinguish the maladaptive ones, through a lack of reward. So, therapy using these psychologies is directive and fairly structured. It's usually relatively short term and goal oriented. Tasks are often given to clients in the form of homework in order for them to effect change in their behavior, which eventually become second nature to them. In the course of examining the changing negative thought patterns, beliefs, and behaviors, clients' attitudes undergo a re-education. The counselor is thus an educator, working in collaboration with client to help them adopt straight thinking strategies. The focus is on working with thinking and acting rather than on expressing feelings. The founder of REBT, Albert Ellis, and the founder of CBT, Aaron Beck, were both trained in the tradition of psychoanalysis, but sensed that something was missing in that therapy. Beck went on to notice that his depressed clients used a lot of negative self-talk, in reference to their depression and their world view. Thus a client might believe without any evidence, for example, that a particular friend said no to an invitation because she did not like the client, who might then act standoffish or cool towards the friend. The client would in this case be using assumptions not backed up by truth as a basis for behavior, which could very well then attract the presumed reality, that the friend might, in response to the client's new behavior, really come to have feelings of dislike. Ellis' writing has described how clients tend to hold irrational belief patterns that generate strong emotions. Shoulds, and musts were often the basis for these, such as, people should treat me with respect, or, I must have approvals from so and so in order to feel okay about myself. Such irrational beliefs generally lead to disappointment because the world at large cannot live up to such expectations. Well, in a somewhat similar vein, reality therapy also seeks behavioral change. but here the reason for changing behavior is to gain greater need satisfaction. Reality therapy asserts that people enter counseling or therapy because something has gone wrong with their lives. They are not fulfilling their needs effectively, and thus feel discomfort, anxiety, depression, guilt, fear, or shame. Reality therapy is based on control theory, a system of brain functioning, which states that the human brain functions like a thermostat, in that it seeks to regulate its own behavior, much like an air conditioner, in order to change the world around it. Adapted to become useful in a clinical setting, reality therapy contends that all human behavior is motivated by the fulfilment of the same four psychological needs, for belonging, power, fun, enjoyment, and freedom, as well as the physical need of survival. Effective satisfaction of the needs results in, what can be referred to as self-actualization, or becoming a fully functional person. Reality therapy has been compared to REBT and CBT, and while there are significant differences, all three psychologies share the principle that outside forces do not cause stress, depression, anxiety or other disturbances. It's the reaction of people to events that causes strong emotion or distress. And also, the therapies overlap in the understanding that is focus on the current life, and the emphasis on the past is not so useful. Cognitive and behavioral therapies are probably the most commonly used therapies for depression, but they're also useful when dealing with relationship improvements, skills development, personal empowerment, behavior change, symptom relief, parent training, relationship counseling, drug and alcohol misuse, stress management, and also with child abusers.

Psychoanalytical or psychodynamic work is both directive and long-term 

00:13:10
RICHARD HILL So, psychoanalytical, psychodynamic, analytical psychologies. While the behavioral cognitive traditions have emphasized current thoughts and behavior patterns, as the best option for achieving change, the psychodynamic traditions of Freud, Jung, and the object relations people, such as Melanie Klein, focus on the importance of two things in order to understand what is happening for a client. The one, look beneath the surface of the conscious mind. Two, examining the client's early experiences in order to establish the relational template, or pattern, that the client then attempts to put into or onto most significant relationships as a way of healing. In this stream of modalities, we include the chief psychodynamic therapies, psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, analytical psychotherapy, Carl Jung, object relations psychotherapy, Melanie Klein. Now, I'll discuss psychosynthesis, which is also a psychodynamic, in the section on transpersonal therapies, it's slightly different. After much clinical observation of his patients, Freud established his psychoanalytical psychodynamic theory at the end of the 19th century. Often referred to as the talking cure, its initial method was cathartic hypnosis. Subsequent techniques included analyzing transference, free association, establishing rapport, and dream analysis, through which the therapist hopes to effect change in the client's personality. Freud was revolutionary in looking to the unconscious for repressed feelings that needed to surface. His constructs of the three main parts of the psyche, the id, the unconscious, instinctual center of the being, the ego, the arbitrator and balancer, the superego, the guardian of the conscience, imposing morality onto the process, are core psychology understandings, and all have a role in controlling client anxiety. Now, among the Freudian concepts which have maintained a high profile, not only with mental health practitioners but also in lay circles, have been those of the phases of libidinal drives. Before he ever postulated a separate drive for aggression, Freud talked about the oral, anal, and phallic phases. The oral phase, extending from birth to 18 months, centers on gratification connected with the mouth, orienting people towards taking in what is pleasurable, and expelling what is not. The main danger in the period is loss of the need satisfying object, very often, mum and her breast. The anal phase, between 18 months and 3 years, sees the main source of pleasure from retaining and passing feces. Thus, an individual comes to learn that what is valuable and to be retained, and what should be expelled. The main danger here is the loss of love from those who matter. After three years of age, the phallic phase is in progress, where the main area of libidinal gratification is around the genitals. Penis envy and sexual wishes and fantasies come into being at phallic, so the chief danger of this period is fear of punishment for forbidden sexual and aggressive wishes. Now, Jung, originally a disciple of Freud, broke away around 1913 to establish a different understanding of the unconscious. Specifically, that the mass of unconscious material that humans can access is in the collective unconscious, the universal truths and beliefs that are often seen as archetypes. This material could be accessed via interpretation of dreams, which would allow the client to see his or her problem more clearly, thus leading to healing. Because Jung believed that opposites were a precondition for psychological life, he sought to understand the opposites in a person's psyche, which could only be transcended, and wholeness experienced through increased awareness. This belief made it natural to posit the notion of psychological shadow, that hidden part of a person that balanced the ego, the part of ourselves that we're aware of, in the personal consciousness. And there was a role for the persona, or public face of an individual in society. To accept that so much material lay in unconscious realms made it imperative to recognize the importance of transference and countertransference in the psychotherapeutic relationship. Finally, Jung believed that the process of free association, when the client just spoke whatever came into their mind, needed to be a cooperative procedure, with the analyst as well as the patient making interpretations. Melanie Klein, another disciple of Freud who came to diverge from his thinking, developed what has been called object relations theory , that's not Klein's term. The object being another person with whom a child is in relationship. The theory suggests that a person's relationships, from childhood through to adult years, are shaped by family experiences during infancy. In Klein's theory objects are usually internalized images of a primary caregiver, such as mother or father, and may even be parts of a person, such as the breast of a mother, which may be termed a part object. A person's conception of objects can be reshaped by later experiences, but objects continue to exert a strong influence throughout life. In fact, the infant mother interactions are so intense that they form the focus of the infant's drives, sometimes provoking anger and frustration, and other times provoking dependence. The infant's reactions are powerful enough to overwhelm his or her individuality, says Klein, so the manner in which the conflicts are resolved is reflected in the adult's personality. Psychoanalytical or psychodynamic work is both directive and long-term. Its slow pace can mean that clients see their therapist, sometimes several times a week, for years, thus it's also expensive. Although long term commitment on behalf of both therapist and client is required, this stream of therapy is good for healing and resolving past issues. Delving deep into one's unconscious can promote self-understanding and self-awareness, empowerment, and self-actualization, and open the door to spiritual development. The proponents of humanistic therapies say that their modalities can also do the same, but without the psychoanalytical limitations. Let's look at humanistic approaches now. 

00:19:50
Humanistic/Person-oriented and Existential/Transactional Analysis 

00:19:50
Person-centered (Carl Rogers), Existential (Rollo May; Irvin Yalom), Transactional Analysis (Eric Berne) 

00:19:50
Congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathy 

00:19:55
RICHARD HILL Humanistic, person centered, existential, transactional analysis. Under the umbrella of humanistic modalities, I want to speak about person centered, Carl Rogers, existential, Rollo May and Irvin Yalom, transactional analysis, Eric Berne. What kind of a therapy might we as mental health professionals come up with if we believed that, not only do human beings all have an actualizing tendency, a tendency to move toward a realization of full potential, but also, this actualizing tendency is part of a formative tendency. Observable movement toward greater order, complexity, and interrelatedness that can be seen in stuff, crystals, microorganisms, as well as in human beings. In 1940, the answer to that question became Carl Rogers' development of person centered, also called client centered, therapy. Rather than feeling the need to direct clients in how to change their behavior or language, and rather than believing that they must dig up and process most significant material from their unconscious, the humanistic therapies began a revolution by positing that self-directed growth could and would occur if the client were able to access a particular kind of relationship, one characterized by genuineness, non judgmental caring, and empathy. So, rather than perfect their techniques, therapists who desired excellence needed to enhance their beingness. Something that they could convey congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathy. Humanistic psychologies generally assume that the paternalistic, authoritarian attitude taken by psychoanalytical therapists has a negative influence on outcomes. In person centered therapy, rather, the warm, accepting attitude of the therapist helps establish rapport, allowing the client to feel to be in control. Unlike in cognitive behavioral and psychoanalytical approaches, the therapist is non directive, and only helps the client by listening and responding in a positive way, reflecting words and feelings, prompting responses when the client falters, and clarifying. Above all, the therapist is warmly there for the client. The therapist's congruence, believed Rogers, allows the client to feel safe. If the rapport between therapist and client is essential for treatment, the passive stance of the therapist is the treatment. Because person centered therapy is mostly about being in a relationship, it's well-suited to issues of relationship improvement, skills development, self-understanding, self-awareness, and mind body awareness and integration. Such therapy is designed to nurture the client's growth, resulting in personal empowerment and fulfilment of the client's potentials. While these positive outcomes would all contribute to a person's wholeness, even Rogers believed that, as a sole treatment, person centered therapy was insufficient to allow the client to make permanent behavior change, without other, more directive therapies. It is possible that other humanistic psychology, that associated with existentialists Rollo May and Irvin Yalom, would also not, in itself, achieve change. Existentialism arose in the 1940s and 1950s, as a reaction to the then-current psychotherapies. People understood about Freudian drives, behavioral conditioning, and Jungian archetypes, but longed to know, where was the actual immediate person to whom these things were happening? Existential psychology thus developed, not as a specific technical approach with its own rules, but as a way of asking deep questions about the nature of the human being and the nature of anxiety, despair, grief, loneliness, isolation, and anomie. Distinguishing between normal and neurotic anxiety, and the existential model of personality was founded on a different way of inner conflict. It assumed that the basic conflict is not with suppressed instinctual drives or other significant adults in the person's early life. Rather, it is between the individual and the givens of existence. That is, the ultimate concerns of human beings, which it names as death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness. Confronting these constitutes the content of the individual's inner conflict from an existential frame of reference. Existentialists also believe that individuals have deep, powerful beliefs in their own specialness, that is, their personal inviolability and invulnerability, and in an ultimate rescuer. Where Freudians believed that people had drives which gave rise to anxiety and against which they formed defences, the existentialists saw that it was awareness of the ultimate concerns which gave rise to anxiety, against which defence mechanisms were created. Another modality seen as humanistic is transactional analysis, founded by Eric Berne. Seeing all people as born okay, individuals, and responsible. TA is more directive and more dynamic than Rogerian therapy. It links intrapsychic dynamics with interpersonal behaviors, within a humanistic framework. It is seen as an integrated approach, drawing from various schools of psychoanalysis, to enable an individual to effect change. TA tries to find a fix for maladaptive client behaviors, by involving the client and the therapist in a contract to change the way the client is acting. Some of the basic concepts revolve around the ego states that a client could have. The parent is holding sway when the client is controlling, bossy, nurturing. The adult is the problem solver, and the storer of information. And the child is dominating when the client is either thinking, feeling, or behaving like the child we all once were. TA clients come to recognize where their attitudes originate, and how they are productive or destructive. By bringing to awareness unconscious scripts that they may have been enacting. Clients can facilitate their own change. While the humanistic modalities have led people to the edges of their body, mind, and emotional growth, even showing the way to self actualization, they have stopped at the threshold of self realization. 

00:26:30
Transpersonal modalities 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:35
Psychosynthesis (Roberto Assagioli), Asian Psychotherapies such as yoga and meditation 

00:26:40
RICHARD HILL Transpersonal modalities. In this section we include discussion of, psychosynthesis, Roberto Assagioli, Asian psychotherapies such as yoga and meditation, from Buddha and other wise men. Just a note here, Jung may be fairly counted as a transpersonal therapist as well, but because of the analytical emphasis of this work, I prefer to talk about Jungian thought in that earlier context of psychoanalytical approaches. So, in the early 20th century, Roberto Assagioli, similar to Carl Jung and Melanie Klein, was a disciple of Freud. And like the others, Assagioli, broke away, critiquing the Freudian assumption that most, if not all, symptoms could be traced back to thwarted pleasure, libidinal impulses, and they repressed material from the unconscious. Freudian psychology, to Assagioli, did not sufficiently acknowledge the spiritual dimension, altruistic motivation, and experiences of the sublime as integral to human being. Understanding that symptoms of some clients occurred not because they were dysfunctional, but because they were seeking expression of greater wholeness, Assagioli founded psychosynthesis in 1910. It did not, however, become popular until later in the century, when the rise of humanistic psychologies would validate a focus on healthy people, as opposed to pathology, in order to understand human beings. Psychosynthesis is a psychology of self-realization, in which the basic understanding is that all people, whether they know it or not, seek to integrate, or synthesize, all parts of themselves into a whole. Thus connecting with the self, the soul, and beyond that, Assagioli claimed, self-realization allowed connection to what Jung had called the collective unconscious, or what Assagioli called the superconscious, the transpersonal. An early explorer of transpersonal psychology, Assagioli recognized spirituality as an essential foundation of psychological health and healing. Some of the signature concepts of psychosynthesis were those of the will and subpersonalities. He explained that will is the function closest to the self, that is, closer than thinking, emotion, sensation, impulse, desire, imagination, and intuition, and that it is always present somewhere with a person. Tracking a client's will, therefore, could help the therapist to understand the deeper motivations and needs of a client. Naturally, in many situations a client is conflicted, with part of their personality moving toward one goal and another part moving toward a different, often opposing, goal. To deal with this, Assagioli posited the concept of subpersonalities, or mini-selves, or parts of a person's self which constellated, in order to help a client meet needs which had been chronically unmet, or which the client was defending against having met. Synthesizing the various parts of the subpersonalities into the greater whole, thus achieving self-realization, was the goal not only of therapy, said Assagioli, but all of life. As I've noted through this talk, psychotherapies address three major levels of health and development, pathological, existential, and transpersonal. Most mental health helpers would acknowledge how Western psychologists have devised sophisticated techniques for alleviating pathology. Most Westerners, however, readily concede that merely relieving pathology does not guarantee a happy, growth-oriented life. Even without pathology, there can be loss of meaning and purpose, a sense of isolation, and or issues with freedom. For example, existentialists often regard these issues as incapable of being resolved, and suggest that we must just endure them with courage and authenticity. Transpersonal psychologists would agree that the prescription for courage and authenticity, but would also claim that whole of life issues, such as meaningfulness, or lack of clarity of purpose are helped by a transformation of one's consciousness, and sense of identity, such as can occur through meditation. Techniques such as meditation were traditionally thought of as religious, but they have come recently, through the rise in popularity of transpersonal study, to be understood for their psychological benefits.

RICHARD HILL The Asian psychotherapies, which I think we can call yoga and meditation, focus primarily on existential and transpersonal levels, rather than pathological ones. Their detailed maps of states of consciousness, developmental levels, and stages of enlightenment, go far beyond traditional Western psychological maps. When I say meditation in this context, I'm referring to a family of practices which trains attention in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control. The greater control gained is then used to cultivate specific mental qualities, such as awareness, concentration, joy, love, and compassion. The aim of such practices is to deepen insight into the nature of consciousness, and to be able to more greatly identify with optimal states of psychological well being and consciousness. And when I say yoga I mean the family of practices with the same aims as meditation. However, yogas, such as Hatha Yoga, are disciplines encompassing ethics, lifestyle, body postures, breath control, and intellectual study, in addition to meditation. Whether it's called yoga, meditation, or something else, the aim of most Asian approaches, whether they get to be called therapies or not, is the ideal of ultimate health through enlightenment or liberation, rather than mere adjustment to life situations or psychodynamic factors. The means to attaining enlightenment includes the reduction of pathogenic factors of addiction, of aversion, of ignorance. And additionally, the Asians more definitely define mental health in positive terms. One Buddhist model names seven factors leading to enlightenment. Attaining the first, mindfulness, assists the individual by helping him or her to create the observer. Known in psychosynthesis as disidentified stance, from which one can observe his own ego. The remaining six factors divide into two groups, the arousing factors of effort and energy, investigation, exploration of experience, and rapture, delight in awareness, and the calming factors of concentration, ability to maintain attention on a specific object, calm, freedom from anxiety and agitation, and equanimity, the capacity to experience stimuli without disturbance. Optimal health is said to occur when all seven factors are cultivated in a balanced manner. 

00:33:40
Summary 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
RICHARD HILL Well, to summarize. I began this whirlwind tour of the main schools of psychology by pondering on what it means to be a human being. Because the answer to that has consequences for how that human being might be helped to achieve desired change. I talked about some of the chief streams of thought in the behavioral cognitive psychologies, the psychoanalytical psychodynamic traditions, the humanistic approaches, and the transpersonal psychologies. And nowadays, there are also many emergent psychologies, such as acceptance and commitment therapy, which combine elements of several schools. We've seen how behavioral cognitive proponents understand that human beings do not tend to change their behavior until they change the thinking patterns that motivate that behavior. So, for them, a human being is an actor and a thinker. They gained popularity in reaction to the psychoanalysts who came before them, proclaiming that human beings are so because of unconscious drives, impulses, and archetypal tendencies. For psychodynamic therapists, helping people change involves making the unconscious conscious. The advocates of person centered, and other humanistic psychologies, meanwhile, understand a human being as an aggregate of ultimate concerns that affect all human beings. Thus, to heal a person, we must with congruence, authenticity, and with empathy, meet the person, accepting him unconditionally, where he is right now, in the present, with all of his attendant anxieties and neuroses. The transpersonal psychologies, finally, understand that a human being is a soul, and that, as such, he or she requires for optimal well being a set of integrative understandings and practices, some of them spiritual, that will allow him or her to move from identification with the body, and the mind, and the emotions, to connection with the superconscious self, the sublime sources of infinite potential and bliss. Which psychology is right? Which has more potential benefits and greater capacity for well being and ultimate happiness, to offer us in our role as consumers or clients? Research has shown how all approaches have both served and limited those who use them. All schools have their proponents and practitioners, and also their detractors. Perhaps the wisest conclusion we can come to is that, as human beings, in the most inclusive sense of the word, we have myriad levels of needs, and endless life lessons to absorb in the pursuit of wisdom and happiness. Thus, we may be grateful for the input of each psychology we meet along the road to fulfilment. And as practitioners working with any of the frameworks, it's just possible that the greatest gift we offer our clients is not the techniques, not even the understandings, of the framework within which we work. Indeed, eclecticism is enjoying a meteoric rise in popularity, so we increasingly need to know techniques from many schools. But rather, what may ultimately offer the greatest healing gift to our clients is our humble willingness to, as the saying goes, be the doctor who stands by while the patient heals himself, or translated to mental health helping, be the empathetically, authentically present being, who opens to genuine meeting with another being.
