Creating Caring Connections

ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I have to apologize, what… what… what you're getting in this, umm… was a three hour presentation is what I normally do in a day or day and a half, so I'm trying to, like, really, condense all of that into this. So I apologize if it's…a little too quick, but I want to cover material, but there's a lot to cover. And I, as I say, ordinarily I take about a day or day and a half.

ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, umm… other dimensions to think, at about in terms of differential diagnosis, umm… sleep patterns are one… is one to think about, anxiety, another dimension. Medications, mood stabilizers, uh… for ADHD they have generally no effect, obviously. Stimulants tend to work well, Adderall, Ritalin. Antidepressants, umm… Welbutrin can have some effects. Strattera now, of course, umm… is the preferred, umm… non-stimulant ADHD med. For bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers tend to be your first line of defense, followed by atypical antipsychotics, if behavior or aggressive behavior continues, okay. Stimulants tend not to be a good thing to use with kids with bipolar disorder and antidepressants may actually be helpful. Uh… There used to be a umm… (inaudible ) called urban legend, that if you give a child who has bipolar disorder an SSRI that could make the manic. There was a recent study, I can't quote a few, I'm sorry. But it was in one of my science magazines, very good study that found that that's really not true. It is true sometimes children will take an antidepressant and become manic, but they would've become manic anyway. So, that… So, giving them an antidepressant won't make it more likely that they'll become manic, okay. So, it used to be what we thought, but it isn't, it's been found through a control study not to be true. Complex posttraumatic stress disorder would react to the attachment disorder. RAD is the psychiatric diagnosis, CPTSQ is the clinical formulation. Generally, there is no medication to use, but… but Clonidine can sometimes be useful to reduce the hyper-vigilance and the overactive stress response system. I have someone here going, yeah, you've had experience with that, works well? 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Love it. 

00:02:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, love it, yeah. You use it with your kid too or just… so yeah, umm… Yeah, I've had a lot… what I often find is, are how parents take the pulse of their child when they're sleeping, so you get a good resting pulse rate. And if it's really elevated, then I'll refer them to a child psychiatrist I use. And in those instances I found Clonidine, which is a blood pressure medication, can work really well, it kind of soothe that over responsive stress response system. And they make them more available for treatment. So again, just something to, kind of think about. What happens if you don't treat children with, umm… reactive attachment disorder or CPTST, umm… personality disorders? Umm… You can't give a child the personality disorder, if they're under 18, why? Because one of the… If you open up your DSM-4 and look down the diagnostic criteria, you've to be 18 or over, okay. Although, my daughter just, uh… daughter, oldest one just wrote a chapter in a book, uh… with her advisor about, umm… personality disorders in childhood. And I think they were trying to talk about, uh… about that, issue. But these are the kinds of things that they might grow up into, Antisocial Personality Disorder, umm… Avoidant Personality Disorder, umm… The one that you've probably seen most commonly would be Borderline Personality Disorder, right. So that's, kind of, where it's gonna lead. Okay, I want to now talk a little bit about, umm… treatment or rather the evaluation and, umm… records. And then I want to show some tapes. These are all the kinds of records I'd encourage you to look at. School, protective service. Obviously past treatment records, right. Police report, okay. Umm… In the Parent Session, and I'm gonna go through this, then I'm gonna pause to show you what I do with kids and then we'll, kind of, then talk some more or I'm gonna show some tapes. In the Parent Session, I want to talk with them about the child's current functioning. I always begin by, always just by saying, tell… tell me what brings you here? Okay. Because I want them to talk about what's on their mind, why? Well, several reasons. First of all, I'd like them to get what's on their mind, off their minds, so then they can answer the questions I might have. Second of all, as I mentioned earlier, I want to assess the parents, so by asking that, kind of, general open-ended question, I get a sense of how well can they organize their experience. Can they do that in a relatively coherent manner? In terms of the AAI, Adult Attachment Interview, are they coherent, consistent, and concise? Okay. So, it's not an AAI, but I can look at, are they consistent, coherent, and concise, in… in the narrative they produce. Umm… You know, if I have specific questions, I might use a formal semi-structured interview to screen for ADHD, bipolar disorder, umm… PDD or those kinds of things. I generally won't use the questions from the adult attachment interview in a more formal, like TPR situation, where I really need to get a better handle on the… the… the psychological state and the, umm… state of mind with respect to attachment of the foster and… and… and and biological family. Sometimes I'll use the insightfulness assessment which is a wonderful approach, you videotape the parent and child in several uh… different episodes, playing competitive game and you can look at that, of course. But, then you take a two minute segment of each and play it back to show the parent. And then you ask some certain questions. And it helps you in a more formal way assess their insightfulness. Again, I don't use this routinely, but if it's a… if it's a more, umm… complex situation, if I'm gonna go to court then I will use this instruments. So, I've got some basis for talking about this… this very important issue. The parent commitment assessment, uh… uh… this is your baby set of questions, can be very useful to assess the parent's level of commitment. Again, I use this in more formal situations not… not generally. Yeah. Why their… their chronology? You know, give me a thumbnail sketch of your child from birth to today. Current symptoms, very important. You know, after they've gone through their litany of symptoms, problems, things that are concerning, I want to ask them of what everything you child does, what's the one or two things that most get under your skin? That's most irritating or most disturbing to you? I mean, you know, parents always have one or two things. Then what I want to ask them is, umm… why do you think that is? Because I want to assess their degree of insightfulness. Do they… Are they… Are they able to recognize that the reason that one thing bothers them the most, has to do with them, not the child. I think, how many of you were here when we did the, umm… the videotape presentation yesterday with Dan Hughes? A couple of you, okay, if you remember, I talked about the, umm… the… the mother who, she was very… most disturbed about her daughter, who wouldn't mind her manners and would yawn in her face. She just couldn't… She just didn't get it that you're supposed to cover your mouth. And that really, you know, yanked her chain, it really got her angry. But, it didn't seem to bother her quite the same way that her son threw things, broke things, would throw things at her, broke furniture, would go on rampages, that wasn't really upsetting to her. And so, you know, she was able to say that, you know, I never thought about that, that's a good question, I have to think about it, that's great, that's really what I'm looking for, that willingness to consider that something's going on there and, umm… might have to do with, you know, her, not necessarily the child per say. What have they tried or worked, but didn't work. Right. And so, what I'm looking for again is their ability to, umm… engage in the inter-subjective sharing of experience, commitment, insightfulness, broadly speaking in this interview about their child. I'm assessing all of these things are ability to implement healing plays, you know, be playful, loving, accepting, curious, and have empathy, okay. Umm… Interview with the child. Uh… let me do this, I will talk about these points in a minute, but, umm… I've been talking, and talking, and talking, so what I want to do is show an 11 minute clip of a, umm… interview with, umm… a girl who spent 10 years in a Romanian orphanage, six months in a family in Romania and then was adopted by, umm… she and her cousin who became her sister. Uh… Two parents, both had a mass… father died within a year of her being adopted and, umm… Marinella was violent, beat up her mother, ran away. Oh, I want to make very clear, you know Kevin(ph), how many of you were at the luncheon today? Good, I want to make this very clear. Umm… Marinella, when I'm doing the evaluation, she came to me from secured detention, okay. So, I was doing this for an organization. She has handcuffs on, I didn't put them on. When in New York, when people come out of secured detention, they keep them in handcuffs and they don't take them off. So, they're not my handcuffs, they're secured detention's handcuffs, I don't want anyone to get any ideas. Umm… So, you'll get a bit of a picture of her, umm… She talks about the orphanage, she talks about her getting angry and then I do the, umm… the umm… attachment story completion test with her. I'll talk about that a little bit later, but I'd like you to see that first. Okay, So, let's see, Marinella first. (inaudible ) living in the orphanage, how would you describe it? 

00:11:55
MARINELLA I don't know, I wasn't going to school, but I was, kind of, stupid. 

00:11:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Hmm, what do you mean? 

00:12:00
MARINELLA I don't know. I didn't know lots of stuff, because it's not really a good enough story, but I only (inaudible ), umm… I went outside there, but not really like you know the world, real world. 

00:12:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:15
MARINELLA Like, I never went to church there, or anything. 

00:12:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:15
MARINELLA Or stories or anything. At that point I was 10. 

00:12:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That must've been quite a shock when you came here and were living in a real family with a mom and a dad. 

00:12:30
MARINELLA No, you know, I just went with it. 

00:12:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Must've been different though? You know, different than orphanage, was it? 

00:12:40
MARINELLA Yeah. 

00:12:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN How… So, how was it at the beginning, living in a real family, how is that different for you than living in an orphanage? 

00:12:45
MARINELLA I don't know because I was, kind of confused because, umm… the one that I had before, I thought the same thing will happen but these ones… 

00:12:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you thought they wouldn't keep you? 

00:13:00
MARINELLA Because I left out of there and then I thought I would leave out of here too. 

00:13:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. 

00:13:05
MARINELLA So, I didn't know. 

00:13:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. So you've been, kind of, thinking all these years that, umm… your mom now would get rid of you like that other family? 

00:13:15
MARINELLA No, that was the first, like, the day I got there, but then I kind of knew it. I definitely know that would. When I first came here that's what I've… I thought it was another family to see what it's like, but then I knew it, I was ganging up, you know, with the cousin. 

00:13:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And your father died a year ago, right? 

00:13:40
MARINELLA Yup. 

00:13:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What was that like? 

00:13:45
MARINELLA I don't know, it never happened to me before and my reaction was to it, I mean, when I went to the, uh… funeral thing, I did cry a little bit. It was, kind of, new to me because I never really had no one die. I didn't really know or anything because he was sick and everything. 

00:14:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:14:05
MARINELLA Tired all the time. So, I didn't really get to know him. 

00:14:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. 

00:14:10
MARINELLA I don't think it was my fault or (inaudible ) because he was sick, so he was always tired and everything, so. 

00:14:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And your… your mom's sick too, right? 

00:14:25
MARINELLA Yeah, they both (inaudible ) but, but my dad's was really bad, so. 

00:14:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And now you're not living with her? 

00:14:35
MARINELLA No. 

00:14:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's that like for you? 

00:14:40
MARINELLA Good. 

00:14:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It's good? 

00:14:40
MARINELLA Yeah. 

00:14:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You like secure detention better than, umm… living with her? 

00:14:45
MARINELLA I don't know, and I don't feel better in home because I… I do roam alone, I know I'm just gonna end up in these places again. 

00:14:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You think so? How come? 

00:14:55
MARINELLA I just know it well. 

00:14:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN But how do you know about it? What… What makes you say that? I'm not disagreeing with you, Marinella, I just want to understand what makes you think that way. 

00:15:10
MARINELLA I don't know, it's just (inaudible ) knowing me a lot. And they don't take (inaudible ). But the weird thing is I don't know when I'm getting angry. I just keep until like something happens. 

00:15:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right, you mean you're surprised when you get the anger? 

00:15:30
MARINELLA Yeah, because when, I mean, I don't have any feelings or anything with it. I just get angry, I just get angry. 

00:15:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So you're, kind of, moving along pretty and all of a sudden you just (inaudible ). 

00:15:40
MARINELLA Yup, and I keep going on until I realize. I don't always realize, I never really know. 

00:15:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:50
MARINELLA Unless I'm doing it to someone there really. 

00:15:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is there anybody who you really like? 

00:15:50
MARINELLA Yeah. 

00:15:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Who… Who are you closest to? 

00:15:55
MARINELLA In the world? 

00:15:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:15:55
MARINELLA My aunt. 

00:16:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Your aunt. 

00:16:00
MARINELLA My mom's mom, uh… sister. 

00:16:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Your mother's sister? Ah! Good. 

00:16:05
MARINELLA Yeah, her name is Jackie. 

00:16:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. And anybody else? Or is that it? 

00:16:10
MARINELLA That's it. 

00:16:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's it. Umm… What I like to do… is, umm… I'm gonna tell you the beginning of a story and then I would like you to make up the rest of the story, okay? Do… Do you know what I mean? 

00:16:30
MARINELLA I'm not really good at that. 

00:16:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's okay, you can do your best. I'm gonna… I'm gonna tell you the beginning of it and then you just finish the story. You tell me what happens… 

00:16:35
MARINELLA Is this from your book? 

00:16:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is it… umm… no, it's just, umm… I'm gonna give you the beginning of a story. You know, you don't know these stories. 

00:16:45
MARINELLA Oh. 

00:16:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And you don't have to… you don't have to remember anything, you have to make it up. 

00:16:50
MARINELLA The end? 

00:16:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I'm gonna tell you the beginning and you tell me what happens and what are they doing and what do they feel and you tell me what happens next, okay? Well, here's the first one, are you ready? 

00:17:00
MARINELLA Uh-huh. 

00:17:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You ready? 

00:17:00
MARINELLA Uh-huh. 

00:17:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. Well the family are seated at the dinner table, the younger child accidentally spills juice on the floor and the mother goes, Huh! About it. Finish the story. So, I mean, I'll talk a little bit more about this, but you can, kind of, imagine what anyone of, sort of, maybe your own kids how they would answer that, kids you've raised from birth. In… In all of these stories, what you would expect from a child who has a relatively healthy and secure state of mind with respect to attachment is, they're represented with the problem, okay, some kind of problem, there's a solution that involves the parent, so the parent's are responsive and engaged and helpful and then life goes back to normal, okay. So, when I ask this to my daughter, she's 12 or she was probably about 10 when I did this. Her story was, you know, umm… mom got up from the table, she went into the kitchen, got some paper towels, they cleaned it up, who's they? Oh, the… the child and… and the mom, they cleaned it up and then they sat back down and mom poured her more juice, okay. Problem, solve it together, life goes back to normal. Okay, so with that in mind listen to each of Marinella's answers to the five story stems. 

00:18:30
MARINELLA Umm… Umm… May be the mom was shocked, beating the kid. Well, I think, the mother would… wouldn't take it really defensive because it's an accident and… 

00:18:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN But tell me what happens. Make up a story about it. 

00:18:50
MARINELLA Oh, his mom probably expect her to wipe it up… wipe the juice off the table. And sit down or just go and, uh… get another cup of juice and be careful. 

00:19:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then what happens? 

00:19:15
MARINELLA May be they just keep eating. 

00:19:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, ready to for the next one? 

00:19:20
MARINELLA Sure. 

00:19:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN While the family is taking a walk in the park, the younger child climbs a rock, falls off, hurts a knee, and cries. Tell me the rest of the story. 

00:19:35
MARINELLA Umm… The mom tells the kid, okay, and next time don't do it, if she know it's gonna hurt you and just be careful of what you do. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is that it? 

00:20:05
MARINELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:20:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, in… in that story, right. The parent isn't real… I mean, I wouldn't criticize, it wouldn't be the first thing I would say. I might be annoyed that he did something I didn't ask them to do, but… right, what you hear is the parent in the story with the kid is critical and the problem doesn't get solved, the child has a hurt knee, nothing got fixed, okay. Here's the next one. The next one? 

00:20:35
MARINELLA Sure. 

00:20:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN After the child is sent upstairs to go to bed, the child cries out after hearing a strange sound. 

00:20:45
MARINELLA Umm… The mom comes upstairs, what (inaudible ) and maybe talk to the kid to see what's wrong. And then, the kid tells, well, what's wrong and then the mom tell him that's okay, that happens. And can go to sleep because it's too late. I mean, that's it. 

00:21:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, ready for the next one? 

00:21:15
MARINELLA Yeah. 

00:21:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The parents leave for a weekend trip with grandmother remaining behind to look after the two children. 

00:21:25
MARINELLA Umm… I think the grandmother will call the parents, umm… to tell them how the kids are. And the mom and dad will probably just enjoy themselves and talk to kids, say hi, and to be good. 

00:21:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then what, then what happens? 

00:21:55
MARINELLA Maybe they come back from the trip and they hear they were good. Then their mom go and get them something good. 

00:22:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Grandmother looks out of the window on Monday morning and tells the children their parents are coming back. 

00:22:15
MARINELLA Umm… Well, morning, right? Did you say Sunday? 

00:22:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Monday morning. 

00:22:25
MARINELLA Oh, Monday. Well, the grandmother would get them ready for school, then the kids would come back from school and would be really surprised when they see their parents. 

00:22:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then what? 

00:22:40
MARINELLA And then they'll just have… then they would just… I don't know, just be, in fact, happy that they're home. Then tell them how they did at school and all. 

00:23:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Great, great umm… Do you have a best friend Marinella? 

00:23:10
MARINELLA No. 

00:23:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No? Do you have, umm… any friends, anyone who you really think of as a friend, someone you can confide in or… 

00:23:15
MARINELLA No. 

00:23:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no friends? Did you ever have any? 

00:23:20
MARINELLA I… I don't really want any friend because I don't want, really, lots of people in my life. 

00:23:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And… And why's that? 

00:23:30
MARINELLA Because it's, I mean, sometimes they'll try to help you, but you take it the wrong way and I don't want to hurt other people anymore. 

00:23:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you think you… you think you always hurt people? 

00:23:45
MARINELLA Well, when they try to help me I don't like and I then just do I… happens all the time. 

00:23:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Why do you think that is? 

00:23:55
MARINELLA I don't know, because I think they're like being none of their business, but they're not really. They're just trying to look out for me. But also friends, I don't know, because if they do like jokes and stuff and I would say no definitely. But I don't really… they would probably not want to be friends with me anymore and I don't want, like, to do something mad that they would know it, so. 

00:24:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What about other people, who don't do that? Why wouldn't you want to be friends with them? 

00:24:30
MARINELLA Well, but they have other friends that were doing it. Well, anything bad like that and they want me to do it or join something that… 

00:24:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, what… So, what about being friends with, uh… other kids who don't do that? 

00:24:45
MARINELLA No. 

00:24:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No? How come? 

00:24:50
MARINELLA Because I don't really have time for all. Because I got school and then just I'm home and everything. Time goes too fast. 

00:25:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. Oh, uh… questions, why was she in, uh… secured detention? Umm… well, she would beat up her mother who… who had M… has MS. Umm… I mean, I think they could beat up people who don't have MS, but, you know, uh… she would beat her up and run away and so she just had run away enough that, umm… in New York, they put her on what's called a PINS petition, Person In Need of Supervision. And so, they picked her up after she ran away and then wound up in secured detention because she's a runner. Okay, I'll… Maybe I'll just answer a couple of question about Marinella, and then, kind of, go through the clinical part of what I do with children. If… If there are questions about her? 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN Can you talk a little bit about (inaudible ), the way she is (inaudible ). 

00:25:51
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, oh, sure, yeah, the… from the attachment story completion test. Uh… Well, couple of things, first of all, it was disorganized in the sense that you could see a lot of different patterns. Umm… The other feature, it's rather subtle, but if you listen to the entire… all of the stories carefully, they have a quality of, umm… as if she's trying to describe something that she just doesn't really know about, you know, it's… it's more cognitive. Like, in the last one, especially, you know, children would go to school, this would happen. She, sort of, you know, trying to describe a story whereas, you know, if you think about your own kids again, my daughter, they… their story would've something about the kids would be happy, they'd run outside, they'd all hug each other, right. None of that. Umm… In her stories, adults were present, but, kind of, I describe as benignly inapt. She was never a victim of abuse, the… the orphanage staff, they were not abusive, they just weren't available, so that's her experience of adults. Umm… Kids are much more important than… than adults. Yes? 

00:27:15
(inaudible) 

00:27:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The… The question was, umm… she's seeing different versions, uh… using story stems, they're have a lot more detail, maybe or more animated, so what about this. The… The words I'm using are… are from… if you… on your handout if you look at, uh… Do I have it up here? I think I do. Umm… Ah, the attachment story completion test. If you download those two articles that I reference there, umm… those are the words they use. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN It doesn't say the (inaudible ) by someone else. 

00:27:51
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, so, question was that they're…they're… they're… other story stems have different, uh… storylines to them, that's through the lots. If you get the book, the MacArthur Story Stem Battery, there are probably hundreds of story stems, but I like this one… set of scenarios because generally it follows the, umm… string situation protocol, right, with separations and reunions, each story gets progressively more evocative of attachment behavior, right, accident, hurt, right, scared, separation, reunion and, umm… there's some good, uh… good research on it, so that's basically why. Yeah, yes. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN But what was the other (inaudible )? 

00:28:37
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good question. So what does it tell you? It was designed as a research instrument to help you classify a child's state of mind, with respect to attachment, using those research categories of secure, umm… anxious… the… the anxious which would be the ambivalent or avoidant or insecure, rather, anxious or avoidant and man disorganized. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) avoidance would mean? I mean, I don't want friends, I don't need them. 

00:29:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, in that case, yeah, what I was like, that wasn't the attachment story, 'cause I was just us, chatting about friends. And the way I would interpret that along with her stories is this is a child who has no experience with relationships, so why would she want friends? She doesn't know what friends are? She has no clue about them. How could she answer stories about reunions if she's never had separations from people who are important to her and reconnection. So, much of what was going on with her is an absence of experience with relationships. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). So, it gives you the attachment security whether it's a secure one (inaudible ) doesn't necessarily assist with assessing where, you know, Reactive Attachment Disorder more attachment security (inaudible ). 

00:29:57
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The… The question was so it doesn't really tell you if the child has Reactive Attachment Disorder, correct. There is no instrument I know of, there is no instrument, period, I'll just say, that you can use to diagnose Reactive Attachment Disorder, it's a uh… it's something that you need to do through clinical judgment and that's why I want to use a variety of pathways, this is one of them. Clinical interviews and other, some of the other tests, getting the history and that's why I said earlier, when you then get a variety of instruments or modalities pointing in the same direction, then you can have more confidence in your uh… uh… diagnostic opinion. There a question? 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:30:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. Good comment, but she didn't really seem to have much concept or awareness of relationships. The other thing that stood out for me at the very beginning, remember, she was, kind of, getting a little stuck on the stories and then when she's told her first story, she was describing more, uh… like the parent and describing things and I said, "No, make up a story." She had no experience with parents making up stories. She… She actually doesn't know very well, what… what is a story, yeah. One more question and I'd like to move on. Yes, back there. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:31:21
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Question was, were they capable… the family… of uh… really integrating her into their family and making her a part of that and, umm… I'd say, in the first two years, no way after treatment, yes. She went into residential treatment over the course of the year, we did treatment wash within residential treatment. And then when she came back home, she was in a very different state, psychologically and emotionally, as was her mother who had then a whole year of working through other issues. So, uh… in fact, it wound up being a reasonably, umm… you know, a good placement at that point. Okay. So, let me talk a bit about, umm… again, with the child, umm… I'm doing a bit of a diagnostic interview, little bit of mental status, you know, often ask kids what grade you are in? What's your birthday? Do you know your birthday? Do you know your phone number? Your address? One of the things I always like to ask kids and you'll see it on one of the clips I'm gonna show, which is my right hand? And I can't tell you how many kids, you'll see that the girl, she's 13, right. Which is your right hand? She points to this one. I'm writing, and then she says, "You are writing with your right hand?" I say, "Yes." She goes, "Oops!" Okay, umm… But just that, you know, that simple ability to change perspective, many of these kids lack. Uh… So that falls under mental status. Umm… (inaudible ) the house treat person drawing to organize my interview with the child. Many of the children I see, may not be true for you, so this may be less important. Many of the children I see have had three, four, five assessments. They've been through treatment, gobs of times. They know more about assessments than I do. So they're, you know, they're prepared for the questions, you know, they know what to answer. So, I like the house tree(ph) person because it's unstructured. There's no right or wrong answer. How did they handle that? You know, lot of kids, like you to draw, umm… a house. Well, what kind of house? Who's house? Whatever house you like. So, I… I find that very helpful. it also begins to relax kids once they see, oh, they can draw whatever they want. I ask questions about it, it's all okay then as we move into other areas, they… they are a little bit more relaxed, so that's very helpful. Umm… This is something I've developed that I find helpful. I ask children first the… the… the primary colors with crayons on the table, okay. With the house tree(ph) person, usually I have somebody do it in pencil, then you have them do it again in color with crayons. And the idea is color evokes emotion, so you can look at their ability to regulate their emotions comparing the black and white with the color, okay. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Do it at the same time? 

00:34:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, yeah, I do the… I do the pencil then I pull out the crayons, but I don't want to do it right away. So, then what I do is when the crayons are out, I then move onto this, while I say what color would you pick for mad? And they pick a color. I have them write it at the bottom of the page. "Sad", "Glad", "Scared". Then I say, "Draw a big heart on your page, any color." They do that. And now I say, "Fill it in with the amount of each feeling you usually feel most of the time." You know the proportion of each one. And I can't tell you how many kids, even who are very defensive, give me what seems like really accurate pictures of that. Gobs and gobs of "sad" or "mad" or "scared", you know, not a lot of "glad." And then at that point, then I move to, "Okay." I go back to, "Draw me a house, tree, person with the… with the crayons." Go ahead. You got a quick question? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Did you say what age children do you use the House-tree person do the heart drawing? 

00:35:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, yeah. Uh, the question is, "What age do I use the House-tree person heart drawing?" From about, may be three or four, up to 19, 20. Yeah. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN How long (inaudible ) generally you are (inaudible )? 

00:35:31
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Clinical interview with a child? About an hour, about an hour, can go a little longer, sometimes it's shorter, depends how… how gabby they are. Umm… Four key questions, again, this is just something I found really helpful. Four questions, umm… It's… It's on the slides, you'll see it, but I like to ask, umm… first ask, you know what the word proud means? And most of the kids say, "Yes." Then I ask them to tell me what it means and then I explain it to them because they really don't know. But I say, "What's the one thing you've done in your life that you are proud about?" And it gets… it… it… it winds up for me being really sad because so many of these kids were saying "nothing." They can't think of anything or they might say, "Oh, last week I got an 80 on a spelling test." And I think that's really, really sad that they don't feel there's anything they've done that they are proud about. I ask my 12-year-old, "Samantha, what have you done in your life you are proud about?" She'd, kind of, rattle on and on all the different kinds of things she's happy about that she's done. Then I ask, "What's the worst thing you've ever done?" Okay. And that's, sort of, a reality check because I've asked… I know from the parents already and it lets me then say, "Oh, so the worst thing you ever did is you got a C on a test, is that worse than when you, umm… you know, broke your mother's nose? Okay. I have had one boy who described, umm… just sort of what with him it was, he broke a lamp and it was worse than when he broke his mother's nose, because I asked him, "Oh, what makes it worse?" It was worse because the lamp was broken, it couldn't be fixed, but his mother's nose healed. Okay. So I mean… I mean, you might not agree with his rationale, but… but he certainly had a reason that had internal consistency in his world, in his view, I could, you know, that made sense, so it wasn't not, you know, a psychotic answer. And then I do the umm… the Attachment Story Completion Test. Umm… okay, I've discussed this. I discussed the critical, the four questions I'd like to ask. Oh, yeah. Then, what's the best thing that ever happened to you and what's the worst thing that ever happened to you? Now I also like this pairing because the first two questions have to do with you as the actor, the second two have to do with, sort of, you as object or a recipient and again a lot of children I see have trouble with this. What happened to me versus what did I do? They really have to… they get confused about that actor versus object piece. And that's really important if you begin to think about cognitive processing, and where they are. Remember PRJ? Remember that? From psyche 101? Let's you know where they are, cognitively, in terms of cognitive development, okay, which has important implications for school. You wouldn't put a kid who is a concrete operations in geometry where they've got do to geometric proofs, right. They might be smart, but they don't have the cognitive capacity to think in that kind of way. Okay, I talked about the attachment story completion tests, so these are the questions… Umm… I talked about this. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:39:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The ca… Oh, Child Apperception Test? I sometimes use that. It's… All that it is, is the series of pencil drawings that you show children and they make up stories about them. So again, I… I like it because it gets underneath the defensiveness that some kids have. They make up a story and… and the pictures are filthy. Some are filthy benign, some not, but it… it helps you get a sense of what's going on inside of them. If I'm going to do that, I've got to add about another 20 minutes to the time, 'cause it takes a good 15-20 minutes, depending on how verbose the child is to, to do that piece. Umm… Okay, uh… time… Before I go on to talk about the caregiver meeting, I want to show you another clip, but before I do that, any questions? The… The clips I'm gonna show you are, umm… what are they? Uh… Well, I don't fully remember, but they seem like a really good idea when I put the… the things here, they are only a few minutes long, so it'll be okay, but they are relevant, I promise you. But, yes, ma'am. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:40:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Say it again? 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:40:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, umm… no. Again, I just… with my exp… my opinion is that you can't make a diagnosis of RAD from a questionnaire. It really, it's a complicated issue, umm… and it really needs to be clinical judgment based on a lot of input. And as I've described, children who… probably children who are gonna meet that diagnosis, really the clinical formulation of CPTST is much more useful because there's probably impairment in a lot of other areas, academic, you know, behavioral, emotional, etcetera. So, let me, okay, so let me show you another clip and, umm… then I want to talk about some of the tests I used, okay. Uh… The girl I'm gonna show you, she's about 12, adopted from Russia when she was about seven or eight, that's about all you need to know. And again, it's the first time I'd met her. I had met her parents, but first time, I've met her. Anna, do you know what the word 'proud' means? To be proud of something? 

00:41:35
ANNA Umm… To be happy? 

00:41:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, it's, kind of, like it, if you are proud of something, you are happy about what you did. You think it's really special and you want everybody to know. So, what would you say is the thing you've done that you are most proud of? 

00:41:50
ANNA Being good. 

00:41:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Being good, but can you be more specific? 

00:41:55
ANNA Umm… Like stay out of trouble. 

00:41:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Can you be more specific? Like what do you mean? 

00:42:00
ANNA Like, not going out or go alone. Don't… not going to Keith's(ph) room that way, what else? (inaudible ). 

00:42:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, so you've… what you've described though, these are real things you didn't do. You didn't (inaudible ), you didn't gone to someone else's room. Can you tell me something that you've done that you are proud of? Those are things you didn't do, what… what have you actually done that you are proud of? 

00:42:30
ANNA Well, you mean something bad? 

00:42:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no. What have you actually done that you are proud of? 

00:42:35
ANNA Umm… Playing with my toys. 

00:42:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You are proud of playing with your toys? 

00:42:40
ANNA Yeah. 

00:42:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What do you mean? 

00:42:40
ANNA I mean, when I'm bad, I can't play with my toys and I'm like, please, please, get away from me. I mean… I'm so proud to put my Barbies and my toys and stuffed animals. So, I'm proud of that. 

00:42:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, and what would you say Anna, is the worst thing you ever did? 

00:43:05
ANNA Lie (inaudible ). 

00:43:06
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. Okay, and what's the worst lie you ever told? 

00:43:10
ANNA Umm… well I have… like (inaudible ) all that. I mean I told that to my classmate. 

00:43:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And what was… what was… why was that bad? 

00:43:30
ANNA Because I said I swear to them, I did. And I had no guitars. 

00:43:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, but what's so bad about saying to your friends you have 10 guitars and 10 (inaudible ). 

00:43:41
ANNA Because I don't. 

00:43:41
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, well, I didn't… I know you don't but what… what's so bad about telling them that you do when you don't? 

00:43:45
ANNA Because then they're gonna make fun of me and not talk to then much. 

00:43:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, and what's so bad about that? 

00:43:55
ANNA Because then I'm not gonna make a lot of friends. 

00:44:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. What would you say Anna is the best… Thank you. What would you say is the best thing that ever happened to you? Not that you did, but the best thing that happened to you? 

00:44:20
ANNA You need something bad or good? 

00:44:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Best. 

00:44:20
ANNA Umm… I got a new sheet for my bed. 

00:44:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:44:25
ANNA And I'm gonna look at my room, throwing all paper on it, so. 

00:44:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And what would you say, Anna, is the worst thing that ever happened to you? 

00:44:35
ANNA Picking up dog poop. 

00:44:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, that's what you did. But what's the worst thing that happened to you? 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:50
ANNA Stealing? 

00:44:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's what you did. It didn't happen to you. You stole. 

00:44:55
ANNA I don't know, uh… nothing. 

00:44:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. Okay. Now why did you have to pick the dog poop? 

00:45:00
ANNA Because it was a punishment. 

00:45:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, I see. 

00:45:05
ANNA You know, I had to pick leaves, pick dog poop, like other stuff that were there. 

00:45:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And… And why did you have to do that? What… What happened that you got punished? 

00:45:10
ANNA For lying and not doing what my mom (inaudible ). 

00:45:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, I see. Umm… Which is my left hand? 

00:45:20
ANNA That one. 

00:45:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That one, okay. 

00:45:25
ANNA My left, my right, so this one, this one. I get confused. All my friends all right, this one, this (inaudible ). This is your left, this is your right. No. My left. Very confusing. You are writing with your left hand, aren't you? 

00:45:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I writing with my right hand. 

00:45:45
ANNA All right. Oops, I made a small mistake. I can't tell. As you know it's your right and it's your left and I was thinking everything is the same. 

00:46:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN All right. Okay. The question is what was her, what is her or was her IQ level? Umm… I don't really remember exactly except it wasn't particularly problematic. But, what you are hearing, I think we're… I think what you were responding to is just her accent. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Well, I'm just trying to figure out how much of (inaudible ) is going on here and probably how smart she is, but other process is happening. 

00:46:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you mean the right and left thing? 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, and it isn't just the confusion that she is talking about like what you mentioned, like what… what she did, what was done with her and that, I mean, just that, is that you know part of this (inaudible ) 

00:46:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, that… with her what you were saying in… in those elements, it really was more neurologically related. She didn't have a, like, a real low IQ. I don't remember, I would have remembered if it was really low. But no, I think it was just more… the… the effects of having been neglected. Umm… If we have time, the boy I'm gonna show is clearly, has clear neurological impairments and you see that, very obviously. Umm… But before I do that, before I show you that, I do want to talk about some of the tests and measures that I used, so that you are familiar with those, get a sense of why I use the ones I do. And then if there's time, I'll show these… these other tapes because I don't want to… I don't want to leave this part out. Umm… Child behavior checklist, commonly called the umm… Achenbach. I always use that, I always use the parent and the teacher version. I like it because there is a parent and teacher version which lets you compare the child's behavior in two domains, so that's helpful. Umm… I don't really use that one particularly, I mean, these are real special, specialty ones. Trauma Symptom Checklist for young children, I use that all the time, if the child's in the right age range which is, I think, it's four to 12, I think that's right. But I use that all the time. Umm… Very, very helpful. The Trauma Symptom Checklist, which is something children fill out. I don't use because what I found was, children would fill it out and everything was normal. And if I gave it later in treatment, they'd be really disturbed because at that point, they had act… you know, they were more emotionally available, and more responding to that. So, it just… I just didn't find it a good useful instrument in terms of doing an assessment. Umm… Sensory-integration screener. If you go to my website, there's a checklist there that I developed with a umm… OT, the person's whose stuff I gave out. That's sensory-integration. I find that very helpful. Umm… I had parents fill it out. If a child, if the parent checks off, you know, like about five items in that, then I would refer them to an OT, Occupational therapist, who is SIPT certified, which stands for Sensory Integration Praxis Test, to be evaluated. And then if there are sensory integration issues too, get a sensory guide that they can then begin to use at home, so I always use that. Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, parent and… parent and teacher, I always use that one, very, very helpful. This one I used to screen for neuropsychological impairments. So, for example, and… and there wasn't like, the parent… There was when I need the parent-teacher to fill it out, you might get a clinically significant profile with one of them. But if I'm gonna refer for a neuropsychological evaluation by a Board certified neuropsychologist, lot of psychologists will say they do neuropsych testing, but you need a Board certified neuropsychologist. Umm… But if you only get a clinical… if you only get one of those instruments filled out, you… you still can't tell whether the impairment you are seeing is neuropsychologically based or just psychologically based. So, what I do is I get it from the parent and the teacher, if the profiles are similar and impaired, then I refer them. If they are very different, really impaired in one domain, not in other, then I'm going to figure mostly what I'm seeing a psychological and emotional in nature, not having to do with a hardwiring in the brain, okay. Umm… The Connors(ph)… Oh, oh, I did the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, I use that all the time. Great tool, helps you determine the child's developmental age in the areas of communication, daily living skills, interpersonal relationship and if they are below a certain age, finding gross motor skills, and then gives you an overall score for adaptive level of functioning. And again, I find it useful, I talked about the differences in receptive and… and expressive communication, I uh… what… what… what I also find it very helpful in treatment because once then I can look at the umm… you know, have the different scores and… and determine the child's developmental age. That is so helpful for parents to be able to say, "Yes, I know your son is 13, but developmentally, he's at this age." And I can't tell you… It's interesting if… when I ask parents… you know, I know you've come here and there are problems with your child. But what age would your child have to be for you to be thinking, "Oh, this is just normal behavior for a child "x" number of years old." They often actually peg it pretty well in that regard and then but… but somehow seeing it in, in a… in a test score and seeing the graph, umm… helps them really integrate that and then begin to treat the child whether or developmentally. You had a question, Jackie? 

00:52:15
JACKIE (inaudible ) got a new one out. Is there a difference between the old one and new one? 

00:52:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes, the question is Vineland has a new and I'm… I'm recommending the Vineland to the second edition. Umm… Is there a difference? Yeah, there is a difference. Umm… This one I think, the norms are broader, umm… the norms have been updated. Umm… It's easier to administer. There is now a version to give to parents that they can take home and fill out as well as an interview version. There's also a version if you want that you can use with teachers. So, umm… yeah, if you are gonna get it, get the… get the second edition. I wouldn't get the first edition. The Connors, I occasionally use, umm… Hyper developmental history form, I may use sometimes. I mentioned the Child Apperception Test that I may or may not use. I always use the Attachment Story Completion test, Umm… again depending on the situation, I may or may not use some of the these. Yeah, at a strange situation, I'd only use with the younger child, you know, like… like an infant or toddler, obviously. Umm… If I'm going to be doing questionnaires with adults, I pretty much always now use the parents' stress index. I like that. Helps me understand where the parents are. Umm… I do have all of the parents who come in, fill out the biography for me, many of the questions of my biography, mirror the adult attachment interview questions. Again it's written. But I… I just want to get a sense of their background and… and… and their answers to some of these. Yeah, I won't go through this, but the adult attachment interview is very helpful. If you want to know more about it, read chapter 19 by Erik Hesse in the book umm… "The Handbook of Attachment," edited by Jude Cassidy and Phillip Shaver, 1999, Guilford Press, okay. Okay, umm… How are we doing… Oh, good, we are doing really nicely on time. Umm… Very briefly, in the last meeting with the parents, the third meeting, I go over anything that I might have missed or and have more questions about, but the primary purpose of that meeting is to go over the results of the assessment, whatever diagnosis I've come up with or diagnosis or clinical formulations. I talk with them about other assessments I might want them to get, umm… sensory degradation, what have you. And then I talk about my treatment recommendations and what's involved in treatment umm… and then we decide whether or not we are gonna go further. So, at this point umm… why don't I umm… pause for questions and then answer those and then depending on time, we can look at one or maybe more, uh… clips of umm… another child. Questions, at this point about anything I've covered? Yes. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN When you are close to the discharging clients. Do you do any post testing? 

00:55:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good question. When I'm close to discharging clients, do I do any post testing? Umm… No, generally not. When I do that, what I prefer to do is wait about a year. Like, that's how I got the data to do my first follow-up study, umm… a couple of years ago, it was by collecting. I had a student who could do it, but collected a whole bunch of that. But, I'd rather wait a little while, umm… to see uh… what, you know, on-going positive effects there are for treatment. 'Cause when why are we ending treatment? We are ending treatment because the family is happy, pretty much with the way things are, and they've made enough progress and what's ready… we think we are ready to end. So I, kind of, know how the results are gonna be. I'm more interested in, you know, a year later, are things still going well? It's your longevity to the… to the treatment. Yes. 

00:56:25
(inaudible) 

00:56:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, good question. The Question, she is intrigued by the (inaudible wants to know, do I give them the feelings? Umm… Yes. So at first, I… again, I put the crayons out there, just the primary colors. 'Cause I don't want them to get confused, and I want to get confused. So, I put the primary colors out there and I say, "What color would you pick for the feeling 'Mad'?" They pick one, write it down over here, put the crayon over here, if they are right handed or over here if they are left handed. I got that right. Then, umm… "Sad," "Scared," and "Glad." So "Mad," Sad," "Glad," and "Scared." Then after they've done that, I say, "Okay, umm… now what I'd like you to do on your page, the paper's here." I say, "Now what I'd like you to do is umm… over…" 'cause I've written it down here, "Mad," "Sad," "Glad" and "Scared." Now I'd say, "Over here, draw a picture of a big heart place." And they do that. And then I say, "Fill it in with the amount of each feeling you usually have most of the time." And depending on the age, I may say, "Fill it in with the proportion." I may explain it more or less, and then I have them go ahead. What I… What I… What I have found which… I'm not sure what to make of it, but umm… rarely do I find children who have complex PTSD picking your standard stereotype colors. Red for mad, blue for sad. Umm… I don't know what you'd pick for scared, maybe grey, perhaps? I'm telling you more about myself and then you might want to. Umm… and glad, yellow. Those would be probably stereo… it's… ones that my daughter would pick. Very rarely do I find these kids picking those colors. Umm… I guess if I had to guess, I… I'd have say, it has to do with their own difficulty identifying and really understanding these feelings, I guess. Ah, there's a question here then I'll take yours. Uh… Someone over here had one? No? Good. Okay, yeah, go ahead. 

00:58:40
(inaudible) 

00:58:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN How old are… Uh, she… her question is that she thinks this might be too hard for the kids she sees. How old are those children? 

00:59:00
UNKNOWN Just three to five. 

00:59:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Three to five? I haven't had trouble, uh, she said, three to five, I haven't had trouble with three to five-year-olds filling that out. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:59:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah, whatever it says, you know, pick your colors, you know, "Mad," "Sad," "Glad," "Scared." They do that. Draw a big heart, good. Now, if this… what I might say to (inaudible ). If this is your heart, you know the heart that feels feelings, you know that heart, what I'd like you to do is see that the… the… the colors and the feelings, color your heart in with how much of each feeling is inside of you most of the time. And so, then when I pick one, I'll say, "Well, what feeling is that"? 'Cause I want to make sure they know what they are doing, you know. They say, "Oh, that's mad." "Okay, so fill in the heart with how much mad is inside of you most of the time." And then they'll do that and I'll pick up. "What feeling is that?" "Oh, that's scared." "Okay, how much "scared"… put how much "Scared" is inside of you." Yes, I find they can… they can pretty much do that. Other? Ah, yes. 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) here. 

01:00:01
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. 

01:00:01
UNKNOWN There are three primary colors and four feelings. 

01:00:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Let me… Okay. Let me be more explicit, I'm sorry. What I think of is, yeah, okay. You must have been an art major or something. I'm not a… Okay, yeah. I apologize, my mistake. What I mean is, I put out typically black, brown, red, yellow, green, orange, did I say yellow? Yellow, blue and purple. So, they are not prim… they are really the colors you buy the basic box, the cheapest box of Crayola crayons, I take the white out because it's not visible, umm… but yes, those… those comes in the Crayola basic box. I apologize. Other, uh… Yes. 

01:00:55
(inaudible) 

01:01:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, question is that ever use some of the art therapy, uh, stuff on that, draw a bridge, that kind of thing. Did I not like it? Why didn't, if I, you know, if so, why not? No, I never did. One of my colleagues, one of my partners is a, umm… you know, registered or certified, whatever that is, art therapist. And she does a lot of stuff like that, I just don't because it's not my background, so. Okay. Other questions? All right, uh… quick decision point. Umm… I think I know the answer, but just to make sure, I can either show you, umm… the two more clips of that boy or I can rattle on about other stuff related to assessments. What would you like? 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN The clip. 

01:01:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Clips? Clips? 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Assessments. 

01:01:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN How many want to see clips? How many want me to rattle on about other stuff about assessment, just… I'm sorry, I should, uh… I could do both. I guess I could show the clip and rattle on. Umm… Let me show the clips and then I'll talk about what's in them, as a… I use it as a jumping off point to rattle on, I'll say that. Okay. To… To… To kind of, make some points. The boy I'm gonna show… The boy who I'm gonna show you, umm… got referred to me by a school district because he was violent in the classroom, he was in, umm… it was a umm… I think a 411 class, meaning four children, one aid, one teacher. He would throw things. He would uh… beat up the teacher, the police would be called. Umm… And so they wanted to know what was going on with him and what could they do. He's eight-years-old. Very well, thank you. Now Abdul, umm… you are in second grade, right? 

01:02:55
ABDUL Yeah. 

01:03:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… Your mom told me that sometimes you have trouble at school and at home. What kind of trouble, what kind of problems do you sometimes have at school or at home? 

01:03:15
ABDUL I kick teachers. 

01:03:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. And… How come? What happens? 

01:03:25
ABDUL I get (inaudible ). 

01:03:31
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, when you try to kick them? Yeah. But what happens before you kick the teacher? How… How come you kick the teacher? Are you feeling happy, when you kick all? 

01:03:45
ABDUL No. 

01:03:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You are not feeling happy. So, what are you feeling when you kick the teacher? 

01:03:45
ABDUL Mad. 

01:03:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mad? I see. And… And what do you get mad about? 

01:03:55
ABDUL When, my students hit me. 

01:04:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. So… 

01:04:05
ABDUL And I hit them back. 

01:04:10
[sil.] 

01:04:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And what about at home? Do you ever kick or hit at home? 

01:04:20
ABDUL No. 

01:04:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No. Do you ever break things at home or throw things? 

01:04:20
ABDUL Yeah. 

01:04:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you do. And… And when does that happen? 

01:04:25
ABDUL When my sister… 

01:04:30
[sil.] 

01:04:35
ABDUL …tries to hit me. 

01:04:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then sometimes you wind up throwing things and breaking things? I see. Do you have any friends? 

01:04:50
ABDUL Well, yeah. 

01:04:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You do? Who? Who is your best friend? You have a best friend? 

01:05:05
ABDUL Yeah. Marlin 

01:05:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Who? 

01:05:10
ABDUL Marlin. 

01:05:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Marlin. Marline. And when was the last time Marlin came over to your house? Has he been at your house? When? 

01:05:30
ABDUL Maybe at Christmas. 

01:05:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN At Christmas? 

01:05:35
ABDUL Yeah. 

01:05:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. And when was the last time you went to his house? 

01:05:40
ABDUL Never. 

01:05:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. 

01:05:45
ABDUL He used to live in here(ph), but now he doesn't. 

01:05:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. 

01:05:50
ABDUL He went to his mother's house. 

01:05:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I see. Abdul, what would you say is the best thing you ever did? The thing that you are most proud about that you did? 

01:06:10
[sil.] 

01:06:15
ABDUL Buy me a bike with pegs. 

01:06:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, that's what some… that's what somebody got for you. But what's the best thing you did that you are most proud about that you feel really good about that you did? 

01:06:30
ABDUL Mm-hmm. 

01:06:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Think about it. What is the thing you feel best about you did? 

01:06:40
ABDUL That somebody buys me a bike. 

01:06:45
[sil.] 

01:06:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's the worst thing you ever did? 

01:06:55
[sil.] 

01:07:00
ABDUL That I break something. 

01:07:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, okay. What… What thing did you break that you think was the worst? 

01:07:10
ABDUL Glass. 

01:07:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Glass. What kind of glass? What happened? 

01:07:15
ABDUL Cup. 

01:07:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN A cup. Now oh, could you… could you sit up a second, please? Thank you. Now put your back against the (inaudible ) and move the table closer. Thank you. Now, umm… Was that worse than when you kicked the teacher, do you think? It was, oh, okay. And… And what made that worse than kicking the teacher? 

01:07:50
ABDUL Mm-hmm. 

01:07:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What do you think? I mean you… you think it's worse and… and it's okay. I just want to know what makes you think breaking a glass is worse than kicking the teacher? I mean, that's how do you feel, that's how do you feel. What makes it worse do you think? Guess. Go ahead and make a guess. Make up a… Make up a story about it. 

01:08:20
[sil.] 

01:08:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Go ahead, try and do that. You've done really well so far. 

01:08:30
ABDUL Mm-hmm. 

01:08:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN But which… which is worse, breaking the glass or kicking the teacher? 

01:08:35
[sil.] 

01:08:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Which do you think is worse? 

01:08:40
ABDUL The breaking the glass. 

01:08:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Breaking the glass is worse? And what makes that worse, do you think? 

01:08:45
ABDUL No. I am… I… kicking the teacher. 

01:08:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, it's kicking the teacher? What… What makes that worse, do you think? 

01:08:55
ABDUL That they called the cops. 

01:08:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, so they called the cops, that made it worse? Nice. 

01:09:05
ABDUL (inaudible ) 

01:09:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Now here's what I'd like you to do. Comments, questions, about Abdul, what… what… what was clear, you know, based on the interview, but also supported by the brief teacher and parent version is that he has a lot of cognitive impairments. And he did suffer some significant neglect as a child. Uh… And he lives still with his birth mother but… but more what's going on the emotional disregulation, the behavioral disregulation, probably has an… and turned out later, did have more to do with some real… just problems in terms of the wiring of his brain, basically, neuropsychological impairments. Umm… So, that's why I like this tape because I don't, I don't… I'm not sure that I gave him a diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder because these other issues seemed much more, umm… salient, much… explained better his behavior. And then led to a course of action in terms of the school, that was much more functional. But uh… Questions? Yes. 

01:10:25
UNKNOWN Did they stop calling the cops? 

01:10:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Did they stop… well, they… they move… the school… they should put him in another program. And… And umm… when there was better able to handle a child who was, umm… you know, behaviorally… behaviorally reactive, so yeah, it became less of an issue. 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN I… I would just like at least with attachment I always have the feeling that, you know, the kids going outside, you know, they'll call the cops, and they are going to feel like, nobody you know, they feel even less safe. 

01:10:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I, I guess, when his case, he was in the regular public school setting, where there was a 411. I just think they didn't know how to handle that situation… he's… I mean, the angle… the angle is a little funny on the camera. He… He wasn't that big a kid, umm… and with a teacher and an aid and other teachers, it just didn't seem like it ought to be something that, they'd to call the police about, so. And… And I do think that there are times if… if a parent really can't you know protect the child and themselves, that calling the police is okay because you don't want people to get hurt and you don't want to add to the child's shame by putting him into a situation where they would do more damage and then have more to feel bad about. So, of… of the two, umm… you know, rock in a hard place, I think I then opt for the police as opposed to the other. Yes. 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN Is it neuropsychological diagnosis… 

01:11:55
(inaudible) 

01:12:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, if he… the question was so if he has a more… more psychological issues than attachment issues, umm… what does that mean for treatment basically. Umm… It… What it means is you would use then different approach. A child is who is nueropsychologically impaired, you have to determine, that's why you have the neuropsych testing. What's the nature of the impairment, where is it occurring? In which functional domains and then you can design a class from an educational setting that build on the strengths and don't keep putting the kid into the pitfalls or whatever deficits they… they have. You know, generally some things if a child has real impairment in that area, lots of repetition is important, breaking things down into steps is really important. So, there are lot of educational things you can do that'll make the experience less frustrating and then be less likely to it… him being disregulated and, you know, having a temper tantrum. Yes. 

01:13:00
UNKNOWN I just want that how is that… 

01:13:05
(inaudible) 

01:13:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's good to hear. She was saying in her school there are two different areas, one for children with emotional problems, one for kids with, you know, more learning problems and they just do either set up… they… they don't… they don't call the police. They're… They have protocols and… and processes in place if they can address these issues, that's just… it's much better. It's better not only for the child, but for the teacher, 'cause they feel more confi… confident, and more comfortable. Umm… Any other questions? Yes, one more. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:13:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, not about the meaning of life, I haven't figured that out myself, but other than that, yeah, that's too broad. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:14:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Uh… Two part question. One is, umm… what are the pitfalls that clinicians commonly make in assessments? The second one is, you know, the diagnosis may be over, uh… found and what do I think about that and, umm… I would have to say that five, six years ago, most of the children I saw had the diagnosis, but it wasn't diagnosed. And the last time I did like, it was maybe six months ago. I just looked at the last, what was it, I think, it was the last 20 cases of about… that we sequentially they came in for evaluation. And I believe it was, what it came out to be basically is that, umm… 60% and they… they were referred because they said, "We believe this child has RAD." And of that 20, uh… kids… I don't remember the number exactly, but it worked out to be 60% had Reactive Attachment Disorder and 40% did not. 

01:15:05
UNKNOWN 40% were diagnosed as (inaudible ). 

01:15:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, they weren't diagnosed… somebody said we believe this child has RAD, so we're sending you to, you know, like confirm the diagnosis or doing assessment, 60% did, 40% didn't. So, I think, you know, to some extent may become the diagnosis to (inaudible ). Umm… But I do think a… a… you have to do a comprehensive assessment, so pitfalls, I think clinicians sometimes do not do a comprehensive assessment, they focus on just attachment or reactive attachment disorder and leave out mental health issues, leave out considering RAND, leave out considering neuropsychological issues, umm… all of the issues that go along with CPTST, so that's one piece. Uh, too narrow. Uh… Second, uh… mistake I think sometimes people make is because we're focused on making a diagnosis, they're focused on the DSM-5 and behaviors. Yes, this child does have this diagnosis because they've got the six required behaviors. But, as I mentioned at the beginning of the session, you can have the required behaviors, but that might be caused by… by attention problems, for example, Bipolar, ADHD, Complex post-traumatic stress disorder, a head injury, sensory integration. You treat each of those differently, okay. Yes. 

01:16:35
(inaudible) 

01:16:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Ah! Good, umm… 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:16:46
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I didn't mention that but yes, uh, Dan Hughes, umm… has a parenting profile. 

01:16:50
UNKNOWN Parenting profile of your facilitating the (inaudible ) 

01:16:56
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, and that's, uh… again useful, umm… especially when you notice big differences, you know, one rates the other as a five and they rate themselves as a two. Umm… And it's just useful in a sense of how insightful they are. You know when I get something back, it's all fives. And the child… and they have a difficult child who's been in their home for three, four years. I just don't find that credible. I don't know how you could feel that wonderful, if you've got all these difficult things going on. So, yeah, that's… that's a very, umm… that's a really useful one, I do use that all of the time, it's easy for them to fill out and then we can use it as a point of discussion. Oh, we are, umm… out of time, so I will answer questions after, if you want to come up with. Thank you all for listening, uh… all afternoon. And, umm… have a good rest of the conference. Thank you.
