00:00:00
 Welcome, okay. Uhm, I wonder there are arm wrestling. So, I get to introduced an amazing couple of-- Harville Hendrix is more than 40 years of experience as a clinical pastoral counselor, therapist, educator, clinical trainer and public speaker. He and his wife Helen LaKelly Hunt co-created Imago, Relationship Therapy which integrates behavioral sciences, deep psychology, cognitive therapy, the shout therapy, all sorts of different domains integrated together. Dr. Hendrix is the author of the New York best time seller Getting The Love You Want A Guide for Couples and Keeping The Love You Find the Personal Guide. Along with several other books by himself and his delightful wife. On the subject of intimate relationships in parenting has been publishing in over 57 language, my favorite Harville and, and Helenism that tries my own 45-year marriage, is marriage ultimately is the practice of becoming passionate friends. With that I'd like introduce to you Helen LaKelly Hunt and Harville Hendrix. 

00:01:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, thank you so much. Uhm, so I'm, ah, I'm having a feeling while I'm standing here about this crowd. Like when does, when does... 

00:01:30
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT What, what about-- what about the crowd? 

00:01:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well, one is that it's eight o'clock in the morning. And that, ah, even God knows and get up this early. So, that there's something about them so, I, I think something special. Would you-- would you like - 

00:01:40
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT You know, I, I, think you're right. I, I think you're right. 

00:01:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX - what we think about? What you as a-- as a group this morning. Yeah, all right. Shall we have a talk. You are amazing. 

00:01:50
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT You are amazing! 

00:01:55
Imago A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT COUPLES FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE RELATIONAL PARADIGM Helen LaKelly Hunt Ph.D. & Harville Hendrix Ph.D. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:02:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So would you like to practice that again? 

00:02:00
 Yeah. 

00:02:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX And look at the person next to you whoever that might be, and say to them at the top of your voice. You-- let's do it together. All right. You are amazing. 

00:02:10
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT You are amazing. 

00:02:10
 You are amazing. 

00:02:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And now point to yourself. And say, "I am amazing." I am amazing. 

00:02:20
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT I am amazing. 

00:02:20
 I am amazing. 

00:02:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And what we wanna add to that is that, that is the truth. That's the truth, that, uhm, the capacity for being amazed and to experience amazement for most of us was lost when we're very little. And we believe that, that is our nature to experience amazement and to be amazed then that we can get that back. So, we're gonna talk about, ah, a bit that a little bit today. So, - 

00:02:50
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Yeah. 

00:02:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX - I'm Harville Hendrix, shall we introduce ourselves now? 

00:02:50
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT And, and I'm Helen LaKelly Hunt, this was built to be just to Harville, uhm, and only at this meeting was I made faculty too. And so the speech - 

00:03:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Give Helen applause to get back with me at the evolution. 

00:03:05
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT - it, it really-- is really a sort of his speech but I'm gonna just do small parts of it, oh, with him. We often-- we can prepare to do it together and-- anyway thank you for enduring a little, uhm, ah, innovation as we go along. But I just wanna mention that we do workshops together and it's so interesting two weeks ago we had a 110 couples at our workshop. And they came there stressed and, uhm, and worried because they're struggling in their marriage. And Harville has the couples turn to each other in the first three minutes of their workshop and start saying that to each other. And so, one thing we're learning new about couples is it they haven't told each other often enough how amazing they are and we are amazing, and their relationships are amazing. So, that's a new frame we, we, are, are doing just put it out there. 

00:04:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX And it's interesting that sometimes the couples you know came with, ah, on the last, ah, messages of their relationship this was their last chance. Looking at each other, and yelling you're amazing. And some people have actually move beyond the impasse with that declaration to see something new. So, we thought that we would share, ah, with you your own essence, ah, that is the essence that we're all amazing. So, and let me get this, ah, thing over here. 

00:04:25
Imago A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT COUPLES FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE RELATIONAL PARADIGM Helen LaKelly Hunt Ph.D. & Harville Hendrix Ph.D. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:04:25
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT With the sense that energy follows attention. So, we're learning and couplehood to, ah, help them keep their eye on the price where they wanna go. 

00:04:35
HOW WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT COUPLES 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:04:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So, ah, we want to, ah, talk today about a new way to think about couples. And I think the first thing is to say a little bit just a minute or two about how we even started thinking about couples. And what the context of that was and that was in, ah, 1975. Uhm, I had a divorce in 1975, with my first wife and I was a professor of, ah, marriage and family therapy at the, ah, University in Dallas which a bit cognitively incongruent. And in that, ah, seminar, sem-- in, in the seminar coming up the day I got my divorce, uhm, we had a big conversation with the 20 graduates students and, oh, that's a long story but the outcome of it was that, uhm, I got really interested in marriage after my divorce it was a little bit late. Ah, to help that marriage but I got really interested in how come-- how come on divorce? And why do people get divorced? And why the couples fight? So in 1975, that was the sort of research question. 

00:05:55
I COUPLES IN HISTORY 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:05:55
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT When, ah, Harville and I were on our third date, ah, he was divorced, I was divorced. Someone told me I should meet him, I went-- we meet at party and I introduce myself and he ask me out eventually and so, we were dating and on the third date I said, "What would you like to do with your life if you could wave the magic wand?" then he said, "I'd like to write a book on why do couples fight." I want to decode the mystery and I just was wept away with that idea and as a teenager had internalized the quote of Dostoevsky's that the person who desires to see the living God never face to face, will never find God in the empty firmament of his or her mind but in human love. So, I knew Harville was onto something really big and it's been an honor to, uhm, ah, be beside him and-- so the first thing we wanna say is that couplehood has evolved throughout history. A-- actually for millions of years no one taught much about couples but recently sociologist have come in and, and, and been able to identify, uhm, ways that couplehood can be seen as having different functions throughout history. Ah, millions of years ago the couples who lived in caves the, ah, during the agrarian, uhm, during the, ah, hunter gather period. These couples, ah, they were sort of proto families, ah, proto couples who-- a sort of have safety in numbers to huddle together in family units. So, they got together for survival but with, uhm, the rise of the agrarian culture, uhm, they were, ah, the, the society began to form and marriage began to be as a part of the social structure keeping things organized and there were arranged marriages for economic, uhm, benefits of all and then with the rise democratic societies around the world there has been, "I wanna choose, I don't want my parents to tell me who to get married to. I want to choose." And so they would find out someone who would make them happy and that's a marriage that was all about me getting my needs and that and these are the couples that come to your offices, ah, in their crisis wondering why aren't they getting what they want and we are-- we think now there's a forth kind of marriage that's on cusp of evolving. And we'll talk about that later. And that's the, the marriage that is about mutual healing and wholeness. But Harville will first take us into the what happens in the, uhm, therapy office when you see the couple. 

00:08:45
II COUPLES AS CLIENTS 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:08:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, uhm, we will think this morning, ah, about couples in a new way. And the first way that most of us in the room and Helen and I have thought about couples has been couples as clients and its the couples that merged in the democratic revolutions through, ah, marriage by choice, ah, selected through the romantic process that have become our clients and those-- that's the marriage that, uhm, that we, ah, in which we see instances of and also the marriage that we think is coming to an end on that particular of marriage is coming to an end. And that a new marriage was coming into being. So, that's the first statement, the second one is the way we think about couples determines and the way we look at the couples determines how we look at them as clients that is what it is we see in them when they come to us depends on how we look at them. And I wanna briefly, ah, walk you back in time to the origins of the primary paradigm through which individuals and couples have been looked at through are in the field of, uhm, psychotherapy and couples therapy. 

00:10:05
MEDIEVAL SYNTHESIS (AKA DARK AGES) Life was organized by one idea=GOD Everyone belonged to the religion or the state All people were subjects with no self ownership and no personal freedom A -- THE AGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL To understand the "individual," we need to quickly look at the history of the western world. Starting with the end of the middle/dark ages in the 16th century THE AGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL • a series of events, starting in the 16th Century and ending in the 19th century give rise to the "construct" of THE INDIVIDUAL endowed with: • Reason • Freedom •Independence • Autonomy THE AGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL These events changed the cultural imagination about the natural world and our place in it. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:10:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And just-- so, this is a fast walk back in time to, uhm, ah, ground the individual paradigm the prism of their self through which therapy has been, ah, progress their has been-- been constructed and through which our couples have been viewed. That the, the origin of the self was actually, uhm, a historical event that, ah, came out of the break down of the medieval synthesis in which there were no of selves. All persons were subjects not selves, not persons they belong to somebody and primarily to the monarchy what ever monarchy is were which were fundamentally a mixture of circular and sacred power. That in the 16th century of what we-- what happen was a break down of that synthesis which-- in which the organization of all of life around one belief which was the belief in-- and hardly anybody doubt it of even the people who contributed to the break down of the medieval synthesis, Copernicus, Galileo, Bruno Darwin all, ah, still operated around that belief but, ah, what emerged out of the rise of the enlightenment and, ah, was this age of the individual starting in the 19th century in which a concept was born that persons were selves that they were independent autonomous they had freedom and they had independence this got them self sufficiency. The, uhm, ah, events several events, uhm, led to that construction. 

00:12:05
THESE EVENTS WERE: • Protestant Reformation ∙ Individuals could find God on their own. • The Enlightenment = Age Of Reason = Descartes ∙ Reason and philosophy challenge hegenomy of faith • The Rise Of Science ∙ Observation challenges faith ∙ Galileo ∙ Darwin ∙ Newton • Two Political Revolutions ∙ French and American revolutions ∙ Individuals challenge the hegenomy/authority of the state. • Romanticism ∙ Revolt against reason and emphasis on feelings/imagination ∙ Psychology as a science ∙ Psyche replaces the soul 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:12:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And very briefly the primary event was the protestant reformation which, in which Luther declared that everybody was free to find God in their own way, that individuals were free to find God without the facilitation of the church. The enlightenment of restored, uhm, reason to, to the mind and therefore began to be a challenge to faith. Reason and philosophy challenge the hegemony of faith. Science a, arose during the same time and with science we began to establish other challenges to faith, Galileo saying that universe was on that on the, uhm, earth is in fact not at the center of the universe but the sun is-- he was wrong of-- but he was nevertheless right about what he could observe at that time but the earth is clearly and the sun is clearly not the center of the universe. Darwin began to reframe who, who human beings were and gave them-- gave us human being so sort of instinctual animalistic character that are likely was matter of survival and adaptation Newton re-created, uhm, the relationship of individuals to the universe and establish and a sense of separateness that everything was like billiard balls that but the idea of separateness. Two political revolutions established individual freedom and authority. Romanticism was a revolt against reason in the 19th century and move to an emphasis on feelings and in that period, psychology as a science rose. 

00:13:40
DEFINITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL ∙ Free to follow his own path to God ∙ Endowed with reason ∙ Capable of observation and discovery ∙ Driven by instincts ∙ Separated from context ∙ Filled with emotion ∙ Adaptive ∙ Competitive ∙ Independent ALL INSTITUTIONS IN THE WESTERN WORLD SINCE 1600 WERE BUILT TO PERSERVE AND SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL FREUD AND THE RISE OF PSYCHOTHERAPHY FREUDIAN REVOLUTION ∙ Freud is heir to the Enlightenment and Romanticism. ∙ Transformed the cultural construct into a psychological construct. Moved from outside to the "within." ∙ The psyche has a three part structure: ∙ EGO: Man is essentially rational. ∙ ID: Man is driven by instincts, competitive ∙ SUPEREGO: Internal monitor, conscience 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:13:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, what happened all, all during all of these, ah, times is that the idea of human beings as individuals, uhm, emerged and that emergence was they were free, endowed with reason, capable of observation, driven by instinct, separated from context and isolated, full with emotion, adaptive, competitive and independent. Now, the important thing about all this is that when, uhm, the and the-- and, and the last thing I just saw is that all institutions of the Western World who were have been created to serve and support that construct. So, why is all that important? What's important is that all of that is an on-ramp to the rise of our profession which is the profession of psychotherapy. And that psychotherapy, ah, rose Freud appeared in that context of the individual. And what his contribution to the individual was that, uhm, the individual, uhm, has a-- an interiority. Nobody had ever mapped the inside of the self all of the other, ah, characteristics of the individual was descriptive of their social and economic and political status and how they function in relationships to all human, ah, systems. Freud arose in that era, ah, era of the Enlightenment and began to transform that construct into a psychological construct. He move from the outside of the self to the inside of the self. And as you know, created in architecture that the individual, ah, structure has a structure, you know, the ID, ah, superego and ego that there's an energetic force that those structures regulate all the instincts and that those our instincts are, uhm, regulated by, ah, the an internal superego which takes its cues from the external environment. 

00:16:00
FREUD'S PROBLEMATIC ∙ The problem is internal. ∙ We are driven by instincts of sex & aggression = the life force. ∙ Emotional memories are repressed ∙ Personal repression mimics cultural repression. Reason is compromised by DESIRE ∙ A diseased imagination. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:16:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So this, uhm, this the, the problematic for Freud when he came along was that these of-- we get all this stuff here, uhm, that this, ah, instincts were the human problem that is the regulation of those instincts of, of sex-- sexuality and aggression later life and death. And that you know, that we lived in a context, we live in a context in which those instincts have to be regulated, uhm, and that the regulation of the, ah, instincts of, of the need for that resulted in a, a, a repression that the instincts were held in. And, and that, that was a source of, ah, of neurotic symptoms. And so Freud then began to develop an architecture for dealing with neurotic symptoms. What's really interesting is that Freud noted that the, uhm, repression that was social, political economic and spiritual in the medieval period had now become an internal repression that the outside have become the inside and that what needed to be removed toward is just amazing how powerful the idea of oppression was. But he made one major disagreement with, uhm, with the, ah, enlightenment that, uhm, who positive that human beings are, ah, have reason that they, they have the capacity to reason and to experience reality. And instead was aware that what was-- what was the problem was that the reason or the imagination was, ah, was diseased that one had to treat-- had one had to treat the imagination. 

00:17:50
FREUD: HEALING IS KNOWING ∙ Create a safe therapeutic environment. ∙ Keep emotional distance from client. ∙ Make unconscious conscious. ∙ Repair diseased imagination by integrative insights. ∙ Restore reason to the throne of the psyche. ∙ Behavior will follow awareness. ∙ THERAPY IS EPISTEMOLOGICAL = what and how we know is what heals. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:17:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And the most of-- most life was that. Now, so therapeutically Freud had a very, uhm, a clear, ah, idea about, ah, what, what therapy was. And it's very similar to what most of us, uhm, now we think about it, that therapy has to be a safe environment. Uhm, and what, uhm, he also got clear was that he was the first and he knew and as we look back we know he was first, uhm, proponent and had the first technology to deal with human suffering, ah, that replace the technology of the church which are dealt with human suffering as, uhm, as a function of sin and therefore needed, ah, forgiveness and restitution. For Freud, i-- it was not a function, ah, but it was, ah, suffering was a function of, of the internal, ah, anxiety cause by the, ah, those instincts and the, ah, need for the ego to regulate those instincts in relation to society. And so for him the driving energy, the driving fear, and the driving energy was fear, was anxiety, was the anticipation that something might happen. And we find that, that still a very operative concept in most a psycho-therapeutic systems. It is a very central concept in Imago. Ah, but he also was a scientist so he began to look at the individual, ah, from a distance and did not wanna contaminate the experience. And the goal was to find inside the self those memories that had been repressed and bring those memories into consciousness to repair the diseased imagination by integrative insights. To-- he wanted restore reason-- he built-- the human beings were in fact reasonable but they had a diseased imagination. Wanted restore reason to the throne. And here is the place where I wanna make stop and just pause a minute and say what the basic machine, the mechanism of the psychodynamic model was and is. And here's-- here-- here is the basic thing just the title of the slide it was very interesting that, uhm,-- enlightenment the rise of science and all of the things that were the context within which the an individual as a construct arose, was in fact a period of great learning of great knowing that people were making discoveries of, of everything the new continents, of new dimensions of the soul, new aspects of thought, new aspects of the universe. So epistemology became the mechanism of the therapeutic process in other words healing was and is connected to knowing. So it's very important for, ah, one to know that which was unknown in the self. And that to bring the unknown into awareness was to create, uhm, integrity in, ah, in their self and therefore to reduced human suffering because when the known moved into, ah, the unknown move into the known that awareness of self began to relieve anxiety. So, what we know and how we know it became a part of the what was in fact that the core mechanism and has been the core mechanism of the psycho-therapeutic process. 

00:21:30
THERAPEUTIC CONVERSATION IN INDIVIDUAL PARADIGM: ∙ Monological ∙ Hierarchal ∙ Unequal ∙ Authoritative ∙ Objective B COUPLES A RELATIONAL BEINGS THE RELATIONAL IN PSYCHOLOGY: ∙ early Freud-experience vs. imagination ∙ Social/cultural psychoanalysis ∙ Interpersonal Psychiatry-Harry Stack Sullivan ∙ Self Psychology-Heinz Kohut ∙ Object Relations Theory ∙ Attachment Theory 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:21:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the therapeutic conversation during this period however, was a monological that is it was, uhm, in, in the sense of one way or as hierarchal therapist was expert which made the relationship unequal. There was authoritative and objective. And, uhm, what we wanna talk about this morning is a shift in that process in which, uhm, the focus on the self on it's autonomy independence and self-sufficiency which was so, ah, operational for and has been for 400 years so that the self became in a sense the ground of being, yourself became ontological, the self became the founding, the foundational concept. Began to shift, began to shift even in Freud there was an echo of the appearance of the relational model. And that, ah, most of you may know the story that Freud and his first client of made the judgment that the clients report of their-- of abuse by their parents was in fact real. An then later on change his view that, that report was a function of the clients, ah, desire and imagination. And if he had stayed with, uhm, a symptoms as experience dependent instead of, ah, internal. He would have become the first relational therapist in history but instead each others, ah, in that time and probably had no other basis for choosing that. Uhm, so in the 1950s, ah, Harry Stack Sullivan was the first person who began to report that, uhm the location of suffering, oh, is not so much inside and what is important was not so much what is inside people but what is outside them and Sullivan he's famous for statement that it does not matter so much what happens inside people. What matters is what happens between people. So She and then a philosopher Martin Buber introduce this concept into of, ah, psychology. Heinz Kohut was a, a, a began that conversation with the, ah, therapy as, uhm, ah, as an emphatic of vicarious introspection, object relations theory in Brit-- Britain and France and America arose we all very familiar with Attachment Theory. So that the whole landscape has been moving away from the self toward the relationship. And we wanna talk a little bit in the speech about how far that's gone. But first Helen is gonna talk a bit about, ah, some more about psychology and the other forms that she'll take. 

00:24:20
THE RELATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY: ∙ Carl Jung-collective unconscious ∙ Empathy based therapy-Rogers ∙ Women's Relational Psychoanalysis ∙ Interpersonal Neurobiology 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:24:20
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Yeah, just, just to continue about Harville is saying about the how the relational is emerging in psychology, uhm, I did my own slide, uhm, which was, uhm, the fact that I had the passion for Carl Jung. When I met Harville I was getting a masters in counseling psyche. And, and what I loved, uhm, about, ah, psychology that time, uhm, was were, were people who were working, ah, through the lens that Jung had when he challenged Freud that the unconscious is only individual. That in fact there's a collective unconscious that, uhm, unites us all, connects us all that, that, that fuels and feeds, uhm, us. And, ah, he also talk about archetypes and, ah, gravitational pulls that help that-- us determine who we are and, uhm, and so it, it was a sense that everything was interconnected. And so it was a challenge that individual paradigm, uhm, and, uhm, the writing, ah, and theory of Rogers too, ah, was so, uhm, uhm, galvanizing at the time when I was doing my studies in that Rogers was the one that pointed out the healing happens in the relationship between the client and the therapist. It's, it's about empathy, it's about unconditional positive for guard so, so instead of fixing yourself by you know, learning going to a therapist and finding out what you have to do to heal yourself go on or retreat or whether-- or get over your neurosis the healing happened in that in some dynamic that involved empathy and relational of respect. Ah, women psychology was emerging at the same time as Harville was writing and getting to get on Oprah and, uhm, I was so glad to be dialogue partner with him. But he, he really took that theory in the culture and I saw what happened when a group of women at the Stone Center at Wellesley, we're also doing something help women psychology for they were challenging. There is no such thing as a self. There's only a what they called the quote, "self in relation." And, uhm, it, it was interesting the that alpha masculine energy in Harville and these women who were really tracking the same impulse and not too many people know them. To people the Stone Center, was-- yeah, okay, so they were ear-- they are along-- they're-- they are group of therapist that are early pioneers to, ah, understanding, ah, and incorporating the, ah, relational paradigm. Interpersonal neurobiology, uhm, our brains are they, uhm, before it said anatomy is destiny. You're, you're just stuck with your brain. The point of therapy is insight, uhm, and just and at the end of his life someone said what's the goal of psychoanalysis and he said, "to resign yourself to human misery." And today neuroscientist are saying, "Oh, you know, you can change your brain and interpersonal, ah, interpersonal neurobiology says that the brain is experience dependent," we have social brains and dance, and others works move us out of the single skull theory of the brain that there's something that, uhm, uhm, we, we, we are shaped, uhm, dance phrases, getting beyond the eye. You and me to the we is the understanding of who we really are the we, uhm, and, ah, his recent comment that reflection relationship proceeds reflection. 

00:28:15
THE RELATIONAL IN PHILOSOPHY I AND THOU ∙ Martin Buber - invited the perspective on who we are. ∙ Shifting a person residing in their corpus to people in relationships. ∙ Caring for the Between RELATIONSHIP IN ETHICS Beverly Harrison & Carter Heyward The root of our desire to act for justice grows out of our longing for "RIGHT RELATIONS." -Beverly Harrison RELATIONAL-CULTURAL THEORY "It is essential that we learn to maintain our strengths through connection, by valuing and sustaining relation contexts." -Judith Jordon Toward A New Psychology Of Women - Jean Baker Miller (1987) Women's Growth In Connection - Judith Jordan (1991) THE RELATIONAL IN CULTURE: ∙ Two ways the energy showed up were ∙ The Civil Rights Movement ∙ the Women's Movement 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:28:15
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT So, here is the relational paradigm in emerging in psychology, it's also in philosophy with Buber's, uhm, I and Thou the study of, uhm, humans as, uhm, two people that constitute a between and that, that it shifts the idea of the person residing just in their corpus but two people if they move from I it to the I and Thou and to be conduits of universal love and there's an energy feel between them and it's their essence. It's, it's, uhm, the relationship is their essence not just them. Uhm, then relationship emerged in social ethics as well. A Bev Harrison, Carter Heyward, the root of our desires to act-- the root of our desire to act for justice grows out of our longing for right relations. So, uhm, more this field then began to go-- grow relational culture theory, Judith Jordan. Again, in the culture the relationality began to emerge with the rise of movement at the marginalized. And, uhm, like the civil rights movements, the women's movement it's about, uhm, something about democracy and the rights of the individual, uhm, has, has been very limited to, uhm, uhm, it resulting in, ah, there's a set that gets their rights and there is a set that doesn't. And so we need a new image, the rights of their relationship. Ah, an awareness of the other. So, the Civil Rights Movement, the women's movement and move-- women moved into relationship with each other and they wanted to create right relationships with men. 

00:30:10
MASCULINE VS. FEMININE ENERGY ∙ Pulsing out vs. Pulsing in ∙ Focus vs. Mosaic ∙ Rational holding vs. Intuitive holding ∙ Action vs. Reflection ∙ Yang vs. Ying GLORIA STEINEM - 1980's ∙ Our masculine culture is patriarchal ∙ Thus our marriage structure is patriarchal ∙ "Marriage is a dangerous place for women." PARTNERSHIP MARRIAGE From the vertical top-down model to the horizontal shared model. PATTY HOWELL -2007 In a federally-funded research project, Patty Howell documented a SEISMIC SHIFT HEALTH MARRIAGES PRODUCED Healthy Women & Girls! Whereas marriage once was a dangerous place for women - It doesn't have to be anymore! THE CHANGING PARADIGMS The relational paradigm will help insure ∙ Every voice is heard ∙ Every opinion is pre-validated 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:30:15
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT So these are the couples you begin to see in your office. Ah, I'm gonna skip this slide but just go to Gloria Steinem, said in the '70s, "Women, marriage is a dangerous place for you. Oh, there is a patriarchy." Had-- have you ever seen that show father knows best? The father doesn't necessarily know best. You know, your mothers are smart and, ah, who-- this the-- this, this, ah, individual, you know, there's head, a vertical model of marriage really had to shift for both people to thrive. So, uhm, so she helped, ah, really is-- identify one of the problems. And some of your couples still have, have that residue. And, uhm, there's a shift now to that partnership model of marriage which is only recently happened, that Gloria Steinem got married. And there was a lot of feather-off and his-- her husband was so cute, they were so cute. And, uhm, so, so something's new emerging I think that's the point that Harville and I wanna make something really new is emerging. There was federal funding for marriage, ah, about seven or eight years ago. And California got a lot of it and a woman did a study which I, I so appreciated that there was seismic shift going on. That now, the name of Patty Howell's research is healthy marriages result in healthy women and girls. If you learn how to have a-- at thriving relationship, uhm, a woman thrives, you can become empowered at home. You don't have to, uhm, leave, ah, to find your voice. Uhm, and so basically, ah, that whole relational paradigm, ah, will help ensure that every voice is heard, this is a thrilling thing to welcome into our culture, the shift into the relational paradigm every opinion is pre-validated and Harville will talk about that kind of therapy that will help make that happen.

THE CHANGING PARADIGMS ∙ Freudian Revolution: Focused on interior of individual as an isolated self. ∙ Relational Revolution focuses on the "between." ∙ Need a technology of the "between." CONNECTING HEALING WHAT CONNECTING IS NOT: ∙ Not what we feel ∙ Not our creation ∙ Not an achievement CONNECTING IS BEING ∙ Felt sense of Connection is experiencing Being CONNECTING HEALING, NOT 'WHAT' HEALS CONNECTING IS EXPERIENCING BEING ∙ From epistemology to ontology ∙ From knowing to being 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:32:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So basically, ah, which I starting with, uhm, the, the premise and the point that we wanna make is that a new way to think about couples, ah, is now of necessary. But it's also emerging out of the culture itself and that's the emergence from the interior to the transactional to the factor-- to, to the relational. So the way if you think about couples as individuals then therapy and coup-- couples therapy by the way did even started until the 1940, there was no thought about, ah, couples until the 1940s, and then variety of couples therapy has began and that's another point in itself. But the point of that was even with the rise of couples therapy the individual paradigm regulated the therapeutic perception and the therapeutic interaction so that couples were treated as individuals trying to create a relationship. And that is a function of the way we think. I think it's important for us therapist to know that, that therapeutic models we operate out off, ah, even though they may come from a genius mind like Freud and nevertheless mediated, he use mediating the cultural value. And that the cultural value are shifting. And that of-- when the-- in the '50s when, uhm, Solomon rang down and Buber rang down and all the other people began to talk about that. The shift of the definition of a couple changed. And we have in distilling all of that have come to, ah, to, to think about that therapy, uhm, is no longer fully achieve through the concept of understanding. There's no longer fully a function of the knowing process that epistemology as the, uhm, methodology of therapy that is you get to know yourself, you get to know your unconscious, you get to know your partner, you get to know your feelings. Those more than likely in my experience are essential on ramps to what really is healing and that is the through the knowing process one arrives at another place and that place is, ah, what Buber, ah, said in the I and Thou that all life is meeting, is not knowing but meeting all life is meeting and that word that most accurately describes what actually is healing is not what we know but how we are with each other and so our operative term is connecting. And we use the word connecting because that's a gerund as a dynamic word rather than connection which is a noun, which is static word. And here's what connecting is not connecting is not what we feel. I don't feel, it's not-- it's not what we do we don't create connecting. It's not something we can actually achieve, you can't achieve connecting. Our pause it-- is that we have move now to the fundamental ground away from the self as ontological, the self is being. And seeing the self as derivative of connecting, of context, the self is a contact to relationship. Dan Seigel of-- the other day which we--we were at the-- that the relationships first boost. And he showed me a new sentence he had just written. And then article that was written for the relationships for its website in which he said, "Harville, you would like this." He said, "relating comes first and reflection come second." Whereas, the history of therapy and the healing process is reflection comes first and relationship arises out of reflection. So that the paradigm shift, ah, at that, that, that what we're talking is a radical paradigm shift so that we begin to move into the between us. So one can feel connecting, you can experience connecting but you cannot, uhm, but it, it self not a feeling it is not something to be experienced. It is in fact the ground. Therefore, connecting is healing. Connecting is not what heals. Connecting is healing, this felt sense of connection is experiencing being and it is the experience of self as essence. Connecting is the experience in being self is essence. So that we moved to a new philosophical ground for therapy. And by the way all therapist have philosophical grounds whether, ah, whether in our psychological mo-- as we talk about that or not then you should talk about it more operationally. But the philosophical ground of the whole field of therapy including couples therapy is now moving, ah, to see the knowing process as a necessary on ramp to experiencing being or shifting from epistemology to ontology from knowing to being.

IV. THERAPY FOR COUPLES Therapy for the Couple's Relationship, not the 2 individuals in the relationship. FIRST TOOL: Imago Dialogue The Tool of Transformation FROM MONOLOGUE TO DIALOGUE ↓ Monologue Creates Inequality Creates Anxiety Dialogue Creates Equality Creates Connection DISCOVERY: Dialogue Is Healing, Not A Facilitation ∙ How does it heal? ∙ Regulates flow of energy and information ∙ Regulates anxiety ∙ That creates a safe environment ∙ Quality of the exchange, not the content ∙ Dialogue is Connecting ∙ Connecting is healing 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:38:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, when you shift the paradigm you begin to look at the couples in a different way then the therapeutic response to a couples changes. No longer two individuals trying to create a relationship or in a relationship which they're trying to regulate. But a relationship which is the generative source of the interior of the individuals that the relationship creates the inside rather than the inside creating, ah, the outside. So, just briefly and we don't have time of this morning to go deeply into this, I wanna share that when you move into modality of the of, vertical therapeutic process with an expert and a client to a horizontal modality. You move from epistemology to ontology, you move from knowing to being. You need a different therapeutic intervention and one of the therapeutic interventions that work that we have been experiencing for a working with after-- years is dialogue. And dialogue is a new way of talking that is one of the tools for transformation. And what we're doing here is shifting from the monological process and therapy to a biological process and that, that is, uhm, uhm, is, is, is the fundamental of therapeutic intervention is dialogue. And what we discover as we began to work with dialogue we began-- actually began in the individual paradigm of myself, ourselves we actually didn't become aware that Imago was in fact was so individualistic orientated. We talk about relationship in connection but we're still operating out of the individualistic paradigm. So dialogue for their-- at the start was a good form of improved communication. There is a, a way that couples could communicate better. About whatever it was they wanted to communicate and it was a better way to help them resolve the issues that they came to resolve because that regulated their interactions because it was a structure conversation. As we began to work more and more with this we discovered that dialogue is not an on-ramp to healing that through dialogue which is a structure which create safety that allows connection to be experienced is the healing process. That it is not an on-ramp to healing but becomes the healing itself. So how does it heal? It regulates, ah, the flow of energy and information. Fundamentally, it regulates anxiety so that the defenses are not aroused. Creates a safe environment so that, that the defenses can be relaxed. And when the defenses are relaxed, through that qualitative their change in the quality of the exchange one then began's to experience the vulnerability of being of their own experience of connecting that is the connecting awareness, ah, began to show up. So that dialogue itself becomes connecting and connecting becomes healing. 

00:41:40
IMAGO AS PURE RELATIONAL PARADIGM ∙ How we "are" with each other, rather than what we know about each other. ∙ How we talk, not what we say. ∙ Restores original connection, not original wholeness ∙ BCR an opportunity to express/experience empathy. ∙ Re-imaging is a new way of seeing. ∙ Re-romanticizing restores/deepens connection ∙ No Exit decision creates safety and sustains connection. ∙ Re-visioning creates ways to sustain experience of connecting. HEALING IS MAKING THE SPACE BETWEEN SACRED. IMAGO DIALOGUE The Foundational Tools MIRRORING ∙ "Let me see if I got that. You said... ∙ "Did I get it?" ∙ "Is there more?" VALIDATION ∙ "You make sense, and what makes sense is..." EMPATHY ∙ And I can imagine you might be feeling..." WHAT DOES IMAGO DIALOGUE DO? Imago Dialogue Regulates THOUGHTS FEELINGS ACTIONS Imago Dialogue Transforms SYMBIOSIS INTO DIFFERENTATION RELATING INTO CONNECTING 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:41:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, as a pure relational paradigm in which you strip the individual out of it, it turns out from our view that how we are with each other rather than what we know about each other is what we-- how we talk, not what we say is what heals. And that what really heals is that when connection is recovered through the dialogical process, we have recover-- the original connection that we are as beings. That we are is not original wholeness but original connection. So that all of the-- and I don't have time to unpack all these but these are di-- dialogical forms all of which create a new way of seeing, a new way of experiencing, ah, a new way of sustaining connection and a new way of visioning a relationship. Healing is making the space between sacred. So these tools we've, uhm, uhm, talked about before in the workshop and I'm not gonna spend time with them at the foundational tools of mirroring, validating and empathy. Regulate thoughts, feelings and actions in the service of safety. Breaks in symbiosis down so that differentiation occurs and make the turns relating, you can relate without being connected it transforms relating which can be defended relating interconnecting which is non-defended relating. Connecting is experiencing being. 

00:43:15
SECOND TOOL: ZERO NEGATIVITY PRECONDITION FOR SAFETY, CONNECTION, JOY SO, WHAT IS NEGATIVITY ∙ Default reactions of our brains ∙ What your partner experiences as negative ∙ A put down: mild or intense ∙ Emotional abuse ∙ Wish in disguise ∙ Emotional annihilation of your partner ∙ Abolishment of otherness ∙ Source of all relational stress ∙ All problems arise out of negativity ∙ Behind most physical illness REPLACE All Negativity with Curiosity & Appreciation 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:43:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the second tool that we have arrived at, that's a useful is-- its and it 's not a fiat thing but has the goal of them-- of the healing process is the arrival at a state of being which is a state when in which anxiety is regulated down to zero point. An that of-- means that the outcome of a successful therapeutic process is that one arrives at a state of zero negativity. And that this is the precondition for the safety that is necessary to experience oneself as connecting and that connecting is necessary for joy. So, what is negativity? Is the first is the default reaction of our brains is what your partner experiences as negative partner is negative is negative for them, it's a put down mild or intense from the aerial to murder, it's the form of emotional abuse. Negativity just a wish in disguise, it's emotional annihilation of your partner. It abolishes otherness. It's the source of all relationship stress. The source of all problems, if you think of, of a forest that ground floor is negativity. The trees are all the problems that arise out of that and that is behind most physical illnesses. So, negativity, ah, through the process needs to be eroded and replace by curiosity and appreciation. That is the shift from, ah, e-- even in the therapeutic process from the negation and negativity of the diagnostic process of the DSM-5 is that just coming up. Which is again and, and erosion of the-- of the self. All negativity replaced with curiosity. Now, Helen and I for a long time thought that what you have to do when you reduced negativity was increased positivity. We discovered that actually doesn't, ah, make all that much different and what really makes a difference is when you become curious, become interested, become, ah, an-- inquirer about your partners state. And then allow it to be and appreciate yet. 

00:45:25
FROM JUDGMENT... Wonder? To Curiosity and Wonder Energy Follows Attention ZERO NEGATIVITY ∙ The Logical Outcome Of Imago Theory ∙ The Logical Conclusion To Imago Therapy LOGICAL NEGATIVES WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT ZERO NEGATIVITY ∙ Why??? For God 's sake ∙ Impossible ∙ Unrealistic ∙ Idealistic ∙ What will I do with my feelings ∙ Now I can't deal with my issues ∙ I would rather just be forgiven ∙ What's wrong with negativity anyway? ∙ How can I stay in control without criticizing? What about constructive criticism? ∙ How do I get my needs met? ∙ Who came up with this anyway!? 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:45:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So we move from judgment to curiosity and wonder. So zero negativity in our view is a logical outcome of Imago Theory. It is the logical conclusion to Imago therapy. That a couple who has finished therapy actually can regulate and reasonably, reasonably regulate with some predictability and reliability that they are safe with their partner which is seem very simple. This is it that I am safe with you I'm no any longer to have walk around toward with my defenses up that I can feel safe. This is the logical outcome. So many, many, ah, reactions to zero negativity is why for God sake there's one person, says what? Why would one wanna be zero negative and then-- no power at all. Uhm, although person impossible anyway human beings are just are negative, it's own realistic, it's idealistic that's what will I do with my feelings now, and we say well now can have your feelings because negativity is a, is simply putting the other person down. Now, I can't deal with any of my issues I have to be nice all the time. I would-- one, one person so I'd rather just be forgiven just he insist-- and say negative in practice forgiveness. What's wrong with negativity anyway? What's wrong with that? Isn't that did not a good thing or you have to make judgment and you know and make difference between right and wrong. How do I stay in control if I'm not a critic, ah, what, what about in Helen one of Helen's script. There is one of the constructive criticism, you know, can you do constructive criticism? Tells about they are jerk for their own benefit? Uhm, so how do I get my needs to met now if I can't be say you never did that you don't you up on time what's going on, when are you? And when are we gonna have sex? And who came up with this anyway? It's the biggest thing and I-- that somebody said to us, who came over the idea of zero negativity? That's a crazy thing, which was very negative thing to say about us. 

00:47:10
POSITIVE WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT ZERO NEGATIVITY: ∙ There is nowhere this does not apply ∙ Brilliant-genius ∙ This will change the world ∙ I will go viral ∙ Potential to end war ∙ End of divorce ∙ No more child abuse ∙ Safety at last ∙ All good things come after negativity ends ∙ Each persons dream Goal to all religious traditions ∙ Dream of human heart is to live without judgment IMAGINE: A ZERO NEGATIVITY WORLD!! ∙ No more put downs ∙ No more shame, blame, criticism or contempt ∙ No more deflections ∙ No more harsh tones ∙ No more condescending eye rolls ∙ No more flights ∙ No more lonely nights on the couch ∙ No door slams ∙ No thick moments you can cut with a knife ∙ No more civil talk ∙ No more flooding with cortisol ∙ No more damaged children ∙ No more divorce ∙ No more Violence ∙ No more crime ∙ No more war THE ZERO NEGATIVITY PLEDGE We understand that "negativity" is any transaction that ruptures our connection whether international or not, but experienced as such by either of us. We pledge to make our relationship a zone of zero negativity for the duration of the workshop. To that end we pledge to monitor all our transactions and refrain from expressing a "put-down." If we experience a rupture, we will say "cuch" or some other signal we agree to use to communicate we have experienced a "put-down." We understand that it is our relationship that gets the frowning face not us as persons. It either of us experiences an "ouch" we pledge to restore connection immediately by using the dialogue process to show curiosity about the transaction, then re-doing the transaction and giving each other an appreciation. We pledge to gift each other with three appreciations each day, no matter what! 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:47:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, what we-- other things we've heard positive is that there's no ecosystem, no human ecosystem where zero negativity does not applied. That it is brilliant and genius we like that one. That it would change the world and we think it will. He will go viral, we think it will and it has a potential to in war because war is simply neg-- negativity derives to the lethal intric-- in her, ah, planet inter, ah, whatever. Groups fighting each other. It certainly will be the end of divorce, no more child abuse. The safety will be basically at last all of good came after negativity in and I-- it's every person's dream to live in a, ah, negativity zero free zone because negativity is simply a toxin. A human toxin is like, ah, second hand smoke. But I think and this also the goal of all religions traditions. And I think the phrase that we now recently have coined to talk about zero negativity is looking at everyone through the eyes of love. That you cannot actually love if you are negative because negativity is a negation and love is the absolute affirmation of the otherness of the other as okay. Thank you. So now, we have 10 minutes. So imagine living in a zero negativity world and now were put down some were ashamed blame criticism contempt to reflections are would like that. Descending tones no more fights no more lonely nights on the couch. Door alarms, thick moments you can cut with the knife and no more civil talk and no more flooding with cortisol, no more damage children, no more value. Hey, I like this. No more crime, no more work. So what we are asking to do now is to take this seriously and we invite to take as your negativity be pledge and we -- if we had time we'll walk this through that today but the pledge that for 30 days you will practice zero negativity. We'll also practice giving each other an appreciation of something your partner did that day, uhm, and that if you, uhm, fail to do that and as you do have a negative exchange that you'll use the dialogue process to, uhm, deal then. So Helen is now going talk about the third tool of the, uhm, of the process which is the relation care. 

00:49:35
THIRD TOOL: RELATIONSHIP CARE RELATIONSHIP CARE ∙ Not enough to end negativity, must put in relational nurturance PSYCHOTHERAPY TENDS TO FOCUS ON THE ILLNESS, THE WOUND, THE PATHOLOGY 265 Disorder in the DSM LV HERE'S A GREAT IDEA If you want relationship... Study HEALTH When we focus our brains on the positives and evoke positive energy, we reinforce those neural pathways. THE OPTIMAL RELATIONSHIP ∙ The optimal relationship ∙ Safety connection passion ∙ Keep the what couples require ∙ Rediscovering PLEASURE 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:49:35
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Yeah. A big thing we wanna say about zero negativity it's not, it 's not that you deal with issues and your frustrations. Zero negativity is not what you say it's how you say it. And good, uhm, couples therapy, good marriage therapy helps people talk , learn to talk to each other in a way that doesn't come across to their partner as negative and does there's more chance at their partners going to respond. Yeah. So, uhm, so basically I will just, uhm, uhm, point out that you have to as Harville said put in something, ah, interrelated relationship which is care, uhm, and, ah, it is so interesting to me that the DSM-4 had 265 ways you could be ill. And they had idea to find all the problem, uhm, diagnosis that in sometimes you could even have two. I mean everyone was given one or two or maybe sometimes three is a like we were racking up how to see ourselves as pathological. And what if there was, ah, DSM-4 or 5 was about joy. You know, how, how do we experience different ways to experience joy. But anyway we uhm, I heard a friend say about two years ago, "Hey, if you wanna have meal health study health." Practice health and so with that, uhm, when, uhm, Harville and I were, uhm, struggling in our marriage about 12 years ago. We were just so filled with, ah, constructive criticism that was my favorite, I was trying to be healthful. And I thought I was like, uhm, I was giving free advice that was very rise but it did land on her. I thought it was being benevolent and gracious and generous, uhm-uhm, you know, uhm, ah, so I had to learn to stop that part. We both for critical thinkers, ah, the best sense of the word but that can be very destructive for your marriage.

COUPLES AS TRANSFORMERS OF CULTURE 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:51:35
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT So what began to turn our marriage around and we now have their relationship of our dreams was, ah, putting up a calendar and have, ah, friendly face every time there is negativity as smiling face and then putting in appreciation we said, appreciations every single night, three, two each other and energy will follows attention. Our brains began to change. We began to make list of caring behaviors, so we been having our couples to do that and share caring behaviors through out the, ah, week. Surprises, uhm, create ideas that will be surprises, high energy fun we-- Harville and I been fun in paired it's what I called it. Uhm, because we both very serious especially when were together and we had to practice having fun. And our whole energy began to change and with laughter with joy comes with humor, uhm, become safety and then defenses go down, and then the authentic people could come out from behind their defenses and play with each other. Uhm, so, uhm, I will just begin to, uhm, say how couples can transform cul-- culture. The bottom line is that Sue Johnson, uhm, I've heard say but, uhm, uhm, that we've really got good help for couples now. We've really can help them dances it, Alan Bader and Pete Pearson and there's really good ways to help couples. We are around people who say we can end divorce on the planet. And Harville now, I, I actually believe that's true. 

00:53:15
 Yes. 

00:53:15

00:53:15
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT If we start early enough, if there are four hours in school we need to kids reading, writing, arithmetic and relationship. If when people get to a marriage license, uhm, they all-- they do what you have to do to get a drivers license or brokers license. Read a book on it, take a course pass a test and then you get your license. There's a science to it and the culture it hasn't, ah, figure that out but these theories of Sue's and etcetera, the-- they, they can the I love reading about six months the idea that theory can be moral, social ethic, ethical and political. And our couples theory in psychology is really as, uhm, Manuchant said the first night. Therapy is about a therapy for the culture. Uhm, so we believe we can create a tipping point of people who care about, ah, couples the hundred monkey. Ah, syndrome Harville says a, a good relationship is the best off spring prevention that will prevent down river clean up. A good marriage is off spring prevention for their ever clean up so that's what relationship first is really about. We were so excited to launch that here and Harville do you want to wrap up?

PROJECT DALLAS & PROJECT STATESBORO 

00:54:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Oh, you're talking about Dallas? 

00:54:45
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Uhm, well it's a three more minutes. And so I loved, I loved you to go in the last side. 

00:54:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX I think, think, yeah, three more minutes, okay. Oh, when, when I just mention - 

00:54:50
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT You can mention. 

00:54:50
RELATIONSHIPS FIRST Our Goals: ∙ ENGAGE people from all backgrounds in a national conversation on love, intimacy and couplehood. ∙ ENLIST leaders from the mental health field, faith-based institutions, academia and popular culture in promoting Relationships First within their communities. ∙ EDUCATE adults and youth about the value and benefits of building healthy relationships. ∙ EXPAND the arsenal of relational wellness tools for everyone who wants more fulfilling partnerships. ∙ EQUIP millions of couples with tools to build and sustain healthy relationships. VI. Couples as Creators of the Future Couplehood is the Fulcrum for Social Transformation Healthy Couples ↓ Healthy Children ↓ Healthy World 

00:54:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX - that, uhm, that-- the so the flow is couples is clients is one way to think about couples. What we are discovering as couples become more, ah, connected to each other that they become interested in something other than the relationship and that relationship becomes generative of an interested in, in social cultural change. And that, of, so Helen and I and following that have taken, uhm, connecting and dialogue to Dallas we were working on change in the whole city. Ah, raise the joy index of the whole city by focusing on improving the quality of couples interactions, ah, Helen, Helen's hometown Dallas my home town Statesboro, Georgia we're doing the same thing plus as many of you saw here, uhm, the , uhm, as in go back just for a moment that the, ah, we weren't by this a little fast. Ah, that relationships first is a collaboration to take this idea of the-- of fundamental power of relationship from the clinic into the culture. So if they haven't by the relationship first boost and its still there and I think some cards have been handed out if you may wanna fill up put him up here, ah, we can turn them in for you to go by that boost to see an attempt to take that, ah, re-- ah, that couples, ah, taking the relationships first into culture as a primary value. And then the last thing we wanted to say is that Helen and I are now working on is an idea that emerge is the founding of story of the Western World at least and of most other cultures is that universe that the first people on the planet, the first people in that were created was a couple the Adam and Eve story. That the couple was the original founding of culture. We know as you look through history that the way the family gets reconfigure than the couple we can reconfigure actually influences and transforms the culture of that. So couples as clients move to couples as cultural transformers and we think the next phase in the Evolution of Couplehood would be that couples will be the creators of the future. In the sense eventually this, uhm, a-- the, ah, the energy the Ying and Yang, the, uhm, the energy of the attention of the opposites. The expressive and, and receptive energy. How you wanna call the masculine and feminine? Ah, will eventually become structured in couples being leaders of the world. So that in someday of hundred years from now maybe a thousand there will be co-presidents and co-leaders of institutions. There will be couples will be in fact that the, ah, structure of the family in the homeless the healthy place will become extended to the structure of culture and society as a healthy place. And that, that would be regulated by the interaction of this two energies. So anyway that's our view of the way all of this can go in the next hundred or thousand years. And we thank you for indulging us in our thoughts of this morning. Thank you.
