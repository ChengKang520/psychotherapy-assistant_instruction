"Commentary on Treatment and Intervention" - Steven Lopez, Ph.D. - Linda Garro, Ph.D.

STEVEN LOPEZ Why celebrate? Come together. What's your pleasure? Okay. Actually, I wanted to stop this. Da-da-na-na-da. Okay, so the reason I wanted to play Kool & the Gang and Celebration is because I really think this is a celebration. I was a graduate student at UCLA interested in the study of culture and mental health, and now we have a group of experts, we have a group of students who are excited about culture and mental health. And one of the things that we share today is a celebration of this passion, of our interests. And, and largely, it's due to our own experience. How cool is that? We're not just studying molecules that we have no necessarily interest, maybe, some of you maybe are interested in molecules and maybe it's tied to your everyday life, but we just, so I see this is a celebration. I think Fred and Zorni and, and to see Joe Trimble, haven't seen him, and Nolan Zane, I haven't Nolan Zane for quite a while. So, so this has been fun. Um, and the new generation, thank you, uh, Dr. Alfiee, for pointing out that the new generation is there in the back and it's sat there over, I'm glad that you guys are here. So what are we gonna do? We're gonna talk a little bit about the key themes of the intervention presentations, uh, that we heard today. Uh, uh, we're gonna talk about some of the challenges that we see that cut across this field, and we're gonna present one small beginning effort to address some of these challenges, actually a joint project of Dr. Linda Garro, myself, and Dr. Alex Kopelowicz, a psychiatrist. So I think the underlying theme, and we've heard this in different, uh, times; professor Nolan Zane mentioned this, I think Dr. Breland-Noble mentioned this. Others have mentioned this, is what we're trying to do is to identify the promising directions where psychotherapy, mental health treatments match, are congruent, with our clients, and we've had a critique here that in the past issues of culture, race, and ethnicity have not been adequately addressed. And so our efforts are to match, to get closer to the socio-cultural worlds of people of color. Now, in terms of the themes, here are some of the themes that, that Dr. Garro and I have identified in the different presentations. One, we, you know, oftentimes when we think about culture and psychotherapy and mental health treatments, we think about individual cases in an office, one to one. And so one of, uh, Dr. Breland-Noble's point is that we're moving away from this, not moving away, but we're adding to this this systems of care, integrated care, substance abuse. And so what are the issues of culture, race, and ethnicity that play out I think is really important. Also we learned that there are few interventions that have good data based on RCTs for African American adults and African American youth. Also, I hear that as well with Asian Americans. And, and also Dr. Breland-Noble points out, although it wasn't the emphasis of her presentation, the importance of engagement. And one of the things I like about engagement is that it, it cuts across different kinds of disorders, it cuts across different kinds of interventions. And she gave us a lovely example of the, one of her cases, of, of African American families who don't buy into the idea of depression and how she negotiated that. That anecdote, I thought, was really useful. Uh, well, Linda pointed that out to me, and, and I agree with her that it's really useful. And Dr. Zane, um, his approach, uh, in contrast to Guillermo Bernal and also Dr., uh, Breland-Noble's, is about cultural competence. I don't know if you, uh, rather than culturally adapting evidence-based practices and, so he's not looking at specific treatments and modifying specific aspects or adding modules, but instead looking at processes, looking at the examination of relation of cultural factors associated with critical processes of therapy. Um, the example being, uh, one cultural factor, face is an important part of, of his work. Also issues of problem formulation, also coping strategies are different cultural factors. And they're tied to critical processes such as, um, credibility, for example. One of the important contributions is that, that their work goes beyond ethnicity or acculturation, as, as both he and Stan Sue, an important paper in American Psychologists in '87, I think it was, points out these distal versus proximal processes. So, so this idea of looking at shame is a proximal process, whereas ethnicity is a distal, uh, reflection of, of cultural processes. And then the most, one of the most important things is that, that they're operationalizing these, these cultural factors and they're studying them. They're seeing the relationship in, in therapy in terms of symptom outcomes and also in terms of self-disclosure. So that's a real important contribution. The last thing that we learned in additional slides is that he's operationalizing how to integrate culture and, and therapy. And I really liked, uh, Nolan, uh, your point that people are tired of heard they need to consider culture and they're not given the tools to, to do so, and your efforts to do so I think is really important. And then, uh, Dr. Bernal did a really nice job of being very comprehensive of all the studies that have been done, uh, evidence-based practices with Latinos, not only in the United States and in Puerto Rico but also across the world, uh, where they speak Spanish and they're dealing with Latinos, both in Spain or in, um, in Chile, for example. And one of the contributions is that he doesn't just look at depression or anxiety, although I would've hoped that there would have been more studies with anxiety. That really surprises me that there's very little regard to anxiety in, in Latinos. But typically we know about Latinos and CBT and depression, which he, which he points out. But he also goes beyond that and includes psychotic disorders, which is rarely considered, and other health conditions as well. I think that's a real important, uh, contribution. It was surprising that there wasn't much more attention to anxiety disorders. And we really liked, we really liked your call for the attention to more mechanisms of change. And I interpreted that, I don't know where you were going with it, but I interpreted it, Guillermo, as not only treatment mechanisms but also cultural mechanisms. And I think, and that fits in line with, with, uh, Nolan's presentation as well. And Beth Johnson and, uh, Jeannette, uh, Beth Boyd and Jeannette Johnson, uh, uh, the thing that really struck, uh, both Linda and myself and really appreciate it, grounding it in people's local social worlds. Um, um, uh, too often, I think, and this gets at that ethnic gloss, or cultural gloss, too often we don't make the connection between people's everyday lives and how that's related to specific cultural factors and specific cultural processes. And this whole notion of, uh, cultural, uh, trauma, I, I really appreciated learning about that. So your example, Beth, of, of a child going to a psychiatric hospital, being shipped away, and having lived in a, among a people where their kids are shipped away, you know, for this cultural, uh, whitewash, so to speak, that, that gives it a different flavor, doesn't it, than your kid has just been transferred to another psychiatric hospital. Um, so this idea of shared trauma, I think, is, is really important. Um, and then of course, like the Asian Americans, there's little on EBTs. But what we really liked, uh, is that this idea of cultural trauma is then tied to the intervention. And the intervention isn't so much about mechanisms of change, but I really liked this idea of a collective. You know, Joe, your work and, the two Joes, because that's what you cited, uh, this idea of culture as, as treatment, and how it's multi-layered. It's within a group, it's in a community. And it's not just about one to one kind of intervention but it's all the ways and the ripple effects that such an intervention can, can play. And so we saw that as process-oriented, understanding what's related to the functioning of a group or a community and tie that in closely with the intervention and trying to map that on. And so those were, those were some of the key themes that we took away as doing our due diligence to discuss what was presented. Uh, and we, we came up with some kind of dimensions. This may or may not work, but we thought on one end, this is maybe a continuum, uh, maybe two-dimensional, but we'll see. Uh, you know, the grounding of culture in the social world was most prominently reflected in, in, in the work of, of, uh, Johnson and Boyd, Boyd and Johnson. Um, and we think that's so important. And then attention to process. We saw that in these three presentations. Again, the linking of the collective trauma to the community revitalization notion. Uh, Zane and colleagues, don't, don't emphasize so much an understanding of the social historical process, but, but are very interested in processes and cultural processes, particularly as they relate to treatment. And Breland and Noble mentioned briefly the importance of engagement, which we see as more process-oriented. This idea of process-oriented, what does that mean? It's, it's, uh, for example, instead of a thing, you know, we, you need to get this treatment to this person or this person from this group, it's how do we know, how do we integrate culture, how do we assess, uh, the cultural part, how are, uh, like, uh, Nolan Zane, uh, noted, there's variability in terms of face, and that's related to, uh, uh, self-disclosure. So their more about process than the, than about developing a culturally informed treatment, a thing. I don't know if that makes the distinction clearly enough, but you guys can raise questions. And then obviously, this, you know, we're psychologists, we're scientists and the emphasis on evidence-based practice and strong methods and randomized clinical trials. Uh, Guillermo Bernal in his presentation, you know, clearly represents that. And as Dr. Alfiee, uh, Breland-Noble pointed out, that's what's gonna get funded. That's what, uh, how we're gonna help advance the field. Um, and so I think this captures kind of a range of, of, uh, approaches to the study of culturally informed mental health treatment that we saw today. Uh, and they're all important contributions. Now what we wanna do, uh, as I mentioned, we want to talk about some of the challenges that we see in this, uh, uh, approach or this direction of, of research, and then we wanna offer one small example of how we're trying to address some of these challenges. Let me mention briefly the challenges, and then I'd like to invite my, my colleague, Linda Garro, um, to come up. So, as I mentioned earlier, the overall goal is to do a better job of matching the experience of the treatment with our group or with our individual or with our community, uh, but one of our concerns, and this was mentioned in our discussion yesterday. The conceptualization of culture as anchored or tied to one's race and ethnicity is problematic. It certainly is helpful in terms of getting people's attention, uh, getting funding, the political aspects, promoting the goals of our communities, that certainly is important, but it's problematic when we really try to think about, uh, culture and, uh, mental health treatment. Uh, for example, okay, so we have a particular RCT for a particular group. How do we determine that somebody gets that treatment? Is it that they have, because they check the ethnic box or the racial box? And always the question I ask is would I want to get the treatment that pertains to my ethnicity? Would I want the clinician to say, "Tell me what's your ethnicity." I, I'm Mexican American, that's what we call ourselves in Tucson, Arizona. "Well, let's see, let me see. This treatment, no. Okay, the Mexican American treatment for marital problems. All right." That's not my only identity and I'm not sure that identity is central to this particular problem. It may be, but, so how do we decide, given our evidence-based practice for particular groups, how we assign them these interventions? And then the other thing is given the heterogeneity, the individual differences, how well does what we do in our RCTs or our evidence-based practice map onto the experience of folks? And it may be, for example, I mentioned yesterday this racial socialization in parent training, I think that's really important to include in parent training. But what if I'm a parent, and I don't think that's important? What, and then I get it, I have to get that? When I, when I don't, so I maybe wanna convince as a clinician that that's important, but that's, that may be problematic. And then one of the things that if you look at the slides, uh, uh, how many, where, we've got a long list of different interventions. And do we need an African American, a Latino, an Asian American for each of the kinds of treatments? A point that Anna Lau made in an important paper in 2006. So how do we, how do we conceptualize culture in a way that addresses some of these issues, and then how do we consider the individual and within group heterogeneity? And so with that, Professor Garro's gonna answer those specific questions. 

00:15:05
LINDA GARRO No I'm not! 

00:15:10
STEVEN LOPEZ Well, let me just say one thing. I've really enjoyed working with, uh, Linda Garro. I, uh, spent a semester at, uh, on a K Award at Harvard and did a little anthropology, and then I came back looking for a community and Linda has been a large part of that community to continue that anthropological, she's always, I always feel she's challenging me in a very supportive way. 

00:15:35
LINDA GARRO Well, it's challenging for me to be here as a anthropologist in an anthropology department. And so I'm gonna just talk a little bit about, um, this conference is organized around historically specific and politically important cultural categories of race and ethnicity. And, um, as people have pointed out, these categories have often served as a proxy for a culture. And just to sort of give a summary statement from Kirmayer, um, he writes, "Culture in the US has been largely, has been framed largely in terms of the five major ethnoracial blocs: African American, Asian American and Pacific Islanders, Latino, American Indian and Alaska white, Alaska native, and white. The definitions of these blocs conflate language, geographic origin, ethnicity, and race. They were created by the US census and have persisted because they serve the political function of identifying people with similar social predicaments who have made common cause to address some of the major inequities of US society." Now, as we all know, changes even in cultural practices such as the ability to select multiple identifications vis-a-vis race on the census are one indicator of the way people are starting to talk about and think about the increasing social heterogeneity of the United States. Recently in a book, um, called Shattering Culture, Mary-Jo Good and colleagues maintain that as culturally, cultural identities have increasingly become more complex, dynamic, fluid, and evolving, the certainty of these official cultural categories, the result of so much health and other government research has shattered, and, um, they actually have used the term, um, "hyperdiversity" to capture what they, what they say, is "those situations, situations in which the link between racial-ethnic identity and culture is weak or broken, shattered, and as a result, in which the broad identity-based indicators of cultural difference prove too blunt an instrument for navigating the social heterogeneity within today's clinical environments." Now, a number of comments raised yesterday about the complexities of social identities including the import of religion, gender, and variation in socioeconomic status are, um, consistent with this view. And yesterday, Joseph Trimble discussed ethnic gloss as, um, I went and looked it up on a website, as, as he talks about it "presenting an illusion of homogeneity where none exists among those grouped together under an ethnoracial label, a glossing which masks the real variation present among those subsumed." And then Joseph, uh, Elder Joseph, told us about a study in a Yupik community that attempted to understand stressful experiences in a local context. So one way to think about this variation is to think about smaller groups subsumed under a larger umbrella, the Yupik as one cultural group among many cultural groups under the label of indigenous populations of the United States. Um, and then from a quite very different perspective, one article concerned with designing culturally adapted evidence-based interventions discusses, and this is again with regard to, um, broad ethnoracial groups, characterized a population segmentation as an approach that otherwise, um, that narrows an otherwise heterogeneous ethnic population or group into a smaller and more homogeneous subcultural group to avoid ethnic gloss. I actually think the ontological problems with groups are, um, very difficult, but the central, and the central problematic of using a group as a proxy for culture is one that has been problematized by some anthropologists. So this is one anthropologist who wrote, "Historically, we used assumptions, not evidence, to equate cultures with social identities such as Nuer, Navajo, and African American. We also dismissed, overlooked, or downplayed both cultural variation among people who use the same social identity and cultural equivalence among people who use different social identities. Now, we're turning to Joseph Trimble's study in the Yupik community, um, in a study he discussed, um, where he talked about the importance of separately analyzing the comments of those who participated in the, in the study with reference to the English language concept of stress and those who talked about, um, such experiences in Yupik. So even in this single community, um, we're talking about pattern cultural variation in understanding that's associated with differential experiences associated with learning English. One way people have talked, talked about this variability is to change the focus from membership in one cultural group to multiple cultural groups. So one anthropologist, um, and it's Handwerker, um, he talks about how everyone participates in many cultures. Um, cultural ways of knowing, acting, and feeling, reflecting experiences with being a member of a religion, for example, would be a result of participating in that culture. And then two cognitively-oriented anthropologists, Naomi Quinn and Claudia Strauss, elaborate this, um, multiple cultures view. And they write, "To the extent that people have recurring common experiences, experiences mediated by humanly created products and learned practices, that lead them to develop a similar set of schemas," and what they mean here is cultural models, "it makes sense to say they share a culture. You share some experiences with people who listen to the same music or watch the same television shows as you do, and still others with people who have had formal schooling like yours, even if you live on opposite sides of the world. That makes each person a junction point for an infinite number of partially overlapping cultures." Now, my perspective is, is a bit different. For me, rather than referring to groups or groupings as cultures, I found it more productive to conceptualize culture, um, or the cultural, in relation to the socially-grounded processes that lead to patterns of sharing and variability in ways of thinking, acting, and feeling. This model of culture moves away from viewing individuals as members of different cultures, including those formulations in which individuals are seen to participate in variable numbers of multiple cultures. A process-oriented perspective highlights the import of experiences, in particular, sociocultural environments. It is linked to and dependent upon our social involvements within specific settings. Um, for examples, as an interacting participant, through exposure to the actions, ideas, and/or recounted experience of others through stories, as well as experiences mediated by humanly-created projects. And this involves both explicit and implicit cultural learning, um, seeing it as dependent upon experientially-based processes and participatory engagements in the world. So this experience is transformative, impacting on my body, while configuring possibilities for acting, feeling, and thinking, what we take to be reality. A process-oriented definition, perspective is by definition dynamic, both dependent upon experience and allowing for the possibility of both change, um, within a short time intervals and across the lifespan. Now, one focus of my work is focused on historically contingent, culturally available interpretive frameworks and the socially and structurally grounded processes through which individuals learn about, orient towards, and may become participants in ways of knowing. I've been particularly interested in narrative framings of experience that are drawn upon in times of illness or, um, when, um, with other forms of troubling experience. And narrative thinking can be seen as a type of culturally informed perspective taking on situated experiences and events. And I think this is a fundamental human way to understand life and time. It concerns not just the past and the present but also possible futures, as yet unrealized experience. Narrative thinking allies the culturally plausible with singular, um, circumstances. Now, yesterday, um, Joe Gone discussed the Holocaust model of intergenerational trauma, and Beth Boyd and Jeanette Johnson further discussed historical trauma and historical trauma response. My understanding is that this academic formulation of, um, this, um, explanatory narrative framework entered into academic discussions around the 1970s. However, as noted by the other presenters, this more academic formulation resonates with widely articulated themes in American Indian communities of cultural restoration in light of the disruption of cultural ways of life due to colonization. And it's not just contained by the boundaries of the US or even North America but also resonates with indigenous populations in other colonized settings like New Zealand or Australia. It's the perceived shared experiences of colonizations that offer both ideology and a route forward or toward the past through culture as treatment. One thing I take from this example is that a framework can be broadly shared but still be understood from a process-oriented perspective. It is a framework that has traveled to diverse settings. It is also a framework that offers individuals new ways of understanding their own difficulties. In one study carried out by James Waldrum in a Canadian detention facility, the availability of aboriginal spirituality programs in prison settings offered a route through which individuals, some of which were of aboriginal ancestry but who were raised in non-aboriginal foster or adoptive families and spoke only, spoke only English, um, way to acquire a new understanding of themselves and their past troubles. For some of these individuals, the path toward healing involved a willingness to learn new ways of viewing the world and of being in the world through their engaged participation with the elders leading the program. Through this process, individuals came to identify more as being an Indian and to see these ways of being and acting as, as offering a viable path for living, living in their future lives. What comes to be shared between the novice and the elder is a culturally grounded vision of a possible and hoped-for future that is oriented to the past and enabled by the steadfast engagement with this new way of being in the world. At the same time, I think it bears noting that the narrative frame connecting historical trauma with historical trauma response that results in wounding and distress, um, may not hold the same salience across all indigenous populations in the US. Aaron Denham, for example, presents an intriguing case study of a Coeur d'Alene family whose narratives of trauma and abuse are at the same time narratives of the importance of resistance and resilience in the face of adversity. These were narratives maintaining traditions and of becoming stronger and springing back despite historical trauma. And both of these are, are in this three-fold present, um, that does have the past and the future together. And I just wanna read a quote from, um, one, from one of these family members from, from, from, from a son recalling what his father would say. "A lot of pain and suffering our family has gone through, a lot of things that have happened to our family that were unjust, that were cruel, that were downright murderous, but we survived. My father would tell many other stories about pain and suffering and unjust things that happened to our family, and he would always bring it back to the center and say, 'Maybe the reason for that was so you boys can make a better life for your family.'" Um, speaking more generally, therapeutic settings offer opportunities to see how models of therapy provide a narrative framework for organizing trouble. One of the original insights of Arthur Kleinman's explanatory model framework, which lives on in the Cultural Formulation Interview, is that diagnostic entities offered by clinicians are explanatory models. One avenue to examine the cultural grounding of therapeutic interventions more generally is to examine how therapies offer narrative framings of what has transpired and what needs to happen to achieve wellbeing. Along these lines, anthropologist Rebecca Wester provides insight into divergent views of the cultural, moral, and relational terrain of psychotherapeutic practice through her comparative ethnographic study of two eating disorders clinics, one in the Midwestern US and the other in Mexico. She shows how despite concordance on the designation of anorexia nervosa at the diagnostic level, the two clinics are in practice treating what are fundamentally different diseases predicated two distinctive models of the agentive self in healthy adulthood. The hallmarks of healthy adulthood in the United States, self-sufficiency, individual autonomy, and emotional separateness from one's natal family, were judged by clinicians in Mexico to be so out of line with our experience here and, as another said, "out of sync with our cultural reality." Rather, the view of the healthy self compatible with psychotherapeutic interventions at the Mexican clinic was of a socially embedded and responsive person who takes an active, responsible role within a broader system of relationships. Um, in her paper, she takes a look at a group psychotherapy session at the Mexican clinic to show how patients in concert with the therapist reframe another person, another patient's narrative as an effort towards a radical reformulation of the patient's understanding of herself and more precisely, a reformulation of herself in relationship that they saw as the goal of treatment. So I'm going to turn this back over to Steve. 

00:31:50
STEVEN LOPEZ Well, I wanna applaud. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:05
STEVEN LOPEZ Okay. So thank you, Linda. I've gotta hold this. I'll put it in my pocket. All right. So this idea of, of the narrative. How do we use the narrative to promote cultural competence? And this idea, uh, how do we address the individual. Actually, Linda's points make a lot of, it's conceivable, for example, to do a EBT in Mexico and an EBT in the United States and have the same manual but the context, the sociocultural context may actually shape the outcomes differently, may actually shape in part the way in which it's being delivered, given what matters. So it's, what I take from your comments, Linda, is some of the complexities. Also, I'm concerned sometimes that clinicians' notions of culture are being imposed on clients of color, and they're not drawing it from the clients themselves. But your example of the, uh, prison study says there may be some value in, not imposing but considering, a cultural model that's drawn from, not your personal experience but from your group collective experience. It might be, there may be some value in that, in pushing that a bit. But obviously, there's some downsides of pushing your notion of culture onto, to clients. So the thing that we wanted to do, and we developed a model of cultural competence. We received an R34 from the National Institute of Mental Health. Probably won't go back to them for this kind of study again. But it deviates from the idea of culture as ethnicity and it tries to individualize treatment. And also, given the point that, that Professor Zane mentioned, it identifies what therapists' behaviors we think constitute cultural competence. And I'm gonna do that in nine minutes. So first of all, our conception of culture draws on Kleinman's notion of experience. And one of the things that I take from Kleinman's notion of experience, I used to think experience was in our mind or in our body, what we feel or what we think, and Kleinman in his understanding of experience, it's the nexus, it's that intersubjective medium between the mind, the body, and the social. And so the idea that the social is part of my experience was novel to me, but, uh, it emphasizes the social. The other thing that we do in our, in our model is that we consider people's stories, or narratives. I see that you guys are trying to see that last bit. That's good, because I, I hid the main point at the very bottom to keep you guys engaged. Um, anyways, to listen to people's stories and narratives, to identify what's at stake in their local social world. So our definition of culture is what's at stake, what matters to people, not ethnicity, not race, not national origin, given their local social world and given that there can be many social worlds. It's our job to figure out what's at stake. So those are our conceptions of culture. Now, the behavioral indicators are really centered around this idea of a shared narrative. The notion of our model is shifting cultural lenses. So you take the therapist's lens and you take the client's lens and you try to come up with some shared understanding. And how do you do that? You, as a clinician, you access the client's view, you integrate the, uh, client's view. For example, yesterday Dr. Alfiee said, you used the same terms. That's a way of integrating. Say, "I'm listening to you." You're integrating. So that's accessing and integrating. Then you present your view as a therapist. "In my opinion, I think that your son is suffering from depression. Here, let me tell you why I think that is." All right? "What do you think about that?" Getting the buy-in. Now, I supervise, uh, clinical psychology trainees. I've done a little bit of therapy in my time. I oftentimes don't see the clinician saying "It's my view." I hear, "You're depressed. You need antidepressant medication," or "We're gonna treat you with cognitive," not "It's my view that," or "I think this, and this is why I think that." There's not enough I-statements. And the value of the I-statements, after accessing the client's view, is that you're open to a negotiation and coming up with a shared understating. "Okay, we'll help you because you're tried. But just keep in mind that this is also something that we call 'depression.' That's fine, but, all right, what can we do to help you be less tired?" And that's negotiating a shared narrative. So the three behavioral indicators, accessing the client's perspective, presenting the therapist's view, and negotiating a shared understanding, which is reflected by integrating the client's view, by working towards buy-in, and negotiating a shared assent. "When we say you're tired, uh, you understand that I'm referring to depression as well?" Okay. Or "We'll call it, we'll call it 'tired' and focus on tired and not deal with your depression." You can negotiate it in many ways. Okay. What I wanted to do is to share, we have, um, videotaped and audiotaped 41 sessions in public mental health clinics in LA with Latino clients. When we wrote the grant, we wanted to take all comers because we think sociocultural factors pertain to everybody, but the review committee said "focus on Latinos." Okay, we'll focus on Latinos. But here's an example of a session, and see if you can point out the behavioral indicators. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN You, you live with this awareness that there's an audience 

00:38:10
STEVEN LOPEZ Can you hear in the back? 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Watching you a lot, in, in, in your children. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Okay. What do you think they're learning from you right now? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Trauma. Trauma. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN You think they're learning trauma from you? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Because I'm everyday crying, constantly. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN And them telling me, "Why are you crying now? Why are you crying now?" I try to make it a five-minute thing, but sometimes I'm cleaning and cooking or have the radio on, and I just, tears just fall. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yeah? And so they see those tears and they, they might ask about them. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN And you would like them not to see tears falling? Now, are they still seeing you cook while the tears are falling? 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Wow. What do you think they are learning about you in that? 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Negative. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Negative, really? What would they be learning about you that's negative in that? 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN Well, because I'm doing everyday chores. I'm, I'm doing my cleaning, cooking, laundry. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Yes, I'm hearing that. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN And, um, picking up my children too. Taking them to and from school. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN And I don't want them to think that I'm not happy doing it.

UNKNOWN Oh, okay. I see. You see, I, I had a different, a little bit different perspective on that, but I, I can see what you're saying. You want your kids to have a sense that you enjoy the life that you're making for them. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Okay. What, what I thought, what I thought your kids might be getting from that is that mom's pretty courageous, and she's very determined, and even if she is feeling things strongly, she keeps doing what we need in order to keep our home together and our life together. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Is that possible, for them to, to see it that way? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Yes. I never sat down to talk to them about it, but I hope that's what they're thinking. But in their minds I don't know what they're thinking. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Right. Right. 

00:40:55
STEVEN LOPEZ Okay, in that little clip, what you see is that the therapist does a very good job of accessing the client's view. "How do you, how do your kids see this?" "And what would you like?" "Oh, I see. But I thought, it's not trauma, I didn't see it as negative. I saw it as, as courageous. Is that possible?" "Yeah, you know, maybe." And so the therapist did a good job of accessing the client's view, did a good job of presenting his view as his view, and opened up the possibility of a negotiation.

STEVEN LOPEZ Actually, I have to end it there, but the, um, the point of this, just because of time, the point of this is that we're making the assumption, the therapist, in listening to the client's narratives, learned that her family and her kids are really important. And so initially she asks the, her to consider getting support. Uh, and she says no, no, you know, or thinking about happy memories, "No, that actually makes me feel bad." And then she says, "Well, I think it's really important for your family and your, etc., to, uh, I know how important that is. Would you consider getting support from other ways?" And she turned out to be open to that. So listening to narratives, keeping what's at stake, and then when there's a challenge, when there's a conflict, raising the possibility to go the next level to consider that, to consider what's at stake. I don't know, given the time, I have 30 seconds. Um, so. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Take another minute, Steve. 

00:44:25
STEVEN LOPEZ Take another minute. And actually, the client takes a small step forward and states that she's seeing loved ones happy gives her happiness. So the possibility of spending time with her family to make her feel better was, was, was good. Well, maybe I shouldn't've done that. Anyways, so our model of shifting cultural lenses is that, considers culture as the local social world, moves away from the sole focus on race and ethnicity. It can be race, it can be ethnicity, it can be some shared group notion, but it could be so many other things. But by listening to people's narratives, we can figure out what matters to them. And then this model focuses on processes, accessing the client's view, presenting your view, getting the buy-in, negotiating a shared narrative, and integrating what's at stake. And we think the real contribution of this, potential contribution, is that it individualizes treatment. It individualizes, it considers a sociocultural world, but it individualizes. And I thought, Nolan, you made a great point, that you can have these hypothesis about particular groups given past experience or knowledge, but we really need to individualize. Now the evidence. The training is feasible; I've done this to, uh, over 1,000 clinicians. We can do it. They see it in a very positive light. But we now need the RCTs, uh, to show that with this training we're gonna see the, uh, the kinds of outcomes that we expect. We actually did it with 10 individuals, and we didn't get the outcomes that we expected. So we're working on this. So in concluding, then, we think that we need multiple approaches, and we saw, we saw in the last two days multiple approaches to addressing culture, race, and ethnicity in our, uh, mental health treatment. We argue that culture is tied to our communities' local social worlds and, and through listening to narratives we're gonna have a better idea of what those local social worlds are. And we also think that basic processes, thinking about basic processes will help us individualize across disorders and also across groups. Uh, and then the final point, let's continue to celebrate this wonderful field, uh, that we're, happen to share. Thank you.
