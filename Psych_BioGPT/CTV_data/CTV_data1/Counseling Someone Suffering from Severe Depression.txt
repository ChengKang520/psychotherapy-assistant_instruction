00:00:00
DR. GLASSER We're ready to get started. I'm, um, haven't changed. I'm still Dr. Glasser (ph) and, uh, I'm going to be the therapist in this role play and I have Brandy Ross here. Brandy is gonna role play. She has a practice in Beverly Hills for quite a while. She's gonna role play one of her clients. So Brandy will be right here and I'll be here and we'll just get started. I think it's nice and quiet now so we'll get started. Brandy, uh, glad you came in today. Uh, could you tell me a little bit how you got to me? Did you get referred or how did it happen? 

00:00:45
BRANDY Well, I, I came, my friend said I better come and see you. 

00:00:50
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. So your friend knew about me? 

00:00:50
BRANDY My friend knew about you. You had really helped one of her friends. 

00:00:55
DR. GLASSER Oh, okay. Uh, that's a good start. Anyway, now what I start with, it's very simple. There's nothing for you to do except answer a few questions and say what's on your mind. Uh, everyone that comes to me has some kind of a story and I'd like to hear your story. 

00:01:10
BRANDY My story? 

00:01:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. You, there's something that around you or in your life or anything that your friend said you should see a counselor, so just kinda tell me a little bit about why you're here. 

00:01:25
BRANDY Well, my, I guess because my life is kinda changed. 

00:01:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah, uh-huh. 

00:01:30
BRANDY It, it's, I guess a kind of a surprise. 

00:01:35
DR. GLASSER Change and it's a surprise. 

00:01:35
BRANDY I guess. 

00:01:35
DR. GLASSER Well, explain it. I wanna hear it. 

00:01:40
BRANDY I'm married now and, uh, to a really good guy and I, I, I have a little boy, a little two year old. 

00:01:45
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:01:45
BRANDY And, uh, I used to work and now... 

00:01:50
DR. GLASSER What kind of work did you do? 

00:01:50
BRANDY I was a fashion designer. 

00:01:50
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:01:50
BRANDY Now I'm a, just now I'm a full time mom. 

00:01:55
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. And did you plan to become a full time mom? 

00:02:00
BRANDY I, I, I don't, I don't know if we kind of thought about all those things. 

00:02:05
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:02:05
BRANDY But... 

00:02:05
DR. GLASSER But the baby came and here you are, right? 

00:02:05
BRANDY Yeah, I had a career. It seemed, you know, my husband Brad, is, he's got a great job and he's head of a company and he's doing well and I was doing well but I guess it was sort of, I was the obvious person to kinda take care of our son, Brandon. 

00:02:25
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. And, uh, the baby's two years old now? 

00:02:30
BRANDY Uh-huh. He's doing great. 

00:02:30
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. So the baby's doing fine but you're a little bit, this transition has been, I guess the word, sometimes is stressful or something like that? 

00:02:40
BRANDY Well, I, I, my friend said to, you have to tell Dr. Glasser you're not doing very well. I'm not, I'm not doing very well. 

00:02:45
DR. GLASSER Uh, could you describe the not very well? 

00:02:50
BRANDY Well, not doing much at all. 

00:02:55
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Well you're not designing clothes right now. 

00:03:00
BRANDY No, I'm not. Not even thinking about that. 

00:03:00
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. But you're wearing clothes. 

00:03:05
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:03:10
DR. GLASSER You, you look at what you wear. You look in the mirror and everything. You look pretty good today. 

00:03:15
BRANDY Well, I, but, you know, it took a lot of effort to get just kind of up and out and here and I wouldn't, I don't think I would have come if my friend hadn't brought me. 

00:03:25
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. So... 

00:03:25
BRANDY I'm not going out very much. 

00:03:25
DR. GLASSER You stay mostly home. Do you have any help at home or do you take care of the baby all your... 

00:03:30
BRANDY Well, my husband got some help for me, 'cuz he was kind of worried that... 

00:03:35
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:03:35
BRANDY I, he was just worried. 

00:03:40
DR. GLASSER Kind of, he saw you were kind of having some difficulties, huh? 

00:03:45
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:03:45
DR. GLASSER Have you asked the little baby for some help? 

00:03:45
BRANDY No. 

00:03:45
DR. GLASSER Well, they're two years old. Pretty smart little kid. You could say hey, you can help mommy a little bit and things like that. You'd be surprised. 

00:03:55
BRANDY Well, what would I ask him to do? 

00:03:55
DR. GLASSER I don't know. He's your baby. Ask him anything. He won't care. He'll love hearing from you. 

00:04:00
BRANDY Really? 

00:04:05
DR. GLASSER Yeah. I mean, if he was eight months old or (inaudible ) but two years old, well I mean, he, you pretty much know what's going on at 2 years old. 

00:04:15
BRANDY Well he depends on me. That's, I think that's what I'm worried the most about. 

00:04:20
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Well, yeah. He's not gonna take care of you but he depends on you, that's right. 

00:04:20
BRANDY Really depends on me. 

00:04:20
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) How do you... 

00:04:20
BRANDY I'm letting him down, I think. 

00:04:25
DR. GLASSER How do you know he depends on you? 

00:04:25
BRANDY Well, he's, you know, he's this little beautiful two year old. 

00:04:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:04:30
BRANDY He needs, he needs my help. I, I'm even worried I don't even take him to preschool now. The nanny's taking him. 

00:04:35
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. He's in preschool at two? 

00:04:40
BRANDY Well, I wasn't doing much with him so we thought maybe he should go, at least, he goes three days a week. 

00:04:45
DR. GLASSER He seem to like it? 

00:04:45
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:04:45
DR. GLASSER Yeah, that's good. 

00:04:50
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:04:50
DR. GLASSER So it's a good choice, taking to preschool. And when he's at school, what do you do? 

00:04:55
BRANDY I'm, I'm just watching TV and reading and... 

00:04:55
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:05:00
BRANDY I'm not doing much. 

00:05:00
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. You went from a kind of a busy life to a different life, that's what you're saying? 

00:05:05
BRANDY Yeah. It's really different. I had a huge life. 

00:05:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
BRANDY I was, I was going to lunches. I was running, I, I was running that whole department. 

00:05:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:05:15
BRANDY It was going well. 

00:05:15
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Do the people from work still give you a call once in a while? 

00:05:20
BRANDY They do, but, you know, we're doing really different things now. 

00:05:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:05:25
BRANDY They're, they're someone who's, there's an interim person in my department now and she's doing fine. 

00:05:30
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:05:30
BRANDY And I mean, they consult with me, but I don't, I don't have that same role that I had. 

00:05:40
DR. GLASSER No, that's true. You can't, kind of easing your way into this new role and it's not real easy, no? 

00:05:45
BRANDY Well, I think I'm a good mom. 

00:05:45
DR. GLASSER I'm sure you are. You love the baby and that's a beautiful baby. 

00:05:50
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:05:50
DR. GLASSER And... 

00:05:50
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:05:50
DR. GLASSER And baby's even in nursery school and, at two years old, if he's in preschool, and he's happy there, that means you're a good mom 'cuz if you're not a good mom, they're very unhappy to leave you. He, he feels kind of secure, I guess. 

00:06:05
BRANDY Yeah. He cries sometimes. 

00:06:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:06:10
BRANDY Sometimes I take him. Not, the, the housekeeper doesn't take him all the time. 

00:06:15
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:06:15
BRANDY I take him sometimes. 

00:06:15
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. You drive the car over there? 

00:06:20
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:06:20
DR. GLASSER Okay. 

00:06:20
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:06:20
DR. GLASSER Do you do anything else, like, you know, do you have friends for example. Do friends come in? I mean, are there, do you know any young mothers like yourself? 

00:06:30
BRANDY A few but not very many. 

00:06:30
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30
BRANDY Most of my friends are still working. 

00:06:35
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:06:35
BRANDY Some of them, but I, I see a couple of my friends that, one of my friends has, the friend that brought me here has a, has a daughter but I, most of my friends are still working. 

00:06:45
DR. GLASSER And how about your parents? Are they involved at all? 

00:06:50
BRANDY Yeah. They're alive. They don't live nearby but they, they're alive. They're, they're wonderful. 

00:06:55
DR. GLASSER And your husband noticed that you weren't too happy and he suggested that, that, the, the preschool and things like that? 

00:07:05
BRANDY Well, he just wanted something. 

00:07:05
DR. GLASSER Oh. 

00:07:05
BRANDY He's working hard. He's busy. He's not here very much and he just wanted us to be happier. 

00:07:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:07:10
BRANDY He didn't, he doesn't think I'm very happy. 

00:07:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. How about, uh, how much do you talk with him about this situation? 

00:07:20
BRANDY Well, he's not very available. 

00:07:20
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
BRANDY He's not around. He's working really hard and, you know, he's supporting us now. 

00:07:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:07:25
BRANDY We had two incomes, now we have one. I mean, we're doing okay but that's, it's still a big change. That's a change too. 

00:07:35
DR. GLASSER Yeah, I guess like they say, this is something happening and you gotta kinda learn about it, don't you? 

00:07:40
BRANDY Yeah, I guess. 

00:07:45
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:07:45
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:07:45
DR. GLASSER And what do you think I can do for you? Counseling? That's what I am. 

00:07:50
BRANDY Well, I don't know. I wanna be sure I'm, I'm, I, I wanna be sure I'm okay. I wanna be sure I'm taking care of my son in the right way and being a good wife and being... 

00:08:05
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. Well, I'm not gonna make a big evaluation but you seem okay to me. You're a little bit nervous about the situation and that's normal. 

00:08:10
BRANDY Well, I think I'm sad a lot of the time. 

00:08:15
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Cry a little bit? 

00:08:15
BRANDY I cry a lot. 

00:08:15
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. And does anyone label what you are? I mean, have they called you anything or? 

00:08:25
BRANDY Well I saw my doctor. 

00:08:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah, what'd he say? 

00:08:25
BRANDY Well he, he was kinda concerned. 

00:08:30
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:08:30
BRANDY He thought, you know, he, he, you know, he talked about medicine. 

00:08:30
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Are you taking any medicine? 

00:08:35
BRANDY I have it. 

00:08:35
DR. GLASSER You have it? 

00:08:35
BRANDY Mm-hmm. 

00:08:35
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:08:40
BRANDY I have it. 

00:08:40
DR. GLASSER And, but you haven't taken any yet? 

00:08:45
BRANDY No, he gave me some samples. 

00:08:45
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Okay. Samples are medicine too. I mean, they're, the companies that make the medicine give it to him and then he gives it out to people and, in your case, you're taking medicine for people who are sad and cry a lot and stuff like that, I suppose. 

00:09:05
BRANDY Well, he said it would help. 

00:09:05
DR. GLASSER What? 

00:09:05
BRANDY He said it would help. 

00:09:05
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Now. 

00:09:10
BRANDY I, I'm thinking about it. 

00:09:10
DR. GLASSER I'm, I'm a doctor also and I could give you medicine but I have never given any of that kind of medicine. It's called, like, psychological medicine. I don't give it. I talk to people and I'd like to talk to you like I'm doing today and answer your questions, make some suggestions, and things like that. Do you have any kind of a plan for getting along in this situation, like when you get up in the morning are you just kind of, just saying well I'll see what goes on today or do you have a, maybe a little plan for the day? 

00:09:45
BRANDY Well, I, I don't really have a plan. 

00:09:50
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:09:50
BRANDY I mean, the same thing happens everyday. Brandon needs the same things every day. 

00:09:55
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:09:55
BRANDY He, I try to just, you know, help him out, be there for him. 

00:10:00
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:10:00
BRANDY And, um, what do you mean by plan? 

00:10:05
DR. GLASSER Well, like at two years old, he goes to the school but do you ever, like, say to yourself, gee I wonder if Brandon and I or maybe another woman with a little baby, we could all, like, go to the park. The weather's pretty good here and let him play there and things like that. Uh, because, uh, it's a plan. It's something you can do. 

00:10:25
BRANDY I am doing that sometimes but I don't know. It's just so different from the other life I had. It's kinda, it's, like, boring. 

00:10:35
DR. GLASSER Yeah. It is. 

00:10:35
BRANDY (crosstalk) And, and, so sometimes I just send the housekeeper. 

00:10:35
DR. GLASSER It was a, uh, exciting life and you had a staff and they depended upon you and all of the sudden, here you are with a little baby and a housekeeper and, you know. 

00:10:50
BRANDY I really, I thought it would be different from this. 

00:10:50
DR. GLASSER What did you think it was gonna be? 

00:10:55
BRANDY I don't know. I guess I thought it, I, I don't know. I thought it would be more fun. Maybe I thought, um, I, I didn't know it would be this much hard work. It's a huge amount of work. 

00:11:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:11:10
BRANDY And it's a different kind of work. 

00:11:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:11:10
BRANDY I don't know. I, it's a kind of a surprise. 

00:11:15
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Well, you mention an important word, fun. In your previous life, you had fun. 

00:11:20
BRANDY Yeah, I had a lot of fun. 

00:11:20
DR. GLASSER What did you do that was fun? Just tell me. That's all. 

00:11:20
BRANDY Well, I was really good at my work. I, I, you know, I'm a designer and... 

00:11:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. It was fun to design something. 

00:11:30
BRANDY Really fun. 

00:11:30
DR. GLASSER And then people looked at it and liked it and all. That's fun, you know, to, to be appreciated and approved and, and all these things and, uh, it, it is something that's kinda hard to get in this life but maybe you could figure out some things that you could do with this life which would be certainly different but I like the word fun. I think we all need fun. I really do believe that and what could do with Brandon that you think would be fun? You have some help and things like that? 

00:12:00
BRANDY Well, maybe I, maybe I could do more things with him. 

00:12:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:12:10
BRANDY Maybe there's some projects or something that I should be doing with him. 

00:12:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. And you could kinda, see, talk to him. Do you talk to him much? 

00:12:20
BRANDY Yeah, I talk to him. I think I talk to him. 

00:12:20
DR. GLASSER Yeah. And then you enjoy talking to him a little bit? He's not like talking to colleagues at work but, uh... 

00:12:30
BRANDY No, I love him very much. 

00:12:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:12:30
BRANDY And I, I do love talking to him. 

00:12:35
DR. GLASSER Well good, good. 

00:12:35
BRANDY you know, he's, he's a lot of work but no, I.... 

00:12:40
DR. GLASSER Well the words that you're gonna say to him don't come as easily as, say the words at work and things like that? It's something, see, it's a learning process and you don't have any choice but to learn it but the thing is, you can learn it more easily and you're not learning it real easily right now and that's why I'm talking with you. 

00:13:00
BRANDY I think that's the difference. I thought I would learn it easily. 

00:13:05
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:13:05
BRANDY I thought, you know, I wanted this role. I, I thought I'd just be good at it. I thought I'd slip right into it. 

00:13:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:13:10
BRANDY Just a surprise to me, I think. 

00:13:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah, it's the big difference between the two. Brandon is kind of right there all the time, isn't he? 

00:13:20
BRANDY Yes, 24/7. 

00:13:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah, yeah. He's, he's, he's not gonna go to work with your husband or anything like that. 

00:13:30
BRANDY No. 

00:13:30
DR. GLASSER And does your husband spend time with him? 

00:13:35
BRANDY Yes. But not very much. Not as much as he wanted. 

00:13:40
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:13:40
BRANDY He thought he'd spend more time with him. 

00:13:40
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:40
BRANDY But his hours are just huge. 

00:13:40
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:13:45
BRANDY And... 

00:13:45
DR. GLASSER But he has some time, maybe. Does he have, like Sunday to spend with him or anything like that? 

00:13:50
BRANDY Sometimes, yeah. His mom lives here so sometimes he spends a lot of time on Sundays with her. Sometimes he takes Brandon and they, they kind of go together. 

00:14:00
DR. GLASSER He spends time with his mother. 

00:14:00
BRANDY Sometimes, yeah. 

00:14:00
DR. GLASSER And when you think about his mother, you can tell me, I won't tell anyone else, what do you think about her? 

00:14:10
BRANDY Well, she's, she's okay. She's, we're not real close but she, we're not real close but I, I like her. I think she likes me. 

00:14:20
DR. GLASSER He's pretty close with her. 

00:14:25
BRANDY He's close with her. He, she, she loves her grandson. 

00:14:25
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:14:25
BRANDY Loves him. 

00:14:25
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. 

00:14:30
BRANDY That's the only grandson so far. 

00:14:30
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. And who, uh, were you ever really close to his mother? 

00:14:35
BRANDY Not, not really. I mean, yeah, I always, we, we would have her over for dinner. She would come to dinner. We'd spend some time but not, not, not real close. He lost his dad a few years ago and... 

00:14:50
DR. GLASSER So she's without the, the husband and, and how many children does she have? 

00:14:55
BRANDY Just my, just my husband. He's an only child. 

00:15:00
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:15:00
BRANDY But she, she's really busy. She's active. 

00:15:00
DR. GLASSER I see. 

00:15:00
BRANDY She has a, she has her clubs and she plays cards. She has a nice life. 

00:15:05
DR. GLASSER You're not the kind of person, she's not the kind of person you'd like to hang around with. Is that right? 

00:15:10
BRANDY No. Not very much. 

00:15:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:15:15
BRANDY I don't think so. We're, we're, we're pretty different, I think. 

00:15:15
DR. GLASSER And... 

00:15:15
BRANDY I mean, I, I, I do do things with her but not a lot. 

00:15:20
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. I don't think you do many friend things with her, is that what you're saying? 

00:15:25
BRANDY Right. 

00:15:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:15:25
BRANDY Well, maybe I could do more. I don't know. Maybe that's something I should do. 

00:15:30
DR. GLASSER Well, possibly. Possibly. Might be hard but, uh, you, this is, see, there's several new things in your life right now. There's the baby, who's very, very new and there's a mother in law who is kind of new also in this role as the grandmother and things like that and you feel uncomfortable around her? 

00:15:55
BRANDY Well, she, she has her ways with Brandon and she does a lot of disciplining of him and kind of, you know, ordering him to do things and I don't, I don't, I don't do that. 

00:16:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:16:10
BRANDY So, I think we're, we're kind of different in maybe the way we're gonna parent and I, I don't like that very much. 

00:16:20
DR. GLASSER Mm-hmm. So this is something that you really, course you've never had a mother in law, grandmother before in your life and probably you never thought about it. 

00:16:30
BRANDY Well my parents aren't like that. I mean, they're not here. They're in another city but when they come and visit, they're just kind of there. They're like me, they're a little more easy going and so that's, I guess that's, that's another change for me is, sort of, now somebody else is kind of having her, I don't know, kind of bossing my son around. 

00:16:55
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. Uh-huh. And at work, you bossed people around, didn't you? But I'm not saying it in the bad sense but you were leadering at work now... 

00:17:05
BRANDY Yeah. Well I was the head of my department and... 

00:17:05
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:05
BRANDY I, I, I think that went okay. I think I was well liked and... 

00:17:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:17:10
BRANDY My designs were quite popular. 

00:17:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:17:15
BRANDY I still make some suggestions but I don't, I don't have as big of a role 'cuz of this. I'm kind of on a hiatus. 

00:17:20
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:17:20
BRANDY I, I think I'll go back in a few years. 

00:17:20
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:17:20
BRANDY I have, I have that chance. 

00:17:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. Probably that will work out pretty well but right now, you gotta kinda work things out a little bit and seems to me, you know, you say, what we talk about is between us. It never goes anywheres else. It seems to me that, uh, right now, the mother is, the mother-in-law, who has lost her husband and is quite close to your son and, this is something you just have to kind of work on a little bit. 

00:17:55
BRANDY What do you mean, how, work on it? 

00:18:00
DR. GLASSER Well, you're dissatisfied with the relationship between yourself and her and yet she's not gonna go away and you're not gonna go away, so maybe you oughta figure out how to deal with her a little bit better. 

00:18:10
BRANDY Mean, tell her, like, I don't like what she says to Brandon? 

00:18:15
DR. GLASSER Uh, that's kind of what I'm saying, yeah, but do it in a way that she kind of, see, she looks at you and how you deal with him and sometimes mothers-in-law like that, with an only child and everything, they kinda, when they look at you and they send a message that you're not very capable at what you're doing. Do you feel that? 

00:18:40
BRANDY I think she's really judgmental. 

00:18:45
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:18:45
BRANDY I think she talks with my husband about it. 

00:18:45
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:18:45
BRANDY And I think they don't include me in that. 

00:18:50
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:18:50
BRANDY And she's got her ways. They have their ways. 

00:18:50
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:18:50
BRANDY It's like I'm the odd person out. 

00:18:55
DR. GLASSER Yeah. And that's what perhaps you and I could talk about because you need some help in that role. It's a very difficult role. 

00:19:05
BRANDY Well, I try to talk to Brad about it but he's, doesn't have a lot of time. He doesn't care much. 

00:19:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:19:10
BRANDY I mean, I'm spending more time with his mom and the baby then I am with him and the baby. 

00:19:15
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. And... 

00:19:20
BRANDY Should I, what would I say to her? Her name is Grace. What would I say to Grace? 

00:19:25
DR. GLASSER Grace is her name, huh? That's a good thing. What would you like to say to Grace? 

00:19:30
BRANDY Well, I don't know. I don't, I think I'm not saying anything 'cuz I, I, I, I know the way I am now. I don't think I'd be very effective. So I don't say much. 

00:19:45
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. But it's you're not saying much that leads you to feel kind of not too effective. 

00:19:50
BRANDY Right. 

00:19:50
DR. GLASSER Yeah. So it's kind of a, a thing that grows a little bit unless... 

00:19:55
BRANDY Yeah. I just, I just want her to be, I, I don't know, less bossy. Just, I want her to be a little quieter. 

00:20:05
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Uh-huh. How often does she actually come around? 

00:20:05
BRANDY Oh, she's coming quite a bit lately. 

00:20:05
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. 

00:20:05
BRANDY I think she thinks there's something wrong with me. 

00:20:10
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. Well, there is something wrong with you. 

00:20:10
BRANDY There is? 

00:20:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:20:15
BRANDY What's wrong with me? 

00:20:15
DR. GLASSER You're just a little overwhelmed by this situation and she's taking advantage of it too. Kind of to say to her son, boy, if, kind of if your mother was having it would be a lot better. You know, that kind of a thing? These things happen. People don't get along as well with each other as they would like to. It's a tough problem. That's why you're here to get some help. 

00:20:45
BRANDY I've been, I thought getting along as, well, I've gotten, I have friends. I got along in life fine. 

00:20:50
DR. GLASSER Yeah. But this is a different situation. This is a husband that works very hard. I'm sure he loves you and everything else but he's, in a certain sense, he's kinda a little bit turned you over to his mother. 

00:21:05
BRANDY Hmm. 

00:21:05
DR. GLASSER You gotta kinda deal with that and... 

00:21:10
BRANDY I guess I hadn't thought of it that way. 

00:21:15
DR. GLASSER Well, if it's, if I, if I've made a mistake, tell me. I mean. 

00:21:20
BRANDY No, I, I just... 

00:21:20
DR. GLASSER I mean, it's not an uncommon situation and she kind of likes it a little bit and you don't like it a lot. And there's some things you already have to do at home with her and even with your husband that could resemble some of the things you did at work when you were the head of the fashion department. 

00:21:45
BRANDY I don't see anything about this job like that. 

00:21:50
DR. GLASSER Yeah, because everything went well in that job but this is a new fashion department. 

00:21:55
BRANDY A new fashion department. 

00:22:00
DR. GLASSER And you're no longer the head of this new fashion department and I think you kind of have to, they call it assert. I'm not real big on asserting, asserting, asserting, but sometimes you gonna have to send her some kind of a message that this is a place where I'm learning but I can learn pretty quick and if she'd like to help you, that would be fine and if she doesn't want to help you, then maybe she oughtn't to come so often. It would be a real, real different experience for her if you said you know I think, uh, I'm kinda feeling that you're around a little bit too much. 

00:22:40
BRANDY Oh, I'd really, if I told her that, oh, she'd be so hurt. Oh my. Oh, she'd be so hurt. 

00:22:50
DR. GLASSER Well I think hurt is not exactly the right word. I think she'd be so angry. 

00:22:55
BRANDY You do? 

00:22:55
DR. GLASSER Yes. I think she's probably not a stupid woman and I think she already realizes she's overstepping her bounds but she's using your kind of crying and other things, which she knows about even though she may not see you. You may tell her and things like that. You're vulnerable and she's taking a little advantage of you. See my job, as I see it, I'm on your side. You're my client and I'm very much on your side and anyone that hurts you is, in a kind of a sense, hurting our relationship too and I, I wanna kind of convince you that we could, we could do some real things together here and learn some stuff like do you ever, during the daytime, have a feeling gee, I don't know what to say in this situation. Did you ever think you could pick up the phone and call someone? Someone that knows you? Because I'm getting to know you pretty well already. 

00:24:00
BRANDY Well I can, I can call someone. I could do that. 

00:24:00
DR. GLASSER Who would you call? 

00:24:00
BRANDY I, I couldn't call my mother-in-law. 

00:24:05
DR. GLASSER No, not her. 

00:24:05
BRANDY And you know, this idea that I'm gonna tell, kinda tell her to stay away, I, I, you know, I'm trying to think about that. 

00:24:10
DR. GLASSER Oh, I'm not saying you do it immediately. 

00:24:15
BRANDY (crosstalk) And I think I, I couldn't do that. 

00:24:15
DR. GLASSER Ah, but you could think about it. 

00:24:15
BRANDY I'll think about it. 

00:24:20
DR. GLASSER 'Cuz you're gonna think about it, whether you want to or not. You've been thinking about it. 

00:24:20
BRANDY It's true. 

00:24:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. So I'm just suggesting that when you're in a little bit of a quandary, you can't call your doctor. That's not the kind of doctor you can call. The pediatrician will say the little baby is doing wonderfully but I could be a person you could, like, call. You don't have to run in here. Just say Dr. Glasser, I've got this new situation now and I'm having difficulty handling it and sometimes I could kind of give, see, I give advice. Some, some counselors won't give advice for some reason, they don't. But I, I give advice. That's what I do. You're paying me and I'm gonna give you some advice, but it's your job to decide whether or not the advice I give you is good advice. So what we could do is we could kinda plan a little bit ahead of time and see as you, what's a situation where you might wanna, not tell her not to come around so much but just tell her something and come across to her as someone who knows what I'm doing. Does she interfere with, like, your meals or anything like that? 

00:25:40
BRANDY No, but maybe we could go do something together. 

00:25:40
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:25:40
BRANDY Maybe, maybe if she just didn't come over and hang out and, I hate that. 

00:25:45
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:25:45
BRANDY 'Cuz she sees me and I'm just hanging out in the house and maybe, maybe we should go somewhere and do something together. Maybe, I don't know. 

00:25:55
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. What would you like, maybe she'd even be better off in that. What, what do you suggest that they might do together? 

00:26:00
BRANDY Well, I, I, really, there's something at the Science Museum that's kind of really fun and for little kids. I thought maybe, I think I should take Brandon to see that or... 

00:26:10
DR. GLASSER Where? 

00:26:10
BRANDY I, it seemed like such a big effort. I haven't done it but I thought about it. It's here. It's here still through the, through this month. So, I don't know. She'd go with that. She's real active. She'd maybe go with us. 

00:26:20
DR. GLASSER Yeah. She's not an old woman or anything like that. 

00:26:25
BRANDY Well, she's older, but she's, she's active so maybe, maybe if we did that and we weren't just hanging around and she was, you know, two people bossing my poor old boy, maybe that would be better. 

00:26:40
DR. GLASSER Yeah. And how would you approach her on that? We could just rehearse a little bit now. 

00:26:45
BRANDY Well, I could just call her and say, you know, Grace, I, I, you know, I'm gonna, I thought, I'm thinking of going to the museum to see this exhibit but I thought it's on dinosaurs and prehistoric animals and I thought Brandon would really like that. He really loves that stuff. 

00:27:00
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah, little kids, somehow or other like those kinds of things, even when they're real little and... 

00:27:05
BRANDY I'd just say let's go. Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try and organize it and let's go. 

00:27:10
DR. GLASSER And... 

00:27:10
BRANDY Maybe I should take one of my friends. My friend that came here. 

00:27:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:27:10
BRANDY You know, she has a little girl. They're about the same age. 

00:27:15
DR. GLASSER Go with your friend. 

00:27:15
BRANDY (crosstalk) We met in a Mommy and Me and we're best friends. So maybe she should go with us. 

00:27:20
DR. GLASSER Uh-huh. And if you asked your friend, she'd probably pretty much say yes? 

00:27:25
BRANDY She, oh, yes. She loves me, that friend. 

00:27:25
DR. GLASSER And... 

00:27:25
BRANDY She'd go. 

00:27:25
DR. GLASSER And how about going with your friend and enjoying yourself and not making this a kind of a mother-in-law, don't include her. 

00:27:40
BRANDY Don't include her? 

00:27:40
DR. GLASSER You can tell her you went with your friend and had a marvelous time and maybe you could go several places with your friend and then you could tell your mother-in-law what a good time you're having and how much fun it is to take your baby out with another mother with a baby. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:00
DR. GLASSER 'Cuz that would be the truth. And my father always taught me, I had a father, you know, and he always taught me, he said the best lie is the truth. 

00:28:15
BRANDY You don't think it'll hurt her? 

00:28:20
DR. GLASSER Well, I'm not terribly worried about that. How much are you worried about it? Does this woman strike you as a very vulnerable individual? 

00:28:30
BRANDY I don't know. Now that I listen to you, I think maybe the vulnerable one is me. 

00:28:35
DR. GLASSER I think so too, yeah. See, it's a, you're in a different situation. The only situations we're ever in all of us in life, are situations with people. I mean, when you're designing clothes, the cloth never gives you any trouble or that kind of thing. It's the people and people are tough to get along with. You know what people do? People that, having difficulty and you're having very, kind of difficulty of the most common kind. You kind of have a feeling, and I believe you're correct, correct me if I'm wrong, that this woman kind of enjoys controlling things. 

00:29:15
BRANDY Oh, that's right. 

00:29:20
DR. GLASSER Yeah. She's a controlling person. 

00:29:25
BRANDY She's got her one son, she's controlled him. 

00:29:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah. And maybe her son is kind of a little bit afraid of her too. Well, his father's gone now and, you know, he feels certain things. 

00:29:40
BRANDY No. 

00:29:40
DR. GLASSER Maybe he doesn't realize, this is also possible, and the way she talks to him, it may be hard for him to find this out, but she doesn't realize that maybe she's trying to take a little control in your house. Now you say he runs a business. He's not stupid or anything like that. He fights with issues of control all day long and this one is right at home and he probably doesn't even understand that it's there. 

00:30:20
BRANDY I think he doesn't. 

00:30:25
DR. GLASSER He doesn't. Yeah. 

00:30:25
BRANDY I think he doesn't. 

00:30:25
DR. GLASSER So how to tell him would be not so much about that but you could tell him, you know, I've been doing more things with my friends and not with your mother and we're having a real good time and that would be a way to kind of tell him, in a certain sense, that you're kind of taking control at home, which he would like. 

00:30:50
BRANDY I can do that, I think. 

00:30:50
DR. GLASSER Yeah. Because, is, is this difficult talking about this? 

00:31:00
BRANDY Well, I'm just, I, I'm thinking that maybe this is a good idea. 

00:31:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:31:10
BRANDY I, I, I think it might, I think I might be happier. 

00:31:10
DR. GLASSER I think you would be happier. 

00:31:15
BRANDY (crosstalk) I don't know. I think I, I think the situation got bigger than I realized. I think I, I, I think I just sort of let it.. 

00:31:25
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) It kind of crept up on you and there it was, huh? 

00:31:25
BRANDY It did. 

00:31:25
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:31:25
BRANDY I let a lot of things go and I, I'm kind of feeling bad about it now that I think about this. 

00:31:30
DR. GLASSER As you... 

00:31:30
BRANDY (crosstalk) Do you think I should take this medicine that this doctor gave me? 

00:31:35
DR. GLASSER Well, I'm a psychiatrist. I know a lot about medicine and I think the medicine could harm you. 

00:31:40
BRANDY Harm me? 

00:31:40
DR. GLASSER Yes, it could harm you. It frequently does. You don't want to get anything else in your brain. Your brain's got enough to do now without having to fight medicine. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:31:55
BRANDY Wow. 

00:31:55
DR. GLASSER I mean, I feel obligated to tell you that and if we get to see each other, I can give you a lot of information about that, 'cuz that's something I know a lot about and I know a little bit about how your brain works and your brain also, all of our brains tend to fight control. It's a very important way our brain works. When you were going to school, did you ever have a really controlling teacher? 

00:32:30
BRANDY Sure. 

00:32:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah. They're plenty around, you know but in school, you get... 

00:32:35
BRANDY You know, didn't your mom say, my mom always said that you'll grow up and that'll be your best teacher. You'll just, you'll remember her. She was your best teacher ever. 

00:32:45
DR. GLASSER Well, that's a way of looking at it. Some tough teachers are good teachers. But being tough and being controlling are two very different things. Tough is good. Controlling, whenever you get in a relationship where one person's trying to control another, that relationship is harmed. I'm sure you had a big staff at work and you probably had to sort out things between people periodically too, I'm sure. 

00:33:15
BRANDY Yeah. I, I'm pretty good at that. 

00:33:15
DR. GLASSER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:33:15
BRANDY (crosstalk) I was, I was good at mediating between, you know, if, if... 

00:33:20
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. And now you gotta sort things out at home. You got a husband, a mother-in-law, and a baby. That's the whole business right now and you've a little lost control of the business 'cuz generally, in that situation, who kind of naturally assumes control? The husband, the mother-in-law, or the mother? 

00:33:45
BRANDY Well... 

00:33:50
DR. GLASSER It's you, wasn't it? 

00:33:50
BRANDY I think, I think this is really, I think this is really helpful. 

00:33:55
DR. GLASSER And there's more. 

00:34:00
BRANDY Maybe I can get a little more back. I guess I stopped being a, a little bit. 

00:34:05
DR. GLASSER Yeah, you let someone else run the business for a while and it didn't work. Yeah. Someone that was very happy to run it and happy to tell another member of the business, your husband, I'm running it for a while. Don't worry son. Everything's gonna be fine. 

00:34:20
BRANDY Wow. 

00:34:20
DR. GLASSER So these are things that, when you go to a counselor, these are the things you kind of learn and it'll take us some time to learn it and you read a lot anyway and I have written a little book here, very, very short book. Thirty-one pages, big print and if you would, and I'll give it to you. I don't sell the book. It costs me 42 cents, you know. It's no big deal. Now, between now and the next time we talk to each other, read this book carefully and kind of think of your life in terms of the things that I explain in the book. It's a lot easier to read a book and learn these things then for me to spend some, I've been explaining a lot to you but you, you read the, you read the book. Can you read the title there? It's called... 

00:35:25
BRANDY Sure. Defining Mental Health as a Public Health Problem. 

00:35:30
DR. GLASSER Yeah. See. I think, you know, there is such a thing as mental health and mental health is when you get along well with other people and you hold your own with them and you like them and everything but you don't boss them and they don't boss you. It's the bossing that gets in the way of everything and this will explain it very clearly. 

00:35:55
BRANDY Thank you. 

00:35:55
DR. GLASSER Do you ever have the feeling that, you know, that you want to, uh, kind of tell, like, your mother-in-law, keep quiet? 

00:36:05
BRANDY Yeah. 

00:36:10
DR. GLASSER Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, this will kind of explain how you deal with it. Just don't use the book until you have a chance to read it and talk it over with me. We could have a very good session on the book and the book will introduce you, in a kind of a new way, to the parties that are running your book, your business and the one party that's running part of the business which we didn't mention is very competent at it and you don't have to worry about that party at all. That's the baby. He goes off to nursery school and he enjoys himself and he still, he, he... 

00:36:50
BRANDY Well I think I better go with him more. 

00:36:55
DR. GLASSER Yeah. Well, you better do a lot of things with him more and with other people and create a nice life. It might turn out to be such a good life that you'll even have another baby and even delay the time in going back. This is a kind of different, this is a business with the baby. You really own this business. You know? It's yours and if you try to sell it, nobody will buy it. And yet it's a very important business. And you, and you knew that when you were getting into it but you didn't quite realize all the complications and my job is to help with the complications. So will you read the book and then... 

00:37:35
BRANDY Sure. 

00:37:35
DR. GLASSER You have free time, you can come almost any time. How about coming in about three or four days and spend another half hour, 45 minutes together, whatever it takes? 

00:37:45
BRANDY I, I just have to tell you that I'm not gonna, I don't think I can do that idea of yours of telling Grace just not to come over. 

00:37:55
DR. GLASSER No, no, no. No. We just talked about that. 

00:38:00
BRANDY I can't do that. 

00:38:00
DR. GLASSER You, you might be able to send a message to Grace in a way that she'll pick it up without you actually saying it. 

00:38:05
BRANDY Okay. 

00:38:05
DR. GLASSER There's a, there, there's ways to send messages to people and one message you send to Grace, which I think you agree with, is Grace, I'm pretty capable of taking care of this baby and going places and dealing with my husband without your help. You do it subtly but the message gets in the air and Grace, she has a life of her own. She has friends and other things and, to a certain extent, she'll feel well, it's okay to kind of ease off a little bit. These are, I mean, life is kind of subtle but reading this little booklet can help you a lot with understanding and then talking about it. It's called Putting Choice Theory to Work In Your Life and Choice Theory is the theory of making better choices than you're making now. Okay? 

00:39:00
BRANDY Oh, I'm real, I'm really grateful. I'm grateful to my friend. I think this... 

00:39:05
DR. GLASSER Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:05
BRANDY I think this was a really good thing. 

00:39:10
DR. GLASSER Yeah, that's great. 

00:39:10
BRANDY I think it's helped me a lot. Thanks. 

00:39:10
DR. GLASSER Okay, well, I appreciate you coming in and we'll have a little relationship for a while, see each other once a week and talk occasionally on the phone and may even come a time when I'll ask you to read another book, but this is plenty to start with. 

00:39:25
BRANDY Well, I have reading time. That was for sure. 

00:39:30
DR. GLASSER Okay. All right. So thank you very much. 

00:39:35
BRANDY (crosstalk) Oh, thank you so much. 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:40
DR. GLASSER Okay. Okay. I'm, I'm looking at the time and, uh, we still have, we still have time and, uh, in, if it were the real situation, I might have taken a little longer, things like that but generally when I counsel, I kind of went by the clock but it didn't control me. There, there's an old saying that maybe I could tell you this. Margaret Mead, there's someone here that used to work with Margaret Mead. I think it's Houston or someone like that and I never knew Margaret Mead but I heard stories about her and she used to go to the islands of the South Seas there and she'd live with the natives and things like that and, uh, then well, we were talking about things she was saying to the natives. You know, uh, you know, we, or, or she mentioned to the natives that the natives had a little god there and they consulted the god once in a while when they needed something to do and Margaret Mead was talking and said to them, you know, you consult this god quite a bit and they said well, we do. That's true. But not as much as you consult your god. And Margaret Mead said our god? Yeah, he said. We just consult our god. You wear your god around your wrist and you consult him all the time. So, again, I, I like this god here but he doesn't, I just consult with him, that's all. I don't, I don't, I don't really let him control me in anyway. So anyway, the, the thing is that, uh, Brandy, uh, was someone that, I know Brandy and asked her, I didn't know what she was gonna do or what she was gonna say. That was all up to her. Brandy, would you like to say anything about the role play? I think they'd like to hear from your standpoint too. 

00:41:35
BRANDY No. I mean, it was, uh, I've done a number of role plays with you in my life and it was, each time, it's just an odyssey of really getting insight into that person and being able to grow with the, a different way of thinking and a different way of looking at the situation. 

00:41:55
DR. GLASSER (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:41:55
BRANDY And a different way of looking at options and choices. 

00:42:00
DR. GLASSER Okay. 

00:42:00
BRANDY And I felt her just change and merge and come, just go down a different road. It was lovely. 

00:42:05
DR. GLASSER We, we teach, of course, the Choice Theory and, and I'd say that the most effective and most important part of our teaching is the role playing and people are always playing the role. Playing it with each other, playing it with me, playing it with the other instructors. I mean, because let's face it. When we're born, we're committed to playing a role and, you know, there's sometimes, I've never met one. Well, I met one once, uh, people with multiple, multiple personalities. They, they, they sometimes take on several roles. I just had one once. That's all and I said to her right off the bat, 'cuz she was ready to tell me about all the roles. I said look, you're only paying for one. You only get one and, and she said, she said, I understand, I'll never bother you with that again. So she may have kept her roles with other people but with me, the one role was sufficient. I mean, there's a lot of funny things that happen as you go through this life and when you're a counselor, you run into an awful lot of 'em. So... 

00:43:25
BRANDY But role playing a client really, the practice role play is in the training and the way, in Glasser Institute actually, has been so enriching. It is a different role of being empathic. 

00:43:35
DR. GLASSER Yeah. 

00:43:35
BRANDY It's a different way of kind of understanding what it must be like to be a client. I'm a psychologist. I, I, I'm secure in my role. I enjoy it. I'm a helping person but the, the practice in the, it's, it's a, it's a very interesting experience to be a client and to practice being the client. 

00:43:55
DR. GLASSER We were very lucky. Uh, Carlene, my wife, who's here but doesn't get up this early. Carlene, Carlene is a missile that takes a long time to get off the launching pad so you have to be, you have to be very careful. 

00:44:10
BRANDY Yes, but when she does, she's a mighty force. 

00:44:15
DR. GLASSER When she does, she's looking good. So anyway, she lived all her life in Cincinnati and I moved to Cincinnati and lived with her for a year while we, we turned a school there around together 'cuz she's a school person and then when she had to move here, I was well aware that she had to find some friends here and in, in, in no time at all, she found Brandy. I don't even know how she found you but all the sudden here was Brandy and, and it's been a marvelous friendship and I'm very friendly with, with Brandy's husband Bruce, who is one of the really, I, I hate to say this, but Bruce is the smartest person in the world. He's got two or three brains up there. It's unbelievable and, and so we really enjoy each other's company, so. And that's what life is all about. It's relationships and good relationships and sharing yourself through, Bruce knows the Choice Theory backwards and forwards so, uh, I mean, you don't have to tell Bruce a long time before he picks it up. He's what you call a quick study. So what we'd like to do now perhaps, we still have a good 20 minutes or so and if, I don't know if those microphones are in this room. So if someone wants to go to one of the microphones and... 

00:45:35
BRANDY They only have about five minutes. 

00:45:40
DR. GLASSER Oh. 

00:45:40
BRANDY They have a break. We only have this one hour. 

00:45:40
DR. GLASSER Oh, I thought. Okay. Well, maybe my watch is wrong. Oh. Oh, that's right. This is not till 9:20. That's the next time. So I apologize for that and go to your next hour and we'll be in... 

00:45:55
BRANDY There's two questions. 

00:45:55
DR. GLASSER Two questions. All right. 

00:46:00
BRANDY There's two questions here. 

00:46:00
DR. GLASSER We'll hold for two questions. Two questions and then walk fast to wherever you're going. Go ahead. Yes. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Can you hear me? 

00:46:05
DR. GLASSER Yes. 

00:46:10
BRANDY No. We'll repeat your question. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN It seems to me that the title of these (inaudible ) is not being, is not being, like, really, (inaudible ). 

00:46:26

00:47:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:47:25
DR. GLASSER I, I don't know if it's an anti-pharmecutical conference but I'm certainly, I'm certainly anti-pharmecutical. 

00:47:35
