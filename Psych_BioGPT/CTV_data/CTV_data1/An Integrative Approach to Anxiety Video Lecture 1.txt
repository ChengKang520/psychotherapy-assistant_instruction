CLIVE JONES (inaudible) today we're going to be looking at particularly not just anxiety we're looking at uh… an integrating integrated design. Integration means more than simply drawing from different therapeutic schools of thought in terms of technique. Integration means combining the underlying theories into a more comprehensive whole and understanding of what anxiety is, and those things that lead to it and (inaudible) taking an integrated approach to an understanding and treatment of all anxiety. We're actually drawing from a broad range of theoretical approaches to gain better understanding, a more comprehensive understanding of what anxiety is, uh… how results are the causes, and then also how to treat it in the… in the counseling process. So integration is the first thing that we're looking at with anxiety. The second thing we're looking at in… in order to get an understanding of how to bring those theories together into one (inaudible) into one integrated (inaudible). In regard to anxiety, we look at developmental trajectory. Developmental trajectory is a term used to describe the… the ideology, and the… the… the life course development of a particular issue, mental health issue, whether that be anxiety or anything else will happen again and so the ideological development over time, with all of the factors within a person's life that contribute to the resulting emotional state of anxiety. Just one other thing we need to clarify what I'm talking about anxiety, we're talking about anxiety on a continuum of degree. And then at one point we draw a line, where we say, okay, that's a disorder. Now, where that line is drawn, is debatable, but when we're looking at the emotional state of anxiety, it is a continuum with varying degrees. And at some point along that continuum, we might start to change the terminology and call it generalized anxiety disorder, or we might call it a phobia, or panic attacks, depending on where it lies on intensity and degree. We'll get back now to, uh… the whole concept of developmental trajectory. There's… there's two general themes in regard to how things like anxiety can develop over time. The first theme or concept is multi finality. Now, what finality, uh… is where one experience has the potential of multiple or range of different end results. Okay, so we had one experience that can lead to a range of different results. So for example, one or two experience of a car accident, could end up having a lot of different results at the end of it in terms of level, intensity, and type of anxiety, or other issues of concern as well in regard to depression, or a whole range of other possibilities, so one event, a range of different results. That's multi finality. The next is, umm… equity finality, equity final, what that means is that there's one particular outcome, but it comes from a broad range of possibilities. And this means, for example, somebody may end up having a state of anxiety, feeling anxious, having a phobia, umm… experiencing panic attacks. Now, that is the single result. But there could potentially be a range of possible reasons for that singular end result that we're seeing in the person and that, that person is experiencing. That term is equity finality, okay, where one final result from a number of different causes. When we start to look at the ideology over the development of particular things like anxiety, in this light, we start to realize (inaudible) there's a lot of different things that could contribute to, uh… the cause of anxiety. If there's a lot of things potentially contributing to the way we might be feeling at any stage in regard to intensity of anxiety, if there's a lot of different causes, then that has to have us reconsider how we work with somebody with anxiety. If there are a number of causes, if there are a number of potential causes to the outcome of anxiety, then in treatment, and counseling, we really need to be looking at all of those potential causes and determining with a client, what areas need to be worked through and worked on. Otherwise, the treatment will not be effective. We're looking at about 73% of (inaudible), psycho therapists that would consider themselves to be integration. What that means is that we're looking at the majority of counselors and psycho therapists, in their treatment practice considering broad ranges of issues and concerns, and trying to pull together a broader understanding of how we function as individuals in order to get an accurate understanding of the true causes of anxiety and other issues. So what we're going to be looking at is, is an integrated model of personality, which in turn will help us understand the integrated causes and Treatment possibilities in regard to anxiety. So what I'm going to do now is, uh… I'm going to use the board and draw up a diagram that explains the whole concept of what it means to have an integrated approach. And then we're going to (inaudible), we know that diagram and see how that applies to be the… the ideology, and potential treatment possibilities uh… with anxiety. 

00:06:10
An Integrated View of Personality 

00:06:15
CLIVE JONES Uh… For (inaudible), look at here is, uh… uh… the diagram that I've put together that aims to give, uh… uh….a picture of the integrated personality, and all of the variables that come together to influence our current state of being over time. Okay, so when we're looking at the variables and influencing our current state of (inaudible), we get an understanding of those things that are going to contribute to a state of anxiety, whether that be again, any form of anxiety, whether it's generalized anxiety, phobias, panic attacks, uh… those sorts of things. So we're looking at the integrated personality in those variables that are going to influence the development of something like anxiety. I'm going to draw here to start with a circle that represents the person. Okay, so what we have here is the person and within the core, and the center of the person, there are certain things that have been researched and reviewed, uh… in… in terms of those things that impact our (inaudible). Now just put them here, and so at the core, or the essence, we have biology. We also have genetics. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:45
CLIVE JONES And we also have the intra personal. 

00:07:50
[sil.] 

00:08:00
CLIVE JONES The biology, the genetics, and the interpersonal, all of these factors would be defined as something that is deeply within, uh… the personality of an individual. Now we're going to be looking at these factors, and how they can potentially contribute to the onset and development of anxiety. Still, with inside the person, we've got three other factors that have researched the book that quite specifically in regard to development over time, and what represents the personality, we have cognition. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
CLIVE JONES We have emotions. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:50
CLIVE JONES And we have behaviors. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:00
CLIVE JONES Okay, all of these factors, uh… within a person's character, personality. All of these factors, uh… playing a part in our development. Now well being an emotional state, okay. So all of these factors contribute to a state of anxiety. One thing that's very important that I've got a drone in here is the reciprocal relationship between all of these factors. So in other words, reciprocal, meaning that they all influence each other, and they all play on each other in terms of affecting who we are, and how we are at any given point in time. And so with these arrows, that I'm drawing it now they represent the reciprocal relationship of every element within ourselves is a lot of arrows, showing how everything influences everything else, is not one factor. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
CLIVE JONES That's not being influenced by something else, is not one factor that's not being influenced by something else. So when somebody knocks on the door, sits down in the counseling room, and says, I'm feeling anxious, like I'm feeling scared, by that worried, you know, about certain things, all of these factors are contributing in some way to that current state. And so being able to, uh… untangle that in order to discover what are the causes, you can see it's a little bit complicated in… in that sense. (inaudible), these are the internal factors, we also have the external factors and I'll put them up now, as well. We had the interpersonal… 

00:11:05
[sil.] 

00:11:10
CLIVE JONES Now the interpersonal, are those personal relationships between significant others, where the intra personal is the personal relationship you have with yourself within the context of an understanding of who you are feelings about yourself, uh… a whole lot of things that we will get into later, but the with each other, meaning the inside personal aspects of relationship with self, and the interpersonal, meaning, uh… the close significant other relationships, that a person may have. And you can see the interconnection there, then we also have the broader and social cultural influences, which are very significant in (inaudible) real significant. So we have broader… 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
CLIVE JONES …Social and cultural. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:20
CLIVE JONES The broader, social and cultural areas have gotten a… a significant focus over the last 15 years. Umm… Counseling has started to realize, particularly in the last 15 years, the important impact of broader social, cultural, and political influences on a person's development and state of well being. And so in this context, and in the research that's been done in this area, we're starting to get a clearer understanding of what those broader elements can have on how we feel, which in turn gives us a clear understanding of how anxiety is developed in the context of these forms of influences, broader, social and cultural, political influences, okay? And then we also have a existential or spiritual dimension, as well to development. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
CLIVE JONES Existential, spiritual. Okay, now, in this area here, the existential and spiritual, this is looking at things that are far more intangible in the context of human existence, it's looking at, uh… qualities of… of greater purpose and meaning, it's looking at, uh… aspects of faith, umm… and all of those broader elements that are, uh… far more intangible and less, uh… quantifiable in influence on human nature and development, the existential, and the spiritual elements of concern, again, (inaudible) greater research, particularly in the context of once understanding broader, social, cultural areas, and then realizing the various spiritual dimensions of each culture and bringing that into place in terms of how that influences our development and growth. Ultimately, when we're looking at anxiety, and when we have somebody sitting in the counseling room, and we're talking through, working through issues of anxiety, we really need to have a head around this stuff, we really need to have an understanding that, that the factors contributing to a person's state that anxiety, could well and truly involve a broad range of all of these things. So we need to integrate an understanding of these factors. The aim is not to just favor bias in one of these factors, not simply just (inaudible), cognitions, or behavior, or emotions, or cultural or existential concerns. It's… it's about integrating these things into a coherent whole, so that counseling treatment and practice can be far more effective in working with issues like anxiety. And so now what we're going to do is zero in on these areas. And we're going to talk about how each of these areas can contribute and influence a person's state of anxiety.

Biological and Genetic Foundations 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
CLIVE JONES Okay, now, what we're going to do is zero in on parts of the diagram, we have just presented. And first of all, we're going to zero in on that box, umm… that is deeply within the individual's personality. And in that box, we had the biology and the genetics and the intra personal, so we're going to focus on the biology first. Anxiety and biology, uh… they certainly go together very specifically, uh… in terms of the biological response of anxiety, you could say that it is a stress response, meaning that, umm… it is a physical and biological response to certain stresses. Now, again, the biology of, uh… stress response is on a continuum of intensity and degree. So even when we wake up in the morning, there's going to be a biological response, that is at the lower end, called, umm… what would be considered an anxiety response. Okay, but what it does, it divides the body to move, it activates the body to action. And that's the biological response with anxiety. But it is a, uh… fairly intense response, when it starts to show concern for the individual, the biological response, when somebody is feeling anxious, or scared, or in panic, the biological response is very, very strong, and the person can feel very, very significantly. And so this brings about a whole lot of other concerns, and worry in regard to those biological sensations that happen as a result of anxiety. The other thing is that I might wake up on a sleepy Sunday morning, and that activated stress, biological response, could be something that just allows me to open up my eyes, start my breathing, to move a little bit quicker, my heart will start to just pick up a little bit from its sleep state, uh… if I wasn't having any nightmares, it would be picking up if I had nightmares, and I'd be in a, uh… struggle, biological response. But if I've had a nice sleeping night and waking up very, umm… calmly, then I'm going to have a biological stress response that will be quite comfortable and get me out of bed. If on the other hand, uh… I've woken up by something crashing, if I stack the plates on the sink and they've slipped off, while I've been sound asleep, and it crashes on the floor, that I'm going to wake up with a very significantly stronger biological sensation. With a heart will be palpitating quite quickly, when my breathing rate will be quite high, my eyes will dilate, and I will be preparing for very strong action biologically, uh… and so we… we have to think well, do, you know, what… what causes that… that biological response and… and it is a, it's a reaction to something that needs to be done. When we get into anxiety, what's the difference between a normal stress response and a more severe, anxious biological stress response? And it's to do with threat, the more threatened an organism feels, the stronger their biological responses going to be. And so we're looking at the biological reaction that relates to anxiety is a biological response to a perceived threat. Now, when we say perceived threat straight away, we're moving into the influence of cognition. And so we're going to get into that later. But for now, what I'm doing is… is really compartmentalizing each component to talk about it on its own. But as you will find out, each of these things are reciprocal and influence each other. But for now, we're looking at the concept of threat, which results in a very strong biological reaction. Now, the thing is, is that that biological reaction does have some genetic connection as well, in that there are some fee responses that have around even before birth, that a mum can feel with a baby kicking inside. And so we… we have, uh… what an inbuilt safety mechanism, genetically, that has us responding in a certain biological way to threats. This can be, uh… tested, even with a, uh… simple startle response from… from infants and… and babies, where you might allow (inaudible) like a (inaudible) now that might have given you a startle response as well. And that's a biological reaction that comes from a genetic disposition within us. So again, you can see the connection between the biology and now the genes as well. So we have this innate inbuilt genetic factor, which has us responding biologically, to threats or anything that has to activate our bodies into some form of action. When we're talking about innate activities, then we're talking about coming from the genetic makeup of who we are. I'm going to move into the genetics now, uh… in… in regard to that, to… to start seeing the influence of genetics on this biological response, it's fair enough to say that… that, umm… different people are going to have different degrees of that innate biological reaction, you may get some people who will respond with a great level of biological intensity than others, towards different stress responses. And, and this has shown through significantly in regard to, umm… infant studies and so forth, even in regard to alarm reactions of sudden noises, uh… how quickly does, does a baby react? How strongly is their reaction? How long does the reaction… reaction last until it starts to ease off, and there is tendencies to have genetic dispositions in regard to those factors, where some babies will just naturally have more a intense response than others, some babies will have a longer response than others. And some may just take a… a lot of the time to come down, uh… where others want this calm down very, very quickly. So they are these genetic fundamental factors, as well that… that come into play on… on the biological in a reaction to the stress. Now, these factors are only part of the puzzle. And a person is not trapped by their genetics or their biology. There are other factors that come into play that are going to influence so, umm… much how person ends up feeling in the context of their environment in a situation, and how intense the anxiety is going to be. So we've got the biology and the genetics, which is there. And with the genetics, there's research that examines, uh… the percentage or influence of genetic factors in regard to the cause of genetics. And as a percentage of play in the actual cause and effect of things like anxiety, I'd like to actually… actually zero in on that, because it's been a lot of study on schizophrenia, I'm just taking little slight issue here, in regard to schizophrenia, because that is considered a major genetic factor, there seems to be a major genetic factor that people talk about in regard to schizophrenia. Now, research on that has shown that even with something like schizophrenia, there's only a 40% genetic influence on whether or not somebody will end up manifesting the symptoms of schizophrenia. Anxiety has a far lower percentage of genetic influence in regard to that, okay. Schizophrenia is probably one of the largest mental health issues that demonstrates a genetic influence. And that's only at 40%, which means there is 60% of other factors at play, other than the genetics. So in regard to that, if somebody is facing anxiety, and if somebody is experiencing panic attacks, well, then we don't write that person often say, well, (inaudible), that's nothing you just have to learn to live with, you know, you're genetically inclined to get anxious, okay, there are far more influential factors in there. The fact is that in our genes, we all, uh… going to respond to perceived threats in a certain way that will activate the biology, it will activate the biology and the more threatened, the situation might seen or, the more threatening, then the more intense the biology is going to kick in, the stress hormones are going to get quite strong. And the implications of that can be quite significant over time. And so we're looking here at the biology and the genetics. And now we're going to go into the intra personal because one factor in regard to this, we say that it's a threat. Now, there are some genetic in it (inaudible) concepts that we have a thread in, which are to a loud noise, no one teaches babies that are loud noise is something to be frightened on. And yet, most babies when they hear a loud noise, they're going to just inherently, uh… emulate at stress response and an anxious fear response. And so it's something within the genes that seems to come through that connection. But it's not just about any night concept of threat, that causes anxiety, we also have what's considered a perceived threat. And it starts to bring in other areas, our perception of threat, what it is, we judge and evaluate has been threatening. We've got the innate level, whereby in our genes, we already have some concepts of fundamental threat. Another aspect of… of that which, uh… which a baby starts to develop a concept of his death, okay, a baby will show cautionary I'm dead at a certain age, understanding the concept of falling off and hurting themselves, okay. What happens here, though, is that there's a learning process that actually starts to kick in, where we start to learn what factors might be stressful and threatening, and what factors aside. And this is where the large chunk of what starts to cause anxiety and kicks in. Regard to look at the interpersonal verse, uh… some people would call the interpersonal when it's very, very deep, the unconscious, others would call it the, the background of our mind, uh… particularly (inaudible) therapist would call it the background of their mind, so called dynamic therapists would call it the unconscious, okay. But it's that, and then we have behaviors that would say that it is that part where there is conditioning going on, where there is a conditioning is… is… is a form of learning that we're not necessarily aware of, where we're, we start to pick up cues in our environment in an unconscious or, uh… not really at the forefront of our mind way where we start to perceive what might or might not be threatening, and then we start to react to that. Now, the thing is, is that, umm… with… when we're looking at the perceived threat, we need to first of all look at the fact that might be in an unconscious, intra personal level, which means that we won't necessarily be aware that we're learning or being conditioned to perceive something as a threat. And this can become very confusing for someone that's feeling anxious, because it's not uncommon to hear someone that's experiencing panic attacks or… or feeling anxious, and saying I don't know why. I don't know what causes me to feel this way. It's not some necessarily in a conscious awareness. And so what we're looking at here is the… the unconscious in the background, intro, psychic or intra personal, conditioned elements of learning, what is a threat and what is not a threat. And it's difficult to tease that out because if a person doesn't know what they're thinking is a threat and if these things have been conditioned, or work in some way, at a… at an unconscious level, well, then it… it makes it difficult for the person to really understand what they're feeling anxious about why. And this can become very confusing. Now, we're going to now have a look at a number of different theorists that look at the intra personal, and some of the ideas around those unconscious, uh… variables that people might face that could encourage a state of anxiety to learning or feeling or getting a perception of threat, uh… within the interests (inaudible) personality. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
CLIVE JONES Okay, so to summarize, what were looking at, in regard to these three areas within the box, the broad concept of an integrated view personality with in that box, we first here got the biological reaction to threat, which would be a… a major part of anxiety in terms of what a person will feel in a physical reaction when they're feeling anxious. Okay. That's the biological reaction to threat it is very real. And it's something that… that an individual will experience. Then we also have the genetic foundations, the genetic foundations that were born with, that has us able to have that often and very much, often healthy response to (inaudible) became where we are activated to deal with the threat that is concerning us, that is warranting our body to be activated to deal with it in some way there are those genetic foundations towards the baseline database, whereby we are born with some concept of threat and a biological level, the genetics and the biology is looking in. And then we also have the interrupt personal considerations, whereby there's this unconscious, at the back of the mind, for the conditioning or learning, which starts to take place where we start to review our world and add to the database information that we start to perceive as being threatening and warranting and activated response. So this is what's going on within that box that now personality in terms of how anxiety is developing over time. So now we're going to zero in very specifically on this interpersonal consideration. And what's going on inside us what's the intrapersonal relationship, the relationship with yourself, how could that potentially end up working into, uh… uh… (inaudible) for a biological response of anxiety, uh… where we start to feel threatened and worried, anxious, and all the sensations that can come with even fear and panic, what's going on, within us at an interpersonal level that could possibly encourage or lead to a state of anxiety, we're going to look at that next.

Intrapersonal Influence on Anxiety 

00:31:45
[sil.] 

00:31:50
CLIVE JONES Okay, now we're going to zero in on that interest, psychical, intrapersonal influence on anxiety. Start to unravel some of the things that… that may contribute at an interpersonal level. Freud, we can't, uh… really look at this area without first looking at Freud, he really focused very specifically on anxiety, and, umm… he considered it, uh… a major cause of mental (inaudible) in society. And he considered that a major part of the, umm… causes of anxiety were at the interpersonal interest psychic level. The way he viewed it was that it was a very deep, uh… basement, which was difficult to get to, umm… now, you know, there's… there's certainly been a lot of development in the areas of Freud's thoughts since he introduced all of his ideas, (inaudible). But there are some aspects of Freud's work, which still stands quite true today, in a very significant life, there are hundreds of thousands of psychoanalytic around the world, that testified to the, uh… great effects of, umm… you know, key aspects of Freud's theories in regard to dealing with anxiety and other issues. So we…we really do have to look at in, uh… Freud considered interpersonal dialogue, he called, uh… the interpersonal components of… of personality that were in dialogue, and that could start to cause a person to feel threatened, we had the when he called it and divided it up into bending it, the ego, and the super ego. Now, you know, for want to better phrases, the point, the main point that Freud was getting at was that there are that there are conflicts within self, at a deep level that we will often fall from Freud's perspective, we would usually not aware of those conflicts. And so at this intrapsychic level, we will feel threatened, and therefore feel anxious, but not necessarily have any clear understanding why. And so the whole concept of psychoanalysis was to encourage the person to be as animated and as self conscious free as possible, so that those deeper aspects of who they were, could start to surface and then a greater clarity of what was causing the anxiety get the interpersonal level could be understood. Alright, so we're looking at a conflict between (inaudible) the ego, and the super ego, in terms of, uh… this conflict, just to get an understanding of that, what, what Freud talked about in regard to the id, he considered id, that part of our deep, deep personality, uh… that we weren't really consciously aware of. And he concluded and consider that it was dark, and that it was immature, and that it was selfishly driven. Now, in that concept, when we look at, umm… how he came to derive to that conclusion, he looked at two basic instincts. Now he considered it to have a biological base or genetic place. Now, again, that's open to debate, obviously. But the bottom line was that at the intrapsychic level, Freud would say that there were these basic instincts that when we did become aware of them, we were threatened by them, we felt ashamed of them. We were deeply concerned about them, if ever, we were confronted with the dark recesses of our sense of self. Freud, uh… was very close to, uh… World War, and in coming to try to understand what motivated human behavior to the cell aggressive towards each other, he, he came to the conclusion that there is within us basic, uh… aggressive drive, uh… death drive, to just be destructive, uh… to be very inconsiderate of others, and when he would suggest that if ever that surfaced in us, uh… we would feel anxious over and we'd be concerned over. But that's the (inaudible), uh… it's that part of who we are, that we might not like. That's what Freud was getting. There are other theorists that have built on that, since then, particularly in the humanistic and… and… and the Neo Freudian, or post Freudian, thought that it that concept is developed two aspects of self that we don't like. Uh… And we'll get into that a little bit more later. But the (inaudible) is this, umm… part of ourselves that's dark that we consider ugly when we see it. Umm… It can scare us, he can frighten us, it's something that we get worried about the crude, (inaudible) and… and control us. Now, in regard to the (inaudible) we also have what Freud called the other aspect within our interpersonal, and that is the super ego, that's on the other end. Now, the (inaudible) cricket, the little conscience that's, uh… communicating to us boundaries of rock and roll, that's the super ego. Now, he would suggest that that is developed in the context of society. And he saw the super ego developing very specifically in the context of our personal relationships with significant others. The other super ego development, uh… was something whereby we internalize the beliefs and values of society, the beliefs and values of various institutions that were involved in, whether that was a school, or Boy Scouts, or wherever we might have been involved in, in our childhood. And obviously, to the family system and structure, uh… where we developed a moral conscience is what Freud would call the super ego. So there's the super ego, this sense of moral right and wrong. Now, it's, he would say that it is subjectively developed, it doesn't come from an inherent (inaudible) understanding of right and wrong, but it's something that's learned in the context of our society and connections. And so concepts of right and wrong would vary from individual to individual, depending on the family upbringing, depending on the… the laws and (inaudible) that were taught in society, that's a security (inaudible), then you've got the (inaudible), that part that we just say, who cares let just, it feels good, do it. Uh… So the pleasure principle, and the aggression principle, at the youth level, then there's the super ego level, saying, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, that's not socially acceptable to do that, we can't do that here, now is not the right time or the right place. And so what happens is, is that eventually, we grow in our super ego. Now, they are in conflict, Freud would say, and as we grow up, we learn social etiquette and boundaries to what behaviors are acceptable, and what are not, for example, a young one year old, quite comfortably, will go to the toilet wherever they want to. And Freud would say that's… that's part of the pleasure principle, in just seeking the pleasure… pleasure of release, and he went into calling it an erogenous zone as well, where there was particular sexually linked pleasures. And there's a lot of debate and argument over that, but that actually deviates away from his major concept, in regard to what I'm wanting to get out here. Uh… And I want to clear the issue with… with that controversial aspect of Freud's ideas. But what we can talk about in regard to what I believe is relevant is that Freud would suggest that at very young age, our (inaudible) is far more allowed to free reign, where we can just go to the toilet where we want, where we just cry when we want more scream where we want when we're little babies, and there's no sense of external control, but then we eventually learn, it's not appropriate to be in the kitchen, it's not appropriate to scream and carry on in the supermarket. So this seeking of selfish pleasure starts to get in control, and the super ego starts to build. Now, the anxiety, that Freud, suggests, that is when the… the conflict between the super ego and the (inaudible) starts to feel out of control, where there's an imbalance with one or the other. Yeah, this brings in the third aspect of what Freud called the ego. And the ego is that part of the personality that we're very conscious of, and the ego is trying to arbitrate between the id and the super ego, the things that… that Freud would say, in a very basic level we want and selfishly desire, and at another level, at the super ego level, where we're looking at moral constraints and social rights and wrongs in order to get what we want, okay, and so he's looking at… at the… the concept of these two coming in, in conflict and the ego trying to get some sort of balance between the two. What he talked about in regard to anxiety was that there would be what he called the erotic anxiety, when the person felt the (inaudible) was taking over. When a person felt that they were losing control of themselves, where they felt that they, umm… were their desires and urges, were going to take them out over, and they weren't going to be able to control them. That's where Freud suggested that there was, umm… an erotic anxiety. And then he called, uh… when the super ego was thought to be taken out and the… the ego was concerned that the super ego was getting dominance, then that would encourage a moral anxiety. This sense of… of shame, umm… and… and a moral concern out of a sense of self. And so we've got these two levels of anxiety here. But like to give a case example of… of how this could fit in the concept of anxiety. One client that… that I was working with, umm… came to me with manifestations of generalized anxiety disorder, uh… panic attacks, without agoraphobia and also some other general obsessive compulsive factors coming in as well diagnosed and… and clearly being medicated in those areas. Uh… She came referred to me to seek further help psychotherapeutically. And so what came to (inaudible) was, umm… if I'm going to put this in Freud's terms was that she was suffering from severe neurotic anxiety through, uh… what would we call her id impulses to do harm to her young children. She was… she presented this someone who was wouldn't hurt a fly, she presented in terms of the dominated super ego, she was very sweet and nice and very friendly, and yet raging within her deep, deep within was this fearsome worry, she was so anxious next game, that she was going to have a job. This was because she had this anger and rage coming from the (inaudible) she was tired, she (inaudible) support it. There was so much going on that was having a feeling stressed and down. And then there was a small standard coming in, you cannot have those feelings, that is wrong. You won't be able to deal with it. That's inappropriate. You're a bad person. Okay, so there was this conflict raging within here, it actually manifest in a dream. The thing that scared her and frightened her the most, which she just couldn't escape from was this reoccurring dream, whereby she was harming her children very significantly. And she said that there was, umm… very graphic, there was a lot of blood, there was a lot of noise in the way that she was having a children. Okay. And so was I dealing with a psychopath. Now, I was just dealing with a mom, who was spinning out over the responsibilities of her children. And we, as we spoke, she understood that, umm… she started to realize that her ego strength could be developed so that she would be able to deal with those flashing thoughts and flashing impulses that would (inaudible), but like to share, yep. Okay, so the treatment there or… or it's about developing ego, strength, a sense of self, a sense of being able to deal with and make choices about, you know, what is appropriate, and what is not. The anxiety was very real. And it was very strong. And it was very debilitating for them. And so as we work through those deeper impulses of aggression and anger towards the children, and as she came to face and deal with the times where she was stressed and tired, and didn't wanna be with him, felt like choking them in a homer simpson sort of way, uh… you know, actually came to terms with that and learn to deal with and control those things, umm… he started to feel safer within herself. And the anxiety started to be significantly actually moved off the medication. Okay, somebody who had similar id manifestations that had a stronger ego to deal with it. Umm… Another month, she had a week of a sick baby block nose, temperature, she had to wake up every couple of hours to, uh… make sure that the baby was okay. Because if the temperature got too high, the baby would (inaudible) and… and (inaudible) was just something that the baby, so she had to look out for the bumps. Seven Days of monitoring and temperature kept it to a safe level in just crowbars, those sorts of things. But she was getting really, really tired and get up and angry and frustrated, she was at the end of the (inaudible) and there was a strong drive to just get rid of that baby. And the thing is, is that what happened was, there was one time, after about seven days of sleepless nights, she woke up to the baby crying, and she gets stoned down the stairs, she just looked over the corner of the baby, he had a flashing thoughts just picking up the baby and throwing against the wall. That didn't create anxiety in her, because she knew that it was a flashing thought in the (inaudible) of the moment. And she felt incomplete control and not letting that happen. Now, the fact is, we all have flashing thoughts that that can go through at different times. And Freud called those fleeting thoughts, manifestations of the that were coming from the subconscious, okay, and so this… this mum, had a healthy ego whereby the ego felt in control of the (inaudible) where the ego was able to say no, I'm not gonna do that, I'm not gonna pick it up and throw it even though it was a flashing thoughts floor, and a very strong, aggressive flashing thoughts. Okay, and so she was able to work through her general level of stress in a different way, because the stress level wasn't turning into a significant threat for her and so it didn't manifest into a chronic form of anxiety. Okay, this is just one example of the concept of the intrapsychic, or the intrapersonal things that go on and happen within individuals that might be facing anxiety. How we work with that, in the counseling room, that's something that we will focus on a little bit later. But I'd like to, uh… look at other areas of the larger integrated model, because it's not just about Freud, it's not just about the interpersonal conflicts, there are other things have (inaudible) which we also need to look at.

CLIVE JONES Okay, so what we just looked at is the, umm… an element of the intrapersonal and we going to be touching on that when we do look at other things, because again, there is a (inaudible) in other theories and they do move across each other in different ways. Umm… When, in a… in a sense theorists draw from each other, umm… no one ever builds a theory in a vacuum, it's always interconnected. And so all the theories relating to psychotherapy and counseling and the development of issues within somebody's personality, uh… are… are really basing it on an understanding of each other's ideas, and… and spinning from that into other concepts. Uh… And the idea (inaudible) is not to think that it's moving away, but rather it's adding to and developing a umm… umm… more comprehensive understanding of what makes us tick, as…as humans and what can have us feeling in… in certain ways really negative, in certain ways. So we just have looked at this area here in the box, I'll just quickly look at these areas here very quickly. And we'll keep returning to these here, because as you can see here in the middle, and they're being influenced by a whole range of things quite directly, whereas other things have indirect links. But you can see they are all linked. But these things, the thoughts or cognitions the things are motions and behaviors, they all, uh… are getting the direct influence of all of the areas. And so just touch on that for a little while to see how these areas can to some degree influence these areas as well. When a person is… is experiencing the biology, when a person is experiencing their genetic disposition, in regard to their biology, and when a person is also experiencing that intrapersonal conflict that could cause, uh… and… and modify the biological reactions, uh… then the person will think about that in a certain way, the person going to reach certain conclusions and beliefs and develop a certain attitude and perspective towards what's going on in here. And that's a part of the competitive process that goes on, a person will evaluate all of this stuff and the person will evaluate the biological sensations, the person is going to think about how it feels wiser heart, palpitating why we got (inaudible) hands all the love of biological and physical symptoms of anxiety, a person will start to think about come to conclusions about, okay, and in the context of that… that's going to make that person feel a certain way, which in turn will have them behave in a certain way. Again, we can have the link coming in from here, for example, a person in their reaction might have a startled behavioral response, again, for (inaudible), there can be a physical response of the jump, and straight away with going behavior that's manifesting in excellent. Okay, uh… one example of a Vietnam War veteran who would have this… what he thought was an uncontrollable behavioral response to, uh… the noise of the helicopter. Umm… On the beach, when the, uh… helicopter, the helicopter patrolling the beach and the sharks the… the rescue helicopter would fly by occasionally, particularly on a busy summer day. And when (inaudible) heard him (inaudible) an uncontrollable urge to just dive down onto the ground and protect himself from the threat of the helicopter. And now, that was because he had perception that developed in regard to, uh… helicopters from being at Vietnam helicopters met (inaudible) death. And so for him, uh… he had this behavioral response, a biological response, he had a cognitive perception and certain emotions towards the… the helicopter, okay, he… he was conditioned to… to believe that helicopters are dangerous. He learned that helicopters were (inaudible). And he had to really start to make these links, umm… in order to get some sort of understanding, you know, of why sitting on the beach being okay, and helicopter flies by he has a panic attack hits the deck and umm… everyone's looking at him thinking that he's lost his mind. Okay. And so we're in the (inaudible) compressive (inaudible) holistically we started get an understanding of that anxiety, panic, the response, all right that's joining the link today. In a… in a brief way, what I gonna zero in now is the interpersonal, (inaudible) focus on… on that next. Some theories and some ideas about interpersonal relationships and connections and how that can influence and encourage the state of anxiety, generalized phobias, panic attacks and other things we'll be looking at that next.
