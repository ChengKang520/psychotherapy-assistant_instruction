AIPC Presents Counselling Therapies Session 3: Behaviour Therapy 

00:00:20
WENDY Well, that's the housekeeping finished with Kathleen. So, perhaps you'd like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today. 

00:00:25
KATHLEEN Well actually, uh, Wendy, I'm having a little bit of trouble coping with, with my job. Um, the, the hours I'm working are, are supposed to be 8:30 to 3:30, and lately I've just got so much work given to me. I, I'm having difficulty getting through the whole day with it and, um, I've got a couple of teenage boys that I pick up after school everyday because they're so naughty, they're not allowed to go on the bus and, and so, I've made my hours 8:30 to 3:30. So, I give them a chance to, to get out of school. And, then at 3:30, I'm, I'm supposed to be there to pick them up, but lately it's been later and later. I'm getting there sometimes 4:30. The other day it was five, and the boys were just uhh. Like, they're such, they're, they're naughty boys. You know this. And, and they're, they're everywhere. They're all over the school. They're getting into trouble, and then, and then I'm late home preparing dinner for my husband and then, he gets annoyed, and on it goes. And it's all getting too much. It's, I don't know. 

00:01:30
WENDY (crosstalk) Okay. You're supposed to finish at 3:30? 

00:01:30
KATHLEEN I am. 

00:01:30
identifying problem 

00:01:30
WENDY Those are the hours you report to. 

00:01:30
KATHLEEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:01:30
WENDY Why do you think you're not finishing at 3:30, Kathleen? 

00:01:35
KATHLEEN I've got too much work. Uh, the work... 

00:01:35
WENDY (crosstalk) And who's giving you the work? What's happening? 

00:01:40
KATHLEEN Well, the, the, one doctor, I work in a doctor's surgery. I don't know if I mentioned that. One doctor employed me, but there are four within the practice. 

00:01:50
WENDY I see. 

00:01:50
KATHLEEN And I'm, I'm doing work for all of them when really I should be only doing work for one. 

00:01:55
WENDY (crosstalk) Right. Right. So, so, that's really the problem. 

00:02:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:02:00
WENDY That there are four people giving you work, and it, there's no way you can fit it into the times that you are employed to work. 

00:02:00
KATHLEEN No, and, and I, I, I just can't say no to them. They put the, they put the work into my in-tray. And, and then, and then, it's not getting to my out-tray. 

00:02:10
WENDY Right. 

00:02:15
KATHLEEN And the day goes by and it's there the next day. 

00:02:20
WENDY (crosstalk) All right. 

00:02:20
KATHLEEN It, it's, it's just all too much for me. 

00:02:20
WENDY Yes, I can see that and I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. 

00:02:25
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:02:25
WENDY So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this Kathleen? Is there anything that you think you can do? 

00:02:30
negotiating goal 

00:02:35
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Um, well, apart from just, I, I, I don't want to leave. It's such a good job but I'll probably, I'll have to, I'll have to tell someone. I'm gonna have to tell her. I think I'm gonna have to tell her. 

00:02:45
WENDY (crosstalk) Right, no, no, no. So you, you really, you do feel that you need to talk to the, the boss that employed you and explain what the problem is? Good. 

00:02:50
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:02:50
WENDY Is this something you feel comfortable about doing Kathleen? 

00:02:50
KATHLEEN No. No. No, I don't. 

00:02:55
WENDY Why not? 

00:02:55
KATHLEEN Well, she's so busy, and, and, and, and she's so lovely. And I, I just don't, I don't, I don't want to annoy her. 

00:03:00
WENDY Okay, but you said that she was lovely there. 

00:03:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Because, uh... She, she is. 

00:03:05
WENDY (crosstalk) So, so you, do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her that she'd be quite receptive to listening to you? 

00:03:10
KATHLEEN Well, well, of course she would. Wouldn't she? 

00:03:15
WENDY (crosstalk) Right. Okay. What I'm gonna suggest, Kathleen, is that we do something called a role-play. And what that is is that we act out the situation whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the, the hours that you're supposed to be working. So, you'll be playing you, and I'll be playing your boss. 

00:03:35
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:03:40
WENDY Now, obviously you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that'll you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to. 

00:03:50
KATHLEEN Oh. 

00:03:55
WENDY And practice your way through a possible scenario. 

00:03:55
KATHLEEN Oh. 

00:03:55
WENDY And what this can do, Kathleen, is give you a bit more confidence about... 

00:04:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Okay. Practice when? What do you, what do you mean? 

00:04:00
WENDY Well, we're going to practice it right now. 

00:04:05
KATHLEEN Oh, okay. 

00:04:05
WENDY What we'll do is you'll be you and I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. 

00:04:10
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) All right. Oh. 

00:04:15
WENDY Let's just think about a couple of things to, to get it started. 

00:04:15
KATHLEEN So, I pretend that I'm going to be coming into her room... 

00:04:20
WENDY (crosstalk) To talk to her about what the problem is. 

00:04:20
KATHLEEN Oh. Okay. Okay. 

00:04:20
WENDY What, what do you think would be the best time of time to do it Kathleen? 

00:04:25
KATHLEEN Oh, um, time of day? Time of day? Um, uh, it's so busy, so busy during the day. Um, probably early morning might be the best. 

00:04:30
WENDY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:04:30
KATHLEEN First, first thing in the morning. 

00:04:35
WENDY (crosstalk) Good idea. That sounds like a good idea, because then you don't have to worry about it all day too. 

00:04:40
KATHLEEN That's true. That's true. 

00:04:40
WENDY Okay, so have you had any thought, got any thoughts about what you'd like to say? How you're gonna introduce it? 

00:04:45
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Um, well, um, I, I suppose I can say to her, is this a good time to talk? 

00:04:50
WENDY (crosstalk) Right. That's fantastic, because that gives her the chance, the opportunity to say well, no it isn't, Could you come back in five minutes. I'm awfully sorry. 

00:04:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Okay. Okay. All right. 

00:04:55
WENDY Or to go straight into it. But that's a really good opening. Should we give it a try? 

00:05:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) I like it. Okay. All right. 

00:05:00
WENDY So, I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you're knocking on her door. Is that what you do? 

00:05:10
KATHLEEN Yes. Yes. 

00:05:10
WENDY All right. 

00:05:10
KATHLEEN All right. Okay. 

00:05:10
WENDY So, I want you to get up and just move out and come back in as if you're coming to see your boss. 

00:05:15
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Oh. All right. Okay. 

00:05:20
WENDY I'm your boss. 

00:05:20
KATHLEEN All right. 

00:05:20
WENDY And you're going to tell me what the problem is. 

00:05:20
KATHLEEN Okay. 

00:05:20
WENDY Okay? 

00:05:20
KATHLEEN We, we'll do the role play now? 

00:05:20
WENDY (crosstalk) Yep. (inaudible ) 

00:05:25
KATHLEEN Okay. 

00:05:25
role play 

00:05:25
WENDY Oh hi Kathleen. Good morning. 

00:05:30
KATHLEEN Good morning. Is now a good time to talk? 

00:05:30
WENDY Yeah, sure. 

00:05:30
KATHLEEN Oh good, thank you. 

00:05:35
WENDY Have a seat. 

00:05:35
KATHLEEN Oh, thanks you. 

00:05:35
WENDY What's the problem? 

00:05:35
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Um, well, the problem is Mary Ann, I'm having, I'm having problems coping with my work load at the moment. Um, mainly because it's putting me here too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on and my hours were 8:30 to 3:30? 

00:05:50
role play 

00:05:50
WENDY Yes I do. 

00:05:55
KATHLEEN Well, now I'm finishing later and later. Um, 4:30, sometimes 5. 

00:06:00
WENDY (crosstalk) Why is that, Kathleen? Why do you think that is? 

00:06:00
KATHLEEN I've got too much work. 

00:06:00
WENDY Oh, right. 

00:06:00
KATHLEEN And I like to finish on time, because I have to pick my boys up from school, and you know what they're like. 

00:06:05
WENDY (crosstalk) I know. I know. Yes. 

00:06:05
KATHLEEN So, um, I'm, I'm just wondering if, if we can work out something. 

00:06:15
WENDY (crosstalk) Well, obviously you're employed 8:30 to 3:30, Kathleen, and those are the hours we want you to work. 

00:06:15
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) I know. Yes. 

00:06:20
WENDY So, we don't want you working back. 

00:06:20
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Right. 

00:06:20
WENDY So, first and foremost it's important that you know that we want you to leave at 3:30, and that's what I want you to do. 

00:06:25
KATHLEEN Okay. 

00:06:25
WENDY But from what you're saying, the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours. Is, is that it? 

00:06:30
KATHLEEN No, no. I'm... 

00:06:30
WENDY (crosstalk) Do you know why? What's happening? 

00:06:35
KATHLEEN Yeah, I'm getting too much work from the other doctors. 

00:06:35
WENDY All right. 

00:06:40
KATHLEEN They, I, I, I don't like dubbing anyone in. 

00:06:40
WENDY (crosstalk) No, no, no. You're not. 

00:06:45
KATHLEEN But I didn't think I would be getting work of four, because there are four doctors here, and I thought I was only doing your work. 

00:06:50
WENDY (crosstalk) Right. Right. Right. I think I've got the picture. Um... 

00:06:50
KATHLEEN I don't, I don't like saying no to them though. 

00:06:55
WENDY Well, I'm glad you came to see me, Kathleen. 

00:06:55
KATHLEEN I really do need this job. 

00:06:55
WENDY Look, I'm really glad you came to see me, but obviously 8:30 to 3:30 is long enough. It's a long day. 

00:07:00
KATHLEEN It is. 

00:07:05
WENDY They're the hours you're suppose to work. So, I need to have a look into this and, and see what's going on, Kathleen. 

00:07:10
KATHLEEN It's only half my day. The other half starts when I pick my boys up. And they're so naughty. They are. They are really naughty. 

00:07:15
WENDY Well certainly, Kathleen, yes I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 3:30 everyday. 

00:07:25
KATHLEEN Okay. (inaudible ) 

00:07:30
WENDY Well, (inaudible ). How, how did that feel? 

00:07:31
KATHLEEN Well, I think because I've done that little role play, I feel a little bit better about probably going and seeing the doctor. 

00:07:35
WENDY (crosstalk) Okay. Now, obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you're going to get from, what was it, Mary Ann. 

00:07:40
KATHLEEN Well, probably will because she is, she's a lovely doctor. She's a lovely young girl. 

00:07:40
WENDY (crosstalk) Well, this is what you've said. So, there'll be something similar. The important thing is, I think, um, to work out that first opening gap there, isn't it? 

00:07:50
KATHLEEN That's true. 

00:07:50
WENDY And, and to do that and then, uh, to flow on. Um, so, that's something I want you to think about. Perhaps if you, are you going to come see me next week, in about a week perhaps? 

00:08:05
KATHLEEN Okay. But in the meantime should I practice at home or... 

00:08:10
WENDY (crosstalk) Let's look at it. What I'd like you do do is think about what we've done today, yes, but, but don't, don't over do it. Don't, sort of, keep it going through your mind. 

00:08:15
KATHLEEN I'm a bit nervous. 

00:08:20
WENDY Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit.... 

00:08:25
KATHLEEN Yeah, I don't like confrontation. I don't like telling people what to do. 

00:08:25
WENDY (crosstalk) Right, right. Right. Right. I know. Yeah. So, having the right words is a help and that will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly I think we need to relax a bit. Don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you. 

00:08:40
KATHLEEN Oh, good. 

00:08:45
WENDY Um, that I'd like you to go away and to practice. 

00:08:45
KATHLEEN Oh, all right. 

00:08:50
WENDY (crosstalk) So that by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises. Because they're things you can use anywhere, in any situation. 

00:08:55
KATHLEEN I can do them at home right? What are they? Lying on the floor? 

00:09:00
WENDY (crosstalk) Well I'll, I'll tell you what they are. But no, you don't have to lay on the floor. Not for these, because that's not very practical just before you go and see your boss. 

00:09:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Oh. No. No. 

00:09:05
agreeing on plan of action 

00:09:10
WENDY Um, so, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time. And you'll have practiced the relaxation exercises. We'll go through them again. And we'll perhaps do another role play and then we maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think? 

00:09:25
KATHLEEN Okay. That, that sounds, I feel a little bit more relaxed thinking about it actually. Thanks for that.
