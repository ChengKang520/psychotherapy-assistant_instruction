mental health academy: First to Knowledge in Mental Health

The 7 Habits of a Reasonably Helpful Counselor By Dr John Barletta 

00:00:20
JOHN BARLETTA First of all, thank Phillip and Simon and the conference committee for the invitation, their very kind invitation to do the closing keynote. Oftentimes these closing, the last session of the last day is sort of like the kiss of death, you know, trying to hold people till the, till the 11th hour. But I know you have a conference dinner tonight so you've got a second motivation. But anyway, let me just say that it's, I'm pleased that you're all staying around and bright eyed and bushy tailed. I'm not quite sure what your expectations are of this, of this afternoon. But let me just give you a little bit of a context. When I was asked if I would do this keynote, I wasn't quite sure what it is I would put together. My days, you know, it's been quite a few years since I've been out of academia. So rather than doing something which was scholarly and researched based, what I wanted to do was to do something which was a bit more reflective, or actually a lot more reflective. And so what I thought I would do is to think about what it is that I find interesting about the people that I work with, or things that I do, or things that I've learned along the way. And so what I'm going to do is I'm, when I trained in the US, they, professors used to do this thing called the "Last Lecture". I don't know if it's actually caught on here, but it's sort of like if you were to go and see somebody and they were to put together everything there is that they've done in their life, or that they've learned or they found particularly interesting in like a 60 Minutes piece. So I don't know that it's particularly caught on here, but certainly when I was in the states it was. So part of this hopefully doesn't sound too grandiose or narcissistic. I went to something on narcissism this morning and I'd hoped that I wasn't sort of like an exhibitionistic narcissist, more a closet one. And what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be sharing with you, this is my 30th year of professional work. And I didn't start off in counseling. I'm going to give you a little bit of my CV in a moment, if that might be helpful for you. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to share with you the important bits of my professional life. And rather than it being highly effective, I'd like to share with you my perception that I'm "good enough" and hence that title "of a Reasonably Helpful" one. I know Stephen Covey, you've probably worked at and appropriated the, you know, the Stephen Covey piece. And, and that's, so that's my focus. So hopefully you're, you're still happy to stay around. So why did I do, why did I put together this topic in this presentation? Because like you, I've been around the ridges, different schools, universities, different modalities, and I bring all of these to my clinical work. That's mainly what I do, I'm a clinician. And I do a lot of that without me being fully conscious of that. It's very, it's very easy to sort of slip into. I know, you know, there have been quite a few presentations of, you know, people who are encouraging mindfulness and awareness, and being in the present. And that's fantastic, but a whole lot of that is lost on me in various ways and so, I do things without completely being aware of it at times. Also, I think what I do with patients is fairly good, or good enough, for the most part and I try to be, I try to be useful in my interactions. And from the outset I'll tell you, I only work with adults, male, and particular with couples. That's an area of expertise or an area of specialty of mine, and so that's the space that I work in. So what I do there is, I mean you get a bit of sense of that along the way, but that gives you a complex anyway. And finally, what I'm interested in is not only sharing my own stuff but hopefully there's some stuff which is embedded in what it is that I present that you can do your own reflections today. Cuz when I put together this presentation I did a really, like, free association sort of piece. I just, you know, banged it all out on my computer, a whole lot of lists, a whole lot of words and phrases. And then after it I put it all together, I tried to get some subheadings there, and I actually only had six but I know that everybody has, you know, the six habits, seven habits. Also I stretched it and you can work out which is the one I was just trying to be cute with. But, see, I like to practice radical honesty. There were only six, but anyway, for today it's seven. That's the nice indulgent bit about doing the closing keynote, you can do whatever the hell you want. And what I do, I would really like it if you would, to do your own set of reflections around the personal and professional stuff in a deliberate way and share your insights with me if you're interested after today. I didn't get my presentation to Phillip or the committee, but if you're interested I'm pretty easy to, I'm pretty easy to Google-stalk. If you want my email address it is simply john@johnbarletta.com. It's about as easy as you can get, but I'm sure if you Google it you'll find me. I'm not the mass murdering in Connecticut, I'm not Ronald Reagan's secret service agent who gave his obituary, his eulogy. I'm a guy from Brisbane who has a bit of fun along the way. So if you're interested in sharing your reflections after today I'm absolutely happy to engage with you. Or if you'd like a copy of this presentation just give me a one-liner and I'll flip it to you. Okay? Alright. Happy to stay? Just trying to build up the anticipation and, alright. Just give you my CV very quickly. So, what have I done the last 30 years as Paul is talking about in the last very nice presentation. Very few of us start off in this profession and I didn't either. I started off as a teacher when I realized that, you know, as great as the 12 weeks holiday really are, and I'm not sure I was cut out to do that, but it was great training particularly for me developmentally, for me to get my head around developmental issues. Second, I spend the next five years working in school counseling, which was very nice because one of the things that, I was talking to someone at lunch today and she asked me about how it is I got to where is, to the position that I am and I actually just made something up. So, you know, you can always do this, you can always make stuff up, you know, your history. And actually what struck me was when I was in the classroom I was always more interested in consulting the parents and consulting with specialists in the school about the kids who were having difficulties. They, that, I found that much more interesting than, you know, double digit multiplication or something. I sucked at that as well, probably had dyscalculia or something, but anyway. Then what did I do is I went overseas and lived and worked there for a couple of years and became a university academic through my doctoral program, brought back a great PhD, fabulous wife, package deal, I love the Americans. And so that, so that's what I did for 14 years and I had my, what's the word for when you have that sort of "Ah-ha!" experience? Lim? I had liminal transition six years ago, this month six years ago. I was trekking in the Himalayas, had this sort of epiphany that universities could actually survive without me and much to my surprise, no, they've done just fine. And what I've done in the last six years is just practice as a clinical psychologist. I'm not the enemy, I know you're counselors and I was up until six years ago or so cuz I just realized it was prudent to get some extra credentials to be able to do some of the things I needed to do. So I'm sure you are good with your arithmetic. There's my, there are my credentials and that's what I've been doing for the last 30 years. Okay. So, whether I was a teacher, whether I was a school counselor, or an academic, and by the way while I was an academic I always maintained rooms for at least a day a week, and hence my connection with Philip for so many years. So it was always important for me to practice and as well as teach simultaneously. I felt very uncomfortable. Actually the psychology department that I worked in for 11 years, I was the only registered psychologist, I was the only person who was a member of a professional association. It was quite a strange environment to be in, and if you're interested in knowing which university that is you can Google and you can find my CV and really find out that. So you can say disparaging things about the place. But they've come a long way and they're very much in a scientists-practitioner model now, but it was very theoretical for a real long time, and I found that, I felt very, very strange to be in that place. So I've always tried to deal with my marginalization by doing things where I felt a little bit more connected. Anyway, I'll try not to ramble too much. So whether I was a teacher or an academic, or a clinician, for me it's always about being a preventer or a healer of mental health issues. Even when I was teaching, you know, year four in wherever, or year five and working in high schools, it's still about prevention. And so I guess that's my entree or my credential into this space, and I really think it's an essential role that we play, you and I play, in our culture for a whole range of not-consult sorts of reasons. So, when I was thinking about what sort of therapists, when I was thinking about what sort of therapists there may be out there, I was thinking about, you know that movie "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"? And so I've tried to do something with that idea and I think that there are, I know that there are good therapists. A good therapist means a tick in the box. So what's that? I think that's, I call them the "Therapist Magnificis", "The Outstanding" therapists. Okay? And remember my title, I did not say, you know, "Seven Habits of a Particularly Outstanding". But there are outstanding therapists out there. They're the ones who do really effective therapy and the people that they treat become fans. You know? They sort of wax lyrical about their encounters with these people, fantastic therapists and who are doing a lot of good. Next there are obviously "The Bad". They're the ones who don't get a tick in the box, they get a cross in the box, and they're the bad ones. And I think they're the "Therapist Horribillis". They're the, they are the "Appalling" ones. I'm sure it's none of you, but you probably know some people who are like that. I think we've got, no. Okay, I'll try to stay on track. They're the appalling ones, and yes there are appalling ones. Any medicine you call, you describe what they do as "Iatrogenic", that is what they do, actually, they do some harm. Okay? One of the, you know, down the right hand side I wanted to actually show that I know the moral cornerstones of ethics. So, Beneficence, Malfeasance or Maleficence, and they're the victims. And I don't say that lightly. They're the people you study in case, in civil proceedings, and out of boards and opera, and, and I think you know. They're the ones that end up on the front pages of the, in Queensland we have the Career Mail. You know, they end up on the front page for doing inappropriate things, so they actually do some damage. And then there are "The Ugly" ones, okay, because they're really good, bad, and ugly. They don't get a tick in the box, but they get a tick. That's, you know, I like to do to discriminate. And what do these ugly ones looks like? These are the "Therapist Mediocris", okay? As you can see I just, you know, I'm very well versed in Latin and I've run across this stuff. And they're the one who are sort of humdrum, okay? And the humdrum ones are the ordinary therapists and they have "customers". You know? I know you, you use the word "clients" often for the people that you treat and I don't because the majority of my referrals come from physicians. And also in terms, I like actually like something about the idea of the, well, the other model, etymology of the word "patient", in terms of people who are suffering or actually want to get some healing, so there's something that I like about that. But these are the "customers" or the "clients". It sounds like, it sounds like, you know, it's a sales piece. You know? "This is my customer base." And sure they're faithful. That is, they say, "I'll provide some therapy and I'll give you some of what it is that you're after." But it's pretty, pretty sort of ho-hum. Does that sort of make sense? Yeah. Hands up who thinks they are here?

JOHN BARLETTA Here? I gotta tell you, I, you know, I have a range of times where I have this fantasy that I'm in here. This one here is, the 2nd one here is where I hold my breath around and just hope that, dear God, I'm not in that space too often. But you know what? When you read the research, I've gotta say that I'm probably going to be in here for a certain position of the time. I know that. What else? We don't like to think that we're up there. Okay. SO what are the seven habits? Well, I'm just going to go through them really quickly. First one is about Personhood of the Therapist, that is the "being" part. Second is around what it is that we, some of our behavior in our relationships. That is, what is it we do? Third one is around the Approach of the Therapist, so the knowledge. Next is around Avoiding Idolatry and I'll flesh these out in a moment, but I just want to give you a little advanced organizer so you can actually see that I once was an educator. And, again, building up anticipation. There you go. And, also, looking at patient variables as well because we can sort of sometimes be sort of seduced into thinking it's all about us, but it ain't. Also, I've got Context and Collaboration. I think I find this one particular interesting because some of the work that I've done and some of the training that I've had, I think very systemically in a range of ways. But I'll flesh it out a little as we go along. And then finally, how to survive the drive. So just a moment.

00:14:25
JOHN BARLETTA Isn't it great to rehydrate? I was with some people that will remain nameless, Mike and Margot, and I got to have soup last night, so it's like, man. If I could setup an IV with some paracetamol, that would be fantastic. Alright, so who is this? Anybody know who this is? Who is that? It's Abraham Maslow. I'm a bit of a visual sort of guy, I like to sort of give you some idea of who these dead white men, what they looked like, and, "We must find", and what I'll do is I'll punctuate along my talk today with some quotes around some people who I find interesting, I've found interesting. "We must find out not only what psychology is but what it ought to be, or what it might be, if it could free itself from the stultifying effects of limited, pessimistic, & stingy preconceptions about human nature." And as you know, great humanist, maybe precursor to the Positive Psychology movement. And I guess that's what, I'd like to think that that's some of what it is that I'm about and that is, you now, beyond some of the stingy misconceptions. Don't you love the language of that era? Yeah. Okay, so, first of all the Personhood of the Therapist. And, look, I'm not standing here in front of you saying that I'm perfect. Perfect. Crazy, that would be a crazy thing to try to sell to you. Or the, or "Outstanding" because I don't believe that I am. But what I do went to share with you is some of what it is that I do, have done, and possibly intend to do to sort of, to be in sufficient shape to continue to be reasonably helpful. Does that make sense? Yeah. And thereby, you know, prompting some of your thoughts along the way. Okay, the first thing is that I, and, I was, I've just been tweaking this presentation this afternoon and I've been trying to, I've tried to put in some of the words that I've heard here the last couple of days. And I, and I'd like to think that I'm "well healed". That doesn't mean that, you know, financially I'm in reasonable condition. What that means, some of you use that expression, "well healed" means healthy, in some reasonable shape, have done some of the stuff to be, you know, whether it's relationally or emotionally sort of pointing in the right direction. Okay? Sort of being above the line. And so, my attempt to be well healed or having a good life, as Martin Seligman would use that term of to be well and to flourish. And for me, it's about having sufficient control and time in my life. To me, that's the, that's where the action is happening, is the control, the choice, the freedom. It was one of the great, and one of the shitty things about being a grown-up is realizing that choices have got consequences and that you actually have got control. It was great, you know, when you're a kid it's always great that you can, you know, have a whole range of excuses of why it is that you, you know, you struggle with certain things. But when you're a grown-up, that's, you know, that control piece, whether it's about choices or whether it's about what it is you choose to do with your time, is a confronting one and that's something that I've, I find useful in terms of my way forward. Now, I'm going to just share with you the, you know, for me the relationships piece is an incredibly important one. Whether it's in that internet space, or whether it's a little, you know, if we were to do that, you know, that bull's-eye model, they put you in the middle and then, you know, partner, family, friends, and that sort of piece. To me, that relationship space, I don't, you know, I don't need to sell this one too heavily to you. You know that space very well. But that's an incredibly important piece for us to attend to because I've heard it in various ways these last couple of days, that if we ain't in great, in reasonable shape, how can we be, you know, reasonably helpful for other people? And I think that's a really important one and that's something that I attend to very diligently. Also, that fun, positive space where our brain and our body are actually doing the stuff it's supposed to do with the feel good hormones. And that's around the things that we do, or the places or spaced we spend our time in so that whether it's, you know, at home or whether it's in your room, or whether it's on the weekends, that you're doing things that not only are pleasurable but also meaningful for you. And that you're not swimming against the tide. It's why, you know, I gave up working with kids and families a few years ago, cuz it was just, was over and above what it is I was willing to put in. So I actually found that space all of a sudden like in my other, my other energy, my other passions come to the floor, whereas some people say, "My God, you like working with couples? How crazy is that?" I find that fantastic. Who works with children here? Yeah, see, I think that's crazy. You guys need therapy. Who works with families? Yeah, even more crazy. You know, I've tried in doing all of that, but you know, you've gotta find what suits, what you have sufficient energy, and passion, and meaning for, and for me it's in a different space now. I know I'm, I know for the people reading "Positive Psychology" you can see what I'm doing here is I'm identifying for you those pillars of happiness, those pillars of flourishing, that we've gotta be stretched but we can't be snapped. You know? It's about keeping away from the pieces that make us anxious or bored, right? Which was where I was in the academic space, bored. And there was no stretching, and, and so that I could go on and achieve some stuff on my own terms out in the community. So, that's what it is that I've been doing for a while. This is all against the backdrop, and I'm sure you do this with your patients as well, you identify what it is that they're doing to satisfy their psychological needs, basic psychological needs. And it doesn't matter who you read, they're all going to say a similar sort of a thing, and that is, in your life, and this is what I work hard to do, is to get stability, to have some adventure along the way. Life is supposed to be fun. I don't seem like a very fun guy right now, but trust me I'm a therapist, I enjoy novelty and adventure and some pleasure, and I think that's an incredible, incredibly additive piece for our brain and our relationship development and where we can go into other territories where we are fairly whole. And finally, for me, when, and I know in a few sessions I've been in these two days, people have been talking about what is the, you know, what's the meaning or the purpose, or why is it that you do what it is that you do? And for me, it's very much, and I don't know whether I've pinched that phrase from someone else, I have no idea, but I always will use that, "to be in the service of others." To me, that makes sense to me. I don't know if that sounds grandiose, but it makes sense to make a contribution, to care, and with that knock-on effect in the community. Okay. Is there somebody complaining about me down the back? I'm Sicilian, if you'd just point them out. Okay. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
JOHN BARLETTA Okay. Getting back. It was a joke. Actually, did you realize I just made that comment against the platform of care and compassion? We'll get to the slide on paradox shortly. Okay. Can you identify who this is? We could do like a little, we could do like a little quiz now, couldn't we? Does anybody know who this is? Somebody mentioned him. Who did the narcissist talk this morning? Okay. It's Donald Winnicott, the psychoanalytic pediatrician. Okay. "A correct", I love that, I love the smoke thing. Isn't that great? Sometimes of cigarette. "A correct & well-timed", in those days it would've been called, it was called an interpretation. We just call it an intervention. So, a really "well-timed (intervention) in ... treatment, gives a sense of being held physically that is more real ... than if a real holding had taken place." It's an "Understanding" that "goes deeper." It's a nice one, isn't it? Yeah. I like it when you all make those little cooing noises, those little "mhmm" noises. Keep that up. I find that a great reinforcer, I will be here all afternoon. Physical, you know, it's so real, and so profound, and gives such a sense of containment, and I like that. So, what do I do, or, well, what is that I think that I do when I'm doing what it is that I do? Well, it's something around, obviously, it's a talking cue, that's all I've got. It's the only thing I've got. And for me the training is in the science and particularly as a psychologist in recent years it's really trying to get across the literature and around what studies tend to support. And then putting that into a form that for me would be some art. And I've, there's a couple of things that I have real passion around and one is fireworks. Again, I don't have to have a particularly Italian thing. But, cuz we invented fireworks, I don't know if you realize that. Despite what the Chinese might say about noodles and fireworks, but anyway. Yeah, see, there's always one Asian person that's like, "We did." So, where was I? That's right, it's about me right now. Okay, now. If you think about fireworks, that's pretty much science, when it's put together. When it goes off, it's pretty much art. And for me, that's a metaphor in that space for the talking cue, that it's, how is it that I'm informed about this stuff out there in the literature but, how is it that I do what it is that I do? That's the art piece. So, for me it's about trying to be myself and not play a role. I certainly did in many contexts for various reasons, but I left that stuff behind quite a while ago. So it's about when people come to me, it's because they want to come and see me because they've heard, or seen, or hope, or expect, or whatever, but I try to be as authentic as possible, and as honest as possible. In terms of disclosure space, that's a really challenging one because people will get information, just by looking at me you'll know, you'll get some stuff and you know that, you know, all of our patients Google-stalk us, so they already know some stuff about us. We don't actually have to tell them, they'll, they will read it online. Right? And just by looking they'll get other data as well. But in that, for me, in that "doing" space, how can I use myself and my experience to not satisfy my own needs, but that I think it might be additive. So how do I trickle feed as necessary things that might be helpful? But that's about using myself. And I know this piece here might seem a little bit unusual, "less neutrality/less bias". So I don't want to be that, I don't want to be completely neutral because I'm not completely neutral. I actually have a culture, and a background and a history, and preferences. So, I've got a, you know, I'm trying to get away from that, that part about being this sort of, you know, this, I don't know, this jelly-like sort of thing that just sits there and, you know, is this amorphous mess. I don't even have a language for it, it's just. But also, I've gotta be careful that I don't want to be too, I don't want to be too, project too many biases or too many, too much prejudice. And I'll talk about that specifically a little bit later. So that's about being real, because I'm not neutral and, however I don't want to be too heavy around those parts where I might have, where I do have prejudice. Also, so there's, for me, I struggle with that space between being humble and being audacious. You know, we need to have confidence but it can't be hubris. So I struggle with that space as well. The term "exaggerated optimism" is something that I've sort of appropriated from a colleague of mine, Mike Lambert, I think Matt spoke about him yesterday. Yeah. And Mike, who's probably one of the premiere researchers in outcome, outcome working therapy, always, whenever I spend time with him, we've done some stuff together, he always talks about that idea that as a therapist we have to have this exaggerated optimism. I don't know whether it's like partly being Pollyanna or whether it's, you know, optimism on steroids, but because of the nature of what it is that we do, we, I, it's, maybe the right, maybe "exaggerated" isn't the right word, but do you know what I mean by that? The expectancy stuff. Yeah. So I try to, I try to embody that along the way, and it's probably part of my personality anyway, if you hadn't noticed in the last 16 minutes or something. But also, about being curious because for me it's, in being in that curious space, that's the stuff that helps me be present rather than me going into my own head and going off thinking about what I'm going to do that afternoon, or on the weekend, or whatever. And for me it's always reminding myself, I want to be as curious as possible about this person's reality because when I do that I get absorbed into their reality. And for me that's my cognitive trick to stay focused. Otherwise, as my wife would say, I'm, you know, she knows that I have, I, you know, she has my complete attention until something shiny goes past. And, and that's what I try to do. Okay. Now, what is "no priest or police", what does that mean? Taught to me by one of my other supervisors. It means when I'm doing therapy, I'm not a priest which means I'm not moralizing. You know that, when I talked about the prejudice? Gotta be very careful because people have been judged, we're all judged in various ways, and they don't need to come to me, to me putting another overlay of this moralistic piece. The other bit, because I work with so many couples, or relationships in different forms, is that I'm, I'm not after the truth. Because we're goanna be there, you know, maybe my bank balance would probably, you know, like it in some ways. We would be there, sort of, ad infinitum trying to get to the bottom of it all. So I try and not to sort of be seduced by those other frames of moral or what the reality is, but sufficient of a shared, you know, rich description that we can work with. Okay? The, now, what I like to do is I like to, and I've always done this, when I train in a certain modality, whether it was CBT, or some Gestalt work, or some expressive therapies, or whatever, I actually take them onboard and I try to force them for a little while and that's all I do for a day, a week, a month to see what works for me. Okay? So it's goanna be contradictory what I'm goanna say later because I try to do that authenticity, but I try to do that and see whether it, see how it works and test it out and see how it works for me. And there's stuff that's sort of, that sort of works in terms of my personality because it's gotta be a reasonable integration, right? I mean, I'm not the sort of guy to be doing some, you know, some, for example, some, in, you know, you're respective expressive therapists out there, it ain't me. I'm not goanna do it. It'd be like, you know, square peg, round hole. There's a whole, you know, 40 years ago we settled the argument that for the most part, most of what it is we do can, it's fairly efficacious and we don't need to bludgeon each other over the head with, you know, some crazy modalities. It just wouldn't work for us. But what I do is I try deliberate practice, and if you ever, if you read, I've been finding something very interesting recent. I've been reading the literature on experts, and if you're interested in reading about what makes an expert, K. Anders Ericsson, as some of you probably know, is the expert on experts. And that deliberate practice is so interesting because whether you are a violinist, an ice skater, a surgeon, or now the research which has been coming out of WA, there's a young psych with a very nice PhD, the curve looks exactly the same in terms of becoming, of developing expertise. But we all, we look the same and that is if we're doing deliberate practice it means, you know, practically, you know, deliberately doing things that we suck at repeatedly with immediate clear feedback in the presence of somebody who's a mentor or a coach, that's how we get there. So whether you're doing neurosurgery or some sort of little, I don't know, a petit jet� or whatever ballerinas do, some of the, it's like, it's exactly, do you like how I just threw that petit jet� in there? It's all exactly the same stuff, it's about being an expert. If you want to get better at something, make sure you know what it is that you're trying to do and get into some sort of a loop where you're doing it repeatedly. And so, I was doing this before I even was, you know, and I'm sure you were as well, before I even read the literature. But if you're interested, that's a fascinating space. And I don't aim for this perfection, that's nuts. I treat people who are after perfection. And what I'm interested in is progress. I'm interested in the journey, somebody used the work journey yesterday, journey. When I hear the word journey at a therapist conference I think we all should, you know, hold hands and hug it out, do something like that. But it's fantastic because that's what it's about, okay? It's about being in that process. Also, a sense of humor along the way is important. Even though people have got some pretty shitty things that they come into you about, it doesn't mean you can't get some leverage in there with a bit of a sense of humor. We know it's great for our brain, we know it's great for relationships when we do the smiling thing. Sometimes we need to stick pencils in there for that, sort of, for that to sort of happen. But it doesn't matter, but if we're doing it, you had to be at the last session. We need to be provocative as well. Now, when I use the word provocative, I don't mean that in that Gestalt way, you need, you know, spitting in somebody's soup. When I use the word provocative, it comes from the Latin root, provocare, to bring somebody's voice forward, okay? And I think that's our responsibility, is for the people that we're working with, how do we bring their voice forward? How do we find what it is that they need to be exploring, you know? You know they come with, you know, this is how I present, I write it on the intake form, but how do you, how do you, you know, be part of that, that dig through that curious sort of space so that they can bring their voice forward, not the voice of their parents, or their partner, or. And also along the way, I have to be very mindful about my own regulation of emotions. And I need to do that because I want to be a bit of a model. And we know about, you know, how is it we're behaving and the impact it has on other people. So, one is, it's about containment, but two is, it's about being a model for the other person. Again, not that we're perfect because we all have experiences of marginalization, and our patients will know what some of those experiences will be, I think, without us even needing to tell them. Yeah? I'm sure people will know because, you know, coming, you know, for someone who, you know, looks a little bit different to most of you, not just some of you, but to most of you, people will know that I come from a different cultural background and they'll know that, my hunch is, they'll get a sense of, you know, whether it's delinquency, marginalization, struggle or whatever, it's embedded in that frame without you needing to really be con, yeah, consciously aware of it or even need to talk about it explicitly. Sort of? So, and then finally I don't know if in counseling you talk a lot about the big five factors of personality, but if you don't you can sort of, you can Google them. But, again, in personality theory we talk about, you know, the degree to which we are open, conscientious, extrovert, agreeable, and neurotic. And so I'm always, I think it's a bit of a nice age with some of this sort of stuff, is that always trying to be aware of how my personality might be additive, and how it might get in the way of, you know, when I'm working with people. Okay? And how I can moderate that. And a little bit of neuroticism is good. Kids, I think it is. Because for me the neuroticism is about a little bit of anxiety, a little bit of, "Am I doing okay here?" and checking that out. I wouldn't be asking the question every five minutes because that would be very neurotic, but just along the way, saying, "I really care about you and about this process. I'm goanna check out how it is that you reckon that we're going." And the reason we check out how they think we're going is, we do that because? The patient is much more reliable than us in knowing how treatment is going. If there's anybody here who still holds onto that deluded fantasy that you know how your patient is traveling and whether you are a super therapist, good luck with that because the research is, overwhelmingly says, you have very little idea. The only person who has that, who has the, well, the person who has, gotta be clear, careful with this one. The person who really has the best idea is the patient, so we have to be asking them about it. So. I don't know if this happens for you in the therapy room, it does for me sometimes, this person there saying, "Thanks so much for letting me go on. You're such a great listener." And I'm going, "On the way home: dry cleaning, bread, milk." Okay. Let's keep going. Was that just me then for a second? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yes. 

00:36:05
JOHN BARLETTA Yeah right, because you never stray, right? That's right, I've got all the, I've got all the, what is it? Therapist Magnificis in front of me, fantastic. Alright, so what are the other things that I think that I do? Well, I trust my reactions, that my reactions might also be a reflection of how other people experience that person, you know? And I think sometimes we can call some of that, I know, parallel process. But, so, how do I use that information? I had one patient who, look, I'm a pretty energetic and I can keep it up with, you know, little shots of espressos through the day, but this one patient, even just thinking about her coming would make me just, really, you know, you know this one where you're sort of like. Like that? It's never happened to me for any person before or since. Quite an incredible phenomenon. So, I didn't share that, no. And I couldn't have the kip just before she came in, that wouldn't have worked, but it's interesting stuff, isn't it? Why is it that somebody would? And we've gotta be careful too because, I'll talk about some of the positive stuff in a moment, but if I'm getting certain sorts of reactions, we'll park her for now, and please don't judge me for what I just said, how can I use that use that data back? Whether it's somebody, you know, in a marriage, or somebody with work related stuff, and how they're presenting, and what they're presenting about, and how can we use that back to them? Because, you know, what, that might be some reality testing stuff. I know this is all predicated on the belief that I'm in, I'm a reasonable barometer. Please, I, that, I haven't, you know, that's not lost to me. I did say that I thought that I was in reasonable shape, so how do I use myself tentatively with that process? Okay, "it is not necessary to be too nice to patients." They are fragile but they're also not fragile, and I think if we, I think if we want to be really liked, I'm not saying that, you know, we shouldn't care or, you know, be offensive, but I think if we are trying to be too nice, too nice and too kind, sometimes it'll stop us saying the things that need to be said or that they need to hear. And I know that sounds very paternalistic and, and grandiose, and whatever, but hopefully you'll find a way of reconstructing that which sounds really nice and erudite. Okay. "Take the risk to try something new. Go outside the comfort zone", always pushing. And you know what my profession, and I think yours, I mean, because I know that your professions comes basically from the same discipline as mine, maybe a little bit broader in, or different in some ways that, you know, there are a whole lot of psychologists who have a whole lot of neuroticism now, lot of anxiety around evidence based practices. One of my best mates is a, well, see I just said that he's a mate. Actually, no. Somebody who's in a supervision group with me is, you know, one of the premiere Gestalt therapists around. He's, and, you know, and, but has all this anxiety now because, "Can I still be doing this sort of stuff? Where's the evidence base for that?" You know, that sort of stuff? And people who have been, you know, somebody who's probably a fairly, well I believe, an outstanding sort of therapist, and he has this whole anxiety of, "Can I be doing this now?" and, "What if somebody was to audit my..." It's a crazy sort of anxiety now that psychology has developed, so, you know, maybe we'll all be coming to you with our neuroses along the way. But, also, "Collaborative responsibility", I certainly see that it's a shared responsibility. I was trained, a part of my training was, you know, it's, it's all about the, all about their responsibility, and if things were tough it was, what was the word we used when somebody wasn't doing what they were supposed to be doing in therapy? Starts with an "R". "Resistance", or "recalcitrant", I like that one as well. They're "resistant", yeah, and it was all about them rather than, "Hey, maybe I'm not, maybe I'm not doing what is most useful for this person right now? Maybe there's some shared responsibility in that?" So, whether it's about working with them or achieving goals, I certainly see that as a shared responsibility. "Always having their needs central to all I say & do." And again, the ethics talk earlier was really nice. I try to work from the idea, and I do this with my supervisees, that is, if there was a video camera, like this one here. If there was a video camera in your therapy room, would you be saying and doing what it is you're saying and doing? You know? We, we, it's like, it's like doctors. They have this mandate to ask, and look, and do a whole range of things, and as a psychologist we sort of almost can be seduced by this idea that we have a mandate to say, and ask, and go to certain territories. We've gotta be careful because are we doing it for them, or are we doing it because we might think it's titillating or interesting? Or if it's, if it's somebody who, you know, might be, somebody within the community, a bit of a profile. Now, projecting in the moment, thinking, "Oh, I'd like to know who that is they're talking about at this point because of who it is that's in front of me." It's not about me. I might find it interesting for John Barletta's sake, but could I justify it if a camera was in the room and somebody was, was looking at what it was that I was saying and doing? Make sense? It's sort of, yeah, it's like the, you know, the front page of the Career Mail test again, you know? Would I want it to be there? We need to carefully monitor our positive and negative responses. Again, that's what I was, I started to, all my talk about before. One of my earliest supervisors, when I asked him, "How would I know of the cases that I bring to supervision?" And he always said, "When you look at your appointment book, and you look down at the list, and you're going, 'oh, I'm really looking forward to seeing this person', or, 'oh, dear God, I hope this one's a no-show today', they're the ones you bring to supervision." I know it's a little bit more complex than that, I'll have a different response if somebody asks me who I think you should bring to supervision, but it's a nice one, yeah? The ones that we're particularly interested in and repulsed by. And also, I've gotta be aware that my behavior, and also their behavior, can at times be louder than words. So I need to be very mindful of what I, what I do along the way, and, again, that's really tough because I just want to be me, and respond, and, but sometimes, respond but not respond, and sometimes that might not be helpful to people. So I have to moderate that. Okay. And I think this is the final one on Behavior & Relationships. So, also, not colluding with patients behind, whether they're, you know, standing behind somebody else, or using somebody else as an excuse, or they're hiding behind their history. Really, for me, it's about trying to get people to talk about themselves, their experiences in the here and now, and what's going on even in the relationship. So try and not to collude with people who avoid. And I did a very nice workshop today. The person on writing, therapeutic writing. I don't know where she is. Oh, she just popped out. Anyway, her workshop really sucked is what I was goanna say. And I'm actually quite surprised that the committee accepted, no. She did a really, she did a really nice, she did a really nice presentation today and got us to do some writing, and said, you know, "Pick a patient we're having difficulty with and we're goanna do some self supervision." I said, "Yeah, right, as if this is goanna be useful." I started writing, and in about three sentences realized that what I had been doing with this patient, who was actually a physician, is that I had been colluding with him for an extended period of time around his own avoidance. Fantastic work, three sentences doing this therapeutic writing. So here I'm saying, "Don't collude." and realizing that I've been doing the exact same thing. What's that called? Hypocrisy. There's a Freudian term for that. Reaction formation. Thank you, thank you from the audience. Also, "What works for one person/issue, may or may not work for another similar person/issue." I actually started by saying, might, you know, probably won't, but sometimes it does. I don't know if you have those sessions. Sometimes, like, you're doing the same thing? And I'm thinking, "Oh shit, I hope this person doesn't run into the other person because I did the same diagram, or I did the same..." It's sort of like I'm coupling yourself from some of this, you know, this orthodoxy of, you know, different person, different issue. But you know what? I think I have more than one hammer, so. Alright. Also, I try to be, now this is for me, when I was writing this, I got a bit confused because I'm thinking to myself, "Was I actually writing this about patients or was I writing it about myself?" And then I realized it was obviously about both. And that is, for them, I like to be really "concrete with details." I need, give me the data, you know? So I try to be really concrete with details when people are being abstract. You know? I know you've had those sessions. In the early days I would occasionally have that session, that at the end of it, if I had to write up my notes I didn't know what the hell we were talking about. You know? You're laughing because it's, that's that laugh of knowing. You know, it's like, so I though, no. If I don't understand something, I really need to get the details concrete. I like to get as much context, and I like to look for things along the way. I actually do some forensic work, so looking for conceptual things is probably even more important in that context. But in a different way. The "Structural aspects of therapy." See, even though I'm not an academic anymore, I can still use language that gets in the way. But, yeah. About, you know, how do we, how do we time what it is that we do? When people open windows to things, do we jump, you know? Not jump out of them,, maybe go through windows and use those as opportunities. And also bridges, trying to connect things from one to the next to the next. So hopefully those, those, some of that stuff makes, makes some sense for you. And also, "I don't address every issue or discrepancy". But what I try not to do is I try not to lose them either. I try to file them away. I'm not a great note taker, but I do scrawl words, and I do some, did you, what was the word you called before? Mind map. Some of that sort of mind mapping or concept mapping thing. I don't know what I'm as clever as mind map, but I do squiggles and things and it's just the way that I think, and sometimes that pops up later. Especially when I'm stuck, I go back to the, you know, when in doubt go back. It's like when you buy a new car. Who reads the, you know, who reads the book really? 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:35
JOHN BARLETTA Mike would be the only one who reads the book. Okay, who is this? And it's a shame Paul's not here because this is who we were talking about at lunch time. It's Carl Whitaker. Probably one of the craziest therapists that ever lived. Like, literally crazy. The, and, but he, very, very, very smart guy and a great family therapist. "My theory is that all theories are bad, except for preliminary game playing with ourselves until we get the courage to give up & just live." If you haven't seen Carl do therapy, just, probably on YouTube or probably on some master series or whatever, Google him and have a look. He's, he died a few years ago, but I'm sure there's a whole lot of stuff around him, and if anybody's had an experience in family work, you'll know Carl Whitaker. Let's keep going. So, what's, some more stuff about my approach, I guess. Now, I had a, I had an old Italian lady. I, I speak Italian, I try to avoid Italian speaking patients if I can, but occasionally I get them. And one recently said to me this. She was so funny, she, cuz, you know, with my name Dr. Barletta she sort of, "Oh, dottore", you know. You know, treated me with the same sort of deference she would her physician, and she said in Italian, she said, "You know when we go to the priest in the confessional? You know, sometimes we'll lie? But when we see the doctor, you don't lie then." You know? And I thought that was so interesting, you know? Sort of like she didn't want to be judged by her, by her parish priest, but it would, it's like when you go to the doctor you've gotta show them everything, and you don't hold back. And so she knew the difference: priest you can lie to. I think she might've been Sicilian as well. But when you go to a doctor, you don't lie. Where am I going with this? It's that for her, coming to see me, even though I'm a psychologist, I'm not a, you know, I'm not a "medico", but when you come to somebody like me, you don't lie. So, it's sort of like, it's like whatever needs, whatever is happening needs to be said in that sort of, it's almost like a confessional with me. And, sometimes people will come for the catharsis just to alleviate some pain. Sometimes they actually want to, they want to get, they want to do some stuff. Sometimes it's to unburden. Who here sometimes sees patients like once or maybe twice? They come and they do their confessional thing, and then you never see them again? Who's had them? Yeah. It's that sort of idea, and so that in and of itself is some of what is that they want, fantastic, you know? And, you know, you don't have to go and stalk them. I've had some supervisees, they say, oh, you know, they had this person who came, they did this, this, this, and this, and they never came again. Do you think I should ring them? And I'm thinking, should I get a restraining order? You know, it's like, if they come, they come. If they don't come back, leave them alone. Okay, Google stalk them if you want for some reason but just, no don't do that. I was kidding. I have a pretty much a positive psychology focus. And I'd like to say that some, that comes somewhere from my culture and somewhere from my education background. I think that's where it comes from. But for me, it's really about strengths based approach. And if you guys don't use this resource already, I can really highly recommend it. There's a survey, there's a website called VIA, V-I-A. I don't know if you've heard of it. And just Google "VIA" and put "strengths" and "survey" and you'll hit their website. Why am I telling you this? Because if you talk about wanting to work with people's relative strengths, or sometimes they call character strengths, you can go to VIA, or, sorry, I get them to go to VIA if, you know, when I, you know, when we're further down the track, and I do like a 10 minute, 10 or 15 minute survey and they get a printout. Costs them zip, unless they press the button that says, "Would you like to pay for this?" and I say don't pay for it. Keep the money for our sessions, not that session. And, it's a free one and they just get their 24 character strengths printed out and they can use that. That's grist for the mill because you want to work with people's relative strengths. You got 'em and I just say, bring along the top three or five, whatever, you know? Hopefully I didn't go off-track there, but that's that, that's that positive focus. You know, if people have got a whole lot of stuff, why don't you use it? It'd be crazy not to. So let's keep going. I also work from a dual model because I am a counseling psychologist, but I also am a clinical psychologist. I see some people, like you do, with some fairly significant issues. So, the dual model is, I'm after "Health & Wellness" so I try to do the preventative stuff, but I'm also doing a whole lot of stuff around reactive, sort of, remediation. So some significant clinical stuff, so it's not just in one domain. I know sometimes counselors that say, "We do the top stuff and psychologists do the bottom stuff." No, we all do both stuff, we might be just at different points along that continuum rather than dichotomous. I also like to do time limited therapy, not the, what was the slap, you know? "Snap, out of it, get over it" sort of thing. But I, and this is the way that I was trained as well, I've gotta maximize that one session with that person because I don't know if they're coming back. And I also want to give them, and I do this, I, maybe, I don't know whether I'm, you know, maybe I do high neuroticism than I really think, but I also say along the way that if I don't, if I can't give them what it is they're after, that doesn't mean another therapist can't. Because I don't want them going away saying, "John Barletta sucks, psychologists suck, that's the end of the story." I don't mind if they say John Barletta sucks. It would be nice if they told me what it was that I wasn't giving them, or that I was giving them and they didn't want. I'd like them to tell me that, but I really want then that if I don't give them something, that they can actually go and see somebody else and know that our profession, well we know in terms of impact, we are as efficacious as any medical intervention. In terms of effect size, that's how we compare, which is really nice to know. So, and also I put this in here because somebody mentioned yesterday about the length of sessions. In psychology, we have this thing set around a 50 minute hour which comes out of the whole New York model which is a whole other interesting story. If you're interested you can buy me a beer this afternoon, I'll tell you. No, I won't, I'm be going. But for me, just to tell you, if you're interested, my sessions are usually something like about 70 minutes. My initial sessions can sometimes be up to about an hour and a half, but remember I work a lot with couples. That is very common. And I think some people fine that really liberating because everybody's, "I know, I'm 50 minute out", "I'm 55", "I'm 60", or whatever. No, I actually, most of my sessions end up being 60 minutes. Then you get billed for 50, but, well, it's how Medicare thing is setup, it's an hour session, but that's what it looks like for what that's worth. Also, I'm pretty solution oriented and I think, I'm sure you know what that is. Now, for me, I see myself more of a plumber than a philosopher. What does a plumber do? Something's broken, you roll your sleeves up, and you fix it. Okay? Sorry it sounds so, if it sounds too strategic for you. My hope is, well, I do know that I do that a lot of the holding piece in that relationship stuff as well, but for me it's about getting in there and people being very, well, reasonably clear about what it is that's brought them there. We refine that along the way, but we're not there for, we're not there for philosophy. You want to do philosophy? Find somebody else to do it, not me. Okay? What I mean by philosophy is the whys, and the wherefores', and the protracted therapeutic conversation that can go. I have a colleague of mine. He won't start seeing a patient unless they're willing to literally sign on the dotted line for two to three sessions a week for the next two to three years, because he is what sort of therapist? He's an analyst, yeah. And independently wealthy as well, yes sir. Not that there's anything wrong with high disposable income, no. Okay, let's, along the way we do "between-session activities". I think you know what that looks like, homework, bits and pieces. And again, your colleague who was here today with the therapeutic work, doing some work in between. Even if it's, even if it's only getting people to reflect on what it is that we did together. I have a clipboard in my office and sometimes people, and these people, let's call them "guys", oftentimes want to take some notes. So I have a clipboard with some paper in there, and they can just take that and write some notes as we're going along at the end of the session, and then they go and reflect on that, and they do that sort of reflection between sessions. For me, I very much have a grief and loss sort of focus, which means my prejudice is that when people come to see me that they're, they were somewhere, or they thought they were somewhere, and now they're in a different space and there's a loss. There are multiple losses there and losses need to be grieved. So that's the way, I know I'm only doing this very briefly, I'm sorry. But I think you'll get some of it. And that's the sort of frame that I have. It's my, you know, and it's one of those things, you know, as I say, "Seeing is believing." That's my prejudice so I see it all the time. You have other, you have a different sort of prejudice and you see that all the time. And at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because we know irrespective of, you know, how we see it, our frame, our intervention, we're all about, we all have about the same potential to be effective as everybody else. But I'm just telling you how I think. The other thing is, I know that this is a word that would use in medicine often, but sometimes we can cure people. Somebody has a phobia, that can be cured. I don't do much curing. I do a little bit of curing, not much. What I tend to do is a lot more healing. And sometimes for people who have a chronicity to what it is they're presenting with, in a range of ways, or around some medical issues, there will be no healing. It'll be just, it'll be a meaning making session. It'll be for them to get their head around what it means to be where it is that they are at this time in their life. Okay? So I think about that, that continuum and it helps me a lot. And I've already told you that I like to be authentic. Now, you know who that one is so I'll just put it up. It's Anthony de Mello. "If what you seek is truth, there is one thing you must have above all else. An unremitting readiness to admit you may be wrong." Now, let me get onto avoiding idolatry because I'm mindful of time, I've probably got about five minutes left so let me just do a quick race to the finish. Now, what does avoiding idolatry mean? Usually, we idolize something, we hold onto something, I think, when we can't tolerate uncertainty. We need something to keep us grounded or make us more certain, or stable, or, and I think sometimes what we can do is we can, we can hold onto gurus, researchers, theorists, supervisors, our teachers, or textbooks, and what we do is we don't trust ourselves. Please, I'm not saying, I'm not saying, you know, throw the baby out with the bathwater, I'm just saying, what I'm saying is just be careful if we hold too rigidly onto some of these people or things. Likewise, with modalities, if we hold on too tightly to some of these things we will have some missed opportunities. See, my profession has flavors of the month. And also, we have diagnoses which will be flavors of the month. As you know, years ago, I worked in, with children/adolescents, and in those, in that era was attention deficit, or, you know, Asperger's, or autistic spectrum stuff. And that was the, that was the God of at the time and then, you know, and that's what all it was about. Let's get a diagnosis. Now, now it's in a mode of major depression, or borderline, or whatever, or now, they're "highly sensitive people." You know, we have all these great names and it's just, it's reductionism. I try to de-pathologize. I know that my referrals come from the physicians, that's where the majority come from. So they've already been pathologized and, and, you know, there's been this, sort of, reductionistic labeling. And that's fine, it doesn't matter. But, you know, that's not what we meet. We meet people and we park this stuff. You know, if people hold onto it, that's fine and we honor that. But we try to take them to a different place. Sorry, I try to take them to a different place. Also, we gotta be aware of fads, trends, politics, and we get really caught up in stuff as if these are things that we need to focus on or over focus on. And also, and what is this, what, where does this take us? It takes us to "Manualized Treatment", this cookie cutter approach because we can't deal with ambiguity. You know? Give me the, give me the CBT manual and what I do in the 1st sessions, 2nd session, 3rd session, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is because we, we just can't be in that space where, you know, who knows what might happen. And then there's also the franchising of things. I just, I find all these things really interesting, but I won't, I won't belabor the point. For me, the bottom line is if we treat a person rather than a problem, well then, we can get little units. We don't have enough to buy a paradigm, we can just get little bit of units from here and there, and it's okay. I know even, yeah, there are whole lot of people who have a problem with saying they're eclectic or pragmatic and, but I'm not so sure about it.

JOHN BARLETTA "Do not depend on the hope of results ... you may have to face the fact that your work will be apparently worthless & even achieve no results at all, if not perhaps results opposite to what you expect. As you get used to this idea you start more & more to concentrate on the results, but on the value, the rightness, the truth of the work itself ... gradually you struggle less & less for an idea, & more for specific people ... in the end, it is the reality of personal relationships that saves everything." Okay, so what are the Patient Factors? Up until now it's been all about me, or about you. Now it's about patient factors. So, how do we manage individual's capacity? Well, I'm sure you would've learned in counseling school somewhere that, Stages of Client Readiness, do you remember that? Stages of Change, thank you. And, you know, we need to really be aware of, how do we motivate people, get people ready so that they can engage with what it is that we do? Other professionals do that. When you see a lawyer, a dentist, or whomever else, they prepare you for what it is about that they, what is, what it is that they're about to give you or sell you. It's the same thing here. The other piece that we have to remember is that some are refractory. That is, some people will be very difficult to change if not impossible. And you know this and I'll, it's, I had a patient a few years ago, a young woman, who came and the first thing, as she walked through the door and she introduced herself, she looked at me and said, "You're number ten." And I was her tenth therapist. My hunch is that she was probably in the refractory period or space. And that's really tough to think about because we think we can be, you know, a fair amount to most people. At the end of the day, we can't be. We're actually not helpful sometimes and there are some people who can't be helped. I think that's what the research would support. And I have to, actually, I think she did go onto number 11 in a crisis and she came back to me. Refractory means, a not a nice word would be obstinate. Yeah.

JOHN BARLETTA Now, who do we want sitting in our rooms? Don't we want these people? I love them. They can reflect on and express their experiences, they have an intact personality, they're likeable, and they have a whole lot of support in their lives, they had a whole lot of risk factors. And sometimes we get those people, but sometimes we also get people who have a whole other stress there and a whole lot of risk factors. And what I try to do is really be mindful of all of those. I think sometimes as psychologists we're very clever at getting all the, sort of, we would call the neurovegetative symptoms, actually taking a really good diagnostic history of all, how they failed and how they failed in so many ways in so many contexts. But, we're fantastic at that and then writing really expensive reports around it. But, you know, how do we understand the support and protective factors? If you come from a solution focused model or a positive psychology model, it's just the language that you speak. So, let me keep going. And along the way, obviously, the more that people are doing and the more suggestible they are, which is really a horrible word in some ways, but suggestibility is about that placebo space. That is, the expectation. You know, placebo means "I shall please", you know? People come and, you know, we can't take responsibility for them. People say, "Oh, because they like me." No, that's, that loads into another variable. People actually come with an expectation of getting better, and that's called placebo. You know that. And wouldn't it be nice if we could do this, we could actually sell it. Are you a hypochondriac who has everything but your regular placebo isn't doing the job? Talk to your doctor about a new extra strength placebo. You know? Just to get that, get that up just a little bit more. Okay. That's my comic relief along the way for me. So, who's that?

JOHN BARLETTA And I actually just checked, I follow him on Twitter, and as of five hours ago he's still alive. It's Noam Chomsky. Noam Chomsky, yeah. You're nearly there, yeah, it's one of those faces. Actually, he's really cool. On Twitter he has like about 200,000 people who follow, and he follows, like the Dali Llama, zero. How's that for ego? Anyway, let's keep going. And I love this one. "One waits in vain for psychologists to state the limits of their knowledge." Isn't that great? I love that. I love being, sometimes I get rung up by ABC radio in Brisbane and they say, "Oh, John, can you make a comment about blah, blah, blah?" And I'm going, "Oh, you know, it's sort of outside of..." and then I'll be, "Now, what time do you want me to be speaking?" I'll be", you know, it's like, "I'll make a comment on it. No, I was only kidding. I wouldn't if it was outside of my area of expertise. But we, you know, have this belief that because we know some stuff about human nature we can extrapolate and go into all these other territories. Not me, I was just teasing. It's a friend of mine who would do that. We gotta be aware that the people that we are seeing with, whether they're children or adults, they sit, and I think this was Bronfenbrenner, "sit within a context." So let me have a look at what that context looks like to explore for you. Really, if we get as much history as we can about the person and where they come from, we get to put together this veritable sort of pastiche. Isn't that a wonderful word? This pastiche, this idea of holism, this picture of various parts of where it is that people exist. We're also able to get collateral data. How do we do that? We do observations, we have psyche tests, we get results, we have letters from a range of people. And if you work with kids, I'm sure you already get some of this stuff, don't you? You get some of the teacher stuff? Yeah. As you work with adults, you usually get some of this stuff, and if need be, and I know that there was a presentation and there's some software that actually look at getting, collecting some data, psyche test, and stuff like that. They're fantastic. You know, if this stuff can be helpful, we do it. And it can be. And I use this word "consultants" because I'm one of those that when if there's somebody in my waiting room, when I go out to see a new patient or even alone, and they have somebody there, they have a sibling, a spouse, a partner, a somebody else with them, a next door neighbor, I will always ask permission, and I've yet to have one person refuse, in terms of coming into the session. And that's my family's systemic kind of background. And I always ask, first I introduce myself to them because the way that I space my appointments I don't, I have a no wait sort of policy so there's no overlap. And so when, I'll just introduce myself and bring them in, "Mum, come on in" and we'll have a yak. Even if they're only in there for 10 or 15 minutes, just gives me more data. And I think that they are so valuable. So I call them consultants because they will have some more bits. And you know what? They'll be coming back. They'll only see me for the next hour, but they will be with that other person for a lot longer. And also along the way, and I don't know if you struggle with this, but in terms of medication, I also go to that context because that's what it is that they're going back to. And I don't know if you've looked at the trends, and I know you won't believe this as a psychologist, but in the US there's some really nice data that over the last few years therapy has been declining. Okay? Therapies down, medication up. Did you get an email today from Scott Miller? Okay, research. I got an email from Scott Miller this morning and he was talking about 35% down in therapy presentation, 40% up in psychotropic medication. So, this means, you know, this is happening, so how do we explore that, how do we have a conversation? I, I, people buy into it, it's useful for some, critical for others. So, that's a part of, part of what important to them. And so I've already talked about Lambert, and Hubble-Dunk, and Miller, so you already know that what I'm talking about here is, how do we know that what it is that we're doing is reasonably effective? Well, we do that by evaluating. And there're a range of ways of doing it, and if you remember nothing else about this slide, just write down FIT. FIT means Feedback Informed Treatment, or Feedback Informed Therapy. And that's sort of like the catchall in that space about how it is that you can have your treatment, your therapy, which is informed from, informed by how you're doing in terms of the relationship and how patients are actually doing from session to session. Okay? Alright. And, and also, as was mentioned earlier today, that we need to do this sort of stuff. We don't call it "clinical supervision" anymore. In psychology it's termed "consultation" and "peer consultation" which is really nice. And, so long as we're connecting with people regularly. We usually do it something like monthly. I don't know, I think counselors are probably fairly similar. And along the way you really need to be doing all of this, the training, the reading, research, professional associations. I heard at ACA you have access to journals online. That's, I mean, that's where the action's happening and, you know, people will profit from you knowing more than it is that you do already. And finally, Charles Darwin. "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change." When I read this a few years ago, I felt so vindicated because it was like, I know I wasn't the most intelligent but I knew that I was pretty much a survivor and I, and this was really nice because this reminds us for ourselves and also for our patients, it's about adaptability. It's not about IQ, it's about that other space of personal intelligence and, and effort, and hope, and the things that we do that get them across the line. And so this is my last slide so you can start to sort of breath again. The, so how do we survive the drive? For me, that, that preservation is about being aware that we don't, that we, you know, we don't, we rust out, burn out. You know what rust out means? You don't work enough. That's about you. No. Working too much, compassion fatigue, people who work in trauma will know what compassion fatigue or vicarious traumatization is. Okay. So we've gotta be really careful about that sort of space and that's why it's so nice to hear about some people doing some really nice self-care stuff. See, when we start off as therapists we have this grand adventure which eventually turns into a fading dream. Then we move into that space of ambivalence, and we have to work at whether you're goanna hang in there or not. And if we're goanna hang in there, we need to work out ways of transcending it because you can't keep doing it. I, sorry, I can't keep doing this day in, day out. And as most people know, I only work four days a week. I don't work the Wednesday. Yes, it's a cut to my salary and, but what it means is that I can do my four days, and with full lists each day, and still be a reasonably happy chappy and in pretty good shape. But, that's my way of transcending if I, you know, if I had to do as some people do, I'd like to think I'm in reasonably good shape. If I had to do as some of my colleagues will do, nine or ten sessions back to back a day, five days, and I got one colleague who does it six days a week. Seven, I don't think it's quite, quite that much. But, yeah. What we need to do in that position as therapists is we need to be able to retreat and advance from every position we take. That means that if you're right up there and you're just giving it your all, all the time, and somebody needs you to give a little bit more, you can advance. Or if you're way back here doing zip-a-dee-doo-dah and, you know, you need to have that space to pull back and you're right up against the wall, you're not goanna have any space. You need to always be in a position where if something more is required of you, you can actually do it and if you need to step back that you can do it as well. Does that make sense? Yeah, okay. And finally, you need to "face your fact that you must grow old & die. You need to develop a sense of benign absurdity of life - thus transcend the world of experience. If we abandon missionary zeal, we have less chance of being eaten by cannibals!"
