KELLIE KIRKSEY  It's pretty amazing to be here this morning, to share this time with you because I work in the Graduate School. It's a rare opportunity for me to be among this beautiful sea of diversity that represents the undergraduates here at Malone College. So, you look fabulous and I'd like for you all to give yourselves a round of applause this morning. (applause) Early Monday morning. It's early.

KELLIE KIRKSEY  Before I move in to my lecture, I'd like to pause for prayer. (sigh) In the name of our Heavenly Father, guide us. We call on the Holy Spirit to be here with us, in this place, at this time. Dear Lord, give us sight where we cannot see, give us ears so that we may hear, and open our hearts to those that maybe different from us. Give us compassion, give us mercy and most of all let us move in life with love. This we ask through Christ our Lord, amen. This morning I'm gonna share a few words with you about cultural diversity. During our time, we're gonna talk about our Christian call to be culturally competent. If I were addressing a group in Swahili I might come up and say, "Havaragani, havaragani." If I were addressing to a group of Japanese students I might say, "Konichiwa, konichiwa." And if I were addressing to a group of Latinos I might say, "Buenas dias, bienvenido." And to you I say, "Welcome and open your heart." Embracing diversity is about embracing the human condition. It is the form in which we present as human beings, the human condition. Let's begin by defining culture. Culture is a very complex term and it's defined by the integrated pattern of human behavior that includes thought, speech, and action. It is a customer beliefs, social norms, a material traits of racial, ethnic, religions, religious or social groups. Culture also includes gender, socioeconomic status, and political affiliations just to name a few dimensions of this expensive term. In our society, multiculturalism has become a buzz word and sometimes we feel some pressure to understand all people in all ways but if we can allow the Holy Spirit to move within us, we don't have to do anything except surrender. When we talk about cultural competence, we talk about being capable of functioning effectively of cross cultures, being able to see the God, the Christ in each face that we meet on the street. In a secular world, we may decide to embrace diversity for economic reasons because it's good business but as a Christian community we're called to love thy neighbor as thy self in order to inherit internal life in the kingdom of our Lord. How do we do that? By calling on the power of the Holy Spirit. I'm originally from Cleveland and presently, I live in Youngstown but because of my work schedule I don't have an opportunity to go home and see my family often. So, I started to pray for connections because I was missing community, that sense of unity with where I come from. So, I prayed and said, "Lord, just, let me hear for some old friends. Let me just connect with some of my people from home." And I wrote that prayer in my journal and I let it go. This past weekend, I went home to Cleveland I went to go see my mom and my sisters, brought my daughter to, you know, see the grandparents. Then we decided we're gonna go shopping. A new store had opened up, Filene's Basement, you have to visit it if you get a chance. So, we're there in Filene's Basement and it's my mom and my sister and I'm just shopping go into the racks havin' a good time. And then all of a sudden, I hear some people back in the corner having a love fest. They were screaming and they were laughing and I thought, "What's going on?" So, I walked a little closer and there was my, my sister hugging these women and I thought, "Well, whom will they be?" So, I just went over to where they were and to my surprise it was three women that we had grown up with in my neighborhood back in Cleveland. I had not seen them in 32 years. It was amazing. In their family, they have four girls and in my family, there were four girls and each girl had a, a counterpart. And, uhm, the girl that was my age her name was May. And so, I ask May I said, "What have you been doing all these years? How are you?" And she said, "I'm blessed." She said, "But I just lost my husband two weeks ago. We had been married 13 years." And I just pause and I embraced her and I said, "Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry to hear that." She said, "Well, we had a beautiful 13 years. It was wonderful and I have these three amazing children." So, we exchanged numbers and we hugged again and we put our cellphone numbers, you know, in our phones and decided that we were gonna stay in touch. And I was, I was driving home, I realized that the Holy Spirit, that the Lord our God had given me the desire of my heart to reconnect with those that I had loved years ago and had lost sight of. So, when we allow space in our lives for the Holy Spirit to move, guess what? It happens. It happens. So, when we discussed diversity, you can release some of your fears because you have a Holy Spirit that's gonna guide you in the right direction. So, as Christians, we don't look at diversity as the secular world does. We put in our Christian lens and that's a higher calling. It's a challenge for all of us to get out of our comfort zone, to be little uncomfortable for Christ. In recent years, with multiculturalism and diversity becoming that popular term, citizens strive to be politically correct and that political correctness sometimes stops us from wanting to engage because we might say the wrong thing. We're not sure if we should say Asian or oriental, if we should say Black or African-American, Latino or Hispanic, White or Caucasian. What do we say? Where do we go? How do we bridge the gap? All we know is, is that we're expected to embrace this thing called diversity at all cost and it can be uncomfortable. But here at Malone, here in this Christian community, where we put Christ kingdom first were called to embrace diversity not because of who we are but because who's we are. We are the children of God. So, embracing diversity is not a mandate, no one's clubbing you over the head saying you have to do it. It is an invitation, a joyful invitation to be a soot, foot soldier for the Lord. So, walk the talk. As I was thinking about giving this presentation, I was little overwhelmed. This is something that I teach, this something that I did my dissertation on. I have volumes on this topic and I thought, "Well, I have 20 minutes, I can't really speak volumes in 20 minutes but I'll share what I can." And that's really about life in holding space in your life to reach out to people that are not like you. I met a priest a few weeks ago and I asked him what were his thoughts on, on multiculturalism. And he said, "Well, it's amazing that you would ask me that because I do presentations on immigration law and how we can help newcomers to our country." So, I said, "Well, fabulous. This guy is going to be a great resource for me." So, I said, "Well, can we have coffee? Can we meet?" He said, "Sure." And he opened up his binder and he wrote me down Tuesday at 10:00 o'clock. We're gonna meet at the coffee shop at YSU. I was really excited. So, I got up that morning, didn't have to come to work here at Malone, went to the coffee shop, got my raspberry tea, I love my tea. Sat down with my cup of tea and I waited. I kinda watch the door, checking at all the YSU students coming and going. And I watched the door and one by one there was this large table that begin to fill up. And as that table began to have all of its seats filled, I noticed that each person was another shade. It was the mosaic that I pray for, that I hope will become a part of the fabric of our country. It was this group of people seemingly different that can, had come together in this loving beyond. I mean, they were laughing, they were drinking their tea, they were ordering their salads, they were commiserating. And I just sat there and I watched them. I did. I was just watching them in amazement because I thought this is what most people need to see. This is diversity. This is embracing cultural differences. So, what I did was I said, "I'm going to step out of my comfort zone." So, I left my cup of raspberry tea and I walked over to the table and I said, "Excuse me, I hate to interrupt your party but I'm a professor at the Malone College and I was gonna be speaking to the wonderful students here at Malone about diversity. And I was struck by who you represent. I was struck by this wonderful tapestry of who you are." So, I said, "Can I ask you a few questions?" And they said, "Oh, sure, sure." So I pulled up a chair, scoots my way in, there was about six or seven of them. And I said in close and I said, " Can you tell me where you're from? Can you tell me what brought you here together in such unity and joy?" Because you don't see this everyday, I mean, I don't see it everyday, I don't. I liked to. And so, one by one they started telling me what countries they came from. There was a Palestinian, there were two women from India, there was a woman of Italian and Irish descent, there was a woman from Korea, there was a woman from Africa. They gave me their names, they gave me their languages that they spoke, they gave me their places of origin, the places that they carry in their heart. And as each one went around like saying, "This is where I'm from," the other people in the group they were like, "Oh, wow. Ooh, aah." Didn't know that. Didn't know that. They had no idea that the Palestinian who was sitting next to the, the Catholic and the, they had no idea, it did not matter because they had move from the surface level and you all know how we can stand on the surface sometimes. Sometimes we can just like sit right on the top of things and just see with our eyes and sometimes we kinda make judgments. But they hadn't sat down to the bottom, to the deeper structure where we all need to go to that deeper structure and where they came from didn't really matter. What matter was that they had a common bond that just linked them together like this. And I forge my way in there. And so, as they were oohing and aahing and say, "My goodness, I didn't know that you were from there. I didn't know that you were from there." I said, "Okay, what is it? What's the common link here?" He said, "Well, we're all first year medical students and we're scared to death." (laughs) I said, " Oh, well, was that what does it? Is that would gets us on the road to cultural diversity?" I said. "That works." That really works. Well, we can identify some commonality where we can take the time to see that there are more similarities than differences. So, I say, "Oh, yeah, we gonna laugh together, we study together, we, we sleep in one place. We just, we do this thing so that we can survive this experience. We do these things so that we can become doctors." And I said, "Well, I'm really glad because one day you might be treating me so I'm glad you study and so hard." And what I thought about was wouldn't be wonderful if we as professed Christians and how many of you here are Christians? Can I see show of hands, any Christians here? Any Christians wake up, come on. (claps) Okay, let's have a round of applause for all the Christians here. (applause) Can you clap a little louder for yourself? It's Monday, wake up. Got a whole week ahead of us. Okay, amen for the Christians. So, what I said to myself was wouldn't it be wonderful if we could come together as Christians and decide in an intentional way that we will move beyond the exterior and move into the interior and become one. United as people, as foot soldiers for Christ. What would the world be like if we could do that? What would the world be like if we could do that? Because we haven't done such a great job in embracing that thing called diversity at dealing with, with the differences. Sometimes we walk around with our basket of assumptions, am I right? Who has ever made an assumption about someone else, can you stand? I'm standing because that means me. Here in the human family me. Uh hmm. Okay. So, who here has held a stereotype, keep standing people, keep standing. Come on, keep standing. You're young, you're vibrant, keep standing. Good. Okay. Who here has held a stereotype about another group? 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN You. 

00:17:15
KELLIE KIRKSEY Yeah, I'm standing too. Me, too. Yeah. How human are we? Who here while they were driving shouted out something that was related to race culture or gender? Oh, no, none of us would admit that but it could have happened. Okay, sit back down, you're great. Sit back down. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
KELLIE KIRKSEY So, we're human, right? We are human and then our humanity, we have to allow ourselves to be uncomfortable in order to cross to the other side of the bridge, the bridge where people that don't look like us, think like us, act like us are. The people that Christ mandated us to spread the gospel to. We cannot connect with those people or minister to those people unless we allow ourselves to drop our bag of assumptions and to become vulnerable, and to feel that fear inside of us and do it anyway. We will never achieve Christ kingdom on earth if we stay in our comfortable seat sitting next to the one that we've always sat next to. Going to the places that we've always gone to. We have to do something different that is our charge to get uncomfortable for Christ and do that thing which is different. Do we do that for ourselves? Do we do that because we want a nice pat on the back. This beautiful, this is lovely, praise the Lord. No, we do that because Christ has mandated us to do that. Christ didn't have to stop on the roadside and ask the, uh, Samaritan woman for a drink of water. Did he have to do that? Of course not. Christ left that as an example for us. To cross those lines, to do the thing that most people aren't doing. To say, "Hey, I'm gonna be the one that makes a difference." So, Christ left us that example. And when Zacchaeus was hangin' up in the tree trying to get a view of Jesus and Jesus said, "Hey, come on down here I'm staying at your house tonight." Then, everybody looked around and say, "Oh, does he know who he is. He's terrible. Oh, my goodness, he is awful. Poor Jesus, should we tell him?" Jesus knew, it had all been written. Jesus knew that but Jesus said, "I'm gonna lay down this example and love the one that they say is unlovable." And that is exactly what we're called to do. So, what is your charge today students of Malone College that will be going out into the world to touch hearts and minds and spirits? What is your call today? To get uncomfortable for Christ, to do something different, to walk on the other side of the street. To greet that one that you have not greeted, to live with your humanity and with your heart. I understand that you have to go to class after this. So, I will close by reading a poem that I usually read to my counseling students as they enter into the field and began to work with people that are not quite like themselves and I'll try to read it little quickly so you won't be late for class. It's called First Thoughts. You and I, we meet a strangers each carrying a mystery within us. I cannot say who you are, I may never know you completely but I trust that you are a person in your own right possessed of beauty and value that our earth's greatest treasures. So, I make this promise to you. I will impose no identities upon you but will invite you to become yourself without shame, without fear. I will hold open a space for you in the world and allow your right to feel it with an authentic vocation and purpose. For as long as your search takes, you have my loyalty. So, students of Malone, thank you for your ears. Thank you for your heart. Please go out and make yourself uncomfortable for Christ. Okay. And when you see me say, "Hey, I'm uncomfortable I'm doing it." Thank you. (applause)
