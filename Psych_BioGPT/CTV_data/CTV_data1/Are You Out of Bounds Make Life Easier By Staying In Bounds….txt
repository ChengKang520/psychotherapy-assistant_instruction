00:01:25
PAT LOVE  So I’m going to tell you how to make your life easier. And not only easier but more fun by staying in bounds. And this is going to improve every relationship that you’re in. It’s going to improve relationships at home, at work, in the community and everywhere you go. So what are we really talking about. We’re really talking about boundaries which form acceptable limits. They’re acceptable limits but they’re also agreed upon. Now when you think about agreed upon limits, of acceptable behavior, think about these two parts of that definition. Agreed upon limits. For example, if you and I are friends, so let’s just say Chris and Gene are friends. And Chris says, if you’re a friend you only socialize when both of us are involved. Or we only do things together, for example. But Gene says, no, you know, friends are arbitrary. We can – we have many friends. So it doesn’t mean I only socialize with you. I can socialize with other people. So they haven’t agreed upon these limits of acceptable behavior. And so when you don’t have clear boundaries and they’re not agreed upon, and there aren’t these acceptable limits, then you have stress. You have distress. You have to have – you often have conflict. You even have chaos. So we’re going to talk about how to make your boundaries stronger. How to make them more clear. And this will improve every relationship that you have. Now, I’m talking about my boundaries and your boundaries. Some people have what we call loose boundaries. We have an expression of TMI, too much information. That’s the person who gives you more personal information that’s really acceptable in a relationship. Let’s just look at why boundaries exist at all. Um, first of all, they’re there for protection. If you think of the primary purpose of boundaries, just think of one word, protection. Well, what does it protect. First of all it products your safety. That white line, that yellow line down the middle of the highway, that enables us to be safe. And have cars coming at each other at high speeds and yet remain safe. Because you stay on your side, I stay on my side. So that boundary is for protection. Another is privacy. You’d have – you have privacy in your mail, in your e-mail. You have privacy – the bathroom door protects your privacy. The fence, perhaps in your neighborhood insure privacy. There’s agreed upon limits that – of acceptable behavior are really, really important in relationships. And it’s important as we work with clients and understand the nature of their relationship. This is why when you have a relationship it’s acceptable, it’s really important to know the contract or what is it that you’re expecting in relationships. Now we learn these boundaries often times early on in our families. Many of you are familiar with Salvador Minuchin’s work, structural family therapy. And he taught – taught us that in any particular family where there are children there are three important subunits in this family. And I’m going to talk about these subunits. Because I think they’re – they’re vital to understanding how we develop boundaries and where conflict can arise in relationships. So if you have children in a family, that gives us three units. The first unit is what we call the executive unit. The role of the executive unit is for adults to get adult needs met. Now, this can be a single parent family or it could have many parents in this family. But if it’s a spousal relationship, what most people are talking about when they have a partner, a love partner, a husband, a wife, a partner, is that we’re going to be some of the above here. Best friends, confidants, play mates, financial partners, social partners, somebody who’s on my side or in my corner, somebody that makes me a priority. Someone when push comes to shove is there for me. Somebody that has access to the private parts of my life that nobody else has. Somebody who has a special place. So – so if you have – or in a – a committed relationship, even a monogamous relationship, which may or may not be your contract, but whatever your contract is, whatever these acceptable agreed upon limits are, is – determines the nature of your relationship. And also how happy you are in relationship. One definition of happiness is, happiness is the ratio between what you expect and what you get. Well, if your expectations are this high and you’re getting this much, you’re not very happy. So, these acceptable and agreed upon limits that really set the boundaries of a relationship or the contract of the relationship are extremely important. You know, it’s funny because I often ask couples when I sit down with a couple, I’ll say, well what is your contract or what is your contract with each other. And – and when I ask them that, you know, they often like, look at me like – sort of like, a goat looking at new fence. You know, it’s like what – what are you talking about. What are the – what’s the acceptable behavior. I mean, is it okay to, uh, have a work spouse or someone at work with whom you have this private intimate personal relationship. Even though it may or may not be sexual. Is that okay. Maybe it is. So these expectations are all about adults getting adult needs met. Now, if you have a single parent in this family, it’s really important for this single parent to get his or her adult needs met, from other adults. This is a peer relationship. Because you still need that social contact. You need the support. You need someone who – who – with whom you socialize. Someone with whom you have adult conversation. Someone who’s on your side. Someone who’s in your corner. Attachment theory tells us we need about three to five people in our close attachment circle. We need these people. And so, even if you’re a busy parent, it’s extremely important to have your social needs met. And to be spending time, and getting support, from other adults. I – I have a line, I hear myself saying to clients very often. It goes like this, partnering is a primary part of parenting. You’ve got a partner with someone. It may or not be a primary love partner. But you need that support. Often times busy single parents say to me, well how do I – how do I do this. You know, I’m already stretched and – and stressed to the limits. How do I do this. And I say, you may have to do it together. You may have to trade off. You may have to join forces. But however you do it, adults getting adult needs met is truly the –the function of this executive unit. And this is the unit and research has been replicated years and years and years over the years showing that this is the unit that determines the health of the family. So you have to really make sure the adults are getting their adults needs met. So that’s – that’s sort of the executive unit. The second unit is the parental unit. The parental unit is about providing love, structure, protection, guidance, skill development for the children. This in a way is a – is a hierarchical unit. It’s not a peer relationship unit. It’s designed – you know, babies don’t have babies for a reason. And that is because parenting, care giving, childrearing, requires a level of maturity. As well access to resources. So there’s a reason why babies don’t have babies. Because we need that maturity. We need – because in that parental unit there is more privilege and there’s more responsibility. And children are less anxious when parents are in charge of the family. Children are less anxious – it – it actually protects them, even though they’re act like they want to be in charge. A child who’s in charge of the family is an anxious child. And research has shown this has consequences even further along even into adulthood. So this parental unit is about protective boundaries, roles, rules, regulations. The parents being in charge, it doesn’t mean children don’t have a voice. Doesn’t mean it’s not democratic at all. But the parents are in charge and parenting is separate, is different than partnering. And I think that’s really important to remember that parenting is different partnering. And yet partnering is a primary part of parenting. Because children learn more by watching how happy. Children learn more by watching how happy the adults are then by anything else you do. Number one compliant of children, parents are too stressed. Parents are too stressed. So – so this, you know, adults getting their adult needs met from other adults really helps children. The child that’s in charge is an entitled charge – and entitled child. And entitlement means this, my whims, wants and wishes are more important than anybody else’s. When the child is in charge then this becomes an entitled child. Entitlement leads to loneliness. Loneliness can need – end up in addiction, acting out behavior, etcetera, and then not – for sure not a very happy child. This third unit is the sibling unit. And this again is a peer unit. This is where kids learn social skills. They learn how to get along with other people. They get their corners rounded off. If this is an only child, they need access to peers. So that they can socialize. Have their own cohort group. And the two biggest problems in families are number one, is when the child is running the family. And parents turn – have – you know, are – are following the child’s guidance. And this child then is an anxious child who feels like my whims, wants and wishes are more important than anybody else’s. And by the way, this is a child who gets highly reactive when compliance isn’t there. And thirdly this is a child who – who really gets indignant when they’re asked to help others. Because entitlement means that everybody’s job is to make me happy. And that ends up not being a happy child as they move through life. The second problem is when adults turn to children as a best friend, a confident, a – a partner or a social partner when your whole life revolves around the kids. That sends a message that actually research shows -- shows – is determined in the child’s mind as pressure. It becomes pressure, it becomes stress. And children want parents to be less stressed. So what is the key here. The take home is, the adults in the family have to have support. You’ve got to get support from peers. Secondly, your job, my job, is to raise children who grow into their own potential and who are collaborative and cooperative. Not – the opposite of entitled by the way. And they also have compassion for other people. And thirdly this – this support that you get, it – from a partner, from a social group is a primary part of parenting. So just remember if you shore up your boundaries, healthy boundaries make healthy families. Healthy boundaries make healthy people.

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Dr. Love, thank you. 

00:14:55
PAT LOVE You’re welcome. 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Um, it was interesting – I mean, I knew you were going to be presenting on boundaries. But you talked about some things that I don’t usually hear tied to boundaries. Like, entitlement. 

00:15:05
Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:15:05
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes, I know. It’s – it’s amazing. Um, I really to go looking at this research about – because 20 years of research of build – trying to build self esteem. Now by the same researchers is considered a failure. Because we taught kids that you’re – you’re wonderful just the way you are. Everybody’s a winner. You know, I have a slide with a kid with a trophy this big. 

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:15:30
PAT LOVE And he says, look ma, we lost. And so, again, just because show – you show up, you’re a winner. When we separated behavior from character, you know, behavior from esteem, it, like – and – and we didn’t – we didn’t judge character so to speak. When we separated those with no – in other words we gave them privilege with no responsibility. So when you separated those what we built was entitlement. And entitle – this is why when you’re looking at – at how this plays out, empathy scores are down, compassion is down. And if you think about what really makes healthy relationships. And a lot of it has to do with empathy and compassion. And – and cooperation. That’s the nature of our species. 

00:16:20
SHANNON DERMER Being attuned to someone else. 

00:16:20
PAT LOVE Being – exactly. 

00:16:20
SHANNON DERMER It’s not just to what you -- 

00:16:20
PAT LOVE Exactly. Not just to me. And – and so this – when you begin to see, uh – and I – I have a lot of empathy for – for parents because there is – it is more competitive today. You know, we have a shrinking middle class. We have kids that – that now it just takes these top grades to get into school. And it’s so difficult and it’s expensive. And, you know, it’s almost – it’s – it’s pushing 300,000 dollars to raise one kid to college. Not through college. So, I think there is a lot more pressure today. And expectations. And then you have this whole cohort group. Where kids are on – you know, they get this feedback 24 seven. Which is like your personal paparazzi. You know, it’s -- 

00:17:05
SHANNON DERMER So with the -- 

00:17:05
PAT LOVE You got your own – you know, like -- 

00:17:10
SHANNON DERMER You can be your own paparazzi. You can put your picture up everywhere. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE Exactly. It’s all about me. And so, again, it – it’s not bad mouthing how – what we’re doing. It – it’s looking at what research says is – we all have to be accountable. 

00:17:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:17:25
PAT LOVE We all have to be accountable. But I love the part that the antidote is, we, as adults, we got to get a life. We’ve got to make -- 

00:17:30
SHANNON DERMER That’s true. 

00:17:30
PAT LOVE -- adulthood look like it’s worth having. 

00:17:35
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:17:35
SHANNON DERMER No – you know, what that’s interesting also. Because I think, um – and this is why I tell students, like, it’s important to do research because sometimes it goes – it often goes, it’s counterintuitive to what we think. 

00:17:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:17:45
SHANNON DERMER Like, we thought -- 

00:17:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER -- oh, we’ll support these kids. They’ll have great self esteem. But actually we took away in some ways their desire to learn by, uh – by complimenting them for things that they aren’t actually, you know, good at. So they go for the compliment instead of the love of just learning. 

00:18:00
PAT LOVE You got it. You got it. 

00:18:05
SHANNON DERMER Uh, entitlement, you know -- 

00:18:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:18:05
SHANNON DERMER Um, not learning how to deal with failure. Even though we will all fail at times. Not learning how to deal with competition in a constructive way. 

00:18:15
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:18:15
SHANNON DERMER That we do these things – and as parents we think, oh, we’ll give our total selves to our children. Our children will be happy. But we’re not teaching them how to be adults. 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE Exactly. They want the parents to be les stressed. 

00:18:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:18:25
Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE And – and you and I know, that when you’re stressed what helps is, you know, you get a friend. You – you get family, you get your support. You get relaxation. And you get – and kids get to see that. You know, what’s interesting about all the coaching and classes and tutoring and camps and all the experiences that we give our kids to try to help them get ahead, what research has shown is, kids internalize that as pressure. It’s almost like if I can, I have to. And so when kids are saying you don’t understand I’m stress – how stressful it is. I think they’re right. I think we don’t understand. And you and I both know, because you’ve had the experience, so have I that you see people on Facebook and they’re all having so much fun or, in the social media, whatever is the newest thing. Oh, look at that. They’re there and I’m not. So it looks like they’re having a better life than I am. And that – that pressure that we live with makes relationships more difficult. I think relationships are far more difficult today because expectations are higher and stressors are higher. 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER Ah, that’s a good point. And I like your – I like the takeaway of, uh, if you want to teach your kids how to have a good life get a life. 

00:19:40
PAT LOVE Get a life. Yes. Yes. 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER I like that. Um, but something else that was interesting – because I know you work with a lot of couples. So you’re talking about parenting, somewhat. But you’re also talking about the couple aspect of -- 

00:19:50
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER -- being a parent. 

00:19:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:19:55
SHANNON DERMER Is that – I think at sometimes people have a reaction to the word boundaries. They think that that -- 

00:20:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:20:00
SHANNON DERMER -- is the antithesis of intimacy. 

00:20:00
PAT LOVE You know that’s true. Because you – and – and let me just say, you – your boundaries can be too rigid. In fact one of the complaints – there’s an old, uh – uh, Peter Sellers movie. And he walks into a hotel and there’s, uh, the hotel clerk. And – and a dog there, you know. And he says to the clerk, does your dog bite. And the clerk says, no. And so he reaches over to pet, and the dog bites his hand and barks. You know and he says, I thought you said you dog didn’t bite. And he says, not my dog. You know, so -- so that’s a rigid boundary. And – and I hear these complaints all the time from –in couples. Uh, from one partner who says, you don’t give me information. I feel like I have to fight for your attention. You know, your assistant knows that the job – you know, the big grant came in. But I didn’t know. I don’t –I don’t feel special. I don’t feel included in your life. I don’t know what you’re thinking. I don’t know what you’re feeling. And so, you’re absolutely right healthy boundaries are permeable boundaries, you know. It’s not a rigid boundary. And, um – and even in the family, by the way, there are times when kids are in charge. They are the focus. They are your social life. I mean, it’s not – so this isn’t rigid. I’m glad you’re bringing this up. Because it’s not, you know, hard and rigid. Because that really does rigid families research has shown it – if they don’t do any better than, you know, those that are neglectful and have loose boundaries. 

00:21:35
SHANNON DERMER Good. So it’s, um, uh, sometimes I’ll tell my classes, you know, like if I had to summarize uh, mental health. And healthy relationships. If you could only give one word it would be, um, balance. 

00:21:50
PAT LOVE Oh. 

00:21:50
SHANNON DERMER Um, and not balance like always equal. 

00:21:50
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER But balance -- 

00:21:55
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER -- that you know – so that’s kind of what you’re talking about with boundaries. Is a balance -- 

00:21:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER -- of, um, information. Too much gives chaos and is overwhelming. 

00:22:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:22:00
SHANNON DERMER And anxiety producing. 

00:22:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER Too little you feel distant, not attuned and - 

00:22:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER -- also has to be flexible. If I got a second word it’ll be flexible. Flexible over time. And, you know, when your kids are younger you might need -- 

00:22:15
Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:22:15
PAT LOVE You’ve been reading the research. Yes. Flexibility always predicts. It’s always a part of healthy family functioning. You’re right. You got to be adaptable. You’ve got to be flexible. And to have those boundaries – because, and here’s the other thing. If you’re in a relationship, you know, could be as a love relationship. Even a friendship or – or a parenting relationship. It’s going to change developmentally. 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER Exactly. 

00:22:40
PAT LOVE So if you’re not flexible, you know if your still treating your – your, uh, 35 year old like a five year old, then there’s going to be conflict. And, uh, there’s going to push back. There’s going to be stress and distress. So, it’s a really good point that flexibility. Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:55
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:22:55
SHANNON DERMER Well, I like your point too, things, um, change. There was, um, there was a book on spiritual resources by a – from, uh, Walsh. And I don’t remember the author of the particular chapter. But he was talking about when he took his marital vows that, um, you know, that was important at that time. But he and his wife would revisit their vows over time. Because he said, the needs and responsibilities and what you want and desire changes. 

00:23:15
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:23:15
SHANNON DERMER So they would redo they vows over time. And recommit themselves and have that discussion about what is it that I kind of need now. Because -- 

00:23:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER -- you don’t stay the same over -- 

00:23:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER --- 20 or 30 year, or 40 year marriage or -- 

00:23:30
PAT LOVE My friend, Michelle Weiner Davis, uh, I heard her give a talk one time. And she said, you said – you set your New Years goals every year. You set goals for yourself. Why don’t you set goals for your marriage, for your relationship. You know, and I thought that was just a really good idea. And renew and recommit and refocus. And – and again, it – it’s like those agreed upon limits. Those agreed upon goals. Those agreed upon boundaries that let us know are we there. You know, are we keeping our commitment to one another. Yeah. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER And as the – and has what you wanted from that commitment changed over time. 

00:24:10
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER Um, maybe not some of the core fundamental things. But there’s a lot of stuff around that too. 

00:24:15
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER How do you help clients revisit their boundaries or adjust their boundaries? 

00:24:20
PAT LOVE Yeah. You know, it’s interesting, I actually have a handout. You know, I’m educator at heart even when I’m a therapist. I actually have a handout with these roles. And often times I’ll show them and – and I’ll say, what is y'alls contract, you know. And I’m from Texas I can say, y’all. 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER I heard the y’all. Yeah. 

00:24:40
Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:24:40
PAT LOVE You know. I say, what is your – your contract with each other. I mean, what are your expectations. And, this is – this is what, you know, most people say are agreed upon roles in the family. Be – and because here’s the problem. Let’s just say, you and I are a couple. And we have a child or two. But the child is – is my best friend. You know, my confidant. Uh, I’ll – most of my energy and focus and socializing goes to the child. That puts you in a really awkward position of being jealous of our own child. 

00:25:20
SHANNON DERMER That’s a good point. 

00:25:20
PAT LOVE I mean – and it – and it adds conflict between you and the child. Because that child in many ways is in your place. 

00:25:25
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:25:25
PAT LOVE And – and so, because commitment, if you – to what are we committed. So if I bring that child up as my best friend, my confidant, and – and by the way, children take advantages of their advantage. You know, they take advantage of their advantages. So they’re going to – they feel -- they – they fight to be in charge. But when they’re in charge it’s stressful. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:25:50
PAT LOVE Because in the child mind, they know if I’m in charge we’re in trouble. And – and so this – this is – if we want to make it safety – safe, because remember boundaries are more like about protection. And again, you’re – your word flexibility is important because of course, sometimes we are socializing, you’re socializing. But it’s sets up that conflict and that even jealousy. And then it makes you look – puts you in bad light because you’re jealous of your own child. How you -- 

00:26:20
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:26:20
PAT LOVE Well jealousy is your intuition telling you there’s somebody in your place, somebody in your space. So that’s a healthy sign in a way. Because – but of course, the – it’s – you have to be very mature and sophisticated to know your problem isn’t with the child. Your problem is between us. Is with me. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. That is – well that’s really interesting. Because again, I think society – and we only have a couple of minutes but I think that society really has put it, like, oh, children first, children first, children first. 

00:26:45
PAT LOVE I know. 

00:26:50
SHANNON DERMER And of course, they should be your prior – a priority. But the relationship that helps you to support parentally should be a priority. 

00:27:00
PAT LOVE Partnering is a primary part of parenting. And if – you don’t have to have a partner. But you got to have a social support. Because that takes the pressure and the stress off kids. And that’s what kids, number one complaint, they want their parents to be less stressed. 

00:27:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Yeah, and it’s funny you also point out that we often – children especially, often fight for something that instinctually they also know is problematic and is anxiety. So of course they always – it’s like, they want to eat all the candy. But they get the -- 

00:27:25
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:27:25
SHANNON DERMER -- stomach ache. It’s our job that even thought they might be fighting, they want to be your best friend. It’s partly our job -- 

00:27:30
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER -- to go, like, a little bit good. Too much gives you a stomachache. 

00:27:35
PAT LOVE You got that. You got it. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER So, yeah. But that’s – that’s hard. Especially with that pressure. And I think, you know, especially on women. Um, you know, both men and women but especially on women. But it gets back to, you mentioned, um, Menuhin parentification. 

00:27:50
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. Yes. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER That it’s not good for the child but it’s also not good for our relationship. 

00:27:55
PAT LOVE And it really makes relationships later in life more difficult. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER Oh, very good point. That yes, we’re setting that -- 

00:28:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER We only have a minute. But I do want to highlight that, that you’re saying the relationship that we have with our partner or our social -- 

00:28:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER -- others if you – if you’re not married or in a committed relationship. And the relationship that we have with our children sets them up to be either better partners and spouses later in life. And people. 

00:28:20
PAT LOVE And friends. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. 

00:28:20
SHANNON DERMER Oh, very good. Um, we’re just about out of time. But if there’s one thing you want to leave everyone with. What would it be in like 10 seconds.? 

00:28:30
PAT LOVE Yes. If you want to make your life easier, shore up your boundaries. Respect your own. And respect others. And I think good boundaries make healthy relationships. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER Just like good fences make good neighbors. 

00:28:40
PAT LOVE You got it. Robert Frost.
