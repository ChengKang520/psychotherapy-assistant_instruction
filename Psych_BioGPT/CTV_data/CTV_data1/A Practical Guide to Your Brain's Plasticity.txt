DR. MICHAEL MERZENICH Basically erase the animal's ability to ever be forward condition or condition to establish this relationship to in a stimulus award or, or, or he could do this independent of the animal's age. Strongly implying that the brain was actually changing itself physically and functionally as you engaged it. Karl Lashley did many experiments, most to the most compelling was an early experiment published in the early 1920s, in which he demonstrated. If you simply looked at the movement map in the monkey, at two different points in times separated by a significant, relatively limited period of time, they were different. And not led him to understand or to argue that in fact, you could not think of the brain as representing anything in a constant way. The fact that the maps each time were different, every time he looked with an intervening event of time must mean that those maps in fact were uh… continually changing themselves across the period of life. And then they did a whole series of experiments in which he argued that, as a function when the brain is wounded, the fact that you could recover ability, must mean the brain is remapping all of those assets it needs to control the function that accounted for its recovery. In a more modern era, people like Richard Thompson was a great professor at, at University California, Irvine and later and he ended up in Harvard. He trained a whole series of scientists that conducted very simple experiments using the Pavlovian method, so-called classical conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning demonstrating, they could change the responses of neurons in an animal of any age by, by, by, by such conditioning. One of uh… his most important sentence was Marion Diamond a, a great scientist at University of California in uh… Berkeley. One of several scientists in a Berkeley team that repeatedly demonstrated that you can, when you engage an animal, you can change its experiences. Give it an enriched environment, you actually change the brain physically and that, that applies to a brain of any age. And then the, and the still more modern era Norman Weinberger, a great professor at the University of California, Irvine, did a whole service experiments in which he witnessed the direct change of , of the, in the details of the responding of neurons as, as a consequence of classical conditioning. So the fact that the brain was continuously plastic was supported by many studies conducted across the last century. And then in the middle of the Century, beginning in the late 1950's, developmental neuroscience and the mainstream of science and medicine begin to deny these plastics, the fact of this plasticity. And it really came about from studies initially, if scientists that were, and they were the side best scientists in the world in neuroscience you could say, that studied a processes of development and they seem to witness a brain growing up, being very plastic when the brain was young and then freezing itself into a cult adult form, still in the first, and translated humans in the first year or two of life. The notion that the brain was a plastic, from that point forward every neuron had grown up, every neuron work to do from that point forward, stem from this research. And a whole series of other aspects of neuroscience is a very complicated story, seem to support that view. So the notion that the plasticity was limited at first years of life became transcendent in medicine and education. So 35, 40 years ago, almost every neurologist almost every educator was trained to believe that plasticity only occurred in the baby or in a very young child. And by the child to child came to the schoolhouse door, it was all substantially over went. And what you saw in front of you and neurologically was what you had for a life. The brain was hardwired. Every element was in a mature form and it really only had one way to go from that point forward in life and that was it, it could only deteriorate. Now actually nothing could be further from the truth. It was completely wrong. And we now know in fact that the brain is continuously plastic, plastic across life uh… uh… without interruption. Now like, like so that people of, often called me the father of plasticity, and I find it incredibly embarrassing. I find it embarrassing because in the background, people from physiological psychology like Norman Weinberger all along or Marian Diamond were saying that the brain was plastic, just that no one listened to them. And in the mainstream of medicine and science uh… they were just ignored. So undeniable evidence that the brain is continuously plastic was there all along and uh… that just like people just not paying attention to it. And in, in it, in it, it wasn't fact… substantially because, the physiological psychologists studied these issues did not study them in the terms that most scientists from the neurological side or the or the sort of hard core neuropsychological side studied these issues and I came from that side. So the main contribution actually scientists like me made was to, was to demonstrate that this applied in the strict sort of more sophisticated technical terms to, to the mainstream, how a mainstream scientists would think about these issues. So my colleagues and I helped change this perspective by showing that the brain rapidly remodels its representation of the body surfaces after profile nerve damage or central injury or stroke. So we did these experiments early on beginning in the late 1970s. By showing that the brain is remodeled, as skills or acquired or approved by training, so in this case we're conducting studies using uh… the more normal or conventional way that you think of acquiring a skill or improving a skill by training and, in this case an animal. With, with induced neurological changes obviously accounting for performance acquisitions or goals. So you can train an animal, the animal can be at better and better at something and you can look at any point in the, in the period of progression and you can see a very strong, very obvious accounting for the animals improvement of that skill or ability or the acquisition of that ability by changes that you witnessed in the brain. So in fact this led to the understanding quite rapidly, that any time you acquire a skill, it is a product of brain remodeling. So that help to people, help the people understand that the brain in fact is continuously plastic. By showing with the research of many others, how the older brain controls this remodeling. So, of course, experimental psychologists had thought for a long time about how to control improvements in training or task and these, these operational principles of control in the last 25 years have actually now been translated in neurological terms. We no longer have to guess about how the brain controls learning. We now know the processes, we know the rules. We can define them as a series of equations. We now know… we no more need to argue about how the brain is actually accomplishing this. By demonstrating that large scale experience and learning-induced changes can be easily generated, if the conditions are right at any age. So one of the first things we did, when we saw the brain was plastic on a massive scale, as we found animals as oldest that we could, monkeys long of tooth you could say. And we ask ourselves, can we do this? Can we see the same changes in a monkey or in the other life? And the answer was yes. The brain is plastic. It's, it's, it's took turns out, it's, it's big trick, as long as you're alive. It's inherent in it, it's changing itself continuously across life. By showing that every aspect of the elemental processing into the cerebral cortex, cerebral cortex is 350 million or so processing units, some of you know this, some of you don't, they're called "minicolumns" and their associates to neurons that are working together, little teams of neurons. We showed that you could change team memberships by a thousand fold by manipulating information and help processing information in the brain. They are plastic. Up to that point they were imagined to be physical constructs, inherited, developed naturally produced early in life and then frozen in place, they're not physical at all, they are neurologically generated context that are continually changing their own memberships and continually subject to competitive alteration. By showing how plasticity changes as a function of age in early life and why scientists made the mistake of believing it was all over before you showed up at school. So now we have a very clear understanding about why the mistake was made, the grand mistake which plagued us for a, a 30 or 40 years. By showing with others that plasticity is multi-dimensional, with negative changes and synaptic strengths occurring in parallel with positive changes. Now one of the most important things about plasticity that we've come to understand is that, it's bi-directional. I could take any one of you and I could destroy your ability quite easily to understand what I'm saying, by training you. I could take any one of you and, and in a period of two or three or four weeks, I could turn your hand into a useless claw by training you. Associate bi-directional, I could take any one of you and I could improve your ability to understand what I'm saying under difficult of conditions. I could take any one of you and I could prove, improve the functional use of your hand by engaging in a appropriate way to drive positive changes of performance of ability, plasticity is by- directional. And when you think about the health of anyone in front of you, we think about how things have changed in them or are changing in them. It's really important you understand plasticity not just in the positive sense, but you understand plasticity in the negative sense. By repeatedly showing that plasticity follows a "Hebbian Rule." So Hebbian, Hebb… Donald Hebb was a, a great Canadian psychologist uh… in the, in the uh… early part of the last dominant, in the early part of the uh… uh… the second half of the 20th century. And he, he, he, he incredibly intelligent perceptive individual who imagined how change processes could be accounted for and posited a great principles which later he tried to demonstrate, must apply by conducting experiments in animals, behavioral experiments on animals. The principle or the rule is, is that whatever fires together, wires together, string since in its connections. So it popped a bunch of the positive aspect of plasticity. And when we actually positives rule in a formal way I, I, I can't go into these details it's just too complicated. And what we call… competitive, competitive Hebbian network model, that pretty accurately defines what will happen in the brain as we engage the brain in training. Now put it another way. Once we know the rules that govern plasticity, we can control on it will. We know how to drive positive and negative change at will. Again I could take any one of you and I know, I know the principles that apply for driving improvement of any of your faculties. And that's really important to know when we think about controlling plasticity for human good or evil for that matter. And by showing that following this rules, it is just as easy to generate neurological resource, the degrade abilities as it is to drive changes than improve them. And by the way, human kind all over, including many of these people in the world, in this room are busy at driving their brain in a negative direction. So that's something we're going to talk about quite a bit in the next couple of hours. So we now know that brain plasticity is a basis of, every individual's creating a model of the world in their brain, they don't, you're not born with one, you generate it by your interactions with the world. And your, it's in your own special version, no one has one just like you because no one's had experience, a special history just like you. And, and then uh… this just, the same process has come for you evolving the control of your operations within that world. All of this evolves within your skull, within your lifetime. The, the level of change that accounts for it is unbelievable. Quadrillions of moments of change occur with your brain, within your brain, within your life. So sort of an unimaginable level of complexity, complex changes have occurred within your brain across your history to this point in your life that account for the person that you are operationally, everything, every skill that you've improved at, every skill that you've acquired is a product of this change. The very construct of your read… your ability to operate in continuous percepts, perceiving in, in an right complex environment like this is a product of this incredible massive individuated change. It does a fabulous thing by its complexity. It differentiate us one from another. Every one of us has a machine that's unique to us, no one has a brain just like ours. Just like your brain within your skull, no one ever will or no one ever can because of the level of the complexity of these changes that account for this for your individuation. What a gift? What a precious thing? What an amazing thing? It makes sense too that you exploited your skill to your own best advantage, because in fact, you are in a continuous work in progress. It also, it's also very, very important for those of you in help professions. They understand how to control these changes to the benefit of the people like you're trying to help obviously. Now consider this boy here that's uh… in the bottom of the picture. He's running at full speed and he's bouncing a ball on his head and he's talking, chatting to his teammates. Can you, can you guess where this boy is from? Well, he's from Sao Paulo and in Sao Paulo 40% of boys of his age can do this. And that's another way of saying that we're very much products of the culture into which we just happen to been born. All of us have massive specialization that relates to the, to the, to, to, to our moment, our place where we happen to have sprung up in a cultural environment into which we just happen to be operating in our childhood and, and in, in our life. We're massively specialized in relation to the, to the circumstances of this, of the moment and culture, the time and the evolution of culture that we have to, that we are… And I bring this up because it's really important when you think about health and the wellbeing of individuals in… in our environment. For example, in a sense dyslexia is, just as much a modern invention as is universal reading, until we demanded that every child be able to read, dyslexia was not a problem. And then as soon as we require that every child have certain abilities, as soon as we require that we're going to make all of these demands on everybody amongst us, that everybody do well in the state achievement test, we don't have failures in the state achievement tests. So how we think about our ability and how we think about how well an individual's doing is very much a function of the culture into which we've been born. Now finally, I want to point out this, this lady at the bottom right of this and we can see that I have a bunch of children and at the bottom right I have someone that's slightly older. And she's, she's uh… demonstrating that she's mastered a skill. And we know that this woman or a person of the, her age could actually have acquired this skill at an older age. And we know that she could improve that at… the ability at the skill even at this age. And we know that the acquisition or improvement of any skill is in fact direct evidence, a manifestation of brain remodeling. And that's another way of saying that this ability, this remarkable capacity to change is with us for a life, it's a lifelong resource. It's with us for a life. So our brain made both the operational person, but while it's making the operational person, it made something else really wonderful. So it accounts for all of our skills and abilities. It actually created a representation to the world we live in by building a connection, the association of the things up long together in the world. So the reason that we have a sort of coherent reconstruction of the things in front of us is the brain is powerfully capable of re-associating all of the information that's critical that goes together, that allows us to interpret what we see in front of us and to operate with stability within this kind of complex environment. But every time we have a feeling, every time we have a thought, every time we have an action, the brain builds another association. And the association is to the source of that thought or that feeling for that action. Billions and billions and billions of times, the brain is actually, can actually strengthen the relationship between those feelings and actions and thoughts to the source and the source is you. The source is a centered self. So that centered person that you are, you, that very essence of you has actually grown in your brain by this massive level of physical association with you as the source, of all of the actions that come from your brain and your body, as you identify you as embodied, because from all of the contacts on the surface of your body you come to the limits of your skin in self reference. When you think of you from the point of view what you're seeing, you put yourself right back behind the position of your eyes. The brain is actually created seven or eight of these self, self referenced entities, that's actually created the person you are operationally but it's also created this wonderful ongoing ever present creature that you call yourself. Now the self is actually built to extend its connections to other things around you that are particularly rewarding or particularly frightening to you. It's actually constructed for attachment. So because you are closely connected, let's say as a mother to, to the infant that you bare, and to that infant growing up as a child. That person actually grows into that with massive reference to you, actually grows into the person that you are as a part of yourself. That's why a mother in a sense would defend her child through the death. In a sense its self-defense and the child attached with equal powers to the mother, if all goes well. Of course all doesn't always go well. But this machinery fundamentally is built for attachment, and attachment is such a critical aspect of what we are. We have this natural power to grow are connected us to the other things around us that are positive or tragically, strongly negative forces in the, in the environments in which we happen to grow up a bit well. It's important to understand that whatever your age, given us massive potential plasticity, you, every human being is still a work in progress. You know, one of the things that's most frustrating to me is to hear somebody being told from a medical doctor for example, which is all to, something occurs all through often, but in a sense their life is done that their prospects are dim, that the chances that they can be better or stronger, that things would be better for them are limited. In fact the brain is continuously plastic and every individual alive and able to control their actions on any significant level. There's always the possibility, not just the possibility but the right sort of effort. Everyone can be stronger or better or more capable neurologically, next week as opposed to this week and a lot better, next month as opposed this month and a whole lot better next year as opposed to this year. This machinery is continuously capable of changing, in a fact improving itself or it's, it's also capable of going south. As long as we understand how to control the direction of change and move it in a positive direction, wonderful things can come from it. So the bottom-line is continuous change under the brain's own control for its own benefits is actually the brain's big trick or contrary to the notion that it's not plastic in, in, in at older ages. Understanding our human natures for it for, for education, for human welfare of medicine, this understanding that brain is continuously plastic changes everything. So it's just, just as a fantasy uh… there's a uh… there's a science fiction uh… story that I love which has it that people want to move from go from moving from their dying planet to another planet. And so they create a environment in which they know it through take too long to get to another star to another planet so they create an environment that's planet like and uh… and they get all get on this uh… on this big ship and they well, never remind us it's too complicated the story. Let's say we've all been on this rock, this big rock, earth let's try it, let's try it this way. We've been on the spring rock and of course we don't, didn't, haven't really understood ourselves we haven't really had the capability of understanding ourselves. And now 80,000 after humans first arrived here, for the first time we move past speculation and myth. To the reality of understanding our brain and how it accounts for us and in a sense what our true natures are, this is a position we're in, in 2017 from a, from an ignorance that dominated how we thought about these things from uh… from uh… from a photo mythic perspective suddenly across the last 25 or 30 years ever a relatively clear understanding of our true natures and about how we evolve our powers and about what the nature and why we after behave the way we do, to a large extent we see this now increasingly defined with clarity in terms of the rules that govern the processes of our physical brain of the instrument controlling of this within our skulls. This changes everything. It changes how we should think about ourselves, it changes how we should think about or, or educating one another, it changes how we think should think about how we lead our lives, it changes how we should think about our medicine, how we can help people be better stronger or more effective for all of those that struggle amongst us, it changes everything. So how and why this science changes everything is what we're going to talk about for the next couple hours. So first of all I just want to say that everything is plastic and we tend to think of plasticity in terms of uh… of connectional change, your think of wiring, you re-wire your brain to hear this one. That's the tip of the tip of the great big iceberg. All kinds of other things are changing besides wiring. So this is a not going to be another point of thing that we, we come through. But uh… you could say the consequences of all these changes that you can easily change the fidelity of the brain's ability to represent things of it's important for us to deal with, you can, you can easily manipulate its power. That coordination which really reflects the reliability with which the brain is operating, the complexity in which, which you can deal with… information or challenges it's immunity to noise or disruption or destroy or, or, or and all of the things that come from it. It's easy to change it's processing dynamics, it's very easy to change your brain that's sluggish and make it operate at speed in fact it's easy to take a brain that's operating speed and convert it to a sluggish brain. And you can do this at every perceptual toggled executive control and action control level process, it's all plastic. I want to just talk about uh… the compelling demonstration of plasticity uh… that that came about in my life. Uh… many years ago so when I first went to the University of California at San Francisco, umm… I became involved in a project that ultimately led to the development of a… personal version of what's called a cochlear implant, so one of the commercial cochlear implants came from a team of scientists that I led at the University of California. So we were working on development of these advices and umm… and the, the whole idea we had was that if we shocked an auditory nerve in the, in the inner ear and we could, could create a pattern of input from the air to the brain or slight the pattern normally representing sound like speech, maybe the person receiving that input could interpret that as ongoing speech. So this was a basic idea and we umm… we thought that, that the, that the accuracy of the simulation would be absolutely critical for achieving this. Not that the information from sound translated the brain in this artificial way would not be useful to a person, but we never imagined that it would be easy for us to represent speech is intelligible. Oh, we dreamed about it but we were, we were, we were skeptical. And, and one thing that made us skeptical was that, it was very difficult to control stimulation in a highly localized way in the environment of the inner ear. So remember we're shocking the nerve of ray, it's in this beautiful spiral, viral rape but we can only have access surgically to the base, basal part of this that normally represents only the highest frequency sounds. And controlling stimulation in this, you know, salient fluidic environment to, to, in a local way was very difficult. I, I analogize it to playing Chopin with your fist or maybe your forearms are very, very good. That's not so surprising in a way that when we first turn these devices on and in patients, uh… they don't like what they heard. Well, they were thrilled that they heard something. But they said those sounds like a robot sounds like somebody talking in a foreign language will never, never, never understand just sounds like a lot of noise. So we worked very, very hard to try to manipulate the way we coded this information to the, to the, so that the, the, the speech could be more intelligible uh… we tried all kinds of things with relatively limited success. And uh… five or six or seven months into this process, a patient came in to us and said, "You know, I don't know what's happening but I'm beginning to understand what, what people are saying." And then within two or three or four weeks, he understood most of what people were saying. So on we begin to see this happen as a routine thing that is to say people acquire the ability to understand what people were saying you can say within three or four or five or six or seven or eight months. In the time these devices were plugged in forget all of our machinations they begin to correctly interpret all speech with relatively high levels of accuracy. I don't know if you've ever seen anybody with a cochlear implant but this is a role most people of acquired hearing loss with a cochlear implant require speech understanding at a relatively high level. The salesman goes back and reestablishes her career on the phone, the schoolteacher goes back and reestablishes her careers in front of her class. So this is not uncommon that you see recovery on this level. So across the world there were two other groups that had very different ideas about how to encode information to represent speech is intelligible. We thought they were crazy. One group was in Austria one was in Australia. Completely different coding schemes and we thought they did not have the slightest idea what they were doing. Uh… and uh… in a sense they didn't just like we didn't because their patients had exactly the same experience. Three or four or five or six or seven or eight months after the device was first strapped on the patient heard everything. The brain didn't care whether you had one input form from the ear to the brain or second very different form of input delivered to the brain or third or a different input that brain didn't care. It have the capacity to change itself in a way in which given a new front end to this machine. It made sense of it and in every case in every population the patients said the same thing. Well, it sounds exactly like it's sounded before I lost my hearing. It's amazing. Now this is not a miracle of engineering, I know uh… I know all about the details of this engineering, these were very sophisticated device that of most sophisticated devices and that there are implanted in humans. This is a miracle of plasticity. You deliver inputs from the brain of this great sensory system. In a new form all of it coming from a completely different source than oral speech is normally represented from the lower reaches so you could say the higher frequency representational zones of the inner ear. Over a relatively remarkably short period of time the brain makes sense of it. And interpreted to reconstruct speech it cannot be interpreted that has reconstructing it in the same way on the same patterns it cannot be. And yet the brain makes us re-marvelous recovery. We realized that this was a miracle of plastic changes in the brain, changes that occurring on an unbelievable level and it did not matter how old the brain was, it could be young and it could be old, it did not matter. So our brain is actually controlling its plasticity as it develops skill after skill of the learning context. And I want to talk a little bit about these the nature of these changes that we have, here we have two beautiful little girls these are my granddaughters at a younger age. And uh… other they uh… the girl on the top is now 14 and the girl on the bottom is now 17 and uh… but here they were little, little munchkins and I have these pictures from the historical record. And you can see the little girl at the top is learning to use a tool. So she's aren't learning to use this lever with the scoop on the end. And the, the use of this tool is to, is to uh… retrieve substance that that are uh… that are the ratable, she's going to dip that that tool into that substance, so you can see she has a bowl of uh… in front of her and sometimes when you do this there's a lot of resistance to introducing the scoop and sometimes there's not much. This is not a really simple skill, it'll be very, very difficult to train a monkey to do this, this is a pretty difficult skill, pretty demanding, requires pretty squares that ability to control this tool as a function of how it's weighted when and how could be delivered into the substance and so forth. Uh… and, and uh… but it's going to be acquired it's acquired in every child just about by uh… progressive learning and practice. And what happens in the brain when you do this does your prime really driving changes in the strength of synaptic connections augmented by many non synaptic learning, learning-driven changes. So you're primarily accomplishing this by changing the strengths of connections in the brain. And those connections are reinforced as a function of whether or not they contribute to the success of each try and using the tool. Now this tool use in this particular case is a relatively simple relationship to, for the child interpreting what is successful, the first bases of interpretation is whether or not she receives achieves the goal and the goal is expressed relatively directly by a, by a reward, reward is the receiving of food to the mouth. I might say that this child has not really mastered this tool you can see by the, by the uh… by the uh… spaghetti sauce on our left hand that she still using alternate methods and you can also see that uh… by the spaghetti sauce in her leg that she's, she is not complete, a complete tool master. But she will master it, she's also holding the fulcrum of the left levered near the scoop, you always do this when you learn to use this. Using this tool with… adeptly you're going to move that fulcrum more and more up towards the, the end of the end of the rod is, that's uh… connected with the stoop. So actually these changes our modulators the function of behavioral state and behavioral contingencies, she's entered this. She wants the food and the reward. And once she gets it there she there, there's quite to be a release of "modulatory neurotransmitters" and there's a whole series of them. They're actually gonna enable to changes that occur in the brain. So when the conditions are right and the goal is achieved some of these modulatory neurotransmitters on as a function of the conditions being right and others are on as a function of the goal being achieved. And basically they drive the enduring changes of synaptic connections in the brain. The changes that are bi-directional uh… that is to say uh… sometimes she goes a little bit backward to go forward what we'll hear more about that later and we've heard a little bit about that earlier. They're controlled from the top not just from the reward but also they're also controlled from our working memory because she has already constructed at this age a notion about what the store uses all about and she's made a lot of fries and she has the memories from all of that of what is successful or effective and she's using that to guide her shape, success continuously as she's acquiring this ability. The changes are actually controlled from the top. When I hold something in mind as a goal and all of its complexities that relate to getting to that goal I'm keeping this in mind uh… some things very much in the foreground other things in the background. I'm continually evaluating whether that the, the next try matches what I imagine to be achievement of that those goals. And I'm continually changing that model as I acquire the complex ability like this. And that's actually biasing how I what I can change for all of those things that can contribute to this complex ability. And these changes are by their nature inherently reversible. Now through brain change you've acquired and refined all of the special skills that that define you. And I, I've taken as example of these skills is looking down on the brain, an ability that probably everyone or almost everyone in the room here has acquired in that's ability to read and when you acquire something like the ability to read you actually create within your brain a reading brain. So you can look in the brain of somebody that's acquired ability like this, now reading is a relatively complex skill in which you're translating the sound parts of words very meaning in words by written script. So it's a high speed translation of what you hear and your word identities sound part by some part in this orthographical written form. It was a high speed ongoing translation. And when you look down at the brain or some of those acquired ability reading this is a, a sum of 17 children from a study led by John Gabrielle and, and colleagues at Stanford University, now he's at MIT. Now you can see that actually there's a couple bright spots that I pointed out there are actually six or seven in the reading brain that I could point to different places where we look in the left hemisphere and I'm pointing to two bright spots of that circle in green. And the more posterior of these circles in the reader that bright spot is area in which we know the fundamental translation from word sound to orthographic or written or letter representation is being made. Actually when you acquire this ability the primary activity is just below that the little bit more ventral to that just below that uh… green circle but once you have mastered reading it moves up into the circle. Okay, so this is a place an area between the visual and auditory domains of the brain where this translation is being made, where this, where this information is being uh… interpreted in at high speed. I just circled another area, the area or entered into it on your, on your left and that's an area in which we know there's a very strong correlation between your ongoing interpretation of the meanings of written words. Well, I could go through the other four or five areas that scientists have identified as crucial areas where different dimensions of reading. These areas do not exist or not activated in the nonreader. So what I see in the in the bottom panel and non readers are 20 matched children that they can't read in the same age just haven't been able to effectively acquire the, the wonderful uh… skill of reading. Uh… we could also just look at children that have just not got around to learning, reading and we'd see the same thing, of course, a nonreader does not have a reading brain. Now in a sense you have we could look at your brain from respective of your, your acquisition of a hundred skills that is sort of a core of what you're able to do. And in each one of those skills we could look at your brain from this perspective and we can see its specialization in skill after skill after skill after skill. So your brain is a function of mastering these skills has been changed each time in a way that it's relatively easy for us to define. But one of the things you'll see across the scientific literature is you'll see a paper a day about how the brain is different or actually 20 papers a day as a consequence of someone having different exponential history or someone mastering a new skill or improving that skill. In, in a sense this is a trivial experiment, I mean, it's always interesting to know how and where the brain changes but in reality skill activation is brain change. This is not a very complicated so very safe experiment to do. The only way you can screw it up is by not looking in the right way in the brain because skill acquisition or improvement comes from brain change we know. Now we, with, as we begin to understand uh… plasticity and its powers we began to uh… try to understand how it might be able to control the Genie of plasticity and we, and we began to look for a population to help and we chose as our first target in a collaboration with Paula Tallal and colleagues, Paula was a scientist at that time at Rutgers University. She's not University in California, San Francisco. The target we chose with children who struggle to read and struggle in other ways at school. So we actually created strategies to train these children intensively and, and, and when we trained them we saw that they relatively rapidly acquired a reading brain. So here's from the study from Gabrieli's Lab again in which we're looking down at the brain of children that are actually worked on the computer for about 20 hours in a progressive training strategy. And you can see that now we have activity in the circle posteriorly and in the circle anteriorly didn't have it before in these children. And you can also see that we have strong activity just below the circle more posteriorly we know that in another two or three months in these children it will be all up in the circle. This is exactly what we say when a child is acquiring reading. None of these children have been trained to read, training didn't involve reading, what the training involved was training the children to improve their listening accuracy because most children who can't read, can't read because a brain is representing to some parts of words in an inaccurate way. So the reason that that reading is unsuccessful in most children that can't read is because the translation for them of their representation of some parts of words to write it makes no sense, it's full of contradiction and error. So actually you have to train, train the brain in a sort of unsuspected way in order to acquire the ability to read with facility. You actually have to change the listening brain so that it represents the brain like it does, represent those some parts of words in a successful reader that's relatively easy to do. I might say across the world having trained many, many of these children about 80, 85% of children can be corrected and can successfully initiate reading if they're trained in this way as listeners. Now it's uh… all of that's another way of saying that when you think about correcting a problem that are logically in a child or an adult who struggle it's important you understand the neurology on a level in which you really know what the problem is. The problem, often the problem is not the simple thing in, in front of you. Though the natural instinct in psychology has always been to say well, what is it that this person can't do and the most obvious thing in front of them that they can't do is not necessarily the basis of the true solution. I have someone in front of me that's depressed, my natural instinct is to say, I've have to help this person be the less depressed. Stop being so depressed be more cheerful. Okay, worse in fact in the neurology of depression or anything the problem is almost always deeper and more complicated. And the true correction requires that you get to those basic aspects of chit change that relate to that deeper or more complicated series of things that need to be repaired. We trained about six million school age children using a form of training which is called fast forward. Uh… that which is what was represented here, uh… it was created by one of these two companies that I, that I, I found it with Paula Tallal. Or when you train a child in this way, in the same in this, in the current forms the training is the training that I showed you a 17 to 19 hours depending upon the age of the child. You see strong effects in improvement in their language ability because that's what you're trying to change or here we look at the impacts of language batteries that we derived, I'm sorry that this doesn't all show on the screen, I will correct it before the next uh… next uh… talk. But you see strong effects here we're looking at effect sizes and we're looking at children across the distribution. So uh… this the vertical line you, you can see in the middle of this plot is for children that are one standard deviation below the no median. And he said that anybody certainly to the left of that line is really struggling they're in the bottom of the distribution. And you can see that the improvements that they have in their basic language abilities are very strong. These are data from children who were trained most mostly by speech language pathologist uh… some other psychologist have done participate in some of these studies. You can see this is from uh… more than a thousand children. And uh… you can see that if a child sits at the 68 percentile the movement in improvement is about 1.4 standard deviations. Well, that carries a child well to the right of the normal medium and this is transformative in a child. The child that's operating in their language operations at in the 16 percentile who moves well to the right of the normal distribution is a child that's transformed. It's a child has real possibilities not just in reading but in language and communication that are going to be to their advantage for the rest of their days. I might say when you look at a language battery like this you're, you're including a lot of faculties that relate to language. Like how well they can remember it or how well they can manipulate or how well they use it in all kinds of ways. And all of those things are improved by this training. And not just on the listening side, also on the production of the language used the facile use of language side. So training a child in the right way that has a deficit like this can be truly transformative. And again when you look at these trailing going forward, this is just uh… one study from among it many, this is a results from the school district in Texas, in which you look at children that are struggling and reading. So these are children that are about two read levels behind and uh… and uh… unfortunately it's hard to see them before 'cause it's so dim here. But before reading they're about two grade levels behind and then immediately after training you can see that these children are bounced up to even though they haven't really been working at reading for say they're bounced up to about half the way to where you want them to be. And then when you look a few months later they're reading at grade level and above. When I showed you the plot before of the children in the brain imaging all those children that responsively, responded that and it was 17 to the 20 children were reading at grade level or before or above within a year. I would, I just want to say one of the little interesting thing about this study. The study was conducted with in a school I won't say what the name of the school was in the Bay Area, which is a school that even an…in that era 15, 16, 17 years ago, charge the tuition of $35,000 a year for a child to go for a school for dyslexics. The school had about 180 children that were non-readers in the school who were the coddled children of people largely from Silicon Valley. And uh… they were paying a very high fee to have their child be, be helped in their dyslexia. Three classes were given us, training program. And in those three classes, most of the children acquired the ability to read and left the school. The schools response was to withdraw our use of the program in the school, that was our response. They were literally going to be destroyed by the fact that these children were being repaired in the school. So their, their solution for that was to abandon it. So I know there's no one like that in this room that would do such a thing. We have these complex considerations that come in the way of actually delivering these, these thing, these uh… these forms of help in the, the world that sometimes can be very discouraging. So training is also targeted with children with greater struggles and we this is substantially an effort that that's coming from the second company that uh… I founded and, and that company is called a Posit Science. This includes children that have language attention and social cognition deficits in the autistic spectrum. Uh… children with ADHD, children at risk for the onset of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, we're trying to strengthen in a way that would prevent their, their uh… onset or delay it, children who had the great misfortune to have an extremely difficult early childhood. Uh… and uh… and these studies are all ongoing works in progress. So we have trials of studies in all of these areas in different places in the world and we're trying hard to make progress to deliver uh… strong reforms of help in all of these domains. Uh… we know that we can overcome inattentiveness and we know we can see this physically in the brains, I'm not going to talk about this because I don't have much time. We also know that we can overcome we can grow distracter suppression power in children with ADHD. We can see these changes in the brains of children and when we do that uh… we uh… when we do that we, what we see is relatively uh… complete recovery. It takes about 25 hours of training on a computer. The training involves two different, very different forms of training. One you could say is designed and up regulating the processes to control the release of noradrenalin which is uh… controlling the baseline level of arousal, that's substantially what we need to increase uh… in attentiveness, change in inattentiveness in a child. And the other relates to training the child systematically to, to deal with a controller focus on a task while they ignore distracters that are increasingly strongly interfering with what they're seeing or what they're hearing in their operations. And we do that over a period of time we almost always couple that. With uh… training that's uh… you could call it meditation like because many of these children are hyper sensitive in different ways and then also has to be part of what we do. Another primary focus in collaboration with scientists and clinicians in Australia and India primarily in Australia and India also in the US is to uh… is to try to neurologically rescue children who have had difficulty early childhood so I know there are people some people in this room that are very interested in this. Uh… so we know that a child that has a terrible early childhood for a variety of reasons especially children that are subject to severe neglect or abuse unfortunately all too common in the world amongst us. We know that uh… such a child like Billie here is that is uh… is subject to uh… significant probability of failure at school, for a later life of addiction, for misbehavior and criminal offending, for mental illness or terrible parenting in behavior grow up to become a parent for homelessness. Whole series of things are in the offing for a child that has a history that's not sits uncorrected in early life. There could be nothing more transformative in modern society than to find all of these children and just help them and fix them. And what we do now to a large extent in our (inaudible ) world is, is terrible, almost immoral. And the basis of our understanding of the brain and its plasticity and the fact all of these children can be helped. We know now that almost everything that would help would define that the brain of such a child is abnormal, is correctable, maybe not perfectly, but substantially correctable. So one of the… my main goals in life in fact is to try to bring the kind of training and we're gonna talk more about this a little bit later, to bare, to help or wipe out this outcast society that plagues us. And that uh… is such a disaster for so many children innocent individuals amongst us. I was going to talk about this one, one thing we know about this, of course, is that it's not the kid's fault. Now I just want to end this lecture by saying in the, in my next couple hours I'm going to discuss how we're applying these brain-training tools in the workplace, to treat specific clinical indications and to manage brain health. So that's what we're going to get into. But I want to leave you with this first pass with an example of what taking advantage of this great gift of brain plasticity could mean to you. So we're going to look at the case of this guy whose name is Todd Sampson. So the story Todd Sampson is, is about four years ago I was approached by the Australian Broadcasting, which is like the NPR in Australia. Uh… if and ask if I would participate in a program in which the goal… of which the idea was to find an average Australian citizen and see whether you could change his brain in a way that would be obvious and important to this individual across the three month period, where that would be possible. And basically uh… to demonstrate the fact that brains are plastic and that this would contribute to the potential improvement of a life in a human even in average individual. So I said, "Well sure we could do that." And uh… and I, you know, there'd be no reason why we couldn't do that so the average individual they came up with this guy Todd Sampson turns out Todd Sampson was already a television personality in Australia. Uh… he's now the number two or three most recognized Australian. In part about what I'm going to talk about and that's a program that we created with him but at that time he was already in the top ten. It turns out Todd Sampson is, was the president and CEO of the largest advertising company in Australia. Uh… a division of Leo Burnett which is Chicago based International Corporation and Todd Sampson is a very, very smart and special person. The reason that Australians knew him was Australian public television had a program in which they looked at the way advertising was trying to fool the public. Uh… and it was a big hit in Australia and Todd Sampson was alone he was the president CEO of an advertising company. He was he was identified as some of that stuck up for the public. And he make a long story short uh… once I met Todd Sampson and, you know, they said, well, can you change this guy? And I said well sure. But it's going to be a little bit more challenging and we're going to have to start a little higher level. So what we did is, I organized a program for this guy over a three month period that involved brain training on the computer. And, and then the improvement of other sort of practical real world skills to try to improve his ability and what he could accomplish in life. So he's trained it to master the tricks of remembering, he was trying to overcome his fears in certain ways, he's trying to uh… to uh… to hold his breath. I will be relevant to what I say in a second and a, a series of other things that relate to practical skills and abilities. And in the course of this program what we did is we extensively evaluated his cognitive abilities, his perceptual abilities, what Todd could do and couldn't do behaviorally and looked at about 20 things behaviorally. And then we did seven different brain damaging brain recording uh… studies and which we look at different aspects of the operations of this neurology. At the end of the first program if you watch this series redesign on my brain which you can get on You Tube or wherever you'd see that Todd went to the World Memory Championship and came in 53rd in the world in card counting. There were 3,000 contestants so he was the best Australian and did quite well at this task a month out. At the end of the program you would see that Todd went underwater and did a Houdini escape from, from a straight jacket underwater Trek, which means that you have to perform 212 acts in sequence without air, or you can't do it and he did that. He could remember those 212 steps in sequence and, and he performed them under the conditions or rather challenging conditions of being underwater for two minutes. And when we looked in his brain we saw that everything was better. Everything could be interpreted as being stronger or better when we looked at his behavior it worked on a computer for about 35 hours in training he worked about an hour and a half to two hours a day on these different tasks everything had changed for the better. When he looked at his behavior he, he topped out in most of the way assessments that we applied. He made almost no errors. He was clearly moved to, to a higher performance level as a consequence of training. So when you looked at the brain at a task in which activity is quoted with intelligence in this region that you see in the red this is the difference between after versus before. This, these are the positive gains you could say that would, you translate to this in those tacit, so it's (inaudible ) with fluid intelligence. When you looked at something like brain speed, you look before and after training. You see before training at 100 milliseconds in time, there's no activity in the acceptable cortex and that's visual, visually cued uh… attention task. But after training actually activity is initiated about 60 milliseconds. And you see stronger activity occur early on time at every moment from that point forward in time. We saw changes like this in everything we looked at in the sky. Oh, why not train everyone struggling, or we may not struggling, like we trained Todd Sampson. Like it, we think of every individual on the planet, every one of you as being subject to potentially dramatic personal improvement or advance. Based upon paying attention to your needs, you could say, or how you want to improve or be better or stronger. Everyone on the planet has a potential of being much more effective, much stronger in what they do in, in their profession and in life, in ways that would advantage them in life by engaging their brain using this precious resource. So in the next couple of hours that we have to talk about, this is what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about how we can drive a brain to change it for the better, to the advantage of you and to the advantage of the human individual that you're trying to help. Thank you very much. I told you I was a nerd.
