BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
SYLVIA MCMILLAN Today, I'm gonna be talking about Counseling Arab-Americans, Understanding Historical and Contemporary issues. My name is Sylvia Nassar McMillan. I'm a counselor-educator and I'm a scholar committed to promoting the education about Arab-Americans and their counseling issues. Today, what I'm gonna be doing is, I'm gonna be providing three, three portions to this training program. Part one, I'm gonna be, in, in part one, I'm gonna be defining Arab-Americans. I'm gonna be talking a little bit about demographics and diversity within the Arab-American community nationally, Arab-American culture, and socio, sociopolitical issues from both past and present. The second portion of this video, we're gonna be going to, uhm, ah, an interview session with several of my colleagues who will be introduced later. In the third part of the video, we're gonna be summarizing some of the content that is covered in, that will be covered in the interviews, as well as ah, talking about additional implications from practice, including counseling considerations and local and national resources. 

00:01:20
SYLVIA MCMILLAN In terms of demographics and diversity, there are a lot of ways that in which Arab-Americans are defined within the popular media. Some people define Arab-Americans or Arabs as people from, ah, Arabic-speaking countries, or having origins from Arabic-speaking countries, or from the Middle East, which is concept that was really, uhm, defined by the west, the U.S. and other western entities, which en, encompasses the Arab Middle East or the, the Arab league that I'm gonna be talking about momentarily, but it's, it's actually much broader. So you're gonna hear me refer to the Arab Middle East throughout the courses of this video. Uhm, some people define Arabs as Muslims or Muslims as, as Arabs. But, as we'll talk about more later, ah, the terms Arab and Muslim are not interchangeable. All Arabs are not Muslim and all Muslims are not Arabs. Uhm, and for, for the purposes of our definition, we defined Arab-Americans as anyone having ancestry or claiming ancestry to anyone of the 22 league of Arab States, state-nations. And that league of Arab states spans, ah, the continent of Asia and Northern Africa, Africa, but in the northern part of Africa. 

00:02:45
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  In terms of immigration waves of Arab-American, Arab-Americans to the United States. The, the immigration patterns really took place in Florida State waves. And I'm gonna talk a little bit about what those waves were and then also some of the acculturation strategies that tend to characterize individuals who, uhm, who immigrated in a particular wave. The first wave occurred at, around the turn of the century, along with a lot of other immigrant groups coming to the United States around that time, primarily seeking better economic opportunities. If you think about ah, world history and U.S. history over the last hundred years, that's when really a lot of people came over here in, in seek of better, in search of better economic opportunities. In the case of Arab-Americans, some of the immigrants from that wave also were, uhm, seeking to escape the Ottoman regime, which was a non-Christian, it was a Muslim regime, and, so, they felt persecuted and, and along with wanting to seek better economic opportunities, they chose to emigrate to the United States. In terms of their acculturation, or it's the, their acculturation strategy, that generation assimilated relatively quickly. Now, let me tell you about the demographics of that particular wave. Uhm, those people were primarily uneducated; merchants, peddlers, and they were primarily Christian laborers, so that group quickly welcomed or welcomed the new values of the host culture and quickly assimilated, meaning that they quickly took on the lifestyle and, and some of the traditions of the new host culture. So, the second wave occurred post World War II and it's often referred to as the "Brain Drain," because a lot of these people, in contrast to their predecessors, were very highly educated. Now, this particular group was primarily, ah, Muslims, and they came, primarily to escape regional tensions in the Arab Middle East. So, when they came, the way that they acculturated, to the culture in the U.S., is that they, they remained relatively committed to upholding their Arabic traditions. The third wave, was similar demographically to its, the previous wave, ah, and that they were more educated and predominantly Muslim. But they came primarily for economic opportunities, except for Palestinians. There was a group of Palestinians who do not come necessarily for economic opportunities, but rather to, uhm, escape perceived persecution in their homelands and, ah, so that was the time that they, that, that particular group chose to, uhm, emigrate to the United States. In terms of the acculturation strategies of this particular wave, these individuals and families became very successful in the professional assimilation, and, and again, in terms of just assimilating into the, the professional mainstream and culture, but maintained their personal and social Arabic traditions. The fourth and most recent group represents refugee populations from Lebanon and most recently from Iraq over the last 10- to 15-year period, uhm, since the early 1990s. And like many other refugee groups, these individuals and families harbor a hope that someday they may return to their home country, uhm, or to some place in, the Arab Middle East. And so, because they hold on to that hope, they don't necessarily embrace the host culture and its new traditions and values because, uhm, that would be too dichotomous with their, with their goal of, one day returning to their homeland. So, in terms of these different groups being represented in the Arab-American population overall, the largest group of self-identified Arab-Americans, would be the Lebanese. And probably followed then by Syrians and Egyptians, and Palestinians with smaller groups of Moroccan and Iraqi, uhm, groups. But I, I'd also like to say that there are even, even within that diversity, there are some cultures such as Chaldeans which is a Christian group that, uhm, lives in Iraq and has somewhat of a different historical background and, and even religious background, but are still, when we talk about Arab-Americans, we're, we're limiting, for the purpose of this program, uhm, the definition to anyone coming from those particular countries of origin, those 22 league of Arab state nations. 

00:08:10
SYLVIA MCMILLAN In terms of settlement areas, ah, there, there are several states, a number of states that have sizeable Arab-American communities within them, in sizeable populations, overall state populations. Those are California, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. And in terms of actual enclaves, and when I say enclaves, I mean, ah, Arab-American ethnic communities, close-knit ethnic communities, would, would be found in New York City, Dearborn, Michigan, LA, Chicago, Houston, Detroit, San Diego, Jersey City, Boston, and Jacksonville. Although I really would have to say that almost every major metropolitan area is going to have some Arab-Americans represented within the community. In terms of other demographics, ah, in, in terms of age, specifically, compared to other ethnic group counterparts, Arab-Americans tend to have a younger population overall, or younger people in the, in the population, and more foreign-born individuals than other ethnic groups. In comparison to the national averages, not compared to other ethnic groups but national averages overall, ah, their educational lev, levels tend to be somewhat higher than the mainstream national average. Their incomes tend to be slightly higher and their divorce rates tend to be slightly lower than the national averages. 

00:09:55
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  In terms of religions and religious traditions, I'd like to talk a little bit about what's on the demographic break, breakdown, sorry, with, with regard to religion. Contrary to popular opinion, the majo, majority of Arab-Americans are not Muslim, they are Christian. In fact, uhm, the 35 percent of Arab-Americans are represented by Catholic, the Catholic faith, including Roman Catholic, Maronites, and Melkite, Greek Catholic. Twenty-four percent only of Arab-Americans are, represent, mu, the Muslim faith, which includes Sunni, Shi'a and Druze, for the most part. Uhm, 19 percent rep, represent Eastern Orthodox, 10 percent represent Protestant religions and 13 percent represent other or no religious affiliations. So, again, in terms of demographics, since the majority of Arab-Americans are non-Muslim, there are many religious traditions that are gearing out in the mainstream United States that are also val, valued by, by Arab-Americans, ah, as well, religious traditions, cultural traditions and many overlapping holidays. For Muslims, there are two additional holidays that are very, ah, very important. 

00:11:35
SYLVIA MCMILLAN And I'm gonna talk a little bit more about these later, but just to mention them, the first is Eid al-Fitr, which is the celebration that ends the month of Ramadan, which is a period of fasting for Muslims. And Eid al- Adha, at the, at the end of Hajj, which is a pilgrimage that Muslims aspire to make to Mecca, the holy place for Muslims. 

00:11:55
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  Arab-American Culture: 

00:12:00
Middle East & Islam 5 Pillars of Islam Arab Values: collectivism & family, religious faiths & practices, educational & economic achievements, civic contributions 

00:12:00
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  I wanna come back to the issue of the term, the terms Arab and Muslim being used interchangeably. Although 80 percent of the Middle East is Muslim, Islam only represents 20 percent and, ah, Arab-Americans or Arabs only represent 20 percent of Islam in the world. So, you can see there's, there is certainly some overlap but, that there are many Moslems who are not Arab or have Arab origins, but, and there, there are also, you know, it has been talked about earlier, many Arab-Americans who do not have a Muslim background. However, having said that, since, since Islam is still prevalent in the Arab Middle East, there are many, there have been many encircle, influences on Arab society, and I'll talk more about those in a moment to you. Well, okay, in, ah, back to Islam in 7 to 10 AD, the prophet Mohammed was revealed to the Arabian peninsula as a messenger of God. And God spoke to the prophet Mohammed via the Archangel Gabriel, who brought words of Allah or God in Arabic. And those words became the Koran. The Koran is built upon the teachings of the Old and New Testament, it represents the continuation of the Old and New Testaments. It's also important to note that, that Arab-Americans believe, and Arabs believe that they are Semitic peoples, meaning that they are descendants of Shem, and this is a similarity that they have with, uhm, their Jewish counterparts, that they're, they're also Semitic. Some, some Islamic beliefs are about, around a concepts of heaven and hell, which are also believed by, ah, Moslems believe in the concepts of heaven and hell, ah, accountability to God, self-responsibility, global unity and race relations. There are five main pillars of Islam. The first of those is Shahadah, which is the declaration of faith. The second, Salat, formal worship 5 times daily. Sawm, which is the fasting during the month of Ramadan. And, Zahah, which is alms-giving toward social and economic justice, I think that's a really important component to be aware of, that it's not just giving to charitable causes, but specifically to, ah, social and economic justice. And the fifth is Hajj, which represents the pilgrimage to Mecca, the holy place for, for Moslems. 

00:15:00
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  A few other, ah, few other items that are important to know, that the holy day for, for Moslems is Friday. A central tenant of Islam is peace and then, along with some of those values, some other values that characterize Arab-American culture, Arab culture, are collectivism and family, and I'm gonna come back to this one in a moment. Ah, religious faiths and practices, as we've already mentioned, ah, they do, Arab-Americans do tend to value their religious and faith traditions highly. And in addition, they, and, and, as, as we talked about earlier in terms of the demographics with educational and economic achievements, uhm, in comparison to the national averages, those are values that are, uhm, held dear by Arab-Americans. And finally, civic contributions, so you'll find a lot of Arab-Americans that are, are involved in civics or governmental leadership. Back to the collectivism and family, I, I wanna mention that one, that many, ah, ethnic groups are considered collectivistic and that, and I think collectivistic in contrast to the indivil, individualistic, uhm, culture that tends to characterize mainstream American, ah, value system, and this will play out in counseling, and we'll talk about this more later. But so, so that, the, the collectivism refers to the greater good of the, the unit, and the the unit is not the individual, it's the fa, it's the couple or the family, or the community, the church, it's, it's the larger group. Uhm, and that's one of those traditions that's not necessarily, you know, linked to Islam. It's, but it is a way in which, you know, Islam and Arab culture are intertwined. Arab culture, uhm, Arab society began as a tribal culture, like many other ethnic groups, where the tribal survival was dependent on the, the collective unit and each person having his or her roles. So, in, in that context, when you think about the Arab family as the unit, uhm, it's, it's the way that it, uhm, the hierarchical structure of the Arab family is maternalistic, meaning that the father is typically the head of the household and everyone has prescribed roles within the family unit, and sometimes those are, ah, linked to gender, you know, sometimes traditional gender roles. But those are really operationalized much differently within different communities, different levels of acculturation, uhm, different waves of immigration and, ah, so that's important to note. 

00:18:05
SYLVIA MCMILLAN Okay, the final piece that I'd like to talk about before we move to the interview portion is sociopolitical background. I'd like to begin by talking about the historical context between, ah, Islam and the West. And when I say the West, I mean the United States, ah, Great Britain and some of the other European, uhm, superpowers over time. Uhm, you know, all the way back to the crusades, the Ottoman empire, uhm, there have been conflicts between Islam and the West, and, you know, due to some perceived cultural religious gaps, you know, we tend to understand people who, who are most like us, and we don't understand them because they are not like us, then we tend to be fearful or suspicious, or develop stereotypes that may or may not, may not be true. Uhm, the, so the portrayal of Islam in the West has not necessarily been a positive portrayal in the media and a lot of other, uhm, resources. And, in fact, the perception of Arabs and Arabism is often that ah, that Arabs and Arabism pose a threat to U.S. national interests. In terms of more contemporary times, you know, coming, coming up little bit from the Crusade and the Ottomans, uhm, in contemporary times, Britain was the, was the primary, ah, occupier of Pal, Palestine and to, you know, through, up until through the 1940s, and then it wasn't until post World War II that the U.S. became involved with, and along with, you know, with global support for the establishment of Israel, and it was at that time that, that there were, you know, became heightened tensions between Islam and the United States in particular. In terms of immigration, I think it's important to know that just like many other ethnic group counterparts, the immigration history sort of paralleling the, the waves of the immigration we talked about earlier, ah, was not always a smooth road for immigrants. And in fact they were several different destinations given to Arab-Americans during the immigrations history of the United States. They were designed to, ah, classify the much as we now, but to classify them with the intent to limit or restrict immigration from, from that particular region of the world. Ah, at different times in history, chronologically, ah, Arab-Americans were referred- 

00:20:40
Census Classifications of Arab Americans over time European American 

00:20:40
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  to as being from Turkey in Asia, as Syrian, as Asiatic, as Colored and as Other. Contemporary designation according to the U.S. Federal Government is that Arab, that Arab-Americans are classified as being White or having European-American origins. Now, this is point that is often disputed within Arab-American communities nationally, because uhm, it's not considered an accurate representation of the historical, uhm, the historical truth of, of, ah, Arab culture. In terms of current events, coming, that brings us into the present, there are a number of issues that are at the forefront of- 

00:21:35
Sociopolitical Background 

00:21:35
SYLVIA MCMILLAN - people's minds in the Arab-American community. And it's not that, one thing I didn't talk about in demographics was political affiliation. And, really, there's no, there's no particular political affiliation that Arab-Americans subscribe to. Just like in any other culture as well as the main, the mainstream, uhm, U.S. society. People have a variety of political affiliations and beliefs. And so it's not to say that Arab-Americans as a whole are, are conservative or liberal or Republican or Democratic because that, there's not, uhm, which is really no rhyme or reasons to that philosophy. However, depen, no matter what their political affiliation or their political beliefs, the issues that are at the forefront are 9/11. The tragic event of September 11th of 2001 are forever etched in everyone's mind. Every, every person's mind. And for Arab-Americans, in particular, there has been, uhm, a backlash on, in several arenas. Legislative backlash, uhm, hate crimes, personal ah, and much larger sorts of, sorts of backlash where people feel, ah, that their civil liberties are really endangered. They feel targeted and profiled. So those were issues that Arab-Americans, that, that's a particular issue that Arab-Americans think about a lot. The second issue is the U.S. involvement in Iraq. And again, Arab-Americans don't have this, ah, unified view on what, on what should be happening in Iraq. What, what the U.S. involvement should be in Iraq, in Iraq. But they pretty, the consensus though is that is critical issue for Arab-Americans and their concerned about, uhm, about how the U.S. handles that issue. And they think about it a lot. And the third issue that I mentioned, I've mentioned it a few points peripherally, is the issue of Palestine. And, that the US's involvement with, uhm, the Palestine-Israel issue. And, you know, it's not that everyone thinks that all Arab-Americans having a unified view on what the situation should be, but it is an issue that people are concerned about. 

00:23:55
Voices From The Field-Interviews: Sandra Amen-Bryan, M.A. Ray Kamoo, Ph.D. 

00:23:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Hello, I'm Dr. Julie Hakim-Larson. I'm from the commu, the Detroit area community. I'm a child clinical psychologist and I've done some research and scholarly work with the Arab-American community. I have with me here Sandra Amen-Bryan, who is a psychologist who works in the Arab-American community and Ray Kamoo, Dr. Ray Kamoo from the Detroit area community as well. And both of them are here today to answer some interview questions with me. But before we move on to that, each of them is going to tell us a little bit about themselves. Sandra? 

00:24:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Okay, Julie, thank you. I am a Masters of psy, Psychologist. I have been working in community mental health for 20 plus years. And the last 10 have been with a local Arab ah, human services organization. 

00:25:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Ray. 

00:25:05
RAY KAMOO Thank you, Julie. Uhm, I'm Ray Kamoo. I'm a licensed psychologist and I'm in private practice in the Detroit area and I work with individuals both ah, children, adolescents and adults ah, from the mainstream American community as well as from the Arab and Chaldean communities 

00:25:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Thank you, Sandra and Ray. We're gonna move on to our first question which is: Since the tragic events of September 11th 2001, what have you found to be the top four mental health issues that have faced Arab-Americans? 

00:25:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON And we're going to start with Sandra for that question. 

00:25:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Okay, Julie. In addition to the normal presenting issues that we will see with any community, such as the problems of depression, anxiety, family issues, parenting problems, we are also seeing an additional layer of the psychosocial issues that make the primary presenting problem that much more difficult to confront. And what I am referring to are the issues of housing and employment that come with the immigration status and the refugee status that so many of our individuals are facing. So, we are seeing the more difficult prospect of normalizing a life given that you are facing language barriers. You're facing cultural barriers. And of course, these issues are going to seriously impede someone's ability to find a job and to, uhm, to raise their earning potential and their earning power so that they can ah, transition to the society and, and stabilize themselves. So, from my, my perspective, it is these, the additional layers as well as an additional layer of fear now that is coming from the problems of, ah, some discrimination and also just the fear of what will happen. You know, what will happen when I fly? What is the potential of making my normal donations, for example, to the Islamic charities. So, many people feel now that they are being profiled and that their lives are now under a microscope. And so it increases the discomfort and the, the general fear that, that somebody may have just trying to live a normal everyday life. 

00:27:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. Okay. Thank you, Sandra. Ray? 

00:28:00
RAY KAMOO I, uhm, I share some of the same comments that Sandra ah, just mentioned. In my practice, ah, which is, ah, I, the clientele that I see a little different because it is private practice. Uhm, but for the most part, the issues that, that Arab-American and Chaldean patients bring with them into the therapy, wasn't really all that altered by the events of 9/11. I mean certainly it was a tragedy, but, ah, immediately afterwards, the anxiety and the depression that I was seeing in patients was heightened that much more. The, the more salient, excuse me, issue that I found was regarding the discrimination. Ah, people were very nervous about the fact that perhaps ah, because of the way they look or perhaps because of their last name, they would be perceived in a certain light, in a prejudicial light. So that was one of the more immediate concerns. But for the most part, the issues that I see are, ah, a much of the, a time issues that I've seen in the mainstream community. Issues revolving around depression, uhm, cultural assimilation, cultural difficulties in general, divorce, uhm, and things of that nature. And, and I find that, depending of what level of acculturation they are. It, it, it introduces a whole new set of variables into their problems. So, for example, if I'm dealing with someone who represents a first generation family, their issues maybe markedly different than, let's say, someone who is a new immigrant. And what I find is that, most of the forces that bring them into therapy involved where the patient or where client fits in into the larger mainstream culture. How do they retain their cultural identity yet still fit in into the larger mainstream American culture. Ah, how does religion play a role, is it prominent as it is let's in say, the Middle East, or is it not as prominent here in the United States. Ah, issues of depression, divorce is becoming more and more prevalent in the community which, ah, really reflects or mirrors, uhm, some of the issues that we see, demographically in the larger, ah, American culture. So, 9/11, while it certainly was a, a tragic event, uhm, simply heightened some of the existing issues, excuse me, whereas it didn't introduce a whole new set of issues per se. Uhm, there was one gentleman in particular who was extremely paranoid about his last name and the dark features. And he was convinced that somehow he'd be singled out ah, by the U.S. government and that he'd be grouped to the category where all Mid-Easterners, since it was a Middle Eastern group that, that ah, carried the 9/11 tragedies through, that we'd be all lumped together and we'd be, ah, discriminated against in that fashion. So, uhm, but after a short while, ah, those kinds of matters settled. So, that was certainly... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
RAY KAMOO ...good to see. And then we dealt with some of the more, ah, psychological issues that kinda underlied they're, they're original ah, entry into therapy. 

00:31:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON I see. Thank you very much. We'll move on to the next question that then concerns: What are the typical treatment goals for your Arab-American clients? And we'll go back to Sandra. 

00:31:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Okay. Thank you. You know the, the treatment goals for many, many of the people that I see, we, we start off very generalized. So when you ask people, "Well what are your expectations? And what are you hoping to achieve for yourself through these services?" They will tend to give you very generalized answers, "Well, I want to feel better." " I want my life to be like it was before." And so, then your work with the person will, will have to necessitate getting them to focus a little bit more on what, what can they do to help normalize their emotions and their mental status. And oftentimes, this will take, ah, more of interpersonal approach. So by that I mean, we are not likely to engage in a lot of analysis. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So this is not the type of situation where, for example, psychoanalysis would be the, ah, ah, preferred approach. Or the approaches where it, ah, focuses in a lot on, on ah, an insight-oriented approach. So the a, the approach that I take most often is a supportive and a psycho, psychosocial type approach. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  So, I am using my background, my reference with them, my uhm, didactic teachings on things like coping skills. What is depression and anxiety. And what can you do in terms of making small changes in your life to help, ah, stabilize. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And then for a, a select group, we have to then get very specific in, in reference to some of the traumas that they might be experiencing. So, for example, some of the survivors of ah, political torture. You have to counsel people on limiting their exposure to media. So you have to teach them how not to watch TV so often. And if they are, ah, going to follow the news, encourage them to read more stories than watching them on TV because that tends to give them a higher emotional impact when the you're watching ah, a film coverage and also hearing a report. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And, you know, you know how news reports are, they just, ah, they run the same footage over and over again, all day long, whether it's on TV or whether it's on the Internet. So you have to structure their need to know what's going on in their home countries and what is possibly going on with their families, in comparison to their need to keep themselves emotionally stable on a day to day basis so that they can take care of themselves and take care of their families. 

00:34:45
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. Okay. Thank you, Sandra. And Ray? 

00:34:50
RAY KAMOO I would, ah, I would ah, like to just add. Ah, first of all, I agree with Sandra. I think many of the approaches have to be, very generalized. They're very psychosocial in nature, so I think, ah, that's seems probably to be, ah, kinda a denominator at working with, with uhm, with this population. One of the first things that I tried to do with my patients is, just try to introduce them to the whole notion of what therapy is. Again, depending if they're recent immigrants or first generation individuals... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
RAY KAMOO ...ah, the forces that bring him into therapy often, it's not always, you know, ah, of their own volition that they're, that they're in there because a spouse is forcing their hand or a relative is forcing their hand. So one of my first goals is to really introduce them to what therapy is. Kinda break down these preconceived notions that they have of what therapy is. Ah, in the, in the Middle Eastern culture on many different levels, counseling or therapy is seen as something only for crazy people. So that's... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
RAY KAMOO ...one of the first things I'd try to make them understand that, yes it can help people who are psychiatrically ill but on the other hand, it can help people also with very typical day-to-day problems. Once we kinda get through that and we tried to establish what their problems are, we try and kind of live in the here and now. You know, as Sandra was saying, ah, very psychodynamic approach doesn't always work with this group of people. And the reason is not because they don't have the ability to be introspective, it's because sometimes they don't buy into the process that they can be part of their own treatment. So, in using kind of a supportive stance and establishing short term goals that are very pragmatic, it helps them to understand that therapy really is what they wanted to be and that they... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
RAY KAMOO ...are an integral part of that. And it isn't the therapist only ah, providing advice and, and in all this wonderful, uhm, things that they should do. And if they do them, all their problems will be solved. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
RAY KAMOO While on many levels that is applicable, it also short term practicable. It helps them understand that they're part of the process. And then... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
RAY KAMOO ...by being of the process, that's how they can affect change. And those, those general issues are, have to be prominent in the beginning of therapy. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
RAY KAMOO  Because again, they have to understand that the therapy session can benefit them. (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
RAY KAMOO And by approaching it on a short term basis versus more of long term goals, it helps them gain, you know, certain, successes along the way. That the, the goals are too out of reach. Too long term. It, it kind of, it, it's, it's, can be depressing in the general sense. In the sense that they're not attaining these, these successes along the way. So you have to set up markers along the, along the path of therapy which are attainable. And that's why it's important to focus on the short rather than the long term ah, treatment issues. 

00:37:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Thank you. Do you want to add something, Sandra? 

00:37:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So they're going to put you in the role of the expert, but they're not necessarily going to follow you advice. So, (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
RAY KAMOO Yes, they absolutely. 

00:38:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  you have to play that balancing act and, and realize that even though people are going to ask you for advice and what should I do, they're, they're really not going to follow what, what you are suggesting until they get ready to do that. 

00:38:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And I, I'll a give quick example. There as, is a gentleman, we've been, we've been talking about his weight issue for probably the last three to four years. And he has known exactly what changes he has to make in his diet. And the, the weight has really been depressing because he has been gaining weight steadily over the last couple of years and of course it's bringing on additional health issues and feels lousy about his self image and, so, I, I did something a couple years ago that I didn't realize was going to show up as really such a successful intervention later. I had some tickets to one of the dinners that we were, ah, putting, on and I gave him two tickets for him and his wife. When he came... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  and he came in to see me a couple of weeks later and he said, "Believe or not, we are still talking about this event." 

00:39:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN He said, "It was so nice for me to feel like a normal human being. Just go to a place, sit down, socialize with people, be served dinner and enjoy the program." And shortly after that he came in and said, "Can you tell I've lost weight?" I said, "Yeah, I can. What, what, what have you done?" And he said, "Well, you know, I eliminated this, this and this from my diet." And, and the, the weight just started coming off immediately. He said, "And so I'm getting ready, the next time I go to one of those events, I'm going to have a suit on." (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, he has known all along what he had to, what he had to do but he had to get the right motivation. He had to do it for himself. Not because the therapist recommended or because the therapist said, "Yeah, that's a good idea. Why don't you do that?" He, he had to do it for himself. So, need, needless to say, I'm very happy with his progress. 

00:40:10
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Great, very good example. Thank you. We're gonna go back to the next question. What methods, techniques, or therapy approaches have you found to be best suited for your work with your Arab-American clients, Sandra? 

00:40:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Well, just to pick it back and go back for a moment, I, I mentioned that I gave this person two tickets to our dinner. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Now, this is not a, a very clinical approach. And, it is not the typical way that I would interact with someone. But what works best for the people that I work with is the, I, I will call it the psychosocial approach for just lack of a better term right now. So, because it is not a, a, a very strong ah, clinical approach in, in the sense of the traditional clinical practice, you have to bring yourself down a little bit more to the level where, where people are at. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, for example, you have, I, I tend to be a little bit more creative and go outside of the box in terms of my approaches with people. So, if it is socialization that they need, I might make recommendations of certain ah, religious institutions where I know what the program is, and certain uhm, other community activities, and they might be sponsored by the organization that I work for. So, I might be able to, for example, to invite them and their family to our regular holiday party. And then, I also, for some people I, I used home visits, because some people lack transportation. I might go to their home to consult with them. I had even gone and picked people up and, and brought them to the office. So, I realized that this is out of the sociological, the, the strict psychology approach to counseling. But, within the ah, community health delivery system, these approaches and these interventions are very consistent with ah, with the way that you would wanna deliver services. 

00:42:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON  Very good. Thank you. Ray? 

00:42:40
RAY KAMOO I, I would, I would agree wholeheartedly with what Sandra ah, just finished saying. I, I think ah, and as an extension of question number two, supportive therapy is very prominent ah, in at least in, in the work that I have done, the psychosocial approach as well. But really, ah, once you're taught in graduate schools, sometimes has to be left at the door. And that's not to suggest that what your taught ah, isn't applicable to the community, (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
RAY KAMOO you just have to be willing to kind of look at boundary issues. So, for example, they giving... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
RAY KAMOO ...up the tickets that Sandra just finished mentioning while that may be seen is kind of ah, ah, ah, crossing of boundaries between therapist... (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
RAY KAMOO ...or counselor and client, ah, it may not be so in this community. 

00:43:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
RAY KAMOO Having a psychosocial approach, having a supportive stance, let's you look at maybe changing the boundaries a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
RAY KAMOO  not for the sake of necessarily being ah, unethical or anything like that... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
RAY KAMOO  the bottom line has to be that you have to professionally help this person in front of you. So, by doing so, you have to understand that they come from a culture which may not understand the stringent guidelines, let, let's say, were taught in American graduate schools. So, accepting gifts is another issue, you know. In, in many cases, it can be seen as unethical as a way that the client carries favor from the counselor or the therapist. But in a lot of ways, it's very, very appropriate in the middle eastern community... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
RAY KAMOO ...because it's a show of thanks. (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
RAY KAMOO It's, it's that the patient or the client saying to you, "I appreciate your help". And while I'm not trying to gaining favor from you. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
RAY KAMOO I simply want you to know how I feel. 

00:44:25
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
RAY KAMOO They may not be able to put it into words. Having the supportive ah, stance... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
RAY KAMOO ...having the psychosocial approach to things, allows you to consider those things within the context of helping them. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
RAY KAMOO  So, I don't look at it as being an unethical or inappropriate uhm, mentality, it's simply putting yourself in the shoes of the client. (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:44:45
RAY KAMOO  Where, where is it that I need to be with this person to be the most ah, successful with them. And I think when you have that kind of notion in mind, your, your actions will certainly fall in line... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
RAY KAMOO ...you'll be the most beneficial to them. (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
RAY KAMOO So, so, psychodynamically informed introspective therapy while certainly the client is capable of it. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
RAY KAMOO I think, they tend to be more suspicious of it. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
RAY KAMOO Suspicious in a sense, is this really mental bantering back and forth, gonna benefit me in the here and now... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
RAY KAMOO ...having the supportive and psychosocial approach... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:25
RAY KAMOO ...puts it in a here and now and helps them understand that, yes, I can relate to this, this is very similar to our culture where if I spoke to an elder or ah, someone respectable in the community. It's kind of that, that social exchange that we try... (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
RAY KAMOO ...to mimic in the therapy session. That's very ah, helpful to them. So. (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Thank you. 

00:45:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN My, my colleague makes a very, ah, e, ek, very excellent example is, in terms of boundary issues and clinical judgment. Because, when you are taking... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...yourself out of that traditional office environment, and that protected environment that you are now going out into the community to deliver services, now your definition of boundary issues really has to be reworked. So, for example, I am going to someone's house. It is totally appropriate or polite for someone to offer you something to drink or something to eat. And then, there are other things that are going to occur. For example, if I walk into someone's house, I'm going to take off my shoes. (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Even though, they tell me not to, I'm going to do it simply out of respect. And so, there are numerous examples that we could give in, in relation to delivering services in this way. So, although, we are all trained ah, appropriately in our, in our clinical interventions, the more that we deal with people who don't fit in to this western mode of delivering clinical and mental health services, the more that we have to continue to discuss. What are appropriate boundary issues? What is good clinical judgment in all of these numerous... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  situations because our first goal should be to help heal the people that we are working with. 

00:47:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And certainly the, the AMA ah, modulus(ph), of first of all, do no harm. But, but after that, how, how do you meet yourself, how, how do you put yourself on, on their level? 

00:47:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And uhm, so, professionals have to know themselves well, and, and have to begin to be responsible enough to define for themselves and for their clients what is good clinical judgment and what are appropriate boundary issues. 

00:47:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON  Very good. Thank you, Sandra. Did either of you have anything you wanted to add about therapy approaches or techniques before we move on to the last question? 

00:48:00
RAY KAMOO Uhm, I think, the supportive/ psychosocial stance/willing to, to be somewhat eclectic has to play a role in, in working with this community. I think uhm, and that's, again, that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to kind of ah, take a little bit of every ah, you know, therapy, but you need to be willing to be flexible. I guess that's probably the most, ah, the best way to put it. You have to have flexibility... (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:48:30
RAY KAMOO ...in working with ethnically diverse populations. And really not just for the middle eastern community, but in, in working with any non-western community. (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
RAY KAMOO You have to be willing to kind of look outside the box, and, and see how can I best help this individual. 

00:48:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Thank you. Anything else you wanted to add? 

00:48:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Well, just again, in terms of ah, counseling approaches, it just tends to be uhm, sometimes a little bit more personal maybe than the traditionally trained person might, ah, might be comfortable with. But, you just have to understand that people are not there to fit in to your frame of reference. You are there to understand where they are coming from. 

00:49:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON  Okay. Thank you. Our last question is uhm, I'd like you to please give one example of how you used your knowledge of Arabic culture to help you to intervene with your clients. 

00:49:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Oh boy, just one example (laughs). Really limiting me here. Well, let me, let me try to answer that question in, in this way. I, I will tell you that many of the issues that people discussed with me, and most often, these are going to become very prominent in marital relations and parenting where their complaint is not so much of a psychological nature, but a cultural one. And so, for example, if I have a mother who was complaining to me about what her daughter is doing or not doing. For example, a teen-age daughter. Very often, this is going to be a cultural issue, and my, my ah, colleague mentioned earlier about dating and, and negotiating because maybe this girl wants to see someone who was out of her ethnic ah, group, and the parents might have to negotiate on this issue. Well, very likely, my parent is going to say, "There is no negotiation at all", and my adolescent ah, client is going to say, "You know, they're suffocating me at home". So, it, it's, it's critical that, that I understand what the feelings are from the family members when it comes to their children and, and how they are going to parent them these, these gender role issues, and, and how all, all of these is going to be played out. And like for example, when I had people come in who are in marriages where one is ah, maybe Arabic, one is not. I might have somebody complain that, "Well, he doesn't even greet my family properly when they come over". Well, the husband in this dyad(ph) is not being rude. He's just re, reflecting what, what he has grown up with. But, my, my uhm, Arab female client has very clear ideas about what are proper greetings when someone comes into her home. 

00:51:50
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And so, my approach is to then educate people on their own cultures. So, it's really back to the psychoeducational approach where I have to tell them very clearly, it's, it's not that someone is being rude here, it is just these are your cultural ideas about how greetings should happen, and, and some of these uhm, some of these other rituals. 

00:52:20
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:52:20
RAY KAMOO I, I would ah, I would answer similarly, and let me use an example, a dating example as well. Ah, I had recently ah, a mother and father contact me, and they were accompan, they came into my office along with the uncle of this young woman, and it was about dating. And it wasn't even dating about ah, someone outside of the community, it was about dating someone that they felt was wrong within the community. So, this, ah, their, her pa, and this was not an adolescent ah, young woman. This was a young adult. So, it goes to show you that irrespective of age, the dynamics are the same. And some extended family came there, and they came to me because they wanted me to understand what they were going through, me being a Caldian(ph) male. This was a Caldian(ph) family. So, what they would say to me is, "Well, you know how, how it is, Ray, you know what we're going through". And when I endorsed their feelings by telling them what my understanding of the culture is, that helps to establish rapport, and it kinda gets them on board with who I am. Once we get pass that, though, then it's an issue of what is it that you feel are the issues because despite the fact that we share the same ethnic uhm, affiliation, their issues are completely different than mine. (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
RAY KAMOO Uhm, I used, the example with my patients, my brother and I grew up in the same family, but he's very, very different than I am. So, once we kind of help them understand that we have the general understanding of what the cultural, (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
RAY KAMOO what the culture is, excuse me, and what the dynamics, how they play themselves out. Then, it's like tell me your personal life story... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
RAY KAMOO  in the context of a culture. And, certainly they're comfortable with the fact that what they say, I will understand because I represent that culture, it endorses what they think, but once again, that's just kind of the, the beginning phases. Once we kinda get into nitty-gritty if you will, then we have to understand what it is that brings them into the therapy. And it, when I work with couples, you know, often they'll ask me, "Well, ah, I, we see you're married. You have a ring on your finger. Is your wife American or she Middle Eastern?" Now, in a lot oh ah, in a lot of instances, I would say, "Why is that important?". In this particular instance, I would say, "She's American". Because they need to give a sense of, of am I on board with who they are. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
RAY KAMOO Uhm, other therapists would consider that an encroachment... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
RAY KAMOO ...and they, that's kind of a father grist for the mill about dealing with these issues in therapy. Yes, that's true. But again, that flexibility that I mentioned earlier... (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
RAY KAMOO  has to kind of come into play here and you say... (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:10
RAY KAMOO ...to this individual, she's American, why did you ask... (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
RAY KAMOO ...instead of saying what is that have to do with anything. And then, once they get a sense of, perhaps, I'm in a similar situation as them, that kinda opens the floodgates for what their prominent issues are. And really, that's what I capitalize out, how their personal story is affecting them, and I try to make them... (crosstalk) 

00:55:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:30
RAY KAMOO  understand that sometimes there are cultural issues, but sometimes they are not. I do have some patients who sometimes like to blame things simply on culture... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
RAY KAMOO ...when it's not culture, it's individual. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
RAY KAMOO Ah, but, it's easy to hide behind culture because it allows you to escape the work of making change, so. 

00:55:50
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. Very good. 

00:55:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I think ah, I think Ray made some excellent points that ah, if you're really trying to avoid the particular issue that drove you into the counselor's office in the first place, and that's certainly happens, there are a lots of other ways to avoid dealing with, (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:56:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN with situations that are, that are painful and, and uncomfortable. 

00:56:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON  Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And someone's ah, culture, their political orientation, (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  their ah, you know, I, ideas about their own communities certainly are ah, re, ready-made excuses. 

00:56:30
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:56:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Yeah. 

00:56:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Okay uhm, that concludes the structured interview questions. (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Was there anything either of you wanted to add before we conclude? 

00:56:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Well again, Ray, Ray make ah, a very good example of being, being asked a personal question. And so, when you're dealing with some particular cultural groups, and again, I don't, I don't think it's fair to limit this just to Arab groups. But, when people ask you a question about your marital status or who are you married to or do you have children, you have to be careful to not have your first reaction be one where you are offended, because you think someone is being too personal with you or invading your personal privacy. People are not doing it with that intention. Again, they're trying to see where you are coming from and, and are you going to be on board with them, will you be able to understand their particular situation. 

00:57:35
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. Okay. Thank you. 

00:57:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
RAY KAMOO Sa, Sandra makes a good point. Ah, the only thing, Julie, that I would add is just that uhm, through my work with ah, individuals from this community, actually, it's made me a better therapist working with individuals from the mainstream community. 

00:57:55
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:57:55
RAY KAMOO Ah, in the sense, it's kind of uhm, lowered my guard a little bit. Ah, you know, when we get out of graduate schools, we, we embraced everything we're taught from our professors, and that's certainly very important. But, we have to, you know, as my one professor used to say, take psychology to the people, and we have to be seen as a source of healing to them. So, in that sense, it's made me a better... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
RAY KAMOO  therapist. The, the other thing that I would like to the audience to know is simply that you don't have to be from the, in my opinion, from the Arab or the Chaldean communities in order to help individuals from that community. I think if you, if you're ah, an educated individual in the sense of ah, mental health or counseling, I think if you're willing to understand that there will be potential differences with this ah, client population, and that you're willing to, to really go along for the ride as they tell you who they are and what their problems are, I think you can be effective. I, I've seen it done and, and I myself worked with individuals from other communities. 

00:59:00
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
RAY KAMOO And obviously, I don't represent those communities, but again, I have, I, I'm willing to listen to what their individualized stories are, and that makes it effective, so. (crosstalk) 

00:59:10
JULIE HAKIM-CARSON Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
SYLVIA MCMILLAN  I think the interviews that we've just heard have really illustrated some critical and salient issues for anyone working with clients of Arab-American descent in today's world. In addition to some of the issues that the therapist brought up in their interviews ah, in terms of uhm, issues that they see, strategies that they utilized, and suggestions, I'd like to mention a few additional ones. For any population that you work with, you always take into consideration demographic issues such as gender, age, religion, faith, ah, skin color, things like that. And in addition, to some of those issues, in working with Arab-Americans, there are some particular areas that we can assess from a psychosocial level uhm, in terms of both risks and resiliencies. In terms of risks, I think one really examining issue, that was brought up in the interviews we heard, is the person's status in the U.S. I think that, uhm, not only does that speak to the acculturation issue where as you know, if they are citizen then they probably been here for a while, if they're not a citizen then there might be some you know, additional perils or fear of what might happen to them if, if they're targeted or profiled against, ah, so, so, so their status in the U.S. in terms of, uhm, immigration status, legal status. Another key point is discrimination trauma. As some of our therapist mentioned, discrimination traumas for many people, refugees and primarily have been just really impactful in terms of their mental health and their, their ability to function, uhm, in a healthy way. And that discrimination trauma spans their pre-immigration trauma, their immigration process and their post immigration trauma. I mean, if they were in a refugee camp, well, first of all, if they were in an oppressive regime where they were persecuted and, and, you know feared for their lives and that's a lot of ah, pre-immigration trauma. And then the process by which they had, you know, go to a refugee camp and then find a place where they could resettle, that's all part of it, the actual immigration, uhm, process. And that really represents a big portion of discrimination, I mean, uhm, of immigration trauma. And then finally, uhm, coming to a host culture that isn't necessarily welcoming of refugees from, from any part of the world but in particular in, in, uhm, you know, contemporary times, ah, and, and particularly for very recent refugees in post 9/11 times, the discrimination trauma in a host culture, the, the post-immigration trauma could be very, very great. I think somebody mentioned paranoia of last name but I think paranoia is something that I've heard a lot in talking with the therapists that, you know, clients have a paranoia but is it really a paranoia. If it's really valid that they're concerned about being deported or, or losing their immigration status or something like that, or about they're fearful for what might happen to their, ah, family that they left behind in their country of origin, then it, it kind of, it becomes more culturally appropriate to have some level of paranoia. Okay, in terms of resiliencies, there are a number of issues that can really support the acculturation process of Arab-Americans. And for like, like, for any other group, basic issues like safety and social support, functional status, faith, those are all really areas of strength socioeconomic status, educational level. In addition, uhm, ethnic identity development is, is an area that we're very interested in these days because, uhm, in addition to the way of the immigration and, and so forth, it seems like, uhm, the way that people have really responded particularly in post 9/11 times is by really reexamining their ethnic identity and really, ah, making some decisions about how they want to self identify or, or getting to a higher level of ethnic pride and, and ethnic, stronger level of ethnic identity development. And we see those as positives in terms of helping clients to acculturate in a positive way or to, uhm, you know, to really help boaster their mental health, their, their level of functioning. Couple other issues that, that sort of were implied in the, in the interviews that we've just seen, uhm, client-counselor relationships, I think the issue of, ah, whether people from a community want to work with an Arab-American therapist, want to work with a non-Arab-American therapist. Uhm, those were issues that there's no hard and fast rule for, but I think some of the issues that we've heard the therapists talk about really helped us to examine what are some of the issues that clients may have in seeking therapy or counseling and what are some of the issues we need to be aware of and, and be able to help them work through. Uhm, communication style is an issue that didn't necessarily come up in these interviews but, but being aware of that people from other cultural groups may have, ah, styles of expression that maybe different from the mainstream American culture particularly if one is a counselor or a therapist who is non-Arab-American working with an Arab-American client, Arab Americans may tend to be more expressive, they may tend to be non-linear in their thinking or the way that they present their thoughts, uhm, they may not be, ah, as likely to articulate their feelings and I think that, that really came across in the therapist's interviews in terms of not necessarily focusing on the psychodynamic in-sight focused approaches. Because, you know, they maybe aware of their feelings but they may just not, that may not be something that is a common, uhm, thing for them to, to express their feelings. They and, and to reiterate what's, some of what was already said, they may prefer problem solving, ah, focus and cognitive behaviorals, sounds like it might be really appropriate, versus insight-based therapies. The other thing that I want to reiterate that I know this come up several times in the interviews, is the importance of confidentiality and explaining confidentiality to clients because especially if you're working within a close-knit Arab-American enclave where community, uhm, that if, the fact that there are Arab-American counselors or therapists, might be a plus, it might be a minus. It might be a plus in the sense that person has more of a likelihood of understanding the cultural background of the client but it might be a minus in terms of the client being concerned about, uhm, the counselor not keeping the information confidential. So, it's just really, really important to be sure that your Arab-American clients really understand confidentiality, the limits of confidentiality, of course, but in particular, uhm, how that may be similar or different to their experiences in working with professionals or other people within their community. I'd like to mention one more thing in terms of, ah, cultural competencies. I think, uhm, you know, we, we've, we've learned a lot in, in the recent past about how important it is for therapists and counselors to be culturally competent in working with variety of ethnic minority clients. And, but just to reiterate, the six areas of cultural competence that, that are identified in the literature are attitudes and beliefs, impact of multicultural sensitivity and responsiveness, cultural competence in psychological education, cultural competency in psychological research, cultural competence in clinical practice and cultural competence in organizational change or policy development. And these are all cultural competencies even though some of you may just be in clinical practice or heading for clinical practice. These are all sighted as areas that we need to be aware of and, and culturally competent in or at least striving toward. Meaning, that even though we're gonna be possibly doing primarily clinical practice, we also need to be aware of our own attitudes and beliefs about this population. We need to be aware of how those attitudes and beliefs may interface with our clinical work. We need to be aware that when we're doing any kind of teaching or research or clinical practice, we need to be culturally competent. And the sixth, organizational change and policy development cultural competence that refers to social empowerment and advocacy and that is really critically important in working with Arab-American populations. That's a segway, a good segway to the, to the final portion of this program and that is resources. Uhm, some of the larger Arab-American communities will have their own set of unique resources unique to that community. But, uhm, but some national resources that, that are available to anyone via the web or via the agency itself, are the Arab-American Institute, which is I think the largest advocacy group in the world or organization in the world, advocating on behalf of Arab-Americans. The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Council on Islamic Education, AMIDEAST, which is an educational organization that has many really valuable educational resources to use in our practice and finally the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. So I really encourage you to explore some of these resources that are available to you and think about how you might utilize those in your work with Arab-American and non-Arab American clients alike. Thank you again.
