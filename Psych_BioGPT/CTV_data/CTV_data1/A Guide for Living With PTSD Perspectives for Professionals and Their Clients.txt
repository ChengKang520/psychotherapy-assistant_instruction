00:00:10
LAUREEN I was molested somewhere between the age of eight and twelve, umm… over a period of years. 

00:00:20
MICHAEL I served with the, uh… Marine Corps, 1st Marines, in Vietnam. Basically, I was a grunt, umm… in fact, they even called us super-grunts because of the weight we carried. 

00:00:30
HOLLY My ex-husband's main goal was terror, and terror is very paralyzing. 

00:00:40
SCOTT It was my 17th IED hit, it was an IED that blew up, umm… about a meter and half away from my head. 

00:00:50
LIZ Even before having the diagnoses of PTSD, I certainly had struggled with severe depression and actually had attempted suicide. 

00:01:00
SCOTT I could tell you that all four people in that tank that got blown up, there was four of them there, I treated all four, and medevac too. 

00:01:05
LAUREEN So when I had my breakdown right after that, I just couldn't stop crying, and I knew something was terribly wrong. 

00:01:10
MICHAEL We just got out and just… there was just small arms, rockets, mortars instantly. 

00:01:20
HOLLY The things that he always told me was, "If you leave me, I will destroy you." 

00:01:25
MICHAEL Thinking, you know, I want this to end, I just want the shooting to stop, umm… the intensity of it.

MATHEW J. FRIEDMAN PTSD, by other names has been around, uh, since men, women and children were potentially in harm's way, whether it was a saber-tooth tiger or a war or a natural disaster. Probably the most common civilian diagnose was railway spine that people who were exposed to train accidents in the late '90s, so in fact, it's said that Charles Dickens may have suffered from… from railway spine. In World War I, the term "shell shock", and the idea was being too close to the big guns was somehow jangling your nerves in the brain, called that combat exhaustion or combat fatigue in World War II. People who had been working with what we would now call "trauma survivors", of course by different traumas, uh, made a brilliant observation. And that was that it didn't matter whether it was war, rape, uh… natural disasters, uh, railroad accidents, that folks who survived these events seemed to have a, a common pattern of problems. Uh… and that's really how PTSD was born.

00:03:10
KIM MUESER Post-traumatic stress disorder is a pretty common disorder that follows exposure to a traumatic life event. Now traumatic life event is generally defined as an event in which, uh, the person experiences a threat of death or physical harm, or witnesses a threat of, uh, death or physical harm to another person and, at the time, experiences a strong negative emotion, anxiety, terror, fear, disgust, something like that. 

00:03:40
Mark McGovern Ph.D. 

00:03:40
Associate professor of Psychiatry 

00:03:40
Dartmouth Medical School 

00:03:45
MARK MCGOVERN Many people have horrible things happen to them, but unfortunately, those things really aren't in a… in a… a formal sense called "trauma". So it divorced, for instance, is arguably very stressful, very horrible, you know, gut wrenching, you know, traumatizing in a lay person's sense of the world… word, but doesn't necessarily count as a traumatic life event, it doesn't fulfill certain criteria that the American Psychiatric Association has defined as a traumatic life event. 

00:04:15
KIM MUESER What we know is that women are little bit more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder than are men. We also know that certain types of traumatic events tend to be a little bit more likely to cause post-traumatic stress disorder than others, and those include sexual assault or rape in adulthood, combat exposure, being a victim in a severe accident. All of those are fairly common causes of, of post-traumatic stress disorder. The kind of event that's most likely to cause post-traumatic stress disorder is childhood sexual abuse. 

00:04:45
Liz 

00:04:50
LIZ I should explain that the… the sexual trauma was not a one-time event. It was over a very long period of time, umm… starting actually when I was quite young. Umm… and as I came into teen years, you know, it also was escalating. My copping mechanism at the time was to turn to drugs and alcohol. Umm… but that also fed my depression. And as the alcohol increased, the depression increased. And there was a point at which I, umm… on two different occasions, attempted suicide. And I think it was after the second attempt, that was nearly successful, that I knew I needed to get help. 

00:05:30
Laureen 

00:05:30
LAUREEN I have all of these beliefs in place from what happened, and as they were happening, as I was eight, nine, I put this belief in place, and I took that belief into adulthood. And so as I entered my adolescence, I took the path of avoidance. I didn't date like other teenagers did. I didn't kiss. I didn't touch. And that carried on into my 20s. As I was trying to date, I would have this incredible fear of men when they finally came close to me. And just a simple little kiss good night made me want to physically push them back right away. 

00:06:05
KIM MUESER Everybody is vulnerable, or most everybody in the population could develop post-traumatic stress disorder if exposed to a sufficiently… a severe stress or set of stressors. 

00:06:15
Holly 

00:06:20
HOLLY The abuse was, sort of, gradual. He would do things like, umm… like grab my wrist and hold, umm… hold a lighter to my wrist and wouldn't let go. So I would try to back away and he would just grab tighter and tighter, where, where it's just starting to… where you can feel the heat and it's just starting to burn. I knew that it wasn't a good thing when he, umm… started becoming obsessed with guns. And he'd spend hours, like, cleaning and he'd just load it and unload it, load it and unload it. And then he would just talk about that, you know, I'd already signed my own death warrant. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN More than half of all American men and women, uh, in the course of their life, will have been exposed to at least one traumatic event, and 8 to 10% of all American adults may develop PTSD. 

00:07:10
Scott 

00:07:15
SCOTT We are taught to work in bad environments. You know, you are supposed to be interrupted by loud noises and things like that. There is so much that happened in my 14 months that I'm slowly starting to go through some of that. So some of these things are buried so deep right now, that I haven't… didn't want to look at. 

00:07:40
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN Something that we knew, uh, going into this is that the greater the exposure, uh, the greater the likelihood of PTSD. 

00:07:50
SCOTT It would have been a thing like crawling inside through a Humvee that got blown up by IED. Not even our patrol crawled through… go through the two bodies trying to get to the one that's living, okay? Get that person, double amputation, get them medevaced. 

00:08:05
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN The data is hard to come by. Uh, in terms of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, if we just look at where things are at this point in time, that the prevalence of PTSD is may be roughly around 17%. 

00:08:20
SCOTT After we zip-up the other bodies in the body bags, we have, have to bring them… the bodies back. But we have to go continue our mission looking for IEDs, and then try to get some sleep. The next day we go out, and next… This is the cycle. 

00:08:35
Michael 

00:08:40
MICHAEL Traumatic experiences, uh, there were a range of them. When I eventually went in to therapy, the one that I think my therapist focused on was, umm… I was on guard duty, you know, my job is just, you know, constantly scan the perimeter. But I happened to be looking back and noticed the couple of boys who had, kind of, scurried, scurried by my tower and went to a hooch right nearby. And I saw them place something in a garbage can that was right there, and then they ran, ran back towards the front of the base. The garbage can went up. It was a satchel charge. You know, everyone instantly knew what was going on. The M60 machine gun, uh, opened up on the two boys on the right, another M60 on the tower to my left. I immediately swept into position and used my M14 to, umm… to, umm… to shoot them. I didn't, umm… because by that time, the machine guns and others shooting from all over the base just literally, just literally ripped the two boys apart. The event was important for me, I think, in a lot of ways. Umm… my therapist described it and said, "Michael, you know, you were one person going up into the tower, but you are a different person coming down." Things had changed for me after that event. 

00:10:00
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN There is, uh, a myth that to get PTSD in military shows that you don't have the right stuff. 

00:10:10
PTSD is not a matter of a person's strength, moral character, willpower, or weakness. 

00:10:15
SCOTT No matter what happened the day before when you are there, the next day, you are going out on another mission. So what, you had to… Well, how can I say? You go, you got to go out and you got to be 100% in that next mission no matter what crazy stuff happened. 

00:10:35
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN We know that among our soldiers and Marines with PTSD, uh, they are the ones who are most sensitive to these stigma. 

00:10:45
MICHAEL And I remember the phrase, "It don't mean nothing", and that was something we vets said a lot, you know. Somebody would have a problem or something, "It don't mean nothing." 

00:10:55
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN If they were… if they go seek mental health, uh… treatment, that it's gonna ruin their careers or the people will think less of them. 

00:11:05
SCOTT Basically, life went downhill when it was diagnosed. Umm… if you were to ask me, I was too much in denial at that point. 

00:11:15
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN Real, real men, real soldiers seek treatment when they need it, not to jeopardize the, you know, they're trying to change the, the belief system. 

00:11:20
SCOTT After two years, maybe we are just starting to scratch, and some… That's how long it's taken may be even to get to there. You know, this is just like, what I am telling you today is just like sudden realizations. This has been all bottled up since, since coming home. 

00:11:40
Shame and guilt are common emotions associated with PTSD. 

00:11:45
LIZ You know, I felt that it was something I had done, you know, the classic. Was I be dressing seductively? Was I behaving seductively? 

00:11:55
LAUREEN I gave up on dating at 28, and then when I was… I turned 38, umm… my boss had stuck his hand up my shirt. And that just was the first physical contact I'd had with a man since I had been molested. 

00:12:10
LIZ There was a lot of secrets and silence about getting the help I needed, because, because it's a shame. 

00:12:20
KIM MUESER If a person is feeling guilty or ashamed, there is an underlying thought or belief that the person has done something wrong, or is bad in some way. 

00:12:30
LAUREEN I called a crisis center and they said, "Do you want to check yourself into the psychiatric ward?" And I'm like, "Yes, because something is wrong." And I needed help, and the only way to get help was to go into the psychiatric ward and talk to the psychiatrist. And I asked him, you know, "Why can't I stop crying? Why did this happen to me?" To me, it was such an overreaction to a minor thing, and my logical brain was going, "Well, you just completely overreacted to this tiny little thing." And he says, "You have PTSD." 

00:13:05
PTSD affects relationships, job performance and a person's ability to interact in society. 

00:13:10
KIM MUESER Having post-traumatic stress disorder can affect pretty much every aspect of a person's life. One of the common problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder is that they have very high level of anxiety that can be experienced throughout the day and that can interfere with the person's ability to get, to get to sleep at night. 

00:13:25
MICHAEL Person with PTSD has a significant effect upon those around them. And I know I did with, with my wife and daughter and family and friends. 

00:13:40
MARK MCGOVERN What I hear is that the people don't feel comfortable in their own skin, uh, that they lack of… a sense of safety and security. 

00:13:50
SCOTT So I fall down the stairs, it was really stupid coping… stupid stairs. Run in to a tree, stupid three. Yeah, I just get angry at whatever it was. 

00:14:00
MARK MCGOVERN You can imagine, you know, with that kind of, you know, high intensity approach to the world, uh, how stressful just a moment to moment, day to day existent might it might be. 

00:14:10
Cynthia 

00:14:15
CYNTHIA Michael and I met before he went to Vietnam. He went on to fight the war, and I marched against it. But we kept in, we kept in close contact. We were best friends through letters. So I had an idea of what he was experiencing in Vietnam. 

00:14:40
MICHAEL I believe I came out of Vietnam emotionally numbed and reticent to, to fully commit to relationships. 

00:14:50
CYNTHIA I remember just, kind of, following him around the house saying, "Well, how do you feel? How do you feel?" And now I know, he didn't feel. 

00:15:00
MARK MCGOVERN You know, people with PTSD are often so blocked and numb to feelings that they're unable to identify or articulate them. 

00:15:10
LAUREEN I didn't know how to even identify my emotions, and it's just… it took a long time to be able to put words with my emotions. 

00:15:15
LIZ I was very much aware that I needed to make some pretty significant changes in my life. I, at that point, at 21, had a daughter and I knew that in order for me to be a good, healthy parent to her, umm… I needed to stop my drug and alcohol usage, and I also needed to get help. 

00:15:35
KIM MUESER The most common thing to happen when somebody is exposed to a traumatic event is to experience, uh, many of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder immediately or within in a few days following the traumatic event. And that's completely normal. What then happens is that for many individuals, those symptoms gradually go away, over a month or sometimes over a longer period of time, uh, than a month. But then there is a another sub-group of people where those symptoms continue, and sometimes they even get worse over time. 

00:16:10
Symptoms of PTSD 

00:16:15
MARK MCGOVERN There are three primary symptoms that go long with the disorder. Uh, the first criteria, they are the re-experiencing symptoms, nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive memories, the thoughts that seem to come in out of nowhere. And a, a lot of physiological, uh, sensations when one has those thoughts are heart racing, uh, you know, sweating, umm… you know, palpitations, thing, things like that. 

00:16:40
SCOTT Oh, let's see, the basics, the nightmares. 

00:16:40
LAUREEN I was having nightmares every night about being chased and pursued. 

00:16:45
MICHAEL Basically woke up at the end of the bed, at the foot of the bed. A mortar hit, and I had seen the flash. Umm… and I've, I've, kind of, came to or, you know, woke up with my hands protecting my neck, umm… at the foot of the bed. And I was, I had leapt up now to look out the window to, to, to see how bad the explosion was. 

00:17:10
SCOTT Flashbacks, intrusive thoughts. 

00:17:10
LAUREEN Intrusive is right. You talk about getting a hold of a thought and not being able to let it go. And constantly, you're, "Oh, I am not gonna think about that." And three seconds later, it's back in your mind. And it's, it's not just this thought. It's the emotions that are attached to this thought that's causing you to be sad or to be anxious or to be fearful. 

00:17:30
LIZ There are certain smells, umm… there is certain music, there is certain environments that will trigger today lesser versions of some of that trauma for me. 

00:17:45
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN These people are hostage to their memory. So every time they recall what happened, the traumatic reminder, you know, they start having intrusive thoughts, the fear, the guilt, the shame. 

00:18:00
MARK MCGOVERN The second criteria are avoidance symptoms, so, you know, actively avoiding things that remind me of that traumatic life event. The avoidance of talking about it, avoidance of thinking about it, avoiding situations that might make me remember things, avoidance of people that were kind of like the person or who I was with at the time this bad thing happened, uh, avoidance of certain kinds of television shows, or books, or places that in any way conjure up those kind of memories or those thoughts. 

00:18:30
SCOTT They can call me Cleopatra, and I would deny everything. You know, avoidance is just… and I was the king of avoidance for a long time. And, uh… But it doesn't go away, in fact, it just gets worse. 

00:18:45
KIM MUESER People naturally avoid situations, thoughts, feelings that might evoke memories of that traumatic event. So if a person was assaulted somewhere, they might avoid the place where they were assaulted. Or if they were in a bad car accident, they might avoid driving. 

00:19:00
LAUREEN I was a very tightly controlled person, umm… and promiscuity obliviously was out of the question since I was doing the avoidance, and afraid of men. So… but avoidance has its own… it's it own problem in itself. I mean, how do you avoid touch? 

00:19:20
KIM MUESER And the third cluster of events is over arousal, people with PTSD demonstrate very strong symptoms or signs of physiological arousal such as increased heart rate, perspiration, they often have an exaggerated startle response. 

00:19:40
LAUREEN I had this hyper-vigilance type of thing, where any sound or, umm… motion would just make to jump, and I was just so anxious. 

00:19:50
MICHAEL I still have this automatic, umm… constant, umm… awareness of where are all the exits, uh, the… my choice of a seat in a restaurant or a public place. 

00:20:05
HOLLY Umm… all these reactions that you realize, you are experiencing involuntarily without any thought of… if I heard the sound of lighter, someone lighting a cigarette behind me, I just, I just jump. 

00:20:20
MICHAEL And I thought it was just a kind of a… just a quirky thing. But whenever I'm in a high place, a balcony, umm… walking along the cliff edge or anything, I always will have the sense of, "If I had to jump, how, where could I go and possibly survive?" 

00:20:40
HOLLY As illogical as it… as I may be mentally know it is, it still feels like the threat is real. 

00:20:50
KIM MUESER Those are the core symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. They have to be present for at least a month, uh, for a period of time, umm… and they have to interfere with daily functioning. 

00:21:00
Chapter Two 

00:21:00
Co-occurring Disorders 

00:21:10
KIM MUESER Depression is a very common comorbid disorder with post-traumatic stress disorder, it's the most common comorbid disorder. Often because people have a sense of loss, they've lost an important thing in their lives. And because of the fear associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid doing things that would otherwise be rewarding. 

00:21:30
LIZ Not only was I diagnosed with PTSD, but I also, umm… suffered from depression. Umm… I also suffered from anorexia for several years, and actually had attempted suicide on two different… two different times in my youth. Umm… and, you know, continued to suffer from some fairly profound depression. 

00:21:55
KIM MUESER It's very common for people with post-traumatic stress disorder to also have social phobia or panic disorder. They may also have, umm… other anxiety disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder. 

00:22:05
MARK MCGOVERN Many people will have tried a whole lot of different things before they think that therapy is an option for them to give a shot. And often, you know, therapy itself could be the last resort, because it actually involves another person. 

00:22:20
SCOTT Basically, I was dragged here by my wife who is a health professional, who saw that I was struggling, sat me down and said, "This is what's going on. I am dragging you down." And listed the help of everybody she could find, and get me help and, you know, I have been in treatment facilities ever since then. 

00:22:40
Substance Use Disorders 

00:22:45
MARK MCGOVERN One of the biggest challenges, uh, in treating addiction, uh, is that you are essentially, uh, advising a person to discontinue their use of a substance. And, and in advising them to discontinue the use of a substance, you are essentially, uh, asking them to give up their preferred coping strategy, the thing that they have been doing or using to manage their PTSD symptoms. 

00:23:15
KIM MUESER The prevalence of substance use disorders in people with post-traumatic stress disorder is generally agreed to be up… uh, around 30%. 

00:23:20
MARK MCGOVERN The substances that, that people typically use are ones that you might figure would work well. Those that numb or anesthetize or, you know, decrease that hyper-vigilance, if you will. So thinks that numb or anesthetize are things like pain medications including Vicodin, Oxycontin, heroin or opium. You know, last but not least, and probably most common is alcohol. 

00:23:50
LIZ I used drugs and alcohol to, umm… blat out what was going on in my life and, umm… and that was my means of escape. 

00:24:00
HOLLY I started drinking to deal with my marriage. 

00:24:05
MARK MCGOVERN All of these substances, uh, can take on that kind of maladaptive coping strategy. So when you treat the addiction, uh, it's often the case that you put the patient in a Catch-22 situation, asking them to give up something that's been working, not working so well for them. 

00:24:30
LIZ I think had I not been finding some means to escape what was my, what was my reality at that time, umm… you know, I think there probably would have been a reasonably good chance I would have committed suicide. 

00:24:40
HOLLY I continued to drink, I think, beca… in large part, because of not dealing with the post-traumatic stress disorder. 

00:24:55
LIZ Certainly, my, my drug onset, my alcohol onset very much coincided with when the sexual abuse started happening for me. And as the abuse escalated, as did my usage of drugs and alcohol. 

00:25:10
MARK MCGOVERN People with PTSD and substance use disorders, over the course of time and often over the course of time, and particularly without treatment, get increasingly isolated. So it, it… it becomes harder and harder to engage in relationships, and harder and harder to function in jobs. 

00:25:30
LIZ Well, eventually, the drugs and alcohol, you know, (inaudible ) did not work. And, umm… it only exacerbated the situation. So I mean, at that, at a fairly young age, I recognized that I needed to develop another means of coping. 

00:25:50
KIM MUESER We know that difficulty sleeping, in terms of getting to sleep, staying asleep and having nightmares, are very common in people with post-traumatic stress disorder. So some people will drink to the point of passing out in order to get some sleep. And that may work in the short term, but in the long run, it tends to back fire. 

00:26:05
Scott 

00:26:10
SCOTT Alcohol actually slows the recovery a lot . So when I made my mind up that I was gonna learn how to manage this, and that was it. 

00:26:25
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN If you, uh, if you take away that and don't replace it with some coping skills, you know, they are gonna go right back to where they were, even though recognizing how maladaptive it is. 

00:26:35
HOLLY I remember feeling a bit appalled that I was having so much fear, because it wasn't making sense to me. I am like, why now? Well, it's because I was finally sober long enough to really deal with what I, what I was remembering and what I was experiencing.

00:27:05
MATTHEW There used to be a, kind of, Catch-22 that… Let's take a person with PTSD and, and alcohol misuse, that the alcohol programs wanted the, wanted the PTSD cleared up before they would take them, but they didn't want them to be on any medications. And the PTSD people wanted the alcohol to be cleared up, they didn't want to have to deal with that. And so the patient was caught in the middle. 

00:27:30
HOLLY If you're, if you are clean and sober then you have a chance. Umm… if you keep using, it keeps you really stuck.

Dartmouth Medical School 

00:27:50
MARK MCGOVERN Roughly half of the people that we see don't know that they have post-traumatic stress disorder. And it was as if a light bulb would go on and they said, "Ah-ha! You mean the things that have been bothering me have a name, and that's the name? I thought you had to be a vet to have that disorder>" And it sort of, just, sort of, organized a whole set of experiences for them that made sense, and it was as if the diagnoses enabled there to be an increased possibility for a cure. 

00:28:15
Liz 

00:28:20
LIZ It was fairly early on into the therapy process that where… my therapist was identifying that, kind of, at the core issue were some of these more traumatic emotional difficulties that I was having, that it was really, kind of, umm… The origin lie in the sexual abuse that had been taking place earlier in my life. Umm… And it was, kind of, a… there was a part of me that there was a sense of relief. 

00:28:45
Kim Mueser Ph.D. 

00:28:45
Professor of Psychiatry 

00:28:45
Dartmouth Medical School 

00:28:50
KIM MUESER Many people are relieved to learn that the experience that… experiences that they've had, such as re-experiencing the traumatic event, nightmares, difficulty sleeping, avoidance, that those experiences are actually part of a syndrome, a psychiatric disorder, that quite a bit is known about and for which effective treatments exist. 

00:29:10
LIZ Well, okay, there is an explanation to this, But by the same token, it also kind of fed that, "Well, I really am crazy." So it was a little bit of a mixed bag, but as I learned more about, umm… this syndrome, that I was aware that it was, it was something that was curable and that there was hope with it and was going to require work. Umm… but that I could have, you know, eventually evolved on the other side of this. 

00:29:40
Michael 

00:29:40
MICHAEL It was really important for me to find… to, kind of, finally recognize and admit to myself that I had PTSD. And it's like, you know, "Hey, I've got a disease? Guess what? There is a cure and… or at least there is a treatment, and there is people who are really good at it and could help me." 

00:30:00
HOLLY And sometimes you have, you have to ask, unfortunately half a dozen, may be a dozen times, may be more, but you have, you have to tell somebody what's going on or nobody can help you. 

00:30:15
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN There are medications that work, two of them have FDA approval, they are both SSRIs. 

00:30:20
MARK MCGOVERN Specific serotonin and re-uptake inhibitors, and there are a handful of medications that are approved and they seem to work reasonably well. Uh, they target the depression and anxiety symptoms that, kind of, come along with PTSD. 

00:30:35
HOLLY I have taken, umm… an anti-depressant for, umm… quite a while now. And I think that definitely helps my mood stay sober. Umm… I think it at least takes the edge off some of my anxiety. 

00:31:00
MARK MCGOVERN The downside is that people need to teek… need to keep taking the medications in order for the, for them to continue to work. If they stop the medications, what we know is that the symptoms return, I wouldn't say with a vengeance, but return to whatever they were before the medications were started. 

00:31:15
Talk with a doctor you trust to decide if you need medication. 

00:31:20
KIM MUESER There are two different approaches, psychological approaches, to the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. One approach is an approached based on exposure therapy. Now the idea of exposure therapy is that people avoid situations, thoughts or feelings that remind them of their traumatic events. 

00:31:45
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN By re-exposing them to the traumatic reminders in the safety of the therapist's office and reminding them that a memory can't kill them, a memory can't rape them, uh, and it works. 

00:31:55
KIM MUESER A second approach is cognitive behavioral therapy, or the use of flexible thinking or cognitive restructuring. 

00:32:05
Chapter Four 

00:32:05
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 

00:32:10
MARK MCGOVERN Cognitive behavioral therapy, in general, really looks at the relationship between the situations, the consequent thoughts or beliefs and the behaviors, you know, the end of the line kind of consequences, and kind of tries to challenge those beliefs which are seen as kind of the linchpins to the behaviors. 

00:32:30
MATTHEW J. FRIEDMAN We got plenty of data showing that people, uh, with PTSD have what we call "erroneous cognitions". Some of the erroneous thoughts are, you know, "It's all my fault that so and so was killed." "You can't trust authority." "God is dead." "I am, I am no good." And these are kinds of feelings and thoughts, uh, or bel… which have become beliefs that were not present before the traumatic episode. 

00:33:00
MARK MCGOVERN We want to change those, change those thoughts so that may be, you know, we can change the behaviors, that's changing the things we can so, so to speak. So, uh, the CBT, particular CBT approach that, uh, we are talking about here looks at a functional analysis of, of behavior that could be related to PTSD symptoms or substance use symptoms, or really any negative emotion. 

00:33:25
LIZ And there were some memories that I had repressed, and it was going through the therapy process or therapeutic process that I really had a better understanding of the whole situation. And, umm… which helped me then marshal my forces, you know, with the help of a therapist and with being in sobriety, that I can actually start making some headway. 

00:33:50
MARK MCGOVERN In the beginning of the, of the treatment, we really try to talk with the patient about what, what they are doing with us and what might bring them to us. So we really want to focus in on, uh, the symptoms they are having or their, their feelings or their thoughts about things like their substance use, and really examining how their substance use either doesn't or does get in the way of their life goals. So we really kind of start off with the goals. 

00:34:15
Laureen 

00:34:20
LAUREEN I went into therapy with the idea that I was going to be intimate. I am like, "Okay, I want intimacy, I want the ability to be able to be intimate with a man." It ended up coming down to my therapist says, "No, I want you to have choice, I want you to have choice to say yes or no." 

00:34:35
MARK MCGOVERN The good news about CBT is that it's effective, that the effects are durable, that it gets at the cause and the solution at the same time. Uh, I don't know that there are any other treatments for PTSD that, that do all of that. 

00:34:50
KIM MUESER The core components of the program can be divided into three different parts. One part is the teaching of mindful relaxation. The second part of the program is providing basic education. Then the third part of the program has to do with flexible thinking. 

00:35:10
Mindful relaxation 

00:35:15
KIM MUESER Mindful relaxation involves helping people develop a number of different skills, such as centeredness and relaxation breathing, that enable them to deal with strong feelings of distress and anxiety in particular. 

00:35:30
LIZ The therapist I was working with was, umm… very, umm… extensively trained in working with people with post-traumatic stress syndrome. And so we used the relaxation, umm… techniques. 

00:35:45
SCOTT Breathing technique is the basic one, that's the first one you use, uh, because well, technically, as the medic knows, is you do that chest expansion and everything else actually brings heart rate and your blood pressure down, so… And which in turn relaxes you. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Alright. Well, Liz, good to see you again. How are you doing this week? 

00:36:10
LIZ It's better, it's been a better week. Umm… not quite as anxious as I have been feeling over the last few weeks. So I see this as a step in the right direction. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Well, good to hear that. Umm… have you been working on your breathing at all? 

00:36:25
LIZ I have been practicing it somewhat. I've not been completely regular in my practicing, I haven't. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:36:30
LIZ But I have been utilizing it and it has helped. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Good, good. So why don't we start off today with doing a little mindful relaxation, and just get you centered and do a few of the breathing pieces, okay? So why don't we start off with getting centered, if you want to get your feet planted firmly on the floor and work on finding your center, somewhere between you navel and your diaphragm, and just really get settled in there. Shoulders up, okay. And let's practice the breathing, if you want to do a short breath in through the nose, and a long breath out through the nose. 

00:37:20
MARK MCGOVERN The reason we bring in mindful relaxation as early on as we can is because we want to give people a proven technique to help them manage anxiety. So we try to help people to learn how to that early on, uh, recommend that they do it a couple of times a day. Uh, we start off every session with a mindful relaxation, so that if they are not doing it at home between sessions, they will at least do it with us. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Okay, how's that feeling, Liz? 

00:37:50
LIZ I can feel myself already winding down. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:37:55
LIZ Yeah, good feeling. The stress just, kind of, starting to flow out, so… 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Good. 

00:38:00
LIZ Yeah, it helped… 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Alright. 

00:38:00
LIZ A lot. 

00:38:05
KIM MUESER The second part of the program is providing basic education. People with post-traumatic stress disorder usually avoid talking about their symptoms and their traumatic experiences. So in the educational component, what we do is we give people basic information about the nature of post-traumatic stress disorder, the symptoms that are used to define it and common associated problems related to having the disorder. 

00:38:30
SCOTT And that's part of the thing is educating, yeah, educating yourself about it. But, you know, it's not, it's not a thing to be ashamed of. I mean, it's one of those things that just happens. 

00:38:45
MARK MCGOVERN We feel that the more information a patient has about the disorder and the treatment, that's best for them, the better they are gonna be, the more they are gonna want to be involved and play an active role in it. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN So last week when you were in, you were feeling really anxious, overwhelmed, really, kind of, having that hyper-arousal going on. 

00:39:05
LIZ Yes. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN How are you doing this week with that? 

00:39:10
LIZ Better, it feels to be a more muted… 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:39:10
LIZ Form of it, I am still aware of, kind of, the internal, umm… expression of it. But I am better able to short circuit it. 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:39:25
LIZ Before it, kind of, starts taking on a life of it's own. But it's still there. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN So you're still having some of that physiological response to triggers, to stressors, things that bring up that anxiety. 

00:39:40
LIZ Yes. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Okay. And that is really common with what you are going through. And I know we have talked before about the PTSD and how it relates to the addiction. But some of the common symptoms are that hyper-arousal, also, avoidance of people and places and things. And then another common one that I know we've talked about and you've been struggling with is those flashbacks, or those nightmares, those pieces coming out where you're, you know, back in that trauma. 

00:40:15
LIZ Yes. 

00:40:15
KIM MUESER What we find is that by educating people about the systems of post-traumatic stress disorder, and helping them identify which of the symptoms that they have been experiencing, they realize that they are not crazy, that they are not alone in their experiences and that this is a well understood disorder for which effective treatments exist. 

00:40:35
MARK MCGOVERN The patient education piece, piece turns out to be normalizing, it turns out to be empowering, you know, it demystifies something that otherwise was, you know, mysterious and, and dangerous and unknown. 

00:40:45
KIM MUESER Then the third part of the program has to do with flexible thinking. This is something that's also sometimes called cognitive restructuring, and sometimes the term cognitive behavior therapy is also used to refer to this. 

00:41:00
MARK MCGOVERN Flexible thinking really enables people to, kind of, cognitively reprocess a lot of the thoughts and feelings that continue to drive their PTSD symptoms. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Alright, Liz, so let's talk about what's happened in the last week since I saw you. Umm… anything new come up, any, uh, new events or situations that had brought up some of those upsetting feelings, the anxiety? Yeah? 

00:41:25
LIZ Yeah. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Tell me what happened. 

00:41:30
LIZ Oh, I was, umm… at a play. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:35
LIZ And, umm… someone sitting in my very close proximity just reeked of manhattans, you know what, whatever, and for me the smell of manhattans definitely triggers the original event back for me. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:42:00
LIZ Umm… just… as that odor, kind of, came wafting over me, it was I again just this visceral, umm… response to it and, and literally, it was everything I could do to just… I was aware that I had to hold on to the, umm… armrest… 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:42:20
LIZ So that I didn't just run out of the theater. 

00:42:25
KIM MUESER The flexible thinking part of the program refers to, first of all, helping people understand that when they're having upset feelings, there are thoughts and there are beliefs that underlie those upset feelings, and those thoughts and beliefs may or may not be accurate. 

00:42:45
MARK MCGOVERN Flexible thinking is a really a five-step approach to helping patients to develop new ways of thinking about situations, and new ways of dealing with their thoughts and, uh, developing new way of feeling and behaving. So it gives them a little bit more… a few more options. The, the five parts of it are, umm… you know, defined by the first five letters of the alphabet. A, for activating events, umm… B, beliefs, C, consequences, which could be feelings or behaviors, D, disputing the thoughts that led to those, uh, consequences. And then E, uh, entirely new thoughts or beliefs based on an evaluation or a re-evaluation of the evidence for those thoughts or beliefs. A, for activating events. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Okay. So then we're going back to the activating event that set this all off, was that manhattan smell. 

00:43:45
LIZ It was the Manhattan smell. Yes. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:50
Activating event = manhattan smell 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN So it sounds like you had a really strong physical reaction, in addition to having an emotional reaction. 

00:44:00
LIZ Yes, I did. 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN So that set off that past trauma? 

00:44:10
LIZ It did, umm… You know, with the, umm… the sexual trauma that I experienced, the person had been drinking manhattans. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:20
LIZ And so I just kind of correlate those two things pretty strongly. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN So that sense, that smell really brought you back. 

00:44:30
LIZ Yeah. It triggered the trauma again for me. 

00:44:35
MARK MCGOVERN The B is the belief, and what we find is that thought or belief is often, uh, you know, just that. It's not a fact. It's based on, uh, scant evidence, uh, it's based on, you know, the kind of thinking that, umm… you know, is really not well developed. 

00:44:50
LAUREEN I have all of these beliefs in place from what happened, and as they were happening, as I was eight or nine, I put this belief in place, and I took that belief into adulthood, and that's what was interfering. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN So when those two pieces were going on, you are having that manhattan smell, that, you know, triggers all those memories, triggers that physical reaction, that PTSD, what was the belief at that time? 

00:45:20
LIZ That the perpetrator was around me again. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:25
LIZ It meant I associate the smell with the perpetrator. 

00:45:30
Belief = I am in danger now 

00:45:35
MARK MCGOVERN The C is the consequences, which could be feelings or behaviors. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN You have talked about that real intense reaction, physically, you know, "I am gripping the seat." 

00:45:50
LIZ Yeah. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN "I am doing everything I can to not run out of here." 

00:45:50
LIZ Yeah. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN You were talking about just feeling overwhelmed, the breathing got tight. 

00:45:55
LIZ Yes. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN That anxiety started building up. So what part is that? 

00:46:00
LIZ Umm… kind of the consequence, I really think. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. That consequence of that intense emotional reaction. 

00:46:05
LIZ Yeah. 

00:46:05
Consequence = Intense fear and anxiety 

00:46:10
MARK MCGOVERN The D is disputing, you know, evaluating the evidence and thinking, you know, "Have I distorted the evidence in any way to leave me to an erroneous conclusion or at least a, you known, a shaky conclusion?" 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN So that sounds really intense and very real for you. 

00:46:30
LIZ Yeah, yes. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN What helped you get to that next step? 

00:46:35
LIZ Umm… Well, first, not running. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, okay. 

00:46:40
LIZ Umm… and, you know, I did do some breathing. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:46:45
LIZ You know, I, I made a point of trying to relax my hands and just, kind of, doing a reality check that, you know, the perpetrator is out of my life. You know, so just because I am being exposed to the, the smell of a manhattan, does not then translate into the perpetrator is in my space again, umm… and which is kind of challenging. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Okay, so you did D. 

00:47:15
LIZ I did D. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN You did D? 

00:47:15
LIZ I did D, yes, I did the disputing. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Disputing the evidence. Umm… and challenged, okay, you kind of look around, "Is the person here? Nope." Uh, okay, that's another person that's been drinking the manhattans. 

00:47:30
Disputing = I am not in danger 

00:47:30
MARK MCGOVERN And then E, entirely new thoughts or beliefs based on an evaluation or a re-evaluation of the evidence for those thoughts or beliefs. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN What was that entirely new idea that you came up with after going to that process? 

00:47:50
LIZ That, you know, I'm gonna probably be running into people who drink manhattans. And that doesn't have to be a trigger for me anymore. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:05
LIZ Umm… and, umm… I was safe, you know, most importantly, I was safe that, you know… 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Say that one more time. 

00:48:10
LIZ Because the smell was there… I was safe, and that was a huge. You know, I wasn't going to be attacked. And interestingly enough, once I got to that place about "I am safe", I was able to actually enjoy the rest of evening. I was able to kind of compartmentalize that event and, kind of, put it aside and go on and enjoy the rest of the evening. So it didn't, kind of, take over, you know, the rest of my night… 

00:48:45
KIM MUESER Post-traumatic stress disorder programs based on cognitive behavior therapy, umm… go from about 12 to 16 weeks. The majority of that time is spent teaching flexible thinking, about three quarters of the time is spent doing that. Initially, teaching it as a skill that people can use on a day-to-day basis for dealing with upset feelings. And then eventually, using that skill to get at trauma-related thoughts or beliefs that are responsible for the post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. 

00:49:15
MARK MCGOVERN Even at follow-up, you know, after treatment has ended, three, six months post the ending of treatment, the symptoms continue to improve. So unlike medications, the effects are, the positive effects are a bit more durable and lasting even, even after the discontinuation of the therapy. 

00:49:30
KIM MUESER What we see is that the impact of this program on depression is just as strong as its impact on post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. And that's really interesting, because of course, we're focusing on post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. But in fact, when we're teaching flexible thinking, that is the skill that can be used for dealing with any upsetting feeling, including depression as well as anxiety, and guilt and shame and feelings of anger. 

00:50:00
Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most effective treatments for Post-traumatic stress disorder. 

00:50:10
Chapter Five 

00:50:10
Hope and Healing 

00:50:10
Liz is living in recovery from trauma and addiction. 

00:50:15
LIZ It really comes down to seeking out help, seeking out professional help, umm… having a good support system, umm… for people who are also in a recovery program to, you know, use their sponsor, sponsor actively. Umm… but I think, you know, again whether you are male or female, there is hope. And I think, for a lot of us in those early stages of it all, you are not, you are not feeling very hopeful. Because it is a long process, it's a very long process in the healing, you know, to be honest. And, umm… you need to have support in place, you know, to kind of keep you moving forward, and a good therapist. 

00:51:05
Holly recently celebrated her one-year sober anniversary. 

00:51:05
HOLLY Physically, I feel better. You know, spiritually, I am growing. I feel like I am living again. Umm… it doesn't mean that everyday is easy or that there aren't minor setbacks, but they're things that I know that I can deal with because I have, I have support. 

00:51:25
Laureen is planning to publish her memoir. 

00:51:25
LAUREEN And I hug my brothers and sisters now when we see each other and when we leave, and that was something that never happened. And people can come up behind me and put their hands on my shoulders as they are moving past, and I don't think, "What was that about?" So that is the freedom that I was looking for, and I can now date a man without wondering what he is thinking, umm… We can touch and kiss without there being, umm… interfering images in my mind that takes me back to the trauma when I was eight or nine years old. 

00:52:05
LIZ I do talk to women today who have experienced what I've experienced and have been able to go back and say, "You do get to reclaim your life." And I think that's really a powerful message, it… you know, to, to help them discover their own strength and their own empowerment. 

00:52:20
Scott is helping vets from Iraq and Afghanistan. 

00:52:20
SCOTT But there was hope that, you know what, just take it in little chunks. Work on this one thing. And then when I started seeing some quality of life improvement, then I started getting into the program and work harder. And what you see here was someone going what I would describe as a bowl of jelly on legs, to someone that can… At least talk to you. 

00:52:50
Michael is an author and has been married for 35 years. 

00:52:50
MICHAEL Through therapy, I was able to, to, umm… bring in, bring in and, uh, a more empathetic understanding me. 

00:53:00
LAUREEN In therapy, it was really like a light at the end of the tunnel, that I could be this person and, because I could see her so clearly in my mind. I really saw this coming back to who I was before I had this trauma, to this beautiful whole person. It's worth the journey. 

00:53:20
MICHAEL I come away, I think from this whole integrated experience as, like I said, more genuine, more whole, more compassionate and softer, umm… slower, easier, easier going. And life is richer.
