MICHAEL MUNION My name is Michael Munion. I'm your moderator of this morning for a dialogue between two luminaries who, who genuinely don't need any introduction. We have Claudia Black who is internationally renowned for her, her writing, for her workshops, for her teaching and of course for clinical practice. We have Dr. Daniel Amen who is, is equally, ah, renowned for his work in brain imaging. Ah, we're gonna have a dialogue this morning. We will, we will, ah, make their comments and, and we will be in awe. Please join me and welcome them.

CLAUDIA BLACK Hello. (inaudible ) needing for a second I want to say hi, my name is Claudia B. but, uhm, some of you will appreciate that. That is if you don't know what I'm talking about. Hi, I'm Claudia Black and I'm actually gonna begin our dialogue today but before I do that I wanna say what an honor it is for me to be with you Dr. Daniel Amen and It's an-- one I followed his work for many years now and we first met personally approximately about eight years and I think his work is profound and absolutely ground breaking and so important to not just the field of addictive disorders but field of mental health and behavioral health care. And so again, truly honored in which to be here. I also thought I would share with your that in our discussions, both Daniel and I identify as being inherently shy people. And I know that's probably difficult for many of you to believe but, ah, we do. And I think we also both identify Clifford(ph) and talked about it as we have a very strong need to please other people. So what that tells me is that out brains' probably doing the same thing this morning in terms of words lit up at the moment. I'm gonna begin by sharing with you a couple vignettes of the type of client that we're talking about in this dialogue. I have a woman that comes in to see me in a private practice. She's 34 years of age, she's two and a half year in recovery, in recovery for her substance abuse and typical if I'm not working with somebody in a detox situation. I would ask them fairly early on in that initial session if they could share with me what their growing up years were like and what Jam said to me-- none of their names are their real names. She said, "Claudia, if I were to describe my grown up years I would probably most accurately say we were the late night regulars." Now, working on the field of addictive disorders, when somebody says we were the late night regulars I often think of people who spend a whole lot of time sitting in bars very late into the night. But fortunately I kept my mouth shut because that wasn't what she go on to say. She said, "Claudia, we were the late night regulars. After local class, the emergency room. We were always going to the hospital emergency room. We went to the hospital emergency room the night mom dropped the bottle of gin or vodka and hit the side of her leg and split her, split her leg open. And then we'd have to go to the emergency room the night that, ah, she was doing dishes drunk but she's drunk most evenings and, ah, plate broke and sliced her arm wide open. Off we went to the emergency room. And then my parents would get in these very horrendous fights and one night she threw a salt or a pepper shaker at my dad. Split his forehead wide open and off we went to the emergency room." But then there was those nights that when you look back now in your childhood, you wonder why you didn't go to the emergency room when you probably should have gone. She was an only child. She was home alone with her mother this evening. She said I was in the back of the house and all of a sudden there was this horrific noise and it was as if there was a low flying airplane over the house. The house, ah, shuddered and then I heard the screaming and kind of-- more of an animal type noise. She said I made my way from the back of the house into the living room and that's when I saw my mother pitch through the plate glass window and hanging over this huge pieces of glass between the living room and the front porch. Now this is a nine-year-old child at this time. She said that noise that I heard sounded like an animal was my mother. She said there was blood everywhere, glass everywhere and I got underneath her and I tried to get her up and I just didn't have the strength. Now I'm bleeding, I'm crying, she's making this awful noise, I ran back into the house. I ran back into the house and I got my phone. I called my dad and I'm having the scream over the noise in the background. He screams into the telephone. You've got to get her back into the house so I got back out there one more time and she said, "I don't know where I found the strength." Well, we know where she found the strength. It was her adrenaline at that moment. With leverage she got a need for mother and she was able to pull her up off off these huge shards of glass and she got her back to the living room. Now, when you don't do the kind of work so many of us do, people would often say, "Well, what happened here?" But when you do the kind of work we do, what do you mean what happened then? This is just Tuesday night in this little girl's life and the truth is it could be a Wednesday night and maybe it is a Thursday night but the point being this is not that unusual of an occurrence for this little girl life simply will go on. Well, when Jam is 12 years of age, her mom dies from Esophageal varices, a direct result of her substance abuse more specifically her alcoholism. Jam will lived for the next six years of her life with a her single parent, alcoholic father because she represents 20% of children in substance abuse in homes. They have two substance abusive parents not just one. But life for those next six years would be more stable for her because her father's gone as far along in the progression as her mother has been. Life is more stable for that reason. Now that is also characteristic for women who are addicted compared to men who are addicted. Women will lose at the progression of their addiction at a much faster pace. Women are more apt to become physically sick more quickly than men will in the progression of their disease, ah, a phenomenon that we call telescoping. And women are more apt to die from their addiction earlier than men would die from their addiction. Women are less apt to reach out and ask for help and they are less apt to get help, again, compared to the male counterpart. So as I said, she'll live for these next six years with a single parent, alcoholic father. When she's 18 years of age, she leaves that family home and she actually moves into a, a college setting or university setting right here in Southern California. And when she does, she enters that college setting as a cocaine abusing bulimic. She enters that college setting already very steep in her own alcoholism and in the next couple of year you'll see a young woman is also very sexually promiscuous. And by her third year in this four year university, she's no longer able to continue in school and she becomes what we often referred to as a revolving door psychiatric patient. And for those next several year you see multiple diagnoses, you'll see multiple forms of treatment. And then one day in the very early 30's there's a very wise physician and he says, "you have a lot of problems." But he said, "The primary problem is you have multiple addictions and we need to see that you get treated for your addictive disorders". And he said, in the context of your addictions, you have had a lot of trauma and prior to your addictions you experienced a lot of trauma and ultimately you're gonna need to be seen for that trauma as well. And that's that point I would need her, as I said, two and half years into to her recovery process. Now, a little bit more briefly, let me share with you another scenario before I turn it over to Dr. Amen and that is Jake. Jake is 18 years of age and meet him in a treatment program. I meet him in a treatment program because for him the other choice was to spend more time in jail and he was given a choice so he came into treatment. He began his life with greater appearance of stability than Jam's life would begin but by the time he was on upper grade school he would report back in a conversation with me that that's when you really aware of his parents or you mean a lot. He'd hear them at night and he said it was at that time in their life they began to move a lot. He didn't understand why but the reason they were moving a lot is his father who was in the aerospace industry was losing his jobs as a result of his substance abuse. And then there would be that particularly fateful night when he was about ninth, 10th grade age that the family was together and there was a car accident. Dad was behind the wheel of the car in pair, Jake's mom would die, Jake and his sister seriously injured. When Jake's sister was released from the hospital, she was moved into the foster care system. When Jake was release from the hospital, he was sent home to live with his father who was the least injured of all and actually was only assessed in the context of the hospital. It didn't take much time before the streets would become his place of identity, his place of belonging where he would garner his esteem and as we would quickly come to recognize this also where we would see the criminal activity that would result in his being in jail and in juvenile systems before the adult court system. And in that period of time as well, his criminal activity very much enmeshed with his use of substances. At the point I have the opportunity to work with him. People ask, what do you think the prognosis is? 

00:10:10
DANIEL AMEN Not very good. 

00:10:10
CLAUDIA BLACK Not very good. And not very good because at this point we simply have a young man who's trying to be the system. So let me say that these two scenarios represent so much of who it is we're working with when we work with people impacted by addictive disorders. In this case, both of these people are addicted. In this case, both of these people, young people are trauma survivors and in this case, both of them were raised in substance abusing homes. Now, in no way to lessen Jake's situation I also wanna the complexity for Jam's situation, terms of the fact that she as I said represents 20% of kids in substance abusing homes and that she will have two substance abusing parents which typically means far greater deprivation, a far greater lack of, ah, not just emotional abandonment but physical and sexual abuse is gonna be more prevalent when people come from such homes. Also, she was an only child. Now, for any of you who are only children there's advantages and disadvantages to being an only child. But when you're raised in a shame based family, when you're raised in an addictive family, typically those advantages fly out the window. And what Jam does not have that so many other kids have that can find helpful in spite of the dynamics of an addictive family system is she does not have the buffer of siblings that they will often provide. So with that, I'm gonna turn it over to Dr. Amen for a few minutes. 

00:11:40
DANIEL AMEN Oh my goodness. So I first heard of Claudia's work when I was an intern at Walter Reed in 1982. You just had a new book, ah, Adult Children of Alcoholics. I was in a marriage and was awful and - 

00:12:05
CLAUDIA BLACK The book or the marriage? 

00:12:05
DANIEL AMEN - I'm always trying to figure it out. 

00:12:10
CLAUDIA BLACK The book or the marriage is awful.

00:12:10
DANIEL AMEN Marriage, ah, the book was amazing and so I showed the book to my wife and she's like, "My dad wasn't an alcoholic." He beat her mother regularly, sent her to the emergency room. I mean, there was like nonstop drama and I had actually become a psychiatrist because four months after we got married my wife tried to kill herself and I dragged her off to the department of psychiatry going, "I think that's where you need to be." And I fell in love with her psychiatrist cuz I realized if he helped her, that would help me and help the children and even the grandchildren. And he did but there was always something missing and when I read your book it was just, "Oh my god!" And so I got so interested and then the pa-part I got really interested in was what is the impact of growing up in an alcoholic home on the grandchildren because I realized now all of a sudden that the time in 1982 I had an adopted child and we had our first child and so I'm thinking, what does the emotional storms in a child of an alcoholic do for the grandchild. And what we found in the research that we did is that they tend to inherit very high incidence of ADD in the boys and a very high incidence of OCD, OCD spectrum disorders in the girls. And so, uhm, if you know much about my work, I'd, I'd look at types of depression or types of ADD and there' is this one type that keeps coming back to us which we call it over focused ADD where they have both obsessive features and impulsive features. So we sort of called it an impulsive-compulsive disorder and if I get that history, my first question is tell me about alcohol abuse in the family. When I'm thinking of the girl that you were describing, nonstop drama. And so, all of you should know about this very simple neurophysiology principle called kindling. So kindling occurs. So if you take a nerve cell and you pass an electrical current through it, well, at low voltage not much happens but as you raise the voltage, pretty soon the nerve cell will fire off. And if you keep the voltage high enough, long enough, pretty soon the nerve cell becomes kindled and you can start to lower the intensity and it will still fire off. So, no question drama, drama, drama. Resetting her nervous system to a higher level and so and so many years later, her own child can give her a disgusted look like I get from my 10-year-old not that uncommonly. You know, she'll roll her eyes at me and for me I just go, "Well, she's 10." But for the mother who's been traumatized it can cause an explosion. And so I have some slides, uhm, this is the imaging work we do at the Amen Clinics. So the image on the left is looking at the outside surface of the brain. Image on the right is looking at the active areas. Typically they're in the back why the cerebellum has 50% of the brain's neurons. Uhm, the image on the bottom left actually reminds me of the man you were talking about and the most important thing in that story for me was the car accident because your brain is soft. The consistency is soft butter, your skull is really hard. Yes, you can experience a lot of emotional trauma but you're in a car accident that kills your mother, odd are what was going on inside your skull wasn't a good thing. And so not only do you end up with emotional trauma, you also have physical trauma. Now, the girl you talked about reminds me of the scan on the bottom right were it's just way too active because of the chronic past trauma. And if you have brain that's really busy, well pot makes you feel better and alcohol makes you feel better and painkillers make you feel better. And you also said she was bulimic. And what we see in the bulimic brain, impulsive compulsive, is they have low activity in the underside of their frontal lobe so think of your frontal lobes as the brain's break. It stops you from saying or doing stupid things. And then the compulsive part of our brain, the Anterior cingulate gyrus works too hard and when you get both of them together, it's usually due to low levels of both serotonin and dopamine. And so, if you do one intervention, you upset their brains. Or if you just put them on an SSRI which is very common for bulimics which you often do accessorized calm down brand. But if the underside of the pre-frontal cortex starts low, you calm it down and you disinhibit them. I can't tell you the number of bulimic women I've treated. Somebody put 'em on an SSRI and they became hypersexual or they started to make really bad decisions. So what they need is actually a little serotonin and a little dopamine. Of course, if you never looked at the brain, how would you know, it's Russian Roulette. Uhm, I got really interested in imaging. I was the director of a dual diagnosis unit. I s-- I brought-- so here's, uhm, the real reason not to use drugs cuz they damage your brain. And so, being married with a good brain is hard. Being married with a bad brain is really hard and so you image a couple where they're both substance abusers as is in the girl, you know, they're not gonna be having a good time which means that baby's going to be chronically stressed and end up with a kindle brain. Not the kind of kindle from Amazon. Uhm, so if you look at cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol, heroin. I mean, it really didn't matter that it's devastating and then so try to be an effective parent and if you have a child who has inherited because of the lineage, ah, tendency is to be ADD. Well, you know, ADD kids are conflict driven and they play this game called let's have a problem and what they typically do is they pick on the most irritable parent in their family and they work on them. And the parent yells and screams and hits and gets all crazy. And emotionally, the child hates that. But unconsciously they love it because they-- it's just worth 10 milligrams of Ritalin to have mom get crazy. And the first thing that I tell the parents to do is stop yelling because your, your chil-- child's Ritalin. You don't wanna be your child's Ritalin. So if you take someone who is unstable, who's drinking too much-- is the director when I was in the army of domestic violence at Fort Irwin. And what I often figured out-- yes, okay. The guy is a bad guy, right? I mean the, the perpetrator. It's easy, easy answer's is to always to call them bad but if you didn't evaluate the wife and the child, you might not understand the real brain dynamics going on. So prefrontal cortex often troubled in these people. Forethought, judgment, impulse control, organization, planning, insight, empathy. Have a couple of drinks, it goes away sort of like Jiminy Cricket in your brain. You know, your conscience and Jiminy Cricket, you get him drunk, he's not around. Uhm, ah, when it, ah, I'm, I'm not gonna do all these but I wanna show you this slide cuz this is that diamond pattern in the brain. So if you look-- so here, yellow is average activity, white are the active areas and you can see what looks like a diamond pattern and the top of the diamond is the Anterior cingulate people get stuck on things. And the basal ganglia or the anxiety center. Thalamus deep is one of the mood centers in the limbic brain. See, all of those active, so my senses, that's what the girl's brain would have looked like because of the chronic trauma that kindle her brain and that's where we really get excited about things like EMDR because we did a study that found that that settled things down and when you have imaging. Its-- now you have a road map on whether you do but notice so you have very biological studies so obviously you have to give everybody drugs. No, it's total nonsense, the biological study. But did you know that psycho therapy is a biological effect in the brain so, you know, the future of mental health treatment is going to include imaging. No question about it but it will not diminish the need for effective psycho therapy one bit. 

00:22:40
CLAUDIA BLACK I'm, ah, make some comments about trauma treatment in the context of addiction. sort of a comedian in terms of the value of the EMDR and it's not so-- and hope to take a moment to talk a little bit more about spouses and on partners in just a moment. And when I think about trauma in the context of addiction, ah, my mind did, ah, a quote that comes from a movie and a book and it's by Patrick Conroy. Who's the author of the book, ah, called The Prince of Tides and in the beginning of the movie you'll re-remember that it was Nick Nolte and who says, "I don't know when it was, that my parents began their war against each other but what I do know is the only persons that they took were their children." When we needed to escape we found a silent, soothing world, a world with no pain and that's what I think addictive disorders are about for so many people. I think that it is-- so we talk about our trauma responses, the fight, flight and, ah, the freeze that it's deserving for many people the fight, for some people the fight, and for some people the consequence of that freeze. When we think about trauma-- well, when I think about my early work around adult children of alcoholics, at that time we didn't use the language that we use in the trauma field today but what we were looking at was really the delayed behaviors that we saw in children who, so many of them had an ability to look good. I think that ability to look good was because from a family system's perspective they often to go with the roles of which it was very possible to see the strengths of those roles. The plausible to see of stability and to the family system but I also think the other dynamic was that by the time children in nine years of age in an addictive family system, they ask the addicted person often have their own denial system going on. And as I work with families I talk about, in this family do we tend to minimize, do we tend to discount, do we tend to rationalize. That was a little girl who said to me a long time ago. In our family, we just pretend things are different than how they really are and that's the language I'm more apt to use as I work with certainly younger people in this family. Do we pretend things are different than how they really are? So, the early work of the Adult Children of Alcoholics phenomena would really, in my perspective, subset some of the stage for-- as we begin to look at the big Ts and the little T traumas as many traum-- professionals refer to them in a context of addictive homes. Now, we learn very quickly my work let me not just to working around addiction but it quickly led me to working with the issues of physical abuse as in sexual abuses in the context of families. We know that if we wanna use the language of the big Ts and the little Ts I tend to use that with just more cute and are more latent versus that which is more subtle and more chronic as I there's still something diminishing or somebody is a little too over 50. But when I wanna think of that which is more blatant, some people think about as big Ts. We know that the substance abuse in families that physical abuse is three times more likely than non-substance abuse in the families. Three times! And Daniel already spoke to this he may have something more that he wants to say. When his physical abuse-- I mean the ultimate act of physical abuse is when somebody dies like in Jake's family, his mother dies. But from an abusive standpoint, how do these other people get tossed around in that car? When it comes to physical abuse I have to ask about the pushing, the shoving, the kicking, the pinching, the slamming somebody up against the wall until their teeth rattle. That is physical abuse. We also recognize, ah, how important the whole witness factor is. Nick comes to PTSD, we recognize, ah, that people who have PTSD at Vietnam when they first began to use the phraseology of PTSD and they actually were addressing dynamics of that, even in, in previous wars. But what they recognize, that with equivalent combat exposure, those people who were physically injured were less apt to have PTSD than those who were not injured. Now that is major ramifications to be the witness of that in the context of a family. Again, not only are people within this family system three times more likely to be exposed to physical abuse, blatant. They're also four times more likely to experience, ah, extreme forms of neglect. Daughters of substance abuse in homes are three times more likely to experience sexual abuse and subs-- and substance abuse in homes are four times more likely to experience sexual abuse compared to other males in non-substance abusing homes. But even that much more prevalent is the hand in glove goes with again, that which is more subtle and that which is more chronic. Again, I-- some people refer to as those little tease. We're talking about people who are raised at the time in their life in the chronic state of fear. In a chronic state of fear. The five years of age, 10 years of age, 15 years of age. Fear that comes with being the driver that is impaired, fear that comes with thinking that the parents are gonna stay together, the fear that comes with, you know, what's gonna happen when mom and dad shows up shows up at the school event in the terms of the potential for embarrassment and maybe even humiliation. Again, on a chronic basis at the time in their life when they're developing the sense of worth identity. And I think of-- I believe it is the, ah, national children's defense fund saying that goes, "Dear lord, protect me. My boat is so small and the sea is so wide." And that's what I think is happening for these children developmentally begin. As I said, the brain, the personalities, ah, their physical-- all of their physical entity is developing at the time in their life where they're being chronically impacted, ah, and fear basis of that. Another piece that I think of when I think of prominent context of the addicted families and that is the more trauma people have in their lives, the more apt they are to have multiple addictive disorders. Today in the field of addictive disorders and I am a senior fellow at the Meadows and some of you may know that but it happens to be a program that we certainly acknowledge this. And I think other programs are doing more so as well. But that we have to address underlying trauma. We don't see it as a-- as the primary issue that if you address the the trauma then you can go back to the normal use of whatever you're try, the choice was-- But that you recognize that once you become addicted it becomes his own primary disorder. But, to offer a quality of life and to offer a far less chance of relapse back to that predominant kind of choice we have to deal with the underlying trauma and you're gonna see lots of programs including your intensive outpatient programs and different residential programs. And as I, as I said at the Meadows, we do a lot of mindful practice today. We incorporate a lot of meditation opportunities in the course of treatment. Many programs are able to offer EMDR. Ah, we offer a lot of, ah, EMDR but certainly, uhm, the work of Peter Levine is Somatic experiencing. I think that-- again, and you're very specific trauma therapies are gonna be very important to this population. The children, the partners and the addicts as well. Ah, it seems like one thing if I had another thought, ah, okay, I'm just gonna switch back to also wanna go back to that multiple addictive disorders. There was a time where we felt that when people came to treatment they present with usually one addiction. That which there, for their longing progression with, naturally just causing the greatest crisis in their life. But today we understand because trauma is so prevalent there's far greater lack with it in multiple addictive disorders. That it is our job to asses for the possibility of others. Now, as I said, sometimes they're not all causing the same amount of crisis at the given time of admission but if in fact we do not look for the possibility is one of the greatest contributors to relax. When I think of relapse I think that have we been addressing the trauma. Have we looked for multi addictive disorders, have been willing to treat because today we know that we can treat them even if they're at different stages. And in this context as well, we have to address the co-occurring dynamics of your depressions and your anxiety disorders which are also very trauma based as well. 

00:31:15
DANIEL AMEN So I'm gonna s-sit while we talk cuz I want it to be more of a discussion. Uhm, so the thing I'm thinking about is these four circles I always think about; bio, psycho, social and spiritual. So there's very interesting question between alcoholism and gluten sensitivity. So, we're already talked about head trauma and we talked about ADD so think about those as biological. But what other biological things and one of the things that truly horrifies me is how addiction treatment programs feed their residents. 

00:31:55
CLAUDIA BLACK How they what? 

00:31:55
DANIEL AMEN Feed them. 

00:31:55
CLAUDIA BLACK Feed them. 

00:31:55
DANIEL AMEN The food they give them is crap and it's like how do you get well when your brain uses 25% of the calories that you consume. And so if they feed you-- like, like go to jail and they spend a dollar 88 a day on your nutrition. So what do they give you? High glycemic well fiber of foods are quickly turned to sugar and as you talked about relapse you know we talked about halts, right? Don't get too hungry. Why? Low blood sugar goes with relapse. Don't get too angry. Do you know if you have a negative thought it actually drops areas in your brain involved with processing speed and judgment. Don't get too lonely or tired because if you don't get seven hours of sleep at night you have lower overall blood flow to your brain. So, you know, when I think of a really great addiction treatment program. I'm thinking about planting the right diet, the right level of exercises, the cognitive rehabilitation, sleep strategies. Some of these crazy programs keep people up till three in the morning cuz they think they'll break down their psychological defenses. It's how to break down their brain, that's a really good thing. And then their insurance won't pay for anymore and then they have to leave. So, if we could do and, and we did this so my wife Tana and I planted, uhm, a brain health program including the diet into the salvation armies' largest drug treatment program here in Anaheim. It's 180 bid and the stories are just un-- unbelievable cool. But if you don't get the brain involved in your treatment and rehabilitating it, relapse is much more likely to happen. I mean you just have to think bio, brain and diet, exercise, psycho, psychological, social. And what I appreciate about addiction treatment field which is so-- almost antithetical to the psychiatric field, is spiritual. It's like why are you here? Why do you breathe? What's the level of meaning and purpose you have in your life so it's never brain is the answer or cognitive therapy is the answer. Social therapy is the answer AA or church. It's all of them, is the answer. 

00:34:30
CLAUDIA BLACK People get to their own healing and recovery process in a variety and different ways and that I think however people get there, that needs to be supported. It's my hope that whatever type of ongoing recovery program and I'm very much a believer in ongoing recovery practice. I think personally that the trauma the people have experienced in their life has been so extensive that people aren't cured and that at times of vulnerability if they didn't-- haven't continued their ongoing recovery practices, they will slip back sort of like eating well for a period of time and you need to go back to your poor diet again. And then what you're gonna see is that that brain isn't gonna be operating its ultimate level anymore. So, as I said, I'm a real believer in ongoing recovery practice and that as I said however people get there I apt-- So I have a little bias toward those programs but however people will get there I think it needs to be a recovery process of accountability. Self accountability is the recovery process, ah, greater honesty and when I say that I'm not sure that people are deliberately dishonest. I think that in many ways, because the company histories they have they don't, ah, they just naturally rationalize, minimize discount. Uhm, and don't have the capacity which will be which to be fully honest and that is something that is something that needs to be learned. 

00:35:55
DANIEL AMEN But we don't want they too honest. 

00:36:00
CLAUDIA BLACK No, uhm, too-- that's right. 

00:36:00
DANIEL AMEN There's a lot of my patients come in to my office and go, "Dr. Amen, I'm brutally honest and I'm thinking to myself that's usually not helpful." 

00:36:10
CLAUDIA BLACK I would say they scare the new(ph) health field in their honesty. But I do think again that-- and I agree with Daniel that the special component I think is absolutely essential. You know, these are people who've been medicating themselves, uhm, and looking for an altered state of consciousness for so much of their life and that, that when they find their own spiritual path whatever that is that truly is going to give them far greater meaning and certain far greater motivation in which to continue with this though. A process is about for them. 

00:36:40
DANIEL AMEN So, so, when I was young and in the army, uhm... 

00:36:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Younger. 

00:36:50
DANIEL AMEN Younger in the army, there is this really cute company clerk and so I asked her out. And she said, "Will you take me to church?" And I grew up catholic like, not kidding. Serious catholic. I'm like, "I can do church." And so I took her to what turned out to be a Pentecostal Assemblies of God healing service and it just frightened me because the nuns had always said god was a little irritable and you needed to be quiet in church and these people were like, screaming and crying. But she was cute so I went back and, uhm, I got involved with a group called Teen Challenge which is a Christian group that deals with drug addicts. And years later I figured out why it works. It has one of the best success rates. Well, the first thing they do is they give you a family. So they actually invite you and you stay in their home. And often as an addict your family has abandoned you. You know, and sometimes for pretty good reason. The, the second thing they do is they give you frontal lobes so they give you a bible and they say, "Rule book! This is what we live by" cuz that's your frontal lobes too. The third thing they give you and we miss this in mental health, is they give you a whole bunch of anxiety. Because they talk, start talking about hell and they're not kidding and they don't see hell as a far off place. Jesus may come back today. Are you ready, are you going to be left behind? And it's so interesting from a neuroscientist standpoint. these addicts often have low levels of anxiety so they have slower heart rates, lower sweat gland activity, lower frontal lobes. And so I thought when I became a psychiatrist, you know, I do hypnosis, I did that, love that bio feedback. They like, chill my patients out and when I realized for a group in the population particularly addicts, not necessarily the right thing to do because you need to give 'em a little anxiety so that they make better decisions otherwise they do the crazy things that you were talking about earlier. You know they can drive 125 miles an hour in the rain and not think about the consequences. And the scans I show when I show a damaged scan to someone. It's most of the time, you know, if you came to see me I'll go, "Oh, you have a beautiful brain, just needs to be tuned better." And I'm generally pretty hopeful and nice. For my addicts, I'm like, "This looks like shit." I'm like, you are damaging your brain and what I found-- it was that confrontational part, raising their anxiety, giving them brain envy, so helpful that many, you know, it's a 16-year-old teenager smoking pot, "Oh, pot doesn't hurt." I'm like, "Why did you bring one? Awful. It looks like it's 50-years-old." "So, do you think that's hurting me? You won't tell my mother right?" "No, we have to talk about it." 

00:39:55
CLAUDIA BLACK I think that we can give them some little bit level of anxiety. I also think that we need to give them purpose as well and, and that just your talking about that reminds me of many years ago my husband was challenged with a terminal illness from which he did survive. I forget to tell people that sometimes. But, ah, so what do you do when your husband has a terminal illness, he's not gonna live. We were often by the sailboat and we put it on a chart service and so we could sail as much as we could until he died. And, ah, but it was on the charter service and there was-- our captain told us one day, he said this one group of people got on and he said the first thing he noticed is that they didn't drink any liquor and they drink a lot of coffee. And he said, but they didn't seem to know how to have a good time. But our Captain Tim knew who we were and we had a big book on the boat. He brought the big book up but he brought it up with sponges and he put them all to work and he gave them purpose. And they just scrubbed the boat down for the next two or three days. They had the best little voyage the-- I ran into them many, many years later. They come and tell me how once they had something to do and they had purpose, then they could relax and then they could enjoy themselves. So, we'll raise their anxiety a little bit and give them purpose. We're gonna need to bring this to a close and I'll make comment. 

00:41:10
DANIEL AMEN Already? 

00:41:15
CLAUDIA BLACK Two already if my clock is right and then maybe you can make a comment and, and given the time, we won't take questions from the audiences. My clock is wrong then. Oh, good. 

00:41:25
DANIEL AMEN So let's take questions. 

00:41:25
CLAUDIA BLACK Really good. Okay, let's take some questions. 

00:41:30
DANIEL AMEN Let's take questions. 

00:41:30
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 #EVO2013 

00:41:30
CLAUDIA BLACK Yeah. What I get for not getting, ah, my glasses on. I'd love them with me. If you have questions go ahead and go to the microphone and we will take as many as we can and then we will conclude in the last five minutes. We'll take 'em up for probably about another 10 minutes and let's go head and begin with this woman and we'll repeat them. 

00:41:50
 Thank you so much for the inspiring talk. Uhm, I just wanted to ask, ah, Dr. Amen you said, uhm, drugs damage your brain. I'm in gambling addiction. Do you see, ah, any changes in the brain in gambling addicts too? Meaning is it just the substance damaging your brain or are there other processes going on? 

00:42:15
DANIEL AMEN No, I actually didn't hear that. 

00:42:15
CLAUDIA BLACK Uhm, ah, do other substances, other behavioral addictions damage your brain. She's a gambler. 

00:42:25
DANIEL AMEN Interesting. 

00:42:25
CLAUDIA BLACK And with compulsive gambling, how might you see that in a brain spec. 

00:42:25
 Think this... 

00:42:25
DANIEL AMEN So what we see in many addictions or what we call an impulsive-compulsive disorder. Gambling is perfect. You will often see high cingulate activity, low frontal lobe activity. So the act of gambling, what happens is it wears out your pleasure center so you are always seeking, ah, the next win if, if you will. It's not physically as damaging as smoking pot or drinking alcohol or doing cocaine or benzos. Uhm, but the chronic stress that's associated with it has been shown to raise cortisol and then kill cells in the hippocampus, your main memory center in the brain which is a really bad thing for a gambler. Cuz if you're a gambler, you have to remember things and if the stress is going to make you worse overtime. Now, one tip if you wanna tip on how to do that more effectively is check your DHEA level because when DHA is a hormone that produced in your adrenal gland, when its low, cortisol shrinks your hippocampus but when DHA levels are healthy, cortisol is not as damaging. I never wanna teach someone to be a more effective gambler. What I would always say is don't go to Las Vegas because they have a down because what they do is they give you free alcohol. And then for guys, they give you a half naked woman in front of you. Both of those drop your frontal lobe so that's why the house has the edge, right? 

00:44:05
CLAUDIA BLACK Gentleman here. 

00:44:05
 Yeah. Just-- if you could please comment on the impact of the developing brain of preadolescences and adolescents in respect to, uhm, technology use. Ah, more specifically social media and, ah, their telephones, smart phone use. Ah, it's one of, ah, we've noticed is one of the predictors for violence whenever we use, ah, that as a consequence. Uhm, so if you could just comment if there is any additional or an impact on the developing brain of, ah, preadolescences excessively using technology. 

00:44:40
DANIEL AMEN So are you seeing more video game addictions? 

00:44:40
CLAUDIA BLACK Very much so. He was just asking for seeing more video game addictions or seeing increase-- I mean, we're seeing a lot of the video game addictions and what we're also seeing ultimately with that is porn addiction. 

00:44:55
 And it's so available. Right, as you increase the availability of an addictive substance its use goes up which is one of my concerns about legalizing pot all over the place. I'm not a fan. Uhm, but the developing brain is so interesting and Dr. Siegel who's here at this conference has a brand new book. He and I were talking about last night, brainstorms which is really wonderful and your brain goes through wild development from the time you're seven. So brain activity peaks at about seven. And then it begins to sort of become more molded and that actually you're not an adult from a neuroscience standpoint until you're about 25 if you're a girl and I hate this part. That's about 28 of you're a boy. I don't know why we're always behind, it's very irritating. But the process that's going on is two things, pruning so you begin to lose connections you don't use and myelinization where all your nerve cells become wrapped with a white fatty substance called myelin. My big concern with the over use of video games and texting and Instagram and Tumblr and all those is your brain is not yet developed, fully developed and it's being assaulted by nonstop pleasure. And so what I think is happening is you're actually wearing out the nucleus accumbens. So think of the nucleus accumbens as two little pleasure buttons deep on the underside of your basal ganglia and they wi-- they're what responds to cocaine or to Ritalin. Push out dopamine and you feel drive, motivated, and with cocaine, pretty happy. But the more you do it, the more you have these sort of these high impact, exciting activities that begin to become worn out. 

00:46:55
CLAUDIA BLACK This is a major challenge for any of you who are parents or you're working with people who are parents in terms of how to, to limit their children because of such, ah, a part of their culture where it hasn't particularly been a part of our culture. But healthy parenting will certainly include extreme limiting in terms of, ah, engagement in technology. 

00:47:15
DANIEL AMEN And that's what the American Academy of Pediatrics says. Limit TV, video games and, and I wrote an article recently for parent magazine and its kids do not just have this on their lap. So what they are, they're in front of the television with a smart phone and tablet. So they actually are working on multiple devices at the same time. 

00:47:40
CLAUDIA BLACK And they're taking it to bed and putting underneath their pillow as. One of the things that we know about prevention in terms of high risk behaviors is how important healthy rituals are in the context of families and that the researches has clearly shown that a family that eats together-- actually the research shows that the family eats dinner together as much as five times a week, it substantially decreases the likelihood of these high risk behaviors for kids being so much trouble. Well, I know you say that again at this time. Eating dinner five nights a week is a family, oh my gosh! Well, I'm working with people. They don't eat dinner together as a family two nights a week so let's just start with two. So let's not get too caught up with five but what they say is that you have, ah, the television off. Well, you don't just have to turn the television off, we have to turn all your cameras off, off-- all your phones off, etcetera. I also want to say-- and I hate to do plugs but I have reason to do this other than there are very few avenues for a treatment for people who actually become addicted in terms of the technology use and the video games that this person was asking about. But I recently visited program in Redmond, Washington. It's called the restart, R-E-S-T-A-R-T. It's one of the only programs and working with-- and the populations that comes into treatment as a very young adult, usually 18 to 25 years of age. But just like with any addiction, it will destroy every aspect of your life. And with internet addiction and people are getting addicted at a very, very young age, you'd find them severely lacking in their social skills in terms of being able to, you know, and are faced with their, with their peers. They're often very bright, uhm, but there are people who are very housebound in many cases, uhm, and oh, and fairly-- in literally every level of your life. And so we're gonna see more and more of this. The next question. 

00:49:25
 Hi. Uhm, I'm-- there's, ah, some treatments in Europe and now in Canada, well, some European countries that I should say, and in Canada as a, as a research project right now where people with severe, ah, opiate addiction are being offered heroine as a treatments modality. Basically going in for the-- ah, medically provided, ah, opiates, heroine are diluted three times a day instead of once a week. 

00:49:50
CLAUDIA BLACK Okay, let me stop you for a second because you're saying a lot so I wanna be sure I understand your question. 

00:49:55
 Oh, sure. 

00:49:55
CLAUDIA BLACK We're talking about treatment in other countries. 

00:49:55
 Yeah, well specifically in Canada right now. 

00:50:00
CLAUDIA BLACK And how specifically in Canada and how their option in using various forms of heroine as a part of the treatment process. 

00:50:05
 Yeah, a heroine assisted treatment program and it's been found so far and I, I work on it so, uhm... 

00:50:10
CLAUDIA BLACK It has been what? 

00:50:10
 I-It's shown to be working very well so far in terms of providing a stability in people's lives in terms of how we can get housing, eating well, access in counseling and psychotherapy. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on her-- on that kind of a treatment. 

00:50:25
CLAUDIA BLACK When you say-- so far it appears to be effective for what length of time does that demonstrate in itself, do you know? 

00:50:35
 So, so far I'm, anecdotally I'm speaking and about a year and a half - 

00:50:35
CLAUDIA BLACK Okay. 

00:50:40
 - treatment length. 

00:50:40
CLAUDIA BLACK I'll let you respond to-- on the brain perspective to that. 

00:50:45
DANIEL AMEN Actually your... 

00:50:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Okay, the question is - 

00:50:45
DANIEL AMEN I, I don't know. For some reason I think they're about my... 

00:50:50
CLAUDIA BLACK What do you think the effectiveness is, ah, uhm, really more of either or, ah, harm reduction approach to treatment and or in this case actually using various forms of heroine derivatives, ah, to help people in terms of stabilizing them up. 

00:51:00
DANIEL AMEN Yeah. I'm totally not a fan of heroine derivatives. It's like if opiates damage the brain, we mo-- methadone is an opiate and, and I just have a heck of a time getting people off Suboxone. So, I, I just-- I'm not happy - 

00:51:20
CLAUDIA BLACK Yeah. 

00:51:20
DANIEL AMEN - with-- are sort of added to-- toward what just keep the brain in the damaged state 

00:51:30
CLAUDIA BLACK And I would compare to, I-- just again, I think sometimes, some people find in a health form a very short term basis to use, ah, drugs such as Suboxone. Uhm, but only on a very, very short term basis and otherwise the fragment-- 

00:51:40
DANIEL AMEN And, and the problem is this 

00:51:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Heck a lot of people time getting off. 

00:51:45
DANIEL AMEN It's hard to be short term. 

00:51:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Yeah. 

00:51:45
DANIEL AMEN Because it's like get him off and they feel terrible. 

00:51:50
CLAUDIA BLACK It isn't necessary. Thank you though for your question. 

00:51:50
 Hi. I wanna say that I'm a fan and in awe of being in this room with both of you here. 

00:51:55
CLAUDIA BLACK Thank you. 

00:51:55
 Thank you for this experience. Gotta give you your just applause. Uhm, I am approximately 25 years in recovery personally and now an MFT in training and I would just like on tidbit of advice from each of you as heroes for my future, guiding my future as an MFT in training. 

00:52:20
CLAUDIA BLACK So, would you re-- you're asking for one piece of... 

00:52:25
 Of, just a piece of advice for me as a, as a... you know, coming into the world where we are now as a therapist. 

00:52:30
CLAUDIA BLACK Oh, wow. 

00:52:35
 You looked thrilled with that. 

00:52:35
CLAUDIA BLACK You know, the one piece of advice I have and I really try to live by, she was asking for a piece of advice as a person just coming into the therapy world and that is how important it is to take care of ourselves. And we all are very, very human and what that means is many times we struggle with many other things that the clients we work with also struggle with and right now I have a very different in my life. Who is a position and she has been a physician in recovery and she has studied relax after four years. And I say, "Right now in my life-- on the phone last night. I'll be on the phone again with her to say. I that ahem, a shame that she feels as a physician who understands addiction and even understands recovery." Resources and such can really ma-- I, I have a grave concern for the possibility of suicide. We feel such shame when we struggle, maybe in our relationships, may some of us. I mean we're in gru-- as you said, relationships are just-- inherently there's lots of challenges to them and, and sometimes they're gonna struggle for their own addictions and so many of us come from the kinds of histories that we're working with. So one of the pieces of advice I have is that you are deserving as the client that you work with. So what that means is there may be times that which you're gonna need some help yourself and, ah, to honor yourselves on the way you would honor your clients. 

00:53:55
 Love that. Thank you. 

00:53:55
CLAUDIA BLACK Well, Da-- 

00:54:00
DANIEL AMEN I really like that answer. 

00:54:05
CLAUDIA BLACK Ditto, ditto. Oh, help yourself. 

00:54:05
DANIEL AMEN Now, now let me take a little bit of a stab at it. Ah, if I was a young therapist in training, so I would not limit yourself to a theory or to a school of thinking. Is that-- I would really-- I, I always come back to these four circles. Is-- and, and I think all therapist, the organ you deal with is the brain. You need a basic course in neuroscience, uhm, and, you know, and we have some basic ones we really like for therapist. But you really want to get the biological piece including things like how food affects the mind. So-- and then so do the four circles and then, and I'm gonna tell you this and some of you aren't gonna like this. You have to live the message of your life. 

00:55:05
 Mm-hmm. 

00:55:05
DANIEL AMEN So if your message is mental health, then you need to practice what you teach because if you don't, you're not a good messenger. And that's wh... little piece of advice. 

00:55:25
CLAUDIA BLACK We're gonna take one more question. I'm sorry we can't take the others and we're gonna go with this woman. 

00:55:30
DANIEL AMEN Ah, that's a man you cho... 

00:55:30
CLAUDIA BLACK Actually, yeah, with this woman here. 

00:55:35
DANIEL AMEN Remember, that's a guy. 

00:55:35
 Uhm... 

00:55:35
CLAUDIA BLACK I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

00:55:40
 It's okay. About a couple... 

00:55:40
DANIEL AMEN He's from Malaysia. 

00:55:40
 Yes, I'm from Malaysia. 

00:55:40
DANIEL AMEN He's a troublemaker. 

00:55:45
 Just want to clarify with you Dr. Amen about, ah, how technology, ah, addiction affects the brain. You, ah, are you saying the-- it's, ah, slow down misselination-- ah, myelination because, ah, wouldn't that be a case of increased activities, uhm, that would then increase, uhm, connections in the brain as well. 

00:56:05
DANIEL AMEN So initially, when you're working on your video game or what have you, you're probably gonna see an increase. 

00:56:15
 Yes. 

00:56:15
DANIEL AMEN That Hewlett-Packard actually did a study. It's funny that they sponsored the study on addictions to computers, cellphones, text messages. And what they found over a year, people lost nine I.Q. points and if anybody heard me talk yesterday as your weight goes the size of your brain goes down, so if you're, you know, on these devices and eating chips and cookies and you end up-- and that's what happens with computer addictions. People end up over weight, depressed - 

00:56:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Over weight, and there's... 

00:56:45
DANIEL AMEN - and it's not a good thing. We did a study and one of my patients who was a video game addict and he'd actually get violent when people try to take him away. Well, we took him away, it's the first thing you do. But if we took him away for a month, scanned him, and then we scanned him again while he was playing. And for him, I don't think it happens for everyone but I think it happens for the subset of people, their brain actually goes into a violent state. So somebody might remember 1997 in Japan, there's a Nintendo cartoon on TV, that there's an explosion and it flashes red, yellow and white lights at four and a half cycles per second and all of a sudden, 729 Japanese children ended up in the emergency room with new onset seizures. So these, these things called photophobic seizures. So I think we've unleashed all of these technology on children with no neuroscience study. It's a bad idea. 

00:57:45
 But actually just last month someone died in, in Malaysia during a game, ah, it, it made a headline. And can I just... 

00:57:55
CLAUDIA BLACK I'm, I'm gonna stop because we do need to bring this to a close and we're getting some good hand signals but, uhm, one, we'll just make a couple of last minute comments. I really wanna come back to how important that addiction just doesn't belong to the addicted, it belongs to the family and that if we're serious about intervening with addictive disorders, that we really need to do whatever it is possible to get the family as involved in this recovery as possible whether or not as a substance addiction, an internet addiction, a sex addiction, a gambling addiction. I also wanna conclude my remarks that it is an absolute devastating disease. It is a, a terminal disease and it is maybe the most treatable terminal disease that I am aware of. And not only do people have the possibility in which to for the addicted person to learn to refrain from self defeating behaviors, they have the possibility in which to truly transform their lives which is also true for the family members as well. And, you know, I came into the field, I just total-- you don't want to work with, you know. They didn't think about families but you don't wanna work addicts. They lie. Well, you know, of course they lie. Well, you know, that's the nature of what they may need to do to keep that addiction going. But I've been around for three to five years doing this work and I gotta tell you I am in awe of I think of as the miracles of recovery. Thank you. 

00:59:15
DANIEL AMEN Well I have just had so much fun doing this - 

00:59:20
CLAUDIA BLACK I did too. 

00:59:20
DANIEL AMEN - with you. You - 

00:59:20
CLAUDIA BLACK Do it again. 

00:59:20
DANIEL AMEN - then one of my heroes for decades. I know it's sort of irritating now that we think we've been doing this for decades. It's irritating. Ah, this is a field where people get so much better. I mean, you just, you know, people already here so that I've been in recovery for 25 years. This is a treatable disorder and when you treat people within those four circles, ah, and please don't forget about the brain. Ah, people can get dramatically better. So thank you so... 

00:59:50
