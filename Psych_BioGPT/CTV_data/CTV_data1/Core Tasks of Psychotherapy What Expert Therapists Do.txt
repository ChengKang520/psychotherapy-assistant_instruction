What "Expert" Therapists Do

Donald Meichenbaum, PhD

DONALD MEICHENBAUM Well, thank you for those kind words and the opportunity to present. I'm always kind of curious, how many people in the audience are hearing me for the first time? A room full of virgins, I love this kind of --. With that in mind, let me just take the initial few moments to share with you the journey of how I got to this point and the nature of the topic that I'm about to present. As noted in the bio there, it indicated that I'm a Distinguished Professor Emeritus from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Waterloo is approximately one hour west of Toronto and what that title means about Distinguished Professor Emeritus is that my university was cut back by about $20 million and they brought in an early retirement package that I took advantage of. So, I'm actually a retired professor from the University of Waterloo who now lands airplanes in Orlando with this mike, okay? Now, what's really important about that title of Distinguished Professor Emeritus is that with it, after you've been there 35 years and have made some kind of distinctive contribution as they judge it, they give you this honorary title. And what's really important about that title is that with it comes free parking. No, do not make a light of this, okay? I have paid for over 35 years. Now for a moment, think like an administer of the university, because while on the one hand, they give you free parking. On the other hand, they take away all your offices. So, you get in free, but you have absolutely no place to go, okay? And you're part of this set of distinguished professors who equally excited about getting in free known as Alzheimer set, okay? Get the walker, we'll go for coffee. Now -- and now, if you live in Canada and you retire, one of the things you do with about 25% of the Canadian population is you go to Florida for the winter. So, you just drive to Detroit, get on I-75 and follow the tropism of Ontario plates like Lemmings back to sea, okay? And you get there and it would be really good if you can get here in September, so you don't miss any hurricanes, okay? Now, what takes me to Florida that's relevant to your day-to-day activities is not only am I escaping the winter, but I'm the Research Director of The Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention and Treatment of Victims of Violence and let me tell you a chad about this and its relevance to this presentation into your daily activity. Melissa was actually a young lady who grew up in Miami and was going to school at Washington University in St. Louis and a tragic thing happened. She was carjacked and brutally murdered. Now, when such a tragedy like that before an individual, their family, friends and the community at large, one of the ways that people cope with trauma and as you'll see this is a topic that I'm heavily involved in is people to try to transform their pain into something good that can come of it. So, they created this institute that I'm the Research Director of. Now, the institute does three things, just not a direct hands on institute in the sense of power shooting in therapist to provide services, but it does three things. The first that it does is it supports graduate students. I don't know if there are any here or you know of some in terms of the dissertations for the area of Violence Prevention and Treatment of Victims of Violence. When the joy is in my life is to give away other people's money, the things that I think are worthwhile and needy graduate students fit that particular category. So, you can go to the website of the www.melissainstitute.org and access the application form. The second thing is we do continuing education and training this kind of presentation. So, the Melissa Institute does in annual conference, we have one coming up on May 6, on resilience we've done conferences of domestic violence, on adolescent suicide, on resilience training and so forth. Everything that the Melissa Institute does is available that you could download for free. And in fact, we have a website called TeachSafeSchools, which is for educators and I'm really proud of the fact that those two websites since the initiation when I put them on have had over 3 million hits worldwide. So, I'm now 70 years of age and I'm into what Erikson calls the generativity stage. So, when I write an article, right? And I put it in a journal or in a book or something, I'm looking for 200 people to read it and half of them are my relatives, okay? So, now when I put everything up, it has the possibility of giving science away. The third thing that the Melissa Institute does that's relevant to this presentation is I do a lot of consultation. So, I go around and I'm involved in whole variety of projects. One of the major project is we are returning soldiers now from Iraq and Afghanistan in terms of helping them deal with the aftermath of the war. In fact, I recently presented at the VA Hospital in Miami on differential diagnosis between traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, which is very interesting complicated kind of issue. Oh, here is something kind of need, that's a forewarning of this presentation. I pointed out to them that one of the signature injuries, one of the signature injuries for soldiers who have been over to Iraq and Afghanistan is that they've been exposed to these intermittent explosive devices. So they now have traumatic brain injuries. Now, I always have more material to cover than I have time allowed to me. So, I'm on a role, I'm doing my kind of stick, okay? And I got like a whole, I do five days on this. They have given me two hours. I mean, it's ridiculous. So in my haste to get through in the material, I say to them. I'll tell you one of the problems that these guys have is that when they are over there, they are exposed to these exploding IUDs. Do you know what it's like to be sitting on an exploding IUD, okay? The sense, you know what this does to your sense of intimacy and trust, you know what the long term impact -- so inadvertently instead of saying IEDs, intimately I keep saying IUDs, okay? And the chief psychiatrist nurse comes over to me and says, can I give you a little feedback on your presentation? And I said sure, I'm always open to. And she says, you know, the problem over there is that they are not exposed to intermittent devices. That's not the thing that explodes. And I said what are you talking about? And she says, you said IUDs repeatedly instead of IEDs. And I said no way and the chief psychiatrist looked to me said five times. And I said, you know, this is a problem of mine. So, for example, when I presented at Brigham Young University, okay, this is the Mormon Church, okay? The Church of Latter-day Saints, the entire presentation I kept talking about, you know what happens if you are member of the LSD Church? This is like a spiritual high, okay? I mean it changes your whole outlook. So, I want you to know for the rest of this presentation, I do not intend to use abbreviations, okay? And that is really hard at a conference on psychotherapy because you cannot do psychotherapy unless you have an acronym, okay? Acronyms is a mandate. In fact, people create the acronym and then they create the therapies, okay? So, you have EMDR, CBT, DBT, IPT, okay? Okay, I can go through. I mean -- it's long as your arm, right? The challenge is that there is no differences in the outcome of all of those studies. So, the interesting question is I get called in to work with all kinds of diverse populations. I can solve that traumatic brain injury, I can solve that at VA Hospitals, I can solve at psychiatric facilities for children, adolescents and adults. I help people set up residential programs. I've trained all of the addiction counselors in the Province of Nova Scotia to deal with comorbid disorders. Now, I'm essentially an honest broker. So put yourself in my shoes, think about coming along with me and the key question is what therapeutic procedures would you advocate, what do you think the state-of-the-art is in terms of saying this is where you should put your money, okay? This is the nature of the training, okay. And one of the things that becomes really interesting is that we also know what -- the literature indicates are important variables. So I have two objectives in this presentation. The first is to share with you the work that we've done in a case conceptualization model. A clinician who does not have a case conceptualization model as the adage goes is like a pilot of a ship who just goes roding and he has -- he or she has no rod. So what happens for me is I go to these clinical settings and how do I earn my money, what is it that they are paying me to do when I get to these settings? So one of the things that happens is that when I'm there, I'm the occasion for everyone to get together and people don't even see each other. Oh, you still work here or we'll go for dinner, okay? And what they do is that they pick out the most difficult challenging patient family group that they have and then they're going to put me in a case conference, we have the psychiatrist, psychologist, the social worker, OT, PT, everybody who has involved, family, everybody who has involved in that case. And they're going to inundate me with information and then put me in the room. And they are all going behind the mirror. And what's going to happen is I'm going to get wiped out in the same way that they do, right? And they're going to go, ah!, look at that one of the top ten psychotherapists, how much you think they're paying him, I should be in that group, ah? What the hell that all about, okay? So, I needed a framework to organize the information. I mean one of the things we know about experts in every domain is that they have a lot of domain-specific knowledge and moreover that knowledge is organized in a readily accessible fashion. So, I needed a framework. So, what I'm going to do is walk you through the generic example of this framework and then talk about the implications that it has. I'm going to do more than that. I'm going to reduce your entire professional career to one page. This is it. Okay, people ask you what do I do? You go, look at these nine boxes, that's me, okay? And I don't get paid enough, okay? So, what I'm going to do with Matt's help, as walk you through this framework and then what I'm going to do is highlight for you what I think are the core task of psychotherapy. What is it that expert therapists do that leads to better results? I just said through a presentation by Scott Miller. And in fact, if you have the desire for an entertaining session, Scott Miller and I are going to present tomorrow morning eight to nine, okay? This is like The Bickersons. This is a cohort question, okay? Okay. So, if you've Don Ameche and Frances Langford, okay? It's like the whole old Bob and Ray show. So, we're going to be there. We did this at the Evolution's Conference. I'm going to talk about expertise in the area of therapy. So, let me walk you through your career, okay? And this is all online. So, you could download it afterwards. So, if you are a clinician, one of the things that happens as you most likely have some kind of intake form that you use that ascertains for the client, a whole bunch of demographic and other kind of background information. So, you get the age, the gender, the sexual orientation, you get the cultural identity, this is really important because when you see, this is essentially in Risk and Protective Factors model and that these vary by cultural and racial groups developmentally. You're going to get living conditions education, all of you have some kind of form that gets out what I characterize as 1.A. And moreover, one of the things you want to ascertain is 1.B. that is what is the reason they are here, how did they get here now? I mean, did they come of their own volition, do they see that there is a problem? If they don't see that there is problem, why should they work with you, okay? Are they there, because they are mandated, okay? The court say, you want to keep the kit, you want your driver's license back, you don't want to get out to the military, you got to -- that -- why you are here? My mother brought me, okay? What let her to bring you? My father is neanderthal, okay? So, what happens is it becomes interesting and clearly has important implications for you as a therapist in terms of how do you motivate people, your responsibility to see -- not only that you go down the box two. Okay. What box two is what is their presenting problem? What's getting them into the therapeutic process? They are depressed, they are suicidal, they have eating disorders, they have the aftermath of trauma exposure and there is a number of questions that you could ask that will open that up. Now, as you look at this set of boxes, this flow chart, think of them as a window on to your computer and that you would be able to open up any of these and see the kinds of questions, assessment tools and the like. If you want to see what this looks like for juvenile offenders, if you go in and take a look at the anger handbook, okay? We have this written out for 12,000 adolescent offenders who come into Juvenile Assessment Center in Miami-Dade. So not only do I need 2.A., I also need 2.B. What is 2.B.? It's the level of functioning. This becomes interesting, because it's essentially quality of life indicators. And what we know from the VA studies in others is that various kinds of interventions are effective in reducing 2.A., which is the symptomatology, especially positive symptoms, but often people's quality of life doesn't improve. Not only that we can now go down to box three, in 80% of the cases that we see clients have comorbid disorders. So not only can you ask what did they cubbing with and what impact does it have, but what problems do they have in addition to these that need to be addressed therapeutically and what's the impact of that? So, you get a lot of comorbidity with returning soldiers with regard to PTSD and substance abuse or anger problems or guilt kinds of problems or suicidality and this is going to rise some really interesting questions for you, the expert therapists, because they could question is whether you're going to do treatment sequentially, okay? Well, get it, get a handle on the drinking and then we'll put you in the trauma-focused group, okay? Or are you going to do these in a parallel fashion. Okay. I can solve there are a lot of residential programs and this is a kind of interesting exercise. So one of the things that you find is that if you're paying 25 to $40,000 a month to attend these residential programs. They give you a chart of how your days going to be spent. So you wake up in the morning, okay, and will just ease in, you know the meditation that we worked on, then you'll do, you're cleaning up, well, have breakfast and then get the meds. This morning, we're going to go for the 12-step program on the substance abuse when you'll be able to relinquish to a higher power. This afternoon, what we're going to do -- you're ready for this? Because we have the Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy, so you can take charge of your PTSD, and the client looks at you and he goes, I'm screwing up! I go to the AA and I think I'm taking charge of God. In the afternoon, I relinquished the PTSD. Not like that, your parents are coming on the weekend, so the assert of this training will take place, okay? We're not gonna get into relapse prevention until the very end, because we need to have you come back. We need heads on beds, okay, I'm not far off. So the interesting question is, how do we treat people in an integrated fashion. And there are now a number of programs by the Javis, Clecther, Russo, Ford and others, that I review in the workshops that look at how do you treat, what is PTSD in substance abuse go-ahead in hand? And why is it higher in women than it is in men? Okay. So it's become really interesting. This is gonna guide your decision-making. Not only that, we need to ascertain, what stresses are you exposed to? On a daily basis, there are four kinds of stresses that your clients are exposed to. Those are daily hassles, legal, physical, familial kinds of issues that may go on. They may be ecological, they may be living in a high-risk environment. I work with native populations, in fact I did a whole project with the Inuit, which was really interesting, because they are used to be rather, nomadic and then they caribou came ill and they ended up being uh, uh, circumscribe to a given area, the Canadian government, they are calling it reservation, but it changed their lives. To complicate things, also the Canadian government brought in educators for the kids, well intention. Turned out, one of the educators they brought in was a pedophile, who sexually abused 86 boys over the course of three years. That cohort of 86 is one of the highest suicide rates in North America, of 200 per 100,000. And I was the consultant with the native healers on how to provide treatment. Very interesting kind of issue, what is cognitive behavior or evidence-based treatments, I have to say, when you're dealing with native populations. So one of the things that becomes very interesting is what are the nature of the ecological stressors that people are exposed to. Moreover, you could also ascertain what are developmental stresses in terms of foresee, in terms of history of victimization. And it's just not just victimization, the A studies indicate that you need to have cumulative impact of multiple stressors, and moreover, is this familiarly communicated. So when we talked all about childhood depression and so forth, you can see the transmission of this due to a variety of factors. What am I doing and why? I'm inviting you to accompany to the case presentation before we were walking into the office to see the client into the group therapy room. You are being inundated with information and I needed some organizational framework, right. I needed to get some sense of what got you here? What bothers you? How long has this been going on? What is the impact on you on a daily basis? In addition, what are the kinds of problems did you have? And if you have those problems, what is the impact of that? And moreover, what kinds of stresses do you have on a daily basis. Where are you living, what's the impact of that? Moreover, how long has this been going on? Are there kind of prior exposure to victimization and moreover what about the family? Are you going home to a high expressed emotional environment that may sabotaging on the mindness and moreover, if we look at the next one, you can start to say what kinds of treatments have you received for this thus far, okay, and are these treatments in fact effective as evident by. And moreover, did you have difficulty following through with these treatment non-adherence in name of the game and we also know that patient satisfaction is important. So what worked in the past may be something that we might. So when we have borderlines come in, we actually have the staff come around with borderline patients and we tap their expertise what are borderlines expert at, mental health system, they've been to more EL on rooms then you will ever visit in your professional career. So we asked could you share with us, where you have been, what seems to work, what doesn't, what are the lessons that we could benefit from. Not only that let me ask you one last question, can you foresee or envision how will our staying here with you be different. So one of the things we know is that patient satisfaction is important predictor. Now I would suggest that in your clinical practice you do boxes one to five, but I'm going to advocate a Strengths-based Approach, because you need to get what Paul Harvey, the radio commentator called the Rest of the Story. And the Rest of the Story is what are the signs of resilience and strengths that individuals evidence in spite of. So if you look at the videos that they have for sale that I put out here or the recent video that I put out for American Psychological Association, there was a client who had multiple victimization experiences and she attempted suicide seven times. So no one leaves my office until I get box six, a box six are either individual, social, or systemic strengths that we could call upon. I need to find nuggets, I mean what makes cognitive behavior therapy effective. I have been doing this for 35 years and my tongue and cheek answers, only partly tongue and cheek is that I think cognitive behavior therapy works because it helps to prevent depression in psychotherapist. So if you are getting depressed on your job, it is because you have embraced the wrong theoretical perspective, okay. You're solution focused, you are family systemic, you are psychodynamic, you are behavioral, okay? Because from a cognitive behavioral point of view, you need to get the rest of the story. I think part of what makes therapy works is the quality of nature and therapeutic alliance. And if you have me as a therapist, I'm never gonna give up, okay, that there is a person behind DSM diagnoses and it's my job to tap the rest of the story. So what did you do for survival. So I just wrote a chapter on how to nurture resilience in returning soldiers. We have a website called war fighters diary that you can go to, this is very interesting, it's a warfightersdiary.com. And if you go to that, you will go across the top and hit videos and on it you will hear 21 stories of soldiers telling their accounts of resilience. Now to give you an idea of what this looks like for the future, you can download all of those 21 videos onto your iPod and play them when you need 'em. So we have now been able to develop, okay, tools whereby soldiers would be able in the area of physical interpersonal, emotional, cognitive, behavioral and spiritual go on and hear how other soldiers handle those particular stresses. So if you go on, you'll hear about some women, whose best buddy actually committed suicide and she can't believe that this guy who looked invincible and how is she gonna handle it and then she demonstrates coping responses. Okay. Not only that, this is going viral, so if you the soldier have a better way of handling it, you'll be able to submit it to the website in terms of a YouTube kind of format. Okay. And then like amazon.com, you'll be notified the rest of your life, okay, you know that you could hear other people. So my notion is how can we tap box six and moreover you the therapist can say this isn't only something in my head, okay, but if you click to the next page there, Matt? You will see that I have a running script that goes along with this. So it says, Hi, Don, let me see what brings you here at this point in time. Look at that he's going for box 2.A., well done Don. And then did you come off your own volition, oh, look at that he's doing 1.B. And the impact of this on a day-to-day basis seems to be, oh, look at that he's now doing 2.B. And in addition and every time you hear me say, in addition, you now know I'm working box three. And in addition you're also struggling with and the impact of that is -- and it seems to be made worse by -- oh, look at that he now has moved down to box four, nicely done Don. So the day-to-day stresses are, okay, and you're living where and the impact of that is and it's not only now you've had this kind of experience before and you're living with whom, and for this you receive what kinds of -- oh, look at that he just moved down to box five, nicely done Don. Okay. And it seemed to work as evident by, but you had difficulty following through. But you are particularly satisfying and think that we could build on, is that what you are saying? And in spite of and every time you hear me say, in spite of, you now know that I'm working in box six. So in spite of and not only do you get that, you have to then follow it by the questions how and what. Why questions are not very productive. So you've got -- so how do you, are you telling, are you saying to me that in spite of -- now you will note that every one of these questions are how and what questions. In fact one of the things I think as your most valuable tool as an expert therapist has to do with the degree to which you have the art of questioning in your repertoire. And the person I would suggest you emulate is this DTV personage of Peter IV playing the character, Columbo okay. One of the things I try to do in my workshop is to train clinicians on how to play dumb. For some, this is not a difficult, nor a challenging role, it comes remarkably easy, the key question is how do you play dumb without giving up your placebo value. Okay, I mean, why should I come to your level, pay for this. So this is actually a way that you could talk to clients as well as your colleague. Let's go back one, if you would? There are -- keep going back to the boxes if you would. Okay, so let’s just finish this up. So one of the things you could do is give a summary to the client, it sounds to me and correct me if I'm wrong, see if I picked up one, these are well global like statements. See if I'm in tune with and then you could summarize boxes one to five. And then on the other hand in spite of you have done, okay, of these areas where do you think we therapeutic lions should begin the process? So instead of you being a surrogate frontal lobe for your clients, a surrogate frontal lobe where you -- you are now going to negotiate with clients so that the treatments make sense. So those people coming into residential programs who go through this process, all of these pieces make sense where the AA fits in, where the trauma focus fits in, where the assertiveness? So instead of being a hodgepodge of two three hundred techniques, you now have a framework that you could share with the clients and others. Not only that, your job is not done because you can now articulate with the client using Kiresuk's Goal Attainment Scaling where we should begin the process. So I say to clients, let me explain what I do for a living. It really isn’t that complicated. Say, I work with folks like yourself and I try to find out how things are now in your life. And then what I’d like to do is to help you, help me understand how you would like them to be. I would like our current efforts to be informed by what you’ve tried in the past. So what’s worked and what hasn’t? Did you have difficultly following through with that? What we particularly satisfied with that we think we could build on? If we work together and I hope we can, how would we know that we are making progress. What would we therapeutics see, what would other people notice? And let me ask one last question if I might. Can you foresee, can you envision anything that might get in the way? Oh, look at that, he just moved up to box nine, right? He is now looking at potential individual social and systemic barriers that might get in the way. And in fact, one of the things that’s emerging in the literature is that you need to include barriers assessment. So one of the key things in the area, you’ve got 350,000 soldiers coming back who have clinical needs. Okay. Less than 45% ever go for treatment. So there are enumerable barriers that get in the way of them seeking help. If you don’t address that issue of barriers, you never even gonna get them to be able to employ some of the evidence based interventions. I’m going to challenge you. I am going to suggest that there is absolutely nothing that you do for living that I can’t quote in these nine boxes, that this is your entire professional career. Okay. Now, play this game. The next time you go back to your clinic and there is a case conference, and they say to you, you know, your timing is immaculate. You seem to go these conferences when we get in the most difficult challenging patient. Well, we have saved a dude for you, okay? You deserve this, okay? Okay. You will not believe this woman. She was out to lunch. Okay. Not only that, I’m not even sure, she is going to show up. And when you meet her husband, okay, it is off the work. Now this is not the only problem that you have. And you say, excuse me, I’m a little bit overwhelmed. You seem to be jumping from box to box. You see, you said she was a beaut, okay? So you are now telling me about 2.A. And then you say, she may not even show up. So you immediately going for 5.C. So you jump from 2 and then you say when do you meet the husband, so you are going for 9.B. So you go from 2.A. down to 5.C. to 9. And then you say in addition, she’s -- so then you -- I’m a little bit overwhelmed, oh, would you stay in one box for a moment. Okay. So not only can you share this with the client, a big problem that we have is that people coming into psychiatric facility, are only there for 6 to 14 days. So we have to refer them to clinicians who are leaving. The major issue is relapse. So if we could train clinicians out there who we’re refereeing to on the boxes, we could tell them what we have and what we don’t have and what's kinds of risk factors? Now, we have changed these boxes. In fact, I have the outage, how boxes will consult. This is another an age thing, you know, by how gun will travel -- anyway alright. So the older you get in Florida, the more these memories take on importance. So one of the things that becomes interesting is we could tell the clinicians out there what it is that we are working on in one information and where they might go. So continuity of care is one of the most important predictive factors in terms of these kinds of efforts. Not only that if you go to the yellow handbook, there is a computer generated report that is all written out. And all you have to do is fill in the missing information of 2.A., 3.A., 5.B. and so forth. One of the things that characterize expert therapist is that they take good progress notes. So imagine that you ask me to pick up a client of yours and you are no longer around. And all I have is your progress notes. Do you think I would be able to go into your progress notes and ascertain where you’ve been with the client and where you intend to go? And do you think if I asked your client, I would get a similar account? Now, let’s say that you came to out workshop and we did these cases and so forth. I opened up your folder and it says, I’m a 2.A. guy, I do 2.A. I have a variety of interventions to try and reduce the nature of symptomatology at that level. Not only that I do 2.A., 5.C., 5.V., in terms of treatment non-adherence. Okay. And once I get stabilization on that, I cannot do this alone, I need to go for 6.B. That is you would be able to write down and quote every one of those events. Now we have altered these boxes for traumatic brain injury, for military vets. So if you go on and see the references, you’d be able to go to those resources. So now, you’re my referral therapist, right? And I need to go to someone who I consider an expert. So what does the literature tell us about what makes someone an expert therapist? What is the one skill that you need based on the research that will lead to a rich and rewarding life that will lead to positive outcomes? What is the most important skill you need? It turns out that the most important skill you need as a commission if you want a rich and rewarding life with good outcome is the ability to choose your patients carefully. If you can choose who you see, it will go a long way in predicting outcome, okay. So what you need is to select what are called YAVISs. Young, Attractive, Verbal, Intelligent and Successful people like yourself. So you essentially need to treat yourself, okay. Oh, my good, okay. Now, for many of us, we do not have the license or ability or even the liberty to choose who we see. Okay. And most of our clinical are filling up those boxes in terms of co-morbidity. So what else do we know is the most important ingredient in terms of therapeutic outcome. And it turns out as you could well expect that it’s therapeutic alliance. The quality and nature of the therapeutic alliance predicts outcome more than whatever specific procedure you use. And it turns out, it’s not only defined in psycho therapy, it’s defined in every area. So doctors and surgeons who are well like at better results than others. I wrote a whole book on treatment non-adherence, so I get invited to medical schools to talk about treatment non-adherence. And one of the things, I love to point out to new medical students is that incompetent doctors who are well-liked, get sued less. This has a lot of appeal to new medical students, okay. So the prick took off the wrong leg. Okay. I mean, it’s a human error. I mean, what you're gonna do, sue the guy? I mean, the leg was shorter to begin with, okay? It’s only going to make the lawyers rich, okay? So one of the things that becomes interesting is the quality and nature of the relationship is important. Now there are three ways to assess that. One is you could ask the patient, the other is you could ask the therapist, who, I am good. You have no idea. I mean, even when patients don’t show up, I do therapy on myself. I actually should charge more. Okay. Or, you could do observations of the interactions and see how it predicts outcome. Well it turns out, of this three, the best predictor is patient feedback. Okay. And we just learn from Miller and so forth it’s the amount of improvement in the quality and nature of that. Once again, we will have a debate on this tomorrow morning if you are game to be up that early. So one of the things that becomes very interesting in this particular arena is that the major core tasks has to do with the therapeutic alliance. Is there a way that you can go back to the actual handout prior to this? Is that on there? So they can see what’s on the -- yeah. So what -- I’m gonna just go right back to the beginning of it. So what I’m doing is, I’m actually walking you through the handout that’s on the therapy process. Just go the next page. The second item that's really critical in this particular domain is cultural sensitivity. The Melissa Institute did a whole conference on cultural sensitivity. And since we are in Miami, I have a very large handout on how to do psycho therapy with Hispanic population. Okay. And you need to recognize how this varies, you know, whether you are dealing with African Americans or Cuban Americans or Asian Americans, or native populations and there are major implications for effectiveness. And I cannot highlight enough the role our cultural factors play. So if you look at my boxes, for those of you who are statistically minded, what I just laid out for you is a complicated multiple regression equation that's designed to predict differential outcomes when each of those boxes are what I call beta weights in predicting the likelihood of success. 

00:40:40
iv. Monitor the patient's progress and use the information to guide ongoing 

00:40:40
treatment. 

00:40:40
2. Be culturally-sensitive when conducting assessments and the therapist should develop 

00:40:40
treatment knowledge and competence in treating ethnically diverse populations. 

00:40:40
i. As Bowman (2007) highlights. 

00:40:40
"Become more aware of your existing assumptions, and accept that 

00:40:40
some of these assumptions may not apply to ethnic minority groups"(p. 

00:40:40
113) 

00:40:40
ii. Conduct an ethnocultural assessment that taps the patient's level of 

00:40:40
acculturation, circumstances and impact of migration on family and on self. 

00:40:40
iii. Assess for culturally specific symptomatology and provide culturally-bases 

00:40:40
interventions. 

00:40:40
iv. Treatment should be sensitive to the patient's expectations, cultural 

00:40:40
interpersonal style, values and metaphors/language. Interian and Diaz- 

00:40:40
Martinez (2007) provide a good example of such cultural adaptation with 

00:40:40
Hispanic patients as they alter psychotherapy to include such Hispanic 

00:40:40
concepts such as Simpatico, Respecto, Formalismo (setting examples), 

00:40:40
Personalismo, Fatalismo, Marianismo (self-sacrifice). Poner de mi parte 

00:40:40
(doing one's part), Dichos (saying and proverbs) and religious values. (See 

00:40:40
Handout on Cultural Issues). When conduction these culturally-based 

00:40:40
Interventions, it is important not to impose cultural stereotypes and recognize 

00:40:40
marked differences within cultural groups. 

00:40:40
Tailor interventions to ethnic groups. For example, see Hinton et al..(2006) 

00:40:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  Give you a quick example of this, in our area of head injury, okay, when we look at the place that I can say, where we train people, you could ask people what it was their head like at the time on the motor vehicle accident, the violence episode, what have you. In terms of Glasgow Coma Scores, in terms of intracranial pressures, in terms of post dramatic amnesia, and so forth. I could even ask what are the psychological sequelae. I could ask you for instance in terms of what was your head like before here. I could walk you through all those boxes. If you have a head injury and I want to predict how well you would do three to five years down the road, it turns out that one of the most important beta weights is Box 9. If you have a head injury and a lawyer, your prognosis is poor. Okay. If there are compensation issues that may undermine your engagement in the therapy process, it will interfere with it. And the same thing happens if you work in VA hospitals where if you give up PTSD, you lose compensation. So one of the things that becomes interesting is that these are not just idle issues but need to be addressed therapeutically. So I’ve now gotten you through hopefully a way for you to think about the case conceptualization. I’m now in the business of having you look at one of the core tasks. So you got to be able to develop, monitor and address any ruptures and alliance as they occur. Okay. You need to do it in a culturally sensitive way if we go back to the slide. 

00:42:15
1. Develop a collaborative therapeutic relationships/alliance and help the patient "tell" 

00:42:15
his/her story. After listening attentively and compassionately to the patient's distress and 

00:42:15
"emotional pain". help the patient identify "strengths" and signs of resilience. "What did 

00:42:15
he/she accomplish in spite of...?" "How was this achieved?" Obtain the "rest of the 

00:42:15
story". Use Sarcastic Questioning... 

00:42:15
i. Foster bonding between patient and therapist. Address any ruptures or 

00:42:15
strains in the alliance and address any therapy-interfering behaviors. 

00:42:15
ii. Collaborate with the patient in establishing treatment goals and the means 

00:42:15
to achieve these goals. 

00:42:15
iii. Encourage the patient's motivation to change and promote the patient's 

00:42:15
belief that therapy can help. (Use Motivational Interviewing Procedures). 

00:42:15
iv. Monitor the patient's progress and use the information to guide ongoing treatment. 

00:42:15
2. Be culturally-sensitive when conducting assessments and the therapist should develop 

00:42:15
treatment knowledge and competence in treating ethnically diverse populations. 

00:42:15
i. As Bowman (2007) highlights. 

00:42:15
"Become more aware of your existing assumptions, and accept that 

00:42:15
some of these assumptions may not apply to ethnic minority groups"(p. 

00:42:15
113) 

00:42:15
ii. Conduct an ethnocultural assessment that taps the patient's level of 

00:42:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM The next kind of core task that therapists need to engage in is what is called, just go down to number 3, is psycho education. 

00:42:25
3. On an ongoing basis educate the patient about his/her problems and possible solutions 

00:42:25
and facilitate awareness. use various ways to educate and nurture a sense of curiosity 

00:42:25
and discovery. 

00:42:25
i. Conduct Risk and Protective Factors assessment and provide constructive 

00:42:25
feedback. Probe about the patient's views of presenting problems and 

00:42:25
his/her theories of behavioral change. 

00:42:25
use a Case Conceptualization Model and share therapy rationale. 

00:42:25
Have the patient engage in self-monitoring and conduct situational and 

00:42:25
developmental analyses. 

00:42:25
Use videotape modeling films and other educational materials (simple handouts with Acronyms) 

00:42:25
v. Use a "Clock metaphor" - "Vicious Cycle" Model 

00:42:25
12 o'clock - external and internal triggers 

00:42:25
3 o'clock - primary and secondary emotions. 

00:42:25
6 o'clock - automatic thoughts, thinking patterns and 

00:42:25
Schemas or beliefs. Note common core recurrent 

00:42:25
patterns 

00:42:25
9 o'clock - behaviors and resultant consequences 

00:42:25
The therapist can use his/her hand to convey the Clock Metaphor by 

00:42:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. And when I say psycho education, I’m not talking about a mini lecture like this. So walking people through the boxes, getting people to self monitor, one of the techniques that we use a lot with clients is what I call a clock metaphor. This is kind of interesting. You are essentially in the business of listening to people’s stories. I mean, psycho therapy isn’t some sexy thing. People come in and tell you stories, you can’t believe that there is not jobs out there. And, I mean, how long this is would be going -- no one gets a god damn shit that I served in Iraq. Okay. No one gets a god damn, I’m on the outskirt, I’m a burden on this, okay? You get -- you get paid to listen to stories. And that’s what this conference is all about. So what my framework is, is you are in the business of trying to change people stories and their coping techniques. So one of the things is that whenever anyone tells you a story, you can break it up into its components. So I say to the client, it sounds to me and correct me if I’m wrong, and I put my hand at 12’o clock. And 12’o clock are the triggers, these are internal and external triggers that an individual may have experienced. That trigger may be what someone said or did or what they failed to say or do. What may be an internal trigger, may be a flash back, it may be an urge, it may be something else. And I say, let me see if I understand and I put my hand and get their elaboration. Then I slowly move my hand around to 3’o clock. And what’s at 3’o clock? It's the nature of the primary and secondary feelings that they had given that kind of event. So I felt anxious, I felt afraid. I felt angry. Okay? And in fact, you may have anger as a result of being abandoned, feeling abandoned. You may be anxious about being depressed. So these may work in a very complicated fashion. I can then move my hand down to 6’o clock. And what is 6’o clock, it's the nature of the automatic thoughts and thinking processes and schemers that being touched. And then I slowly put my hand at 9’o clock. 9’o clock is what did you do? I stuffed the feelings, I went for a drink. I hit the bitch. Okay. I withdrew. And when you did that, how did all the people respond? So let me walk you through this one more time. 12’o clock, external and internal triggers. 3’o clock, primary and secondary emotions. 6’o clock, cognitive processes, automatic thoughts, developmental schemers. 9’o clock, behaviors and resulting consequences. And then I would invite you to do the following with your clients. Say to them it sounds to me and correct me if I’m wrong that it’s just a vicious and on the word vicious, put your hand at 9’o clock and move it around this imaginary clock without finishing the sentence. Just go it’s a vicious, and don’t just go vicious, whoop -- okay, it’s a vicious and I assure you that if you try this with your clients, there is a very high probability that they will finish the sentence and say cycle or circle. Now if you do this, and they get to 6’o clock and they have not said it, you do not sit there and go sounds like, okay. Small word, okay. Two syllables, okay. Work with me on this fellow, we can do this, it’s a vicious, come on. I say it’s at tip of the tongue. So they are going to say, cycle or circle. And you go, vicious cycle. In what way, is this a vicious cycle? Are you telling me, are you saying to yourself that when this occurs, you feel what and then what do you do with those feelings. And when you do that with the feelings, you have to throw it off and that makes you even more vigilant about. And then you withdraw and when you -- look, don’t change anything. We're only at the point of understanding. Let’s see if this vicious cycle, as you describe it, actually occurs. So what we're going to do is have a whole set of procedures about how to get people to monitor whether they actually do this. And they are going to come in and say I do it. And then you and your best Columbo say, you do what. And they’re going to say, I do the vicious cycle. Well, if you do the vicious cycle as you describe it, what is the impact? What is the toll? What is the price you and others pay? I ask that question all the time. Impact total price you pay to which the client’s going to say I don’t know. To which you should say, I don’t know either. Remember, you don’t have to be a surrogate frontal lobe. I just went to a workshop, let me explain. Okay? See I am at my therapeutic best when the clients I see are one step ahead of me offering advice or suggestions I would otherwise offer. The whole name of the game is for clients to convince me that what they need is cognitive behavior therapy, for which I go I’m not too sure. You wiped out how many other therapists in town? So they are going to say, I do it. And what is the impact, and what is the toll? Now the beauty of auto questioning is that when you ask a question, there is a supposition that there is an answer, you know, there’s an impact total price you pay. And if we can discover it, we will create it. And if it has that kind of impact and toll, what could we therapeutic alliance do. Your client does not have to be a rocket scientist to say, well, maybe one of the things I should do is break the cycle. To which, you go, break the cycle. That’s kind of interesting. How are you presently going about breaking the cycle? So now, all of a sudden, all of their psychopathology is their attempt to break the cycle. So if they are using addictive then, they are self medicating to deal with the intrusive ideation. If they are withdrawing -- so all of the kind -- so what is therapy about? Fortunately, we are going to try and work on better ways to break the cycle. Other core tasks. Let me just tick these off since I’m running out of time. We’ll have more of this tomorrow when I do the clinical demo. Okay. So everything that I’ve just commented to is on here with the scripts, and you can download that. The next kind of thing that becomes really critical as an expert therapist is you have a product to sell. 

00:49:05
4. Help the patient reconceptualize his/her "problems" in a more hopeful fashion. 

00:49:05
i. Do a life-review (User Time-lines) Identify "strengths" 

00:49:05
Timeline 1 – Birth to present. Note stressors and various treatments. 

00:49:05
Timeline 2 – Birth to present. Note “strengths” and “In spite of” 

00:49:05
and use “How” and “What” questions. Note 

00:49:05
evidence of any strengths that may extend back in time to 

00:49:05
prior generations and what they did to “survive” and cope 

00:49:05
with stressors. Note signs of “cultural resilience”. 

00:49:05
Timeline 3 – Present into future 

00:49:05
Highlight: How things are now and how would the patient 

00:49:05
like them to be in the future? 

00:49:05
The therapist can go on to ask: 

00:49:05
“What can we do to help you achieve your goals 

00:49:05
of …? 

00:49:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And the product you have to sell is hope. Okay. If tomorrow and all the future tomorrows where just like yesterday, what’s the point. And you can look at a whole variety of ways about how we nurture hope. And one of the ways, I prefer the work of C.R. Snyder and their colleagues and others is that you can nurture hope by engaging people in collaborative goal setting. People having short-term, intermediate and long-term goals that are smart, that are specific, measureable, achievable, realistic and time oriented are often useful, and not only that, you could use what we call as a number of time lines, because I could find out for you -- from you what you’ve done to survive. So we have a time line one of what you’ve experienced, what kind of treatments you’ve had. We have time line two, which is Box 6. It is the in spite of box. And then we have Box, line 3, which is how are things now and how would you like it to be. 

00:50:00
Timeline 2 – Birth to present. Note “strengths” and “In spite of” 

00:50:00
and use “How” and “What” questions. Note 

00:50:00
evidence of any strengths that may extend back in time to 

00:50:00
prior generations and what they did to “survive” and cope 

00:50:00
with stressors. Note 

00:50:00
signs of “cultural resilience”. 

00:50:00
Timeline 3 – Present into future 

00:50:00
Highlight: How things are now and how would the patient 

00:50:00
like them to be in the future? 

00:50:00
The therapist can go on to ask: 

00:50:00
“What can we do to help you achieve your goals 

00:50:00
of …? 

00:50:00
What have you tried in the past to achieve your goals 

00:50:00
of…? What has worked? What has not worked, as evident 

00:50:00
by…?” 

00:50:00
“If we worked together, and I hope we will, how would we 

00:50:00
know if you were making progress? What changes would 

00:50:00
someone else notice in your behaviors?” 

00:50:00
“Let me ask one more question, if I might. Can you foresee 

00:50:00
or envision anything that might get in the way or act as a 

00:50:00
barrier or obstacle to your achieving…? What do you 

00:50:00
think could be done to anticipate and address such 

00:50:00
potential barriers?” 

00:50:00
ii. Use collaborative goal-setting (short-term, intermediate, long-term goals) 

00:50:00
iii. Use videotape coping modeling films 

00:50:00
iv. Use letter-writing, journaling 

00:50:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM One of the things I’ve learned from native populations, which was really interesting was the time line two should be extended back in time in terms of what you’ve got from previous cultures, previous generations so that there is inter-generational resilience that you could call upon. So if you look at what happened during Katrina okay? And what happened to African American population there, it’s a history of the way African-Americans have been treated historically, okay? So the interesting question is how did they get through that. What is the lessons that we can learn. So the interesting issue is that the concept of resilience not only individual, it’s a family, it’s a culture as a racial group. And that helps to change the nature of the narrative. One of the major problems that we have is that therapist are in the business of teaching skills. So you go to these workshops okay, on diet, on borderline personal, everybody’s got packages and skills to train, intra and interpersonal skills. The major issue is that nothing, nothing generalizes. You cannot just train and hope. So there is as an expert therapist, a whole literature instead of guidelines that you’ll see in the book on how the build-in generalization principles. So you just can’t train and hope. [indiscernible]There are things you got to do before, during and after a task, in order to increase the likelihood that they are going to do it. So I can sell for a lot of residential programs that where people spend really big bucks. And the bottom line is that there is not continuity of care. If there is not continuity of care. If there is not follow through, if there is not patient check list. If those elements are not built-in, all the money is wasted. So you are an expert therapist, you got to say, you have no idea how good I am. Okay. Okay. More over, if we continue on in terms of these skills, some of the skills will work and some won't. 

00:51:50
Use group processes – open-ended groups 

00:51:50
vi. Use Alumni clubs of successful patients (coping models) 

00:51:50
vii. Use hope-engendering mentors 

00:51:50
5. Ensure that the patient has intra- and interpersonal coping skills 

00:51:50
i. Highlight the discrepancy between valued goals and current behavior and 

00:51:50
consequences and consider what can be done to close this gap. 

00:51:50
ii. Train and nurture specific skills to the point of mastery. 

00:51:50
iii. Build in generalization – do not merely “train and hope” for transfer 

00:51:50
(Follow the specific steps of what you need to do to before, during and 

00:51:50
after training in order to increase the likelihood to achieve generalization 

00:51:50
and ensure maintenance. (See Meichenbaum’s Handbook on Anger 

00:51:50
Control, pp. 334-341.) 

00:51:50
iv. Put the patient in a consultative mode. (The patient needs to explain, 

00:51:50
and/or demonstrate or teach skills learned). 

00:51:50
6. Encourage the patient to perform "personal experiments" 

00:51:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM When they work, you got to make sure that people take credit for the change. All the data indicates that self attribution enhances the likelihood of maintenance and generalization. So Don, let me see, how did you handle this time compared to how you handle it in the past. Where else have you done this? I mean, how long is this been going on. Are you telling me, are you saying to yourself that you could actually notice that you actually quote yourself that you can see ahead of time that this was a high-risk situation. The name of the game for therapy is to have your patient take your voice with them. So you have very interesting way to ascertain whether your clients are taking your voice with them. One way is to account the number of times clients in an unprompted fashion use these verbs, spontaneously on their own. So every time they use one these words, your big toe should go up and done once. It’s a very interesting measure, I don’t know if you notice this. I can see how I drive my fell crazy. I can see that was a high-risk situation beforehand, okay? So one of the things that becomes very interesting is you got to make sure if you are an expert therapist that people nail it. But they take credit that they see some connection between their efforts and the outcome. The next kind of issue is that in many of these kinds of situations, we're dealing with patterns of behavior that occur repetitively. 

00:53:10
Control, pp. 334-341.) 

00:53:10
iv. Put the patient in a consultative mode. (The patient needs to explain, 

00:53:10
and/or demonstrate or teach skills learned). 

00:53:10
6. Encourage the patient to perform "personal experiments" 

00:53:10
i. Solicit change talk, commitment statements, self-explanations and self-generated 

00:53:10
reasons for behavioral change. 

00:53:10
ii. Facilitate “corrective emotional experiences” (ala Alexander & French, 1946). 

00:53:10
iii. Involve significant others. 

00:53:10
iv. Ensure that the patient takes the "data" from his/her personal experiments as 

00:53:10
"evidence" to unfreeze his/her beliefs about self, the future and the world. 

00:53:10
7. Ensure that the patient takes credit for change 

00:53:10
i. Use attribution training -- use metacognitive statements ("notice," "catch," 

00:53:10
"interrupt," "game plan") 

00:53:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Almost all adult forms of psychopathology begin during childhood and adolescence. 

00:53:15
7. Ensure that the patient takes credit for change 

00:53:15
i. Use attribution training -- use metacognitive statements ("notice," "catch," 

00:53:15
"interrupt," "game plan") 

00:53:15
ii. Nurture a sense of mastery and efficacy (“In spite of … How …?”) Use the language 

00:53:15
of “becoming” and of possibilities. 

00:53:15
iii. Monitor the degree to which the patient ascribes personal agency for change. Note 

00:53:15
the number of unprompted examples of where the patient takes the therapist’s voice 

00:53:15
with him/her, especially active transitive verbs. 

00:53:15
iv. Help the patient change his/her personal narrative or the “stories” he/she tells oneself 

00:53:15
and others. 

00:53:15
8. Conduct relapse prevention – follow treatment guidelines on how to conduct relapse 

00:53:15
prevention (See Meichenbaum’s Handbook on Anger Control , pp. 355-361). 

00:53:15
i. Be sensitive to the patient’s beliefs, behaviors and interpersonal conflicts that may 

00:53:15
block recovery. 

00:53:15
ii. Consider the episodic nature of the patient’s psychiatric disorders and any possible 

00:53:15
anniversary effects. 

00:53:15
iii. Identify high-risk situations and develop coping strategies. 

00:53:15
iv. Consider family and peers factors that can both undermine and support change. 

00:53:15
Consider the impact of a High Expressed Emotional Environment on the recovery 

00:53:15
process of the patient (criticism, intrusiveness). 

00:53:15
Additional Psychotherapeutic Tasks for Treating Psychiatric Patients With a History of 

00:53:15
Victimization. 

00:53:15
(Note that approximately 50% of psychiatric patients have a history of victimization.) 

00:53:15
9. Address basic needs and safety and help the patient develop the tools for symptom 

00:53:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So you got to have a life span perspective and you got to build in relapse prevention. That is where the action lies, especially in the area of substance abuse. Many treatments are effective in terms of getting people to stop, the key question is what happens when start again. Well, when they had enough depressed episode and there are numerable techniques where there is mindfully big, relapse prevention procedures or other kinds of techniques. So if you go to the handbooks, you’ll see that for everyone of these core skills, there is a breakout, a mini counseling. And in fact one of the things that I’m developing for the military that we hope will be put on the Melissa institute website is we have now identified the core task of psychotherapy. And that you the therapist will be able to go on click on that core task as you need it, motivational interview, suicide assessment, relapse prevention, exposure based intervention and you’ll get the rationale, the definition, the how-to features and a video clip of that task being used. So this is the whole idea of giving it away. So imagine that you're an ass and you got someone depressed and I immediately want to what should I -- what question should I ask for suit? How do I document it, okay? How do I nurture hope? How do I do relapse prevention? And the goal here is to identify the core task and then be able to have people access that. Here is the need thought. It goes viral. So let’s say that you are a therapist who has better way of doing that task, then what was on there. Ego. That is nothing okay? They have no idea that in my community with more population, so you will be able to submit your technique to the website and it will grow. And not only that, you will be notified like amazon.com that there are four more ways to do this task, would you like to see it? Not only that you are on it you're gonna go oh, shit that’s me. Do you want to email your friend about your mother? There are five additional core task. Because in about 50% to 60% of clients, they have a history of victimization. And I will just enumerate these task and we’ll cover them more tomorrow. The first thing is that there are traumatic based symptoms that need to be addressed in terms of panic attack, sleep disorders, dissociative behavior, you're the expert therapist need specific strategies to accomplish each one of those. Next on here is the need-to-do memory work. Now when I say memory work I’m not talking about going back and digging in and getting people to tell the story.

10. Address "memory work" and help with the patient’s belief system 

00:55:55
i. Consider various forms of "retelling" trauma story -- A “restorying” proces 

00:55:55
ii. Relive with cognitive restructuring: Contextualize memories --discriminate “then’ 

00:55:55
and “now”, putting memories in the past 

00:55:55
iii. Consider what implications (beliefs) the patient has drawn as a result of 

00:55:55
victimization experiences (“What lingers from …”; “What conclusions do you 

00:55:55
draw about yourself and others as a result of …”) 

00:55:55
iv. Consider impact of "shattered assumptions" and how to rescript narrative. Listen 

00:55:55
for and use the patient’s use of metaphors 

00:55:55
11. Help the patient find "meaning": Adopt a constructive narrative perspective 

00:55:55
i. Consider what the patient did to "survive" 

00:55:55
ii. What evidence of strengths in self and in others 

00:55:55
iii. What "lessons" learned that the patient can share with others – What can be 

00:55:55
salvaged from survivorship that the patient can make a “gift” to offer others? 

00:55:55
iv. What is the role of faith (spirituality) 

00:55:55
12. Help the patient re-engage and "reconnect" with others: Address the impact of trauma 

00:55:55
on family members, significant others and community. 

00:55:55
i. How to move beyond the "victim" role to that of becoming a “survivor”, 

00:55:55
even a “thriver” 

00:55:55
ii. How to engage in a proactive "helper" role 

00:55:55
iii. How to connect with adaptive/supportive peers and community resources 

00:55:55
13. A major way individuals often cope with the aftermath of exposure to traumatic events is 

00:55:55
to use some form of religion or spirituality. There is a need for therapists to explore with 

00:55:55
patients for whom such spiritually-oriented coping procedures are central, various ways 

00:55:55
to integrate them into the psychotherapy process. In doing so, therapists need to be

DONALD MEICHENBAUM  It’s not that bad things happen to people, bad things happen to lots of people. Considering the United States, there are 110 million women approximately. Epidemiological data indicates that 68 million women in the United States will be victimized. That’s remarkable okay. One in four will be sexually abused, 12% will be raped. Okay. Up to 20% will be raped second time. Domestic violence occurs once every 15 seconds. 38% of the women are going to be having repeated victimization. Here is the kicker. Of that 68 million, only 10% develop clinical problems. What the hell do the other 60 million doing? Don’t they read the literature? Don’t they watch Oprah? So the interesting question is what characterizes resilient individuals versus those who have chronic PTSD. And I don’t have time to take you through, but I have the algorithm of exactly what you need to do to develop chronic PTSD. So if something bad happens to you and you seem to be coping, I will give you the formula about how to screw up your life. Now, if there is any merit to that formula, then we can start to think about what are the implications for change. The other kinds of core task is not only what is the nature of the memory, but what is it that you conclude about yourself and others on the basis of that kind of process. How do you find meaning, there is real role for spirituality, spiritually based intervention. Keep in mind that with regard to trauma the major way that people cope with trauma in North America is by means of religion and prayer. So really interesting question is how do you incorporate spirituality. And in the workshops I give, I show a whole film on where was god on 9/11. And the interesting question is if these people came to you who have those kinds of beliefs, how would you use that therapeutically? How do you assess it? And then finally, how do you address the issue of re-victimization? So in the time allotted to me, what have I tried to do. The first thing I want to do is to encourage you to visit the Melissa Institute website and access the material that we have put in for that. The second thing is when you go to your handout, you will see my email address, which is dhmeich@aol.com. So if you have any feedback or other kinds of comments on this, I welcome you communication. Next I would like to challenge you to think about how do you conceptualize cases. How successful was I in reducing your entire professional career to that page? What else do you think you do that you don’t think I can quote? And more over, I would invite you to experiment and try that out. And finally, and I’ll talk more about this tomorrow morning, the field of psychotherapy is filled with hype. That’s a nice way of saying bullshit. No, seriously. And there are number of intervention that have the potential of making people worse that increase violence. So if anything, I think the key characteristic of an expert therapist is someone who is critically minded. Remember, I am trying to be an honest broker. And hopefully, my presentation this evening has facilitated your critical mindedness. I thank you for your attention and interest.
