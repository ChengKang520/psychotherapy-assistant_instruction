Laura 

00:00:00
LAURA  Hello, my name is Laura and I'm 25 years old and this is my story. I grew up in a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, in a middle class family where my father work and my mother stayed home to raise my sister and me. I always knew I was different from the other kids, but I can never pinpoint why. I was very outspoken, opinionated, intelligent and feminist all before I even got to high school. I had a few boyfriends during my junior and senior years, and through my first two years of college. I was always scrambling to get into another relationship immediately after I was finished with the previous one. During my junior year in college, I began having regular panic attacks that were keeping me from going to class, and at one time I seriously considered dropping out. I got into some recreational drug use as a mean to distract myself from facing my own inner struggle. That summer I met a girl at work, and one night after a party, one thing led to another and I finally understood what was so different about me after all. I got the courage to come out to myself as a lesbian. I then came out to my family who were supportive at me, and who basically knew all along anyway. I became very active in the Gay-Straight Alliance at my college, and began speaking out in classes and in the community about my story with the hopes of helping others understand the personal aspect of what is called the gay lifestyle. My lifestyle is this, I live with my partner, our two dogs and two cats. We plan to extend our family over the next few years by having a baby, probably by insemination and perhaps adopting as well. I'm doing this video to help educate future counselors about those ways in which it's crucial to understand the unique challenges that gay and lesbian clients face, as well as those ways that working with individuals in a sexual minority are just like working with any other non-gay clients. 

00:02:50
Joseph 

00:02:50
JOSEPH My name is Joseph. I'm a 26-year-old African-American college student and I'm gay. For me integrating my sexuality into my overall general well-being has been a very long process that has taken many years, and counseling has paid a large role(ph) in helping me to do so. Working on this video project has been important to me because I feel that the gay population is often an invisible group whose issues often go ignored many times, whether intentionally or unintentionally. I feel that it is important for counselors and therapists to have this information to better serve their clients. Because I had counselors that used similar techniques as demonstrated in this video. I have come to a point where I am able to enjoy and appreciate myself, and every aspect of myself including my sexuality. This is what I hope everyone can have in their life. 

00:03:40
Cindy 

00:03:40
CINDY Hi, I'm Cindy. I am a 47-year-old African-American lesbian. Like so many others I struggle with my sexual identity since my teenage years. I was brought up in a very strict Christian home with my stepfather being a minister. So, of course, I wasn't perceived as to quote, unquote, normal daughter. My parents prayed, told me I was going to hell, and placed me in therapy. My parents also proceed that if I wanted to change I could. So, I went into the military and started dating to force myself into changing. After years of trying to please everyone else, I gave up the dating scene and actively pursued a lesbian relationship. I rassled for many years with depression, low self-esteem, and my own lack of spiritual connection. I wanted a traditional lifestyle with children but without a husband. I've been a foster parent for about five years and have shared my home with at least seven children that needed a home. I began to attend the church administers to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. And attending church there and actively being a part, I was able to make a spiritual connection. The one thing that stood off for me in therapy was that my therapist never focused on me being a lesbian. They helped me focused on why I was uncomfortable with being a lesbian. I begin to realize that I was okay, and that I could have a very rewarding and fulfilling life. 

00:05:05
Vanessa 

00:05:05
VANESSA Hi. My name is Vanessa, and I'm 19 years old. I grew up on Milan, New York as an only child in an Italian-Irish family. My heritage and my being Roman Catholic made it difficult for me to come out to myself as a lesbian, little on anyone else. I feel gay-affirmative counseling is a truly important and I know it helped me to become comfortable with the person I am today.

GARRETT MCAULIFFE These are the unremarkable, yet very remarkable stories of people who happened to be gay. In this video, we will demonstrate gay-affirmative counseling. The notion is rooted in a fundamental belief that homosexuality is natural, that it stands alongside heterosexuality as an equal partner. It's a variation on a theme, not an aberration from a standard of heterosexuality. We ask you to consider embracing that attitude. We challenge you to move toward an appreciation of homosexuality as a vital and natural orientation for many, many people all over the world. Let's note- 

00:06:10
Resources Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel was developed and is endorsed by the following organizations: American Academy of Pediatrics American Counseling Association American Association of School Administrators American Federation of Teachers American Psychological Association American School Health Association Interfaith Alliance Foundation National Association of School Psychologists National Association of Social Workers National Education Association 

00:06:10
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - the stance of the American Psychological Association and I quote, for nearly- 

00:06:15
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association and defining the standard of the field, does not include homosexuality as a mental disorder. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-gender sexual desires among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among health and mental health professional organizations. 

00:06:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - three decades, it has been known that homosexuality is not a mental illness. Medical-

Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation & Youth A Primer for Principals, Educators & School Personnel (illegible text) 

00:06:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - and mental health professionals also now know that sexual orientation is not a choice, and cannot be altered. Perhaps this video will help in that regard.

Guidelines For Working With Gay & Lesbian Clients 

00:06:30
Angela Jones Psychologist Garrett McAuliffe Counselor Educator 

00:06:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  We'd like to share with you some guidelines that you might use when you do a gay-affirmative- 

00:06:45
OVERALL ISSUES IN GAY AFFIRMATIVE COUNSELING 

00:06:45
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - counseling with gay and lesbian clients. And I'm gonna start with one that I've asked you to think of inside yourself. Uhm, check yourself- 

00:06:55
Start With Yourself 

00:06:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - and become aware of any of your own hetero prejudice or views that perhaps uhm, block you from being affected with gay and lesbian clients. 

00:07:00
DR. ANGELA JONES And as Garrett and I have most definitely do is important- 

00:07:05
Office Decor & Symbols 

00:07:05
DR. ANGELA JONES - to make your office a diversity friendly environmental gay and lesbian clients. 

00:07:10
GARRETT MCAULIFFE In the same vein, use inclusive language. Terms like couple, partner are, ah, more generic terms than husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend. 

00:07:20
DR. ANGELA JONES And for heterosexual counselors it's important to be an ally- 

00:07:25
If You Are Not Gay: Be An Ally 

00:07:25
DR. ANGELA JONES - to the gay and lesbian community. 

00:07:25
GARRETT MCAULIFFE One element in which you can help establish trust with the client- 

00:07:30
Build Trust: Be Willing To Self-Disclose 

00:07:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - is just uhm, self-disclose, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE be able to be a person to the client, not a stiff kind of ah, remote figure. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. It is important that we as counselors don't assume- 

00:07:40
Remember Other Issues In A Gay Person's Life 

00:07:40
DR. ANGELA JONES - that sexual orientation is essential to, to the concerns of gay and lesbian clients. They come in with all different types of concerns. 

00:07:45
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Sure. And not(ph) just a part of people's lives, but it's an important point. A very important warning is- 

00:07:50
Professional organiza-tions representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals have all taken the position that homo-sexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is not need for a "cure." 

00:07:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE -to be really alert to dangers of this notion of- 

00:07:55
Conversion Therapy Can Be Harmful And Ineffective 

00:07:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE -conversion therapy. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Ah, there's really no evidence that conversion therapy works effectively and it- 

00:07:55
Reparative therapy -sometimes called "conversion thera-py" -is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. 

00:07:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - actually is unethical at this time... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
GARRETT MCAULIFFE ...to promote that with clients. 

00:08:00
DR. ANGELA JONES And just like with other minority group it's important not to expect- 

00:08:05
Be knowledgeable About Gay & Lesbian Issues 

00:08:05
DR. ANGELA JONES - the gay and lesbian... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE (clears throat) 

00:08:05
DR. ANGELA JONES ...community to teach you about gay and lesbian... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
DR. ANGELA JONES ...concerns or gay and lesbian lifestyles. It's important that we as counselors go out and do our own research. 

00:08:15
SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR COUNSELING SESSIONS 

00:08:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And despite what you might think with the idea of gay affirmative counseling. Don't label the client- 

00:08:20
Be Sensitive To Client Readiness To Identify Self As Gay 

00:08:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - prematurely with a concept like the word lesbian or gay, unless the client- 

00:08:25
Let Clients Define Themselves 

00:08:25
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - him or herself is ready to use the term or perhaps has used it in the session. 

00:08:30
Be Alert To Oppression-Related Distress 

00:08:30
DR. ANGELA JONES And often times with gay and lesbian clients, you often see depression, social isolation and suicidal ideations in therapy. So, it's important to be ah, aware of that. 

00:08:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Sure. Like, it's more likely with ah, gay and lesbian clients frequently. Uhm, as you move along working with clients- 

00:08:50
Present Positive Gay Role Models 

00:08:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - help them connect with personal models of healthy gay persons, people who themselves are functioning fully and well, and very self-appreciative about their sex orientation in general to help people find models for themselves or people like that. 

00:09:00
DR. ANGELA JONES And with that, uhm, it's important- 

00:09:05
Help Clients Connect With Support Systems 

00:09:05
DR. ANGELA JONES - that we help them affirm their support system, uhm, get out into the community and find their own chosen family within the gay and lesbian uhm, network. 

00:09:10
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  Literally, when you're doing- 

00:09:15
Evoke Internalized Negative Feelings About Self 

00:09:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - counseling work with gay and lesbian clients, do uhm, attempt to bring out internalized the oppressions... (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE ...such as self-denigration, uhm, putting self, one self down of feelings of inadequacy, bring those to the surface because they are, they've experienced ah, most of them an awful lot of oppression. (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Help positively refrain and uhm, help them find strengths in themselves. The other part of that- 

00:09:35
Allow The Expression Of Anger 

00:09:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - is in terms of bringing out the negative experiences, is bring out anger at others and itself due to the oppressions people have lived through. 

00:09:45
Demonstrate Comfort & Warmth 

00:09:45
DR. ANGELA JONES It's important that we show comfort with the client. You might wanna touch their shoulder or even self-disclose... (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
DR. ANGELA JONES ...and use humor in therapy. 

00:09:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Yeah. So, these guidelines we hope will give you a beginning as we watch the next set of ah, training sessions. Please, keep them in mind and make ah, notes to yourself if you'd like about how to help gay and lesbian clients be more fully themselves. 

00:10:05
Initial Session With An Adolescent In The Identity Confusion Phase 

00:10:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  The characteristics of individuals- 

00:10:15
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IDENTITY CONFUSION PHASE 

00:10:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - at the identity confusion phase include him or her being aware that homosexuality has personal relevance. Do to having an attraction or sexual experience. At this identity confusing phase also, she or- 

00:10:30
Feeling Different In Childhood 

00:10:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - he might have just felt different somehow in childhood. The individuals- 

00:10:35
Client Identifies Feeling As Possibly Homosexual -- Not Ready Publicly 

00:10:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - at this phase is privately identifying her or his feelings as possibly homosexual, but is not ready to do so publicly. 

00:10:45
Strategy of Denial 

00:10:45
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Finally, in response to this dawning awareness, the person might engage in a strategy of denial of his or her homosexuality, really due to the generally anti-homosexual suicidal environment and being in a sexual minority. However, it should be noted that denying homosexuality will likely be only partially successful for the person. As fantasies, crushes, attractions, and erotic dreams will interrupt that denial. Continuing denial will likely result in an ongoing self-rejection. Here's what to notice in this session. Notice the counselor gently probing for specifics, that a specific emotions and situations that trigger incidence. 

00:11:30
Emphatic Listening & Reflection 

00:11:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  Also notice emphatic reflective listening by the counselor. And her warmth and positive regard to Joseph. 

00:11:40
Alliance-Building Through Counselor Self-Disclosure 

00:11:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  Also, notice the trust building as she builds an alliance with her own showing of empathy and her own self-disclosure. 

00:11:50
Assessment Of Suicidal Potential 

00:11:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE The counselor also assesses suicidal potential in this session. 

00:11:55
Allowing Client to Move At Own Pace 

00:11:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  She also allows the client to go at his pace, but still inquires for his feelings and his situations. Going in his pace means the counselor does not quickly label nor push the client to identify himself as homosexual. 

00:12:15
Validating Confusion 

00:12:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Overall, the counselor working with the client at the identify confusion phase validates the confusion- 

00:12:20
Gently Helping Client To Increase Awareness Of Homosexual Feelings 

00:12:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - and gently helps the client to increase his awareness of his homosexual feelings. 

00:12:25
DR. ANGELA JONES  Hi, Joseph, I'm Dr. Jones. 

00:12:30
NOTE: Joseph Is Portraying Himself At An Earlier Age 

00:12:30
DR. ANGELA JONES I'm glad you can make it in today. 

00:12:30
JOSEPH  Me too. 

00:12:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Now, what brought you in today? 

00:12:35
JOSEPH  Well, (clears throat) I guess I'm here 'cause my mom made me come. Not that I don't wanna be here, but I guess that's the very reason because she made(ph) me to come. 

00:12:45
Gets Specific Concern 

00:12:45
DR. ANGELA JONES So, what exactly is your mother concerned about? 

00:12:50
JOSEPH Uhm, I guess she just, she's been worried about me because I've been depressed lately and she says that she knows something is wrong, but she, she doesn't know what it is, but she thinks something is wrong. So, (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
JOSEPH I guess I just, I've been a little more sad than I'm normally am, I guess.(clears throat) 

00:13:10
DR. ANGELA JONES  So, I hear that you sa, you're saying that your mom is really concern. She's been noticing some depressive symptoms. 

00:13:20
Directs Focus To Client, Not Others 

00:13:20
DR. ANGELA JONES Have you been noticing those symptoms also? 

00:13:20
JOSEPH I mean, I've, I've always been sad, I guess, you know, depress. I just, I guess, I'm to the point where I'm just not as good as hiding it anymore or I don't wanna hide it... (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
JOSEPH ...anymore. I just don't care if people see it or not. 

00:13:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. Well, everybody has their own de, description of what sadness is and what depression is. What does- 

00:13:45
Asks About Concrete Manifestation Of Depression 

00:13:45
DR. ANGELA JONES - depression look like to you, like tell me what type of things uhm, happened that make you know that you're feeling depress? 

00:13:50
JOSEPH  Nothing really happens. I just, I guess, I don't wanna be bothered and I just wanna be alone or just sleep and just, you know, just sleep the day away. 

00:14:05
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh-huh, uh-huh. Have your friends noticed that you've been feeling like this? 

00:14:10
JOSEPH Hmm. I mean, I don't have too many friends. I have a couple of friends, but I don't really, I don't know, I guess I don't socialize with them anymore just because of different reasons. So, I've been just keeping into myself, kind of. (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh-huh. Okay. So, it sounds like- 

00:14:30
Uses Emphatic Reflection 

00:14:30
DR. ANGELA JONES - this depression has been kinda long standing in your life. This has been going on for a long time. 

00:14:30
JOSEPH  Yes. It's been a while. 

00:14:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Okay. And it sounds like you're ah, maybe running out of the mental energy to keep it hidden or to keep it stuff down. 

00:14:45
JOSEPH Yeah, I guess I just, yeah, I don't have the energy to just hide it anymore. It takes too much energy to act like you're happy when you're not so. 

00:14:50
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, what- 

00:14:55
Probes For Triggering Events 

00:14:55
DR. ANGELA JONES - exactly do you remember what's ma, do you know what's making you feel sad or what's making you depress, specifically? 

00:15:05
JOSEPH There's(ph) nothing specifically. I guess I'm just a, a sad type of person, I guess. 

00:15:10
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh-huh, uh-huh. So, there hasn't been any events in your life that maybe have contributed or made you feel sad? 

00:15:20
JOSEPH Well, I mean, I had a, a fight with, well, not a really fight, I guess, I, I stopped talking to one of my friends, uhm, Philip. But, I mean, I guess, they didn't feel too good, but I'm sure it's getting(ph) a long run(ph).You know, I don't know. 

00:15:40
DR. ANGELA JONES Okay. So, Philip, so was he a close friend of yours? 

00:15:45
JOSEPH Uhm, yeah. He was, he was a, a close friend, but I, I don't talk to him anymore. I don't talk to any of my friends so much anymore. 

00:15:55
DR. ANGELA JONES Uhm, well, that's, that's difficult to hear because you've been a senior in high school, what I mean, during adolescence your peer group is really important. So, I would think that that's probably impacting your, your uhm, feeling sad right now. 

00:16:10
JOSEPH Yeah, but I guess like my friends they just really don't get me and they just, they're on my case a lot, and they won't let things drop. So, I would just rather not be around that. 

00:16:20
DR. ANGELA JONES  Uh-huh. So, on your case, what kind of things that on your case about? 

00:16:25
JOSEPH Well, I mean, they just, stuff like going to prom or, or dating and stuff, and they just don't understand it. Prom and stuff like that isn't for everybody, and it's not for me. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
DR. ANGELA JONES Hmm. 

00:16:35
JOSEPH And they just won't drop it, they just keep bringing it up over and over again like its gonna change my mind and they just don't understand that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
JOSEPH  it's not for everybody. 

00:16:45
DR. ANGELA JONES Right. So, it sounds like- 

00:16:45
Reframes Friend Rejections As "Being Different" Events 

00:16:45
DR. ANGELA JONES -ah, what you're saying is that your friends won't accept you for who you are. Maybe you have some differences or you think of things a little bit different than them, and they have trouble accepting that, is that what I'm hearing? 

00:16:55
JOSEPH  Yeah. That's, that's kinda how it is. 

00:17:00
DR. ANGELA JONES Okay. 

00:17:00
JOSEPH You know, I don't know. I guess Philip kinda understood, but we don't really talk anymore... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. ANGELA JONES Hmm. 

00:17:10
JOSEPH 'coz, 'coz, I know, I thinks(ph) it didn't work out. 

00:17:15
Hunch That Philip is Important But Lets Client Tell Story 

00:17:15
DR. ANGELA JONES Well, tell me about Philip. Were did you meet him, you know, like what kind of things that you all do together? 

00:17:20
JOSEPH  We uhm, met at, where I work which is just a grocery store. (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
JOSEPH And, uhm, I don't, I don't really remember how we became friends, but, you know, I guess we kinda hit it off 'coz we're both like, you know, weird in the same way, and he just got me, and I got him, but. 

00:17:35
DR. ANGELA JONES  You, you said, you both are weird- 

00:17:40
Picks Up On Key Word "Weird" 

00:17:40
DR. ANGELA JONES - in the same way? 

00:17:40
JOSEPH Yeah, I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
DR. ANGELA JONES Okay. 

00:17:40
JOSEPH  I, I don't fit in, I guess, you know, he doesn't fit in, and we're just like, I guess, weird in the same ways. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
JOSEPH And we get each other. We don't really, you know, talk about, being weird, but we just know that we have similarities, I guess. 

00:17:55
DR. ANGELA JONES  So, I wo, I would assume that, and tell me if I'm correct- 

00:18:00
Offers Positive Frame/Strength 

00:18:00
DR. ANGELA JONES - that you fitting in with Philip or you, you all being weird alike, it kinda made you feel good because the other group of friends you had, you weren't feeling like they understood or you didn't feel like you were, has similarities with them. 

00:18:15
JOSEPH  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. ANGELA JONES Was that a comforting thing for you to interact with someone who understood you? 

00:18:20
JOSEPH  Yeah, it is. But, I mean, there was a bad parts about it too, and I guess it was the bad parts that I just didn't, that's why I don't talk to him anymore. So... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
DR. ANGELA JONES  Okay. So. 

00:18:35
JOSEPH ...I'm sure, it's for the best probably. 

00:18:35
Self-Discloses "I'm Confused" 

00:18:35
DR. ANGELA JONES ...well, I'm kinda confused because it seems as if Philip ah, was a close friend of you, yours and it seems like you had a lot in common. You all were uhm, working at the same location, and you all got to talk about things and he understood you. But then you said that there were some things that weren't so good. And so, I guess, you know, it seems like Philip was a really positive influence in your life and so I'm ah, wondering why, what could have been not so good about that? 

00:19:15
JOSEPH Well, I just felt like, you know, just 'coz he, he made me feel good doesn't mean it was like a good thing overall because, I think it maybe I like him too much, and you know. And like my church says, you know, like bad associations spoil useful habits or like birds of the feather flock together, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30

00:24:40
DR. ANGELA JONES Okay. So, when it's at eight or a nine, what do those days look like or how do you feel on those days?

Alliance Building: Counselor Expresses Her Concern Reflects Dilemma With Metaphor: "Middle Zone" 

00:25:40
DR. ANGELA JONES - I feel a little concerned, Joseph, 'coz it sounds like you're in this, ah, you're in this middle zone, where you have something in your life, you had a person in your life that was making you happy, you all connected and then you also had the church, who was kind of opposed to your relationship with him. And I would think that you getting peer support or support from a friend would probably help your depression, you know. So, that makes me concerned about you not being friends with Philip anymore. Now, let me ask you- 

00:26:15
Topic Shift Toward Positive Possibilities 

00:26:15

00:26:55
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
JOSEPH then maybe, I don't know, I could deal with my friends and it wouldn't be an issue and just be like everybody else. 

00:27:00
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. Well, I understand 'coz I know during this time in your life is important for you to be some (inaudible ) to your peers. But I also see strength- 

00:27:11
Positive Reframe 

00:27:11
DR. ANGELA JONES - and individuality and you being different from your peers, 'coz we all are different in special ways. So I'm sure you have some things that are strengths of yours that maybe your friends don't have and vice versa. So, I kinda see, uhm, individuality as a good thing. 

00:27:30
JOSEPH I mean, I guess it can be. 

00:27:30
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
JOSEPH  And I really thought about it like that. 

00:27:35

00:27:50
JOSEPH Hmm, I guess since I don't go with the crowd, I guess that can be a strength. I guess I'm a leader although I'm not a leader of anybody, I guess I'm a leader of myself. I guess you could say, I don't know, in a weird way, say that. Uhm, (crosstalk)

DR. ANGELA JONES All right. 

00:28:10
JOSEPH So. 

00:28:10
DR. ANGELA JONES In what way? I mean the fact that you do a lot of things with church makes me think that you're in some type of ah, maybe leadership role there or you, you're a person that takes on initiative, uhm, to do things, so I can see that. What about the creativity? 

00:28:25
JOSEPH Uhm, I don't know, I just think I'm kind of creative. 

00:28:30

He didn't really understand, and I, I kinda hurt his feelings 'coz he didn't know why and I just, I guess, like, I didn't really know why and I couldn't really explain it. So, I'm, I'm not really sure whether or not, you know, he would wanna be my friend, I guess, the way I pushed him away just didn't talk to him anymore. And I, I don't, I don't, I don't know. I don't even know if I would want that. 

00:29:40
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
JOSEPH I mean, part of me does, but then part of me is still like, ah, I don't know, I'm not sure. I guess I'll have to think about it.

00:30:20

00:30:30
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:30:30

DR. ANGELA JONES - with your peers. And, it sounds like this whole ah, different that you're feeling or the fact that you're ah, maybe not the same as them is not as much of a burden as it was before. Is that accurate? 

00:38:45
JOSEPH Yeah, I, I don't think it's, it's bigger problem just 'coz I had, I guess, I got Philip that... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
DR. ANGELA JONES Uh hmm.

JOSEPH Okay. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN From watching these, these sessions- 

00:39:45
ISSUES TO CONSIDER 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN - think about these questions:- 

00:39:45
What Influenced The Changes In Joseph? 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN - What possibly influenced some of the changes in Joseph in session 1 and session 2? Some answers to that question include Joseph's trust in the counselor from the first session due to her warmth, her respect, her accurate empathy. Having the counselor as a bridge person while feeling somewhat isolated. The counselor affirming- 

00:40:15
Affirmation 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN - the client to be himself. Also, the client's discovery- 

00:40:20
Client Self-Affirmation 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN - that it's okay to be himself and being confirmed in that regard. Those are some of the influences of the changes that have gone on. And secondly, what's still in process? What's unfinished for Joseph? Some possible responses to that question include his relationship with his religion, his relationship with his other friend, his place in the high school social scene, his relationship with his family which is not explored here, his sexual identity that is toward naming he's being gay, finding gay role models, having a gay support system and grieving changes in the future due to his discovered identity. These are all tasks of the next phase which will be called identity acceptance and coming out. 

00:41:20
Early Identity Acceptance And Coming Out Session 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN  There's an illustration of three classic themes in a client's early identity- 

00:41:30
ISSUES IN THE IDENTITY ACCEPTANCE/COMING OUT PHASE 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN - acceptance coming out phase. Watch the counselor in this case, Cindy, helped Laura present all three themes. Notice these three:- 

00:41:40
Awareness Of Attraction To Same Sex 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN -awareness of her attraction to the same sex- 

00:41:40
Internal Confusion About Implications 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN - her internal confusion over this attraction, and her desire to disclose to the world.

LAURA Uhm, well, really just 'coz I, I don't, I don't feel like I have anybody to talk to. And I know that it's been, I mean, it's really, I really been, I feel like I've been thinking about it for, pretty much, a, a solid, a good solid year now constantly. And it's, I mean I can't go a day without thinking about it. And just trying to figure out well, what it's gonna mean for me to, you know, come out, however, I'm gonna come out as. I don't even know, like how to put a label on it. 

00:44:20
Beginning To Acknowledge Her Sexuality 

00:44:20
LAURA And I don't even know if I want to. But just where I am, and, ah, and, you know, being, being comfortable with myself enough to be comfortable with telling other people like my family and my friends, I mean, I don't, I feel like that this is such a big thing that I've been going through. I don't wanna, I don't wanna keep that from them. But I don't know how to say anything, really.

Counselor Probes For Client Use Of Support 

00:45:20
CINDY JENKINS Okay. Okay. Uhm, here around the uhm, the school, here on campus, have you noticed anything around the campus that might, uhm, you know, offer some type of support? Ah, have you noticed, uhm, any activities like the groups that are going on here, right here on campus? 

00:45:40
LAURA Hmm, I did see there was a table at the activities fair... (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
CINDY JENKINS Uh hmm 

00:45:45
LAURA ...uhm, and they had a, a gay student group. 

00:45:50
CINDY JENKINS Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
LAURA Uhm, did it really, I don't know. I really, it really didn't look like- 

00:45:55
Not Ready To Fully Identify As Gay 

00:45:55
LAURA - there was a lot of people involved. And I wouldn't wanna be, I don't know, I mean I guess I could talk to them, but I don't really feel like that was the kind of people that I'd really want to be confused with... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
CINDY JENKINS Okay. 

00:46:05
LAURA  because, you know, they may all be confused and it just might confuse me even more and, I don't know if I'm ready to walk around campus and you know, show it just yet. I feel like I wanna, I feel like that would be a little too, a little too far from me right now. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Laura, in this short segment, was further along in her awareness of her same sex attraction than it was Joseph. She's ready to declare her attraction to women, or to come out to both herself and now to the counselor. However, she's not fully comfortable with claiming a lesbian identity as her own. 

00:46:45
Initial Session With Client In The Beginning Of The Identity Acceptance/Coming Out Phase 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN  Next, you will see a fuller counseling session. One in which a client, in this case, Vanessa, who was also in the early identity acceptance coming out phase explores the implications of her new identity. One of the counselor's tasks is to help the client acknowledge and express the grief of that expected blueprint for life and thus to move beyond the sense of loss so that it doesn't become chronic. This task can be helped by the counselor's probing client feelings about her homosexuality specifically, around family, friendships, work and religion. A second related counselor task at this phase is to help the client forge a positive gay identity by seeing positive role models, helping the client connect with the gay community and help the client come to an appreciation of who this part of her is. Here's what to notice in this session. The counselor assesses the client's clarity about being gay. And the counselor affirms the client's sexual orientation. The second theme is the counselor proactively points the client to gay-related resources so that the client can firm up a positive gay identity. And third, the counselor helps the client to meet the world with her new identity especially through discussing telling her family about her sexual identity.

VANESSA ...or what's going on with that. Or just. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE So, so I'm hearing something in you is calling, in a sense. And it sounds maybe pretty automatic or, uhm, maybe even natural- 

00:49:50
Counselor Points Out Discrepancy 

00:49:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - but then there's some part of you says something taught you somewhere in the past that that wasn't okay. 

00:49:55
VANESSA Hmm. 

00:49:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And that's, ah, kind of, ah, a conflict going on within you about that. 

00:50:00
VANESSA  Well, first of all, I was raised Roman Catholic... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Okay. 

00:50:05
VANESSA  so that really tells me that it's not a good thing- 

00:50:10
Notice Important Messages From Religion 

00:50:10
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
VANESSA - to be attracted to someone with the same sex. And so, right away I like put up a red flag for me saying this is wrong... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
VANESSA ...and try not to identify this way(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
VANESSA ...and so, it's really hard for me to feel that and then know how I really feel... (crosstalk)

00:50:25
VANESSA  inside.

GARRETT MCAULIFFE You wanna have a clarity for yourself... (crosstalk)

VANESSA And so I was trying to figure out why I was so depressed and... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
VANESSA ...and how I could change that and make it better. 

00:51:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Yeah.

GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uhm, not who you had to pretend to be. 

00:52:00

00:52:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE - kind of clearer. Sounds like you are getting clearer, is that correct? 

00:52:10
VANESSA Well, when I went to the social that one day, when you came in. 

00:52:15
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Yeah. 

00:52:15

VANESSA ...or talking to my parents. 

00:52:30

00:52:30
VANESSA I felt like I was hiding something with them. 

00:52:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm.

VANESSA But when I went to the social, it felt like- 

00:52:35

00:52:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm.

VANESSA ...one from that is transgender and she hangs out with them and talks... (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm.

VANESSA ...out for me. 

00:54:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:54:50
VANESSA So, but now that she has these friends, I think that she would be more accepting, but then again, it's hard to say that because they're not her child. 

00:55:00
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

00:55:00
VANESSA They're not her only child. They're not... (crosstalk)

01:05:25
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And I, I would invite you for us, you know, if you'd like to continue to work.

01:09:25
Follow Up Session With Vanessa 

01:09:25
UNKNOWN  Vanessa now addressed that the developmental task- 

01:09:35
Task: Disclose To Significant Persons In Her Life 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN - of disclosing her sexual identity to significant persons in her life. This is an important risk to take. 

01:09:40
Precede Disclosure By Having An LGB Support Network 

01:09:40
UNKNOWN  The prior step to coming out is also to develop a support network of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons as Vanessa has done. 

01:09:50
Hoped-For Outcome: Increased Self-Esteem 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN  If this disclosure goes well, the individual is likely to feel more positively about being gay. However, if he or she receives a negative response, he or she will be further confirmed in a negative view of being gay. 

01:10:05
Counselor's Role: Who, When, How 

01:10:05
UNKNOWN  The counselor can help a client in who to tell and when and how to tell them. This is what occurs in this session.

01:10:40

01:10:40
VANESSA I think I was talking about Mathew Shepard or something and... (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
VANESSA ...she really touched me in a way because she said something like, "I can't believe those people did that to him because God loves everybody." 

01:10:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
VANESSA And that really spoke to me and I was like, "Wow, she thinks God accepts gay people then." Obviously she would accept me 'coz I'm her child. So that made me feel very confident... (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

01:11:05
VANESSA ...and I got a little emotional about it.

01:19:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
VANESSA But I'm pretty sure it'll be the same way how... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Okay. 

01:19:40
VANESSA ... they'll be accepting. And ultimately they, they still love me so. 

01:19:45
GARRETT MCAULIFFE So, it felt like it might be a little bit like what it would be like to tell them. 

01:19:50
VANESSA Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE I didn't play it like they were, uhm, more difficult. 

01:19:55
VANESSA Right. 

01:19:55
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And many people do have very difficult situations with their parents. 

01:20:00
VANESSA Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And are parents were not likely to be as accepting as yours. 

01:20:00
VANESSA  Uh hmm. 

01:20:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And so I, I didn't wanna make it too easy for you.

01:20:20
VANESSA  I just really wanna do it. 

01:20:25
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Okay. 

01:20:25
VANESSA So, I think it's just gonna be something that I have just to grit(ph) and bear it and see what happens. 

01:20:30
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Yeah. It sounds like there's no right way to this there's no... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
VANESSA Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
GARRETT MCAULIFFE ...script and so I suppose if you just do what you just did and whatever words come out, uhm, that's all it was needed in this situation. 

01:20:40
VANESSA Uh hmm. 

01:20:40
Suggest Mental Preparation 

01:20:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE And I guess one thing to tell yourself, I'm gonna suggest something, is to, uhm, to remind yourself, "You know, this who I am. I'm still their daughter... (crosstalk) 

01:20:50
VANESSA Yeah. 

01:20:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE ...they're still my parents, that doesn't change... (crosstalk)

01:21:05
VANESSA Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
GARRETT MCAULIFFE ...or whatever it gets carried off. 

01:21:05

01:21:40
GARRETT MCAULIFFE Good luck to that. I think you'll do great. 

01:21:40
Allows Client To Explore Feelings & Meanings 

01:21:40
UNKNOWN  What you have seen in the first session is a counselor who was supporting or holding a client in her very new approach to a lesbian identity. The counselor does not avoid the issue, but also does not push the client. The client here named her attraction and explored the implications of that same-sex orientation. 

01:22:05
Points To Gay Resources 

01:22:05
UNKNOWN The counselor also intentionally pointed to gay resources including positive gay and lesbian models. 

01:22:10
Helps Client To Come Out 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN  In the second session, the counselor helped the client come out to important people in her life. 

01:22:20
Later Tasks May Include: 

01:22:20
UNKNOWN  Later tasks for the client will be- 

01:22:25
Taking Pride 

01:22:25
UNKNOWN - to take pride in her lesbian identity through further socialization with persons who are gay and lesbian. 

01:22:30
Integrating Identity 

01:22:30
UNKNOWN  She might then eventually, if all goes well, integrate her sexual orientation with her total identity. That will require positive contact with supportive heterosexuals also. 

01:22:45
Challenge: Being In A Sexual Minority 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN However, the societal oppression of people who are in a sexual minority will present her with a lifelong challenge. 

01:22:50
GARRETT MCAULIFFE  Gay-affirmative counseling is rooted in a fundamental belief that homosexuality is natural. It stands alongside heterosexuality as an equal partner. It's a variation on a theme, not an aberration from a standard of heterosexuality. We ask you to claim that attitude as your own. Perhaps this video will help in that regard.
