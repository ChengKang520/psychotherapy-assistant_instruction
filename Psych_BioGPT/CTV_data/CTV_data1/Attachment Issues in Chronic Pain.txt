RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone, welcome to our Networker series Attachment Theory In Action. I'm your host, Rich Simon, editor of the Psychotherapy Networker. In this series, we're exploring the practical implications of the attachment theory. Research, the venerable research tradition within our field, stretching back to the work of John Golby, at least, stretching back 40 or 50 years ago, and more recently what's happened is that there are a whole range of applications of attachment theory. It's moved from an academic framework for understanding human development to a source of inspiration for a range of therapists doing very different kinds of work, different kinds of problems, clinical populations, and that's what we're exploring in this series, and today we're very fortunate to have someone with us who's going to guide us through an understanding of chronic pain from an attachment theory perspective, and it's my pleasure to introduce our guest today, Maggie Phillips. Maggie, how are you? 

00:01:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Hi, Rich, I'm doing great. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON Maggie's the star of stage and screen, and presents all of the county and the world, and my, I'm constantly receiving emails about the latest developments and latest news of what's on your training schedule. 

00:01:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, thank you for inviting me. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON Great. So, Maggie, you began with, your interest in chronic pain began with, it seems like it's very linked to your early interest in hypnosis. 

00:01:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yes. 

00:01:50
RICH SIMON Tell us a little bit about how one led to the other. 

00:01:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, I started studying hypnosis, it was my first path of study, really, as a mental health professional, back in the ‘70s, and I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. I got to know Steve Gilligan and people like that who were very connected with Milton Erickson, so I began to study Ericksonian hypnosis and psychotherapy and found that very rich and exciting and then moved on to medical hypnosis and then to clinical hypnosis, which is more psychotherapy based, but as I moved through those different pathways, I got very curious about how we could apply hypnosis to many things, and one of them was pain, and I found that really what we know is true today even more so, because we have the body of research, but in my own practice I found that just about everybody had a good response to hypnosis, whether it was indirect conversational hypnosis, or whether it was a trance state, deep trance in some cases, where the person could really go back to a memory of what their body felt like when they weren't in pain. That was just one way that was very helpful to people, so I got started early on, and then later, I got, had an interest in studying trauma, as I think the whole field became immersed in it, and I particularly was interested in dissociative disorders, which sort of dovetailed with my study of hypnosis, and then I began, I'd say 5 to 10 years ago, I started getting alot of referrals of people who were having very intense pain that had persisted for quite a while, in some cases many, many years. They weren't responding to much of anything, and they're referring sources, for the most part considered them untreatable, or at best that they were really stuck, and they couldn't make any progress, so I took it as a challenge, really, and as I have taken many things in my life as a challenge and I enjoy that. 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's, so for today, let's put this in context. I know in your work, you have, there are a number of, as you understand, as you like to refer to the layers of chronic pain, and the roots of chronic pain are not of which are related to attachment issues. Let's quickly, if you could, before we get into talking about attachment theory, and how that informs your work with chronic pain sufferers, just quickly outline these other sources of pain, so we don't give the impression that you think that every time there's chronic pain, that it's an attachment issue. 

00:05:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yes, that's very true. First I will say that I've been hugely influenced by Peter Levine. He and I met back in the ‘70s, we taught together. I was then sort of providing the hypnosis part, he was providing the sympatic part, when it came to treating trauma of all different kinds, and we had stayed connected and have just completed a book called Freedom From Pain, and in that book, we talk about what we think is the missing link to treating chronic pain or atypical or really persistent pain, and that is unreleased trauma. That is trauma in the body that has not been released, that has been held there, in some cases for many, many years, and causes localized pain problems, as well as systemic ones, so what we outline in the book, and what we believe is that there are basically four levels or layers of trauma that apply to chronic pain. The first one, and where most clinicians would start, is what event precipitated the pain? 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:06:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Was it a fall, was it an accident, was it an illness? So we want to really explore that, and not just the details, but the body's reactions to the experience, and the second one usually is to understand how the trauma, excuse me, how the pain has become traumatizing to the client, so its become a trauma in of itself, because the client is feeling unsuccessful, feels helpless, feels depressed, usually has many chronic pain patients have anxiety disorders, and often I treat the pain as with those folks as an anxiety disorder, which is helpful, and then we have earlier trauma that predates the onset of the condition. So this is where attachment comes in. I used to work my way back from the current time back to the past. Now, I will take the brief history of the pain and then the traumatizing effects of the present time, and then I'll go back to early attachment, and I'll be getting into that, of course, as to why later on, but there I'm looking for, is there a history of neglect, a history of abuse, abandonment, loss, was there disorganized, chaotic attachment in the case of parents who, themselves, were traumatized? And then I look at how does that affect the person's relationship to their pain and to their body, of course, and it's also going to affect how they relate to me as a treatment provider, and so if I pick those pieces up, what I've found is, I can become more effective from the very beginning, instead of staying with things that are important, but not as central to the treatment relationship, and then the final fourth layer is, makes common sense, is just other traumatic events, that between the early attachment time and the time that the pain began, there're traumatic events that may be linked in the nervous system to what's happening now in terms of pain. 

00:08:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so what we're trying to do in this series is give people a fly on the wall view of skilled clinicians who are coming at the range of issues with attachment theory as a construct, as in some way informing in a very practical way how they approach a certain kind of client or a certain mode of psychotherapy, so can you give us, maybe you've seen a case recently perhaps, that could give us a flavor of how you from a first session- 

00:09:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON What do you do? What do you say, the kind of questions, how you, just take us through, if you could, the story of how something kind of came together for you and the flavor of an early intervention with someone who's had an extensive history of chronic pain. 

00:09:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's a great question and I have just the perfect person. 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Alright, alright, alright. 

00:09:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS This is a man who's in his 70s. He is from another country, but has lived in the United States for about 40 years. He had, was referred to me by his, I think he sees like a Feldenkrais practitioner and has for a number of years to work with some of his body issues, and she contacted me and wondered if I could see him while she was on vacation, so I have him for a month, this month, and so I saw him for the first time, and what I, I'm just struck right now by what I used to do, which is I would used to do is get a long trauma history and delve into every nook and cranny to try to flush out all the trauma to see what was there that we were going to have to contend with, and instead, what I talked to him about was, I said, ‘Well, tell me what your relationships have been like throughout your life.’ That was almost my first question, and so he started telling me about his father, who, this man was in a camp during the war. He was with his mother and sister, sisters, and his father was in a separate camp, so he lost touch with his father very early on. So there's a clue, and- 

00:11:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)A camp? When you say, just to clarify. 

00:11:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, it's a prisoner of war camp. 

00:11:30
RICH SIMON Okay, and where was this? 

00:11:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I'd rather not tell you exactly where, but it was- 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)It was in Europe in- 

00:11:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Europe. 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON Europe, okay. 

00:11:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS During Word War II, so he doesn't recall, nor does he name any traumatic events in particular while he was in the camp, but what he remembers is his relationship with his mother, which was pretty awful, and he. I said, ‘Well, give me an example of, it was awful, what was it like?’ ‘Well, she would say to me, well, she would look at me and say, well, there must be at least half of you that is a good person, because you're my son,’ which, is, I said, ‘Well, what does that mean to you?’ He said, ‘Well, she was telling me I was just like my father, and she detested my father.’ I said, ‘Uh-huh.’ So that was the second kernel of information, then he told me that when his mother remarried, his stepfather joined his mother in allying against him, he described himself as a scapegoat, and based on what I heard, it does sound as if that might have been the case. He was blamed for everything that went wrong in the family. In alot of families, you find stepparents have trouble aligning with the biological parent, sometimes, in giving a united front. In his case, oh no, they were very well aligned, to the point where he had no sense of a separate relationship with the stepfather, so that was another piece. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON Let me just ask if I may, now his, was chronic pain the primary presenting difficulty? 

00:13:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's why he was sent to me, and I didn't, like I said, in the past, I have often started with the chronic pain and gotten a careful history and all of that, and I just thought there was something about the way that the referring person presented him, in a sense that she had careful, I mean she had gone through every possible piece of trauma and explored it with him and tried to look at, to work with it through the body. She had come up with different treatments for pain, none of which had worked, so I had all this background information. 

00:14:05
RICH SIMON And what was the pain that he was complaining about? What sort of pain was it? 

00:14:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)He has severe pain in his chest. It's all of this is probably iatrogenic. He's been tested alot, and they haven't found anything that would lead us to believe that there's a medical condition that needs to be treated, but at different times, the way he experiences the pain in his chest is that he's having a heart attack, or he's getting ready to have a panic attack, or he's dying. There's that piece in there, too, and he also has gut pain, and that has been treated, mainly through diet. He refuses medication, he doesn't want to even consider medication at all, and I don't feel like my job necessarily is to bring that in, but rather as a consultant, to look at what needs to be added here so he begins to get some relief and resolution of this. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Okay. Alright, so you're exploring this territory that you've been describing to us, and what's going through your head, how are you thinking about this? 

00:15:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Attachment trauma, attachment trauma, attachment trauma. Now hear this, attachment trauma, and when I hear that so strongly, of course I take that in, and I'm then going to keep listening to see whether there's further validation, because I don't want to just say, ‘Oh, well, I'm sniffing attachment trauma here, and that's what its got to be.’ I think you you have to be really careful about not bringing your own biases in, so I asked him some other questions. We got away from any relational questions and into things like what was school like for him, but interestingly, he immediately started talking about the relationships, that he didn't have any friends, that what he remembers being taught in school was some variation of that's a problem, so fix it, and so that's his style in terms of addressing anything. Here's the problem, fix it, and if you can't fix it, there's something wrong with you, and so there's another little piece of the pie there, too, which is something that feeds into his relationships. He can't figure out whether he's the one that's causing the problems or the people he's choosing in his life are causing the problems, and I just said, ‘Well, what if it's both? There are two people in a relationship, it's probably both, but let's look at your side.’ And so he was willing and went all the way through, talked about his marriage, which I would say was a mystery to him. He got married, he had a daughter, he doesn't know why it worked in the beginning, he doesn't know why she agreed to marry him, and he doesn't know why she wanted a divorce five years later. Unfortunately, he lost connection with his daughter as part of the divorce. He didn't understand that at that time and in that country, he would lose custody if he signed the divorce paper, some part of the divorce paper was for that, and the way, I didn't say this to him, but the way I heard it was that's how far relationship was off of his radar screen. He wasn't thinking well wait a minute, what about my daughter, and how's that going to work? Not a thought in his mind. His daughter visited him periodically, not very often. He thought it was a successful connection. She, of course, thought it was abysmal and cut off contact with him when she was 25 and really has been hospitalized for mental illness and has not had an easy time of it. So, he has not remarried, he has not had another significant, intimate relationship. He has friends, but as he will describe his friends, he'll say, ‘Well, you know, I can be around people, and I can like them, but I don't feel connected. I don't feel connected at all, and that's what's wrong is that I need to feel full inside. I've never felt like I had something inside me that was worth having.’ And- 

00:18:55
RICH SIMON So, as you're hearing this, and you're hearing this story, and then this is a disconnected person, and there are all kinds of ways in which this manifests itself. As you're, from your framework, and your interest in chronic pain, an in your interest in understanding the connection between that and these attachment issues, as you're beginning to think, how am I going to be of help to this person, what is it, how do you begin to think about that? How do you begin to formulate your ideas about working with such a person? 

00:19:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, I started talking to him about the connection between his pain and the lack of connection he was describing in his relationships, just to see if he would agree with me, because again, that's my theory, and I'm testing it out. 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON And how does that sound? What kinds of things might, how would you discuss this with him or with any client? 

00:19:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I said something like, ‘You know, it sounds like you really feel pain about your lack of connection. Not just now, but throughout your life.’ And he immediately said, ‘Yes, that's right.’ He said, ‘And,’ he said, ‘You know, nobody has ever put it to me that way, before, but I can see how my lack of connection, my inability to connect underlies everything.’ So I didn't certainly expect to get that much of a confirmation, but there it was, so- 

00:20:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And so is that something, so in your way of working with people with physical pain, that's something, that particular formulation about using that charged kind of language, and connecting the idea of pain with lack of connection is something that is characteristic with you work with certain clients? 

00:20:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh yeah. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:20:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, I tend to I guess we could say, I tend to dive in fairly quickly into the main issues, and I asked him, I said as we were going along I said, ‘How's this feeling to you? This is the first time you've met me, how is this conversation going for you?’ He said, ‘Well, it's really interesting.’ He said, ‘I've never had anybody talk to me like this.’ So for some therapists, they might be a little anxious about that. For me, that lets me know I'm on the right track, because if you just think about neuroplasticity, you can, we used to talk about the placebo effect, and that's still a factor also, but now we know more about neuroplasticity, and we know that somebody is really going to come alive if you present something that's new about a problem that's so very, very old, and they feel so hopeless about it, so that's why- 

00:21:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So that's one of your, great, so that's one of your first session goals. 

00:21:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Oh yes. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Is to find some formulation that this person has not heard before, and get their attention with that, and get them to warm to the prospect that maybe something different can happen. 

00:22:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's right, then they start talking about, as he said at the end of the session, ‘Well, I'm surprised, but I feel hopeful already.’ Great. That's what I want to hear, and it's never, it's not formulaic for me as to how I'm going to offer that new information, but my goal is to have that new information that becomes a container for everything, the symptoms, for our relationship, for anything that's going to happen, and so in this case, we started out with lack of connection as he's owning that that's his problem, and that he doesn't know how to have it, and then we're sort of as we continue talking, we're building, building, building until it includes everything that we begin to work on. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON So by the end of that first session, this is somebody who you've seen several times now? 

00:23:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Once. 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON Once, okay, so where, by the end of, tell us, is there more to describe in the first session? 

00:23:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Oh, yeah. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS There is. He, as time went along, I started talking about the emotional pain that must arise from a lack of connection, to see if he could make that connection, he said, ‘Yes, I understand that.’ And he just went off into anxiety. ‘I get so anxious sometimes, I just don't know what to do with myself, I don't know, everybody else seems to have a life and I have a life that's full of busy things, but there's, but they don't mean anything, because I don't feel anything.’ So then I started talking about emotional numbing versus emotional pain, and I said, ‘If you've had experiences that you describe to me that are filled, as I listen to them, filled with emotional pain, of not being seen, not being claimed, not understanding what in the world is going on, and the other person not understanding or seeing or knowing you, in some cases feeling rejected, and by your daughter,’ and I just sort of laid out this pathway of emotional pain, experiences, and he said, ‘Yes, that's right.’ He said, ‘I don't really let myself feel it, but I know that that's there.’ And I said, ‘Well, it seems to me, so I'm about halfway through this session now, I want you to begin to bridge toward experiential work,’ because that's something else that's different about me is that I will, I want to give the person a new experience at the very first session that we can build on, and it doesn't mean that I'm going to ignore his his history, I mean I've gotten quite a bit in our conversation, I usually tell him, ‘Well, I know there's more for you to tell me about your history.’ And he said, ‘Well, you know, I'm so tired of telling those stories.’ I said, ‘Well, I understand, and I'm going to ask you questions if there's something missing for me, that I feel like I need to know about.’ He said, ‘That's fine.’ And I said, ‘But I know you came here because you wanted things to be different. You want to have a new experience, you want to feel different. And he said, ‘Yes.’ And so I said, ‘Would you be willing to try a short exercise?’ And he said, ‘Sure. Sure. Yes, that's what I want to do.’ And he studied quite a bit of psychology, actually, which is a bit interesting, because it's helped helped him, and it's also gotten in his way, I would say. Both were true. So I asked him to just check in his body and tell me what he was feeling there, and so he mentioned the chest pain, he said actually, I said, ‘When did it, were you feeling that when you came in? Is it a constant or did it just start at a certain juncture?’ And he said, ‘It started when we started talking about my daughter,’ And I said, ‘Hmm, so what do you make of that, that it started right when you were talking about your daughter?’ He said, ‘Well, I think it confirms what you are saying, that because I've struggled so hard to have a connection with her, and I don't have one, and I don't know how to have one, and now it's too late, I think that's where I feel alot of pain.’ So he, there, was making the connection between the emotional and the physical, which was- 

00:27:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Which he had not previously, so your thing just a moment ago, with all of his history and psychotherapy, no one has really bridged these two domains of pain, and then, what's he's picking up very, and this is a gentleman who's in his 70s, you were saying? And his daugher is- 

00:27:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)70s. I'd say it's mid 70s. 

00:27:25
RICH SIMON His daughter is in her 50s? 

00:27:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS The daughter is in her 50s, and she's, she lives in another country, and he has no contact with her at this time, he contacts, he gets contact through other relatives that are peripheral and let him know what's going on, but it's not good news, so anyway, I asked him to tell me about what is that kind of pain in your chest feel like? Sometimes I ask the question if I wanted to have that kind of pain, what do I need to do? 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Oh, wow, that's an interesting, now what went into your formulating it in those terms? I don't thinK I've heard that one before. 

00:28:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, it's a good one, because it really helps the person access the unconscious. To answer that question, they have to access their unconscious awareness of everything. The pain and how it feels now, but where it came from, what maintains it, everything. So, I find it's a huge, you get alot of information out of that one question, and- 

00:28:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)In terms of novelty of getting people to describe something familiar in a new way, it seems like it's- 

00:28:40
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON Quite a powerful tool. 

00:28:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS You're right, Rich, I think it's really connected to, it's another neuroplasticity question, as it were, so he, it was very interesting. He said, ‘Well.’ He started telling me about the sensations, it was tightness, it was constriction, it was this, well, you know if you're going to have it. He didn't really answer the question as clearly as some clients do, but he said, ‘Well, you have to have pain both in your chest and your belly, but they're different kinds.’ I said, ‘Okay, so tell me the difference.’ And he said, ‘Well, the pain in my chest feels like it's armor, it's like something like pushing down on me, it's weighting me down,’ and I said, ‘What about your belly?’ He says, ‘It's kind of churning, it's churning, it's probably that I'm afraid of something, I'm scared.’ And then he says the statement: ‘I need my mother.’ And I just, everything stopped. I thought wow, okay, where did this come from? Is it what I'm doing with him, that he's saying oh my god, I need my mother, save me from this? Or is it we're getting too close to scary territory, or is he really putting it together, and he's offering that as the next step? 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON And what's the tone of voice, as if a younger self saying it or is this, is he in character? 

00:30:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS No, he was saying, he said it very dismissively, he said, ‘I need my mother. And years ago I went to the unitarians, the this, the that.’ He very quickly got away from that, and I think what he was describing is that he's been on a search, probably his whole life, or certainly his whole adult life for a mother in the archetypal sense, someone to help him understand and soothe and connect. 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)I see, so he's connecting with his religious search, as if sort of a sophisticated guy sort of standing back and saying, ‘Oh, I've needed my mother, I've gone to religion.’ 

00:31:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)I've gone to this. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON Okay. What an interesting jump for this gentleman to make. 

00:31:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Right. So then I said, ‘Well, you know, we do connect through meaning, so I see why you've gone on your spiritual search, the Unitarians, the Buddhists, the,’ I said, ‘And I think, though, what may be needed is that we need to help you expand your way of finding meaning, because have you found the meaning that gives you a sense of connection that you want to feel?’ He said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘That's what I thought. So is that something you'd like to work on with me? Especially as it relates to your pain, the pain in your body.’ He said, ‘Oh yeah, sure, absolutely.’ So then we went on into the experiential work, which I could tell you briefly about, if you want to- 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:32:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Because I think it illustrates- 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And maybe if we can just give people the flavor, so if there's something, some way I can, we can do it together, I can have the privilege of being your client, however you want to do this. You tell me. 

00:32:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS So you might just, you Rich, and those of you watching and listening, you might want to just focus on your chest, you could think of it as your heart, you can think of it as your chest, or that certain area that's in the middle of your body, and feel any sensations that are less than neutral. So they might be tight or achy, they might be gripping, they could be clenching, they could be heavy. And so do you find anything like that, Rich? 

00:33:00
RICH SIMON It feels like, it's kind of like a rhythmic feeling, almost like the ocean. 

00:33:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Like the ocean? 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, as- 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Like waves. 

00:33:10
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yes, okay. 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON It's not an unpleasant feeling, but it's not a neutral feeling. 

00:33:20
MAGGIE PHILLIPS It's not a neutral feeling, it sounds like a positive feeling. 

00:33:25
RICH SIMON It feels positive, yeah. 

00:33:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Okay, so in your case, what I'm about to suggest might help you amplify this even more. In his case, I'll tell you what he told me, and then those of you listening can use this, regardless of where you are, if you have neutral sensations, if you have positive ones, this may help amplify. If you have negative, quote, or uncomfortable ones, it may help you with that, as it did him. So what he told me was, ‘I feel nothing but this kind of constriction, this uncomfortable heaviness, this pain right now, that's all I feel.’ And I said, ‘Okay, so I'd like you to put both hands right over your heart or your chest, one on top of the other, where you feel it, and now what we're going to do is breath in and as you breath in, I want you to press down gently, so we'll do it together. Breathing in, pressing down gently, and then breathing out and letting go. Okay, and again, breathing in, pressing down gently, breathing out and letting go. Breathing in, pressing down gently, breathing out and letting go. And so, Rich, what are you feeling right now? What's different? 

00:34:55
RICH SIMON Well, it's a very soothing feeling, there's a little mother thing there. There's something, you know, the universe is missing back here. It feels like at a very basic way, something very comforting, a soothing life force feeling. 

00:35:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's wonderful. That is wonderful, and what happened for him was he said, ‘I feel warm.’ 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:35:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I said, ‘Wow, you feel warm there?’ I said. Sometimes I'll get into pushing the envelope a little bit, just testing, and so I said, ‘Are you sure? You feel warm?’ He said, ‘Oh yes, oh yes, I feel warm.’ I said, ‘Okay, well, that's really important, that's really important, and let's see if we can take something you would like to feel more connected with in this warm way, and tell me what that would be.’ And so he told me about this little cat that comes from next door, the neighbors, and he usually sends the cat to the bowl to get food, but he also lets the cat come up next to him, and then he'll stroke his fur, so I said, ‘Okay, so can you think about the cat, stroking the cat right now, and feel it?’ And he really, really struggled with that. ‘No, no. No, no. I see the cat,’ And I said, ‘I know you see the cat, but can you just imagine stroking the cat and feeling the softness of the fur?’ And he finally, what helped him was to close his eyes a little bit, so I said, ‘Yeah, that's good.’ He naturally closed them a little. I said, ‘That's good instinct. Go ahead and close your eyes, and you open them again if you want. Whatever feels right.’ So, I said, ‘Okay, now I want you to think about the cat, and stroking the cat, and put your hands back here, again, and now we're going to do a second set of breathing.’ So you can do the same thing, and we're going to breath in, and actually before we start, think about something that you would like to feel, Rich, this kind of connection with, that you're just describing. It's flowing, it's mother, it's soothing. So it could be a person, it could be anything. And those of you listening, do the same thing. Is there something in your life you would like to feel more of a positive feeling about, and that's what we're going to do now. So, here we go. Thinking about that in a way, a longing for feeling more connection, and so breathing in, pressing down and thinking about that warm connection you want to have, and breath out, and let go. Let go of your hands and body and everything, and now let's breath in two more times. So breathing in again, focusing on that important connection for you, and then breathing out and letting go. And one more, breathing in, feeling that connection, thinking about what you want, and then breathing out and letting go. Okay? And what he said, I asked him again, the question is what is different? At this moment?’ And he said, it really was stunning, he said, ‘I feel relief.’ I said, ‘relief? Wow, that's really important, isn't it? If that's a place of pain for you, relief.’ He said, ‘Oh yes,’ he said, ‘But I feel more than that.’ I said, ‘Okay, what else?’ He said, ‘Joy.’ He said, “I'm not sure if it's actually joy, but this is the first time I've ever felt anything anywhere close to joy.’ And I said, ‘Well- 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)This is the first time in this entire life of feeling? 

00:39:15
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That I ever remember feeling this. I said, ‘Well, let's just call it joy, maybe we'll use a little j, because we know you can have bigger and bigger joy. We're just getting started here.’ So he was happy about that, and he says, ‘Okay, well that's great, I'm glad I can feel connected to this cat, now,’ and I said, ‘Yes, and each time you see the cat, now, you're going to reinforce that, that connection will grow,’ and he said, ‘But I don't-’ He said, ‘But my real problem is my art.’ He said, “I paint, I sculpt, my teacher tells me I'm excellent, but I've just dropped out of the studio with him, because I'm so burnt out, I'm exhausted.’ I said, ‘What's exhausting you all of a sudden?’ He said, ‘Because I'm just going through the motions, I'm not feeling any connection to what I'm doing, what I'm creating.’ I said, ‘Well, I can see that is a problem.’ I said, ‘So let's just try one more thing today, and that is choose a piece of art you want to feel connected to.’ So he did, and we did this same exercise, and what he told me was, he said, ‘Well, I feel lighter, and I feel relieved again.’ He said, ‘I think this is what people mean when they say connected.’ I said, ‘Well, I wouldn't be surprised, I think you're right on top of it there. I think that's good.’ So then I made him a recording, and he's going to just go through those steps that we just did. It's very simple, you start first with whatever sensations are there, and then you do the breathing, and then what's different. Then you go to what is something that you want to feel connected with that you don't feel connected with, and then you add that in, and then the third one is something that's even more challenging, once you master the first set. So that's an example of how I build a protocol with a specific client, so it's using breathing to begin to connect with the body, but then also to bring in visual information, cognition. What is it that you want for yourself? What is it that is already in your relational field that you may not even be aware of or you feel dead about, and then we go from there. 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON So if, and so you at the end of this first session, this fellow has had a bunch of first time experiences, very different way of both thinking about what the issues are in his life and this experience. If you stand back from this and see how does that fit into what you envisioned may be the treatment with this fellow and where you might go from here, can you just give us a sense of what this larger process might be like? 

00:42:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Sure. What I do after the first, sometimes it's the second session, before we get a set of experiences that give me enough data that I can look at and say, ‘Okay, I think we're on the right track for this person in terms of what they want. They're telling me yes, this is what I want, this is what I want more of, this is what I've always wanted, or whatever.’ Then we can build from there, and what I do to build is I have in recent years used the polyvagal model of the polyvagal model that Stephen Porges has written about. You and I had a conversation about that, and I know my comment when I talk about it to clinicians, and they want the reference to his book, I'll say, ‘Good luck reading that.’ It's not easy reading, it's very dense. I can read maybe a page or two at a time. There are more accessible articles online, so I would send anybody to those, because I think it's really important that in this field that everyone knows about- 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)But if you were to streamline for us and save those of us who are not inclined to read this material, what's important? How does this, how does an understanding of the polyvagal nervous system help you in this practical way with a client? 

00:43:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS I know, it does seem like a long gap there. Basically, what it does is give you a model of how you can create permanent change by working through the nervous system, and changing the wiring in your neural circuits, that's really what it's about. He took, we all know about the parasympathetic and the sympathetic system, and the sympathetic system is what's connected with fight and flight, and the parasympathetic is connected with rest and then in an extreme, in its extreme case when it's turned on too long, the person goes into freeze and numbness and depression, so we've known that for a long time, but what we didn't know was that the vagal nerve, in addition to weaving through the sympathetic and parasympathetic, it weaves through other structures, as well. I'm not going to name them all, because it's way too complicated for our time 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON I appreciate that. 

00:44:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)You'll be glad. 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)On behalf of our listeners, okay. 

00:45:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS But basically the ventral vagal system is connected to attachment. It's the nervous system component of attachment and the wiring that happens there, and so that's why I know that we've already in his case, we've dealt with fight and flight. There was one time when I didn't mention this, but when he expressed very clear anger about his daughter, about his wife, his marriage, and I labeled that, and he said, ‘Oh, you bet I was angry,’ and I said, ‘You still are,’ and he said, ‘Yes, I still am.’ So there's the fight, then we talked about flight. He had anxiety alot, fear. He talked about some fear in the camps long ago, but that was not really quite close to the surface, and freeze in terms of his life is immobile. I mean, he's just not, he's dropped out of the only thing that really gave him any kind of pleasure, which was his art. So he's frozen in his life. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON So in terms of just continuing on and kind of give us, in a practical sense, this understanding of the polyvagal nervous system may inform what you do. What are you likely to do here, what's your, what would be in your treatment plan? What's, he's had this experience- 

00:46:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Yeah, and I'm looking for, okay, he's already connected to the sympathetic fight flight, Porges calls it the sympathetic adrenal, same kind of thing. He's already connected to freeze. He's definitely just in there already. What is missing? It's the attachment, so if I know that, then I'm going to work from the ventral vagal point of view, I'm going to focus on corrective experiences for him that include connection with himself, connection with other people, connection with me, and I asked him at the end of the session how was it for you to meet with me today? And he said, ‘Well, it certainly was different.’ Yes, it certainly was. I said, ‘It was for me, too. Is there anything more you can tell me?’ He said, ‘Well,’ and that's when he said, ‘I feel hopeful. I feel like I'm going to learn something here,’ and- 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So specifically the sorts of things, like if you think of this over the next few sessions with someone such as this, what, how do you think about, what is it that you hope, what in a concrete way, when you think ahead, are there certain experiences, are there certain exercises that you're thinking about, do you have a certain sense of how you would like to be with such a client, or things that perhaps you want to emphasize that are part of your style with such a person? 

00:48:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, for one thing I know I'm going to use breathing exercises, because for somebody like him who's pretty disconnected from his body except for these constricted areas, he needs to open up different pathways in his body, so I'll be using more breathing exercises. I have probably 15 or 20 of those that I teach people, depending on what's relevant, and if people listening want to know about those, they can find them in Reversing Chronic Pain, that was my first pain book, and then this new one which is Freedom From Pain 

00:48:45
RICH SIMON Freedom From Pain, okay. 

00:48:45
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Freedom From Pain, so they both have alot of breathing exercises in them. 

00:48:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:48:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And some of them are more relational, so in other words, I made this one for him to be relational, because I started talking about what would he like to feel connected to? 

00:49:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That he never had before or he wasn't connected with, so for somebody who was, let's say, terrified, if that was the issue, and I have actually a client I can talk about briefly. Is there a brief moment? 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, we have, you know, we have more or less five minutes to go. 

00:49:25
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Oh, okay. 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON So if you go, give people a kind of a larger view, you've given us a very vivid sense of how you're having an impact in the first session with a client, just in the time that we have, so just people say, ‘Oh, okay, that got off to a strong start.’ Where does she go from here, and what's sort of the longer view of what this kind of work involves? 

00:49:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Right. Well, I have a client, that I'm sure people will resonate with this, that, you know, really if I'm honest about it, when I, in the first two minutes of interacting with her, just talking to her, listening to her, I either move into a places that's pretty neutral or even hopeful. Neutral to hopeful, or else I'm gritting my teeth and thinking, ‘How am I going to get through this hour?’ This is somebody that has back pain, again, she has some disc involvement, but it's not to the point where she should have a discectomy or any kind of surgery, it's not that kind of thing. It's more like a slight bulging of the disc and so forth, and she's had these stresses and strains that have led to the point where she's become rigidified. She can't drive anymore, because she's, that stresses her back. Everything stresses her back. Her marriage stresses her back, I mean, so I, what I have done with her, and it's taken alot of time, but I've brought in the attachment piece, because, and she's now in couple's therapy, that was not my suggestion. She started moving in that direction, realizing, okay, you need to do something here, and it really is more than just me, but what she does is she gets very helpless and collapses, and it's almost like a whining child at about the age of three or four, when she starts going about her pain and she's just had a flare up, and nobody wants to help her, and nobody cares and this, that, and the other thing, and so what I do very gently is I have learned to talk to her about what happened to her and her family, and what happens in her family, I said, ‘I just want to remind you this is very much like what you and I have talked about in your family, where you're feeling out of step, you don't feel like you belong, you're different from everybody else, and in a negative way. You can't keep up with everybody else, you can't keep up with your husband and his interests and where he wants to go, and it's really so very painful,’ and that's pretty much all I said, and she immediately dropped into this state of, I don't know what to call it, resonance of connection with me, and she said, ‘I'm so glad you reminded me of that, I keep forgetting that, and you're right, and so what do we do?’ And I said, ‘Well, my question is what do you do?’ I said, ‘How are you going to help get that child inside of you that is so, in so much pain, and so distressed, because nobody will care, nobody will comfort. How are you going to comfort and soothe her when you didn't receive that, yourself?’ It's a huge question, but now I've got her interest, and so we went on and basically I gave her a little exercise. She's pretty good with imagery, so I said, ‘Let's see if you can create or construct an image of that part of you that goes into that inconsolable place, and see what, how you can respond. Don't try to change anything, just let it unfold, let it happen, and then we'll talk about it the next time we meet.’ That's much more of a long term case. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON And also in the previous conversation we had another tool that you often use is partchwork, I think you have another term? 

00:54:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Ego state therapy is what I call it, that's the hypnotic model of working with parts of the self. We call them ego states, and it basically came from Eric Burns parent adult child, but there's another lineage through Freud, it's not important to know about, but that's how I was trained, so- 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So the idea's that there's a part of the self that is in some ways carrying the pain, and you're trying to find some ways where people do not have a means by which they can soothe themselves? They don't have a part of them has not developed yet, and so part of the work is teaching them, setting up the circumstances where they can bring that part forward, and perhaps learn for the first time how to have that kind of relationship internally? 

00:54:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right, exactly, and it's very important, I think, to seed and grow these inner relationships as much as it is the outer ones, so I'm also, whatever else I'm doing, I'm looking at how we get the inner attachments, as well as the outer attachments, and community, and marriage, or whatever else to be much more hopeful and relieving of what is painful. 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, so you're working both way, you're working with these external relationships and within the person. 

00:55:30
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON So we just have a few minutes, and so you've opened the door here. You've introduced us to the way both you think about pain and it's connection to attachment theory, and also you've given us a detailed picture of at least with one client the way that you proceed in the first interview. If people want to find out more about your work, where do they go? 

00:55:55
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Well, I'm happy to tell them. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Okay, great. 

00:56:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Please come to my reversing chronic pain workshop, which is reversingchronicpain.com has an online self help program for anybody who's in pain, there's ten modules, each one teaches a skill. For example, relax, breathe, feel, so it's very simple, and I've gotten very, very good feedback from people, and also I have a little bit of data, it's soft data, but among the people that I have studied who have completed the program, I'm not counting people who didn't go all the way through it, it's about 85% improvement in their pain condition that lasts over time, so it's good, and the also my- 

00:56:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Give us the link to that one again, Maggie. 

00:57:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS www.reversingchronicpain.com 

00:57:00
RICH SIMON Oh, wow, okay. 

00:57:00
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Right there. The other one that's important is my website where it talks about me and what I'm doing, but also gives you there's a free newsletter monthly with an article by me and teleseminars monthly. This particular month I'm doing one on attachment focused EMDR with Laurel Parnell, so you can tell that really is something that I am pursuing these days. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON That you really embrace. 

00:57:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS Maggiephillipsphd.com, that's that site. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, alright. 

00:57:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS And then the Reversing Chronic Pain, the Freedom From Pain book, I don't know if you can see that. 

00:57:45
RICH SIMON Hot off the presses, your, if there are bookstores anymore, but available through Amazon, you know. Okay. 

00:57:50
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That would be great. 

00:57:50
RICH SIMON Great, and so those people, if you're to again, the important conversation is what happens following these interviews, so you'll see the comment board, take a moment. What occurs to you, put into language for your own benefit and for the benefit for all of us. What stood out for you about Maggie? What new stuff, new perspectives, new ideas emerged from this? What questions did you have? Maybe reminded you of a particular case, whatever it is, please share that with the rest of us. Maggie has agreed she will pick out our comment board if appropriate, she may very well respond to you. 

00:58:35
MAGGIE PHILLIPS That's right, I sure will. 

00:58:40
RICH SIMON Well, Maggie, thank you so much for giving us such a vivid picture of the kind of work you're doing, and the difficulty of people who, really working with people who've in chronic pain for many years and giving them a really very new pathway to explore possibilities of new healing. Appreciate it. And learned alot, and thank you for this lovely exercise you led me through, that's real powerful. 

00:59:05
MAGGIE PHILLIPS (crosstalk)Thanks, Rich, been a pleasure. 

00:59:10
RICH SIMON And for now, that's it from our attachment theory in action for the moment. See you next time, but for now, goodbye.
