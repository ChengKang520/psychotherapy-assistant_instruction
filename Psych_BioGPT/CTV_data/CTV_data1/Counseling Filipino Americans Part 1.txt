KEVIN NADAL , Ph.D. Assistant Professor and Author of Filipino American Psychology Hi, my name is Dr. Kevin Nadal. I’m the author of the book Filipino American Psychology, a handbook of theory, research and clinical practice. Today we are going to be watching some videos with some Filipino American clients. Our first client that we are about to watch is a Filipina American student, who is in college and is struggling with managing her course work as well as some of the stressors that she experiences with her family particularly her mother. I mean you watch this video I want you to pay attention to some of the techniques that I might use to get the Filipina American client to connect with her feelings um… as we might know Filipino Americans have the difficulty connecting to emotions, not only in identifying them, but in talking about them and exploring them further. And also just pay attention to other ways that I try to build a rapport with this client and… and try to get her to think about her presenting problem into you know help her with her journeys. So I hope you enjoy the video. 

00:01:30
Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Kirkland 

00:01:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL So Kirkland tell me what brings you in today? 

00:01:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Oh so, I’m here just to talk about some things that I have been struggling with, ah… I have been thinking a lot about my decision to forgo my pre-med career ah… so this based… this decision happened last semester and I thought that I was at peace with it, but it seems as though it’s still… it’s still on the back of my mind and when I’m alone I kind of think a lot about it and it makes me feel really down. 

00:02:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay and let me just get a little bit more information, so what you’re you at in school and what was your, what was your major and what is your major now? 

00:02:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So I’m a third year undergrad at NYU and I used to be a bio major on the pre-med track. 

00:02:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And now I’m a Psych Major Public Health Minor and I’m planning on going into nursing after ah… I get my Bachelors in Psych. 

00:02:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Can you tell me a little bit about what your decision entailed? 

00:02:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Sure. Well, last semester I went through a really tough few months. I knew that I wasn’t happy on the pre-med track. Ah… I knew that it was something that I didn’t wanted to do, but disappointing my mom wasn’t… didn’t feel like an option for me so I kind of forced myself to go through the classes and do all these things even though they’re all making me miserable. 

00:03:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But yeah and after I actually went to counseling and that sort of opened my eyes and… and my guidance counselor kind of said you know, “When you… When you get up the courage to talk to your mom about this I really feel like she will be supportive” and it turned out that she was right. So when I talk to my mom about um… about how miserable pre-med made me… 

00:03:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO She was really-really supportive so that was great, but um… yeah it’s still… 

00:03:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, but you said now that there are some other feelings that you are having, can you tell me about those things? 

00:03:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Well, I can’t help feel a lot like a failure kind of… it’s, it feels as though it’s something that I wanted to achieve, but couldn’t and um… you know my guidance counselor kind of said, “It’s not that you are stupid or anything like that, it’s just that it’s not what you wanted to do and there is… there is nothing wrong with that, but there is still those feelings in the back of my mind, that’s kind of like oh! 

00:04:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:04:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO You’re a failure and… 

00:04:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:04:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And yeah and my mom says she is really proud of me and um… and that she is totally supportive of… of my decision to not do that anymore, but I feel like some more inside of her she is disappointed. 

00:04:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… yeah. I mean I’m hearing a couple of things and first of all I just want to say that I think it’s great that you decided to go to counseling not just once, but twice in order to talk a little bit more about you and how you are feeling and then trying to understand a little bit better. So I think that that’s definitely a strength than I (inaudible ) you on that um… and then the second piece is that you know, it sounds like there are a lot of factors that are going on behind this decision making and um… it sounds like one of these factors may be your family particularly your mom so can you just tell me a little bit more about your mom and may be anyone else in your family that you might live with? 

00:05:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Ah… I just live with my mom, my dad actually passed away. 

00:05:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:05:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… a few years back. But they… they were divorced when I was younger, so and… and it was sort of like a messy divorce. 

00:05:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:05:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So we were basically estranged from him. 

00:05:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:05:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And news of his death was actually another… 

00:05:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:05:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …another affair. But I feel as though I’m expected to do… I’m… there is a lot expected of me… 

00:05:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And… And most of that is from myself. 

00:05:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:05:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Because I don’t want to bring more pain and disappointment on to my mom, because I feel as though she has done so much for me and she has gone through so many… 

00:05:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …negative things and I just don’t want to add to that, but it seems as though I do anyway and that’s very hurtful to me. 

00:06:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right I mean it sounds like you’ve been through a lot of these past few years and… and to have this other thing that, it seems like might be overwhelming for you. 

00:06:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO A little bit, yeah. 

00:06:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I noticed you got little (inaudible ) when you talk about this how… 

00:06:22
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I know… 

00:06:22
DR. KEVIN NADAL …how are you feeling right now? 

00:06:22
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I had a weird day, I mean it’s a very stressful week too because there is a lot going on, my Filipino club has an event this weekend and um… I’m kind of one of the forerunners of this event and I’ve been planning and planning for the past several weeks and I feel like I’ve got no sleep so and my stress level is super high. 

00:06:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So and I think I’m gonna get on, get my period. Can I say that? 

00:06:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, you can say that. 

00:06:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But yeah. 

00:06:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:06:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So I feel emotional. 

00:06:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. So it sounds like you are this… there is a lot of stuff happening. 

00:07:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, definitely. 

00:07:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL And it also seems like you’re trying to fight back the emotions. Can you tell me a little bit about what you are feeling right now on the moment? 

00:07:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Uh… I don’t talk to people much about how I feel and what’s going on. So I guess I do about all things up a lot. So when I actually do talk to someone or someone is actually willing to listen… 

00:07:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Everything just kind of like waterfalls out. 

00:07:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So yeah. I definitely feel like coming. 

00:07:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure yeah, and tell me a bit about you know, what are some of the reasons why you don’t talk with anyone? 

00:07:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… I think it’s my mom is that way. 

00:07:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO We don’t… We don’t talk about our feelings much and… and I think it’s… it’s on my side too. I’m… I’m a very proud person, I don’t like… 

00:07:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I don’t like talking about my feelings or seeming vulnerable in anyway. 

00:07:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And in some way I think that’s ah… a reason why I don’t really make very good friends very easily, because I don’t… I don’t open up. I don’t… I don’t really like hanging up my dirty laundry… 

00:08:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… yeah. 

00:08:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …so to speak. 

00:08:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… I mean it sounds like that you know, it’s not only is it hard for you to, (inaudible ) counseling, but even to talk about your feelings is something that sounds very difficult for you to do and again you’re doing it right now which shows that some strength and… and I’m really glad that um… you took this… this step to come in here. You know, and I’m also hearing just how there is this idea that we are not supposed to have our feelings and… and you know as you know, I’m Filipino too when I saw in your intake that your Filipina and um… that’s a very Filipino thing to do which is for us to really bottle things and not talk about things until it gets really bad. Is that something that… that sounds familiar with you? 

00:08:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, absolutely. Along with that feeling of not wanting to um… be vulnerable in anyway… 

00:09:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …is… is this idea that like the (inaudible ) idea you know, like I don’t want… I don’t want to seem like I’m lacking in any way… 

00:09:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …because that reflects back on to my mom and my family. 

00:09:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So yeah. 

00:09:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. You mentioned (inaudible ) which obviously we both know means shame. 

00:09:21
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Right. 

00:09:21
DR. KEVIN NADAL What does that feel like for you? 

00:09:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… I think this concept makes me feel as though I have to seem a certain way in front of other people and because sometimes it’s so difficult to do that, I find myself tricking myself into thinking on a certain way and then when I’m alone just thinking I realize no, I don’t feel happy or I don’t feel proud I just… I just feel sad and I’ve been bottling that up for so long that it surprises me when I admit to myself. 

00:10:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. It sounds like it’s really hard to be vulnerable. Yeah, you think and you’re being very vulnerable right now? 

00:10:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah. 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL What’s it like right now as you talked with me. 

00:10:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… strange. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Definitely um… the first time I went to counseling I remember my first session I was like silent. 

00:10:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So, um… to talking to people in general feels weird and I feel like I can’t particulate my… my feelings properly and that frustrates me too. 

00:10:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But… 

00:10:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, but again I’m glad that you… you’re at least taking that risk and challenging yourself to do so and I want to get a little bit more information so you said that that you live with your mom and… and do you have any siblings or anyone else that live with you? 

00:10:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO No, I’m an only child and I think that adds on even more stress, because I feel as though I’m the only one my mom has and most of our family still lives in the Philippines. So, we are kind of in this bubble and I feel like she is lonely and things like that and like yeah, it’s hard. It’s hard to feel that I’m disappointing her in anyway. 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right and added bonus of being the only child means that… that there is extra pressure for you. 

00:11:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Like all her attention is on me, so… 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, yeah. So as you talk about this idea of being the only child and the added pressure that you feel. Tell me a little bit more about this… this pressure. 

00:11:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Hmm… like I said before it has a lot to do with not wanting to disappoint my mom and not wanting to make her go through any negative feelings like I don’t want to make her sad or… or anything that because I feel like I owe her a lot. 

00:11:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I feel like she sacrificed so much and she works all the time and that’s because of me. 

00:12:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And I feel like she doesn’t give herself a lot of time and she doesn’t take care of herself and all her focus is on me and I do appreciate that, but in some ways it… it… it does give me a lot of stress. 

00:12:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… yeah. I mean it… it sounds like about what when (inaudible ) we prefer to as (inaudible ). 

00:12:26
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Right. 

00:12:26
DR. KEVIN NADAL …this and that, that we have to her parents. 

00:12:26
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah definitely. That definitely resonates to me. 

00:12:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and… and almost it feels that to feel some of your individualistic feelings and to think about these needs sometimes can be really difficult for us to do because we are so concerned about our families and our parents and making sure that ah… that we are taking care of them first and making them proud in your case here. Yeah and what’s it… what’s it like having to like you said trick yourself into you know, people thinking that you are happy and even tricking yourself into… to being happy. Tell me about that process what’s that like for you? 

00:13:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Sure. Well in the morning sometimes I’m just so tired and I just wish that I could just stay home and the whole ride to school and I’m really cheerful, I mean I’m really down and… and just sleepy and tired and then the second I step foot to a classroom or when I see my friends like I have, like an instant smile and I… I get cheerful on the drop of a hat and sometimes that surprises me. 

00:13:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Because I know how I’m feeling on the inside yet I can like the millisecond that I see someone I know I can smile at them as though nothing is wrong. 

00:13:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, like an on switch almost. 

00:13:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, definitely. 

00:13:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and then you continue to… to put on that mask until that you’re no longer with them and then does it switch off? 

00:13:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO It does, sometimes and sometimes it switches off when I get home and then I feel bad because the (inaudible ) of my anger… 

00:14:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Is on my mom like something throughout the day, stress me out or made me upset and I bottle that up until I get home and then I explode and my mom and I get into a fight. 

00:14:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And it’s like that’s the complete opposite of what I want to do, but sometimes I just can’t help it. 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well tell me a little bit more about your relationship with your mom and what’s it like? 

00:14:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO We used to be really-really close… 

00:14:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …which is unfortunate and I feel like throughout the years we’ve kind of drifted. 

00:14:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And I guess that sort of like a natural thing that happen, but I wish… I wish in this case that I was an exception, because we are (inaudible ) so I wish I was a better daughter basically and I wish that our relationship is better. 

00:15:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. You… You say, you wish that you’re a better daughter as if it’s you have blaming yourself in some way and I wonder if that’s… if that’s the case here. 

00:15:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah. I mean I feel like… I feel… I feel like it is somewhat my fault. I mean… I mean I… I feel as though what she has gone through is so much more than I have, I feel like… 

00:15:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …she is, she has experienced much more than I have, everything bad that I feel happen to me, it’s kind of just like secondary to what she feels. I’m not articulating this right. 

00:15:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But she is kind of gotten the worst of things and I’m kind of just… 

00:15:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …I’m kind of getting what’s left of it. So, when I… when I feel sorry for myself, I feel guilty for feeling that way because I know that she has gotten through worse. 

00:16:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right and again you are always thinking about her feelings and what she has gone through. Yeah, you know and that she talk about your relationship with her. You… You talk about how you wish it was better, but then at the same time you’re… you’re fighting all the time and then at the same time you feel like you owe her so much and you love her so much and it sounds like there is a lot of feelings going on. So… So tell me a little bit about your feelings in your own words what… what are some of the things that you are feeling this, you think about your relationship with her? 

00:16:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Just disappointed that it is what it is. 

00:16:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And wishing that it was different and wishing that our situations wasn’t what it is, like I know it sucks that she is a single mom and I’m an only child like I… I feel like there is no freedom for either of us. 

00:17:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So I… I just feel… I just feel like it’s our relationship is lacking and it could be so much more. 

00:17:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. When did you notice the shift in your relationship? 

00:17:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Hmm… I’m not sure. 

00:17:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I mean, I feel as though, I just remember a time when everything was good and I just know what, how it is now and I can’t really say for sure when the definite change occurred. 

00:17:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL It just something that… that happened through time without you’re not recognizing that it was happening? 

00:17:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Right, yeah. I think so. 

00:17:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. How often do you fight with your mom? 

00:17:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Not… Not that often, but we kind of just ignore each other. Like… Like we live in a very small apartment and we kind of just walk circles around each other like when I’m in the living room she make sure she is in her room… 

00:18:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …and things like that. So yeah, so I mean I think that’s even more hurtful than… 

00:18:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …us fighting. 

00:18:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO At least if we are fighting we are kind of communicating. 

00:18:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But now it’s kind of just like, I mean there was a time when we fought a lot. 

00:18:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And that was the time when I was really struggling with, you know, with the pre-med thing. 

00:18:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And now it’s just… there is just nothing and I feel like that’s worse. 

00:18:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well you know as I’m sitting here listening to your story and trying to understand everything that you are going through, you know I just think that there is just… there is a sudden overwhelming amount of emotions you know they can and even some… some things that you know conflict with each or… or that they add it… add to each other like this feeling of disappointing your mom, feeling guilty you said earlier too and… and then at the same time you know you are not necessarily having the best relationship with her, so you want to… to put her needs above your own and make her proud, but then your relationship is one that it is something that you feel disappointed with. 

00:19:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Right. 

00:19:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. What’s that like to recognize that the kind of conflict or the toward… maybe not a conflict, but these two things are happening at this… at this same exact time. 

00:19:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I… I feel as though I don’t know what I want. Sometimes I feel like I want freedom from her and then there are other times when I… I want to be close to her, so there is like that push and pull… 

00:19:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …that I don’t understand and what happens is I do things or say things that are counterproductive to… 

00:19:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …to what I feel would make me happy. So it’s strange like there are times when I just want my independence and I just want to stay out late without her texting me all the time, but there is also this feeling of not wanting her to feel worried or anything like that. So yeah, there is definitely like these conflicting feelings that… that I… that I can’t articulate well. 

00:20:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. You know, this is our first session I… I want to get a little bit more information from you. I just want to know about your everyday life. Like what happens when you wake up in the morning, how are you feeling and as you continue through the day, what it… what is the day of Kirkland’s life look like? 

00:20:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I wake up pretty early because I’m a commuter. 

00:20:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So, um… so it’s and I’m not a morning person, so when I woke up I’m already tired and like when I leave my house I’m already exhausted. So that’s, that’s not a good way to start things, but um… and then I got to class and then, I spend a lot of time with my Filipino club because um… there they keep me on my toes and they keep me cheerful. So I appreciate their company and because of the club I’m… I’m on the executive board, so I’m one of the officers of the club so, um… there are times when I have to stay, stay in school really late. So that keeps me away from home um… and then I… I work at undergrad admissions on campus so I go there. So it’s like class, work and then the club and then home again very… very-very late and when I get home I… I pretty much go straight to bed. 

00:21:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL And walk those circles around your mom. 

00:21:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, basically. 

00:21:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. So you know it sounds like you have a really busy day and maybe you are not at home even a lot with your mom and… and that must be you know stressful or you might have some feelings about that. Can you tell me a little bit about what’s it like to recognize what your day is like? 

00:21:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO It’s hard and then I think, I feel as though I’m not doing enough towards the more important thing then I feel like I don’t know how to prioritize and it's like I am busy yet, I… I don’t know how to put the more important things first. 

00:22:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Like sometimes I find myself dealing with club business instead of doing my home work or things like that and you know I tell myself oh, this is because this is what… this is what makes me happy this is what I… I think is fun, but in the back of my head I know that I shouldn’t be doing that, I should be focusing more on my school work and I… I recognize that… that I should be focusing on my school work more and yet I don’t. So I’m yeah and sometimes when I don’t do well in a exam, I feel like I feel not upset at not doing well. I feel upset that I don’t care. 

00:23:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So it’s… it’s strange. 

00:23:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:23:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO That was a stranger thing I just had. 

00:23:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. No, but I understand what you were trying to say like it sounds like this… this Filipino club that you are a part of it something that actually brings you happiness. 

00:23:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, absolutely and actually it… it became an issue because my mom was like you’re always you know coming home late and I don’t see you’re doing your homework and you say you are doing work at school, but I feel like you’re only doing club stuff so… 

00:23:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:23:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …what are you doing and… and… and it became kind of a big deal and I kind of told her well this is what makes me happy and she kind of just backed off. 

00:23:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And, but then I… I kind of think back on the conversation and I realized well she can has the point I should… I mean she is not sending me to this expensive school because to be in this club, she is sending me here to do well in school so… 

00:23:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:24:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I feel guilty about this thing that I love. So it’s so that’s stressful too. 

00:24:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. You know I… I that since… since this is our first session I… I do want to get as get to know more about you and ask some… some other questions. Um… can you tell me a little bit about what your sleep is like, is it difficult for you to sleep or or you… do you find yourself over under sleeping? 

00:24:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… I… I never feel rested. 

00:24:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:25
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I never feel as though I’ve got enough sleep. 

00:24:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And I roll around in… in my bed for a pretty long time before I can even get to sleep and I feel as though my thoughts are racing every night and I always try to be in bed by midnight, but I definitely don’t fall asleep until way afterwards. 

00:24:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I’m not sure exactly at what time, but I do know that I kind of roll around a lot. 

00:24:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and how much… how many hours a night do you usually get to sleep? 

00:25:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I get about six hours of sleep which seems like a lot. 

00:25:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But it doesn’t feel like that or I often get those dreams where I wake up. 

00:25:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And then… And then I wake up for real and… and then I don’t feel rested because I just lived an entire day in my head. 

00:25:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:20
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So, so yeah. I get that often. 

00:25:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… yeah. So we only have a few minutes left Kirkland and… and I am glad that you are able to come in here. I mean I just wanted to check in with you and see what was it like for you to talk with me and… and share some of these very personal experiences with me. 

00:25:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… at first it was hard, but it seems as though I needed to a lot some of these thoughts and feelings out so yes, so that was, it feels good. 

00:25:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:25:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I mean personally I don’t like talking about my feelings, but this seems… this seems comfortable and this seems okay so… 

00:26:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:26:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I feel good. 

00:26:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay and… and then something that we can work on in our work together. It’s just um… being able to… to understanding the some other reasons why it’s difficult for you um… to connect to these feelings and even just for us to pay attention to when you feel these… these various feelings, how is it affecting your life with you knowing it or without you knowing it. I also want to just ask about maybe some of other pieces in your life, are you… are you feeling tired throughout the entire day and I also I want to know a little bit about your eating habits. How are those going for eat, what are… what are some of the… the ways that you eat or how often you eat and then what’s your energy level like throughout the day? 

00:26:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO I eat pretty much three meals a day. 

00:26:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And I’ve been kind of trying to cut down because I… I find myself overeating. 

00:26:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:50
KIRKLAND ESCONDO But um… in terms of my energy level, I drink a lot of coffee and I kind of try to swear off coffee but… 

00:27:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:27:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …it’s I… I… I just need it to get through classes sometimes, because a couple of my classes are three hours long. 

00:27:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:27:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And it’s just difficult to stay up especially one of them is in the middle of the afternoon. So, I just need a cup of coffee. 

00:27:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:27:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… but yeah, I don’t feel tired all day, but I know… I know during the early afternoon I know that I’m gonna feel a little bit… 

00:27:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:27:30
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …exhausted, so I’m gonna drop a cup of coffee and then feel better after that. 

00:27:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. Well thank you for coming in today. I hope that you can continue. 

00:27:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Sure thank you for having me. 

00:27:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah and I’m… I hope you can continue to come, how does that sound to you? 

00:27:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Yeah, that will be great. 

00:27:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay thanks Kirkland. 

00:27:45
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Thank you. 

00:27:50
De-Briefing of Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Kirkland 

00:27:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL So Kirkland what was it like to talk with me today as a client? 

00:27:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Because I don’t really like talking about my feelings it was hard at first, but it got better throughout because it seems as though I really didn’t need to talk about these things… 

00:28:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:28:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …so at the end of it I feel… I feel a bit, I feel comfortable. 

00:28:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and I know that you know, you’re actually experiencing these real emotions and… and even though we might not be in long term therapy together, ah… that… that it seem like it was real and I wonder even what was it like ah… expressing those feelings especially if you and… and it coming out in your tears and ah… when perhaps it’s not something that you think about very often or you don’t express very often. 

00:28:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Well, since… since I did feel myself get… get physically upset. 

00:28:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:28:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Um… I think that just tells me that I do need to think, to talk to someone about these things so I mean it’s making me realize that maybe I do need to you know find the friend that I trust and talk to them, because… 

00:28:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:28:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …if… if talking about these things makes me wanna cry then may be… 

00:29:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:29:00
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …maybe I need to do something about that. 

00:29:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. I mentioned a couple of Filipino values throughout the session and what was it like when we’re able to talk about that and for me to identify those actual values. 

00:29:15
KIRKLAND ESCONDO It’s good, because it’s making me put a word to this abstract feeling that I have. It’s kind of making something that abstract into something concrete that I can understand then talk about with more… with more accuracy I guess. 

00:29:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:29:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO So, I… I think that’s good. Um… framing those… those thoughts and feelings into something I can understand. 

00:29:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, and… and what was it like when I asked you about your everyday to… to think about your sleeping and your eating and all those other things? 

00:29:55
KIRKLAND ESCONDO It… It was a little strange and difficult for me to explain, because it’s just something I don’t really think about going to bed or waking up in the morning, but I mean maybe it’s something that I… that I should be more conscious of. 

00:30:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:05
KIRKLAND ESCONDO And see if my patterns change or… 

00:30:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:30:10
KIRKLAND ESCONDO …anything like that. 

00:30:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah and… and I guess I one thing that I was just really thinking about is um… how a lot of times Filipinos, and Filipino women specifically and you know just people of color generally tend to express ourselves in… in more physiological ways and… and maybe we might not be able to talk about our feelings, but it may come out in our sleep problems. 

00:30:35
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Right. 

00:30:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL And… and eating problems and… and that sort of thing. So I… I just wanted to get a sense of that um… with you. So thank you very much for being a part of the session. 

00:30:40
KIRKLAND ESCONDO Thank you so much thanks for having me. 

00:30:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Welcome.
