MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Hi my name is Matt Englar Carlson and I'm the host of the Counseling theories in action video series. Theory is the compass that allows counselors to navigate the vast territory of clinical practice. In the same ways that navigational tools have been modified to adapt to advances in thinking and ever expanding territory so explorer, theories of counseling have changed over time to integrate advances in science, to adapt to the broad range of presenting concerns and most importantly to be more inclusive of the full range of cultural identities that our clients embody. We do know that counselors adopt and practice according to one theory or another because their experience and decades of good evidence suggests that having a sound theory of counseling leads to greater therapeutic success. A sound theory helps the client and counselor makes sense of a client's experiences and they're presenting concern. Theory also guides actions towards successful outcomes while generating hope and both the counselor and client that recovery is possible. There are many different counseling theories and that wide variety is a testament to different ways in which the same human behavior can be conceptualized. But also the different ways that counseling can be practiced. This video series presents different theoretical approaches to counseling with the emphasis on different theoretical based interventions. The viewer will get a chance to see how professionals make sense of their chosen theoretical model and also then observe that model in action.

MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Hi, Er. 

00:01:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Hi, Matt. 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON In this video you're gonna help us learn six interventions from Adlerian perspective. Before we get to those techniques, I wonder if we can learn a little bit about you and about why Adlerian is the theory that you choose. 

00:01:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Right. Well, I'm an Associate Professor at the University of San Diego in the counseling program there. Umm… Before I became a counselor educator, I was actually a school counselor for about 10 years. 

00:02:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Mm-hmm. 

00:02:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And really loved it and I worked primarily with I was at a… I've done the K through 12 experience so I've been in elementary counselor, middle school counselor, high school counselor and before that I was an at-risk counselor and worked with umm… students who were technically kicked out of high school. Umm… And were coming back to get their high school diploma. And in that experience, we're needing umm… more than just kind of normal (inaudible) counseling. They were really struggling with not only coming back to school but then also other traumas uh… addiction use and so I used all of that to become a counselor educator and to work with bugs. Adlerian for me umm… is really important and I bring up the students, the at risk students because a lot of their trauma really started early in their life when they were younger. Uh… When a… I love Adlerian because there's a modality to it that allows me to be a bit creative. Umm… It really focuses not on the deficit of a person umm… but really looks at how they can build themselves up. 

00:03:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:03:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And to figure out what their goals are and what they find as well and I found that in my counseling, it's really helpful especially when I was working with children and adolescents but even with adults that because things happened so early on in their experiences that they can actually make changes. 

00:03:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:03:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And feel well sooner. 

00:03:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. Well, I think it's sometimes we talk about theories and you know, do counselors really choose theories? Or the theories gonna choose them? You know, it sounds like in some ways Adlerian kind of chose you because the hopefulness. 

00:03:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yep. 

00:03:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON And the ability to actually make some change in life as opposed to being fixed with something that is… is from your childhood 

00:04:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Oh, completely. I'm… if you'd asked me when I was a school counselor what theory I would've chosen. I probably would have said CBT. And I think the only reason why is because everything umm… that with the children I was working with and umm… in special education everything was so behaved really driven. 

00:04:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:04:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so when I went to do my PhD, I was given a book on Adlerian therapy. And it actually what's your father's work. 

00:04:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I was (inaudible), I was like this is the… this is what I embody and so it… it really chose me. And so it's been great. 

00:04:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So sounds like in a way you had these early experiences umm… which you expose you to kind of the work in working with clients and students. But in your PhD program has when you really got… got fully exposed at learning ideas. And when you're at kind of training you receive become more knowledgeable about Adlerian therapy. 

00:05:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, so of course in my master's program and then again in my PhD program there was a theory score. 

00:05:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:05:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it was talked about and it was hard though for me to kind of decipher what truly was me. 

00:05:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:05:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And even though I went through a master's program and I thought I was a CBT uh… counselor umm… I really you in that PhD program really started to really assess who I am and I also you know, being a young adult, I grew. 

00:05:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:05:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And so I think my theory like my understanding of myself really influenced what theory was right for me. 

00:05:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:05:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I also had the privilege of having a mentor who is… is an Adlerian. 

00:05:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So that helped as well umm… and then through working with him umm… I actually attended the Adlerian conference. 

00:05:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And what's just around people of like mind and really we're embodying the work and it just it fit and it was amazing. And so that's where I've really hung on to be in an Adlerian and I like, probably say it. So it… it's and it… and it has been, it's been uh… reading and training and videos and all of that… that I've really grown to use Adlerian at my work more often. 

00:06:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON This sounds like you really became a student of it. And then how these exposure experiences surround yourself around Adlerian, 

00:06:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, yes very much so. 

00:06:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Kind of like my life too. So being exposed to lot of Adlerians well and realizing that the way they… they view the world with very similar the way that I view the world too. 

00:06:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, very much so. You know, it's really, you know, thinking about things like birth order. 

00:06:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:06:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Or striving and having goals umm… that to me just clicked and made sense. I was an athlete back in the day and, you know, everything was goals, you know and we were always working as a team and so that ability to… want to be "a with people" and kind of "how do we connect", really has been a pattern in my life. 

00:07:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:07:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And to find a theory that actually fits that really made me kind of feel like I found a home. 

00:07:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:07:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And made me feel really confident as a counselor to be grounded in something, the one thing though that I had that "aha!" moment was I was reading this Adlerian counseling book and it talked about being a technical eclectic. 

00:07:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:07:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I, you know, I always was like eclectic… can't be eclectic but it gave me permission to be a technical eclectic and to really use my Adlerian principles and be able to incorporate other modalities or other theories into that as long as there was a… rhyme and a reason for it. Like, I just was like, oh the wind blew and I'm gonna do something. 

00:07:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:07:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But it… that really made me feel good. It made me feel like I had a little bit of freedom and flexibility to be myself. 

00:08:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:08:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so that's what I really like about Adlerian that I have that flexibility. I'm… I'm not necessarily tied to a protocol. 

00:08:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:08:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so it allows kind of my creative side as a person and a human to really connect to who I'm sitting across from. 

00:08:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, that seems important that you can be you with the model and you also have these different interventions techniques that you can use. 

00:08:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:08:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON You feel like you're being consistent many ways. 

00:08:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, yeah. And being genuine and real. 

00:08:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, I think that to me is the most important thing umm… in a counseling session is just that ability to be real and connect to others. And it's very similar to I think with Adler coming out of Freud's camp and making his own and really starting and connecting with people. 

00:08:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:08:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And wanting therapy to be with people. 

00:08:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:08:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And for me that really was empowering and also where I kind of had my roots. So it was really to connect with people and help people. 

00:09:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So as a counselor, working from Adlerian perspective what are you assessing and looking for in your client? 

00:09:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I'm really looking for what they feel is their sense of wellness. 

00:09:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I'm also looking for what their goals are in therapies till I don't necessarily go into a session umm… saying, you know, they have this issue and they need to get to this point. It's really a collaborative process and really working equally together umm… to come up with what those goals are for them. Umm… And to really be a support and encourager umm… to the work and to what they need to get out of their session. 

00:09:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. There's a lot of in what you just said you mentioned that you're focusing on… on wellness, (inaudible) diagnostic kind of piece as opposed to of your goal-focused encouragement that there's this rope kind of positive, kind of hopeful. 

00:09:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:09:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Kind of … kind of vision of what you just shared. 

00:09:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, it's definitely it's… definitely a growth mindset. It's a positive psychology, I mean that all of those kind of buzzwords now that we hear umm… really for me stemmed from Adler… from Adler. And so it's, you know, a more contemporary setting. It's like everywhere. I think people… don't believe that there are Adlerian but they really are. If you're positive, you're Adler. 

00:10:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

00:10:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So for me it… it is and it's a way that I like to live, I like to be positive. I like to find the good in folks. And so it's not necessarily go you're depressed, okay. You know, you have all these symptoms. Yes, we all can be depressed but it's What do we want to get out of that, how do we want to change, how to we want to live our life. 

00:10:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:10:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so it is that sense of hope and to give people hope because I don't think that's around as much. I don't think people just walk around it will fall (inaudible) and so it's really to help kind of growth (inaudible) for individuals. 

00:10:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. And then how do you tailor adapted learn model to work with a… wide range of clients and they're intersecting identities. 

00:11:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah well, like I said I was a school counselor and the other was, I mean, Adlerian counseling was great. I mean it umm… is brief umm… because I also have that flexibility to bring in other modalities and interventions that helps me to tailor it to a wide range of individuals, young and old. Umm… It also is a… a theory that in a practice that… race and ethnicity and other things are able to be considered. 

00:11:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So I can be cultural with it. I grew up in Hawaii and we have a lot of cultures… 

00:11:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:11:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON That influence how we work with individuals and because of that flexibility about Adlerian I'm able to consider those things. 

00:11:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:11:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So an example would be if I have a student who umm… is talking about Gods, Hawaiian Gods and, you know, saying that this Hawaiian God is, you know possessing their worried, or bothering them. That's okay to call that into the session. 

00:12:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:12:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know and so there's a flexibility to umm… not just be so therapeutic… like in a clinical setting but to have some flexibility. 

00:12:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, it sounds like there's an element around contexts that comes out of Adlerian kind of theory and thought even from the beginning in terms of its origins the context matters. 

00:12:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, yes. And I think that really frames it. So really in the beginning when I'm starting a session with someone, I really want to get to know them. I wanna understand who they are, where they grew up, family influences, background influences and so then that creates the context. 

00:12:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:12:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I think as a result that makes me so more multicultural competence. Because I… I… it's more than just what brought you in here today. 

00:12:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:12:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's because I'm taking the time. I'm putting kind of the issue on the side and really getting to know who's sitting across from me. I get… 

00:13:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Who came in today. 

00:13:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. Exactly. That… and… and to me that even that question you know, what brought you in today, it's really from a diagnosis… from a deficit. Rather than who's sitting across from me, who's sitting here and what you know what are they talking about today. 

00:13:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON That… I think about that. It's… it's (inaudible) say Adlerian's kind of , her less interested in what… what brought you in, more about where do you want to go. 

00:13:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, exactly. And kind of what's holding you back from doing that. You know, so when I think about Adlerian, there's a lot of the umm… misbelieves and that someone brings in and they kind of have the self-doubt. 

00:13:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:13:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Or self-defeating behavior and it's those roadblocks and if we don't kind of bring those to attention no one can move to where they want to go. 

00:13:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:13:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so my job is to really help people kind of uncover that. So that they can go about where they want to go in life and you know, where they're trying to travel. 

00:14:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right right. So I think it's sometimes that Adlerian role sometimes as you just being a time somewhat directive somewhat of a… of a teacher but also kind of walking alongside your client in some ways as they gain some awareness and the side terms what's happening. 

00:14:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Definitely. Definitely. It's that in a nutshell. 

00:14:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. And then this video is about the theory and action about techniques interventions. And I'm wondering a bit about how do you decide which techniques to use with… with what client. And how do you match and tailor them. 

00:14:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Well, I think first starting, umm… getting to know who my client is really helps give me a sense of where they're starting out. 

00:14:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:14:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… Once they, in kind of my first sessions, I get that full assessment of who they are. Then I go back and say, Okay from their goals, that kind of gives me the roadmap… 

00:14:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:14:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Of then what am I gonna try. So in that first session I'm really getting to know them, setting goals for our whole counseling session. And then in subsequent sessions, it's really looking at what are the roadblocks that are stopping them. 

00:15:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then when I find those roadblocks then it's using the techniques that would match or combat those roadblocks or umm… demonstrate that those are roadblocks. 

00:15:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:15:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so then based off of a client's awareness and my ability to really connect with them that kind of dictate the next set of… 

00:15:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:15:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Task. I really go through kind of phases where umm… we're working on the relationship. I'm doing an assessment. 

00:15:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then I go into where they're having their awareness. 

00:15:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then from there it's kind of a reorientation, re-education and goal setting and task to continue that on. 

00:15:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So it's just kind of stages of counseling that kind of go through and I've… and I guess I hear again saying that you're an active participant, here it's an active therapy. 

00:15:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:15:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON And you're gonna work with the clients that kinda… kind of create change. 

00:15:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, definitely. And the change they want. Not the change that I think they need. 

00:16:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Is there an ideal client for Adlerian in contrast, is their a client who maybe is not good for Adlerian work? 

00:16:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, I think for most umm… for most clients if it's definitely something that Adlerian is a brief intervention. 

00:16:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So it's not necessarily something that's gonna be real long long-term. 

00:16:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:16:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I would also say you know. I've done it as young as a kindergartner. 

00:16:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… To someone who's very senior. Let's just say it. So age range, no, male female, that it works but I would say if the issues are a kind of more long-term or pervasive. Umm… Then Adlerian I don't think would be the right choice. 

00:16:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON In my opinion. I think there's other modalities that really kind of get into kind of more clinical umm… whats the word, I'm trying to find, like clinical process or procedure. 

00:17:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:17:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …That would treat more kind of higher… higher risk issues. 

00:17:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:17:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But someone that's comfortable with kind of going back into their past, looking at childhood, umm… looking at kind of how they are… how their personality has set. 

00:17:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:17:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Would be fine but for someone who's maybe experienced a lot of trauma early in their childhood, it might not be… 

00:17:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Not good (inaudible). 

00:17:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:17:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. So if counseling is effective from Adlerian perspective what do you expect to see towards the end? What happens? 

00:17:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… A self-confidence happens. 

00:17:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:17:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… of person really feels hopeful. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And eager to try to be better. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Or feels that they have this sense of wellness. 

00:18:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so that's really what I should be seeing. 

00:18:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And… and not that the client is seen it. Not that I'm saying, "Oh, you look well", you know. 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …But really that the client is embodying that sense of wellness. 

00:18:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So a client's gonna have more esteemed in a way to move forward and kind of feel that health and wellness component. 

00:18:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes. 

00:18:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, umm… you do this and you teach it. So when you teach this to students, what are the kinds of things about Adlerian that you want your students to understand? 

00:18:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I think the biggest for my students, I like to start out with really understanding who Adler is, who Alfred Adler is and kind of how he came up with a theory because they think knowing his story… 

00:18:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:18:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Really explains why the theory is what it is. 

00:18:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:18:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I think it's very parallel to how we approach our clients. 

00:19:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON In knowing their story to then know and understand everything beyond that. So knowing Adler was a young child and was sickly and was away from his family and really was seeking, being a part of the group or how birth order plays a… a factor that really I think connects to students. And they can understand kind of how his theory came about. 

00:19:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… So I like to start there so that they kind of hear the story. They get to see the full context and then understand why his theory is the way it is. And to me that models how then they would approach counseling is to really understand who their client is and then the context of their therapeutic approach. So it's a very kind of parallel process. 

00:19:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so there's a… that… that… that assessment and a story matters, right. All right. 

00:19:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah definitely and so they're really able, you know, to understand, you know, how this came about. 

00:20:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:20:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so then when they're sitting across from a client, they're hearing that story and understanding why they're having the roadblocks that they're having or the issues that they're having. And so I really teach from kind of the same perspective… 

00:20:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:20:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON In really modeling how to do an Adlerian approached by really connecting and understanding uh… who the person is, who the client is. 

00:20:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, I mean, to say that I'm thinking it sounds like you're saying… you're talking about lifestyle, like how do we get to really understand what a person's lifestyle is, orientation to their life. 

00:20:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. 

00:20:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Because that will be essentially the roadmap in terms of probably why they are the way that they are. 

00:20:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. Exactly. And that takes half the battle out of counseling. You know, if you can understand why your client is the way that they are, it's so much easier. 

00:20:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON And for the client too, right? They… they… 

00:20:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. 

00:20:50
Introduction to Client 

00:20:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Just a moment we're gonna see you demonstrate six interventions and techniques and your client is Ramon. Can you please tell me a bit about Ramon and what brings him in? 

00:21:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, Ramon is a Latin X, Male in his mid 20s. Umm… He's come into counseling because of some feelings of not feeling worthy umm… or good enough. 

00:21:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it stem from kind of things that have happened in this past. 

00:21:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:21:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so he's really questioning his ability to be able to uh… first apply to grad school, 

00:21:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But then even be successful in grad school and really wrestling and struggling kind of that decision and kind of taking that step forward. 

00:21:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it's really related to kind of early things that have happened to in his life. 

00:21:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, sounds good. 

00:21:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:21:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill number one, encouragement. 

00:21:55
Encouragement 

00:21:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So what do you mean by encouragement? 

00:21:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Encouragement is… is what it sounds like. You know, umm… it's really being the person in the client's corner. 

00:22:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:22:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …That is uplifting them. Umm… That is helping them to see their strengths. 

00:22:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:22:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's really understanding who they are and connecting to that. Umm… And I would say finally almost like being a cheerleader in the… in the (inaudible) camp. 

00:22:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:22:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… When they don't believe that, you know, they can't be. 

00:22:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, I think it's… you know, we would think that most kind of counselors are encouraging but encouragement is a true technique from Adlerian. 

00:22:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, yes. It's really the foundation of Adlerian. I… And I believe that Adler said that it is the most powerful part of the therapeutic process. Umm… It's really to look for the self-confidence umm… that a client can possess. Umm… And that self-confidence allows them to be able to make changes. 

00:23:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. So what is the kind of goal of intervention and it sounds like it's to bring the client up to help them make changes but I also realize you're really focused on this at the beginning of this… of this session. 

00:23:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah so I think a lot of times clients come in and there's a stigma associated with counseling. 

00:23:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:23:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it makes why people don't want to come to counseling. Umm… They feel that they're gonna be judged. 

00:23:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:23:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON They're feeling like someone's gonna tell them what's wrong with them. 

00:23:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:23:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And the Adlerian approach is kind of to kick that out of, you know, get that out of their head really quickly. 

00:23:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… So what… how I tried to approach it is really setting goals with my client. Umm… getting a little understanding of who they are but then also what our therapeutic process is gonna be like. 

00:23:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I also want to make sure that power playing field of me being the counselor is kind of neutralized and really putting the client actually more in the driver's seat of their own session. 

00:24:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… So that's kind of how I would start with it, umm… I also to kind of lead… level that playing field with my client, is allowed them to ask me any questions that they may have of me. 

00:24:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And so it's not necessarily the sit and get where I'm just constantly rapid fire with questions. 

00:24:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

00:24:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …That they know who I am and how this is all gonna work. 

00:24:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So this encouragement is really gagement and engaging the client and you together to build that relationship? 

00:24:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, definitely. And I think counselors also they… they need to use their micro skills. And so in this way it's really highlighting, you know, your listening skills, your authentic statements, things like that. As you're really looking for the good and the little nuggets that you're gonna hang on to use throughout the counseling session. 

00:24:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So you mention kind of micro skills and looking for a kind of the good and the positive. Is there anything else we should be looking for in this clip? 

00:24:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I think definitely umm… having a positive relationship really seen and how therapeutic rapport is developing and making sure that uh… myself and the client are kind of meshing. And really working towards the same goals, not just my goals but the client's goals. 

00:25:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, sounds good. 

00:25:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:25:15
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER ONE: 

00:25:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Ramon, thanks for coming in today. 

00:25:20
RAMON Of course, yeah. 

00:25:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I wanted to first start our sessions with getting to know a little bit about you and but first to talk about what it is we're gonna be doing here today. I think it's real important that we talk about our kind of structure in our relationship within this therapeutic setting. And then get to know who you are. Is that sound okay with you? 

00:25:45
RAMON Yeah, that sounds good. 

00:25:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so when you think of counseling and coming in to see me, what are kind of your preconceived notions or what are you expecting from this session? 

00:26:00
RAMON I'm glad you asked that because honestly I'm nervous about it. Umm… I think all I've always heard it's like therapists and counselors are gonna like psychoanalyze you or maybe judge you. So there was a little bit of nerves there yeah. But overall, I'm… I'm excited to. 

00:26:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. Well, I think anytime we come into a new session and meeting someone new that are always gonna be nerves. Umm… So rest assured because I'm nervous too. Umm… Part of counseling is really that we develop a relationship so that you trust me and I… I'm looked at not as an expert but really that I'm here to help you discover your sense of wellness. Umm… So I want you to kind of keep that in mind that I'm not gonna be this expert who's gonna tell you what's wrong with you. I'm really gonna be here to support you and to help you discover what you want to get out of this session. Is that sound okay with you? 

00:26:55
RAMON Yeah, it sounds good. And that actually in a lot of ways helps me feel a little better. 

00:26:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay good. 

00:26:55
RAMON Kind of felt myself going like woo… 

00:27:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And that… and that's really how it should be. Umm… So when you think about the issue before we get to that, what do you think are your goals? What would you like to get out of counseling? 

00:27:10
RAMON I think for me, my goals would be just to have more confidence in myself to really know like or be able to fully grasp my capabilities because I know I'm capable of a lot of things but I… I… I just don't always believe that, I think. So it's just really to have more confidence in myself. 

00:27:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so we'll set that as kind of the first goal is really to have that confidence and belief in yourself. Is there anything else that you wanna get out of it? 

00:27:40
RAMON I know it can be really hard on myself and sometimes not feel worthy of things and I just… I guess I would be… I would love to be able to again it goes back to that to believe that I'm worthy of certain things. 

00:27:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:27:50
RAMON Yeah. 

00:27:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. So I think those are two really good goals that we can work through and as things come up if you're like, "Oh, I think I'm good with that and I really would like to set a different goal." Then just let me know and then we'll… we'll adjust and make changes from there. Is that sound all right? 

00:28:10
RAMON That sounds great. 

00:28:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, great. So let's first start, I really like to get to know who my clients are so if you could tell me a little bit about yourself and then we'll go from there. 

00:28:20
RAMON Sure. So umm… let's see umm… I'm a Leo. Uh… So I like attention but seriously though, I currently work in HIV prevention. So umm… I do just kind of sexual health education. I do HIV testing and counseling. I graduated with my bachelor's degree uh… a few years ago in psychology. So umm… although people think like, "Oh, you're… you did psychology or psychoanalyzing me too." I… I feel like it's very different than what therapists do. Umm… I come from like (inaudible) Latino family. Very family oriented actually, very close, too close to my family sometimes. 

00:29:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:29:00
RAMON And yeah, just always been very kind and compassionate and I'm thinking, umm… part of why I'm here is also just because I would really love to pursue higher education and pursue graduate school and I find that uh… there's always that little voice kind of telling me that I'm not good enough for it. But I'm… I'm kind of (inaudible) animal. I don't know if that helps here. 

00:29:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It really sounds that you're connected to people and then you find that as something that's very important to you umm… and that you're wanting to take care of others and uh… help them through their journey. Is that sound about right? 

00:29:35
RAMON Yes, actually, it's very accurate. 

00:29:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, umm… I like to in… in my counseling sessions make sure that my clients feel that there is kind umm… of a shared relationships so this would be an opportunity for you to ask me any questions that you have about me as your counselor. 

00:29:55
RAMON Sure. 

00:29:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So do you have any questions for me? 

00:30:00
RAMON Guess, one of the things I'm wondering is umm… like how long does this process take. Is it like a few weeks, does it take like years. I know some people I've heard like therapy can last for years. And so I'm just kind of wondering how long it takes. 

00:30:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON No, my approach when I am… I… I am an Adlerian counselor and in my approach, it's definitely very brief. Umm… I think Adler back in the day was like no more than 20 sessions. If you're going past 20 sessions that's too long. So I really believe in it working to your sense of wellness, it's not to look at your deficits and be like, "Oh, something's always wrong." But if you're starting to feel better and you're feeling like you're achieving your goals then sessions will be done. Umm… So it's really geared towards what you want to get out of it not necessarily my agenda. Umm… And I think that Answers that question. 

00:30:55
RAMON It does, yeah. It's actually relieving. I don't know, I guess I envision being in therapy for a while. It's that actually kind of helps me. I don't know, I feel better I guess. Yeah, I feel better about it. 

00:31:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON (inaudible) Any other questions that you before we get started? 

00:31:10
RAMON So you mentioned that your Adlerian therapy. What is that? Or can you tell me a little more? 

00:31:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, so Adlerian counseling is really this umm… therapeutic approach where it focuses on a person's umm… well-being. Umm… It can be integrative so based off of what you're telling me. I may might incorporate some interventions umm… that really help to… help you have self-discovery of yourself umm… in no way am I sitting here diagnosing you and telling you what's wrong with you. Umm… It's really just gonna be umm… kind of like, I envision it as like I am let me see those miner hats with has a light on it? 

00:31:50
RAMON Yes, yes, yes. 

00:31:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So my… my position in… in Adlerian is that I'm like this miner cap where I just am the light and I shine light into areas of your life and you're gonna have your "aha" moments and you're gonna come up with your goals and you're gonna be the one who is gonna be like, "Yeah, that's what I'm… that's what I want." And so it's not necessarily that I'm telling you what to do but you're gonna discover those things. Okay? 

00:32:20
RAMON Yeah, thank you. I didn't know there was different kinds. That's cool. Thank you. 

00:32:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, no, you're not gonna be laid on the couch. I am not gonna have you doing all kinds of things all over the place. It's really just… We're gonna have a relationship and I'm gonna be here to support you. Umm… It's almost like I'm your biggest cheerleader. 

00:32:40
RAMON Yeah, I love that. I love that, actually, yes. 

00:32:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So that… that Leo side where you need the attention that's totally me and I'm gonna be leading you on. And so when there's times that you might feel like you are not worthy to use your words. I'm gonna be the one who's gonna be like, "No, let's… let's change that belief. Let's… let's look at another option." 

00:33:00
RAMON Okay. 

00:33:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So I think it kind of really fits in with your goals of what you're trying to get out of it is that I'm really here to be a support to you. Umm… And to not put you down and tell you what you're doing wrong but really to build you up and to encourage you to find whatever it is that you're wanting to find, okay? 

00:33:25
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER ONE: 

00:33:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So Erika, is it's a good example of encouragement? 

00:33:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I think it went pretty well. Umm… you know, getting to know Ramon. Umm… I think he was nervous coming in and I was able to umm… help kind of reduce that anxiety. 

00:33:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:33:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I think he got an understanding of what was gonna happen in… in the sessions and we set some really good goals. Umm… So I gave him some direction. Umm… In past when I've asked the question of do you have questions about me. Folks will ask me questions actually about me. And so but I think, you know, he was comfortable umm… and wanted to know more about process. Umm… So those things I… I thought was a… a good showing and good attempt to really kind of build this therapeutic alliance. 

00:34:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah I notice you really kind of reinforce its decision to be in counseling initially and that was a good thing. Then there's this switch in which you… you kind of brought it between the two of you and you kind of said, you know, ask, "Do you any questions for me?" You know and so you actually shared who you are too. You also talked about kind of who you are as counselor, that you practice Adlerian. Was that common? 

00:34:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, I tried to put things on the table. I want umm… my clients to really connect to me as a person as I'm connecting to them as a person. Umm… Yes, I have gone and how training and have degrees on the walls and things like that. But I'm still a person umm… and I'm not gonna be perfect. And I think that's kind of the beauty of either he has a statement, it's like be imperfect with being imperfect. 

00:35:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:35:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so really showing that I'm a real person. 

00:35:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:35:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And the… the person that's sitting across from me is really just having a therapeutic conversation. 

00:35:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. And it seemed like it worked in the sense that from the beginning to the end you could see Ramon definitely ended that with being really engaged, exciting… excited to be in therapy. 

00:35:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. And… and I hope that it conveyed that you know, you can be yourself as a counselor. 

00:35:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON We kind of laughed and giggled, you know, when we're in it. Umm… But I think that's part of it. It's been that authentic self and that's what someone's gonna connect to using either a approach is really that ability to be open with your clients and to not necessarily feel like you have to be an expert and know all the right answers. 

00:35:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:35:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But it's a collaborative process. 

00:35:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:35:55
SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:35:55
Early Recollections 

00:35:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill Number two, early recollections. What exactly is early recollections? And why is it important from Adlerian perspective? 

00:36:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Early recollections is a process where the counselor has the client umm… go back to our earliest memories once that kind of stand out for them. 

00:36:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:20
Early Recollections 

00:36:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And the reason it's important is Adler really felt that umm… a… a person's personality, their style of life really was cemented by age five or six. Umm… so you know, things that happen really were dictated early on for that person and so early recollections is really kind of tapping into that. Umm… It's looking for what a person draws strength from. 

00:36:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's looking for what might be roadblocks or misconceptions or umm… belief systems that might be problematic for them. And really bringing that awareness to the forefront so that they can then make change or understand where their problem, issue is coming from. 

00:37:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so it sounds like this is a bit of like an assessment technique that also potentially has some insight as well. 

00:37:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, definitely. So in this second kind of phase of counseling for Adler is really this lifestyle assessment. 

00:37:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And early reckoned that recollections as a technique that's used to really gather, you know, kind of a formative way… 

00:37:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Of where a person is coming from. 

00:37:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so understanding is that… that in those lifestyle assessments, that's a composite. So they might actually have like a birth order and maybe like a… like a lifestyle scale within this part, is the kind of the live part you have with a client. 

00:37:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, definitely. And, you know, based off of what the issue or what the client might be presenting, that's what you kind of choose. 

00:37:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And to then decide if I'm gonna look into your birth order is imparted in or if a lifestyle scale is imparted. In this part with Ramon, his feeling of unworthy-ness. I really wanted to kind of see if that rooted from somewhere and so that's where I used the early recollections technique. 

00:38:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay so what should we be paying attention to in this clip, we want to? 

00:38:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… Really, I would look at umm… the questions that I've used to try and get him to umm… look at these early recollections. He gives three different examples. And… and if those examples have any connection. Umm… And any meaning and significance as it relates to the issue that he presented. 

00:38:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so it's (inaudible) kind of look for like as he talks about them or there any kind of themes that emerge that are, okay that are consistent, so, good. 

00:38:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:38:55
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:38:55
Early Recollections 

00:39:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay Ramon, so umm… I want you to think about umm… a time in your life umm… kind of like your earliest memory. Umm… And tell me about that particular time and what it means to you. So in this exchange, I'd like you to describe what you're… what that memory was and then what you… what it means to you from there. 

00:39:30
RAMON So I think for me a memory that really sticks out or you said my earliest memory? 

00:39:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
RAMON Okay, so it probably has to be when I met my… my… my grandmother for the first time. My mom's grandma. Because she lived in Mexico at the time so I think I was four maybe. Maybe three, I don't remember but I remember like just being in someone's house. It was in Mexico. I had never… I think it was my first time gonna Mexico and there were telling me like this is your grandmother. And I remember just being really scared. And I was like, "I don't know her." And my dad was like, "No, this is your grandmother." And my mom's mom and I just remember being really afraid and not wanting to hug her or be around her. Not that that she was bad. I just was more cautious because I didn't know her. So that's probably my earliest recollection and just kind of I remember just being really hesitant. 

00:40:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON What about that experience really like, is so strong for you? 

00:40:30
RAMON I guess because, you know, she's my grandma and I was kind of in some ways like maybe scared of her, not wanting to meet her. Umm… And you said like, how is it… why is it strong for me. I think when I think about it, I've always been really cautious when I meet people to in general. Especially in certain other areas of my life. So umm… I don't know I just, I guess, I've always kind of had little defenses when I meet people and just kind of like to keep people at arm's length too. So… 

00:40:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:40:55
RAMON I don't know. 

00:41:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Before we started… before you started with this memory, umm… we were gonna have a memory that was most influential, not your earliest. Can you tell me about that one? 

00:41:15
RAMON My most influential memory? 

00:41:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
RAMON Yes. So it was placed second grade, I think. And umm… I think I remember a teacher he… he just really commented or praise me for like my vocabulary and like my… my schoolwork and I remember that was very like influence… I remember feeling good about myself like even… I think it was 7… 7 or 6 I don't remember. 

00:41:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And what about that experience stands out to you that it made it so influential for you? 

00:41:45
RAMON I think for me like maybe a little later on in life probably when I was like later middle… elementary to beginning a middle school, I was bullied a lot. And there was like a lot of just I received a lot of negative self talk from a lot of people. Umm… And I would sometimes always remember that teacher telling me uh… just kind of that, you know, that I was smart or that I… umm… just did really good in school, I had good vocabulary in it and a lot of ways helped me feel better sometimes when… when I felt really badly about myself. 

00:42:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay. So really, umm… it kind of was encourager for you. 

00:42:25
RAMON Yeah. 

00:42:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:42:25
RAMON In a lot of ways. 

00:42:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, so if you were to think about let's say one more memory that, umm… you with, that comes to mind, what comes to mind for you. 

00:42:35
RAMON Hmm… I think it's probably kindergarten and that's not… that's not like a nice memory, it's more of a bad one but umm… it was kinder or the first grade, I can't remember. But I remember that the teacher would always kind of make me feel bad about my handwriting. So she would always tell me that my handwriting was too sloppy. So I remember a lot of times she would not let me play recess and have me sit in a corner and just like practice my handwriting over and over and over until it wasn't enough for her, I guess. And I just always remember feeling so, like, upset and sad because I could see the other kids playing or umm… just kind of doing their own thing and I was just in class, like, practicing my handwriting. 

00:43:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:20
RAMON Yeah. 

00:43:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON What about that makes it stands out for you about that experience? 

00:43:25
RAMON I guess in a lot of ways I felt like I wasn't as good as the other kids, like, because of my handwriting that there was something wrong with me. Or that I just wasn't as good… yeah, as good as the other kids. 

00:43:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So from these three, from re meeting your grandmother and kind of keeping folks maybe a little at arm's length umm… to your teacher who's really encouraging and uh… helping you kind of persevere when folks would do negative talk to you and then a teacher who kind of that really put you down umm… about your handwriting. Do you see any common links to what's going on with you now and your current with your current issue or situation? 

00:44:10
RAMON Yeah, actually now that you know, you pointed out, yeah I do. I think especially umm… one of the things because I had mentioned that I… that I got my… that I got my bachelor's degree. I know that I can be very, sometimes perfectionistic. And if I feel like my work isn't good enough, I'm really hard on myself like really, really hard on myself. And in almost in a lot of ways I feel like I'm less than… less than like the other students were that, I'm not as good or good enough. Umm… And definitely I think with my grandma and the arm's length thing, I think that definitely is kind of in a lot of way symbolic of how I am with people as… as an adult. Yeah. 

00:44:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Now, what makes it symbolic? 

00:44:50
RAMON I think. Specifically more romantically I tend to keep my partners very at bay and I put up a lot of walls and I'm just very distrusting. And now that I think about it, I think part of that comes from mayb e not feeling good enough and not wanting them to find out that I'm not good enough. So I kind of just keep them away to keep them from that. 

00:45:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:45:10
RAMON Does that makes sense? 

00:45:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON No, it makes perfect sense. And it's… and it's almost like that teacher with your handwriting is really kind of set umm… some wheels in motion. And those bullies have set some wheels in motion that are still happening now into your adulthood, you know. So what happened to the voice of that one teacher who always encouraged you? Why is his voice not as strong as it was back in I think you said second grade? 

00:45:45
RAMON That's a good question. I don't know. Umm… I'm wondering part of it is just more than I've kind of feel like I've received a lot more negative voices. So I've there's just been so many more negative voices in my life that I think in some ways drowns out that teacher's voice. 

00:46:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Have there been any other kind of those teacher voices those encouragers that have been in since then? 

00:46:15
RAMON I think it was that one, that's really significant for me too. Umm… It was actually when I graduated high school. I grew up really poor. My family is really poor. So the first thing I did was, umm… I just got a job. I think I was working at a Jack in the Box. And umm… I had never really entertained the idea of gonna college. And… my English teacher he always praise me too and a lot of ways because of my vocabulary and he said my writing was good or my… my Britain. And umm… he randomly like, I think a year after or two, I graduated high school, he just like, happened to be driving through the drive-thru. And he's like, "Hey, what are you doing here?" And I was like, "Well, I'm working like what are you doing here?" You know and he's like, "So what college are you gonna?" And I was like, "Oh, I don't think I'm gonna go to college." And he was like, "What?" And he… he… he's… he said a curse word. And he's like, "What the f like you're gonna go to college?" And I was like, "No, I don't think it's for me." And he said, he literally just said, "I'm not leaving this drive-through and I'm gonna hold up your line until your promise me you're gonna go to college." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah whatever." You know and I told him yes because I was like, I need you to get out because I'm gonna get in trouble. So umm… but then I think, a year or two later as I really did start thinking of that, like the possibility of gonna college I would remember him and what he said. And that really meant a lot to me. And in a lot of ways it helped me see that. Maybe somebody did believe in me or maybe there was something right, that might tell me that I'd be successful. Or that I could do it. 

00:47:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, it really looks like when they're influential people in your life who really are they're encouraging you and cheering you on that they really set kind of like a little fire to you umm… to get out there and to do things. And we'll need to hold some of those thoughts umm… as we kind of go through our process. So that way, you can start to build more of those and find more of those. So that they can combat what's going on. How does that sound? 

00:48:15
RAMON It sounds good. I'd love that. I like those, yeah. 

00:48:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, great. 

00:48:25
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER TWO: 

00:48:25
Early Recollections 

00:48:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So is this a good example of using Early recollections? 

00:48:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I would say it was good. 

00:48:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I don't think anything's perfect. 

00:48:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Which is funny because Ramon, being with… dealing with perfectionism, I was having a parallel process there. But really umm… I think it was good in him seeing three different situations. 

00:48:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, right. 

00:48:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And how they do play roles in his life, you know, so from meeting his grandmother and keeping people at bay. 

00:49:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:49:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then with the teacher who was very encouraging and how that made him feel. 

00:49:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:49:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then the last with the bully or with the teacher with his handwriting. 

00:49:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

00:49:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And you know how that made him feel and I think those are umm… concepts that have played out in his life. 

00:49:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:49:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, where he… he's developed this sense of unworthy-ness and keeping people at bay. And that there haven't been enough voices encouraging him. 

00:49:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:49:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so, I think that really brought some awareness for him that these were things that happened really early on but he's kind of still connecting. 

00:49:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. I was interested there's the… the woman he was for which we felt kind of essentially scared and then there's one he was saddened with a teacher who was encouraging and then when he was six and which he felt bad about the handwriting and so like so two out of three or these ones in which he is disempowered, dis-encouraged which seems to fit part of his kind of current narrative or lifestyle, right? 

00:49:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes. 

00:49:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, there's the other kind of theme of, "You are good enough." 

00:50:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

00:50:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Seems like it relates the inner struggle is kind of having with himself or what? 

00:50:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah well, you know, two out of three. So we know scale's a little a tipped here. And so he's really finding that he's had more negative kind of thoughts and that they weren't just early recollections of all these happy times, you know. And so it's really and… and you know, when I asked him, you know it's like what was the impact for you know, 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:50:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Are the earliest, it was these very kind of negative thoughts. Umm… So that to me is really evident of kind of what has carried through in his life. And that only one of those thoughts the minority thought was this encouraging resiliency. 

00:50:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that you, I mean again my hunches you had some insight. But you asked him first. And asked him to make sense of the three initially and he talked about a kind of that negative bias and you had to bring up and you'd said, "Oh and by the way there's this other one, sandwiched in the middle." 

00:51:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah, yeah and that seems to be the pattern that, you know, he was carrying through. 

00:51:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So I think for him it… it really was this sense of awareness that, you know, things were played out, you know, they were continuing to play out and they with clients, I think that's the beauty of this is that it allows them to have that awareness without me telling them. 

00:51:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

00:51:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, so they're able to really see what's happened in their own life and there's less defensiveness. 

00:51:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:51:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know because I'm not telling, "Ooh, this is what happened to you as a child." But they're telling me what's happened to them. 

00:51:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. Yeah, that makes sense and again I think you can, you can almost see that again that encouragement and in a part that came at the end of that clip. 

00:51:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. It is, it's… it's definitely I think when… when clients find and then have their "aha" moment, 

00:51:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:51:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's almost empowering. 

00:51:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Because they now know where it's coming from and then can work from there. 

00:52:00
SKILL NUMBER THREE 

00:52:00
Spitting in the Soup 

00:52:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill number three, spitting in the soup. So what is spitting in the soup? And why is it important? 

00:52:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Spitting in this soup, is taking someone's kind of umm… comfortability umm… in the issue that they're having. 

00:52:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:52:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And kind of throwing why uh… contradictions into it so that they realize that that comfortability in whatever negative behavior or thought they were having isn't actually real. 

00:52:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:52:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so this realization that they are empowered and how have goals or that they can do whatever it is that they're not… that they're thinking they're not able to. 

00:52:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So it's looks like a metaphor. It sounds like that you're gonna take what is maybe palatable but maybe not healthy unnecessarily. And make it no longer palpable anymore. 

00:53:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. Exactly. And so like within the case of Ramon, he was very good about self-defeating behavior. 

00:53:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay 

00:53:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And believing kind of the negative thoughts of why he shouldn't go and apply to grad school umm… but I kept hearing all these positive thoughts and I wanted him to recognize that there were more positive thoughts and so it's kind of like okay you said this, this and this. 

00:53:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

00:53:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And why shouldn't you apply and for him to have that realization of while I was having these negative thoughts and you're right you know and so kind of changing his norm. 

00:53:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so it sounds like what we should be looking for in this clip is umm… in a way using this metaphor. Ramon kind of you know, with his soup kind of eating his… his belief that he is not good enough, it's not gonna do it, why should I do it, I'm not gonna be a good student. And you kind of putting in some contrary notions which says, "Well, you are good enough. You are a good student. History says you can do it." And seeing if that kind of changes… uh… you saw the ability maybe kind of sit with that negativity which is comfortable. 

00:54:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, yeah because the negative like this spitting part isn't meant to make someone feel uncomfortable or defensive. 

00:54:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

00:54:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's really to see kind of a juxtaposition… 

00:54:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Uh… Okay. 

00:54:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …To where they're… where they weren't comfortable doing this negative behavior. 

00:54:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

00:54:35
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

00:54:35
Spitting in the Soup 

00:54:40
RAMON Umm… So although, I really do umm… feel like I want to pursue grad school and I think that's something I'd really like. Umm… When I was kind of looking just through the programs, I'm still kind of undecided of what I wanna do and you know, that's part of kind of my hesitancy. I'm not sure if I want to do social work or if I wanted to maybe just continue psychology or something else. And some of them kind of have prerequisites that I don't know, you know, that I didn't do so there's kind of like well do I really want to do it and do I really have the time and the other part is sometimes I ask myself like umm… "Do I have what it takes to… to finish like a Master's degree?" umm… And I think it's in those times where I really just kind of talk to myself and I tell myself like, "I don't think you can." And I find that it just kind of in a lot of ways it's easier to just put off like either looking into programs further or even applying. So I mix in those voices, it gets pretty hard. 

00:55:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, what… what makes it so hard? 

00:55:40
RAMON Just kind of , I guess fear that I might really not be good enough. And that I might not like just have what it takes to… to get my master's degree. Yeah. 

00:55:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So if you were to tell say I was that admissions team. Umm… Why what would you tell me? What are the all the good things that you would be applying? You know, like tell me all your good stuff. 

00:56:10
RAMON Hmm, okay. Well, if I were to get into social work or maybe umm… I think uh… it would be maybe that you know I had a really good GPA in college. I think I graduated cum laude, I did like a lot extra curriculars. But I also have experience working with people like doing HIV testing and counseling. I work a lot with people and I help them kind of you know, see the risks and kind of help them protect themselves. So I kind of already work in the helping profession with people. Umm… So I think I kind of already have experience. I guess is what I'm trying to say, I have experience already a little bit. So that's kind of what I would tell them. It's just that I work really hard. 

00:56:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And what do you think they're looking for? 

00:56:55
RAMON It's a good question. I don't know. Uh… Probably everything I just said. 

00:57:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So you told me of a really good GPA that you graduated with honors. You're telling me that you have experienced already and with a population that's not easy to work with, right? 

00:57:20
RAMON It's not, yeah. 

00:57:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Uh… You've also told me that you're a good person. You're family oriented, you care about people, you care about animals, right? 

00:57:30
RAMON A lot, yeah. 

00:57:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So I have six things are ready and just this really short time and we haven't even gotten to the depth of who you are. You know, so what else, what else would be good that I need to know about. 

00:57:45
RAMON My Gosh! I don't want to brag about myself now. 

00:57:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Why not? 

00:57:50
RAMON I don't know. Let's see… 

00:57:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Isn't… isn't this time excuse to interrupt you but isn't this the time that you wanna brag? That you want this committee to really be like, "Wow, we want this guy." So give it to me. This is your opportunity. I'm giving you permission to brag. 

00:58:10
RAMON And you know, it's funny. As I'm thinking about things I also kind of feel like But what if, right? But what if even in spite of all these things, I still don't do well. Or I guess not as well as I would like yeah. 

00:58:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So what does that mean? Not as well as you like. 

00:58:30
RAMON I think I've always kind of set a really high standard of like kind of like what I expect of myself. And I anything more than most people expected me and I guess it's just really hard for me and it's really stressful because for my undergrad like just being so focused on just getting A's just like, even sometimes just like feeling like I need to be the top student in the class was just a lot of working is really stressful. So I think part of that is also like I just don't want to go there again. 

00:59:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So is that more on a personal level of that stress that you've put on yourself that you're worried about that? 

00:59:05
RAMON Yeah, that's part of a… 

00:59:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, does that mean you can't get into a program and do well? 

00:59:10
RAMON That's true. Let's move… Now you mentioned and I… it means no, it doesn't mean that yeah I probably could still get into a program. 

00:59:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:59:15
RAMON Yeah. 

00:59:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So we got that part we know you can get into a program, right? 

00:59:20
RAMON Hope… maybe. 

00:59:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Maybe? 

00:59:25
RAMON Well, I… I think. Given what I said, yes. I think I can, yes. 

00:59:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

00:59:30
RAMON You are good at this. Well, okay, so we know we can do that and I hear some other things some other concerns you have. And those seem more like outside of your academic and this application round of being able to kind of have like a work-life balance. Is that, am I hearing that correctly? 

00:59:50
RAMON Yeah, actually because I'm… I'm pretty poor. So this kind of the stress of like having to work and pay for school and then the pressures of school and then social life and then the added pressure that I put on myself it's just when I think about it, it just already feels really overwhelming and I feel that that might be… that might play into whether or not I succeed and at least to the level that I want to succeed in. 

01:00:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON What would stop you from, if we were to put like everything is all good. What would stop you from succeeding like say you've got a scholarship, you didn't have to work. School's paid-for. Would there be anything else that stops you from succeeding? 

01:00:30
RAMON Honestly probably not. Just myself maybe, you know. 

01:00:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so we've got to get you out of the way. 

01:00:40
RAMON It's always been my… my challenge, yeah. 

01:00:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And you keep talking and you keep saying this thing about being perfect. What's… what's that about? 

01:00:50
RAMON I think, when I think about it… it probably it for so long I didn't feel like that I could be or… growing up like with lot of bullying and felt very worthless. I mean I was just something that I just felt for a very long time so for me when I started college and I finally did decide to go, uh… I realize I was one of the good… one of the good things that I thought I was really good at school and academics. So I don't know I guess in some ways I feel like because that's like that was like the one good thing or it is the one good thing about me that it needs to be perfect to kind of make up for all the bad stuff. 

01:01:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But is the bad stuff who you are? 

01:01:35
RAMON Yeah, to some extent. 

01:01:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, how so? 

01:01:35
RAMON Umm… Well, I guess… I guess it really isn't bad, you know, because a lot of the bad stuff for me was, I was always just like bullied and teased for being too sensitive and being very kind and you know I just said it really fit in to how a man is supposed to be or the boy wasn't it was a boy and part of that was a lot of where I was made to feel less than. 

01:01:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

01:01:55
RAMON 'Cause I didn't kind of embody what a boy or man has is like. 

01:02:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Well, but it's really interesting because you told me that you're considering graduate school in a helping profession you know, in either social work or psychology or something. And I would think that the person who was a counselor or a therapist or social worker should be kind and should be carrying. And those seem like really good qualities that you would bring from your childhood into a therapeutic session. What do you think about that? 

01:02:35
RAMON I totally agree, yeah, yeah. 

01:02:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So those things that people teased you about were qualities that you already possess. And that would be really strengthening to whoever you're sitting across from when you're… when you decide to be a counselor or a therapist or a social worker. You know, so it almost those bullies actually highlighted some of the best qualities of going into the profession. 

01:03:05
RAMON I never really thought about it like that. But yeah, that makes sense, yeah. 

01:03:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. So I… you know. Let's… let's rewind and think about that. 

01:03:15
RAMON Sure. 

01:03:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You have a good GPA. You're already have experience. You're kind. You're caring. You told me that you care about people and want to help people. 

01:03:30
RAMON Yeah. 

01:03:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You love animals. 

01:03:30
RAMON I do. 

01:03:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. So what's the dilemma about going into grad school besides finances? 

01:03:40
RAMON I mean, when you put it that way I guess there really isn't a dilemma and I think that's… that's what I want to be… be able to like even like say this now, I'll really believe it and work on that. So as to not really keep me from because as you say there really doesn't sound like there's a dilemma. 

01:04:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Now, but the thing is, is you have to believe that there's not a dilemma. And so it's like, do you believe those things? 

01:04:05
RAMON I do. I do believe that I am all those things. And I do believe that those are things that will help me succeed. Yeah. 

01:04:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:04:20
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER THREE: 

01:04:20
Splitting in the Soup 

01:04:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So is this a good example spitting in… in one's soup? 

01:04:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Well I think it worked with Ramon. Umm… He very quickly was kind of saying some negative things. 

01:04:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:04:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And was like very content. 

01:04:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Keeps him safe. 

01:04:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, keeps him safe. Umm… And so then when I asked him the question it took a little work but asking him the question of, "Okay I'm the admissions committee tell me what's good?" You know, he first gave me two things. 

01:04:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

01:04:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it was like, "Okay, come on dude." You know, like you've got more so I had to kind of push him and in that push, you know, he didn't want to brag. 

01:05:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:05:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I think that's the exact words. He was like, "I don't want to brag about myself." 

01:05:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, he said it, yeah. 

01:05:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And, you know, that's where kind of that spitting in the soup metaphor comes in where it's like, "Okay well, I'm giving you permission I'm spitting in your soup and telling you it's time to brag." 

01:05:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, so it's changing his normal kind of comfortable behavior of not bragging… 

01:05:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:05:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then really kind of identifying all these positive things which then he rattled off… 

01:05:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:05:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then I was able to add kind of to his soup. Umm… And to his list of all the positives that he's doing. I'm and I think then he realized, you know, like there shouldn't be a reason I don't apply like I'm a good student and I'm good person and I have experience, so… 

01:05:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, so he made in… in some ways that again it may not be what he wants but he's very comfortable. Kind of just not applying, the months can pass, you can not apply. And he can kinda… in a way he's comfortable beating himself up a little bit. Kind of saying he's not good enough because he doesn't have to take any risk. 

01:06:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON He doesn't… he doesn't want to take any risk in everything that everyone has said about him gets to play out as true. 

01:06:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:06:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Because, that's the belief that he had in it. It's that mistaken belief. 

01:06:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:06:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so this really was umm… an intervention to be able or a technique to be able to really give him some insight into himself and to start to believe that he is good enough. 

01:06:25
SKILL NUMBER FOUR: 

01:06:25
Push Button Technique 

01:06:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill number four, the push button technique. So what is the push button technique? 

01:06:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON The push button technique is an actual kind of visualization. 

01:06:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… A technique that allows the client to be able to see what they're doing wrong. 

01:06:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then to actively take a step to kind of correct. So like in the case of Ramon of hearing that self-defeating behavior umm… and constantly you know, saying it, this was a way to kind of snap him out of it and be like, "Okay, I can do positive things", you know and… and to actually visualize himself doing the… what he wants to do in life. 

01:07:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so it sounds like it's helping you understand that maybe that he has some choice and he has some ability to kind of determine outcomes, right? 

01:07:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah, yeah. In… kind of the stereotypical way of doing on the push button you have someone actually walk through a step by step process. So almost like a mindfulness activity where they're visualizing themselves doing the negative behavior and then you would have them visualize themselves doing the positive. 

01:07:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:07:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, in this case with Ramon we didn't go that far it was more of telling me about it. 

01:08:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:08:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I chose to do that because he was already really open about what was going on with him that it was I wanted to make kind of more concrete examples for him. 

01:08:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:08:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Rather than just visualizing, I wanted him to actually feel it. 

01:08:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:08:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So just kind of… of him explaining it and then actually doing the technique at the Varian. 

01:08:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay so it sounds like in the clip coming up we should watch for that set up in terms of kind of letting him kind of unpack it, you encouraging him to kind of feel a little bit more and then towards the end it sounds like you begin to kind of apply that technique of those 2… 2 sides. 

01:08:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

01:08:45
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER FOUR: 

01:08:45
Push Button Technique 

01:08:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Ramon, through our time together umm… I've heard these kind of negative self-talk. Or other people seeing things to you, that's really kind of made you question umm… your abilities, your worth to use your words. And I wanna try and maybe give you a tool that you could umm… help yourself and maybe just to kind of keep some of those thoughts at bay. So that way, all those really positive qualities that you've talked about really get to kind of show, show through and help build some of your confidence and your belief in yourself. How does that sound for you? 

01:09:30
RAMON Sounds good. Getting my moneys worth. 

01:09:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON We're good. So let's first start by let's do a situation and I want you to tell me about a time that maybe one of those bullies or whomever kind of was putting some of that self-doubt into your situation. And then I'm gonna ask you some questions about that situation after you tell me a little bit about it. 

01:10:00
RAMON Sure, like a time when umm… just like (inaudible) was just mean to me or said me things, like as a kid or an adult. 

01:10:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Either whatever you feel is. 

01:10:10
RAMON I think umm… one time one thing that really sticks out I was in PE think it was either right before I went to high school and I… I dreaded PE, I didn't want to go. I hated it so much. Because that's kind of when they would be the worst. So I remember just minding my own business just being alone, I was alone a lot in middle school. And uh… just like this group of Black boys just went up to me and started teasing me. Just telling me like, "Why do you talk like a girl? Why do you sound like a girl?" And I remember just telling them like please leave me alone like leave me alone. And they were just kept, they wouldn't stop and they would tease me and tease me until one of them actually kicked me like when I wasn't looking and it's just a fight broke out. And I just really remember just thinking like… like is something wrong with me? Like, why do all these like… there must be something with me, right? Because all these boys just keep harassing me and… and teasing me so. I think that was kind of more one of the significant ones for me. Just when I really felt like I was an other, I wasn't as good or less than, you know. 

01:11:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And so when those things were happening to you, umm… a lot of times we have a choice in how we respond or how we interpret those situations. So you have these bullies and they're questioning you and how you sound and how you're talking, before it gets physical you… concentrate on that part. And what would be, you have your reaction, right? And your reaction was… 

01:11:45
RAMON I throw a punch. 

01:11:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Oh, you throw a punch? 

01:11:50
RAMON I had never gone into a fight in my life and I think at that point it was just enough is enough. 

01:11:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:11:55
RAMON A fight broke out. 

01:11:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so to fight them. Okay, but you also took something, you also took a belief from them. And what was that belief? 

01:12:05
RAMON That something was wrong with me or that I somehow wasn't good enough. 

01:12:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:12:05
RAMON That wasn't… that something was wrong about me, I guess. 

01:12:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So what would be a counter? Another possible choice you could have made… in that belief system? 

01:12:20
RAMON In that belief system? I guess when I think back and, you know, having something that's sometimes just pops into my head just like those experiences just kind of thinking about it wasn't really anything wrong with me, it was more wrong with them because they were the ones being, I was just minding my own business. I would just keep to myself and they would come to me. So in a lot of ways… in a lot of ways, they're… they're the ones with the problem, right? Because they were the ones just being cruel and mean to me. 

01:12:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:12:50
RAMON So I guess it really wasn't me. 

01:12:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And so what would your belief about yourself be? 

01:12:55
RAMON I guess there really isn't anything or there wasn't anything wrong with me and I was just me and they just couldn't handle that. 

01:13:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:13:05
RAMON Or for whatever reason, they had… they had a problem with me that really wasn't my fault or anything to do with me. 

01:13:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So you have these two choices. Believe what these boys are saying or believe yourself and knowing that there's nothing wrong with you, right? And so in situations so for instance, we talked about you wanting to apply to grad school. And some of those doubts, "I can't do it. I'm not worthy. What if I'm not good enough? What if? What if? What if?" And then we have another possibility of, "No, I'm good enough. I can do this." So in this, when you're applying to grad school you have kind of similar competing beliefs. You have where you're doubting your abilities. "I'm not good enough. I can't apply." And then you have this other side where you've told me all these great things, right? So when these two kind of creep up, which one do you think what… what could you do to kind of squash this negative one and promote this more positive one? 

01:14:20
RAMON I mean I think. You know, just thinking about it, just try to focus on like, the good ones like the ones that I know because in spite of it, I do know I have a lot of good qualities and I think sometimes I tend to forget that. And I think just try to in some ways maybe remember remind myself it's a good ones. This hand, all right. Just kind of focus on that. 

01:14:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. What would be the thing that prompts you to think about that? Because I think sometimes in life and I'm just being real is that we can self… kind of self wallow in doubt and continue to think about those negative thoughts. What can help you to kind of do the opposite and really focus on your positive thoughts? 

01:15:05
RAMON I think as I think about it I think. Just really… like reminding myself of my achievements so far. I mean I did grow up really, really poor when my family did. And in spite of it, I was able to like, go to community college and I did terribly. But that was for different reasons. I was just partying a lot. But once I really got focused in school, I just Excel then I transferred out. And I did really well in school and I do really well at work. So, umm… kind of remembering that I've achieved a lot not only for myself but also for like, umm… the community that I serve. 

01:15:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes, it's almost like having a mantra? 

01:15:40
RAMON Yeah, just… 

01:15:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know and… and when there's that little that feeling that little doubt that starts to kind of bubble right, it kinda… does kind of start in the pit and grow… 

01:15:50
RAMON It and then it goes up here and then that's when I'm like my worst enemy. 

01:15:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And still, I think we have to kind of pay attention and be mindful you know, of when it starts to form and instead of letting it get to there that… that other, those other positive thoughts kick in. And they kind of keep it suppressed where it's just this little… it's there. And you're… we're always gonna have a little bit of fear, a little bit of doubt but that this other thought overpowers it. Keeps it down and it makes that other thought when you think about it, does it feel good? 

01:16:25
RAMON The good ones? 

01:16:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

01:16:30
RAMON Oh, yeah. Yeah, they do. 

01:16:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah and so it's remembering that feeling that it actually feels good and that keeps it at bay. How… how do you think that would work for you? 

01:16:45
RAMON I think once I start like maybe thinking or feeling that little feeling umm… I think I could just maybe like, just, like, maybe tell myself stop or I guess maybe just yeah telling myself or maybe learned to recognize it and then just thinking about all the stuff that I've achieved so far. Yeah, 'cause I know that tends to sometimes take the back burner for me. But just try to think about that and maybe focus on that are fixate on that. 

01:17:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. And I think you're the thought processes really good. I want to give you a metaphoric technique. Okay, so you kind of have two buttons and think about like you have two buttons on your… on your lap. 

01:17:20
RAMON Okay. 

01:17:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON One is all those negative, self-defeating thoughts. And you know, we can top that one pretty easily and those thoughts come up and they kind of prevent you from wanting to go to apply for grad school or go to grad school. On the other side, on your, are you right-handed or left-handed? 

01:17:40
RAMON I'm right. 

01:17:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, good. So on your right-hand side, that's gonna be your positive thoughts. 

01:17:45
RAMON Okay. 

01:17:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And those are gonna be the thoughts that are gonna tell you, "I'm good enough. I'm a great person. I'm a great…" you know, all these things. And so the great part of this technique is that you can there's like an actual lake visual and feeling and sensory of like, "No, I'm good enough." And so if you want to try it with me just like all the good things that you bring. Umm… Then those are gonna be kind of a reminder to you to stop you from these negative thoughts. That makes sense. 

01:18:20
RAMON Yeah. 

01:18:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So if you could try it right now and as you're saying kind of like good positive thoughts, like kind of tapping. Umm… And it'll help to kind of remind you and believe that you are all the great things that you can do. So if you'll give it a whirl. 

01:18:35
RAMON So let's see, I've always worked really hard. I'm kind. I'm good with people. Umm… I've always (inaudible) in the beginning but I've done well in school pretty… pretty good actually. And I already have a lot of experience working helping people in the community. And I… it's… I know it's something I really want so, I feel that if I really try to, I probably could do it, yeah so. 

01:19:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. I don't know if you notice but it was just something I noticed when you had that that one thought that was negative and you were gonna say, "Well, I wasn't always good." Your actual left hand. 

01:19:15
RAMON Really? I didn't notice that. 

01:19:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Actually lifted up. And hat other one slapped (inaudible) I'm good enough. And it never, never touch right down. So you have to, you know, it's kind of this good metaphoric reminder of that… that thought process that, "I am really… that I'm good enough." You know and it's like even if this hand wants to, the other one is kind of like defeating it. It's making it go away. 

01:19:35
RAMON I didn't even notice that. That's cool, that's really cool. Thank you, yeah. 

01:19:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so some things for you to try. 

01:19:40
RAMON Okay, thank you. 

01:19:45
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER FOUR: 

01:19:45
Push Button Technique 

01:19:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Is this is a good example of the push button technique? 

01:19:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I would say, it's an okay example. 

01:19:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:19:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I really think, uh… doing it kind of in its classic way is helpful for someone to be really mindful umm… of what they're doing and how they're feeling and acting. Umm… I think it was kind of telling you though that when we got to the tapping of the legs that Ramon, have that one negative thought come in and he was getting ready to tap it on his left leg unconsciously and but that other one kind of snapped it out. And it's like the light bulb went on when I… because he didn't even notice that happened. 

01:20:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

01:20:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so then when I said like, "Oh, did you notice? It was like the light bulb went on", you know, that like oh, you know, to make this connection… 

01:20:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

01:20:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …Was powerful for him. 

01:20:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, I thought that was really interesting as you kind of move towards in and had it set up that, you know, he could hit the positive and then with that one that was kind of mix. There's kind of like (inaudible) and then you caught it. You know, in kind of, really kind of said hey I noticed this. And he really that seem very insightful for him. 

01:21:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. And I think that's kind of the beauty of it is that he can make the change so it was like he was gonna have this negative thought but because we were focusing on positives, it countered it. You know, so he actually didn't even get it all the way down to his left leg. It kind of just swiped out. 

01:21:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:21:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Until that I thought was really insightful and for him to be like, "Wow I do have control. I do have power over my thoughts." And so that I think was a really impactful moment for him. 

01:21:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah and I noticed that the (inaudible) like how you ask if he's right handed. My hunch is because you know, his right hand, his strongest hand should be a strength. I really liked the way you did that. 

01:21:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah. I at first, I was like I was tapping because I'm right handed. And so my positive was this and then I had to catch myself. So I'm glad that I caught myself and to be able to catch it, to make sure that it was his dominant hand. 

01:22:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So what would Ramon takeaway from this? Would you… would you encourage and then to kind of use this in his daily life as well? He began to kind of maybe experience maybe some distress or kind of realize that he has control over situations depending on which way he decides to push? 

01:22:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes definitely. And then also paying attention to the feeling 'cause we… we talked about how it starts to build. 

01:22:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

01:22:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so it's really this practice of being mindful that this feeling is building and before it gets out of control, 

01:22:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, 

01:22:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON …To then use the technique in order to combat that. 

01:22:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Got it. 

01:22:35
SKILL NUMBER FIVE: 

01:22:35
Acting "As If" 

01:22:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill number five, acting as if. What do you mean by "acting as if"? 

01:22:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Acting as if is an Adlerian umm… kind of metaphor. 

01:22:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:22:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… To act as if you're all ready that person that you're wanting to be, that you're already whatever that well… feel, well feeling person is or whatever goal is achieved. And it's really to kind of… I almost think of it as like gonna try on clothes, like you're trying to see how it fits. 

01:23:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:23:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And when it fits and it fits good, we tend to start doing that more often. 

01:23:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:23:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so and we're putting it out there in the universe that this is what I want and this is what it feels like. And so it's really kind of that trying on… trying on that role getting comfortable with it because I think a lot of times will tell clients, "Oh go, do this." And they've never practice that. They don't know what it feels like, they don't know how to accept the goodness that will come from whatever choice they make. And so this really is kind of like a trial run before they get out into the world. 

01:23:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, so sounds like something that you would kind of maybe try in session within you prescribe for a client to go out in the weekend for a period of time act as if a certain thing, act as if you're successful. If you're smart enough, if you're a good classical candidate. 

01:24:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. 

01:24:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:24:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. 

01:24:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so that's what with… with Ramon. You know, he came into the session like, I… you know, I didn't apply. I didn't do these things. 

01:24:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

01:24:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And it came in very down. 

01:24:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:24:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so for me, you know, acting as if is like what does that feel like, you know, how do you… how do you embody that? What is that to build up that confidence? What does that look like? And so he really was able to then kind of embody that. And you know, kind of like a twinkle it as I… of you know, how I… how am I gonna be successful? How am I gonna get over this? 

01:24:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So it sounds like we should be looking for in this clip is at the beginning of the clip, Ramon in a way acting as if he is not good enough and acting as if he's a failure or not a good candidate. And then as the clip goes on, see how they're acting as if he's successful and seeing how you can just notice the change in his posture and his effect and everything. 

01:25:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, I would say though he came in already acting as if… 

01:25:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:25:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know. 

01:25:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:25:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so that part we won't see as much in this video. 

01:25:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON It's already there. 

01:25:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON It's already there. He's already bringing that in. And so it's really to combat that, you know and so to be in the positive side. 

01:25:15
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER FIVE: 

01:25:15
Acting As If 

01:25:20
RAMON So I kind of feel a little bad just because I… I know we talked about maybe beginning for me to try to apply or just the process and I… I didn't. And I'm kind of… I guess I beat myself up for not doing that. So I was just kind of… I've been feeling a little bad lately about that. 

01:25:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, well first off, don't feel bad. Okay, I mean, there's… this is a no judgment zone, okay. And so things happen but let's I… from our last conversation, I want to make sure that we're still on the same page. You want to do this. Okay, so how about we try something umm… let's imagine or let's see what would be like for you to act as if you are good enough. And then you are gonna apply. What would that look like? 

01:26:10
RAMON I think if I… well if I was gonna, I probably look into the pre-reqs that I need to get into the program scholar whichever one I choose. And then maybe talk to my friend. she's… she's applying and I think she… I think she may have gone in to an MPH program. So maybe talk to her to see like if she can give me any tips or any, you know, help with the process and then umm… yeah, see if I can get my pre-reqs done so that I can apply on time. 

01:26:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:26:45
RAMON I think that's kind of how. 

01:26:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so let's take it a little step further. 

01:26:45
RAMON Sure. 

01:26:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON What would that look like once you've already applied? 

01:26:55
RAMON Probably me dying of like, worry. I may not dying but just me being really worried but I'm also, guess feeling at least accomplished in a way that I… (inaudible) that I was able to apply. 

01:27:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:27:05
RAMON And then let whatever be… be. 

01:27:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:27:05
RAMON Yeah. 

01:27:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay so I'm gonna push you a little bit more. 

01:27:10
RAMON Sure. 

01:27:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, let's imagine you've applied. It is looking good. Okay? And you're not worried. What would that look like for you? 

01:27:25
RAMON It'd look amazing. Umm… I'd be… I'd look really, I guess happy. Umm… and in a lot of ways it'd be kind of you know, see, "You are good enough and you are worth it and you are able to get into grad school." And maybe not doubt that like, "I can do it and that I will succeed once I'm there or if I'm in there." 

01:27:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And what does that feel like right now saying that? 

01:27:45
RAMON It's really exciting, actually it feels. I'm trying to like, contain myself because yeah but… 

01:27:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Don't contain yourself. 

01:27:50
RAMON Okay. But it would feel really nice. It would feel nice not to tell myself because I know, other people have told me that, right? They've told me that I taught myself a lot. And that I don't know my own worth and my own capabilities. So just to be able to like really believe it would be amazing. And yeah, really, really exciting. 

01:28:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay so walk me through it, that amazingness. 

01:28:15
RAMON Let's see, I don't know, I guess I feel confident right. And I really if somebody were to say, "Oh so you apply to grad school?" I wanna be like, "yeah, but I don't think I'll get in." It'll be like, "Oh yeah, I did. And I'll probably get in." You know and even if I didn't just I'd be able to say, "Well maybe it just wasn't meant for me this time but I'll try again." Verses just being sad. So I guess, just really feeling confident and proud of myself for always trying. 

01:28:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON How does that feel for you right now saying like, "Oh, I got in. I applied. I'm confident." 

01:28:40
RAMON Oh my God, it feels like exciting, poly jubilant, it feels accomplished. 

01:28:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, feels like you got a little swag about you. No, because I mean, when you were saying it, you were. I mean, you were expressive, you kind of sat up a little bit. You got a little twinkle in your eye. You know, and it was very different than, "I didn't (inaudible), I'm not good enough. 

01:29:05
RAMON Yeah, it's true. 

01:29:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know and so that feeling we have to remember that. You have to be in that as if I was. You know and it's like putting it out there in the universe for it to happen. You know and that part but then it's also you believe in it and feeling it. And so that's the part we want to harness. So let's one more time, like what would that feel like? What would that look like for you? 

01:29:25
RAMON It'd look amazing. Umm… It would feel amazing because I… I was feeling pretty bad when I came in. And just kind of more like I disappointed you or even myself because I didn't apply or at least really look into it. But right now it actually feels good. I don't know, I always feel like a little bit of hope I guess and motivation. So I feel motivated too. Wow, yeah. 

01:29:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, all right so something to maybe work towards and you have to remember this is for you. You know, it's not for me. That's not about proving something to me. It's… remember when we first started this relationship it was really about you focusing on what's gonna be good for you and well for you. And your goal, right? Of you wanting to do this and so you really have to pay attention to that. You have to kind of do these things because it's gonna make you feel good and it's what you wanna do. And that's the part you have to remember from this. And in this kind of uh… metaphor is really to… walk around knowing and feeling that… that feeling of accomplishment because that's what you're striving for. 

01:30:35
RAMON Yeah. And, you know, I think as you said that I… I kind of realize a little bit that maybe I do things to prove to other people that I'm good enough and that I'm worthy. That I need to do it for myself. Thank you. 

01:30:50
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER FIVE: 

01:30:50
Acting "As If" 

01:30:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So is that a good example of acting as if? 

01:30:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I think it was good. Umm… I think Ramon really umm… it took a little bit of work. 

01:31:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, he fought… fought you a little bit. 

01:31:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON He fought me. But you know, I'm persistent. And I'm gonna keep asking my question and keep tweaking it. 

01:31:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

01:31:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I think you're always gonna, you're gonna have clients that are gonna resist. You know, its something new for them. And so for Ramon, he's been so comfortable and in being defeated. 

01:31:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:31:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Or not trying. 

01:31:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:31:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Or trying to please other people. You know, it was very… it was interesting when he told me, you know, I would… I didn't want to disappoint you. I have no speak in this game. You know and so it's just like, you know. 

01:31:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:31:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So really to kind of encourage him to be comfortable, umm… really incorporating umm… what it would feel like. 

01:31:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:31:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… Wanting to embody a it, this new Ramon. 

01:31:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:31:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so I think that part was enlightening for him and also empowering. It made him want to kind of get out there and do it and feel really confident. And I think that was a different Ramon than who started the session. 

01:32:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah I… I noticed that you know, in ways in which these different techniques kind of link up. I mean, can you use your relationship with them that's already kind of there, use encouragement to kind of get them to try something different which is to pretend that certain beliefs are different, right? And eventually he kind of gave… gave it a shot in that moment and he showed it to you. 

01:32:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah and he really trusted me. And I think the work that we had put in early on is this that's where it… it… it plays out. 

01:32:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:32:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So that in the beginning when I am trying to build that therapeutic alliance and have him trust me and see me as a real person, 

01:32:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:32:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON This is where it's like when the going gets tough, 

01:32:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:32:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, this is where it really counts. And so that was the… the benefit of really kind of encouraging him in the beginning. 

01:33:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah and it's interesting, the way this technique works. It looks like as just reinforcing that the body moves where the mind takes it. Right and giving him a chance to go out and try something different. 

01:33:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah, in a safe place. 

01:33:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON In a safe place. 

01:33:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Where, you know, he's trusting me, you know, he's… he is knowing that I've… I've got his best interests. 

01:33:20
ADLERIAN THERAPY 

01:33:20
SKILL NUMBER SIX: 

01:33:20
Task Setting 

01:33:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Skill number six, tasks setting. So Erika, what is task setting from Adlerian perspective? 

01:33:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Task setting is really umm… the goal setting part of it. 

01:33:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… it's when the… the counselor gives the client homework. 

01:33:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And gets them out there to start trying their new behavior, their new umm… strategy. 

01:33:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… And to really put it in action. 

01:33:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. Is there a sequence on when you would use this in a course of therapy? Or is this kind of thing you use ongoing or… 

01:33:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… I would say that I… I definitely wouldn't use it in the first session. 

01:34:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I would say once I really have understand the client and the issue and seeing if the client is kind of a self-starter or not. 

01:34:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Then I would use task setting after that, to kind of set that goal. I also like using it kind of as a closing too. 

01:34:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… So if I'm getting towards the end of sessions with clients. Helping them to kind of set goals for their own future. 

01:34:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And how they can umm… really kind of… embody the work long-term rather than just when we're in counseling. 

01:34:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay so it's helping the client take something out of that session or the counseling and to do certain tasks over the week or the time between the next session. That sounds like to be clear of what the expectations are. 

01:34:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Exactly. And it's really to hit those goals that the client has. 

01:35:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON That are client's goals. Okay, okay. Good. Umm… So what should we be looking for in this clip with… with Ramon? 

01:35:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… Well really looking at umm… holding Ramon accountable. 

01:35:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Because his default is kind of be wishy washy and elusive, 

01:35:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Umm… to really kind of taking those steps of applying to grad school. 

01:35:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON This was a kind of a time to kind of pin him down and be like, "Okay, now you're gonna have some homework here. And here's some specific tasks to help you to get to that goal that you're wanting." Because on one end, he's really wanting this goal. 

01:35:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. 

01:35:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And I check in with him on that is like, "Is this something that you really want?" 

01:35:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And then to be like, "Yeah, this is what I want. Okay so now here's the steps I need to take in order to get there." 

01:35:45
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON So we should look for the way in which you kind of narrow that goal down the check and that's something that he… he truly wants to do. And that's something that is tangible so to speak. 

01:35:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah. 

01:35:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:36:00
EXAMPLE OF SKILL NUMBER SIX 

01:36:00
Task Setting 

01:36:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, Ramon. So we've, hopefully in this time umm… now have you feeling good about applying to school. Umm… Let's set some kind of, I'm gonna give you a little bit of homework. 

01:36:20
RAMON Okay. All righty! 

01:36:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON we're… we're testing you. we're testing you. We are getting you ready for grad school. Okay. And so, just a little bit of homework. Should be easy shouldn't be anything too difficult. But if you were to think about the steps that a task that you need to do. You already kind of started, you know, talking with your friend, looking at the prerequisites. But what else would you need to do to get yourself to actually applying to grad school? 

01:36:55
RAMON Umm… I think the first steps for me right now umm… would be just to apply to… I want to do my pre-reqs at a community college. so I don't pay as much. So probably apply to any community college around me that has or offers a pre-reqs that I need. Umm… And then once I get in umm… or… or I will get in. I will get into community college. I will get it, yes. Umm… And then just make sure that I'm… that I'm just kind of getting everything ready or the requirements for umm… the grad program that I'm gonna apply to. 

01:37:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:37:25
RAMON Yeah. 

01:37:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, now when we talked last time, umm… you came back in this week where you were like, "I didn't do it." What was a roadblock that stopped you from not doing it? 

01:37:40
RAMON I think a big piece was just me telling myself that I might not have enough time umm… because like… because this is kind of late for me in the game, at least for application process. Just kind of telling myself that umm… I probably wouldn't have enough time to like do my personal statement to apply for my… to get my pre-reqs at a different community… at a community college. So I guess, just telling myself like, "Oh. you don't have enough time." 

01:38:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So how do we create and make sure that you have time in this next week to get that done. 

01:38:10
RAMON While I was talking to my friend, and she's doing her, her MPH or she's gonna do it. And she just kind of said she would help me, and just to call her and let her know and that we'll sit through like show, like be there, 'cause she kind of knows how I am. So she said like, if I call her, she will, like come get me, and we'll, we'll work on the application stuff together. So just maybe giving her a call and see what time she has, so we can kind of do it together. 

01:38:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay so I'm gonna hold you accountable little bit. 

01:38:40
RAMON Okay. 

01:38:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay? When do you think you're gonna call her? 

01:38:45
RAMON A good question. I could call it her today. 

01:38:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:38:50
RAMON Yeah. 

01:38:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay so you're gonna call her today and set up that time to meet with her, and then, is there anything else that I have to hold you accountable beyond that? 

01:39:00
RAMON Probably. 

01:39:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, what would that be? 

01:39:00
RAMON Just applying to a community college, so I can do the prerequisite that I need. 

01:39:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so when you meet with her, you may be working, you're gonna be looking at the application process, what about the personal statement that you mentioned. 

01:39:15
RAMON I could probably start a draft, and they are working on that. 

01:39:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:39:20
RAMON I kind of already, a little bit, kind of mapped out, maybe what I want to say in my personal statements, so just maybe trying to do a quick rough draft or just getting all my ideas on paper would actually really helped me, so… 

01:39:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay. So you're kind of being a little wishy-washy. And you're getting me a lot of probably isn't a kind of some, I'm tryna hold you accountable here. So what would be, When you would. When would you be doing that? 

01:39:45
RAMON So my day off is tomorrow so I could, I could work on that tomorrow. 

01:39:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:39:50
RAMON I will work on that tomorrow. 

01:39:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so tonight after you leave, you're gonna… 

01:39:55
RAMON I'm calling my friends. 

01:39:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, and then tomorrow on your day off… 

01:40:00
RAMON I'mma start kind of putting my ideas on paper for kind of what I wanted to say in my personal statement, just organize a little bit. 

01:40:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay. And then from there, looking into the community college, and looking at the prerequisite. Do you feel like that's an immediate or do you think you have some time on that? 

01:40:20
RAMON I think because spring semester is gonna be starting soon for, for those I should probably get a little quicker on that. 

01:40:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:40:30
RAMON So this week, I think if I have time tomorrow, I think I could definitely not only maybe write some stuff for my personal statement or at least organize my ideas, but start applying for community college. 

01:40:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay. Does that all seem doable? 

01:40:45
RAMON Yes. 

01:40:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And not adding to your stress level? 

01:40:45
RAMON No. I think that's what I need. I think I've always needed somebody to like push me. 

01:40:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, okay. 

01:40:50
RAMON Yeah. 

01:40:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay, so the next time that you come in, we'll check in, we'll see how that worked. 

01:41:00
RAMON Sure. 

01:41:00
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And hopefully, you've started your process, and then we'll go from there. 

01:41:05
RAMON Sure. 

01:41:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Okay. 

01:41:10
DEBRIEFING OF SKILL NUMBER SIX:Task Setting 

01:41:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Erica, is this a good example of task setting? 

01:41:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I think it went really well. It was funny because when I said a homework, Ramon's like, "Oh gosh, it's starting already. I admit…" It was like, "Wait a minute, no, we want to go to grad school. There's gonna be homework, so we're gonna start to practice. 

01:41:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right, right. 

01:41:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON But that part was great and really helping him to kind of set steps. 

01:41:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:41:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON When I first asked him what are you gonna do? He was like, "I'm gonna talk to my friend." And it was kind of these, very like thrown out there right answers. 

01:41:50
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. Not must commitment to it. 

01:41:50
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Not at, not at all. And it was like, oh 'cause my friends did it, they'll be supportive. And (inaudible), you know, the part I was proud of was really that I was holding him accountable, and that we came up with actual steps for him to do. 

01:42:05
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:42:05
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I also assessed if he was, you know, kind of like, "Can he do this?" 

01:42:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Sure. 

01:42:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Was it gonna add to stress level, you know, and things like that to allow him to be able to see these task as not being overwhelming. 

01:42:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Sure, yeah. 

01:42:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And to be doable. 

01:42:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. Would you… When you think about, about this, what would you do in the next session? Would you kind of follow up and ask him if, you know, "Did you do everything you said you were gonna do or…" 

01:42:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, definitely. I think it's a great starting point for counselors to kind of check in and summarize what has happened between sessions. 

01:42:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Yeah. 

01:42:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON So it kind of would be a good starter for a counselor to be like, "Hey, so let's check in on those three tasks that you were assigned. Did you achieve them? Did you not achieve them? Why or why not?" And then that, based on those answers, it's gonna kind of dictate how that second session, what we need to work on. So for instance, if he started his essay, checked in with his friend, but didn't go and apply to community college. 

01:43:10
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:43:10
ERIKA NASH CAMERON I'm gonna look for why that didn't happen. Was it just too much? 

01:43:15
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:15
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Then I know when I'm giving him homework, I need to have kind of smaller steps. 

01:43:20
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Okay, okay. 

01:43:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON If he did all of it, great. Do we need to do anything else? Is there any follow-up? So it kind of keeps him on track and helps them to learn this kind of new behavior. 

01:43:30
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:43:30
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And really look at strivin g for his goals. These are kind of the steps he needs to do to get there. 

01:43:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON And this is an example again we're (inaudible) is a bit action-oriented, right, and directive. 

01:43:40
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yes. 

01:43:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON That's not just in session, but you're gonna encourage other things happening outside. 

01:43:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, it really is because it helps someone to really feel empowered to be able to work towards where they wanna go. 

01:43:55
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:43:55
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And so by giving these little kind of bite-size homework pieces, it helps them to kind of build and be able to get there. 

01:44:00
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right, right. I think that, again, it's a good example again of how this all comes around. Again I… In that clip I saw that, that encouragement, I saw that relationship, the part of you that you knew him, that you're working on things that he wanted to do, so he has ownership. Again, it seems like based on that, again, he's making these choices on things that he feels like he can do. 

01:44:20
ERIKA NASH CAMERON Yeah, yeah, 'cause nothing in that session was me coming up with it. 

01:44:25
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:44:25
ERIKA NASH CAMERON You know, it was really putting the work back on the client, you know, and that I'm just along for the journey to provide some insight and question. 

01:44:35
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:44:35
ERIKA NASH CAMERON There was a point where I was like, "Okay, can you handle this or is there anything else you need to be doing?" 

01:44:40
MATT ENGLAR CARLSON Right. 

01:44:45
ERIKA NASH CAMERON And he was allowed to assess that. It wasn't that I'm like, "Okay, you only get to set two goals." You know, it was really checking in like, "Is there anything else that we need to consider?" Because if there's room to add one or subtract one, that's where we would kind of talk about it. 

01:45:00
