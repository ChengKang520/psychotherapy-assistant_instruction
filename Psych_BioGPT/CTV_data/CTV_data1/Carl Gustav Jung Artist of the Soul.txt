CARLO ALTOMARE Water, the perfect symbol of the unconscious was a central theme in the life of Carl Gustav Jung. Jung was born on the banks of Lake Constance. During the earlier years of his life he followed the course of a river that lead him downstream towards an academic career. In Basel Jung began to move against the current in his quest for the genuine source of life. On the banks of Lake Zurich in the last years of his life he searched the depth of his soul and had some groundbreaking insights about the nature of the human mind.

GEORGE MCGRATH The story of any life starts at a random moment with the detail that we just happen to remember. At this point the story is already very complex. We do not know what life will be like therefore the story does not have a beginning and we can only vaguely presume it's goal. Most memories of the external circumstances of my existence have faded or vanished, however, my encounters with the other reality, my struggles with the unconscious are indelibly impressed on my memory. By comparison, everything else has lost its importance. I can understand myself only in relation to interior events which have characterized my life. This is why I refer principally to these events. Dreams and fantasies are the raw material of my scientific activity. They have been, for me, the molten lava that generates through crystallization the stone that is to be sculpted. 

00:02:40

00:02:45
GEORGE MCGRATH My memories go back to the second or third year of my life. Fragmented, disconnected memories with no apparent link fluctuating in a sea of uncertainty. I suffered from indefinable nighttime anxiety. I could feel obscure presences. I was constantly aware of the deafening thunder of the Rhine falls, an area of peril where many people drowned. They're bodies carried away by the current. There was a large rock in our garden. It was my stone. I often went to sit there when I was alone. It was the beginning of a game of fantasy which went more or less like this: am I the one sitting on the stone or am I the stone on which he is sitting. I had no doubt that the stone had some obscure relationship to me and I would sit there for hours, fascinated by the enigma it presented. This stone has no uncertainties. It does not need to express itself. It is eternal and lives for millennia, I thought. While I am but a passing phenomenon that consumes itself through all kinds of emotions like a flame that burns and then dies out. I was merely the sum of my emotions and some other element in me was the timeless stone. I was constantly in search of mystery. I was immersed in nature. Almost blending into its essence away from the world of mankind. Today, as then, I am a loner because I know and I sense what others ignore or prefer to dismiss. My parents' marriage was a test of forbearance, tense with difficulties. Both made mistakes typical of many couples. My mother was an excellent parent but I am sure she had two personalities. One harmless and human, the other alarmingly primitive and ruthless. As ruthless as nature and truth. I too have this primitive nature in me. It is combined with the mostly unpleasant gift of being able to see people and things as they really are. At 14, during a holiday at the foot of the Rigi, my father gave me a train ticket saying, "you may go to the top on your own." I was speechless with joy. The locomotive started to climb to dizzying heights where abysses and the changing landscape rolled in front of my eyes until I reached the summit. And there, in that exceptionally fine air I contemplated unimaginable distances. Yes, this is my world, I thought. The true world, the secreted world where there are no teachers or schools and where one can be without the need for questions. It was awe inspiring and I felt a need to be respectful and silent because I was in the world of God. Here, his world was tangible.

00:07:00
CARLO ALTOMARE At 20, while he was studying medicine in Basel, Jung already felt uncomfortable with the beaten track. The weight of the city's tradition was, for him, an unbearable burden. Jung made his choice of profession after reading a psychiatry textbook by Krafft-Ebbing. At last he had found the field of experience that encompassed both biological and spiritual realities and probed the relationship between the mind and the body which was his main interest in life. From that moment on, true to his own star, Jung started to go against the stream and studied psychiatry, a subject that enjoyed little recognition at the time. 

00:07:50
[music] 

00:08:05
GEORGE MCGRATH My interests and my research were dominated by a serious problem; what really happens to the mentally ill. It was a subject that I could not comprehend and in which none of my colleagues took an interest. At that time Freud was extremely important for me, especially his groundbreaking psychological research in the field of hysteria and of dreams. Thanks to my work with patients I noticed that obsessive ideas and hallucinations have a meaningful core. They conceal a personality, the story of a life, of a person's fears, hopes and wishes. At first I agreed with Freud. According to whom the unconscious contains remnants of past experiences. My own experience with the unconscious led me to believe that these remnants are not dead patterns but belonged to our living psyche. I soon found out that it was best to start any case by taking dreams as they presented themselves. This is what dreams are for. Their reality is our starting point. The dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul. Which opens into that primeval cosmic night that was soul long there was a conscious ego. Consciousness alienates but in dreams we reach the profound universal man, true and eternal, still immersed in the darkness of that primeval night where he was everything and everything was in him, undifferentiated and without ego. Dreams are born from the depth that connects everything. Sometimes, by means of lengthy detours we must lead the individual to a dark area. A seemingly insignificant irrelevant and inessential area of the soul. To do this we must follow a path that has been abandoned for a long time, that is thought of as an illusion or even nonsense. This area is nothing but a fleeting ephemeral and grotesque product of the night; the dream and the path is the understanding of dreams. Engaging with dreams means becoming aware of one's self. The art of dream interpretation cannot be learned in books. He who does not know himself cannot know someone else. In each of us there is an other that we do not know, who talks to us through dreams and presents an image that is different than the one we hold of ourselves/ Because of my keen interest in dreams I felt compelled first to probe my own psyche; an endlessly torrent of fantasies was unleashed. I was helpless in the face of a strange world where everything appeared complicated and incomprehensible. If I had not translated emotions into images I might have been destroyed by the contents of the unconscious. In sustaining the assault of the unconscious I was helped by the certainty of obeying a superior will. And this feeling gave me the strength I needed to harness the situation. I wrote down these fantasies in a red book adding drawings. I took great care in trying to understand every image and to classify them rationally as far as possible and above all to relate them to my own life. All my writing and all my creative work has arisen from these first fantasies. Humans have a great responsibility towards the images of the unconscious. If we fail to understand them or avoid the moral responsibility we hold towards them, we deprive life of its wholeness and condemn ourselves to a painfully fragmented existence. I have worked on this book for 16 years. The superficial observer will think it absurd and it might have been if I hadn't been able to harness the overpowering strength of these primary experiences. My family and my profession have always been a joyful reality and an assurance that I was normal and sane.

00:13:40
GRET He was always absorbed in his red book. It was incredible how much attention he dedicated to the choice of colors to perfecting every detail. His capacity for concentration astonished me. I would have liked to find out more, to understand what he was doing, because I really hadn't a clue. Only when mother died did he read us a few excerpts from the red book. He hadn't noticed, but his dreams had announced to him, nine months ahead of time, that mother was about to die. I was 15 then, and I was very impressed by the amazing power of dreams; that such a thing could happen. 

00:14:25
AGATE Jung's daughter 

00:14:30
AGATE I accepted my father as he was, always engrossed in his work, except during holidays. 

00:14:40
GRET When, during lunch, I told him about a dream of mine, he stared at me silently over the top of his glasses. I did not dare go on; although I intuitively felt he was reflecting on my dream. He would have preferred to hear about that dream some other time. Yet I lacked the courage. I thought that if a dream was worth his attention, he would tell me. He did not like to discuss dreams with young people. He thought that, at their age, they should deal with other matters. 

00:15:15
AGATE He did not like talking about psychology all day long. When he was with us he preferred much simpler conversations. 

00:15:25
GRET People thought he was somewhat strange. I remember when I started high school, I was happy to make new friends, but their mothers organized a meeting to discuss whether it was appropriate for their daughters to get to know a girl like me, the daughter of a psychiatrist. At 12, I had a crush on a classmate. When we were seen together, someone told his elder brother, to prevent him from going out with the daughter of a nonconformist who was in close contact with the world of insanity. 

00:16:00
GEORGE MCGRATH In 1918 I was in Chateau d-Oex as a commanding officer of war internees. Every morning I used to draw a small circle, a mandala. I could thus, from one day to the next, observe changes in my psyche. I understood little of these drawings but they seemed very significant and I kept them as precious treasures. I saw in them the workings of the self which was my wholeness. I saw that all the paths I had followed consistently lead to one point, to the center. It was finally clear to me that the mandala is the center. It is the expression of all the past. It is the way to individuation. God is an infinite sphere, or circle, who's center is everywhere and circumference nowhere. Little attention is dedicated to the essence of man, to his psyche. I have often seen people become neurotic because they make do with inadequate or wrong responses to the problems of life. They seek status, marriage, reputation, external success or money and remain unhappy and neurotic, although they have obtained everything they were striving for. Such people are usually confined in too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life lacks content and meaning. If they succeed in acquiring a broader personality their neurosis usually disappears. Among the so called neurotics of our time many would not have been such at other times. They would not have been in conflict with themselves. If they had lived in an era or in an environment where man, through myths, was still connected to the ancient world and when nature was truly experienced and not merely observed from afar they might have avoided this division within themselves. Nowadays, everyone wants to hear about great political and economic programs; the very concepts that have lead nations to their present situation and here is a man who talks about dreams and an interior world. All this is ridiculous. What does he think he can achieve faced with a huge economic program or the so called problems of the real world. However, I do not speak to nations. I address only a few men. If great projects go wrong it is only because the individuals got it wrong, because I myself got it wrong. To be reasonable first man has to examine himself. Moreover, as no outer authority is able to give me any clues I need to know the intimate groups of my subjective being. It is all too clear that if the individual is not really renewed in his spirit society cannot renew itself as society is the sum of individuals. 

00:19:45

00:20:10
GRET We often went sailing, but not like other people do. He took us on the lake even in the middle of Winter when it was so cold nobody ventured outdoors. Those were our "North Pole journeys", as he called them. 

00:20:25
AGATE It was wonderful. When we set out in the morning the fog was still thick. Our eldest brother had to blow the horn every two minutes. At around ten o'clock, the sun dispersed the clouds, and a light, moderate breeze started blowing. This is when father told us wonderful tales and legends. I remember the time he told us a Celtic saga. They were marvelous unforgettable experiences. 

00:21:05

00:21:05
Lutz Neummann Jung's Grandson 

00:21:10
LUTZ NEUMMANN He taught me how to sail. He was, at least in part, a very tough teacher. When the wind died down, and our boat was immobilized in the middle of the lake, He told us to make a lot of noise with the oars, to irritate the wind, and make it blow again. It sounds absurd, but sometimes the trick worked. Grandpa insisted that even things that were apparently meaningless had to be taken seriously. he was always ready for any kind of joke, game, or ritual with us children. However, he demanded diligence and total dedication. We had to take each other seriously, even when playing This was one of his great teachings. We were not aware of it at the time. It was only later that I realized my good fortune in having had such an extraordinary grandfather. Today I feel sorry I didn't learn more from him. 

00:22:20
AGATE When we went camping on the island we were in complete harmony with nature. We slept under a tent for four weeks, regardless of the weather. We cooked and ate outside. in sunshine and in rain. At night we were lulled by the songs of the water birds and the sound of the waves. Around the campfire father told us about his travels and his adventures. He knew some marvelous stories. For me those nights were magical. He had the tents brought over from England. They were British officers' tents. At that time camping was not as popular as it is today. No one ever went on the island of lake Zurich. Our outings were always a bit adventurous, but it was good fun. In Summer, he sometimes took us to the mountains, always off the beaten track. For we children this was exciting, But mother used to worry about our safety. 

00:23:45
GRET He enjoyed cooking very much. On one occasion, I remember, It was pouring rain. We were soaked to the skin, and water was seeping into the tent. Everything was sopping wet, and we children had to protect ourselves as best we could. Father remained outside, in the rain, stoking the fire that threatened to go out any minute. It took him seven hours to cook a pike that he had seasoned with a lot of herbs. He stayed outside wearing an old hat and an oilskin coat. After seven hours the fish was finally done, and we enjoyed it huddled together. 

00:24:35
GEORGE MCGRATH Gradually, through my scientific work, I could give my fantasies a solid base. Words on paper however, did not give me the impression of being sufficiently concrete. I needed something more. I had to create a testimony of faith in stone. This was the origin of the tower. The house that I build myself in Bollingen. At first I did not plan a real house, just a kind of primitive one story dwelling. It had to be round with a fireplace in the middle. I had in mind an African hut with a fire surrounded by a few stones, burned in the center. Primitive huts give the idea of integrity. I wanted to build a dwelling that corresponded to man's original instincts. So, in 1923, the first round construction was built and when it was completed I saw that it was really a tower. 

00:25:45
GRET He had always cherished the dream of owning a tower. At first he wanted to buy a ready built one, but then he changed his mind. He used to build model fortresses. Bollingen is based on one such model He was looking for stability, for protection. When I was young I could not understand why he had such narrow windows built. He had to stay inside bolting doors and windows, perhaps to cut himself off from external influences. He was very sensitive and open to psychic influences. I think that in order to concentrate and write, He had to isolate himself completely from the outside world. 

00:26:40
LUTZ NEUMMANN Before building the tower of Bollingen, with his own hands, he spent six weeks in a quarry to learn how to break stones. He always wanted to learn everything in depth. He was an intellectual who was also blessed with manual skills. He was able to draw, paint, and sculpt. 

00:27:10
ROBERT MCGRATH In 1927, I added the central building. After four more years the tower shaped annex was turned into a real tower and in 1935, again four years later, I built a fourth element. The four sections of the building were constructed over exactly 12 years. In Bollingen I find my true nature, an environment where I can express who I really am. I become, so to speak, a primeval son of the mother. The tower is a place of growth, it is the mother's womb where I can become what I was, what I am and what I will be. Sometimes I feel as if I have expanded into the landscape and inside objects as if I am alive in every tree, in the waves, in animals, in the clouds that come and go, in all things. There's nothing here that has grown and has developed over the decades to which I do not feel linked. Everything here has its history and mine. There is space for the infinite subterranean realm of the psyche. In Bollingen I am surrounded by almost tangible silence. Thoughts that date back centuries emerge and at the same time they suggest a distant future. Creativity is no longer a struggle instead it is closely related to play. I manage without electricity. I light the fire and the stove myself. In the evening, I light old fashion lamps. There's no running water so I pump water from the well. I chop wood and cook food. These simple acts make a man humble. It is so difficult to be humble. 

00:29:30

00:29:30
Deiter Baumann Jung's grandson 

00:29:40
DEITER BAUMANN I don't remember who told me this story. One day my grandfather was sitting here, outside the tower. He was like a taoist sage, in full harmony with both the internal and the external world. A bird landed on his head, and stayed there for about ten minutes. 

00:30:10
[music] 

00:30:25
GRET At first the tower was haunted by ghosts. They even disturbed Father. As for me, I certainly would not have slept in the tower on my own. 

00:30:35
AGATE I used to sleep alone in my tent. Every night I woke up with a jolt because I had the impression a man was poking his head through the opening. Every night I knotted the strings tightly, but to no avail. One day I talked about this apparition at breakfast. The reaction was laughter. Angrily, I yelled that I could not understand why he had built a house on top of corpses. The result of my outburst was, or course, that my father poked even more fun at me. Several years went by. One day I received a letter from my father "You were quite right." As they were digging to extend the house, he had found, two meters underground, a skeleton with a bullet in the elbow, in this position. Father buried the skeleton properly and fired a three gun salute in honor of the dead man. Then he engraved a tombstone. "TO THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER". From that day the ghosts disappeared, and I no longer felt any fear in that place. 

00:31:50
GEORGE MCGRATH In 1950, I erected a stone monument to express what the tower meant to me. On the side facing the lake I let the stone speak for itself with a Latin inscription: I am an orphan I am alone but I can be found anywhere. I am one but I have my opposite in front of me. I am both young and old. I have neither father nor mother and so must be drawn up from the depths, like a fish. I fall from the sky like a white stone. I roam forests and mountains but I am hidden in man's deepest recesses. I am mortal, yet the changes of time do not affect me. Here is an ordinary stone who's price is rather modest. The more it is despised by fools, the more it is loved by the wise. Time is a boy who plays dice. This is Telesphorus, who scours the dark regions of the cosmos and shines like a star. He shows the gateway to the sun and to the land of dreams. 

00:33:15
GRET When I was a child, during our Sunday walks, he always stopped at puddles to let the water flow out with the help of his walking stick. In Bollingen there was a narrow stream. He used to spend hours there, digging small channels that would allow the stagnant water to reach the lake. He sat bent forward on a small chair He did things that were very down to earth while he was thinking, so that his thoughts followed the right path. 

00:33:55
DEITER BAUMANN I would say he was seeking the source and the origin of life, through these actions, through this kind of play and through his scientific activity. These were actually two aspects of the same thing. Jung lived in a symbolic way, combining mind and matter. 

00:34:20
GEORGE MCGRATH The sea in which the fish swim unconsciously has come to an end. The water is now in the jug of Aquarius, that is in the vase of consciousness. We are divided by instinct from the unconscious so we must feed our instinct in order not to wither for this reason. Aquarius pours the water for the fish to drink. 

00:34:45
GRET He continued sculpting even at an advanced age, working well beyond his strength, as if he were spurred on by some demon. He treated matter with extreme care. 

00:35:00
GEORGE MCGRATH To beautiful artists, to the eternal splendor of life. 

00:35:10
GRET Intellectuals angered him with their abstract questions that were so remote from reality. When he worked on his sculptures he used to say: "This is really producing something." Men think that to make their dreams come true they have only to talk about them, they get drunk on the images of their dreams. 

00:35:40
LUTZ NEUMMANN An acquaintance, who was going through some difficult times, came to my grandfather, thinking it was time for analysis. Grandfather told him: "Nonsense! Have a cervelat (a swiss sausage)!" - So bringing him back to reality. Grandfather never used high-sounding words, he never paraded his knowledge. He was very down to earth, very natural. He was on very good terms with the workers on the building site. They understood him, and he understood them. 

00:36:30
CARLO ALTOMARE Jung was endowed with a formidable intuition that allowed him to grasp the infinite variety and the indeterminate nature of psychic phenomenon. In Ascona, during the Eranos meetings Jung compared his findings and burgeoning research to the most disparate scientific subjects. Some of the most brilliant minds of our century sat around the famous round table. Jung left an impressive number of books on his analytical and philosophical experiences. He was very much ahead of his time, in fact, only recently have we begun to comprehend the revolutionary scope of his work. Some of his intuitions are only understandable in the context of enormous time spent. However, as he himself said, anything that is valuable exacts its price. It requires a lot of time and a lot of patience. Jung is often misunderstood. The only ones who understand him are those who have been able to question their life long beliefs and learning, who rely completely on themselves and look without prejudice into the farthest recesses of their soul for guidance. According to Jung, every man and every woman carries within himself or herself an element of the other sex both biologically and psychologically. The woman hidden in the psyche of a man and the man hidden in the psyche of a woman are like bridges, mediators that lead to the deepest areas of the unconscious. In the course of life they become guides to the exploration of the self. During the Eranos meetings Jung presented his concept of archetype; a word that etymologically means "original mark." Jung had noticed that in the myths, legends and tales of every culture, whatever their origin, dominant themes and images are recurrent. The same images were found by Jung in the dreams, hallucinations and fantasies of his patients and he inferred that these were important building blocks in our original psyche. For Jung, our mind, like our body, has its own history. Elements of one's past are deposited in the unconscious as they are in the body. By examining this kind of sediment we can sometimes connect consciousness to its profound origins, its distant past, its roots. The study of alchemy was one of Jung's main interests. Through laborious and tedious processes alchemists were trying to transform lead into gold. They were looking for the philosopher's stone or universal medicine. The more perceptive of them realized that this long process of transformation of matter also implied a profound transformation of the mind and the spirit. It was Jung who discovered that for those who can understand it the work of the alchemist is like an open door to the complicated processes of psychic transformation, very similar to those that occur in the unconscious of modern man. According to Jung, by projecting his own psyche onto the matter on which he was working the alchemist often unconsciously tried to overcome conflict in his own character and to achieve unity. He stole from matter that spark of life and spirit that could give meaning to his long labor which is exactly what the analyst does with the raw matter of the unconscious. The goal of their work was the so called chemical wedding that to the formation of the whole person.

00:42:15
GEORGE MCGRATH At the beginning of 1944 I broke my leg. This mishap was followed by a heart attack. When I was unconscious I was delirious and had visions. I had the impression I was suspended in midair. Beneath me, in the distance I could see the globe in a splendid blue light. I could see the continents and the dark blue color of the oceans. In many places the globe was colored or had dark green patches like oxidized silver. I could see the reddish yellow desert of Arabia. It was as if the silver of the Earth at that point had taken on a golden red shade. Then there was the red sea. I knew I was about to leave this world. I saw a huge boulder a short distance away. It was suspended in the cosmic space and I too floated in the cosmos. A few steps led up to the door of a temple. I had the feeling my whole past was suddenly taken away from me. Nevertheless, something remained. I was my personal history and I knew with absolute certainty this is what I am. This experience gave me a feeling of extreme grief and at the same time of utter satisfaction. There was nothing I wanted or desired. There was no regret for anything that had disappeared or that had been taken away from me. On the contrary, I possessed everything I was and nothing more. I felt certain that I was entering a lit room and meeting all the people that I belonged to. There, finally I would understand their historical bond on which my ego and my life depended. I wouldn't recognize what was before me, the reason for my coming into the world and the direction in which my life would continue to flow. Suddenly, from below, from Europe, the image of my doctor came back to me. He told me that there was opposition to my decision to leave. I did not have the right to leave this world. I had to come back. And the vision ended. My illness was followed by a period of intense activity. Many of my main works were written at that time. The knowledge or intuition that I had of the end of my life gave me the courage to make new conjectures. From then on I was never free from the impression that this life is only a fragment of existence and folding in the three dimensional universe that was created for this purpose. I prefer not to use the world eternal but I can only describe my experience as bliss of a non-temporal nature in which present, past and future are one. It is that man orients himself towards the infinite. This is the central issue of his life. The more man pursues false goals the less open he is to what is essential, the less satisfactory his life is. He will feel limited because his goals are limited. If we understand and feel that we already have a link with the infinite then our desires and our attitudes will change. Yet we can reach the feeling of the infinite only if we are individuated at the highest possible level. If I acknowledge my own limits I can also become aware of the unlimited. We need, above all, to know ourselves to see without doubt how much good we can do but also how much we can degrade ourselves. Everyone has their shadow. The less it is integrated into the conscious life of the individual the more dark and threatening it becomes. Nobody is above the dark collective shadow of humanity. It is a good thing to be able to imagine evil. As only fools neglect the roots of their own nature. Terrible things have happened and continue to happen but they are always attributed to the actions of others. Yet we carry within ourselves the unchanged and irremovable ability and inclination to repeat such acts. For as human beings we are also potential criminals. Both in my experience and in my experience of life I have often found myself confronted with the mystery of love and I have never been able to explain it. It comprises the maximum and the minimum, the farthest and the nearest, the highest and the lowest and you can never talk about one without considering the other. Love suffers everything and bears everything. These words say all there is to say. There is nothing more to add because we are. in the deepest sense, victims or means and instruments of cosmic love. Being just one part man cannot apprehend the whole. He is at its mercy. Love is never lacking whether it talks in the language of angels or traces the life of a cell with scientific precision going back to its ultimate origin. If he possesses a grain of wisdom man will lay down arms and will call the unknown by the most unknown; that is the by the name of God. It will be a confession of imperfection, of dependency and of submission but at the same time a statement of his free will to choose between truth and error.

CARLO ALTOMARE On the gable of his house in Kusnacht Carl Gustav Jung had a sign carved in Latin. 

00:50:05
GEORGE MCGRATH The first man comes from the earth and is earthly. The second man comes from heaven and is spiritual. Whether you call him or not God will be present. 

00:50:25

00:50:30
CARLO ALTOMARE He had erected a monument to the creative demon who had driven him throughout his entire life. In pursuit of his own visions and his brilliant psychological intuitions, which are still not fully understood or accepted. He called it Atmavictu, the breath of life. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:55
GRET He remained motionless for 24 hours before he died, and was not responsive. He was far away. His last breaths were so marvellously liberated that there was no room in my heart for sadness. A quarter of an hour after his death, with a frightening crash, a flash of lightning, a bolt from the blue split a poplar in the garden in two.
