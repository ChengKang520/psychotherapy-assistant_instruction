TONY RODGERS I just experienced many symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, um, and I, I thought I, it was just uniquely me.

DAVID LISAK Boys are sexually abused in, um, in vast numbers and vastly more frequently than as a society we're recognizing. 

00:00:30
Mark Crawford 

00:00:35
MARK CRAWFORD I was absolutely amazed, that in fact it was so common among sexual abuse survivors. Of feeling alone, or feeling it was only you. 

00:00:45
TONY RODGERS I know that childhood rape separated me from my spirit, I thought I was broken most of my life. I struggled, fought, cried, prayed and meditated my way back to me. While he was raping me, he, I felt like I left my body because I thought I was gonna die. So, I wasn't present then actually I had, had agreed to die at that point. And I remember seeing flashes of my family: my grandmother, my mother, my sister, my father, my cousins and it was because of the love that I had, I wanted to return to them. I felt like I was obligated to come back to all of them. And so, when he walked away from me I thought he was gonna strangle me, and so, I got up and I ran. Immediately after, um, I was raped, I, my grandmother just died last year, but she, she took me from my mom for about three months. And I don't think I would have lived if my grandmother hadn't done that. She nurtured me and sheltered me and brought me back to myself. Like I always remember what my grandmother did for me cause I still remember things for myself that she did. She gave me warm baths and she would just tickle me at night and just, she wouldn't, she never talked about it. And if anyone did say anything about it, she would just say he's strong, he's himself and he's fine like he is. 

00:02:35
[music] 

00:02:35
TONY RODGERS Because of my upbringing and just the pride that was instilled I was able to continue to do so many successful things. I graduated from UC Berkeley, I'm a teacher, I've taught for 14 years. I've motivated many, many young people to be their greatest self. And even through my pain I was still able to help other people work through their own shame and guilt, and even denial about childhood sexual abuse. 

00:03:15
DAVID LISAK Bring me the ball. 

00:03:20
[music] 

00:03:20
DAVID LISAK My mother decided she had to, um, find some way of earning a living. She was a single mother, uh, my brother was seven-years-old and I was five-years-old. So, she hired a boarder, he was a young man, I think he was about 18 or 19 years old. She hired him to live in the house and take care of my brother and I and I don't have any exact memories of when the abuse started. I have fragments of memories. The worst memories are of when he, um, when he anally raped me. Uh, and the worst part of that is, uh, um, he must have had my head on a pillow, because the, uh, um, I was suffocating. 

00:04:25
[music] 

00:04:30
DAVID LISAK And if you asked me at any point during my adolescence or during my 20's, during my late 20's, during my early 30's whether I was abused as a child, if anybody had ever sexually abused me, or anything like that, I would absolutely and confidently said no. Well if the child doesn't think there's anybody there to help them, then they're better off losing access to the memories and sort of just going on with childhood, going on with development, as, as best they can. 

00:05:00
[music] 

00:05:15
DAVID LISAK It's just that I don't feel it's legitimate to indulge that desire to be anonymous, and it's not something that should be a secret.

ST. ANDREW RECTORY 

00:05:40
MARK CRAWFORD This is the church, it's been a long time since I've been in there. This here is the rectory and the windows you can see there, just under that tree limb, was in fact his room. He had the entire thing set up, uh, with a model train layout and, of course, I was into trains. So I loved that, and that's how he first got me to go up to his room to see his train sets. 

00:06:00
Mark's Abuser Father Kenneth L. Martin

00:06:05
MARK CRAWFORD I was 13, when the abuse first started. And, uh, he abused me several times a week for several years, all over this country, and even on that trip to Europe. 

00:06:20
[music] 

00:06:35
MARK CRAWFORD Believe it or not strangely as this may sound, um, going to church was a safe place for me, because it didn't happen in church. And, and I would spend a lot of quiet time there and to this day, I find great sanctuary in a quiet church. 

00:06:55

Congratulations on your Communion Joshua 

00:07:00
MARK CRAWFORD The man who abused me, constantly told me how much he loved me, how important I was in his life and this was normal, this is what happens when people love each other. There were days I was scared for my life, as he became very physical and violent with me at times, and I was just terrified. Terrified to come forward, terrified to speak out. After my abuse and my attempt to break away from this man, he began to take the same interest and do the same things with my younger brother, and that concerned me. And it definitely galvanized my absolute determination to send a message, to speak a truth, to help another survivor without a doubt.

00:08:00
TONY RODGERS This is where I moved to, when I came from Missouri, was to West Oakland. It was a culture shock, moving here from, um, St. Louis, cause, uh, my family was very close knit and I moved here, not to have many relatives here. And I never really lived around a lot of drug infestation, and when I came here it was like, everywhere. So, I, uh, my freshman year in high school I was always in the office for fighting, throwing chairs and just being really, really angry. Um, one of the Vice-Principals told me that they were thinking about expelling me from the school. And he said that it wouldn't even be any use because I would either wind up killing someone or someone was gonna kill me if I didn't control my emotional state. And I heard him and I knew that I wanted to live more than anything and, um, that's when the light went off. And I started really thinking about what I was angry about and I knew I was hurt about what happened to me. But I didn't know how to talk about it. And, uh, um, the summer after that, my freshman year I actually mentioned it to a friend, that I remember being raped, when I was nine. Hey, what's going on? 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Hey, what's up? How you been? 

00:09:30
TONY RODGERS Good, good. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN What's up? 

00:09:30
TONY RODGERS Good to see you. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN You, too. 

00:09:30
TONY RODGERS We had to move that tree. Being a man means you can have multiple emotions and feelings and it's OK to get help. Like I didn't know that asking for help would make me powerful. I always thought that asking for help would make me appear to be weak or not man enough. But actually asking for help is the most, uh, um, profound act of kindness that I can do for myself. 

00:10:00
[music] 

00:10:00
DAVID LISAK I was 17 in this picture. I had decided I was going to hitchhike across country. I was already at this point so rebellious that my mother realized there was no way that she was gonna stop me. That if she tried to stop me I would just, I would just run away. 

00:10:20
[music] 

00:10:20
DAVID LISAK Twice, once when I was 16, and once when I was about 23 or 24, I sat with the barrel of a rifle in my mouth, and my finger on the trigger. And you know, a twitch would have been it. So, you know, that's not exactly the diagnosis of a happy guy. When I was, um, uh, a graduate student, and a young professional first starting out and I realized that trauma was gonna be my domain of professional expertise. I'd been doing research on trauma, I'd been doing research on men who were sexually abused as children and physically abused as children. I'd been doing research on the, the links between abuse and violence. And I'm driven to try to help other men and it's not a coincidence, of course that, it is, it is because I was abused as a child. 

00:11:25
[music] 

00:11:25
MARK CRAWFORD I remember being in high school and you know something so normal when boys are in the locker room for gym getting changed and I would not take off my underwear, did not want to be seen naked. I was so ashamed of who I was. I thought that somehow people could know or tell. Being a workaholic, staying busy that's how I handled it. If I was busy enough and, and kept going, there, there wasn't time to focus on those feelings. Over time I realized, you're living this life as this person you're not and you almost feel like a phony because you're very cold and removed and aloof and, and I mean that's how I felt. And you're not spontaneous. 

00:12:15
[music] 

00:12:15
MARK CRAWFORD There was nothing more liberating. I can't recall a bigger step in my own healing than when I broke my silence and told my story. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN See ya later. 

00:12:35
MARK CRAWFORD And when you learn to hope and trust and understand it's OK to be able to express yourself. Even if it's something simple like playing with your kids. 

00:12:50
[music] 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN I'm your mother. 

00:12:50
MARK CRAWFORD In a very slow and disarming way you learn that it's OK to be yourself, to be spontaneous. 

00:13:00
MARK'S SON Can I go on the (inaudible ) now? 

00:13:05
MARK'S DAUGHTER Yeah, I wanna. 

00:13:05
DAVID LISAK There are so few men who've been abused, that are getting help. It's tragic, it's, it means there's so much more suffering than there needs to be. 

00:13:15
TONY RODGERS When I would call around to rape crisis centers and places that said they specialized in childhood sexual abuse, but no one had any place for men and when they would. When I would ask them questions about men, everyone always thought I was a perpetrator. So, they were like you can call, you know, Men Against Violence or other organizations that help men recover from hurting women and children. But I would always say, no, I was actually raped as a child, I'm the one who needs rape counseling. 

00:13:45
MARK CRAWFORD My therapist often said, "You need to find a group of men, you know where you can speak about this issue. You know, I think that would help you." 

00:13:55
DAVID LISAK One of the most amazing experiences I had in this regard was working with Male Survivor. I had the privilege of being one of the therapists for one of their weekends of recovery. And you watch these men walk into the room and look around and for so many of them it's the first time they have ever walked into a room and seen other men who've been abused. And routinely you see men starting to weep. Not a word has been spoken, nothing has been formally done or said, and they begin weeping because they realize they're not alone. 

00:14:30
[music] 

00:14:35
TONY RODGERS After I did ther-, I did a group therapy, it was a coed group with men and women, we did it for nine months, I talked with a friend of mine about it. Who disclosed to me that he had, had experienced childhood sexual abuse. And he knew of a guy who made a mini film about it and so we met up and then we talked about forming a group and then we all just met up from there so it was self-started. What makes it part of my healing process has been in like fellowshipping with other men, um, and trusting, you know and being able to be vulnerable and be close and not feel like I was under threat or that anyone would take anything from me. 

00:15:15
MAN1 For me, mine was a family member, so, uh, I was a little kid, I, my family was everything, that's what I was taught. And, uh, I'm like really if that's what people who love you and you supposed to trust do then what else in the world. 

00:15:30
MAN2 Both of my offenders were adolescents, one within and one from without the family and one female, one male. 

00:15:40
MAN3 My experience happened when I was eight, it was extremely violent, um, it involved a group of boys, um, one of whom was a family member and, uh, this was not about sex this was annihilation and something in me froze at that point. Stunted my development and stayed that way until I was 27. 

00:16:05
MAN1 And how amazing is that? That eight-year-old could somehow adjust a part in their brain to sort of allow that to sit and store until the grown-up can start to deal with it. 

00:16:15
MAN4 When he started touching inappropriately I didn't, you know , I thought, oh, OK, this is things that they get to do. No one that's nine-years-old wants that. You know. 

00:16:25
TONY RODGERS One of my perpetrators, um, was a cousin that I idolized, um, and then the other person was a complete stranger, I didn't know him. But he had been a serial rapist in the community raping other children. I knew what the pain was like of holding it in. I knew what it was like to be self-destructive. I knew what it was like to feel hopelessness all the time. I mean to wake up and regret being alive. I knew what that experience was like. So, I knew that every step that I took towards healing was better than the step that I took back. 

00:16:55
MAN2 My coping mechanism for a long time was alcohol and drugs which I think is common with, you know, men or anyone, um, dealing with traumatic situations. 

00:17:05
MAN4 Until I owned what had happened, it had been suffering up to that point and then the pain of, uh, owning it was kind of when the healing started. 

00:17:15
MAN2 I'm grateful that, uh, this is the route that, uh, my healing path has taken and in our healing path together and starting this group. This is what gives me hope. Um, seeing men get together and talk about other things and talk about actually how they're feeling and their hurts and, uh, and their struggles and their triumphs. So, grateful to be here. 

00:17:40
MAN3 This group has been, uh, beyond words amazing for me and my healing.

Former Archbishop of Newark, NJ Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick 

00:17:55
MARK CRAWFORD Finally got an audience with the bishop. Who, we talked and he made some promises. He promised to keep the man who abused me away from children. He promised to involve me and allow me to be involved in educating other seminarians, clergy members about clergy abuse. Well after that meeting I never heard from him again and just a few months later I found out this man was returned to the ministry in the town in which I was working after they knew he'd abused my brother and I he was promoted to be the Archbishop's personal secretary. He was a pastor in a very large parish and had plenty of access to children, quite disturbing. How offended I was that they kept asking for a confidentiality agreement.

ST. ANDREW RECTORY 

00:18:45
MARK CRAWFORD At that time when I reported him under New Jersey law they were required to report him to the police, they did not. Had they the criminal statute of limitations would have still been in effect and he would have been held accountable. But because they did not he is a free man today. 

00:19:05
[music] 

00:19:05
MARK CRAWFORD Right here in New Jersey, we found men, priests, who were removed from the priesthood for sexually abusing scores of children. and they're still living and working among us today. It's outrageous, these men are counselors, they're therapists, there's, they're working psychologists, they're teaching in our colleges, Latin and ethics and it's absolutely unacceptable. Thank you so much for coming. 

00:19:30
Nora, Survivor Activist, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) 

00:19:30
NORA Your welcome. I'm here, Mark called. It's about a Robert Ugault(ph) who was a priest who has just admitted and been found guilty of sexually abusing a 14 year old boy. And at one point in time in his life this, this priest, he actually worked here as a chaplain in this hospital. 

00:19:50
MARK CRAWFORD Here's what we're gonna do today. OK? We're gonna go inside. 

00:19:55
NORA All right. 

00:19:55
MARK CRAWFORD We're gonna, um, try and (inaudible ) hospital. 

00:20:00
NORA All right. 

00:20:00
MARK CRAWFORD (inaudible ) I wanna, I want to ask what she's done now that, uh, (inaudible ). 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Excuse me. You have to get off of our grounds. Please. Sir, sir please leave the grounds , now. 

00:20:20
CAMERAMAN OK. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Please go on to the sidewalk. 

00:20:25
CAMERAMAN OK. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:20:25
MARK CRAWFORD They knew we were coming they were waiting for us. They immediately came out and they chased the crew away, so, while I'm certain they saw the press release that went out last night or somebody gave them a heads up or maybe a reporter called and asked questions about our statement and, um, they were just waiting to pounce on us. 

00:20:45

00:20:45
MARK CRAWFORD You know people ask why are we standing here today. Born in 1945, Carmen C. Sita was ordained a priest of the New York archdiocese in 1976, and in the 80's, he was convicted of sexually abusing a boy in Jersey City. He was then sent to a church run center for pedophile priests in New Mexico. I will never stop, until any institution understands you cannot take a known predator and put them in front of children. It's it is putting the wolf in the hen house. 

00:21:20
[music] 

00:21:20
DAVID LISAK Um, summer of '63, I guess I was nine-years-old. This is our family, my mother, my brother and I. This is probably right at the, um, right at the threshold of when I, I'd been alienated and kind of separated from my brother and my mother. Somewhere deep inside me I still feel what it was like to live for that long in a home where I was being subjected to that kind of physical and sexual torture and nobody was doing anything about it. There's almost no way that a five-year-old doesn't experience that as they don't care. 

00:22:05
[music] 

00:22:10
DAVID LISAK Here's my graduation photo at, uh, from Duke, when I got my Ph.D. several months after I'd called my mother and gotten some information from her without telling her why I was asking I decided I had to tell her and I wrote this long letter to her. So, she, I sat down in the living room and she sat down at the kitchen table and read the letter. It was probably 15 pages. You know, she started crying. I can only imagine what it must have been like to have been a parent and find out something had happened to your kid like that, it was probably the first time we'd had a meaningful conversation in 20 years. I know that she, when she died, she felt much more at peace because we'd been able to establish some kind of meaningful connection. 

00:23:10
[music] 

00:23:15
TONY RODGERS My entire family was affected by that experience. So when they caught the guy and they brought him to trial it was after my tenth birthday and, uh, um, sort of the after the trial was done, my dad left. I felt like he left because he had a son who couldn't defend himself and my father, you know , taught me to fight he taught me to box, and play football and then he just left. So, I felt like he left because I was weak, it was true. My mom was sad and depressed with my dad's departure and she had been hospitalized so we went in the care of my dad's sister and while we were there, um, that's when my cousin sexually assaulted me. I wanted to be so much like him, all of my life, and so, just within less than a 24 hour period he turned into a monster. Even though I have nine brothers, it was really hard to be close with all of my brothers, because, um, I just felt betrayed by people that love me. And then just it was hard for me even to be close to my male friends so I always had really, really close, uh, female friends and I had male friends but I always kept them at bay. 

00:24:25
DAVID LISAK It created a wall, between me and other men. One of the transformative experiences I had was in mid '90's, I met Larry. Larry Morris, um, who, had written one of the first books on male survivors of sexual abuse. And Larry and I had been, you know, hiking in the Grand Canyon together for the last , oh, 12, 13 years. Larry's been an extremely important person in my life and I'm not sure I can say this without starting to cry but, um, dropping me off at the airport and I'm taking all my gear out of the car and, uh, hugged each other to say goodbye and he, um, he said I love you. And that was the first time I'd ever heard those words from a man.

THRU TRAFFIC NEXT EXIT 1 MILE EXIT 15 E Newark Jersey City 

00:25:35
MARK CRAWFORD Today we're going to meet with Senator Joseph Vitale. Pat Serrano, a tremendous supporter and advocate, uh, whose own son was abused by a member of the clergy. And Greg Gianforcaro, is an attorney who I often consult with, uh, when we're discussing legislation. Today what we'll talk about several New Jersey bills that already exist regarding the Statute of Limitations. The goal is to eliminate the Statute of Limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors or children. 

00:26:10
New Jersey has one of the most restrictive statutes in the country, allowing the victim only 2 years from the age of 18 to take civil action against the offender. 

00:26:15

00:26:15
CSAKI BUILDING 569 LEGISLATIVE OFFICE OF Senator Joseph Vitale 

00:26:30
MARK CRAWFORD Squeeze on by. Thank you. Good morning, Senator. Good to see you again thank you for taking the time to meet with us, uh, this morning. We want to talk about, uh, the initiative to move the statute of limitations, eliminating the statute of limitations for, uh, crimes committed against children, sexual abuse crimes. Criminally we saw fit in 1992 to eliminate the Statute of Limitations for these crimes; yet civilly it's still two years from the age of 18, very restrictive. And if somebody is recovering from post-traumatic stress, depression then you're in no shape to do that within two years. I know that from personal experience. 

00:27:10
SENATOR VITALE You better look at the sponsors and the co-sponsors are of the charitable immunity bill to see where you get some leadership. 

00:27:15
MARK CRAWFORD OK. 

00:27:15
SENATOR VITALE You can use those names as a resource for sponsoring this bill. But you'd have to support charitable immunity to get it. So you'd have to really educate, re-educate someone from scratch in terms of what the bill does or seeks to do. It's a starting point. 

00:27:25
MARK CRAWFORD Good. 

00:27:30
SENATOR VITALE You'd have it, you have it in other parts of the law, now why shouldn't you extend this now to victims of sexual abuse which is probably one of the most sickening crimes against people. We'll work to get it done. 

00:27:40
MARK CRAWFORD Yes. 

00:27:40
SENATOR VITALE All right. 

00:27:40
MARK CRAWFORD Yes. Absolutely, thank you so much. 

00:27:40
PAT SERRANO Thank you for your time. 

00:27:45
GREG GIANFORCARO Thanks Senator. 

00:27:45
SENATOR VITALE Your welcome. Great job. Good to see you. 

00:27:45
MARK CRAWFORD Without a doubt, it'll be my effort to change that Statute of Limitations, I will not stop, it will not end. I know it's only a matter of time. 

00:27:55
MARK'S OLDER DAUGHTER Nothing, I have nothing (inaudible ). 

00:27:57
MARK CRAWFORD Oh, OK. Bring me the change. 

00:28:00
MARK'S OLDER DAUGHTER Thanks. 

00:28:00
MARK CRAWFORD (inaudible )Go let her see that. 

00:28:05
MARK'S OLDER DAUGHTER All right. 

00:28:10
MARK CRAWFORD Be careful, be safe. All right. 

00:28:10
MARK'S OLDER DAUGHTER Bye Mom. Bye. Bye guys. 

00:28:15
GERALYN CRAWFORD (inaudible ) He does a lot of, um, with SNAP and with the Senator and, you know, he's away from the house a lot. So, it's affecting the kids, it's affecting me our schedules are always hectic. And, um, you know sometimes he comes back and he's in a good mood and sometimes you know, I guess how ever deep the meetings could be. He can come back and he can just be in one of those really, moods that you know that anything you say or do and he'll snap or he'll just be very tense, more tense, more stressed, you know. Like he hasn't put himself back to that normalcy, and he's still at that level, so it's, it's hard to deal with. So. 

00:29:05
MARK CRAWFORD But, I was working weekends, so there's definitely time now, when as a family we're all together for the whole day, so. 

00:29:15
GERALYN CRAWFORD Right. 

00:29:15
MARK CRAWFORD So, that opportunity was not afforded until recently and that makes a big difference. 

00:29:20
GERALYN CRAWFORD It does. 

00:29:20
MARK CRAWFORD To me, I mean, it makes a big difference. 

00:29:20
GERALYN CRAWFORD It does. Yeah. 

00:29:25
MARK CRAWFORD So, what are you doing right now, huh.? 

00:29:25
MARK'S SON I, I was on the computer. 

00:29:25
MARK CRAWFORD You were on the computer. Where on the computer? What website? 

00:29:30
MARK'S SON HotWheels.com. 

00:29:30
MARK CRAWFORD HotWheels.com. I should have known. Fossilized fruit? 

00:29:35
MARK'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER Well, yeah, we have to use the fruit cause we can't use a fossil. 

00:29:40
MARK CRAWFORD Oh, OK.

DUE PROCESS 

00:29:45
RAYMOND BROWN It's a Statute that most New Jerseyians may never have heard of might even be shocked by, but it's been the law since 1958. I'm Raymond Brown, and it's called Charitable Immunity, it protects churches, charities, private schools from lawsuits even in cases of child sex abuse. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Victims with stories like Mark Crawford's. His claim that after years of abuse by his parish priest. 

00:30:10
MARK CRAWFORD They said look you just stay away from him and he's gonna stay away from you. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN But this man's tenacity, his insistence that his charges be heard, could change New Jersey law. 

00:30:15
Testimony New Jersey State Assembly 

00:30:20
MARK CRAWFORD Charitable Immunity laws were established to shield these organizations from frivolous lawsuits. Some institutions in our state have effectively used this law as their pedophile protection policy. Honorable Assemblymen, when I attended grammar school I recall us reciting a pledge each day, you may recall the last few words of this pledge, "And justice for all." Not just for charities or non-profits, but for those who have already paid much to high a price. From May 1999, when I first walked into the Senator's office, so seven years, I've fought that battle. Along with many other people, cause no one person can do it alone, but I knew the truth would eventually prevail and justice would be done, and in fact it was.

New Jersey State Assembly vote to eliminate Charitable Immunity Protections December 2005 

00:31:10
UKNOWN On 3RDG Final Passage to pass for Senate Bill 540, sponsored by Senators Vitale, Gill, modifiers of the Charitable Immunity Act. 

00:31:15
SENATOR VITALE It's not easy when facing a gallery of victims and probably many hundreds like them who have suffered an unspeakable horror as to what was perpetrated on them particularly at young and tender ages. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN We don't hold charities accountable or charitable organizations accountable when they've known for years that children have been abused and it's an institutional condoning of crime. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN In all of my time down here in the legislature I have never felt more strongly about any piece of legislation. Please forget the technicalities, let us do what is right for these victims. 

00:32:05

00:32:25
MADAM CLERK Madam Speaker Senate Bill 540 has received 63 votes in the affirmative, 5 votes in the negative and 9 abstentions. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN It was one of the greatest days in our lives for victims. 

00:32:35
PAT SERRANO Yeah. Up in the balcony that night. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN It was amazing, it was amazing. 

00:32:40
PAT SERRANO So emotional. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN It was so emotional. Uh, it, it's a day that I'll never forget. 

00:32:45
SENATOR VITALE Through the legislation they certainly sent a very strong message to the institutions who are harboring, uh, sex offenders. That they can no longer get away with it. And Mark's advocacy and others I think will have a real impact in terms of protecting children and in those institutions. One thing I think Mark has to be more passionate than that.

DAVID LISAK Well I'm a forensic psychologist I've been researching child abuse, in particular the impact of sexual abuse on men. I started getting inquiries from attorneys who are representing men, uh, who'd been charged with serious crime basically all homicide. I evaluate the defendants and testify. I'm met JT, um, I believe it was 1994, he had been sentenced to death already. 

00:33:50
--that Mr. Babcock used. Ultimately, the abuse became extremely extensive. The -- it became overt and involved not only fondling but oral sex as well as anal sex. And this went on, again, Mr. Thomas could not remember precise dates or even how long in terms of, you know, a specific number of months or years but that it happened repeatedly and it happened over a long period of time. The next group of incidents that I -- are ... age twelve to fourteen, this occurred in San Diego. 

00:33:50
...And so where he went from the home was essentially to the streets. He would go out. He would hitchhike somewhere or he would just hang out, and he became a target. And over the years, and again, he could not remember an exact number of times that it happened except that it happened repeatedly, men, older men, would pick him up, and either because they had offered him a ride or they would offer him a meal... 

00:33:50
--this was actually his first sexual contact with a female other than when he was a child when he was abused by his Aunt Nancy. And these were actually pretty terrifying experiences for him. In particular, one, he didn't know anything about what was going on and Susan basically physically guided him and -- aroused him, got on top of him, and had intercourse with him and then got up and went back to her bedroom. And then Mr. Thomas noticed that, and I'm sorry, I have to be very graphic with this language but -- his penis was covered with blood. And he was petrified. He had no idea what had happened. And in retrospect, of course, he now understands that... 

00:33:50
DAVID LISAK I'm not sure that I've met anybody who had a worse history of sexual abuse, um, and JT was abused in other ways as well, psychologically and physically abused, um, but the sexual abuse was, um, just horrific, uh, started when he was five-years-old and went at least until he was 14. And I, I think I counted up, um, and really JT, he couldn't remember all the perpetrators, but at least a dozen to 16 perpetrators. Uh, including his own stepfather, who was in some ways the worst perpetrator. I'm not nervous about seeing JT. I'm looking forward to seeing JT. Um, I feel, um, this is my chance to say goodbye to him. If you've got children, male children, who get abused. Who get abused badly and get involved in substance abuse and even that of course is not any kind of guarantee that these kids are going to grow up and turn to violence, but it sure increases the odds.

00:35:15
DAVID LISAK How do you shake hands through this? 

00:35:15
JT Like this. 

00:35:15
DAVID LISAK Let's start going down the road. 

00:35:20
JT Yes, sir. 

00:35:20
DAVID LISAK So, what happened when you came in here, after the crime? 

00:35:25
JT Um, through some kind of crazy tragic means I had done to somebody else what I wanted to do to myself. This is my total failure as a human being, to have, uh, taken a life. 

00:35:50
[music] 

00:35:50
JT That's hard I don't need no more than that believe me, it's crushing. 

00:35:55
DAVID LISAK Do you remember any point at which you came close to telling somebody about what had happened to you? 

00:36:10
JT Mm-hmm, sure. 

00:36:15
DAVID LISAK When? 

00:36:15
JT My sister, when she left home. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
JT I think I tried to tell her, I know I tried to tell her but I tried to use different terms, I'm scared. Words around it, but never being specific. 

00:36:30
DAVID LISAK Since you've been here have you talked to other inmates who were abused? 

00:36:35
JT Yes, I have. 

00:36:40
DAVID LISAK And, what has it been like to hear them disclose that to you? 

00:36:50
JT I'm right there with them, feeling every bit of their pain and feeling every bit of their embarrassment. Um, they're feeling ashamed for them and I make it a point. Whether for the next 60 days or the next 90 days to never avoid that person to always look them in the eye. 

00:37:15
DAVID LISAK Mm-hmm, why? 

00:37:15
JT Because I don't want them to feel any bit of shame, having told somebody, they did the right thing. 

00:37:25
DAVID LISAK Right. 

00:37:25
JT And it was so, good for them, to cut that loose finally. 

00:37:30
DAVID LISAK Yeah. I think there's a lot that you could say to young men, who have been sexually abused. Who are running from it. 

00:37:50
JT Plain and simple, I thought I was the cause. 

00:37:55
DAVID LISAK The reason why these people were sexually abusing you. 

00:37:55
JT Yeah, I thought I was the cause. I, was it either something I did, something I communicated, um, unknowingly, uh, some kinda way I was the trigger for the. If I could let a young man know anything, it would be just the opposite of that. 

00:38:15
DAVID LISAK I need to be honest with you, um, one of the reasons, and one of the main reasons that I do this work, is that I was abused when I was a kid. And went through many of the same struggles. 

00:38:40
JT Thank you for sharing that. Well we give each other strength then that's what we do, you know. You remember that's what I got from you. I'm passing it forward. 

00:38:55
DAVID LISAK Yeah. 

00:39:00
[music] 

00:39:00
DAVID LISAK Anybody who's been abused and obviously I count myself amongst them. Um, goes down, um, their common paths the differences, you know, why I or somebody else didn't end up committing a crime that puts us into a prison like this sometimes it's just luck sometimes it's circumstance. Um, and often times it's because you know we had something that JT, for example, never had, somebody who really was there for us. Some member of the family, who, um, could take some responsibility for us, give us something that gets us through what we need to get through. 

00:40:00
TONY RODGERS Hey. What's up? 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN What are you doing? 

00:40:05
TONY RODGERS Making a movie that's about growing up out here or something. How you been? 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Fine. 

00:40:10
TONY RODGERS I saw your little granddaughter, she is so pretty. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible )How your mama doing? 

00:40:15
TONY RODGERS They doing good. See you later. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:20
TONY RODGERS Man I can't get in there. That's the way to get in but I'm not going in that way. The short cut, I can't fit through there anymore. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN You used to fit through there? 

00:40:35
TONY RODGERS Yeah. That was it so this is the corner right here, at 8th and Adeline, and the guy that I wanted to kill was actually he stayed posted right here on this corner. And as my sister and I crossed this street here he came and approached us and like I said he flipped up her hair and it bothered me and the guy he came here and we had the confrontation here. And that's when he asked me, what was I gonna do. And I ran home less than a minute away and came back and by the grace of God he was gone. Then I remember picking up the gun and running out of the house I was nervous. You know, my stomach was turning and I was just thinking of like maybe my mom could see me and make me stop. Or someone could make me stop cause I really didn't want to hurt him but if he was there I would have shot him. I know anybody who's toting a gun I know what it's like to do that. And I know what it's like to have so much anger and so much hurt and pain. That I would throw it out on someone else just because I wasn't satisfied with the way I was living. 

00:41:40
[music] 

00:41:45
MAN2 So you know for me it's all part of that patriarchal structure and socialization of men and silence and holding everything in. And then not having outlets to constructively deal with our anger, constructively deal with our grief or our pain. 

00:41:55
TONY RODGERS Being sensitive as a man, some people think you're a punk, or you're weak or you're sissy or you're a coward. but we all have that sensitivity and where does it go. 

00:42:05
MAN3 I was always the sensitive one, always the sensitive boy, um, still am, and, um, the sensitive man now though. Uh, um, you know, but that was my strength. You know my ability to convey what was going on for me is what, what helped me survive. 

00:42:20
MAN4 The Filipino community you know it's a culture of silence in itself. Well, I mean we dance and eat, but, you know, it's culture. The idea of talking about feelings publicly or, wasn't, wasn't an option. I was also young and, um, didn't have the vocabulary feeling wise or pain wise of how to express this, so... 

00:42:50
MAN1 As men we're, or as boys we're conditioned to just not cry, shut up, not share our problems, you know, uh, and so a lot of us live sort of isolated, uh, lives with our, you know, with our secrets, with our stories, with our struggles. It doesn't seem normal and so, uh, it's helpful to know that we're also walking parallel paths. 

00:43:15
MAN3 I wanted people to see me, I wanted people to know. It's funny, you know, it's so many years and still. You know, it, it, I wanted to be present and, and to say this is my pain, and you can't hide from it. Cause this happens to boys, this happens to men, and, and it's gotta stop. So. 

00:43:50
MARK CRAWFORD I don't think I have met a single survivor who could say well I never had some kind of, uh, crisis or sexual confusion. 

00:44:05
TONY RODGERS Men that I've met are reluctant to talk about their abuse because they don't want people to think that they are gay. And, um, sexuality really has nothing to do with abuse. But I definitely did question my own sexuality and in terms of questioning, um, just all of it cause it happened at a time right before, you know, I, it happened before I was sexually active. So, I just wondered like did I attract that type of energy to you. Not just the energy of a man but the energy of someone like violating me and abusing me. 

00:44:45
MAN4 The memory of being abused, I just used it as part of the oh, well I was gay so da, da, da, da, da, but, um at the time it happened early '60's we didn't have that word, so now I see that my, my excuse just falls apart. There was just, um, you know , I used it pretty much to cushion the idea that I had been abused. 

00:45:10
MAN3 You know I've had a lot of people ask me if, you know, if I'm, if I'm gay because of the rape, you know. And my stock answer is if, you know, if my rape, um, in any way affected me to be gay then I would choose men who, you know, beat me while they're having sex with me. You know, um, that would be my sexuality and that is absolutely not my sexuality. 

00:45:35
TONY RODGERS Rape is about power and control and it's not about sexuality. 

00:45:40
MARK CRAWFORD You know as you, one learn to heal and become more self-con-, uh, self-confident and aware of who you are, those questions are gone and you're more confident in who you are. 

00:45:50
TONY RODGERS Sexuality wasn't an issue as much as other people thinking that we would be predators, or sexual offenders. Because for me there were many well-intended people who would come and talk to my parents and say well you know as long as he doesn't grow up to be a rapist or a molester. But I would be present and hear those conversations so more than anything I didn't ever want that to be present in my life, even though I made a decision that I knew I would never do that to anyone, I just didn't want other people to think that and it has come up. 

00:46:25
DAVID LISAK I went into therapy for the first time, and it all happened very traumatically. Literally, during one session, um, I got flooded with flashbacks, um, and it was, I feel sorry for the analyst I think it must have been scary to, um, to witness. See they were vicious flashbacks, just, and I was literally convulsing. And over the years, uh, um, I've had more nightmares and flashbacks of, of being suffocated. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:05
CLAIRE HARWELL This is what I do professionally as well, so I'm obviously vested at another level when it's my partner, um, but it's the same skill. Is helping people remember that this terrifying thing that's happening inside is not happening out in the world and that if they can sort of find ways to feel their feet on the ground in the present they can re-enter the present. 

00:47:35
MARK CRAWFORD When I started experiencing flashbacks at night, sleeping in bed with my wife. I could be so startled that I would literally leap in the bed and I'd have no recollection of it, but, um, Lyn would often get up and maybe go sleep in the living room on the couch because I was so restless and maybe tormented, that's post-traumatic stress. 

00:48:00
TONY RODGERS Shortness of breath or just certain experiences I had, I thought it was uniquely me so I always thought I was abnormal and I never even connected it with, um, um, with my rape. 

00:48:15
MARK CRAWFORD Things normal men experience whether it be intimacy with their own spouse or partner, whatever it is. It's very different for that survivor, a simple touch could trigger, uh, memories or flashbacks, and it makes it very difficult to have a normal safe relationship. 

00:48:40
[music] 

00:48:40
TONY RODGERS All touch was seen as sexual, even if it was a family member. When I was younger after I'd been raped, I didn't know if they were approaching me sexually. It could be my mother or my dad, anyone, like I had an aversion to touch. 

00:48:50
MAN3 I would say I've got a ring of fire around me and, um, you know , it's a conscious effort to take that down. Um, to let people in to let myself out, so, you know, intimacy issues. 

00:49:05
MAN4 Ever since then it's been, um, not a sense of intimacy with anybody. It was a, a sense of, uh, I get to pick my perpetrator, yeah, he's cute so perpetrate me. 

00:49:20
MAN2 That is what we're socialized, you know, have this many girlfriend, you'll be a player, you know, do your thing. You know, you're just a man, of course if you're a woman and she does is a slut. But, um, for men it's what's expected. But even at that point what I was really reaching for was a real connection, love and all that. 

00:49:40
MAN3 I spent most of my life making horrible, inappropriate choices in terms of partners. 

00:49:45
TONY RODGERS I just ended a relationship, basically she just said that the way that I had lived my life was horrible and disgusting and I had to agree with her cause I have felt like so much of me was just unworthy. 

00:50:00
DAVID LISAK My relationships have been, many of them, you know, troubled and I would look back and take full blame or responsibility for the fact that, um, many of them didn't last. You know, I think largely because the, the baggage that I brought to them. 

00:50:20
MARK CRAWFORD If you can't love yourself, if you can't come to understand who you are, you know, you're not going to move forward. You'll probably get stuck in a place that, uh, is not, uh, healthy. But when, when you do make those efforts, when you do work at it, um, slowly those bonds are released. And I think after being true to who you are, then you can learn to have a healthy relationship with somebody else and, you know what, it's worth it. It's worth every bit of it, and I have a beautiful family. Three wonderful children and a wonderful wife. 

00:51:05
GERALYN CRAWFORD Tears that make you laugh, yeah. No, he's good, he's good. He's doing really good. Yeah. 

00:51:15
[music] 

00:51:15
DAVID LISAK I think the other really, really major part of reclaiming my life has been Claire. 

00:51:25
[music] 

00:51:25
CLAIRE HARWELL I think it's important for people who want to have an intimate relationship with someone who's had, particularly a childhood trauma, um, psychological trauma, to understand that, what's involved is to enter that journey with the person. It's, it's not simply to stand near them and be sympathetic and listen well. Um, it's, it's really a journey that you will undertake together. Um, and you have to be willing to walk with them through some of those dark times. 

00:52:05
[music] 

00:52:05
DAVID LISAK It's been possible to have a healthy relationship with Claire in part because of the healing, but in large part also because Claire's just a really healthy, stable person. And then through, through my relationship with Claire I've been able to experience myself differently and I've been able to experience just being alive differently. The more you are freed up to feel like you can be safe with another person and safe meaning that you can talk openly with another person. That you can express your feelings for another person and about another person. That you can go through conflicts with another person and it could be OK. You are developing a life with somebody else and having experiences, healthy experiences with somebody else. And that becomes, like, this other part of your life, now that is growing. And eventually those parts of your life become bigger and bigger and in proportion the wounds from the abuse or the trauma proportionally they become smaller. 

00:53:20
TONY RODGERS Definitely one of the places for people, for men and boys to go to, to get help and to also have like. Like I said I want the change to be sustainable. So, having some kind of structured program in place. 

00:53:30
DAVID LISAK I think we have to reach out to teenagers, um, and to, to young men in their early 20's, and in their mid 20's. Um, and we have to reach out to them in a very, very proactive way. You know, we can't just put up posters and think that they're gonna walk up to the poster and say, oh, OK, here's the phone number I call. 

00:53:50
TONY RODGERS My parents were, um, uncomfortable talking about it. I don't think they knew how to talk about it. And, um, I know now that I, if a child would talk to me about it, I know what to do and I know what the tools that I have in place. But I think, if a child talks to an adult about it, it's their responsibility to get help. 

00:54:15
MAN2 Men will tell their stories, we just have to make the space for them to tell it. 

00:54:20
[music] 

00:54:20
MAN4 Every day this healing happens when I, um, grab a piece of who I really am, as opposed to being what I think this person wants me to be. So the invisibility is starting to, uh, be filled in with a, me that's authentic. 

00:54:40
MARK CRAWFORD It doesn't bother me, it doesn't bother me anymore. And I think that's because over time you can heal. I, if, I've taken, instead of that controlling my life, I've taken my life back. And I recognize it for what it is, it was not something I did. So, I have, I don't have that shame. I've shed that shame the blame belongs there, not here, not here. 

00:55:05
TONY RODGERS Since I didn't understand it all at that age, I'd told myself that I would come back to me as a man, after I finished my, my group I walked to the beach that night and I talked to him. And I told him that it's OK, like I'm your father now. And I will protect you, I will love you, I will take care of you, I am responsible for you and you're safe with me and I embraced him. And not physically, but spiritually I embraced him and it was at that moment that I felt like I returned as one in my whole body. You know? 

00:55:45
DAVID LISAK Because of my own history I understand and, uh, I understand from the inside. And I understand that sometimes what separates us is, uh, is as thin as a thread. 

00:56:00
MARK CRAWFORD Men need to have hope, and when you have hope, you'll heal without a doubt.
