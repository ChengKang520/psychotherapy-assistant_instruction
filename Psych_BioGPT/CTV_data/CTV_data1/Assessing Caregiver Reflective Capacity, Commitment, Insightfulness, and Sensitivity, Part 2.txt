Assessing Caregiver Reflective Capacity, Commitment, Insightfulness, and Sensitivity 

00:00:00
DVD II 

00:00:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, I'm gonna talk a bit about sensitivity now. Sensitivity is very important in assessing parent capacity. Sensitivity is a bit of a complex construct. And it's really an amalgam of reflective function or reflective capacity, insightfulness and concordant inter subjectivity. Okay. Sensitivity really is an amalgam of those three constructs. It's difficult to be sensitive if I can't read you, if I can't have in my mind a representation of you and recognize that you might have different values, beliefs, thoughts, ideas, feelings, perceptions than I do. So obviously, reflective function is very important for sensitivity. Insightfulness, right. If I'm gonna be sensitive in my parenting, I have to have some degree of insightfulness into me as well as you, right. I have to have the ability, if I'm gonna be sensitive, for example, to recognize when I may have made a mistake, to recognize when you make have misperceived something, right, all of those things. And then, obviously, concordant inter subjectivity. I kind of skipped over that. I assume people knew what that meant, but I realize probably not. How many don't… How many are not really pretty familiar with inter subjectivity and what that is? Okay, couple of you. All right, bunch of you. Everybody is familiar with the construct attunement. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:01:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Correct? Anyone not know what attunement is? Okay, so you're all familiar with that. It's a… It's a construct we talk about a lot in this work, right. We want parents to be attuned to their child. We should be attuned to our clients, all of that stuff. Umm… And it's a great construct, except that in my experience, it's too limited because it only addresses one aspect of a relationship. Inter subjectivity in… in probably the most simple terms refers to shared emotion, which is what attunement is, right, shared emotion, shared attention and shared intention, those three elements. It's a richer construct. And then if you think about it, it really captures what goes on in the relationship, right. Ideally, we have some shared emotion. Mirror neurons are one way in which we develop empathy and share emotion, right. That's sort of the… the neurological substrate for empathy and shared emotion. Shared attention, right, we should be paying attention to similar things, and shared intention. It also gives you a way to analyze relationships and think about when something isn't working well, why isn't it working well. And then leads you to a way to think about how fixing it. So if some… So concordant inter subjectivity means that all three of those dimensions are in sync, right, concordant, in sync, three. And then disconcordant inter subjectivity would refer to the inter subjective sharing of experience when one or more of those dimensions is out of sync. Okay. So, sensitivity, being a sensitive parent, requires that you create interactions and relationships that are mostly concordant inter subjective experiences. Okay, where mostly you have concordant, shared inter subjective experiences okay. And then when they are not, you have to identify, this is where the reflective function comes in, and insightfulness, then you have to identify where is the disconnect. So that you can fix it, 'cause you know where the disconnect is and then you know how to fix it. For example, there is the example of parent and child playing a game, right. Umm… And how many of you have either had the experience or have parents talk to you about the experience? "I thought we were having a wonderful time. The next thing I know, he threw the board up in the air and stormed out of the room." Right. Sound familiar, either personally or you've…? Right, okay. So, you know, we can either look at that as this is a spoiled brat and that would lead you in one direction, probably not a good one, but it would lead… that could be a theory. I suggest if you think about that in terms of inter subjectivity, we can analyze the experience and then figure out what might have gone wrong. So, we look at it and we say, "We were playing a game. And we were both… seemed to be having fun. Okay." So, we've got shared emotion at that point, shared affect, attunement, right. "Seemed like we were having a good time." And shared attention, why, we're both focused on the game. But was the intention shared? You might have thought it was. You as the parent, or the parent you're working with, was playing the game to enjoy spending time with their child and do something that would be pleasurable. But it could be that the child's intention was primarily to win. That for that child, winning and losing dramatically effects their sense of self and losing to them means they are a bad kid. So, they don't want to lose. And it just so happened at that point in the game, when they threw the board up in the air, you just happened to be winning. Not that you were intending to win, but just, you know, you're having a good time and that's the way it goes. Now if that's true, right, if your analysis were true, now as a parent, that would lead you to a way to fix things. First we could go to the child. You could talk about that. You could apologize. You know, "I didn't realize that it was so important for you and, you know, I was just playing." Alternatively, or in addition, and, you might in the future make sure you pick games that aren't about winning and losing. So then you can have shared emotion, shared attention and shared intention. Okay. So… So, sensitivity requires all of those dimensions. This thing is a little dysregulated. If there is a therapist in the room, maybe… Okay. So… Umm… Can be… So it can be evaluated clinically and subjectively. Okay. I think I've covered this theory. The parents' ability to reflect on their own experience is part of sensitivity. Right, you have to be able to reflect on what's going on with the child, their capacity to engage. Yeah. So, I've really covered this. So, I want to talk about commitment, then I'm going to show you another video clip of something that I think demonstrates the parents', both commitment and sensitivity. Okay, both. Parent commitment, this comes from the commitment assessment. Not what you do to get someone in psychiatric hospital, but what you do to assist a parent's commitment to this child. It comes from Mary Dozier's work. And there's a reference cited in the reference list, you know, which I can give to you at some point. And it's based on nine questions. It's specific to a particular child. Okay, So, you would talk with the parent, one of the questions is, "I'd like to begin by asking you to describe your child. What is so and so's personality like?" Just want them to describe the child. "How much would you miss your child if your child had to leave?" And you want to hear what they describe. You know, talk toward the end, about how you analyze this or how you interpret their responses. But you want to hear them talk about that, okay. "How much would you miss?" We look… Again, what we're wanting to read is what's the parent, the caregiver's, emotional connection or commitment to this child. So, that's one measure of it. How much will they miss the child? You know, at one extreme you have, "Well, it's probably for the best." Versus, you know, "It would break my heart." Right, okay. "How do you think your relationship with this child is affecting your child right now?" Okay. The higher the level of commitment, the more you would expect the parent to be able to describe how the relationship today is very important for that child, right. Lack of commitment, you get answers that would reflect, it doesn't seem important from the parent's perspective. What do you want for your child in the future? You know, again, what are their goals. And then there are other questions. Again, you can get this out of the article, Mary Dozier's article, if you're interested. But the ratings are… they're not, you know, highly numerical, they're broad based. But example of high commitment would be the parent provides evidence of a strong emotional investment in the child and in parenting the child. "I'd miss the child." "It would break my heart." "I think this relationship's really been helpful. I've seen him make wonderful progress." "In the future, I think…" you know, okay, you can get the idea. Descriptions of the child and the parent-child relationship clearly reflect a strong connection on the parent's part with the child, connection on the parent's part with the child. Not, "Oh, I think my child loves me. Right. But I love my child." And the child is fully integrated into the family, like you heard with Joe in the clip I showed earlier. It was "my kids." "This is what I would want for my kids." Right, not Crystal and then my… my other kids. Low… Low commitment. The parent provides virtually no evidence of a strong and active emotional investment in the child or in parenting the child. Let me be clear. This isn't… Someone who has a low commitment is not a bad caregiver. Okay. It's just that their emotional investment in this child is minimal. They may provide perfect… you know, they may… clothing, shelter, take them to, you know, school. If they're interested in soccer, get them signed up for the local soccer team. And do all of those, you know, kinds of things to… to… to you know, recognize the kid likes certain cartoons and get those for the kid, whatever. But their emotional investment isn't there for one reason or another. And as I talked about it earlier, the longer someone's been a foster parent and the more children that have gone through their home, the lower their level of commit… by and large, the lower their level of commitment. Is there a question? Okay. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Is the, a parent or foster parent (inaudible ) (inaudible )? 

00:11:21
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Uh… Well, they might have low commitment. Or they might not. They may be really burned out and frustrated, but still have a high level of commitment. You know, for example then, the way they might describe this, you know, "I'm just really, you know, annoyed. Nothing's working. You know, I do my best for this kid. I really care about this kid. But, you know, she just has… she's not grateful. Okay. And she doesn't show, you know, and doesn't show me any affection back." But… But a piece of that is, you know, "I really care about this child and I love this child." So, you can have a parent who is feeling frustrated and burned out, but still have a high level of commitment. So these are… these are… I would describe your level of burnout and frustration, your level of commitment are two separate and not necessarily related. They could be, but not necessarily related constructs. Okay. That… That makes sense? Okay. Umm… The parent may be indifferent to whether the child remains in the parents care or not. And they may actually state that the parent hopes or desires the child will be removed. Not… Not "I want this kid in my house." But it could be as, "Oh, the best thing in the world would be for the child to go back to his or her birth family. Really hope that happens. Hope this child gets adopted some day by a really nice family." Okay. "How would you feel if they left?" "Oh, it would be the best thing for them and that would be… that would be good." Okay. That may be true, but what I'm not hearing is the, you know, another parent might say, you know, "I don't want to adopt this child. I can't, I'm too old but, you know, I kind of wish I could. I really love this kid. I know it would be best for them to be adopted but, you know, I'm gonna feel really sad when they leave." Okay. "I hope there's some way I can stay involved with them, maybe as a grandparent or godparent or something." Okay? So, that would evident some level of commitment. And there is little evidence that the parent would… well I described… I described that. Okay. So, that's the parent commitment assessment. And this you can do the interview itself, the nine questions, probably half hour, 45 minutes. It will give you a good reading of their assessment to a particular child. So it has to be with a particular child. It can't be just a general commitment. And it… it could be different for each child. So, somebody could have a high level of commitment to their birth child and a very low level of commitment to their foster child. Right. Wouldn't it make sense? If it's the 50th kid in their home over the last 10 years, but they have a birth child, right. That wouldn't… That wouldn't be surprising. So just, that's an important point. You don't make a global assessment of commitment, you're writing an assessment of this parents' commitment to this particular child at this point in time. Yes? 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:14:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good… Good question. So the question was… So we're working with a parent, a foster parent. We've made a placement. They really don't have a level of commitment to this child. They're not participating in the way we'd like in the therapeutic work. What do we do? Then… Then you have to make the very difficult clinical and evaluative decision. Is it better to keep them there? And can we help this parent to have more commitment and to be involved in the therapeutic process in a more helpful way? How long will that take? What's the damage we're inflicting by having the child in that home, in that kind of environment? On the one hand, and on the other hand, moving them to a new home, which is disruptive and disturbing and… and, you know, moving kids is not a good thing. You know, it's… I suppose it's the… the situation that maybe some physicians face on do we amputate this hand or not? Do we try antibiotics and hope it works? What do we do? It's not a good, this choice, but that's kind of what you're weighing off, you know. If you say, "Oh no, I think, you know, we can really help this parent. She can… She'll have more commitment and she'll participate actively. And we can do that, you know, in the near future." Well, that would be great then. You know, if you're saying, "I don't know, you know. I don't think she's ever going to feel good about this kid." Then I think I'd rather move the child to a placement where we think that can happen. Recognize that is hurtful to the child, that's disturbing. We would want to do everything we can to smooth that out, to help the new family recognize that this is gonna be difficult for the child and do what we can to, sort of, cushion that as best we can. But recognize that it's… we're inflicting hurt. So, be nice if there were an easy answer. I'm sorry there isn't. All right, we have a question here. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:16:16
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, okay. So the question is there have been many studies looking at the commitment of the person who adopts and then continues to foster. Again, I think what the research would say is the longer they've been a foster parent and more kids they've had, probably the lower their level of commitment to the foster child. And I think you would have the same situation whether it's a birth child or adopted child, that you could have a different level of commitment to this child, who's yours, whether it's by birth or adoption, versus the child who you are fostering. Okay. So, again that's why you have to do this assessment for the particular child with that parent. And you can't say, "Oh, she's really a committed parent. She's raised three wonderful kids." That's true. But that may have nothing to do with, as I say, this being her 10th anniversary as a foster parent and the 55th kid in her home. Okay. Uh… There was… Yes. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:17:11
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes. Oh, so then… then… one would be… so question is if you move them, one will be more negatively affected than the other. And that's a good example where it may be… it may make sense to split up siblings. I don't feel, personally, that umm… it's always the right decision to always keep siblings together. I think that relationships are extremely complex. You know, be nice if there were simple answers, and… and bright white lines in things that we always did. But I think each situation is different, and often it can be very helpful to keep siblings together. And there are other times you can be creating a disaster. And each situation is different, because you've got siblings, you've got their relationship with each other. You've got their own trauma history, which each ones… even though they were in the same home, each one is different. First kid, second kid, boy, girl, etcetera, in this family, all of the relationships… it's very complicated. And they're… you know. Again, in child welfare system, we have policies. But policies don't address the fact that these are complex situations. And the answer is should we keep siblings together? It depends. That's the answer. So, that may be a situation where it is in fact best to separate the siblings. Any other… Yes. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:18:36
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah. Well, you can… he was saying that some of the research shows that you… you get descriptions of the family from two siblings, and it is as if they're describing two completely different families. Yes, to… to a lesser extent that's probably true if you have brothers or sisters and you reflect on what it was like growing up. You often… I know in… like my wife's family, when you hear her talk about the family, and her dad, and her mom, and what happened, it's a very different picture. Not very different, but it's pretty different than her brothers', her two older brothers. Because they had a different experience with their mom and with their dad than she did. Why? Because she was the third, they are the first and second. They're boy… I mean, a whole range of reasons. But that… yeah. And then when you have a trauma history on top of that, you sometimes get even more dramatic differences. So… And again… again, reminded me, I remember… like, when I was growing up, my mother, I was the first born, actually still am the first born, I guess. She is done having the kids. I'm the first born. She… She always… well, when I was really young, I guess, I could have… Anyway, never mind. Anyway, she always described me as the smart one. And my younger brother as the hard worker, "Danny works hard." And I remember when he graduated MIT in engineering, and then was going to work on a doctorate at University of Maryland in physics, I'm saying to my mom, "Boy, Danny is so bright. What a smart guy he is." And she says, "Yeah, he really works hard. He's really a hard worker." You know this is… these were the roles, smart, hard worker. So… So yeah, that… we see that in… in any family. Other questions? No? Okay, okay. Alright, before I discuss the adult attachment interview, I want to show you this video clip. Umm… It's a bit of a long… it's about a 15-minute clip. So, it's a little long because the part I want to show you, sort of in the middle. But… Mom… Mom and dad adopted this boy. He was adopted from Russia when he was 10. Is that right? Ten or eleven… He's about 13 or 14 here. Umm… and you'll see the mom really exhibits, umm… you can… you can hear and see the commitment. You can hear and see the sensitivity. 

00:21:15
SERGEI Mom! 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:21:20
SERGEI We need you in here. 

00:21:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And your brother… 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:21:25
SERGEI I'll hold my brother. Can I hold him, Mom? 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Umm… You might not want to right now. Have you not heard him? 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:21:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is the light bothering him or… 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN I… He has never done this. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN You have no idea. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Poor kid's screaming with anger. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN He won't feed. If he's tired, he would have fallen asleep right now. He hasn't cried very long. He stopped when I started walking with him. I don't know what's going on. 

00:21:50
(inaudible). 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN He's gonna scream. 

00:22:00
SERGEI I don't know for sure. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:22:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Start bouncing him (inaudible ). 

00:22:12
UNKNOWN I've been doing everything I can. He just screams. 

00:22:15
(inaudible). 

00:22:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Start bouncing your legs a bit. More, more, more bounce. Yeah, there you go. See, she likes that. See? 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN I asked my mom, they wanted to come, and they said no. They didn't think it would be helpful. Now, I'm really wishing that they had come because… Sweetheart, honey… I have never seen him so angry, screaming like he was in the other room. Looks like he likes that, he's starving. 'cause he was interrupted when we came here, he only ate five minutes, but I don't know if he's not eating 'cause he's too upset. 

00:23:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That could be. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN To take it. 

00:23:20
SERGEI You've got the brotherly touch. I'll… I'll leave you alone. But if need me to walk him then just… 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Thank you, that's really sweet. 

00:23:30
SERGEI I'm sorry. 

00:23:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN May be he's just quiet because they're just unhappy or not feeling great. Look at that. 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN It's working. 

00:23:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, we were just beginning to talk about, umm… kind of where we should go from here. Should we meet in a month or two, early, but open to whatever and… So I said… kind of talked about it. Let's say it's gonna work best for everybody. References on that regard. It does sound like things are going reasonably well at home and a lot better than when we first started meeting. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Definitely. 

00:24:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN We're just talking about and he… he wants to spend time with you and John and Thor. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I mean, that, you know, that would make him mad if you made come from his friends. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN He has definitely changed a lot. 

00:24:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) He has definitely changed a lot. 

00:24:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Was it going well? Talk a little about may be trying to make some more friends, you know, makes friends at school by inviting them all along to coming… 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Not just acquaintances but, you know, it was not just… 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Friends. 

00:24:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Not just people that you know, but friends, where you sort of like to spend time together. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Hang out with them. 

00:24:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah. First and just you and John, first about what would and wouldn't work, and then let's diagnose, he figures that out, then he can talk to the kid. At first you talk to the parents, you see what works. And then you talk to the kid. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN The boy that he had said was his favorite boy, I think, now he's decided he isn't, because he mentioned to me that some other boys at school and this one in particular, were… His eyes are closed. I think he's gonna fall asleep. Umm… making inappropriate jokes, and making Sergei uncomfortable. And… And doing this all the time, like, turning everything into an inappropriate joke and… 

00:25:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is this Chris, the kid…? 

00:25:35
SERGEI No. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN This was the boy he mentioned last time, Michael. 

00:25:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. Okay, yeah, he never talked about a boy Chris who was a little bit concern. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, okay. I don't think you told me about Chris. 

00:25:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN 'Cause that's the other thing. Probably if he's gonna invite some of his friends, it's probably better they be, like, really more sack as opposed to a lot toward him. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, not an hour away. 

00:25:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN I should have brought (inaudible ). Hand the baby to Sergei when the baby is upset. He will take care of him. 

00:26:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So… So, what do you think would, like you have thoughts or feeling Sergei or do (inaudible ). What would be most helpful for the… for the two of you? 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN At this point, I feel like, for myself anyway, you have taught… you've taught John and I everything that we need to know to parent Sergei effectively. 

00:26:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm… 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN And, umm… when we make mistakes and we do things wrong and when we blow it, it's because we didn't do what you told us to do. 

00:26:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And you, kind of, know it too, so you stop… 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, we know what we did wrong. 

00:26:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes, like, you were puzzled about what you did. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN We have the… the awareness and the insight now because we have come… so that, yes, when we have done something wrong, we know what we have done wrong. And we know… we know how to fix it. I guess, the only reason why I would see continuing at this point is, for myself anyway, is for someone to keep me on track and to keep me focused and to keep me in the right frame of mind. And not flip back. And I don't know about Sergei. 

00:27:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, what are you thinking? 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Do you feel different now than when you first started coming? 

00:27:40
SERGEI Much, much different. 

00:27:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So how would you describe it? How would you describe the Sergei today compared to the… 

00:27:45
SERGEI More free. 

00:27:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN More free. Oh, what do you mean? 

00:27:50
SERGEI Now… what's the word? I don't… When I think about my past, I think… I think I was in the good way. 

00:28:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. So how like… So how do you think about all those things in a good way? 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
SERGEI At times, I think about past as… I think, it's not something good. I doesn't come to my mind, like when I… I was hungry those days. When that come from… If I ever think about that, I don't feel sad. I feel… I feel… I feel like more better about it. 

00:28:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So when you think about those things, like you were hungry or people are mean, you mean like it just doesn't upset you or bother you as much as it used to? 

00:28:50
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:28:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You can think about it without getting, like, really angry or really sad as you, kind of, used to get really sad about it. 

00:28:55
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:28:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. 'Cause that's what it means to come to terms with something. 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN I know you had said, when the baby first came, that watching us take care of him and love him made you sad because… 

00:29:10
SERGEI Yes. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN No one did that for you. Does it still make you sad when you see us taking care of the baby and the baby being loved? 

00:29:20
SERGEI I just started to pretend the baby is me. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:29:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is that right. And so when you do that what's that like? 

00:29:30
SERGEI I don't feel so bad about it. Okay, okay. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN What do you want, his head to go down further? Yes. 

00:29:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Because that's. Had you been born to your mom and dad, everything you see and doing or, really all the things that they would have done for you. 

00:29:50
SERGEI Yeah. He looks like I'm… I think that he looks a lot like me when I was a little baby. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Just like he loves looking at Sergei's face. 

00:30:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ). 

00:30:06
UNKNOWN He really likes Sergei. Obviously, look at this. 

00:30:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It's great. It's so nice. 

00:30:15
SERGEI I think I'm doing better, but I think I need… I'm nobody, when I moving down to hill because I think the future about… feel more… more sad when I see they took care of baby because… I feel… I feel better about it now perfectly. So I think I've, in the months that I've been, a month and a half or two months. 

00:30:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. So may be look at setting something up, like, after the first year, like, six weeks or so away. Six weeks away? Yeah, you can do that. 

00:30:50
SERGEI Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN I'm curious if it helps to imagine that the baby is you? 

00:30:55
SERGEI It does. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN It does? 

00:31:00
SERGEI It does, but a lot… I still… I feel sad. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN Simple fact that you didn't get it. 

00:31:10
SERGEI And sometimes I feel sad 'cause I wish I was him. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Sure. Well, there's some… may be not, but I sort of feel like sometimes you and John, sort of, wish Sergei was, I mean, you had a chance to… 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN I wish I could've had Sergei when he was a baby, yeah, from the very beginning, very much so. 

00:31:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It would have been so different for everybody. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN 'Cause I feel like those years of his life were robbed from me. And he wouldn't be taken care of by someone who wasn't even taking care of him. And I would have loved him, and cuddled him and enjoyed him, and done all those things and I didn't get to do that. And the person who had him, could have done that and didn't. So they didn't deserve to have him. 

00:32:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Everybody missing. You missed out on doing that… 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And he missed out on having that. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 'Cause it's so fun to be able to do that for just by it. So special to be able to nurse him and to hold him and cuddle him, because baby's cuddle you like kids when they get older don't. You know, even, when he is two, he won't do that anymore, or even one. 

00:32:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, right. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN It's just a very special time, and yeah, I feel robbed that I didn't get to have that with Sergei. 

00:32:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It is… it is sad that you didn't have that, Sergei, when (inaudible ). 

00:32:30
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:32:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And you couldn't have… (inaudible ) his age, 'cause what Jesiah has everybody should have. And it's sad that you couldn't have that with your mom. So that is exactly what she would have done had you been born to her or had she gotten you right when you were born. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I feel like his Russian mom didn't realize how precious… what she had was, you know. That… That her child, Sergei, from the time he was a baby, all the way you know was something very, very, very precious that she should have treasured and … 

00:33:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN So, I wish I could have done that. 

00:33:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What I find so interesting is that and you just said you missed that and your mom couldn't do that. What I always, I guess find so interesting is that despite of all that, you know, despite that that didn't happen and it should have, that somehow things are hinting to work out well for you, that somehow you're able to get past that and you're able to have a relationship with your mom and your dad, and your brother. And you're able to feel better, and you're certainly able… much more able to, you know, talk about what you're feeling and to tell your mom what you're thinking and feeling and, all that. And it's such a big change. 

00:34:10
SERGEI Mm-hmm… 

00:34:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I like that… so you say, I mean, you feel freer. I like that word. It's a nice way to describe it. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, he can still enjoy a… a beautiful today and a beautiful tomorrow, even though yesterday wasn't beautiful. You know, even though there were some things in his past that were ugly, umm… he can still experience the beauty of today and tomorrow. He can still experience love and good relationships and… 

00:34:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:45
SERGEI I wish (inaudible ) 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN There was, umm… one difficult evening we had, I'm just remembering in this past month that we didn't mention. And I was taking Sergei to the youth group, remember? And the baby was crying 'cause he was hungry. Well, I don't know if he was hungry or tired, but he was just screaming. And I said if he doesn't stop crying in five minutes, I'm gonna pull over the car and nurse him. Because we had a 20-minute drive and I said, we're not gonna let him scream for 20 minutes. So that was really upsetting to Sergei 'cause he wanted to get to youth group, he didn't want to be late and… So that made him angry at Jesiah. Though I still you know. I'm just thinking, right. Umm… And he made some comments like, "Jesiah is not even my real brother." And, "I don't even love him," and you know, some… dome comments like that. And so I told him, I said Jesiah is just as much as your brother as I am your mom. You know, just as adoption made you my son, adoption has also made you his brother. 

00:35:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN So I don't know if there is any of those lingering issues that are still left or not. But… 

00:36:00
SERGEI I was just really angry and I wasn't thinking what I said. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Were you saying things you didn't mean because you're angry or were you saying things that you've been hiding inside? Sometimes when we're angry, we say things that are not true, or either say that true that we've been hiding. 

00:36:15
SERGEI Alright. I don't even think about that, like, he's not my brother. I was just angry. 

00:36:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So you were… I don't know if this is… and if this is true. So were you looking to say something that you thought would be hurtful? You know what I mean? Sometimes when you're angry, you want to be angry, so you want to do something that's, like, getting at them or be hurtful or whatever, because you're mad. 

00:36:50
SERGEI I think so. 

00:36:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is that what you were trying to do? Okay. It's okay, sometimes people do that. They're angry so they want to… if I may ask they want to hurt the person, so they say something, you know… I can see why that… you know, it was kind of a hurtful thing to say. So how did you… how did you resolve it afterwards? 

00:37:10
SERGEI I said sorry, I really do. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN After youth group, he told me sorry, which I really wasn't sure you said… why you said sorry to me because you hadn't done anything to me. 

00:37:25
SERGEI Sorry… 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN I guess you were… I guess, you were sorry that you said… 

00:37:30
SERGEI Oh, you think he knows? 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN No, you didn't forget. 

00:37:35
SERGEI Come on. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN No, how are you gonna get happy now? 

00:37:40
SERGEI Mom. 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN Sometimes it leaks through, but not usually. 

00:37:45
SERGEI Mom. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN But there will be more. 

00:37:55
SERGEI Mom, you take him. 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN That's okay. But he said during youth group he felt bad that night about what he had said. So I think when he said sorry to me, umm… I think your meaning, you were saying, "I'm sorry. I regret saying that." That's probably what you had to say, right? "I wish I had not said that." 

00:38:15
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN "Because it wasn't true." Is that why you regretted that you said it? That was how you really felt? It did make me sad when he said it, because I… 

00:38:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I can see why… 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Sergei would say sorry to you, because I could see why that would hurt you that your one son says to you that the other one's not… 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, me too. He's probably gonna start crying again. You're mad at me for something. You're mad at me. He says, "You keep sticking that nipple in my mouth, no matter what it is." Honey… 

00:38:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN He feels so hot. I wonder if he's over-heated. Yeah, you want to get out of it. Yeah, it was… it made me sad because I want them both to love each other very much. You know, I want them to have a really special relationship. And I think they can have a really special relationship, if Sergei wants that. I know Jesiah would want that, 'cause he's just gonna be this little boy who idolizes his big brother and, you know… 

00:39:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Absolutely, Sergei is gonna be his big brother. 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN So yeah, he'll think Sergei is the coolest, so it really just depends whether Sergei wants, you know, wants to be… have a close relationship with him. 

00:39:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I was thinking, might be interesting, it occurred to me, because… I mean, I know over time you'll gradually have less and less of an accent. But I guess that for a fairly long time you'll have a little bit of one. And it occurred to me that your brother might have actually start picking up… 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN A Russian accent off of him? 

00:39:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, 'cause that's how his brother talks. 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN That would be so cool. I would love that. I don't want Sergei to lose his accent. I like his accent. I wouldn't mind if you had a Russian accent, too. I would like Sergei to teach him Russian. 

00:40:10
SERGEI I'll have a job. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Huh? 

00:40:10
SERGEI I'll have a job. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Oh. I mean right now, in the next two years when he's learns to talk. 

00:40:15
SERGEI So when they're talking to me, let's say… 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN That's true. Actually, I shouldn't push this stuff on that, functionally. 

00:40:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN He'll make… The question, I think, yeah, your mom may pick up. On the other hand, it could be then a secret language for you and your brother. So when you two want to say something that your mom and dad don't… you don't want you mom and dad to know, you can talk to each other without them knowing… 

00:40:35
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. I don't think I like this. Never mind. May be don't do that. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN I would like to ask Sergei to help me out in making time together a priority. Would you be willing to do that? 

00:41:00
SERGEI Yeah. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Help me remember to do it. Help me plan it. Help me… you know, let's work together on that. Because I really like the special day we had together. I really, really, really enjoyed it. And I think we need to have time like that regularly. So if you can help just remember, like, to do your special time every evening, and… 

00:41:25
SERGEI We can pursue with that. 

00:41:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, let me talk a little bit about the Adult Attachment Interview then. Okay. Umm… Again, if you're going to use this for clinical purposes, umm… what I would do is get that book, "Clinical Applications of the Adult Attachment Interview" edited by Steele and Steele, Miriam, umm… I think is one of them. And it's at Guilford Press, this year or last year, New York, and includes a lot of good research. It describes different uses of the Adult Attachment Interview. Originally, it was developed as a research tool to measure, uh… adult's state of mind with respect to attachment. Okay. That's how it was developed. Umm… and so as a research tool, of course, you would want people to be using it in a very standardized sort of way. So that it is a very elaborate training program you would go through, if you want to use it for research. So that basically, if you code it one way and you code it one way, and I code an interview, we'd know that we'd all come up with the same conclusion. There's been a recognition over the years that it's a very rich tool for evoking, sort of the… the unconscious. It's a very rich tool for bringing forth a person's state of mind with respect to attachment. And it has a lot of good clinical uses, both in assessment, but also in treatment. Okay. And so the book describes a lot of that. The interview itself, the protocol is about 18 or 20 specific questions that you ask. The interview itself takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half to administer, depending on how, you know, chatty the person is. Umm… You can either audiotape it or videotape. I prefer to videotape it so I can, kind of, watch and listen. And let me go through the questions first then I'll talk a little bit about how you would think about it. You usually start out very, kind of, innocuously, like this. To begin with, could you tell… could you help me to get a bit of orientation to your family? So you want the person to just tell you about the family. You kind of see what they have to say. And you want to find out who raised them. Okay. You know, was it their mother and father, was it a grandmother and aunt? Who was it who raised them? Okay. And you need to find that out because that has to… that influences some later parts of the interview. And then you ask them to describe their relationship with their parents or grandparent, aunt, uncle, whoever raised them. As a young child starting as far back as you can remember. Again, just sort of a general question to see what they come up with. The heart of the interview was this last part. And maybe if the other tape will work, I'll show you a video clip of that where you ask the person, "Can you give me five adjectives or phrases to describe your relationship with…" And again, you might start with mother, than to father, aunt, uncle. You know, whatever, whoever raised them. The key point is you want adjectives or phrases that describe the relationship, not the person. Okay. So not, "She was nice, she was tall. He was fat," you know. "He played soccer." But what was the relationship like? Okay. And you say to the person, you know, as you… as you give me these five, take your time, I'll them down in the… the interview manual which is online. If you just Google Adult Attachment Interview, you can actually get the… the interview protocol and you can download that. Okay. And that protocol gives you all of the questions, all of the probes, describes a little bit what you're trying to do. So, it's a useful… useful tool to have. Then what we do is after they've given you the five adjectives and you've written them down, then you go back and you say, "Okay, you said your relationship with your mother was loving. Can you give me a specific memory from the pre-teen years that exemplifies loving?" And that's where you're looking for, is a memory that's specific, okay. So, the person might say, "Oh, you know, he was always there for me." And the probe might be some like, "Well, that's a good general description, but you can you give me a specific memory that would exemplify why you pick loving to describe your relationship with your dad?" You know. "Oh, yeah, now I remember. You know, we had a puppy and it died. And he came into my room…" and blah, blah. Okay, that might be a specific example. And you go through each of the five adjectives. Then you go back. If there's another person who is responsible for raising them, get five adjectives and, you know, you do the same thing. Okay. And then the other question, you ask about what the person did when they were hurt, when their feelings were hurt, when they were physically hurt, when they were scared. Other than… there are a whole bunch of other questions. Did they ever do anything to frighten you? There're some questions that ask about the future. If you have kids, what's your hope for them? If you don't, what do you think it would be? So there are a whole bunch of questions. It's a really very, very, very rich clinical tool. As I mentioned earlier, you can… you can use these questions and then use your clinical judgment to make sense out of the answers. So, whatever your perspective is, you can get a lot of material from it and use it. And it's very useful. It's interesting, when I was in Singapore and I was doing a five-day training program there. And we spent a lot more time on this piece. And we had people practicing it. And one of the psychologists in the group, umm… because I wanted to demonstrate it, I said, "Okay, I'll do this part of it. Can I have a volunteer?" She came forward. I said, "Do you want to pretend you are a client?" She said, "No, I'll just answer it for myself." Which was fine. And the day before we discussed all of this, we probably spent about half a day discussing the Adult Attachment Interview and what the questions were, and what it meant, and how it's used it and all of that. We went through it. She answered it, the different questions and all of that. Then afterwards which she reflected on it, what I thought was really fascinating, she said, "You know, I had no idea how evocative and in some ways upsetting, but in some ways, I just… things I'd never thought about that got evoked by this. By your… I mean, I knew the questions you were going to ask. And I know why, and I knew all of that. But when you were asking the questions and I had to give answers, it just brought forth all kinds of stuff I just hadn't thought about." It's really quite an amazing instrument in that regard. So, the interview, you inquire about, again, how the caregivers responded to them when they were upset. Did they ever feel threatened or rejected? What's their explanation for the caregiver's behavior? So you're asking about all of this stuff. And you're a value… again, you can… you can use your clinical judgment and interpret the answers within your own framework if you want. But if you want to look… use this as a tool to assess a person's state of mind with respect to attachment, then what you want to interpret is not the content. Okay. This instrument is not used to get content, although it does get content. What you assess is the manner in which they answer the questions. It's about process not content. It's about the nature and quality of their answers, not the content, okay. So, what you're looking at is first one dimension is coherence. And that refers to answers that provide clear and convincing descriptions, that are truthful, succinct and complete, and presented in a clear and orderly manner. Okay. Answer should be coherent. So, an example of an answer that isn't coherent would be, umm… And you've probably have had this experience. So, umm… "When you were young, pre-teen years, well, what was it like in your family growing up?" "It was normal." "Okay, well in what way?" "Oh, it was… it was good." "Well, what was good about it?" "It was regular." Okay? So first of all, that's not a clear and convincing description. They're giving me words. And I know what the words mean, and they know what the words mean. But there's no evidence. So, it's not clear and convincing. Maybe it's truthful. It's overly… it's… it's too succinct. It's certainly not complete. Okay. So maybe it's a succinct, but it's not… not complete. And it's not presented in a clear and orderly manner. So, that would be an example of an answer that is not coherent. And the second dimension is the ability to reflect on the motives of others. The "Why did this stuff happen?" Essentially, you're looking at five aspects to the process. And in fact, you can think about all discourse, all dialogue, all discussions. Umm… You can analyze them along these five dimensions. The first is quality, right. A good answer should be high in quality, meaning it's truthful and there should be evidence for what is said. Okay. Or quantity, in terms of the response can be evaluated in terms of quantity. It should be succinct and complete. Okay. The contribution should be as informative as is required, but no more so. So an example, again, of… of an answer that wouldn't fit that quality… Sometimes I'll say to parents in interview, "Could you give me a thumbnail sketch of where your child's lived from the time they were born until they came to your home? And just a little bit about why they moved." And they describe that. And… And still 15 minutes into the description, they're bouncing all over the place, between when they lived with the birth mom to the second foster home, or with… then they went back here. And that's… that's not an example of an answer that would be certainly quantity is way too much. What you're really asking for is, you know, just a kind of quick summary, a thumbnail sketch. Relevant… 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN What if they don't know? 

00:52:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's that? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Sometimes…. 

00:52:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Now, but you can… but you can give a coherent, complete, succinct answer to that, which is "I don't know where the person lived. I don't know where my child lived before they were seven. But I know that they lived in the Joneses before me, and they were there five years and then they came to my home." That's a complete, succinct answer. It's complete and succinct. Okay. So, again it's not about the content. It's about the manner in which the content is delivered. Relevant, the material should be relevant to the question, right. We've all had people… you say, "So tell me about what was your life growing up like?" And they start out talking about, "Oh, my mother and I were very close. And my dad and I did this. And I remember I got my tricycle and I… it was a red tricycle. And I love red. Red is such a pretty color. In fact, I painted my living room red, because it matched the dining room table that my husband got from his grandmother who lived till she was 90. It was terrible, she died of cancer. It was just awful," right. It's interesting. And you can see the connections. It's not, you know, flight of ideas. But it's not relevant to the question. Okay. And manner, be clear and orderly, avoid obscurity, avoid ambiguity. Be brief and orderly in discourse. So these are the four dimensions of discourse that you would… could evaluate any discussion around. And you evaluate the answers for the AAI around. So with the… as I said, the Adult Attachment Interview, uh… you probably want to give yourself about an hour and a half to do that. And again, you want… you are listening to… you're really listening to the process more than the content. So someone could have had a significant trauma and abuse history. Okay. Been through the child welfare system because they were abused, removed from their parents, either just stayed in foster care or adopted. But still give evidence of a secure pattern of attachment, because their answers were truthful. They have evidence for them. They can give complete and succinct answers. They can describe. Again, in their answers to the question, describe your relationship, say, with your mother, right. They might pick adjectives like, "It was frightening. It was disturbing, you know, it was hurtful." Okay. They could pick adjectives like that. Maybe it was fun, right. And then they could give you evidence of that. "Well, why was it fun?" "You know, I can remember on a birthday, my mom took me to this amusement park." Okay, good. "Why was it hurtful?" "Well, I remember when I was six and I don't remember what I did. But she got so angry she threw me down a flight of stairs." Okay. That's a disturbing memory. But in fact, that is a coherent memory. And if you look at the… it's truthful, she has evidence for what she's saying. It's succinct and complete. It's relevant, clear and orderly. Okay? So again, it's not content we're valuing, it's process. Okay. Actually in the… in research literature, the technical name for that, if someone has a significant trauma history, is "earned secure". The theory being that probably they had some insecure pattern of attachment, and because of some relationship, either psychotherapy or a relationship with someone important in their life, they've now developed a secure. So, they call it earned secure. But nonetheless, it's a secure pattern. So again, it's not the content that you're looking at, it is… it is how they describe the content. Okay. Umm… Any questions then about the Adult Attachment Interview before I, kind of, move… move on. Yes? 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Can you describe what is basic opinion on that doesn't really get content. Tell us about that. 

00:56:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, the basic idea, if they're… if they're… if they lack coherence when they're describing an event or answering a question, that reflects some degree of emotional upset around the content. So, that's… that's what it… what it tells you. And then what you're looking for, overall what you're looking for is, you know, if they can answer the… the questions as I've, you know, with high quality answers, the right quantity, it's relevant in the appropriate manner, that would be secure. People who go on and on, right, might be preoccupied. So they, you know, they… when they give an answer, they include lots of additional material, okay. Some of it relevant, some of it not relevant, especially around stuff that has emotional… content to it. People who're dismissing, are the ones who say, "Well, I don't really remember much before I was a teenager," were, you know, good. But again, throughout the entire interview you see that. The disorganized type, they are when they… too bad I can't show that clip because you see that with this fellow, they gave either really, sometimes weird answers that don't quite make sense. Long pauses, you know, long meaning, like, you know, 10 seconds is a long time to be quiet. Long pauses where they'll begin talking about, for example, like he does, unfortunately I cannot show it, but he does, talking about a dead relative as if… as if they're still alive. Okay. Odd use of words, sometimes people begin… they might talk about a dead relative. But then the quality they're doing, it's almost like they're… they're giving you a eulogy, right. Those would be all the examples of what you might see in the disorganized pattern, okay. So, that's kind of what you're looking at. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN So you're looking at cohesive narrative, similar to what you're looking for in your child, you know, that you're working with towards the end of treatment, and they're able to (inaudible ). 

00:58:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN All right, a coherent… cohesive narrative, yeah. Yeah, exactly. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Cohesive or coherent? 

00:58:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, both… both. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:58:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, other… other questions and about the adult… Again, I encourage you, download the protocol. So you know what the questions are and what the purpose is and what the probes are. And get the book, "Clinical Applications of the Adult Attachment Interview." But it's a wonderful tool. I have recommended to several child welfare systems that in the recruitment of foster parents… Not, I'm sorry, not the recruitment. After you've recruited foster parents, and you've done all your criminal background record checks and you've done the home study. And they've taken all the required training, you know, like in New York City, they have to take map and GPS, and all this other stuff. Once all that's occurred, before you certify them, you have somebody administer the Adult Attachment Interview, not to rule them out. Okay. It's not to say you can't be it. But it's so we do… we can do better matching of, umm… of children and parents. Because like you saw from Mary Dozier's work, with children who have significant disorders of attachment and trauma, you want a parent who has a secure pattern of attachment. That should be about 60%, 50%-60% of the foster families that you recruit, okay. But for other kids, for example, you have a child who is medically fragile, and that's really the primary issue, it may be less important that they have a secure… They may do fine with, you know, someone who has a preoccupied or avoidant pattern. Okay. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:00:36
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, if you want to do it for research purposes, you can go online. You have to… it's a two-week training program. You have to record at least 30, you know, transcripts and get them scored. If you're using it clinically, again, you would use your… You would get the… you would get the manual off the internet, so you know the questions. You'd get the book to read. You'd be using it… You'd be using the questions to evoke material that you'd use your own clinical judgment around, okay. That's different. You wouldn't then, for instance, what you wouldn't do is after doing this for two years, say, "Oh, look at this. I've got 40 cases. And I'm going to write an article describing their patterns of attachment and what happened," okay. Because we don't really know whether your assessment would… would… is valid or not. But if you're using it clinically, that's a different story. You're probably going to use it… When you do the assessments for research purposes, they're really more than the four categories. Within each one, they're usually three or four subcategories. So it's very… it's very precise. You're not really gonna be using it that way in a… in a… from a clinical point of view. So, what you're going to see, Chris, that's his name, is I'm just going to… You're gonna see the part where I ask him to come up… I think I do a little bit of interviewing before that, but I just ask him to come up with the five adjectives and then give me examples or evidence of them. So now I was doing… just to give you a little more background… I was doing this as part of a termination of parental rights evaluation. So, it's part of that, besides doing the insightfulness assessment with the foster parent and the child. 

01:02:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:02:21
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Huh? 

01:02:21
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:02:23
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

01:02:23
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:02:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Besides, doing the insightfulness assessment with the foster parent and the child, then I did the adult attachment interview with the foster mother, and the biological mother, and the biological father. And why? Because you know, when I went to court what I want to be able to do is first talk about this child's psychological and mental status and what did she need. What was the foster mother's capacity to meet those needs and what was the basis of my thinking that and what was the birth parents' capacity to provide the kind of environment that this child needed. So, then the court could make its decision about reunification or termination of parental rights and adoption. Okay. So that's, that's the… That was the background for why he showed up. 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN Did you do that assessment with the foster parent and the child, can you also do with the biological parent and the… 

01:03:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, actually, yeah. I would have ordinarily except that because this child was so traumatized by these parents. And it was such… she would, you know, she… she'd wet herself. She'd soil herself when she had any contact with them. I just… I just felt I couldn't… even though it would have been good information, I just felt I couldn't ask to have that happen, to put the child… 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:03:47
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes. 

01:03:47
UNKNOWN Those two relationships had it not been mapped… 

01:03:47
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, absolutely. Yeah, had it not been mapped traumatic and traumatizing, I would. But I just felt that I couldn't ethically subject a child to that kind of things. So, I kind of did the best I could about working around it. Okay. And at this point, I believe she had been out of the home for about a year. And… And the birth parents didn't want to voluntarily, you know, surrender. So, that's where they were going through the TPR process. Your… Your parents, how would you describe your relationship with your parents as a young child? Maybe going back as far as you can remember. But how would you describe that relationship? 

01:04:35
CHRIS My mother does this. But when I was… when I was with her or when I would visit her, she would make me feel really at home. And she would make me feel like family with my stepfather, with her new husband, my… her new husband would make me feel like family. And… I guess being that young, I really didn't know so much, so I guess I had to just take things as they are. Take things as they were, rather, and go from there. 

01:05:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And your father? How would you describe your relationship with him? 

01:05:20
CHRIS Good. I'd describe it as a good relationship. Even up till now it's good. He gave me money, if I ever needed money, he gave me some. I hardly ever need money now, so… Our relationship was more based upon our past experiences, like when we went fishing, I caught a fish. He never caught nothing. I was the only one that caught something on the whole trip. I caught a northern pike, and my friend was with me. He took me and my friend fishing in the hanging around us. Like, you know, he would take me to do things, to the movies. He would let me go roller skating on the weekends. He would always be at all my hockey games. He would never miss a hockey game or a practice. My grandfather, before he passed away, would always make my hockey game. Umm… But I think our relationship now is good. I keep in touch. I call him at least once a week. He doesn't live too far from me. That's good. 

01:06:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. Good. You know what I would like to ask you to do, it's to choose five words that reflect or describe your relationship with your mother, going back as far as you can. I would like you mainly to think about the pre-teen years. Say, from age five to 12. So as you pick each word, I'm gonna write each one down. But, I would like you to pick five words to describe, not… not to describe your mother. But five words that describe your relationship with your mother before you were 12. 

01:07:05
CHRIS Pleasant… Umm… Pleasant… umm… Promising. Umm… loving, caring… and fun. 

01:07:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. Okay. I want to go through some more questions, some more descriptions of your childhood relationship with your mother. You say your relationship with her was pleasant. Are there any specific memories or incidents that come to mind with respect to pleasant? A specific memory or incident that will characterize pleasant? 

01:08:15
CHRIS Like, one day she took me to the beach. And she let me do what I wanted to do on the beach for the whole day. All I wanted to do was lay under the Sun. And I got to do that. And laying out in the sun was very… very nice. So, I got real dark tan on that day. And I had to be like eight-years-old. And I didn't want anything to do with the pool. I just wanted to go there on the beach and go swimming. She was at Florida. So going to the beach at Florida is fun. I guess she's never been there. 

01:08:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Let's see. You say your relationship with her was promising. Are there any memories or incidents that come to mind with respect to promising? 

01:09:10
CHRIS I don't know. Umm… I at least get to see her once a year or once every two years. So I always be promised to see her. And I always did, I always seen her. 

01:09:25
[sil.] 

01:09:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm… Do you… You say your relationship with your mother was loving. Are there any specific memories or incidents that come to mind with respect to living? 

01:09:50
CHRIS Living or loving? 

01:09:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Uh… Sorry, loving. 

01:09:50
CHRIS Loving. Respect for loving… She, uh… will tell me she loves me. And then I tell her I love her. And usually, umm… we do something to express our feelings for each other, like kiss, or a hug, or cry together or what not, and… 

01:10:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Can you think of a specific memory that would, sort of, characterize that? 

01:10:25
CHRIS Umm… 

01:10:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN May be a specific memory to illustrate how the relationship was loving? 

01:10:30
CHRIS Yeah, umm… She will be at the airport and sending me home. And I'll be on the plane and she'll be taking pictures of the plane leaving, hoping she will catch me in it. And on my way on to the plane, she would be in tears, crying. And then when I get on the plane, I'm in tears that the plane is pulling away. So, I guess that's a loving relation. 

01:10:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. And… caring, you used that to describe your relationship with her. Are there any memories or incidents that would illustrate why you chose caring? 

01:11:05
CHRIS Yeah. She would care about my feelings at home with my stepmother. And how they would differ from her. And how my feelings from my stepmother would differ from my stepmother, from my real mother. So, she would care about that. 

01:11:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And… 

01:11:30
CHRIS And she still does. Yeah, I heard… I've never even see my stepmother now. It's been, like, 10- 15 years since I've seen her. So… 

01:11:45
[sil.] 

01:11:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And fun, can you think of a specific memory that will illustrate how your relationship with your mother was fun? Yeah, specific memory. 

01:11:55
CHRIS Yes, she brought me a skateboard, and I used to go skateboarding at the skate park, instead of some other. I went to (inaudible ) and there use to be a skate park. She used to take me to and I used to do all the skate tricks my brother taught me how to do. And I always had fun with my skateboard and I took my skateboard everywhere I went in the neighborhood. And I would have fun that way. 

01:12:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good. 

01:12:25
[sil.] 

01:12:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, now I'd like to do the same thing regarding your father. Can you choose five words that describe your relationship with your father, going back as far as you can remember? 

01:12:45
CHRIS Umm… Well… Well, I guess with my father, there haven't been that many aspects, attributes actually. Happy and sad, fun and boring. Well, I guess love, but I don't think he… he expressed any hate towards me and I towards him. Hate… hate isn't there. I guess loving, he does love me. And I love him, so… 

01:13:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. So those will be your five words that would, sort of, describe your relationship as happy, sad, fun, boring and love. 

01:13:25
CHRIS Yeah, yeah. 

01:13:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Alright. 

01:13:30
CHRIS Yeah. 

01:13:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, great. And like we did with your… with your mom, can you think of a specific memory or incident that would illustrate how your relationship with your father was happy? 

01:13:45
CHRIS Happy? 

01:13:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

01:13:45
CHRIS I guess I was happy when… I… I guess I was happy when they… when my mother, my biological parents, him and mom stopped fighting and separated. It was happy when I moved back with them and found a new family. But I still kept in touch with my mother. I guess it was fun that way. Or it could have been fun in another way, you know, going to hockey camp, took me to hockey camp, and it was fun. Doing hockey or fun going fishing, fun going to the near reservation and fun jumping of the quarry there. It was a… It was a 80 foot quarry, me and my brother, my biological half-brother. He almost, I was like 10-years-old. I guess you could say it was crazy in 80 feet. And I wouldn't dive, I'd just jump straight in, feet first. My brother dove. My grandfather used to… my biological grandfather (inaudible ). He used to jump off of it in an island bridge. It was fun. Yeah, fun. I… I would have fun with my dad. Shooting like a shotgun at then you have reservation. I was meeting relatives out there, so had fun going out there and… 

01:15:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Can you think of a specific memory that would illustrate how your relationship with your father was sad? 

01:15:20
CHRIS Yeah, it would be sad when, you know, I wouldn't be able to get do what I wanted to do on the weekends 'cause he wasn't home. He had work, travel. He used to travel for his company. And do work for his company. And he wouldn't be home and I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted to do. It was permitted by him to do so, or my stepmother, my stepmother didn't have any money with her. My dad had the money. And I'd be mad at my stepmother for not letting me do what I want to do on the weekend after school. Or… sad 'cause he'd be drunk, because is an alcoholic. And alcoholics… So I'll be sad but, you know, I had to cope with it on my own I guess, starting to cope with my own. Probably came from the discipline aspect my mother… my stepmother applied to me. Kind of raised me caught in the law and stuff, and handle my… handle my sense(ph) in a positive way, some constructive, rather than taking out other people, or write graffiti on the walls and stuff. 

01:16:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Let's see, fun. Can you think of a specific memory that would illustrate how your relationship with your father was fun? 

01:16:50
CHRIS Okay. Well, he was, umm… fishing. And it was funny, actually, but he caught a hook in his mouth, fishing. Just about… just about before the time I caught my first fish, in the northern pike I caught, it was small, but I still caught it. I guess that was fun, going… going out in the boat. And steering the boat was kind of fun, with my friend. And I guess the whole fishing trip was fun because we get the… we got to drive through the hose and see the country side. Just the whole trip was fun. Ordered out to eat, you know, had stuff to eat on the way. (inaudible ). 

01:17:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Boring, you used that word to characterize your relationship with your father. Can you think of a specific memory that would illustrate how the relationship was boring? 

01:18:00
CHRIS Yeah. Sunday, watching stat… NASCAR or something, I guess, when there is nothing else to do. At home, it's boring, just like, when there is nothing else to do, I guess. When I was… When he was raising me from the same time period, as my mother, you asked. Yeah, okay. Boring then was the probably the… I guess, boring then was probably cleaning up my room or helping with the dishes or something. 

01:18:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. Now I wonder could you tell me to which parent did you feel the closest, and why? And why you don't have that feeling for the other parent? 

01:18:55
CHRIS No, they're both the same. 

01:18:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. I think you, kind of, get the idea from that. Umm… Comments, questions about… That's again, he then moved on to his father, and I think there might have been one other person who took care of him. So, it might have been… there might have been three iterations of this. Yes? 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:19:16
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good question. So the question was his body language, you know, he had his arms folded, he seemed kind of close. Does that play a part in this? I'll answer that in two different ways. If you're really using this to try to… as a window into his state of mind with respect to attachment, then the answer is no. If you're going to be using it more broadly, in terms of… for clinical purposes and bringing your clinical understanding to bear on the responses, then, yes, it would be something we take into account. But… But if… if in the report when I'm just talking about the state of mind with respect to attachment, his daughter's(ph) state of mind with respect to attachment, the kind of pattern of attachment you would want in a caregiver, did his match it or not. Then no, his body language doesn't play a role in how you would interpret it. What you would be… pardon me, what you would be looking are just those dimensions in the quality of his answers. Was… Was it relevant, consistent, coherent, succinct, but comprehensive, truthful, was there evidence for what he said? All of those dimensions. 

01:20:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:20:26
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I'm sorry. 

01:20:26
UNKNOWN Was that a good interview? 

01:20:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Was that a good interview? Well, it was a good interview and it gave me a lot of material. 

01:20:35
UNKNOWN But in regards to his attachment, in regards to him showing that he has some secure attachment to… 

01:20:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Ah. Oh, okay. Oh, oh, so you're asking how I would characterize his pattern of attachment? Oh. Good question. So how would I characterize it? I will answer that. But before I do that, I'd just like to hear some other comments and opinions on what you saw, what you would make of it. And then I will… I will answer that. Oh. Oh, okay, good. You have… You have some ideas. Okay. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN In regards, I did notice the way that he was sitting, and the way that I saw it was (inaudible )? 

01:21:11
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No. But that's… 

01:21:11
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm sorry. 

01:21:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's an interesting guess. 

01:21:15
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. Look, but this is just like live, we're not knowing anything… 

01:21:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right, so now… you're a parent actually. Go ahead. I'm only kidding. 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN I understand. 

01:21:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I'm sorry, go ahead. 

01:21:25
UNKNOWN What I saw is that he was nervous. And that he may have seen the interview… interviewer as an authority figure, which would have made him be a little more withdrawn. But I think that he answered the questions coherently, from what I saw. He gave you… was able to provide examples. They weren't… They weren't long and detailed, but they were still to point. 

01:21:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. 

01:21:55
UNKNOWN I've got a different question about that. Coherency under this situation where this child (inaudible ). How do you characterize that anxiety, that pressure on him? How are you interpreting it, we can't hear and see anything? 

01:22:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, it certainly… The question is how do you factor in, you know, that's… kind of, somewhat stressful interview. You'd think about that. But even under non-stressful situations, it is an anxiety provoking interview. Again, that was the… that was sort of the real insight for the psychologist in Singapore, when she went through it despite knowing every question I was going to ask, what the purpose was, how we'd interpret it. She still found it was… it was stressful. And she said things that she never thought about before. So… But yeah, you'd want to take into account that this is not its restful peace. Nonetheless, you can still… because you're not looking at one… we're not looking at just these… just this eight or nine-minute clip. You're looking at the whole hour interview and all of those other, like, 19 or 20 questions and how they were answered. Yes? 

01:23:10
UNKNOWN What is the… 

01:23:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then there and there. 

01:23:10
UNKNOWN The relationship and (inaudible ), that seems a lot, you know, a skateboard and… not so much about the relationship, but doing things and… 

01:23:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, that's true. That's little more content. Again, what we want… again, this is where you may bring your clinical prospective into play, and that's relevant for the… for just accessing pattern of attachment. We're not looking at content, we're just looking at the process, the manner in which. So, we look at the manner in which he described those… the things. You see. Did you have your hand up? Yeah, I was going to call on you, you and then you. How's that? Okay. 

01:23:55
(inaudible) 

01:24:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You and then you. 

01:24:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, I thought it was interesting that… it surprised me when he described his relationship with his mother as caring because then he turned around and said that, you know, it was caring because she cared about what he thought about the stepmother. That was totally different than what I expected he would say. It almost seemed like the skateboard was an attachment to his mother because his mother gave the skateboard. He mentioned that. He still has current issues because he was saying, "I haven't seen my stepmother in 15 years." 

01:24:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. 

01:24:55
UNKNOWN But, you know, so that… that seemed to be an issue for him. 

01:25:00
UNKNOWN I was just thinking about the structure of it. I like the fact that there is that follow up, not just giving the adjective, but okay what's… you know, give me a specific thing. Because what struck me about this interview was he started in a play some of their note, interviewing prospective adoptive parents, you get a lot that's very dry, you know, when you just ask for the (inaudible ). But it was so loving, it was pleasant, you know, you get that. 

01:25:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. 

01:25:25
UNKNOWN And it was so helpful to then ask for those really specific memories, because the more he… he thought about it, the longer he sat in that room to answer, he was able to come up with something. I mean, even when he was talking about his dad and he started out just talking about how he would give him money. But then, the more he thought about it, he also came up with… he would take him fishing, he always came to my games and my grandfather was there too and… I just liked the structure. But it does pull out more. 

01:26:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, the… the… Mary Main, who developed this, described this is a interview whose purpose is to surprise the unconscious, so that you get these kinds of responses. Was there any questions over here? Well I've… actually I think Harry now… now actually has a question. He is not just scratching his head. I knew I'd get something from you eventually. 

01:26:20
HARRY You said… I kind of question the quality of what he had to say. And I can't tell really whether that's released subjectively or the questions weren't really that he understood all the time. The purpose of what you were… what was going on. 

01:26:40
(inaudible) 

01:26:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, he was kind of flat. He gave very concrete answers. In the protocol… 

01:26:55
HARRY (inaudible ). 

01:27:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, that was him, because he'd get other answers from different people. In the… In the interview protocol, there are probes. So, you noticed at one point I said, "That's… that's a good general answer, but can you gave me a specific." Again, just to make sure the person really understands. There are probes that you then go to just… just to make sure that they really do understand. Well, if they gave, for example, if they gave an answer… an answer in response to can you give me five adjectives, if they don't know what that is, then there… there's some other questions you can ask that say the same thing. It's a… It's a nice… nice. It's laid out very nicely in that regard. Other comments or… Yes? 

01:27:40
UNKNOWN It just striked me as… that I when you say, what you say, but making the assessment here on a relation… relational ability(ph) for someone they have a relationship with, the vulnerability they have with someone they have a attachment, but you're measuring, through this interview, really are behavioral responses, and not are… are constant. 

01:28:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, we're not doing behavioral responses. What we're looking at is the process and the manner in which they answer. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN But we're not looking at the content. 

01:28:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. We're not at the content. 

01:28:20
UNKNOWN And we're not looking at how they are responding to these relational leads. 

01:28:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Exactly, what you're looking at is their state of mind with respect to attachment, which you measure by the nature and quality and the manner in which they respond to these questions that evoke emotional material. That's… That's the essence of the Adult Attachment Interview. It's assessing… 

01:28:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:28:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, yeah. I just want to make sure there are no other comments or questions before I do that. 

01:28:50
UNKNOWN We are all, sort of, responding to the… 

01:28:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I know, I was gonna… 

01:28:50
UNKNOWN A general process. I think it'd be like a workshop where we don't care as much about what you say in the a lot care how you feel. 

01:29:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. 

01:29:00
UNKNOWN But I think it's hard for us to shift out of content. 

01:29:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Content, right, right. The… And so that's what I was going to… But any… before I get to that, any other… Yeah? 

01:29:10
UNKNOWN I hope I'm not (inaudible ), (inaudible ) research systems that was really well-founded, but it is good to assess, you know, an adult perhaps, and their past connections, (inaudible ) What are your ideas of good instruments that will assess a child's current attachment or (inaudible ). I know, if you want (inaudible ) attachment, the sort of questionnaire is born, but I don't think it's great. Umm… What… 

01:29:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, there are a lot of instances. There are a lot… not instruments. You really can't use a questionnaire to access pattern of attachment, because it's relational. There are a lot of protocols you can use for this. There's the Ainsworth Strange Situation protocol, there are some procedures you can use with older kids. If you want to come talk to me afterwards, we can talk about that. I just don't want to get into that now, because I really want to keep this focused on assessing parent capacity. But there are some procedures, protocols you can use to assess a child's or a teenagers pattern of attachment. And you can you use Adult Attachment Interview, and if you read the book that I mentioned, they talk about using with 16, 17 year olds on up. Okay? Any other comments then about Chris before I throw out my, you know, one or two sense? No, okay. So what I would say is, yeah, a lot of your comments were about content, not process. If you just listen to the manner in which he answered the questions… First of all, they weren't always to the point, first of all. He didn't always have specifics, even when he talked about his dad taking him fishing. He was talking generally about fishing. Not about, "I can remember being nine years old, and he took me up on Christmas to go…" or… I guess you don't fish on Christmas. Shows you how much I know. But I guess you could ice fishing. But anyway… I have a wandering mind. But you think… he really did not give a specific memory. In fact, I forget exactly now, but I think they were really only out of the five adjectives, I think there were only two that were… they were… they were specific memories. The other three were more general. So we have someone who at the very least is evidencing some avoiding patterns. Okay? There were other aspects of his other answers to questions, but even some of these that really lend itself… lend you more to thinking about a disorganized pattern, because his answers weren't always that relevant. Sometimes they were. But there were other times they really were not relevant. Umm… so anyway that was… that would be some of my observations. But what you really want to be thinking about is the manner in which he answered the questions. Whether he talks about, for example, crying or not. Certainly, the content was a little odd in terms of loving. But that actually would be an example of… it was complete and consistent. Was it relevant? Well, he was describing, in his mind, how she was loving, maybe, maybe not, but if you just look at the manner in which he described that, that wasn't too odd. It's the content that might have been odd but not the manner in which he did it He described it. Okay. But anyway, based on his entire interview, he would… I classified him as having a disorganized pattern of attachment. And then that was the basis for me saying he, and then his wife as well, they didn't have the ability at this point in time, to provide the kind of environment that their daughter needed. Because she… she had significant trauma, significant disorders of attachment. She needed to be placed in a home with caregivers who had a secure pattern of attachment. Okay? I'm sorry. 

01:33:25
UNKNOWN Did they relinquish? 

01:33:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, no. Their rights were terminated. Had to go to court, do his court hearing, they were terminated. She was adopted by the foster family, and I still see them occasionally. She started out at interesting in the foster family. She was two and a half when she moved in, didn't speak, wasn't toilet trained. You know, would stand kind of like that. Now… how old is she now? I think she's five. Comes into my office, she's a little chatty Kathy, very friendly. Umm… But also, just… you know, she's just a nice kid at this point, you know. Like, if she has to sit in the waiting room while I talk to her mom. You know, when I poke my head and say, "Oh, can I take that book and look at it?" You know, she would ask. She's just very nice little kid at this point. Come a long way in the years. But that's because the family she's placed with, they both have a secure pattern of attachment. Their commitment was very strong. They are very insightful. They've come a long way in developing their insightfulness. Their sensitivity to this girl is really quite… quite good. So all of the factors that would lead us to think that would be a good placement, were in place. And for her, it turned out to be a wonderful experience. Okay. Any other questions? Oh, yeah, here. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:35:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The cultural considerations, I think, would come in more in content, less… less in process. So for example, I want to get back to our presentation here. Just for example, when I was in Singapore and I was doing some discussions about how important it is… it is to repair a relationship, and you might want to have a parent to, you know, apologize if they had mistreated their child. And someone pointed, in the audience, pointed out to me that you would never ever get a Chinese father to say he's sorry to his kid. They just wouldn't do that. Now, what you couldn't get, and certainly would get, is a Chinese father who's remorseful and regretful about what he did to a kid. Might… that kid might come home one day and find that her dad had prepared an elegant special banquet. And that's how… So… so yeah, so it's more content than… than process. Because the… the Strength Situation Protocol has been used internationally. And you find similar patterns and similar percentages internationally, United States, Uganda, China, all over the world. But again, you're looking at process, not content. Other… other questions? Okay. What I want to do then for the last couple of minutes is just talk about, now, some implications of all of this. So what would you use this stuff for? Well, you're going to use it for treatment readiness. And by that I mean family based treatment with the child to work on that relationship. The parents may not be ready for that, in which case, they're ready for treatment to help work through some of these issues to look at their commitment, to look at their insightfulness, to help them develop greater reflective abilities. Right? They're ready for that. So when I talk about treatment readiness, I'm really talking about family based treatment to work on the parent-child relationship trauma and attachment issues. Okay? Placement, all of this becomes very important… We do a horrible job of matching, you know, we take this of you, in child welfare, "any port in a storm". And that just isn't true. It just doesn't work that way. We do a little bit of matching in that we will specially train and match medically fragile children with certain families. But when it comes to psychological fragility and psychological needs, we don't do that. And that's a mistake, and I believe that that's one of the reasons that we have so many disruptions. I remember one group of child welfare professionals I was working with, they described, on average, in a typical year, they have anywhere… each person has anywhere from six to twelve disruptions. Are there any child welfare professionals in the room? Does that sound right or does that sound high or low? Six to twelve? And about six to twelve. And that when you have a disruption, they were reporting, when they have a disruption, because it's never planned, right, they just get the call, "Get this kid out of my home, now." That pretty much… it eats up at least a week, sometimes two weeks of time until life's back to normal. Does that sound about right? A week or two, kind of, blows your schedule, right, yeah. So if you think about it, one to two weeks, 12 disruptions a year, 24 weeks, what is that? Four, eight, twelve, 16, that's four to five months a year of staff time that gets devoted to handling disruptions. So if better matching… and it does take work, right? You're going to have to find someone to, say, do the AAI, you're gonna have to do much more careful screening, more assessment. But if… let's say better matching reduces your disruptions by just even 20%. That's a lot of time, and I believe, if we did as good assessments and better matching, it really wouldn't require any more time of anybody. It would just be a better allocation. So it wouldn't burden anybody more, it would be a different use of time. And in the long run, it would be so much better for the kids. Yes? 

01:39:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:39:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, I'm talking about doing all of this. So you would need a professional to do the say, AAI, unless, you know… 

01:39:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:39:46
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What I would recommend, if you're asking me, what I would recommend is after you've recruited a family, done all the required screenings, done the home study. They took all the required training. And now you're ready to approve them. Before you approve them, somebody do the IAI, or modified AAI, so now you can do matching. So you need to do that piece. We need to be thinking about commitment. And we need to be thinking about, again, just generally the implication being our most difficult kids… it's counter intuitive, but it makes sense when you read the material, our most difficult kids need to go with our newest families, with a lot of support. But again, if you're having fewer disruptions, you probably can provide more support. Right? So that's what I'm talking about. Umm… so not only would it not take any additional staff time, I believe it will be better use staff time, I believe… In addition, if anybody cares, it would be better for the kids. Fewer disruptions, means, you know, fewer difficulties, means more adoptable children. Or it means children who when they do get reunited with their families, are in a much better state. So that when you do the reunification, if you have a child who's in a better state, and maybe the family's in just a little bit better state, maybe then that reunification can work. Whereas before, if you'd moved in three or four times, and the kid is in a very, you know, fragile state, the unification wouldn't work. I'll get off my soapbox now. 

01:41:20
UNKNOWN I think we need to educate the case workers, and educate the system as a whole, because in our state, they don't recognize attachment as being an issue. So it might not necessarily be that they move the child because the family wants them moved. The case worker might get angry with the foster parent or the case workers thinks they need to go somewhere else. So the case worker just takes them and moves them somewhere else, and doesn't acknowledge the fact that when they do that, it creates trauma, it creates more issues… I think… Well, we can do put it all in the foster parents. I think we need to train people who are… recruit foster parents who are giving children individually more… 

01:42:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, and again, I would think it's really more of a general policy issue we need, that there needs to be some understanding of the importance of an attachment framework in the child welfare system. And that's a whole another presentation I have on, the implications of attachment theory for child welfare, practice for policy, programming and then the child welfare professionals. But really, the policy and understanding has to come first at a higher level before you can expect staff to begin to implement that. And if you don't have the right policies in the administrative support, to expect caseworker to then implement that, it's just… you can't… it's not realistic. 

01:42:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:42:42
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, sure. 

01:42:45
UNKNOWN What were… the case workers who work in (inaudible ) I mean, there is no judicial overview. (inaudible )… 

01:42:55
UNKNOWN Forster parent, yeah. 

01:43:00
[sil.] 

01:43:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) Like, in New York state, we work in New York City, there we have a program that do matching and they would like us to stop the matching completely, and the reason they'd like us to stop matching completely is because it is not cost-effective for the city. They don't want… and they have kids awaiting placements that I say I need four to six weeks to match this child, they say, "You can't have four to six weeks, 'cause the kid has to come out of a residential program… 

01:43:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right, that's what I'm saying. You need to do the screening ahead of time. You do that before you finally approve them so that you can say, "Oh, this is a good family for a medically fragile kid." "Oh, this family would be good for a kid with complex trauma, disorders of attachment. We just got them certified. We're going to hold, you know, they'll be for to that." "This family's better for that," so that there isn't the four to six week wait. You just know who is ready for who, just like we do with medically fragile kids. 

01:44:05
UNKNOWN So, we have that the case to make sure that people in state legislatures and people in general see that our office populated relation is worth spending money on, and that they're putting money towards an… and spending resources on… Because the population that we're talking about are really they decide franchise and they're not… they don't have voice, and who get the dregs of what society, and that do not said… 

01:44:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, ultimately I believe that during the screening, that I talked About, doing the matching, ultimately results in better care. It really doesn't cost any more. It might actually save money in some regards. I really see that we're pretty much out of time now. So I want to thank you for having patience with the technical glitches and for listening, and for being clear. And then have a good rest of the conference. Thank you. Thank you.
