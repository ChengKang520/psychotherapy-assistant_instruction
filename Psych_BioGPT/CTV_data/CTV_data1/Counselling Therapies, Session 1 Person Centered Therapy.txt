AIPC Presents Counsellign Therapies Session 1: Person Centred Therapy 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN Um, okay, Max, I understand that you had some concerns that you'd like to discuss today. Um, so whenever you're ready I'm happy for you to voice whatever it is that you'd like to talk about. 

00:00:30
MAX Yeah, well, I suppose the bottom line is that I'm having some difficulties in my relationship with my wife. And I am very uncertain about actually being here. It's been embarrassing talking about those things with a stranger. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. So you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable discussing such personal information with an outsider. 

00:00:50
MAX Yes, it is, um, a bit awkward. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN Really. 

00:00:55
MAX I was brought up with solving problems yourself. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:00:55
MAX And, and the only time I ever (inaudible ) problems to strangers. And I, I would (inaudible ) but also I realized now that given a, a, the depth of the problem that I'll say, needed to get another perspective on things. 

00:01:10
unconditional positive regard 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN Okay. All right. I guess, um, what I generally say to people when they first come along is that it's not uncommon to feel quite uncomfortable talking to an outsider about such personal information. And, um, even though I can't predict exactly how you're gonna feel and how things will go for you today, I do know that in the past a lot of other people have, have actually felt quite uncomfortable to begin with, but as they've been able to talk and, and get things off their chest they actually feel quite relieved. So you might find that, that as we spend more time together that you're more comfortable in this environment, too. 

00:01:50
MAX Well, I have to accept that one. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. We'll see how we go. 

00:01:50
MAX Yeah. Well there's a friend of mine who's been involved in counseling (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:01:55
MAX . . . who suggested that this is what I, I should attempt to do, anyway. (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. Okay. And you were saying before as well that, um, that normally you like to solve things yourself and, and work things out yourself. And, um, I think it's quite a balanced perspective to, to be looking at how you're gonna resolve things yourself, and also to get an outside perspective as well. So, um, I can see lots of benefit that can come from, from that dual approach. 

00:02:25
MAX Well I, I haven't succeeded in doing it by myself, so . . . 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:30
MAX It's worth a game. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. So perhaps we can, we can shed some light on, on some helpful approaches for you. Yeah. Okay. Um, I guess, to help me understand your situation, um, it'd be helpful if you could talk a little bit about what's been going on for you and what's brought you along. 

00:02:50
MAX Well, uh, I suppose things are just deteriorated in my relationship with my wife, um, Angelina. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Really. 

00:02:55
MAX Oh, we've been married 11 years now and we've got two kiddies, John is 9 and Jackie is 7. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:03:00
MAX And she's very busy in her job and she's always been a, I suppose a bit of control freak. She likes things to be just so. And, uh, occasionally she would, what I would call 'lose the (inaudible )', she'd yell at me and abuse me, but, um, in the past that was never a problem because we could sit down and talk about it and she'd recognize that she'd probably gone over the top and, and whatever. Uh, but lately it's really just gotten out of hand and that's, uh, it's, uh, she's not controlling her anger, her temper. And, uh, it, it really concerns me now because, uh, I think it's starting to affect the kids. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Right, okay. So it sounds like to begin with, she might often become quite angry but she would settle down and you could resolve things. But of late it's become a lot more volatile and, um, she's become more explosive and it, and you're really concerned about the impact on yourself and the children. 

00:04:00
MAX Yeah. I mean the kids are young and, uh, uh, I mean, John, John, he's a boy and he seems to be handling things okay. Um, but you, you're always uncertain as to what really, how things are affecting him. Jackie is, uh, Jackie is only 7, as I said, and, uh, she's a lot more sensitive. And I just, she's not really handling things too well at all. And, uh, and that's really starting to, um, put a lot of extra, uh, concern to me. 

00:04:30
empathy 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. So it sounds like you've, you've got a lot of concerns about both the kids. And John's probably handling it okay, outwardly, even though obviously he's feeling it. But Jackie you're particularly concerned about because she's quite delicate. And you're worried about that impact. 

00:04:45
MAX Yeah. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN And all of you are walking around on eggshells at the moment, um, just waiting for some kind of explosion to happen. Does that sound right? 

00:05:00
MAX Uh, well, I'm concerned about the kids but I'm concerned about the marriage. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:00
MAX It's, it's important to me to do what you can to keep things together. I mean, because that's . . . 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:05
MAX . . .that's better for the kids. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:10
MAX Better for (inaudible ) one major concern would be probably for Jackie. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Yeah. 

00:05:15
MAX Because, uh, there's been a few incidents lately where, um, the kids have been exposed in full glory of this sort of volatile, angry behavior. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:05:25
MAX And, um, that's really starting to worry me a lot. 

00:05:25
congruency 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. Yeah. I guess I'm, I'm very impressed to, um, to see how much you, you're obviously devoted to the children. And you're certainly putting their welfare first and you want to make sure that they're in a stable environment so that they're okay. And I think obviously that's, that's a credit to you as a father that they've got you available. 

00:05:50
MAX Those kids just mean everything to me. Yeah. They're just a total delight. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:50
MAX I mean (inaudible ) they, they just deal with it. 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And it's really clear. When you, when you talk about them your face lights up, so they're obviously, they've obviously very special and very important. 

00:06:05
MAX Yes, they are. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, just in terms of helping me to understand exactly what's going on between yourself and Angelina that's, that's causing you such distress, uh, would you be able to give me perhaps a, a recent example of, of a time where you did have some conflict and, and talk about what happened? 

00:06:25
MAX Uh, yeah, a couple of weeks ago, um, she'd been very busy so, uh, just to make things easier for her I, I went out of my way and, on the way home from work and, and picked up the dry cleaning. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:06:40
MAX And I got home probably half an hour late . . . 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:06:45
MAX . . . than what I normally would. And, um, she didn't ask me why I was late or, or whatever, she just, uh, went into a tirade of abuse. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:06:50
MAX And, uh, um, uh, wouldn't listen to any comments or observations I had to make about it. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:07:00
MAX And, uh, and probably the worst part for me was that, uh, both the kiddies were there. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:05
MAX And, uh, and you could see, uh, particularly with the young, Jackie, the, the impact it was having on them. And, uh, it just, um, uh, really just broke my heart. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Mm. Okay, okay. So that sounds like it was very upsetting to, for you to be involved in that and to witness. 

00:07:20
MAX Oh, it was extremely upsetting. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:20
MAX Because nothing I said or did was, was, was gonna ease the situation. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. 

00:07:25
MAX Uh, it just went on and on and on until she, she burned out of the anger. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Right. Yeah. And what actually happened after, um, after she did burn out? Um, what happened with the kids in terms of helping to s-, to resolve things? 

00:07:40
MAX Well the kids, the kids were very restless that night. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:07:45
MAX Um, uh, very clingy to me. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:45
MAX Um, a bit shocked and surprised. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:50
MAX Uh, these things have been going on for a while but this was the first time the kids had actually been fully exposed, uh . . . 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:00
MAX . . . to the, uh, I suppose the full spectrum of the abuse and the ranting and raving. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:08:05
MAX Just the volatile nature of it (crosstalk) quite hostile. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. So that was a specifically bad incident? 

00:08:10
MAX Mm, yeah. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. And, and how often does this tend to happen? 

00:08:15
MAX Uh, it's episodic. Um, it's always there underneath the surface. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:08:20
MAX Um, sometimes it might be, sometimes it might be every day . . . 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Mm. Yeah. 

00:08:25
MAX . . . sometimes it might be once a week, once a fortnight. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:30
MAX Um, that's, because there's no rhyme, no reason to things, that's actually adding to the, the difficulty because, um, it's, I find it's starting to affect my work. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Mm. Right. 

00:08:40
MAX And, uh, I think myself and the kids are starting to walk on eggshells a little bit. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. 

00:08:45
MAX And that's, that's a very unhealthy environment . . . for the children. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it's, it's affecting the children but it's spilled over into your work environment as well and you're feeling uncomfortable when you're at work, is that right? 

00:08:55
MAX I find myself sometimes not focusing on my work and . . . 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:09:00
MAX . . . and thinking about, how can I fix things up at home so that, um, you know, Angelina's more settled, uh, there's more . . . 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:10
MAX . . . there's more peaceful, harmonious life. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:10
MAX . . . um, that we used to have. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:09:15
MAX Uh, the kids' lives are not so disrupted. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:09:15
MAX You know, they're note exposed to this . . . 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:20
MAX . . . um, intense and negative emotion. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. So it sounds like, Max, for you it's a very constant and unrelenting distress. It's, it's at home, it's at work, and you're feeling it a lot. 

00:09:30
MAX Yeah, it's, um, it's starting to be, uh, nonstop, in terms of my thinking. 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. 

00:09:40
MAX I think about it at work, I think about it at home. 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:40
MAX Um, walking on eggshells . . . 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:45
MAX Um, when Angelina goes to sleep I'll stay awake thinking. Uh, in terms of what I might be able to do. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:55
MAX Mm, yeah. And sometimes I just think I'd like some peace, and I'd like some peace for the kiddies, um, uh, particularly around Jackie because I think she's really feeling it. I wonder whether maybe I should just leave. Um, so at least the kids can have some peace. Because if I'm not there, maybe Angelina won't have a target. 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:25
MAX It's a big step, isn't it. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:25
MAX Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN It's a big step to take to think of leaving. 

00:10:30
MAX Yeah. I've thought about it. I, I've never discussed it with anybody. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:10:30
MAX Um, but hearing myself say, uh, that leaving the relationship would be a, a possible solution is, um, uh, it's a bit threatening. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Mm. Right. 

00:10:45
MAX For the whole stability of the kids. Beacuse, um, I think it's important to do whatever you can to keep the relationship going. (inaudible ) leave if we can work at resolving these issues then, um, the kids will be (inaudible ) better off. 

00:11:03
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:11:05
MAX As part of a family with me taking off and having to battle through explaining everything to the kids (inaudible ). 

00:11:14
UNKNOWN Right, right. Um, okay, Max, if I could just summarize what we've talked about so far. Um, you explained to me that you've become very frustrated and, and tired and I think worn out, with a lot of the anger and a lot of the volatility in the relationship that you have with Angelina. And you are very worried about the impact on both Jackie and John. And you've been so worried, in fact, that you've considered leaving, uh, but it's also occurred to you that that's a, a major step to take and it's one that you would prefer not to do. And that, that makes you think that you want to work even harder to actually restore things between yourself and Angelina. And, and work things through so that, um, you can actually be more harmonious and, and live together in peace as a family. 

00:12:00
MAX Mm. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Would that cover it, for you? 

00:12:05
MAX Yeah. That summarizes pretty accurately where we're at at the moment. That's, that, that would be my strong preference. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN Right. Right. 

00:12:15
MAX (inaudible ) 

00:12:18
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. 

00:12:18
MAX I'd probably, I'd probably (inaudible ) gonna be so difficult for the kids. 

00:12:21
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, I guess, um, this might be as good a time as any just to draw things together and perhaps finish for now and, um, perhaps if you wanted to work with me on this I'd be very happy to support you in whatever it is that you'd like to do in the future, in your relationship with Angelina and, and restoring the family . . . 

00:12:45
MAX Mm. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN . . . to what it once was and, and moving forward. 

00:12:45
MAX I'd be really happy to do that. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:12:50
MAX Because it's, I think a lot, lot, a lot of things have been clarified for me. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:12:55
MAX I think I've got a better perspective of what the options are and what the, and what the downsides of silly (ph) thinking would be. 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:13:00
MAX So I, I really appreciate talking with you. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Okay. All right. Thanks, Max. 

00:13:05
MAX Thank you very much.
