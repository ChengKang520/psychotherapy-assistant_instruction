MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The 24th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education PRESENTS: Suzette Speight, Ph.D. Loyola University, Chicago, IL Boundaries and Solidarity: The Importance of Being Real 

00:00:00
DR. SUZETTE SPEIGHT  Well, thank you. It's nice to be here and nice to see some friendly faces. I'm going to talk about three constructs that I'm, uhm, hoping to weave together and really, ah, by way of further introduction, I wanna also say something about myself as it connects to solidarity because solidarity is about shared history and collective identity which we'll see in a second. I wanted to say that, I think to remind, ah, all of us that we're just a 140 years out of slavery. And what that means concretely in my actual family is that my mother's grandfather, my great grandfather, uhm, remembers, well, we have the story, that he remembers seeing the soldiers at the end of the Civil War marching away, uhm, when he was in the Carolinas. So, that means that my great grandfather was a boy at the end of slavery which mean he was emancipated with the proclamation. It also means that my mother who, if you asked her today, would tell you that she thought she would, could have been a scientist, uhm, didn't have those educational opportunities. And it also means that my father who was a star football player in Western Pennsylvania, uhm, wasn't able to go to Penn State University and play football. And then, closer to home, for me specifically, it means I remember going to visit cousins in Tennessee when I was small and they took me to the movies and I went to sit in the front and they said, "No, we're supposed to sit back here. See the bar? We sit back here." History is not far away and it's not a long time ago. That's four generations in my family and that relates to solidarity. I'll get there in a minute. But my goal today is to, to find solidarity, to re-examine the concept of boundaries, to define and illustrate being real and to somehow weave these all together. Uhm, so, in some measure, this is a exercise in me talking out loud, so I hope you'll indulge me a bit as I'm trying to put some things together in my mind. So let's start with solidarity. Solidarity refers to the feeling or the condition of unity based on common goals, interests and sympathies among a group's members. It's really the ties in a society that bind people to one another. Solidarity also has it a, a key affective foundation that is caring sincerely and intensely about the varieties of human misery. You know, when you hear the word solidarity, it's easy to think about it in terms of, ah, workers and labor movement. You will recall Lech Walesa and the large Solidarity Movement that really was responsible for overthrowing the communist regime in Poland in the '80s. Uhm, so there's a sense of workers sort of fighting, resisting their, uhm, exploitation but solidarity really does have a larger religious, ethical, moral and philosophical grounding. Uhm, Pope John Paul II talked about, ah, radical equality of, of all human beings, that we're all one human family and upon that basis there is solidarity or should be solidarity. Erich Fromm was concerned with solidarily, solidarity, which he conceptualized as really the ultimate ideal of feeling and action together. He thought that solidarity was essential for individual well-being as well as for a prod, peaceful and productive world. Fromm actually held a, uhm, Utopian view of society, uhm, where he saw that solidarity, this intense caring about the other was really the apex of human social behavior. What's interesting in our modern and, uhm, post-modern society, solidarity is really something that's exceptional because we're so preoccupied with our narrow, short-term individual self-interest. Fromm talks about that we function in the "having" mode rather than the "being" mode. Uhm, Roger, uhm, Rogers rather talked about, uhm, that we're in this era of post-emotionalism where there's a tendency for our feelings to be intellectualized, rather than sincerely felt, and that this is a cultural and even a structural feature of our Euro-Western society that's characterized by a sense of false niceness, politeness, political correctness and social restraint, which prevents disorder through the management or manipulation of feelings so that we know about the plight of oppressed, disadvantaged, poor people but this is gained from a safe distance via the media, rather than through routine daily interaction and so solidarity, uhm, has to be more personal than that. It has to be grounded in daily practice in terms of identifying with others in the pursuit of common goals. Now that's sort of a broad view of solidarity. Shelby spoke specifically about African-Americans and solidarity and I'm gonna be talking about African-Americans and I'm gonna be using myself as an example throughout this talk. Uhm, so Shelby was quite relevant for today. He talked about, ah, black solidarity as identifying, correcting and ultimately eliminating race-based injustice. And that he thought, he thinks this solidarity shouldn't be based on mere group identity but rather based on the common experience of anti-black racism. So this is a political or emancipatory solidarity, ah, which is to be distinguished from a social solidarity which, uhm, is not a means to some other end but a valuable objective in and of itself because the social solidarity nurtures communal relations, social interaction, a feeling of community among Americans of African descent. There's a expectation in this social solidarity of a common understanding based on an assumed cultural familiarity. I mean, you can say that it's highlighted by the, uhm, the phrase, "I am because we are, because we are, therefore, I am." That notion of extended self was all connected here with the idea of solidarity. Uhm, and there's even been some research that looked at solidarity. Uhm, these are communications, uhm, the next two studies I'm gonna talk about were from communications literature where there was, uhm, they did some qualitative interviewing with African-American women, in this instance, uhm, asking them to talk about their friendships and the finding was that solidarity was a essential concept and how the women described their intra-group friendships so that they, ah, and this solidarity, came about in three ways. They thought there was a uniqueness to their, the black women thought there was a uniqueness to their friendships with other black women. Uhm, they used black vernacular and they emphasized authentic communication. So, friendships formed and maintained solidarities. They recreated and nurtured black women's history and identity such that staying connected to these friends is really staying connected to this history. Uhm, one participant said, "Our color is more than just similarity, it's a bond." Uhm, and so this sense of being authentic, the communication has to be true, they have to be true to their identity, they use, ah, particular language, uhm, and this helps to build and maintain solidarity in community. Or in a similar study of African-American men, asked them about their friendships, ah, found that the men really valued connection with other, with other black men because they could understand those common problems, situations and pressures due to the multi-generational history of lived experiences with racism, discrimination and oppression. So, my premise here is that solidarity, uhm, which can be political or social or both, really is this sense of connection that folks feel based on assumptions of similar history, similar identity and I think that, uhm, this sense of solidarity also can exist between clinicians and clients. I also think it exists between professors and students but that's probably a different conversation. Uhm, so, let's move to boundaries then. So, as you know, ah, uhm, nothing new here, that boundaries are fundamental to the counseling or therapy process. They're set and maintained by the clinician according to acceptable, accepted professional standards and they're supposed to provide the therapeutic frame, right? Which sets the roles for the participants. Uhm, and one of, some of the basic principles underlying boundaries, the most important one is this rule of abstinence where the therapist refrains from obtaining personal gratification from the client. There's a duty to neutrality, uhm, so that the therapist sort of knows their place and allows the client's agenda to take center stage, right? The therapy is not about the therapist. And the therapist's relative anonymity helps with this neutrality and we know boundaries are important because they protect client welfare. So, the idea of crossing, altering or violating boundaries is negative and seen as dangerous potentially to clients, so that therapists are, who cross or alter or violate boundaries are seen as attempting to obtain gratification of their own personal needs. You know, it's not a good thing to cross boundaries. Uhm, you know, maybe the therapist is trying to make themselves feel special or the client feel special or trying to rescue the client but it's not good. And obviously, we most frequently talk about boundaries when we talk about sexual misconduct, the post-therapy relationships or multiple-relationships, right? These all sounds familiar to you. You also know when you read in the boundary literature that, uhm, there is acknowledgement that, ah, rural psychologists or small community psychologists are now acknowledged to experience many overlapping or dual relationships due to their heightened visibility and lack of anonymity in their small community, right? So your former client might end up being the kindergarten teacher of your child and there's really nothing you can do about that. Uhm, so these are sort of predictable dilemmas that rural psychologists might experience, uhm, and they are encouraged to sort of talk through this out-of-session contact with their clients to get informed consent, to monitor themselves et cetera, but you can see that it's not their fault. Uhm, these boundary crossings are not their fault. Uhm, they're regrettable but they didn't do anything wrong or bad. Now, what's interesting to me is that there is really little conversation, however, about the type of boundaries that clinicians should foster, meaning like, where should the boundary be? The amount of distance that the therapist should maintain is never quite defined but we all seem to know it's somewhere like or out here. Uhm, and so, to me this conversation of boundaries really universalizes the concept as if we all have the same connotation or the same agreement about what good boundaries really look like but I don't think we all do agree on what good boundaries are. The real truth is we just don't talk about our various views of boundaries and the reason we don't talk about it is because we don't want anyone to think we're unethical and having sex with our clients, right? Because, you know, that slippery slope concept, right? So, once you alter a boundary in any way it means that's just your first step down the (Laughs) slippery slope into taking your clothes off (Laughs) with your client, right? Uhm, now, I, I guess I think there's prob, must be something in between, uhm, (Laughs) and so, uhm, Lazarus, uhm, actually disagreed with this universal notion of boundaries. He argued in the literature and, trust me people, I argued back with him that this "blind adherence to artificial boundaries," his words, uhm, which he thought were motivated by risk management concerns really could be inhumane. So he told a story about while he was providing couples therapy, the husband, ah, talked about having a biopsy of a possible cancer and that the results will be available in a couple of days but their next session was scheduled for several weeks down the road and so after a couple of days, Lazarus called to inquire about how the lab results turned out. The man was grateful for Lazarus' concern but the woman of the couple, who was herself a clinical psychologist, was dismayed, uhm, and very angry and called it a boundary violation for him to have made that phone call. And Lazarus said that his call, he, a simple act of human decency and concern had been transferred in, had been transformed into a clinical assault. So my claim is that clinicians may establish various types of boundaries or cross boundaries for reasons centered on solidarity. Traditional mainstream, majority notions of boundaries are characterized by therapist professional distance, authority, non-reciprocity and anonymity. I think, however, that this dominant view of professional boundaries represents just one particular approach to boundaries. People may locate their boundaries differently due to valuing or prioritizing different aspects of their relationships with clients. So, when I think about myself as a clinician I was not distant, I'm talking in the past tense 'cause I closed my private practice. Uhm, when I think about myself as a clinician I was not distant, I was not anonymous nor did I desire to be. In fact, clients sought me out precisely because they knew me. Uhm, I used to say, when I thought about this, that I crossed boundaries but, ah, the more I think about it, ah, that's not accurate. It's more accurate to say that my boundaries were different in the first place. They were different from the boundaries I was taught to maintain in graduate school. So, in graduate school I was taught that my boundaries are supposed to be out here. In fact, there was an announcement in one of my practicums that we are no longer allowed to touch clients in any manner. So, of course, myself and my cohort, we, you know, had a, a lot of fun with that saying, "If our clients fell down we would say, get up the best way you know how. I'm not gonna help you." Well, you know, whatever. Uhm, I'm not allowed to help you. Uhm, so you know, we were taught that the boundaries are somewhere out here and I think my boundaries are somewhere like here. Uhm, actually the most accurate way to describe that would be to say that my boundaries are co-created with myself and my clients and many of you are nodding and smiling so I know I'm not alone here. I've had conversations with friends, African-American, Latina, ah, therapists who have stories about the things they have done for clients, on behalf of clients, with clients, they talk about the closeness of their relationships with clients and that they definitely do things differently than the way they were trained, some say, brainwashed. For instance, one of, did you catch what I said there? Okay. It's okay. You didn't react so I was a little okay. For instance, one of my friends, when she was a student, went to visit a client who'd been hospitalized due to a sudden medical illness after her supervisor told her it was a wrong thing to do. Her supervisor told her it was inappropriate to go to the hospital. Uhm, she went because she thought it was the right thing to do. She didn't tell her supervisor and I asked her recently if she'd do it again, she said, "Absolutely, 'cause it was the right thing to do." She said, "I stayed for 15 minutes, my client was very happy and grateful and so was the family that I bothered to stop by." Uhm, I've used my SUV to help a teenage client move out of a abusive house to a safe house. Uhm, I did it 'cause I thought it was the right thing to do. I'd do it again. Uhm, this was not some personal gratification or a precursor to exploiting the client. I did it 'cause that's what she needed. That was the type of help she needed. Uhm, she didn't need, need me to talk about how she felt about moving, she needed help moving. Uhm, I'm sorry. I should just stick to, I should stick to what I wrote, ah, okay, uhm, okay. I did these things due to my sense of connection, my obligation to a member of my community, what I now recognize as solidarity. Solidarity between an African-American clinician and an African-American client, is that permissible? Solidarity as communicated and maintained through authenticity, genuineness, warmth, closeness and a shared history and identity, so I'm a real whole person in that therapy room with my blackness, uhm, and I can relate to my client's individuality as well as their group identities. And as the client is a member of my in-group, I think I can be myself, comfortable, real and I think some of my clients want me to be. So, here we are at real. What is being real? So, I have some friends, I asked them, uhm, and they said things like "congruence," "genuine," "integrity," "being honest with yourself," "true to what you think is right and wrong," "not pretending to be something you're not," "being who you are," "honesty," "unpretentious," "not fake," "being plain," "forthright," "showing your true feelings," "being real can be freeing," they said, "because there are no extra layers, no extra energy since you're being your true self and not changing yourself depending on who you're with. It's what we're supposed to do, what we're supposed to be." Uhm, that's interesting. Earlise C. Ward, ah, fabulous study, uhm, a qualitative ins, investigation of African-American community, uhm, mental health center clients, uhm, entitled, "Keeping It Real," provided some illustrations about what clients really want in therapy. The clients were really concerned with counselor's responsiveness. They really wanted to know if the counselor was gonna respond to them as a real person. Uhm, here's a nice quote that illustrates that from a 44-year-old female. She said, "I'm real, I'm meaning to see who I'm talking to. That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking to feel you and I know I can feel things through pictures, through things and just being around the person's office and everything. So I'm looking to see who you are, that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking to see you 'cause I don't wanna share myself with someone I can't see. I'm looking to see you, to feel you." Uhm, Thompson, Bazile and Akbar, in a, a focus groups with 200 African-Americans, asked about their perceptions of therapy and therapist and they found among other interesting things that psychologists, uhm, were described as older white males who are unsympathetic, uncaring and unavailable. Psychologists were commonly thought of as impersonal, elitist and too far removed from the community to be of assistance to most African-Americans. But half of the participants believed that psychologists, unlike social workers and counselors, really failed to participate in community education and prevention and outreach and thus, they were reluctant to trust professionals who weren't active in their community. They said things like, "It doesn't seem like they truly care about you or what you're going through. They just, they just say like, "Well, I've got to get paid, your hour is up." Uhm, so, the participants really thought that psychologists couldn't be sensitive to the realities of their lives. Thompson, uhm, concluded that there is a need to examine relationship boundaries that we maintain in our profession because these might be misunderstood and perceived as a lack of caring because the African-Americans in their study really want a therapy relationship that's more consistent with their cultural expectations for relationships in general. Uhm, oh, Liz(ph), I forgot to ask you how to pronounce it. Cortez(ph) said, sorry, apologies, uhm, said that, uhm, he talked about his own first-hand experiences, uhm, as a therapist in several Latin-American countries and he said that Latin cultures, in his experience, emphasized these strong and warm, close community, family bonds and this results in overlapping, multiple relationships between clients and therapist and these are normal, these mixing of roles, self-disclosure, socializing together was seen as normal. He thought that this flexibility in relationships really fosters and increases authenticity and questions whether our limit, limiting ourselves to some antiseptic way of being with clients is really providing the best service. So, here's how I think they fit together. Let me tell you a story. I like to tell stories. So, a student of mine just told me, just about two weeks ago about the experience she had in therapy and in supervision, 'cause I was talking with her about this speech. And I asked her if she had ever done anything in therapy that felt like a boundary crossing and she told me, "Yes." She had a teenage girl client very recently whose mother was in jail, had, was a chronic substance abuser, father had recently come home from prison, ah, the girl had been acting up like crazy, sleeping around, uhm, with older guys, made a suicide attempt and was just generally out of control. The girl had quickly gained a reputation in the hospital for being difficult and guarded; she was there because of the suicide attempt. So they had a joint session with the girl, her father, the family's therapist, my student who was the girl's therapist to sort of say, "What's up?" Uhm, there became a pretty tense and emotional moment, the girl was crying, sad but angry and the father was frustrated, the girl becomes silent, withdrawn as the father is really exhorting her to not go down the same wrong path that he had gone down. Uhm, my student said everyone was really filled with emotion and her, her own eyes were brimmed with tears. Uh, and she reached out her hand and touched the girl on the forearm and said, "You know what, baby? We can't help you, if you don't tell us what's going on." So, very dramatic, and of course, the girl says, you know, everything in her life started going wrong when her mother went to prison. Okay. But more important to me was my student's rationale. So, my student reached out. She switched coats. She talked plain. She shared her emotions and she was real. And, I said, "Why did you do that?" She said, "Well, because I'm an older female, well, a big sister. And that was my, that's like my little sister." And it was like a big sister talking to a little sister, saying, "Let me figure out how to help you." That sounds like solidarity to me. Uhm, she said, what she did felt very natural. What did her supervisors, what did her African-American supervisors say? Well, one thought, "The comment flowed appropriately from a therapist being completely in the here and now, but it reflected the immediacy of the moment and thought it was indeed a good intervention and therapeutic." The other supervisor said, "The comment probably was a problem and maybe the client couldn't handle the therapist's emotions. Besides, it was not really professional." Uhm, it wasn't professional for her to speak that way, to use that language and actually ask my student, " Was the student trying to be a psychologist or a mentor to the girl?" So, that says a lot to me about, uhm, brainwashing, uhm, in terms of what a professional is supposed to be. But it also says a lot about this connection between boundaries, solidarity, and being real. I'm really glad my student had one supervisor who validated her and didn't tell her that what she did was wrong and probably many of you have similar stories. I certainly do. We don't talk about (Laughs) these, uh, stories of boundaries and solidarity and being real because of other people's judgments. In fact, I know I can be close and real and connected without being inappropriate and exploitive. I can tolerate these complexities in my professional relationships. I can be close and maintain boundaries simultaneously. This is called role flexibility. As one of my friends, sitting right here, uhm, said, " Keeping it real doesn't mean real open." Did you remember saying that? (Laughs) Keeping it real doesn't mean real open. I'm not telling my own business. That, you know, we're, we can have, be close and have boundaries. Uhm, my colleague and I, uhm, Dr. Liz Vera, conducted some focus groups with therapists at community-based agencies. Uhm, and we had a really fascinating conversation with the group of clinicians who do a lot of home-based services with African-American clients. And they spent a lot of time talking about being real and they also talked about boundaries and rules they had. So, for instance, they would ride a client in their car. They would do therapy in the home, but they would never hug a client and they would never eat or drink at a client's house. I mean, it was so funny, they're in the client's house, and I said, " Would you take some coffee?" they said, "No way. I would never drink coffee in their house." Ah, so they had boundaries. They were not these boundaries. They were these boundaries. Another group of clinicians that we talked about said they loved and adored their clients. They were close to them and they had rules. They said, "We love them, but it's not like they're visiting us at home or anything." So, these examples show that one can be real and have clear boundaries that function to protect clients. It is this feeling of solidarity that allows one to be real and to be closer than normal, closer than we're supposed to be. I think there is an inherent conflict here between being a "professional" or a so-called professional and being real. And I've had, had to figure out how to resolve that for myself. And for me, now I know, it's this notion of solidarity that is the resolution to that conflict. So I think being real, then, and this idea of boundaries and solidarity are mutually reinforcing. They influence and inform one another. But for me, solidarity calls for a different kind of professional. One who accompanies their comrade clients through the therapy process, uhm, with close boundaries and a real relationship. So, solidarity really troubles, questions the traditional notions that we have of the professional and professionalism. With solidarity, one can't be distant or anonymous. You wouldn't even want to be. You would be engaged and involved and real. Solidarity then gives me the language, the philosophy, the foundation, and the rationale to understand my experiences, and maybe even some of your experiences. So, I don't think this is a black thing only. Even though I used myself as the example, that's just where I started. So, I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences and.
