MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The 24th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education PRESENTS: DR. RONALD TAKAKI, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, CA America in a Different Mirror: A Comparative Approach to History 

00:00:00
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Thank you. Hello, good afternoon. 

00:00:25
STUDENTS Good afternoon. 

00:00:25
DR. RONALD TAKAKI Hey, isn't it more than a good afternoon, isn't this a great afternoon? Hey, isn't this a great funny day, huh? (laughing) But still for me, from California, it's burrrrr. (laughing). Oh boy, yeah, but it's so warm to be received by you and to be here at this Winter Roundtable. Now, Madonna, when you introduced me (laughing) you forgot to tell them something important about me and it's very important about me. As I stand here before you, I might look like a professor or even a philosopher, with my silver mane, huh? (laughing) Yes, but when I was a teenager growing up in Hawaii, I was not very academically inclined, maybe I was like some of you, but in Hawaii, (laughing) when I was a teenager, I was a surfer. You know, and I was a serious surfer. I had a nickname, my nickname was, "10-toes Takaki". (laughing) Imagine that, ah, my passion was to be able to hang 10 on the board when you're shooting that curl. Well, when my Berkeley students find out about Takaki's hidden past, they get very curious. How did a surfer become a scholar? Well, what happened was this. In 1956, wow, just think about that, huh. In 1956, I was a senior in high school and I had a teacher named Dr. Shunji Nishi, Ph.D. Let me honor Dr. Nishi by writing his name for you, okay, oops. 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:30
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, here we go. Okay, sorry about that. I got to get use to this. Okay, uhm, I remember walking into his class with my fellow students and all of us were impressed with Dr. Shunji Nishi, Ph.D. In Hawaii, this is 1956, there were other Asian-American doctors but there were all MD's, this one was a Ph.D. and I could remember going home and asking my mother a question, my mother who had been born on a plantation and who had only an eighth grade education. I said, "Mom, my teacher's name is Dr. Shunji Nishi, Ph.D. Mom, what's a Ph.D.?" And she looked at me and she said "I don't know, but he must be very smart." And I think a light went on in my head. Maybe someday, I could become "RONALD TAKAKI, Ph.D." (laughter). So I began studying hard for Dr. Nishi and Dr. Nishi made his students write essays every two weeks. For Dr. Nishi, to write is to think and so here I was scribbling these essays. They were short essays, one or two pages long but every two weeks, I had to turn in an essay and Dr. Nishi would write extensive, marginal comments on my essays and many of his questions were epistemological questions, Okay? Do you know epistemology? It's a good 50-cent word that I teach all of my Berkeley students. (laughing) E-pis-te-mo-lo- gy. Okay? (coughs) Ah, would somebody here like to define epistemology for us? 

00:04:40
STUDENT A study of knowledge. 

00:04:40
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  What? 

00:04:45
STUDENT A study of knowledge. 

00:04:45
DR. RONALD TAKAKI A study of knowledge. Hmm, that's still a little bit too broad, huh, come on somebody else, epistemology, huh? Yes? 

00:05:00
[sil.] 

00:05:00
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Yes. Oh, you're thinking of etymology, the, the study of the origins of... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
STUDENT No, e-epistle. 

00:05:10
DR. RONALD TAKAKI No, e-epistle, oh, letters. 

00:05:10
STUDENT Right. 

00:05:10
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Like, uhm, okay, I didn't think of it that way, you know. (laughing). Letters, knowing. 

00:05:20
STUDENT  Okay. 

00:05:25
DR. RONALD TAKAKI Who said that? Hey, you get an "A". (laughing). Okay, ah, you, you, you don't quite get it though. Okay, (laughing). But good enough. No, no, no, notice what she said. How do you know what you know? How? Okay and that's a keyword for epistemology. This is the Takakian working definition of epistemology. Epistemology is a critical thinking skill. It's a theory of knowledge. Epistemology, ask the question, "How do you know you know, what you know?" Okay you need another "How do you know you know what you know?" Okay? (laughing). Yeah, so in other words, the how of knowing something is more important than the what of knowing because how determines what you will know. Okay, so Dr. Nishi would ask me this epistemological questions and a relationship developed the two of us through his my, my essays and through his marginal comments. Well, in the spring semester and this is late in the spring semester. It was April. As I was walking across campus, Dr. Nishi flagged me. He said, "Ronald, Ronald, wait a minute, I have a question for you. Ronald, I think it would be good for you to go away for college, good for your personal growth and for your intellectual development. There's this fine liberal arts college in Ohio, called the College of Wooster, W-O-O-S-T-E-R. Would you like to go to the College of Wooster?" And I blurted out, "No, no, no," (laughing) Ohio, wow, that's so far away from Hawaii, huh? So I said, "No." And Dr. Nishi said, "Would it be okay if I wrote to the college, to tell them about you?" And I said, "Fine" and I walked away and I forgot completely about this conversation. (laughing) Well, a month later, I received a letter from the Dean of the College of Wooster and the letter read, "Dear Mr. Takaki, you've been accepted to the College of Wooster." (laughing) But please fill out the application form. Did I? This Dean hadn't seen my transcript yet and the thing about transcript is that its "grade point average," write GPA, so here during my senior year, I was getting A's, but still in terms of my grade point average, it was not 4.0, okay and that's the problem with schools, you know, looking at GPA, it does not give the school an accurate snapshot of the student at the time of applying for admission. I have a recommendation to this teacher's college, you know. Let's give heavier weight to the grades your received during your senior year. Don't you think that makes sense? Yes, this Dean hadn't received my SAT scores yet and my SAT scores were not outstanding but one thing we do know for certain about SAT scores, is that they correlate with family incomes. They rise together. Okay, so what happened? Well, I went to the College of Wooster. (laughing) Well, when I got there, I experienced a culture shock, yes. My fellow students at first semester, 1957, asked me questions like, "How long have you been in this country? Where did you learn to speak English?" Asian-American students today tell me they still get asked those questions. Underlying those questions, even if you're an immigrant, is the assumption that you're not an American. And to my fellow Wooster students, I didn't look like an American and I did not have an American sounding name. When I look back at my Wooster experience, I realize that it was not their fault. It was not to their fault that they could not and did not see me as American. Think about it. What have they learned in the curriculum about Asian-Americans in courses called United States History? They had learned nothing about Asian-Americans and they have learned nothing or very little about African-Americans, Chicanos and Native Americans. These Wooster students saw me through a filter, okay and I call this filter, I find in my thinking that it's helpful to give a name to something, isn't it, huh? I call this filter, The Master Narrative of American History, the Master Narrative of American History. And we're all familiar with this master narrative. It's a powerful pervasive story that this country was settled by European immigrants and that Americans are white or European in ancestry. But we can just look at ourselves in this room and know that not all of us came from Europe, okay? But the master narratives narrow definition of who is an American leaves many of us feeling left out, left out. I graduated from Wooster in 1961 and then I entered the Ph.D. program in American history at Berkeley. Berkeley and the 60s change my life. (laughter) I wouldn't be here had it not been just been for Berkeley but also the 60s. Hey, that was, you know, a politically vibrant era, uhm, decade and like thousands of Berkeley students, I was inspired by the moral vision of Martin Luther King and it became active in the civil rights movement and then came 1964. Remember 1964, Mississippi freedom summer. In that summer, three young civil rights workers were found murdered and buried in Mississippi. The news about the murders in Mississippi horrified me, 1964. And at that time I was looking around for a dissertation topic. And I know a lot of you remember those days, trying to find a dissertation topic and there are students here who are thinking, "Well, what about if I study for my dissertation?" So I was still looking around for a dissertation topic, and I decided that I wanted to understand the origins of this racial hatred and violence. So I decided just focus my dissertation on slavery that was 1964. Well, 1965, Watts exploded and some of us in this room can remember watching on black and white TV, the dark smoke rising to the skies above Los Angeles and hearing the gunfire and afterwards, looking down at Watts and seeing a burned out city, a bombed out city. Well, UCLA received to the wake-up call of the Watts rebellion. And in 1966, UCLA created a new position in the history department and announced to this new position, for a faculty member to teach UCLA's first black history course that was 1966. I was finishing my dissertation. I applied for that job. And guess what happened? UCLA, offered it to me. So I went down to UCLA to teach UCLA's first Black history class. Yes. (laughter) And you should have seen me at that time. I had a crew cut and I have black hair, if you can imagine that, huh. I was young. I was only 28 years-old. So I went to UCLA and you're totally wondering, Madonna, "What was it like for you, Professor Takaki, to teach UCLA's first black history course." Well, they scheduled this class to me in a huge auditorium with 500 seats in it and when I walked in, every seat was taken and students were even sitting in the aisles and there was a stage, stage at the front of the room with a podium. And when I walked in, there was a lot of chitter-chatter, you know, students were excited. UCLA's first black history course, so, and as I made my way to the front of the room, all of a sudden, a silence descended in the auditorium. (laughter) Their eyes where riveted on me. And I could just feel them, saying to themselves quietly, "funny, he doesn't, he look black," you know. (laughter) So, I got to the front of the room and, and I was really nervous, you know, my first job, my first course, my first lecture and so I got behind this podium like this and before I could say anything, this, hey, remember these were the days of black militants, you really, really know about them, you know, Madonna, yeah. (laughing) You know, black students wear their dashikis and have these afros, you know, ah, this tall black student in the middle of the room stands up and raises his hand and he says "Well, Professor Takaki, what revolutionary tools are we gonna learn in this class?" And I thought to myself, "This is not the way, I'm going to begin my career as a teacher." (laughter) And you probably wondered about how did I answer his question, huh. I think I said something like this. We're gonna study the history of the United States as it relates to Black people. We're also going to strengthen and sharpen our critical thinking skills and our writing skills and these can be revolutionary tools if you want to make it, make them so. But I had to do more. I found myself working with the Black students specially the militant ones. We had a few Black faculty at UCLA but they kept their distance from the black students. I had no choice, they were in my class. (laughter) So, I started working with them and I, I started befriending some of them and helped them organize into a Black Student Union, 1967, uhm, and the word went out to Black students of college campuses across the country, about this bad Asian dude (laughter) at UCLA organizing the BSU, you know, yeah. Uhm, so something else happened at UCLA, however. As I taught this course, I looked at the faces of my students and the majority of students had roots with, that went back to Europe, okay. This is, this was before affirmative action. Okay, 1967 but there were also students whose roots went back to Africa, to Mexico and to Asia. And this diversity that I witnessed led me to ask the question, "How do I know I know, what I know about the history of the diverse people of the United States of America?" And my pursuit for answers lasted for four decades and led to the writing of an abundance of books like Iron Cages, Race and Culture in 19th Century America, A Different Mirror, A History of Multicultural America and Strangers From a Different Shore, A History of Asian-Americans. Uhm, at this point, you're probably saying to yourself, "Professor Takaki, we like your idea of a more inclusive and a hence more accurate history of the United States but what does this history look like concretely? I know my students at Berkeley liked examples. What does your history look like concretely? What I'd like to do, is to give you a concrete example of how I do history, okay? I'd like to give you a history lecture, a short history lecture, a 15-minute lecture within a lecture. Okay? I'll give you, it's been a long time since maybe you've heard a history lecture but this one will be 15 minutes. But I want to show you how I do the teaching of diversity. Now, for this 15-minute lecture within a lecture, I'd like us to be interactive, as we have been already, you know, with the question of epistemology, you know. Ah, I'd like to be able to ask you questions and for you to give me some answers and then for us then to put together an analysis, an analysis, similarly, so the process will be an inductive one. Okay, where then, we can draw a conclusion, uhm, and history, Madonna, is really his story, right? Hey, how about her story change, huh? Yes, I see it on your faces. Yes, her story. (laughing). Ah, so let's look at this history from the perspective of the women, okay. I'd like to examine the 19th century. The 19th century was the making of modern multicultural America. And for this, ah, 15-minute lecture, lets examine two migrations, one across the Atlantic and then another across the Pacific, okay? So the first question. What group crossed the Atlantic in the 19th century, in large numbers and some of you are in this room because of this migration across the Atlantic, what group? 

00:19:40
STUDENT The Irish. 

00:19:40
DR. RONALD TAKAKI Irish, okay. Ah, let me write your answers down here. Okay, so the Irish. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:50
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  How many Irish came here during the 19th century? 

00:19:55
STUDENT (inaudible). 

00:19:55
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Huh? Ah, shout louder. Huh? 

00:20:05
STUDENT Four or five million. 

00:20:05
DR. RONALD TAKAKI Four or five million. Hey, that's pretty good. Yeah, I'll give you an A minus for that. (laughter) Yeah, four million came, four million came. Okay, what group crossed the Pacific and maybe some of us are in this room because of this migration, the Chinese. How many Chinese came over here? 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:30
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  You don't know? Hey, it's not your fault, you know. (laughter) 

00:20:35
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  What did you learn about the Chinese-Americans, huh, in courses called United States History, okay. I'm gonna have to tell you, about half a million. Okay, from the perspective of the worl, from the perspective of the women, women, what percentage of the Irish immigrants were women? (coughs) 47 percent? 

00:21:00
STUDENT Twenty-five percent. 

00:21:00
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Is it? (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
STUDENT Twenty-five percent. 

00:21:05
DR. RONALD TAKAKI Twenty-five percent? Okay, I didn't know it myself until I started to do research. That's why we do research, you know, and the number kind of surprised me, 52 percent. A high percentage of the Irish immigrants were women and these are young, these where young, unmarried women, 16 to 27 years of age, okay? So they're crossing the Atlantic coming to here. Okay, what percentage of the, ah, Chinese immigrants were women? Why? Five percent somebody said, five percent, okay, so this gives us then a static, the statistics we need to ask an analytical question. Why is it that so many of the Irish immigrants were women and why is it that so few of the Chinese immigrants were woman, okay? So we begin with the Irish migration. The Irish came over here because of the what? Okay, if you said potato famine, sorry to tell you this, you're actually wrong. (laughing) Yeah, ah, yes. Yeah, uhm. The potato famine lasted from 1850, 1844 to 1854 and one million Irish came here during that deadly decade, okay, but I said four million Irish came over here. A million came, before 1844 and two more million came after 1854. So it couldn't have been just the potato famine. To blame (ph) (ph)a blight is the master narrative of British history. Don't blame British imperialism, blame the blight. Okay, so why did so many Irish come over here? Well, even though I'm an American historian, I found myself doing readings deep into Irish history and this is what I learned. I learned that around 1,800 British colonial policy makers in London came up with a policy for Ireland. They decided that Ireland should become the supplier of beef to England, the supplier of beef to England. So they sent out an instructions to British protestant landlords in Ireland and these landlords, at this point, owned 90 percent of the island, okay? British colonialism had, had been underway for centuries now. So an entire people had been dispossessed of their own lands. (coughing) And so, these landlords then, began to transform agriculture in Ireland, to commercialize agriculture from tillage agriculture, small farming, potato farming agriculture to ranching agriculture, okay, raising of beef, okay. Uhm, and this economic transformation had gender significance. The men, this had led to the evictions of tens of thousands of Irish peasant farming families. The men were hired as wage earners, to work in the ranching economy. The women had been rendered economically superfluous and I'd like to write this word down, because it, it's a word that resonates to what's happening in our cities, specially the inner cities today, you know. These women had been rendered economically superfluous. They had no economic function in a ranching economy. In our tillage agricultural economy, they helped plant the potatoes and harvest the potatoes, okay, superfluous. Okay, so they came here and, uhm, a majority of them became maids, Irish maids, okay, right here in New York city, uhm, but I found out that one-third of them became factory workers. They left the farms to work in factories. Factories of Louisville, Boston, Providence, Fall River, Pawtucket and, uhm, I'm gonna draw a map here and this is gonna be spontaneously drawn, so, uh hmm, be generous, okay. (laughing) Also use your imagination. Sometimes it turns out, sometimes it doesn't. (laughing) So lets see what will happen today. Okay, so lets see, here we go. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:30
DR. RONALD TAKAKI  Hey, that's not too bad, huh. (applause) Here, where are we? We're, we're around here, huh, okay? Let see. (laughing) So, here's Lowell, Boston, Providence, Pawtucket, okay, so these Irish women are coming over here and they're working in these textile mills. Now, when I said textile, what exploded in your mind, about the raw material? What raw material where they processing? Cotton. Where did this cotton come from? Okay. Now, the textile industry was like, at this core of the industrialization of America. So now you have this tremendous demand for cotton in the south, from the south. And you have the expansion then of cotton agriculture into up country Georgia and South Carolina and to Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and Texas, okay. These were lands that had been inhabited by Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks and Chickasaws. Entire tribes were removed during the 1830s. This is the era of Indian removal and so these lands where put, stolen from these native peoples and lands then became lands for cotton agriculture. Cotton that was planted and harvested by enslaved African-Americans, okay? So I said cotton expanded into Texas, okay? Texas, at that time belonged to what country? Mexico, okay? So Americans were entering a foreign country, okay? They where crossing that border. Mexico, in 1830, passed a law, ah, declared that Americans may no longer enter Mexico, okay? Americans with names like Houston and Austin crossed that border. When you think about it, they where illegal immigrants, huh? (laughter) Right. They were bringing cottonseeds with them and enslaved African-Americans with them. In 1830, Mexico also declared that slavery was illegal in Mexico. So what did this slave owners do? They barricaded themselves in a mission and you will remember the Alamo, huh, 1836, that led to the war against Mexico and at the end of the war against Mexico, in 1848, the Unites States annexed half of Mexico, half of Mexico. Why did the United States go to war against Mexico? If you were living at that time reading the New York newspapers, you'd have learned that there was a border dispute between the United States and Mexico and James K. Polk sent troops into this disputed area and this American, US troops where attacked by Mexican troops and then Polk went to Congress and asked for a declaration of war, okay? Well now, historians have access to the papers of the James K. Polk administration. And we know for a fact now that political interest and business interest wanted a war against Mexico. Why? They wanted to take California. Why did they want to take California? Because they wanted a bay, the Bay of San Francisco to develop trade with Asia and this brings us then to the second part of the question about the Chinese immigrants, the migration across the Pacific, uhm, these Chinese immigrants came here, first for the gold rush and then to work on the trans-continental railroad. Ah, so they were building the line east. The Central Pacific Railroad had a workforce that was 90 percent Chinese, you know, that continent, trans-continental railroad, would not have been completed without Chinese labor. But the Union Pacific Railroad had a workforce that was largely Irish, okay? So here you have two immigrant workforces building this ribbon of steel across the face of America and they met in Promontory Point and the, the transcontinental railroad last lines where laid in 1869, okay? So this brings us to the ques, second question, why is it that so few of the Chinese immigrants were women? Well, there are many reasons why so few of them were women, okay? And I can only highlight one of them for you today, if you want to know about the other reasons, you gonna have to read my book, okay? (laughter) Yeah, Strangers From a Different Shore, ah, but, but one reason I want to highlight is the, what happened with the employers of Chinese laborers. These employers wanted Chinese men only, to come from China and work only temporarily. They were in effect guest workers, they were in effect brazeros(ph), okay? So here you have the Central Pacific Railroad bring, saying, "We want to hire these men, but we don't want these men bringing families with them." The superintendent of the Central Pacific Railroad, Charles Crocker said this, in testimony before Congress, he said, "We want these men to come here and work temporarily and then return to China," he said, "We do not want them staying with families and becoming," and he used this term, 'thick,' in America," okay? In this, in effect, this was the master narrative but it's shaping business policy, huh, so think about what's happening today with the Guest Worker Program, okay? What is it about this Guest Worker Program that allows workers to come here to work but not to stay, not to bring families with them but that was the, the view of employers regarding Chinese workers. Okay, so, hey, we did it, huh, 15 minutes. (laughter) See, and, and you could see where, huh, (applause) where the, uhm, the, the, the Irish and, and the Chinese experiences where different from each other but they were also connected and they are connected to what happened to Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws and African-Americans and Mexicans, okay? So, you can see that it's the economy that is bringing us all together, okay? And making for a diverse America, ah, but when I do diversity in my teaching, I don't just look at charts and statistics and maps. I also try to remember that these were men and women with minds and roles and voices, uhm. I try to write history from the bottom up, history through the stories and voices of everyday people. And so what I'd like to do now is to share some voices with you. I told you about the Irish women working with textile mills of Lowell. While, as they worked in these dark and dusty and noisy mills, they sang songs and historians have been gathering these songs and recording them and I'd like to share one song with you. I'm not gonna sing. (laughing) Well, I, I haven't had my glass of wine yet. (laughter) But, but listen to this song, okay? At Berkeley, I teach my students to listen between the lines, you know, you teach your students to read between the lines, huh? To see the deeper meaning of what you're reading. Well, listen for the deeper meaning of what you're hearing, okay? The song goes as, this way, " When I set out for Lowell, some factory fort to find. I left my native country and all my friends behind. But now I am in Lowell and summoned by the bell. I think of the, less of the factory than of my native dell." Notice if you're listening, you know, between the lines, between the lines. Yes, ah, that here, time has been redefined. It's no longer the movement of the sun but it's the clock. But it's not just the clock, it's a factory bell and what is a factory bell? What did it remind you of? The school bell, guess when the school bell was introduced at the same time by these broads of schools, who where the owners of these factories, who wanted to make sure that they taught their kids, immigrant kids, to pay attention to time. "The factory bell begins to ring and we must all obey and to our old employment rule or else be turned away." If you don't show up on time, you'll be fired, huh? But these women also possessed the spirit of resistance. The last stanza read, "Come all you, weary, weary factory girls, I have you understand. I'm going to leave the factory and return to my native land." Well, very few of these Irish women returned. They stayed here and they made a America a more diverse society in terms of, ah, religions. So, it was no longer a Protestant America. But what about the Chinese women, okay, and the Chinese immigrants? Well, I had trouble finding their voices. But in my research, I came across a slender stack of copies of Western Union telegrams that Chinese men were sending to each other. From the foothills of the Sierras to San Francisco, okay, dated in the 1870s and you've probably wondered, Professor Takaki, what did these Chinese men say to one another in these telegrams? You see, telegrams, Madonna, was state-of-the-art electronic communication. It's like Email today, you know, (laughs) yeah, ah, so Rebecca(ph), someday, you know, some historians can be looking at the Emails that you've sent me for this conference, huh, you know. (laughter) So, here we have a chance to take a glimpse into, ah, the eye level experience of Chinese immigrants in California. Uhm, these telegrams said different things. I can remember coming across one telegram that had one line only sent from a small town in the Sierras to San Francisco, 1874 and the one line read, "Send the opium up quick." (laughter) Oh. Yeah. I, I, I teach my students, "Hey, you know, that's a historical document, huh?" (laughing) You know, we, we need to like, read between the lines, figure out what this is saying. And, uhm, some students will say, well, Professor Takaki, you know, it was sent from a small town up in the Sierras. Ah, these are, these are men without women, okay? You know, ah, and they're lonely and they're working hard so they need opium, ah, to help them relax. And then other students would ask the epistemological question, you know, "How do you know you know what you know, huh?" "Why opium? Why not alcohol?" Okay? And all of a sudden, it dawns on them, opium, the British Opium Wars, the Treaty of Nanking 1842. So, these British pol, colonial policymakers who were making policies for Ireland were also making policies for India and China. At that time, England had a trade imbalance with China. You know about trade imbalances today, huh? Yeah. England was importing porcelain and soap and tea from China but it didn't have a product to ship to China. And so these British colonial policymakers said, decided to take opium from India and ship it to China and make a profit. The government of China said, "No, you may not export opium to this country," and England declared war in China and you had the British Opium Wars. And, ah, one of the wa, end of the wars, the Treaty of Nanking, ah, Great Britain annexed Hong Kong and as we know Hong Kong was only recently returned to China. So, that was, that one line, okay? But as I was going through these telegrams, I also came across the name, 'Fu Seng(ph)' several times. And I didn't pay too much attention about Fu Seng(ph) in the beginning. Fu Seng(ph) lived in Downieville. So, ah, there's San Francisco, there's Sacramento, there's Marysville, there's Downieville, okay? He's living in Downieville and, uhm, he, he was told that there was a woman named Men Tsu(ph), a Chinese immigrant woman living in Wadsworth, Nevada on the other side of the State line. So, he gets all excited. He wants to meet and to marry Men Tsu(ph), you know. You'd be excited too if (laughs) most of you were men, huh? So, I'm gonna just read to you these ex, these exchange of telegrams here. Ah, and these are telegrams in English. So, you can imagine a Chinese man going into a Western Union office. The message would be translated from Chinese into English and then would be sent sizzling over the wire. The first telegram, July 25th, 1874, he sends a telegram to Cao Chang(ph) in Wadsworth, Nevada. The telegram reads, "Don't you let her go. I will come tomorrow and see her. I want to bring her to Downieville to live with me. What time does the train start? Answer. Quick." You know, yeah, (laughs) You need to answer quick too if you were Fu Seng, huh? Yeah. There were very few Chinese women around. (laughs) So, he goes back to the Western Union office and sends another message to Chang(ph) the next day. The message reads, "I will start for Wadsworth today and tell her, tell her to wait for me to come. But then, he founds out, finds out, he has found out that there's another man. He said, "And if she wants to go with the other man, I will let her. Don't care." But then he does care 'coz he says, "Answer. Quick." Okay? (laughs) Yeah. Well, Men Tsu(ph) went away, went off, or, or she was taken away by this other man. So, I thought this is the end of this story. But then I came across, I'm reading these telegrams in chronological order. I came across a telegram dated August 12. Au Tang(ph) sends a telegram to Tinnue(ph) of Downieville. Telegram reads, "Fu Seng's(ph) woman has gone to Marysville." Wow! Men Tsu(ph), this is the woman, the Chinese immigrant woman who had been living in Wadsworth, Nevada is now in California, in Marysville. And Marysville is about 75 miles west of Downieville. So, Fu Seng(ph) gets all excited again. He has a friend living in Marysville. He sends a telegram to Sing Long(ph) in Marysville. Telegram reads, " Bring woman up. (laughs) Right away. Will pay $300." Oh, that's a lot of money at that time, you know. Answer. And but then he said, "What about the other man? Is man who took woman there? Answer. At 11:05 am the same day, Sing Long(ph) wires Dai Yu Ing(ph) in Downieville. Tell Fu Seng(ph), Men Tsu(ph) is here. What you going to do? Answer. Quick!" (laughs) So, Fu Seng(ph) had found the woman. But, the question is would Men Tsu(ph) agree to marry him? At 4:20 PM, the same day, Sing Long(ph) telegram, telegraphs Fu Seng(ph). She wants you to come right away and get warrant with officer. Friends will help. You don't be afraid, we will get her sure." (laughs) So, Fu Seng(ph) rushes to Marysville. In August 15th, he wires Dai Yu Ing(ph) still back in Downieville, I saw the woman but have not yet taken her. Send marriage certificate. Immediately, his friend responds, "We'll send the certificate next day." Okay, now. Who is this Men Tsu(ph), this woman? We don't know who she was. That's all the evidence we have. What was she doing in the United States? Well, if we look at the census for, California for 1870, this is what we would learn, that 70 percent of the Chinese women in California identified as their occupation, prostitution. In other words, they had been forced to come to America. And then when they landed they had to sign indentured papers to pay for their passage. And they had to enter into sexual and indentured servitude, okay? That was 1870. This is 1874, so Men Tsu(ph) may have been one of those women forced into sexual indentured servitude. She had worked to offer, worked to offer indenture and now was free and she decided that she wanted to stay in America. Who is Fu Seng(ph)? Well, we don't know who he was. But, again, the railroad was completed when, 1869. This is 1874, five years later. If he had come here to work on the railroad, he did not go back to China. He stuck around. And you can just imagine Fu Seng(ph) saying, "Maybe, I don't want to go back to China. Maybe I want to stay in America. Maybe I'd like to make America my home. Maybe I'd like to become Chinese-American." And in the footsteps of Fu Seng(ph) would come others, my grandfather from Japan, noodles that come from Korea, the Philippines, India. They would also come from Italy, Hungary, Poland and Russia. And they would be forced to come here from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Afghanistan and if you just listen, you can hear them in, in our taxis, in our hotels, in our restaurants, in our school buildings, in our business offices, our high-tech offices saying to themselves, " Maybe, maybe, maybe I'd like to make America my home." But in order for us to hear them, we first have to become listeners. And this is where I'd like to end tonight, today, ah, because you've been great listeners, interactive listeners even willing to give me wrong answers. (laughs) But, but that's okay. It's not your fault, huh. Yeah. (laughs) But, hey, once you know how and what you need to know, then it does become your fault. And if you don't teach your students this, it does become your fault, okay? So, ah, thank you for listening to the song of the Irish women. Thank you for listening to the telegrams of Fu Seng(ph). Thank you for listening to my 15-minute lecture within a lecture. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (applause)
