SUE JOHNSON Hi, everybody. Can you hear me? Oh, well, that’s not a very good start. Now, you can hear me, yes. Uhm, hi, it’s an honor to be here. Uhm, I come from snowy Canada. So, I did expect it to be just a little bit warmer here, but never mind, it’s nice to be here. Anyway, at least, you don’t have to go outside and shovel the snow, at least don’t have to do that here. So, I’m going to talk to you about couple therapy in the 21st Century. And what I’m gonna tell you is that from my point of view, couple therapy will be more and more in demand in the 21st Century. It will be more and more on target and effective. It will be more tied to the science of love and bonding. It will be more integrated into mental and physical healthcare. It will be more effective at addressing key relationship wounds that destroy trust in a relationship, uhm, and that now decimate relationships and last but not least, it will be sexier. This has to be good, yes. We seem to have decided in our society that for something to be sexier, it just has to be -- it has to be good. Couple therapy, as a modality, emerged at a result of public demand for professional health with relationship problems. This makes sense. The majority of North Americans report that having a lasting, loving relationship is their main life goal. And as we start to understand how important the quality of that relationship is for our mental and physical health, that makes more sense than ever. We also rely on our love relationships more and more. In fact, with longer hours, bigger commutes, time spent online, for many of us, I’m gonna suggest you, our love relationship is our tribe, our village and often times our whole social life. We are lonelier and lonelier in North America. Survey after survey finds that we have fewer and fewer people to confide in. In addition, long-term relationships are no longer based on economic necessity. Love and satisfaction are the platform on which our families, our main source of human connections, stand awful. This is very different than in, say, 1957, when they asked a survey of women to rank love in the reasons for marriage. It came fifth. Very interesting, uhm. No wonder then, if you think about this, that it’s in demand that we’re understanding more and more how crucial it is that 70% of mental health professionals now report that they offer couple interventions. The need to understand and to be able to shape our most important adult relationships is tangible and growing. And this is occurring in spite of all the pessimistic pronouncements that monogamy is impossible and that we are genetic philanderers; I love that phrase, genetic philanderers. It sounds sort of exotic, uhm. If this is true, we are also psychotic philanderers, since most of us spend our lives with one partner and if this relationship ends, we find another partner as soon as possible. However, I think, it is true that to make monogamy work, we need to know how love works and how to shape it with a particular partner. And compared to even 15 years ago, I’m gonna suggest you, we do know how to do this. Couple therapy is becoming more and more focused on key variables. It’s becoming more on target and more tied to science. In the past, couple interventions have been labeled as a bag of tricks. Couples therapy still gets a very poor showing in the media, I think. We are made fun of an awful lot of the time. A bag of tricks, accused to focusing on the symptoms of distress without any real understanding of love relationships and how to restructure those relationships in any significant lasting way. For many years, therapists focused on reducing conflict, things like teaching negotiation. And, I guess, it does help to fight in a -- a nicer way, to learn to make compromises, I’ll do more cooking, you do the yard, but this does not take us to the heart of the matter. You cannot negotiate the defining features of a human bond for tenderness, for compassion, for emotional responsiveness or sexual desire for a felt sense of connection. McCay made the point 10 years ago that couple therapy had focused in -- on almost everything, except the creation of love and nurturance. I think, we are now moving beyond a focus on symptoms moving beyond, as one clinician put it to me, moving beyond moving the chairs around on the deck of the Titanic; very powerful image. We know how to go to the heart of the matter now. And it’s worth stating -- I’m a very passionate couple therapist. I feel like I learn from every couple I see. It’s worth stating that couple and family therapists operate in perhaps what is the most powerful transforming arena offered by the field of psychotherapy. In the complex, multi-layered drama that unfolds in a couple therapists' office, the most powerful longings, the most positive motivators for change, are up and running. The blocks to integrated, balanced, flexible functioning are clear and the roots to powerful corrective emotional experiences to individual and relationship change open up. In a session, I watch partners shift their inner-realities, their habitual ways of regulating emotion and the key signals that they send to loved ones are pivotal moments of fear and need. I watch whole dances, whole new dances spin from a single thread of a new emotional message and these dances then shift how partners think, feel and engage with each other. In couple therapy, partners change each other. And who has more impact on -- on -- on us than those we love? No one. For example, I remember a very particular case that moved me very much a few years ago, when a Vietnam vet -- I was supervising this case, a Vietnam vet, well, it happened a long time ago, who tells his wife that he has lived in shame every day since that war, that he lives in a dark pit of shame. And the therapists -- the therapist he goes to have a tiny little 20-watt light bulb to shine into that dark pit of shame. When he turns and tell his -- tells his wife what he did in nam and she turns and tells him, “You’re my man. You’ve always been my man. You’re a good man. You’ve did do those things in nam and you’ve paid for it every day of your life. Will you please come and be with me? I need you to come and be with me. You’re my man, you belong to me. Put your weapons and your dreams and your nightmares down and be with me.” When she says that to him, he -- for one moment, he is not in that shining pit of shine -- of shame and afterwards he said to me, “It’s like she has a stadium floodlight to shine into that pit of shame.” That’s very fascinating and I wasn’t gonna talk to you about that, but anyway, let me get back. Science is helping us understand how love goes wrong. The key elements in the dance that unfolds in our couple sessions and the emotions are the music of this dance. One emotional signal from a partner, from an attachment figure, a shift in the tone of voice, a lift of an eye brow can, says the work of brain scientist Jaak Panksepp, spark primal panic in the other partner’s amygdala and begin the deadly dance of attack and withdrawal, a dance of despair that regularly poisons marriages and families. This primal panic is carried in a special pathway, reserved in the mammalian brain for the danger signal that we are disconnected from a key attachment figure that we are cost loose, alone, without safe haven, without a secure bond. This panic floods us, scrambles the signals we send to our partner, mixing rage and fearful appeals for care for example and narrows down our steps in the dance, narrows it down to such old favorite size, I demand in point, you distance and turn away, I demand more. I call this dance the Protest Polka. One person is protesting distance and disconnection and the other is trying to avoid rejection and shame. This panic easily overwhelms us, especially, if we cannot even name what is happening to us and makes access to empathy for the other person or skillset for negotiation impossible. What we do in emotionally focused couple therapy or EFT is to help people grasp and deal with this fear of disconnection in a positive way that promotes mutual responsiveness and bonding. Emotion is the music of the dance of love. We believe that it’s best to tune into that music rather than trying to find behavioral or cognitive solutions. To change the emotional music is the most powerful and often the only way to really change the negative dance of couple distress. If we know about panic, as part of the music of the dance of love when it goes wrong, what about other powerful positive emotions and interactions that are etched into our mammalian brain? Couple therapists need not only to halt negative interactions that fuel emotional isolation, but also to scaffold key relationship defining positive interactions and emotions. In our model of couple therapy, we look at key change events in therapy sessions that predict recovery from relationship distress at the end of therapy and we see a positive interaction that we call a softening, where a previously blaming partner can now ask for his or her attachment needs to be met in a way that pulls their partner closer. The other person has now become more responsive and engaged over the course of therapy, so that the point of this softening, this risk-reach event, both partners are accessible and responsive. They can then initiate what we call a Hold Me Tight bonding conversation. This soft attachment oriented conversation is an essential dance step. The procedural protocol for which securely-bonded partners’ parents and children, loved ones know how to use. This kind of conversation creates a safe haven, a secure bond. This is the kind of conversation that allows for safe, expansive engagement with one’s own experience and with someone else. Just to give you a feel where this science is going and how it’s supporting intervention, my colleague, Jim Coan, him and I are now doing a study together, did an MRI study, where what he found was that the touch of a loving partner’s hand changed how women’s brains responded to the threat of having electric shock on their feet. It changed whether their brain lit up in panic or whether it did not and it changed how much pain they felt when they were shocked. This is the touch of a hand, this is a long way from hallmark cards and sentimentality. The power of the touch of someone we love. The partner’s touch calm the jittery neurons in the women’s brains, a felt sense of emotional connection changes how our brains encode danger, not just code with engager, encode danger and allows us to use our sense of connection with a loved one as a protection, a safety cue. The bonds of love are an ancient survival security code. And now, I want to show you a beautiful, little YouTube clip that just gives you a feel for what I mean. I want you to look at this, it’s just two minutes long and I also want you to look at the faces, the emotional expression on the faces of the people at the end of the clip. Can we have the first clip, please?

SUE JOHNSON Right. So, what I’m saying is that your -- the quality of your love relationships is your seat belt, perhaps it’s the only one you will ever have while you are on this planet. The EFT therapist, guided by the research on adult attachment and by this kind of neuroscience, has a structured guide to the creation of bonding events in the therapy room that change how partners perceive and reach for each other and respond to their partner. A therapist will help a partner engage more deeply and articulate their attachment fears and needs and will structure safe enactments when these fears and needs -- where these fears and needs are owned, distilled and sent in a clear coherent way to the partner and then helps the partner respond to that. The reason we can do this is not because we are clever or magical or incredible therapists in our interventions, but because we are tapping into the most potent instinct longing in our nature and the dressing the deepest need we have for love and connection with another human being. John Bowlby, the father of attachment theory, the framework for the new signs of love, stated that the most basic instinct in man was not sex and not aggression, it was this, I’m gonna show you a picture. A surgeon operates on -- in children in utero and he said this moment changed his life. He was operating on a child in its mother’s womb and while he was doing it, this little hand came out of the mother’s womb and what it did is it grabbed onto his finger and it refused to let go. And the surgeon said what he understood was, that this was not a fetus, this was a little being and its most basic need of all was to reach for an -- for contact with another being and hold on. And that’s what John Bowlby basically said that the most basic instinct in our being is to connect, to connect with another being. The need for connection for an emotional response for another, we need a positive answer to the key question in relationships, “Are you there for me?” If the answer to this question is, yes, the research says you can deal with all kinds of differences, repair disconnections and injuries and you can use your communication skills flexibly. The fact that we tap into this basic survival bonding system is also, I believe, one of the reasons why we don’t seem to have a problem with relapse in EFT. Once you know how to reach and connect, you do it again and again, creating more and more safe connection and positive emotion. The new science is in many key respects stand in the field of couple therapy on its head. The main problem that couple therapy was always focused on was conflict. This new research says that there is a sense in which the main problem is distance and disconnection and the panic this triggers. Life -- love relationships are defined by emotional responsiveness. Emotional presence and responsiveness is different from physical presence or instrumental support. A classic problem in relationships is that one person is earnestly offering advice on problem solving, while the other is dying of emotional isolation. They miss each other. Gottman finds that stonewalling, a freeze on emotional responsiveness predicts divorce. Ed Tronick, working with mothers and infants finds that when the mother goes still and silent, all babies of all temperaments in all cultures go berserk, but I don’t have to tell you guys this. You see what happens to regular, well-functioning normal adults when their mate withdraws from them and shuts them out. The withdrawing partner usually has no idea the impact they are having at this point, but the attachment oriented therapists sees it clearly. I’m going to show you another little clip with Ed Tronick, it's from YouTube again, talking about still face. I, particularly, want you to look at the baby here.

00:20:20
EDWARD TRONICK Babies this young are extremely responsive to the emotions and the reactivity and the social interaction that they get from the world around them. This is something that we started studying 30, 40 years ago when people didn’t think that infants could engage in social interaction. 

00:20:45
The “Still Face” 

00:20:45
Experiment 

00:20:45
EDWARD TRONICK In the still face experiment, what the mother did was she sits down and she's playing with her baby, who's about a year of age. And she gives a greeting to the baby, the baby gives a greeting back to her. This baby starts pointing at different places in the world and the mother is trying to engage her and play with her. They’re working to coordinate their emotions and their intentions what they want to do in the world and that’s really what the baby is used to. And then we ask the mother to not respond to the baby. The baby very quickly picks up on this and then she uses all of her abilities to try and get the mother back. She smiles at the mother, she points because she's used to the mother looking where she points. The baby puts both hands up in front of her and says, “What’s happening here?” She makes that screechy sound at the mother like “Come on, why aren’t we doing this?” Even in this two minutes, when they don’t get the normal reaction, they react with negative emotions, they turn away, they feel the stress of it, they actually may lose control of their posture because of this stress that they’re experiencing. 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN Okay, I am here and what are you doing? Oh, yes, oh, what a good girl! 

00:22:35
EDWARD TRONICK It’s a little like the good, the bad and the ugly. The good is that normal stuff that goes on that we all do with our kids. The bad is when something bad happens, but the infant can overcome it, after all, when you stop the still face, the mother and the baby start to play again. The ugly is when you don’t give the child any chance to get back to the good. There’s no reparation and their stuck in that really ugly situation. 

00:23:10
SUE JOHNSON I’m gonna suggest you that the -- 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN  Babies – 

00:23:15
SUE JOHNSON That the ugly is where your couples are stuck, where they come into your office and that’s why they’re in so much pain. The solution to this problem is to teach the baby, that’s all of us, to teach the baby how to reach and the mother had to respond in a way that restores connection, to show the participants in the drama how to be effectively dependent. Our fields has been quite obsessed with being inter-dependent, phrases like individuation, you know, differentiation. We’re talking about effective dependency here. Alternatively, if you cannot reach in connects, then as Ed Tronick was saying on that, uh, little piece of DVD, you inevitably end up moving into anger, angry control, if you’re an adult, reactive rage or norming self-protection into the steps of the demand-withdraw Protest Polka and ever-widening cycles of emotional starvation and isolation. This clip ended with joyful, uh, reconnection. We find that positive -- powerful intense positive emotions in key sessions of EFT undo old hurts, shift perceptions promote new responses, coherent appeals for care evoke tenderness, spark new compassionate responses, shift perspectives, so that a long-time partner is suddenly seen in a new way. And let’s talk a little bit about neuroscience, speaking of positive, how about calm, blissful contentment? The -- I am right where I want to be feeling, when you feel that what you’re usually -- often feeling is a little spurt of oxytocin. The new neuroscience of bonding tells us that this hormone found only in mammals, who, uhm, is -- found only in mammals who bond and stay close to their mates. It’s being called the molecule of monogamy and in the language of, uhm, English working class, where I come from, it’s one powerful little sucker of a hormone. Oxytocin deactivates the amygdala, the threat detector, which I’ve told my husband is why, when I used to fly alone a lot and I hate flying, I used to listen to his voice in my head when the plane took off. It -- it works, actually works, guys, it’s better than Ativan. It turns off your threat detector and it turns on the reward centers in your brain, dopamine. So, people are talking about it now as the neuro-chemical basis of romantic love. We’ve known for a long time that we are flooded with it at orgasm or when we breast-feed, but now it appears that it’s released when we are simply close to people we love and even thinking about someone you love triggers a little rush of this hormone. If you give humans a shot -- a shot of oxytocin, it increases their tendency to trust to turn towards others. So, this is a reflection of the world we live in. I get a proposal in the mail for oxytocin-enhanced EFT. A Swiss pharmaceutical company has now put oxytocin in a nasal spray coming to a pharmacy near you soon. Is the future of couple therapy in the 21st Century to be placed via nasal spray? I don’t think we need to worry. We don’t need a pill or a nasal spray and that’s what I told the -- this company. We are learning to create the interactions that turn on this body chemistry as part of the process of therapy when someone is gazing at their lover rather when they are stuffing things on their nose, right. Can you imagine the couple saying, some one person says, “I love you,” and the other person says, “That’s just the oxytocin talking.” It’s not -- it’s not gonna work, okay. I believe that when we get what we call a softening, bonding events in EFT that predict recovery from distress that clients are flooded with this hormone, maybe we can do that in our next research project. New research says that oxytocin also improves mind-reading, understanding of the emotional messages and facial expression, especially if those expressions are ambiguous. This is important, because if you think about it, many, many messages in love relationships are just that, they are ambiguous, they require decoding. If you don’t think so, try decoding, I’m too tired for sex tonight. We decide if this means I am tired or if it means I am tired of you or if this means this is the end of your sex life forever. The mind-reading study by Domes says that oxytocin promotes the deeper processing and more accurate translation of social cues. One of the key messages of this new science that speaks to the focus of couple therapy is the message that emotion is fast, powerful and pre-eminent in organizing close relationships. How you regulate your emotion and how you engage with loved ones are two sides of the same coin. For many years, couple therapy systematically avoided dealing with emotion. This is like leaving the peanut butter out of a peanut butter sandwich. This is now changing. Research on change factors in psychotherapy is consonant with the emerging research on emotion and bonding in our results in EFT. For example, the alliance with the therapists and the clients’ emotional experiencing predict success in -- in CBT better than the stipulated key ingredient of CBT, which is a focus on distorted cognitions. We know that across types of treatment, depth of experiencing, emotional intensity has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of psychotherapy outcome. Emotion research tells us that the main function of emotion, apart from communicating with others, is to help us make meaning to decide what is relevant to inform us about what we need in order to move us toward what we need. I -- from my point of view, one of the key things you have to be able to do to have a loving bond is know what you need and be able to clearly state that to your partner. The old idea of a corrective emotional experience as a key mechanism of change makes more sense than ever. We also know that it matters how you work with emotion. In the large NIMA study of depression across models of intervention, therapists who use collaborative rather than coaching approaches to working with emotion got better results. Better therapists are surrogate information processors and process consultants rather than coaches. To move into my next theme, as science continues to explicate how partners regulate each other’s physiology and behavior, the place of couple interventions in the health system will become more and more accepted. We already know that secure connection is amazingly good for us. It makes us healthier, less likely to get depressed, more able to heal wounds, it keeps our immune system humming, our blood pressure down. So we are two to three times less likely to - to suffer strokes or heart attacks if we have positive connection with another person. Secure folks have a more coherent positive sense of self, they deal traumatic experience better. Chris Frailey looked at 9/11 survivors and he found that those with secure attachments, who could turn to others and access their need for nurturing and comfort, could ask for it and rest in that comfort, recovered very well from their trauma compared to those who were more insecure and could not do that. What would these kinds of integrated interventions looks like? Let me just give you five that are already happening. Couples work increases the effectiveness of - of addiction treatment. You turn to your partner for comfort instead of your drug. That's already clear in the literature. Our study suggest that couple interventions such as EFT positively impact PTSD symptoms and break the cycle of symptoms triggering relationship distress, which in turn then the relationship distress trigger symptoms, right? We know that couple therapy impacts depression. Depression is a natural response to a felt sense of ongoing rejection and abandonment. An educational couples program for faster secure connection is being developed by one of my colleagues for heart attack patients and their partners to speed healing and reduce the likelihood of a second heart attack. And in my institute in Ottawa, one of my wonderful colleagues has developed a program that she's been using for many years, we work actively with stroke couples in our institute. We've developed a form of EFT that we do with the speech therapist with simplified cues for stroke couples to help couples deal with aphasia. These are just some of things that are coming that integrate couple interactions with the health system. It's worth noting here that in general, pain is made up of emotional and physical components. And the links between so-called social and physical pain are becoming much and much clearer. Our species need for social connection shaped our underlying neural make up. The threat of rejection shares the same neural circuitry as physical pain. So love hurts, literally. And in the field of couple therapy, some wounds are deadly. We know how to help couples address hurts, distance and habitual negative patterns. Our research says that seven out of ten couples who go through EFT move out of the distress zone. But what about relationship traumas such as affairs, bonding betrayals, when someone turns away just when you need them the most? Can we move these couples through forgiveness into reconciliation and the renewal of trust? Let's be clear here, for the active couple therapist, forgiveness is the booby prize. What you want is forgiveness that translates into the ability to trust again. The answer to, can we move these couples through from our point of view is, yes. Um, our latest research study found very positive results and those results were stable at three year follow-up. If you focus where it counts on the emotion, the attachment meaning of the injuries and the creation of corrective bonding interactions. We've learned a lot here from these wonderful couples. For example, what is the difference between an apology that works and one that falls flat? For an apology to lift me out of my pain and to move me to take a leap of faith and trust again I need to understand to feel and speak the essence of my pain to you directly and when I look into your eyes, I need to see to have a felt sense, to have felt sense, and we could talk about mirror neurons here, let's not do that, that my pain hurts you. That you feel it, that you care about it, that you feel my sadness, shame, that you feel sadness, shame and regret when you see my pain. Then I need as a therapist to help the couple make a restorative antidote move, I ask you to respond to the attachment needs triggered by the event and this time you get it and you can respond to the person you've injured offering what Harry Harlow called contact comfort. We then have the beginnings of a secure bond again. And last but not least, and I'm doing very well with my time, hey! That means I can show you, um, a little -- my piece at the end, which is eight minutes long, so that's good. I don't know if we're supposed to have questions, but perhaps if we have some extra time we can. Last but not least, couple therapy is getting sexier. The fields of couple therapy and sex therapy are becoming more integrated. The latest edition of the journal of couple and marital therapy have an article by myself and one of my colleagues in it talking about this, if you're interested. This makes ultimate sense. The limits of treating the genitals alone are clear. The success of sensate focus and sexual stimulation techniques have been found to be determined by couple ratings of communication prior to treatment. It seems to me that we treat problem symptoms in isolation, mostly because we do not have an integrating framework that captures the whole and links elements and identifies key organizing factors. If we consider that there are three basic elements to adult relationships, attachment, care giving and sexuality and that attachment as an emotion regulation system is the frame and the platform for sexuality as Mae West said, "Sex is emotion in motion". I know I would have liked her, she's said some really amazing things. If we consider what I just said seriously then, attachment offers us an integrating relational framework for the couple therapist who is working with cycles and blocks in a couple sexual relationship. Bonding and mating go together in mammals. Avoidantly attached partners who are uncomfortable with closeness and shutdown attachment needs, research tells us they prefer one night stands and in sexuality, they focus on sensation and performance. In my book, Hold Me Tight, I call this sealed-off sex. It's one dimensional. James Bond is a good example. He needs -- every two minutes he needs a new car, a new gun and a new lady. In this sex, you do indeed need more and more novelty to keep the fire of sexuality burning. More anxiously attached partners tend to prefer what I call solace sex. They see intercourse as a proof of love. And they focus on cuddling and being desirable to their partner. These folks tell the therapist that, this is a gentlemen in my office two weeks ago, "If only my partner would make love to me every day, and have orgasms every time then everything would be alright in this relationship, because I would know she desired me". His partner is lying on the floor with exhaustion just at the thought of it. More securely attached partners are more able to be confident and relaxed in sex, to talk about sexual blocks and problems, to be open to erotic exploration and to be able to say -- to surrender to sensation in lovemaking, they move into what I call synchrony sex where play, eroticism and closeness can come together. Oxytocin, the cuddle hormone also interacts with dopamine by the way here to block habituation receptors in the brain. Isn't that interesting? Perhaps then practice and emotional presence fosters lasting passion and yes it can last. Laumann study, Sex in America, tells us that those of us who are happy in long-term relationships have more frequent and more satisfying sex. Okay. Attachment science then gives us a positive model of sexuality, a goal to aim for besides the Hollywood images of instant and simultaneous orgasm. So I have now addressed the five topics I named at the beginning of the talk, so what I'd like to do now is I'd like to show you an eight minute clip from the Hold Me Tight marriage education DVD. It's based on the book, Hold Me Tight. You're gonna see Mary Lee talking about her experience in her 28-year old marriage. She is disorganized by her anxiety. And she handles her fear by withdrawing, which constantly triggers her husband John's panic and keeps their dance of isolation going. This is no solution insecurity. This is a limbic tango. This is the perpetual problem in close relationships. For me there is only one perpetual problem that is the inability to safely connect. This is from the new DVD that we made as part of the EFT relationship education program and this couple called their negative cycle, the nothing. I'm gonna just tell you that 'cos then you'll understand Mary Lee better when you see her. Mary Lee feels frustrated and lonely, but she doesn't think she should feel that way, because she is supposed to be independent, not needy and she doesn't know how to talk about it, she doesn't even have words for it, so she sort of fumes. She's just upset, she doesn't know why. Her husband comes up from the basement and he says to her, "What's wrong?". And Mary Lee says, "Nothing! Nothing!". And he says, "Yes, there is. Why won't you ever talk to me?". And she says, "No! No! There's nothing wrong". So they call their cycle, the nothing. The other thing about that one is they told me when they came into our project to make this movie that they're an emptiness couple and their kids kept 'em together and now the kids have left, they have nothing. Okay? So she's thinking of leaving and so is he. Here you're gonna see them moving into be able to talk about their attachment fears and needs in a way that create safe haven connection. You're mostly gonna see her doing that, because this is a short clip. You're gonna see Mary Lee talking to her partner John about the disorganizing panic that fuels her withdrawal. And then you will see a piece of the Hold Me Tight conversation where she shares fears and needs. I'm showing you this, because I'm making the point that it is easy to miss and our field has missed in the past. It is easy to miss the basic plot of the drama of attachment to stay on the surface and to miss the leading element, the emotions and the dance of connection and disconnection that defines a love relationship. From my perspective, we did this for many years and we don't have to do it anymore. We can have many other functional elements in our relationship and still not be able to find and shape the love we need. We have to know how to go to the heart of the matter. Let's look at Mary Lee and John. 

00:43:05
The Zing of 

00:43:05
Attachment Panic 

00:43:05
MARY LEE If I perceive a comment or a look or any sort of response that you give me as being critical, I automatically jump back to the times when I was, um, younger and when I was struggling with all sorts of other issues and, you know, having to stay in after school and all that sort of stuff. So I - I automatically go back there and then I assume that you are, you know, being really critical of me or that I'm not good enough and I don't - and I can't get up to meet your expectations and I can't be your equal. And, um -- and then I get -- and then that when I get up and get those feelings going and I -- it's all happening in a nanosecond that these things are boiling up in there, that I -- that reinforces me feeling really bad about myself again. And then that's when I have to protect myself, that's when I sorta withdraw and I turtle and I just sorta hide in my shell and I just wanna stay there. So then when you come in and say, nothing, or ask me, and I say, nothing, then that's -- then you get mad or I'm afraid you'd get mad and then I'm -- and then I'm also frightened that what I have been thinking is coming true that I'm not good enough for your or I'm not -- I can't meet those expectations. And because I -- you know I hold your esteem really high and I wanna stay there you know? So. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN So the idea of losing that esteem, that's -- this is hard to talk about, right, Mary Lee? Is this hard to talk about, it's painful? 

00:45:10
MARY LEE Yeah. So I want to, um, -- so that's why I pretend myself. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN And you used to the word fear, right? And you said, you're telling John that it may look like I'm shutting you out and that I'm saying nothing, but actually underneath I'm afraid. 

00:45:25
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN That's what you're telling him, I'm afraid and overwhelmed with this idea that I can't find the right words. 

00:45:30
MARY LEE And I -- and I also am frightened that if I -- if I do, um, let go a lot of things and I go overboard as well and you will get angry too at me, but I will get -- I'll go overboard and then I don't know, then I'm also not in control of the situation, so this is another way that I can control what maybe the reaction. You know, so I -- that's. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN So it might looked like John's coming and he knows there's something wrong and he is saying, "What's wrong?", but there's a sort of urgency in his what's wrong and for you, all this happens in that nanosecond, when he says what's wrong, right? 

00:46:15
MARY LEE Right. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN All this old feeling of being young and not being confident and all these feelings happened just like that. 

00:46:25
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN And you get afraid? 

00:46:30
MARY LEE I get -- yeah, I get frightened of it and I'm -- I'm overwhelmed with it as well, because I'm trying to -- to control it and I'm trying to organize my thoughts and I can't organize my thoughts and then I wanna be -- I wanna make sure I articulate everything properly and I can't do that, because I can't get my thoughts clear enough and I can't -- and then when you say, what's the use, then I think oh, okay, then that reinforces it again. You know and I'm not even conscious that I'm doing this. This is all just going on without me even figuring out that this is going on. So I am just -- you know just sort of protecting myself and hiding out, but I don't -- I don't understand that, because I feel safe with John for everything, you know? Like John has always been my white knight and he's protected me so many other times. And you know, so I don't understand why I wouldn't be able to say this to John during that, because I don't ever -- I would never ever think that I would be frightened with John. Then the zing happens, so it's also that oh, I am not -- not only I'm not gonna find the words and do it correctly is that's -- I'm not going to be worth it. I'm not gonna be worth you working at getting me to come out and talk about this. I'm not gonna be and in fact I'm not even going to be worth it for friends and I'm not even going to be, you know, worth it to... 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN For anyone. 

00:48:30
MARY LEE For anyone. So then I get really, really lonely and stuff. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN That's a hard, hard... 

00:48:35
MARY LEE That's my big, big ghost. 

00:48:40
JOHN Huge. 

00:48:40
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN So if I can't come out and find a way to be with you, which I don't seem to be able to and I see that I'm frustrating you, the fear is that you're gonna give up, right? I'm not going to be worth it, nobody is gonna work that hard to get to me. 

00:48:50
MARY LEE That's right. And -- and not just that they're not gonna work that hard to get to me is that when you get to me, you're not gonna like what you see. So that's another. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Right, because I -- in the beginning you talked about, 'cos I'm not as verbal as you and I'm not as articulate as you and then so you're gonna have to work hard to get to me and then you're not gonna like it. 

00:49:15
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN And that's a horrible feeling, right? 

00:49:20
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Could you tell John what that feels like? 

00:49:20
MARY LEE It's -- I just did. That's really scary. That's really scary and it's really lonely and um... 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN I think you used the word despair. 

00:49:35
MARY LEE Yes, yes despair and loneliness is a big thing there. So... 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN What do you -- in that space, when you're right caught in that, when you're -- when that zing has got you by the throat, right? How can he help you? Can you tell him what you need at that moment, Mary Lee? 

00:49:55
MARY LEE I need you to be soft and gentle and just to sort of reach out and just let me know that that I'm worth it, that I will be worth it. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN That you're precious to him, right? 

00:50:10
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:50:10
JOHN But how do I -- how do I or how does a person know that you're there. I mean, do I ask her, do I guess or do I... 

00:50:20
MARY LEE No, I'm -- you can't take that away from me that I need to be able to ask to tell you. I need to be able to let you know because if you take it away from me then it becomes your issue and not my issue and I need it to still be my issue because I need to -- I need that, I need to be able to tell you. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. So you have to be able to -- it's empowering for you, right? You have to be able to find the words and that's what we're doing here, right? 

00:50:55
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN You have to be able to make it explicit, right? 

00:51:00
MARY LEE That's right. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN 'Cos I think one of the things between you guys is you've said we've sort of touched on some of these things, but we've never been able to really... 

00:51:05
JOHN We've been all around this kind of a conversation for 28 years, but we've never had -- we've never really gotten down to the exact conversation. 

00:51:15
MARY LEE Yeah. 

00:51:15
JOHN We've talked about it on the outside edges, but we've either not known where we could go from there or we've been afraid to. 

00:51:30
SUE JOHNSON So we've either not known how to do it or we've been afraid to. And John doesn't mind me telling you that that's very ironic because actually he's a communications expert, who goes around the world telling governments how to communicate with each other. And he says, "I can communicate with everyone, except Mary Lee". We are beginning to know, if we think about couples therapy in the 21st century I think it's going to be very exciting. We are beginning to know what is necessary and sufficient to create lasting change in key relationships. What specific responses and moves do I need to guide couples into to transform their relationships. Attachment is a dance of survival and connection that has moved us since the beginning of time. It's wired into our brains. To have a 21st century couple intervention, we need to plug into the power of this enate survival system and believe me couples do. They have -- it's -- they find it, EFT, particularly relevant for them. Couples from all walks of life and cultures tell us that the attachment view of love has a white hot relevance that it fits with something inside them to quote Freud talking about great literature, there's something inside you that leaps out to embrace its truth. To create lasting loving relationships in our own and in our clients lives, we have to recognize, accept, shape and give precedence to the primal code of attachment rather than bypassing or trying to dismiss it. And we can do this now. We have a map. We in this field seem to have focused on, as Minuchin puts it, the limitations of belonging, the danger of meeting others becoming fused with them. Perhaps it's now time to understand that limitless potential of belonging, that true belonging, secure bonding is our deepest need, our birthright and our strength. The new science of bonding is challenging our field on every level. It's challenging the basic way we think about the goals of couple therapy. Acevedo and Aron's recent study on how new and longtime lovers' brains reacted to pictures of their loved one showed that to quote them, "Romantic love can indeed last over time." These researchers issued a challenge for therapists that we have higher expectations for ourselves as clinicians that we take on this task, which has not been shown to be impossible of showing couples how to make love rich and how to make it last. In this new century, we are gonna do just that and more. Thank you. 

00:54:45
[sil.] 

00:54:55
SUE JOHNSON And I think we have -- I don't know if I am -- if people are allowed to ask questions. Jeff, are you -- is it okay? We have about three or four minutes, so I actually amazingly did it efficiently and you are very welcome to ask questions. Would people like to ask some questions? Yes. Do you want to use the microphone? 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Hello, I don't know if you can hear me. 

00:55:20
SUE JOHNSON Yes, I can hear you. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN I was very saddened recently by the death of Elizabeth Edwards from incurable breast cancer. 

00:55:30
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. Elizabeth Edwards dying from incurable breast cancer, yes. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Yes. And I read in the newspaper, all the challenges she had in the last few years of her life, for instance, the death of her teenage son, the diagnosis of breast cancer after the presidential election race was over. 

00:55:50
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN And also the infidelity of her husband and the illicit child that resulted from that relationship and I was just sitting here wondering if there's any research that relates to the recovery from breast cancer and how can relationship counseling assist that. So what would you do -- how would you approach a situation like that with a person needs to heal and was obviously in need of that touch that you were talking about. 

00:56:25
SUE JOHNSON That's an incredibly rich question. We have a study that we did, um, I'm not quite sure if it's out yet, we did a study with breast cancer survivors. Mind you, those folks were -- had been in remission for couple of years, right? But they had active PTSD, many of them. And we did a study using EFT with them, right? And looking at how, for example, um, in -- you're always dealing with the fear of recurrence and how do you deal with that positively. Can you turn to your partner for support and comfort and if you cannot what does that mean? You're always dealing with perhaps physical disfigurement from the treatment et cetera, right? But the point about that one is that what we know is it seems like the literature is telling us that turn -- being able to turn to a loving partner, a secure loving partner and share and receive comfort, right? Helps us through almost any mental and physical difficulty that you can imagine including an illness like cancer. And when we cannot do that we usually end up coping in dysfunctional ways. 

00:57:35
SUE JOHNSON The thing about that lady is, I also am hit though that she received a huge injury to her relationship when she needed at the most. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:57:40
SUE JOHNSON When she found out about her partners affair and we know from our forgiveness research that we can help people work with that, but it takes time. I do have no idea if that couple received any help. I would hope they would. I feel like a 21st century couples therapist, you know, would have been able to help them with that. Hopefully what comes out for me is the hope that when she was dying that her partner was able to be there for her. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:58:10
SUE JOHNSON And that he was able to -- to help her walk into that good night as it's called, right? Hopefully -- I hope that was true. If you're asking me, if we know how to work with that kind of crisis situation in the therapy I use, yes we do. But it's not easy especially in that because there's a lot of elements there. There's a lot of grief, a lot of betrayal, right? 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:58:35
SUE JOHNSON You're not just dealing with cancer. But yes, I feel like that's gonna be part of the role of the couples therapists in the 21st century is to be called into times like that. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN She did write a book called Resilience. 

00:58:45
SUE JOHNSON Did she? 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:58:50
SUE JOHNSON That's great. I'm gonna read it. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN And she spoke out about it to other women who are in her situation. 

00:58:55
SUE JOHNSON Right. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN And that was her way of healing herself, but I do believe that she could've used her ex-husband to assist her with healing. 

00:59:05
SUE JOHNSON Yes, yes. So hard to deal with that kind of threat from cancer and also to deal with all the grief and loss, right? 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN Thank you, very much. 

00:59:10
SUE JOHNSON Maybe we have time for one more, if someone has one. Looks like folks are leaving here, but everyone needs to get to their next and one of those talks is mine actually, so maybe we should -- maybe we should stop. Thank you for coming.
