00:00:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You're composer, you write music. You write music and words simultaneously. 

00:00:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:00:35
JEFFREY ZEIG In 20 minutes, you write a song. 

00:00:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. There's a lot of different terms for that. You can-- a very heavy-handed, they call it channeling, or, uhm, listening to the muse, letting source screen through you. I just call it writing. 

00:00:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And you're-- you're great at it. 

00:00:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Thanks. 

00:00:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Sixty million plus albums that you've sold and, ah, 33 million copies of Jagged Little Pill, yeah. Aha. You've been, ah, on television, you've been in movies, you're a child TV, ah, performer, star. 

00:01:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. That explains the trauma. 

00:01:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And, and now, you're a writer and you have a book coming out. So, so - 

00:01:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:01:15
JEFFREY ZEIG - tell us something about that. 

00:01:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, I have, ah, 700 pages for a book, and it was a multitudinous vision for me. It was wanting to tell stories which initially I had absolutely no interest in my own story, I was sufficiently disassociated enough that I didn't wanna hear, ah, one more word about my story, except for writing three-minute songs, that was enough for me. I would max it at three minutes. So, I've actually hired a coach to inspire me to care about my story enough to tell it. 

00:01:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:01:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, that's the first book is telling a lot of stories with humor and I like to think humanity. And then, another book down the road, more sort of teaching academia ESL. 

00:01:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:01:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE And then another book about spirit and-- oh, ideally, I would have loved to have blended them all together, but War and Peace is a long book. 

00:02:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, you-- your art is about social activism, you're writing is about social activism. 

00:02:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:02:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. And you use art as a vehicle to be a social activist. 

00:02:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. I think artists by default even those who are perhaps chronologically young to the point where they don't wanna take on the huge responsibility that they're catapulted into by default with theme. You're-- you're an activist by default. And in certainly, in my early 20's, I had no interest in being responsible to that degree. And then I grew into the role and I saw that the only reason why I wouldn't want to continue to endure for luck, in a better term, being in a public eye, being a sensitive, ah, being so affected by the intense energy that can be the case when you're in the public eye to that degree. I thought the, the only way that I could continue this journey would be to imbue it with the sense of intentionality, in the sense of service. Uhm, and social commentary, emotional, psychological commentary-- thank you. Uhm, commentary is just what's-- you know, sort of the 60's and 70's approach of commenting on what was happening in the world, socially, politically, you know. Commentary in Vietnam, all of it, and I just really-- I feel like I'm that archetype, I'm that kind of animal and I'm also profoundly shallow so I was-- I was perfect for the pop culture music industry. 

00:03:25
Cope with: • Eating disorder • PTSD after Jagged Little Pill • Post-partum depression. • Love addiction And you have been a therapy and psychological growth advocate. 

00:03:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, you, you have coped with a lot. You've coped with eating disorders, you've coped with some degree after Jagged Little Pill. This was a shock. This was almost like a post-traumatic stress disorder. 

00:03:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. I would take the word almost out for sure. 

00:03:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And post-partum depression, you've coped with that. 

00:03:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE A lot of posts. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Love addiction. 

00:03:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Right. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG But you've been in Africa for psychological growth, for psychological development - 

00:03:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY ZEIG - for spiritual development. 

00:03:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. And, and it's not been an easy birth. 

00:03:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE No. My aunts and a few-- my family members often shake their heads wondering what kind of agreement I made before I started this particular lifetime. And, uhm, it's only now that things are making sense, even in real time in this moment, my sitting here, speaking with all of you who are in physicians of profound service around the planet. Now, it all makes sense. Ah, it didn't so much make sense when I was in the middle of it as you can imagine. 

00:04:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I can imagine. 

00:04:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, lemons and the lemonade. 

00:04:25
How we met Relationship First 

00:04:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So, let's put a graphic up in. Let's see something about how we first met. 

00:04:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Okay. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Which is because of Harville. Harville Hendrix - 

00:04:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY ZEIG - is one of the faculty here. 

00:04:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. God bless. 

00:04:35
www.relationshipsfirst.org Relationships First Better Relationships. Better Lives. Better World. www.facebook.com/RelationshipFirst 

00:04:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And that Harville started this movement which, ah, is relation-- ah, and Helen - 

00:04:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:04:40
JEFFREY ZEIG - started this movement called Relationships First. 

00:04:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm. 

00:04:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And that this was inviting experts and couples. There would be John Gottman, Sue Johnson, Jette Simon, and bringing together not only people who are interested in couples, but people who are interested in social dynamics and social change - 

00:04:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm. 

00:04:55
JEFFREY ZEIG - bringing together you in the entertainment industry, bringing together businessman and forming this movement which is being, ah, shown here. This is a soft launch for Relationships First. 

00:05:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:05:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And so because of that, ah, we met. And, ah, Imago was important to you, it was important to you in some of your recovery. 

00:05:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Definitely, ah, actually, Harville and Imago, and Helen just really made relationships make sense to me. Uhm, you know, the proverbial, ah, infatuation as well of segueing into the nightmare. And I would say, typically in, in modern day culture, if we can call it, that soon as conflict starts to happen that's when I was don't, uhm, or when the relationship would fall apart. So, I, I have to believe on some level that there was a third goal to persevere through the, the post-honeymoon stress disorder. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Terrific. 

00:05:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, and there really is this idea of active participation in each other's healing. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:05:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE You know, and so, so growth is certainly what is required to be the brave warrior or in order to change certain behaviors that may have kept as alive when we were younger and, and help us in our survival approach, but is not working so well in terms of connection and intimacy. So, persevering through conflict and helping it, you know-- uhm, touch on wounds that we had in our childhood, and, and helping participate actively in each other's healing. And now that I married with someone who is very intentional about it with me, and, and very much human at the same. We're not perfect at it. I wouldn't call us master couples as I think John and Julie Gottman call them. We're getting there. But, uhm, but anyway, the point is, is that I'm now tasting healing cuz growth is always been a part of my album and part of my soldier ask approach to life. 

00:06:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:06:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE But the actual experience of bona fide healing, I've frankly only had 15 starts along the way, a little glimpses of it. But it was such a sweet nectar that I persevered and it's now full-blown in my marriage, and I think it's horrible. And your Imago model, uhm, Harville, would you say that the degree of intimacy and the degree of commitment is commensurate of the degree of healing available. And certainly, that's found in couple of hard and, and romantic committed partnerships. I'm also finding it in, in different committed relationships, and it is the commitment and intimacy, uhm, that precedes this incredible of healing capacity that is available to us through deepening commitment in a relationships. So, I'm excited. 

00:07:30
We are making you an honorary psychotherapist! Do you want to be considered: a. An Antipodean Therapist? b. A therapist in Retrograde? c. A Contrapositive Therapist d. A Paradoxical Therapist e. All of the above? As a "Paradoxical" Therapist • Traditionally Therapist cloak themselves in collectively acceptable generalities. • You inspire people by doing a very classy emotional striptease. You are so confidently transparent. It allow people to relate to you...and to themselves. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Let's see at the graphic for a minute. 

00:07:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:07:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, so we're making you, ah, an honorary psychotherapist. 

00:07:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE That's awesome. 

00:07:40
JEFFREY ZEIG All right. So, here - 

00:07:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Ready. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY ZEIG - here are your choices. 

00:07:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh-oh. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Ready? 

00:07:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Okay. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY ZEIG That do you wanna be considered an antipodean therapist - 

00:07:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE That sounds like a scary word. 

00:07:50
JEFFREY ZEIG - a therapist in retrograde - 

00:07:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yup. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY ZEIG - a co-- ah, contrapositive therapist, a paradoxical therapist, or d-- or e, all of the above? 

00:08:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE They sound scary. But I think d. 

00:08:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh. 

00:08:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE As paradoxes just, ah... 

00:08:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And, and here is the paradox. 

00:08:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:08:10
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, traditionally, we, as therapists, we cloak ourselves in collectively acceptable generalities. 

00:08:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Right. Did you just directly... 

00:08:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And we stay invisible. 

00:08:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Ah. 

00:08:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And what you do is that you do this incredibly classy, ah, of being little grasp though, emotional striptease. 

00:08:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Right. 

00:08:25
JEFFREY ZEIG You are so transparent - 

00:08:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:08:30
JEFFREY ZEIG - in your presentation and who you are in the world, in your interviews, in your songs. 

00:08:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:08:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And what that does is it gives us an opportunity to know something about you, but in something about ourselves. 

00:08:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:08:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Because you're so transparent. 

00:08:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh, I see it. 

00:08:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:08:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah, transparency is really relaxing for me because I don't have to worry about whom I like to and, and how to make good on certain things that I, I presented in my presentational self-- presentation. So, uhm, of course, I'm politically considerate and I, you know, not, ah, not irresponsibility and over sharing in that sense, but with art, there is a very, very much a green light to be transparent. And I know right now it's fantastically trendy to be vulnerable and there's a lot of great, you know, tag lines on it thereabout vulnerability and transparency. And I really enjoy talking about what it actually looks like and, and how it benefits, for me, personally, it benefits a lot, but I do wanna go on record with you saying that, "The artistically to process is cathartic, but it's not healing." So, I would sing you wanna know and a lot of songs for years and years on stage, and there was a lot of movement of energy and, uhm, that was helpful on a somatic physical level. But the actual singing monologically, the content on my songs did not yield healing in a way that I thought I could get away with finding in a studio in a way that I thought I wouldn't have to deal with human beings, I can just be in the studio and singing these songs, experience the healing and then hide. But it doesn't work. 

00:10:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:10:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, it's a beautiful movement of energy, it's a conversation starter that certainly has lifted me out of depression cuz there's that beautiful anger that can catapult me into the next place. Uhm, and it can certainly prepare me for intimacy, but the robber really hits the road in the day-to-day interactions. So, what I have been attempting to do over the last 27 years is to take the courage from the song writing process and from the content, and the revelations, and apply those to my, you know, my marriage and my friendships, and, and that's really the goal and I'm on that journey. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And you've done tremendous about doing that. 

00:10:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:10:45
Evolved from upstream to mainstream; from protest to inclusion. Please comment. We even have a graphic... 

00:10:45
JEFFREY ZEIG You, you started with protest and you started upstream - 

00:10:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh. 

00:10:50
JEFFREY ZEIG - and then, you become mainstream. 

00:10:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:10:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And the process of moving from anger and protest to-- they get-- to be, ah, affiliative and to be a relational. Can you say... 

00:11:05
Erstwhile Alter Ego 

00:11:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh, I used to be shamed for my as-- aspiration, for functionality. You know, I was really unhip to be functional. So, I was unhip for a very long time, and then the consciousness is we're all experiencing right now, I imagine, has raised to the point where it's actually becoming hip to be functional and communicative, and transparent and direct. And you know, so, thank God for that. 

00:11:30
Can you riff about? • Service Through Art. • It is all about relationships. • Creativity comes from Joy and Anger 

00:11:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So, service through art - 

00:11:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:11:35
JEFFREY ZEIG - and being of service and using your art is a way of being service especially in the spirit of relationships. 

00:11:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Ah. 

00:11:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:11:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. I mean, for me, it's multitudinous, it's relationship with spirit or God, it's relationship with other marriage family, my son, girl friendships is a big deal for me. I've experienced a lot of-- on a very animal level of envy in the competition, in the context of patriarchy were set up on some level and having on broad stroking it. But we're set up on some level to compete and basically, kill each other. Uhm, so just-- that, that's actually a primary focus on my part in terms of, of deepening commitment in connection with my female friends, uhm, and then relationship within one zone self and all these archetypes and said personalities, and, you know, dream work and all of it. I just feel there's trillions of relationships at any given moment and I'm obsessed with connection, and I'm obsessed with the idea of unity and mending in healing to the point where I've just been made fun of a lot certainly. And I've been, uhm, walked away from on many occasions because of how obsessed I am of it. But then, I need you people. Yeah. And being part of Relationships First has been, ah, a great healing for me because I, I am in a room and, and now, in a larger room of people who would have the same true north and the same star of Bethlehem that we're chasing. And I have to mark how grateful I am to you and to the entire psychotherapeutic community around the planet for how crazy we are to get into this whole worlds, to begin with but the deep profound service and generosity to support people in returning to their original home most. It is God's work that everybody's up to and I have to thank you. 

00:13:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, yes. 

00:13:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:13:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, you chose to do this, you wanted to speak to therapist. Why? 

00:13:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Gratitude or attitude. And also just to see, you know, in real time what's going on, what do we grappling with, you know, I know a lot of-- I've had the privilege of, of speaking in front of a lot of it from people, my favorite is, is dialogue. 

00:14:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. Yes. 

00:14:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE And it's-- it's, you know, inherently feminine. So really to, to talk about what's happening in 2014, changing the idea of the feminism, which is been so powerful and so important, such an incredible multiple link in, in the long chain of our own evolution. But to point toward the feminine leading to understanding how to bridge both sides of the brain, or integrate both sides of the brain, how to feel feelings in a culture that basically doesn't even allow you to feel joy. You know, you don't-- the big message-- pervasive message is be as ignorable and as neutral, and as invisible as possible because we don't wanna have to feel anything by watching you feel it, or the opposite that a lot of people in the audience actually are excited to feel and music is incredible for that on a somatic direct to the heart in the jugular experience. But your question, I wanna go back to that. It was important. 

00:14:55
General Questions • Why did you want to speak to therapists? • Studying excellence: What do you do in your profession that makes you excellent? • You have known many excellent people. What makes them excellent? • What is your intention? How do you want to impact? • Your vision of the feminine in contemporary culture? • What has psychology and psychotherapy brought to you? • What have you learned (the hard way) about relationships that you want us to know? • What advice do you have for clinicians? 

00:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. I just... 

00:14:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE You ask the question, kind of read of it. Did I hear you-- ah, what did you ask-- you ask? Oh, yeah? 

00:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG You came from an era-- from a-- from a, a background where being perfect, was really part of your script. 

00:15:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:15:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And you had to break out of that script and - 

00:15:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah, 

00:15:10
JEFFREY ZEIG - figure out who Alanis was going to be. 

00:15:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. I just feel like our traumatic responses are all in a continuum, we overachieved or underachieved, or over responsible, under responsible, I erred on the side of over. 

00:15:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:15:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE And then in my 20's and 30's, I dabbled in the other side of the continuum which was fantastic. Uhm, ultimately, hopefully, finding some way to that middle ground, which is moderate and boring, and fantastic and healing, and amazing. 

00:15:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:15:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE And still, really inspiring. A lot of people ask me, you know, "Is there anything to write about as you become more functional?" And my answer is, uhm,-- I, I think passion writes, passion creates, so passionate love, passionate rage. And the rage that I experienced from a traumatic place when I was 19 is being channeled into activism and showing up here. It's anger that would have me show up here. Just anger about watching the, the profound incessant, unnecessary suffering that we all endure for, for believing this full thoughts of matter souls. And it's a necessity developmental stages, you know, and I just read Sue Johnson's new book, and Dan Siegel is writing a new book or releasing a new book called Brainstorm. And any, any, any teacher and there's-- maybe every single adolescence room. Anytime that I hear anyone speaking about the stages of development, I just get so excited and my-- one of my many agendas would be to render the stages of development, just super common place subject matter in pop culture, everywhere we go that we would understand that wherever this trauma's happened shows up on our adult life. On some level, it's not green surgery, but yet on-- in pop culture and in, in the mainstream in general, there is a, a very huge void of understanding about the psychological makeup of not only how does first initial year can play out but also the effect that it has on us as adults, and the micro of how we are in our homes and how it shows up in politics, in our wars, in all of it. So, the micro and the macros are inextricably linked that, for me, as an artist, I love the immediacy of writing about personal relationships and in a very conversational way because I think that they indicate what's going on on a larger scale and other contexts. So, so that's fun. 

00:17:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Very good. 

00:17:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY ZEIG So, let me push to you a little bit, okay. We-- one of the reasons for inviting you is you're an elite performer. You do things that other people haven't been capable of doing with your music, with your writing, with your composition. 

00:17:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:17:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm, and so, uhm, excellence. Then, what is-- what is it that you do that helps you strive for your own personal excellence? 

00:18:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, ah, I'm a highly sensitive temperament. And so, I think what comes along with that according to Eleanor, in 20% of animals and humans, and maybe even plants-- don't go me on that one-- uhm, are highly sensitive. So, instead of taking in, you know, for, for, ah, a, a quick short broad stroke metaphor, instead of taking in information through the 50 channels that we take them in, which is a lot, you know, idea being that this temperament that I have-- I've taken 500 pieces of information. And so that makes, uhm, archetypically, that's-- that predisposes us to being perfect, for being the priests and priestesses, and psychotherapists and, ah, artists, uhm, sages and leaders, you know. There's-- there's a certain kind of animal that I believe I'm a-- I'm part of the larger group of us that do it and we find ourselves in locations and careers that require awareness of subtlety. So, what was your question? 

00:19:05
JEFFREY ZEIG It's about excellence. 

00:19:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Sorry. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY ZEIG It's about being excellent. Yeah. 

00:19:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Excellent. So, uhm, it's just-- it's a sensual conversation for me, smells and visual, static, design. I'm obsessed at-- in a-- in a not overly, uhm, control freaky way, I like to think anyway my colleagues might see differently, but I appreciate, ah, beauty and that's decidedly feminine. 

00:19:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:19:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE You know, it was exciting that this time for me is that-- has been large amounts of debate and conversation about where the feminist movement has arrived that now. And what I find exciting is that the feminist conversation and the evolution of feminism outside, you know, moving away from patriarchy is that, the feminine ideally, for me, would be what is upheld by the mass healing and feminine in both gender. So, pulling it directly out of the gender worst conversation, and throwing it right into-- that which connects and heals, and bonds, uhm,-- and I know when I say masculine and feminine, it can be very outputting to some people that I have spoken with. So, I often used the words yin and yang cuz it just takes a lot of the whole gender conversation in general. But ideally, if we are to go a place where there will be a general sense of harmony and functionality, the feminine can be upheld and supported by this divine masculine, divine yang that conserve-- and that the currency of the generosity and pro-- the propensity to provide which is inherently a male animal thing or a masculine thing. The currency has changed now. So there was a day where you had to bring home the veg and vegan, you know, and you have to-- there were certain currencies that, ah,-- they were the only ones that men were to provide all the way to bringing home the dear. 

00:20:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:20:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, now, ah, what's happening is that the currency of what men and the masculine is providing, just shows up differently, case by case, context by context. And that the feminine were being called to be receptive and be the empowered feminine, but to be the feminine and that it's a continuum when the world inclined toward one side or the other, or some of us were in the middle, some of us enjoy using both sides of the brain, and that there's no va-- value judgment about where you lie. But that the movement, the feminist movement in my opinion where we've arrived that now is that the yin is supported by this powerful masculine and feminine in both genders. And so, when I'm in meeting, or I'm performing at a show, I'm watching a television show, that's what I notice now, that's what I pick up on rather than looking at it as a gender war, a patriarchal context where women are treated in a disrespectful way or the homosexual community is being shamed and just profoundly misunderstood. I just think of it in terms of masculine and feminine, or yin and yang. And it's made things much clear for me and, uhm, he raises-- I mean, certainly where bodies-- our bodies are physiologically and biologically male or female although there's lovely great area with that, with transgender and all of that fun stuff too. But, uhm,-- so for me, it's about upholding this feminine agenda that will lead us to some version of salvation - 

00:22:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:22:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE - in my thought. 

00:22:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You, you largely think in relationship's the hard way. 

00:22:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:22:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. So, what are some of the things that, that you want to pass on with that, uhm, some of the struggles that you've had and how you've overcome them and... 

00:22:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Hmm, ah, well, in terms of really... 

00:22:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And there was-- turned this into a therapization. 

00:22:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE In terms of relationship? 

00:22:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:22:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE You mean, romantic specifically, or-- well, well, I would say, ah, inquiry, inquiry to something that I think I've gleaned from it, inquiry of what's going on and, ah, it just means that I have to actually feel. 

00:23:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:23:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE And I just love all the food and the, the things the help-- you know, all the addictions are just so wonderful, they do their jobs so well. Uhm, so, for me, it's about, you know, feeling and that intensity of intimacy, you know, for me, a lot of-- uhm, some of the best therapists in my life have just really supported me in tolerating the, the intensity that is required for me to feel in my body while I'm experiencing intimacy. And, ah, my one therapist shared with me, she said, the solid shy, so be gentle. You know, so, I love that, and, uhm,-- so that was one of six million other revelations. Can you ask me a question, cuz sometimes I don't know what to say to the broad kind of question like that. 

00:24:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:24:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE What do you think. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. I'll try to focus. 

00:24:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh, about relationship cuz I think there's some goodies in here. 

00:24:15
JEFFREY ZEIG So, what? 

00:24:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, your question was about - 

00:24:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:24:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE - some other revelations or some other wisdoms gleaned from the more troublesome. 

00:24:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:24:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, hmm, active participation in the recovery journey, it's been huge, love addiction recovery, treat a malady in the meadows, uhm, their home movement is just profoundly supportive and helpful. Uhm, and I just became the consummate student, you know. And from moment to moment, sometimes 10 seconds of separation between both, I just love being student and teacher, and friend. I just vacillate between those three at any given time. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And you do a lot of journal and you do - 

00:24:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY ZEIG - a lot of self, uhm, self-analysis and self-discovery. 

00:25:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:25:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And so, delving into yourself that's been part of how your art has been created in spite of what, what drives you, and - 

00:25:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:25:10
JEFFREY ZEIG - then, those moments that you can collect inside yourself. 

00:25:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:25:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And then you make the public in your songs and you give them an opportunity for us to relate even deeper into ourselves. That's a, a tremendous contribution. 

00:25:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh, that's great. 

00:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG You know. 

00:25:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE I'm glad. 

00:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:25:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. I have, uhm,-- art is, is such an incredible, uhm, form, you know, whether it's music or photographs, I can't draw to see my life. Uhm, but so many forms of expression, lot of times, I'll watch a video, or listen to a song that I wrote, or listen to it 10 years later and it says, "Though, that song is speaking directly to me at the time." So, there's a timelessness and a magic to art. And in the same breath, I can say that artistic expression are like many snapshots of different periods of time in, in this case in my life. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, last time you said that music takes language into a place that language been only aspire. 

00:26:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Ah. 

00:26:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And that music is not something that is optional, it's not something that's elective in life, it's something that's essential - 

00:26:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY ZEIG - to life. 

00:26:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:26:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE And for those who created, I would think it's an imperative. 

00:26:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:26:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:26:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And as your discipline, do you-- you know, you, you play the flute, you play the guitar. 

00:26:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE I love that you know that. 

00:26:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:26:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, I love that pocket secret. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY ZEIG I looked at a lot of information. Yeah. 

00:26:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, yeah, if there's-- ah, ah, you know, I believe that's-- we have different, ah, piece with which the current of live steam are rest. And so, in my particular-- this particular filter, or animals case, the energy is moving through really quickly. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:26:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE And so, for a long time, I made that other people's problem. And, ah, I just feel much more responsible for it so I have to write, and I need to move and I need to dance, and I need to have the somatic and the intellectual, and the emotional and all of them blended together, for me, to be tolerable to my husband. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:27:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Pretty much. 

00:27:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Ah, you know, ah, I, I ask in Eric-- so let me give you a question. 

00:27:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE I love that. Oh, yeah. 

00:27:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And so, so, ah, ah, you know, to be so charming, to be talented, to be so beautiful - 

00:27:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Well... 

00:27:35
JEFFREY ZEIG - and, ah, you know, so transparent, is this something that you worked out, or is this something that you just got too easily? 

00:27:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE I went to charm school. No, uhm, I failed. No, uhm,-- excuse me to say that, all I can say to you is thank you. And, uhm, it's a-- it's an interesting set up to have, ah, a highly sensitive temperament, this imperative to create, ah, have this ham-like quality that would-- that would have me be audacious enough to get on stage and perform, and travel the planet and perform. Combined with profound introversion, ah, and anxiety, uhm, so it's the perfect storm for whatever is going on here. 

00:28:20
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, now, you're so intentional in my worth. I'm so disciplined, I'm so strategic, I'm so thoughtful. 

00:28:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE You are. 

00:28:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And then what you do is-- well, ah... 

00:28:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Well, there's structuring what I do. 

00:28:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:28:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. It is really using both sides of the brain and there is a discipline. 

00:28:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:28:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE You know, I will-- I will split my days. And right now, I'm writing a book. So, I'd work out every morning, five days a week, spend a lot of time with my family and then, I dive into writing mode from noon till five or six everyday, eve-- five days a week, and then weekends are off. Structure has been, you know-- you asked a few minutes ago in a way that I didn't respond to a length about what I've gleaned from some of the more challenging relationships. And that's certainly is one of them, how structure benefits, and discipline benefit is almost like, you know-- I use my intellect to siphon through this mysterious beautiful, ah, life force that creates art. And I'm humbled by it and I realized that I have been given many gifts and my-- the use of these gifts for me is my thank you. You know, and when I don't use it, I just feel like Mr. Incredible in The Incredibles, did you see that movie? Oh, he's just really not so happy at the beginning cuz he's not being used, his gifts are not being used. And, uhm, so, if I can support people and finding out what their unique-- often, it's 20 talents at the same time and people say, "Oh, I don't have-- I don't have talents," and I just giggle, cuz, ah,-- so for me, it's about supporting that and inspiring that and being the public eye is really being up for being a best screen upon which people project, light, dark, hostility, care, all of it. So, holding that energy can be intense and I just have to make sure I hideaway and take care of myself, you know. 

00:30:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Is-- ah, in-- but, I'll be earthy for a moment, both side said that he created music the way that cow has pissed. 

00:30:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Exactly. 

00:30:25
JEFFREY ZEIG He, he just-- it's just potato of it. Very structured, very thoughtful, very strategic, wanting to know every note, every instrument - 

00:30:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:30:35
JEFFREY ZEIG - and really being, uhm, absolutely precise. 

00:30:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Right. 

00:30:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And, and your style? 

00:30:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, designing process, ah, is usually looks like often around 20 to 45 minutes, lyrics and music written at the same time. 

00:30:50
JEFFREY ZEIG How was that happen? How was that possible? 

00:30:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Ah, ah, ah,-- uhm, I, ah, I think of it as when I sit down and write a really fast email - 

00:31:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:31:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE - it's a same thing. 

00:31:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha. 

00:31:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, I sit down and it's a conversation, or it's a request, or it's a delegation, or it's a little note. And in, in somewhere the content of that email had to come from somewhere. And this music in the words in the storytelling comes from that exact same place. 

00:31:25
JEFFREY ZEIG But the, the discipline, spontaneity, it's the combination of spontaneity and discipline is there's got to be an initial discipline - 

00:31:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yes. 

00:31:30
JEFFREY ZEIG - that allows you to generate that kind of incredible spontaneity. 

00:31:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE The discipline for me is structuring. When I write a record, I-- I'm, I'm in the studio from one till 4:30 pm, five days a week. And it's usually in a studio and oftentimes, it's collaborative cuz that's the most fun for me. And I certainly can do it alone but I live for interdependence and I couldn't be happy without the movement of this planet, moving toward interdependence. We have that, that funny and lonely, and, and disconnected autonomy movement for a long time, which had, you know, it's moment in the sun, and, ah, on some level, was probably a writing passage, or if not a painful one. And, ah, we went from the dependence to the independence, and thankfully, now, there's this interdependence. So, when it comes to writing songs, I love to write it alone, certainly, I can do that, but I'm far prefer the collaborative process with one-on-one echoing five. So much fun. 

00:32:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:32:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, let's see, maybe we open up to some questions, and - 

00:32:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY ZEIG - see if so-- oh, people can generate and help us to stimulate the conversation. Aha. Who will be asked? 

00:32:40
 I love your boots. 

00:32:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Thanks. She said she loves my boots. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Your boots. Yeah. Uhm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Please. Yeah. Down there. 

00:32:55
 Check, check. Hi, I'm over here in the corner. 

00:33:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:33:00
 Hi. 

00:33:00
JEFFREY ZEIG My goodness. 

00:33:00
 First of all, thank you for being here, Alanis. It's really nice to hear from you and I don't know, just get to know you at very tiny bit. So, thank you. Uhm, and I guess my question is about your discussion in relation to the feminine and masculine, and kind of those dynamics that we're all experiencing, and specifically about like the movement and the feminist movement. 

00:33:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm. 

00:33:25
 And I've studied a little bit about like first wave, second wave, third, third wave, all of that, and I'm wondering what you think about, uhm, just intersectionality and what's going on in our nation in terms of the present industrial complex in those issues. 

00:33:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Thanks for being free for questions. 

00:33:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE First of all, I, I feel like I may not be educated in the same, uhm, vernacular than you are, as you are. 

00:33:50
 Sure. 

00:33:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, sorry if I don't respond. 

00:33:50
 That's okay. Yeah. 

00:33:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Okay. 

00:33:55
 Uhm-hmm. 

00:33:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, uhm, yeah. I, I would go back to what I said a few minutes ago which for me in a-- in a very semi-- simplified way, the feminist movement was, was wi-- wind up happening when men went to war and women stepped in, in order to prove that we were competent and that we could do it as well as men could, etcetera, etcetera, and it was such a beautiful stage. And it really did show us that we had access to this masculinity and we had access to this competence. It was very healing in some ways in that regard, but I don't actually think it afforded love in connection, in that complimentary juiciness. Uhm, and so, what's-- what's happened over the last many years in my mind is that, uhm, men and the masculine is being invited to integrate some of the more feminine qualities and the patriarchy, and the culture in general, certainly the music industry, profoundly patriarchal. There was a furtive time when I released the song called "You Oughta Know" and before it was formally released, we-- we've, you know-- there was a lot of new things out to radio stations. And the response at that time, which was 1995, was we have Tori Amos, we have Sinéad O'Conno, we don't need any more women, we're good. And, and thankfully, that has changed in a really huge way, you can't swing, ah, vegan cat without hitting a female artist now. So, uhm, joking about veganism, anyway. 

00:35:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Down there. Yes. 

00:35:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE I mean, I'm not. But, but I got, yeah. Uhm, so, just, just to kind of tie the bow and knot, uhm, what are you most curious about arou-- are you most curious about what's happening now, like where we are now? 

00:35:45
 I'm thinking about-- yeah. And I think a lot of feminists have come to recognize that particularly for well-intentioned white women, we've left out, women of color and intersectionality is kind of the idea that you can't leave behind one facet of your individual diverse character when you're coming to any conversation. 

00:36:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:36:05
 And so it's really easy for those of us-- those of us who are white, and in places of privilege should be like, "Yeah, women's rights." But, you know, or maybe one thing is that, "Oh, that were a woman." And so we're recognizing now as a movement partic-- particularly, white people in that movement, that we need to do better and that ignorance is no longer okay around that. And then we were talking about women's issues, we're also talking about clear women's issues and women of colors issues, and poor clear women of colors or transwomen issues. 

00:36:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:36:40
 Uhm, and that that's the direction that we're going. 

00:36:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE So, what you're describing is, is humanism. 

00:36:50
 Yeah. 

00:36:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE And, and the idea of the feminine and the masculine, and androgyny. I'm a big fan of the whole androgyny thing, it saved my life on so many-- on so many levels. So, not to say that that is one standard by which we can measure ourselves to beat ourselves up - 

00:37:05
 Right. 

00:37:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE - in accordance to. But, but that is ideally where we're going if, you know, wholeness is the-- is the holy grail. You know, so whether, you know, different aspects of ourselves and our color and our-- you know, dealing with those head-on from a very masculine and feminine, and both sides of the brained way. 

00:37:20
 Yeah. Thanks. 

00:37:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Thank you. 

00:37:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Other-- other-- and there is lots of people who are lined up since I would like to give as much opportunity. Please be brief. 

00:37:30
 Yeah. I'm a 72-year-old social and binary wild dancer. Ah, Richard Leider talks about people over 70 have regrets about not taking more risk or living more intensely. And I wanna know if you're over 70, is it the way you're living? 

00:37:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE In some ways, yes. 

00:37:50
 Yeah. Welcome, and it's - 

00:37:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Thanks. 

00:37:55
 - so satisfying to be here, and here you speak this way. 

00:37:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Right. 

00:37:55
 Uhm, my friend Al Lewin here, whatever here, ah, four of the evolutions talked about singing as the expression of longing, and I wonder anyway, in dreams. Have you see that longing and longing that you would-- or have hopes for how we might be active in other ways in the world that would come from your life experience as an artist. 

00:38:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah, it's the existential ache, you know, for connectivity. And what if, for me, would, ah,-- you know, I would love to be a steamroller in my own personal life and to whatever degree I can be in art. To steamroll over any fall start that would have be believe in this case that were disconnected. So, unity obsessed, wholeness obsessed, you know, which brings in the emotions, and the body and the vulnerability, and the power, and all these different aspects of being human. And the, the rapture that is singing to me is been such a great gift, just like a prayer. So, when I'm on stage, it's this delightful conversions of being sweaty and lost in this rapture but very intentional and very powerful, very physical. You know, so it's a convergence of, of what I enjoying most about being human. You know, and it-- and it isn't energetic dialogue with the audience too. 

00:39:10
 Thank you. 

00:39:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's take a question from over there at your right. 

00:39:15
 Hello. 

00:39:15
ALANIS MORISSETTE Hi. 

00:39:15
 Yes. Ah, I'm very intrigued by your comment about your performance is being cathartic but not necessarily healing. And I was wondering if, if you see where people use music to, to feel their anger, to feel their depression rather than being healed by it. And just what your thoughts are as far as what music artist can do to try to help people get to point of healing rather than just going further down this part of room. 

00:39:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE I think if, if art is created to, uhm, to, to dwell in the anger and then to go back into depression, uhm, probably entertaining, ah, not healing. Uhm, but for me, I used artist as a way to push me to whatever my next juncture or my next growth edge, or my next turning point is. Uhm, but I didn't realize pretty early on that catharsis is lovely and it's entertaining, and it's inspiring. And it can inspire growth and shift for my heart wasn't healed, and it was almost as though I was just feeling the same emotion over and over again, and oftentimes, I would channel, whatever I had on any given day in Israel or Japan, or wherever, I was performing, and I would use the song to move the energy. But I do see that as a step one, and a-- and a probably five-step process. You know, anger is, is such, ah, an incredible life force, it moves worlds, it creates activism, it, it dives into movements and creates movements, and, ah, gives courage to speak up and to set boundaries and to, uhm, connect. So, uhm, I don't know if that answer your question in anyway. But that's what just happened. 

00:41:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Over on the left. 

00:41:20
 All right. Uhm, I only actually have a question, but Alanis, I just wanna take the opportunity to say, hello. 

00:41:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Hi. 

00:41:25
 And thank you. Uhm, your music has been very inspiring, uhm, for me personally, and for those around me, and my, ah, kind of my peer group. And so I just mostly wanted to say thank you for, ah, channeling an energy that you talked about for being transparent and being open in your music, and for being able to take the things that I had been working onto my own life and then eventually studying and becoming a psychotherapist and putting on the popular stage. So, thank you. 

00:41:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Down there. 

00:41:55
 So, I'm gonna bring it back on that one. Uhm, I have to admit, I don't know your name when you first came on stage. So, I texted-- I texted my teenager who's 18, who is just started, it-- you see for, uhm, college and I-- and is obsessed with celebrities and in films department. And she goes, "Oh, my gosh, mom, that is awesome." 

00:42:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Look, Alanis, mom. 

00:42:25
 And I just wanted to say, as opposing, who's more for teenagers, with a lot of difficult times with two decades now is so wonderful to have somebody who they can look up to, and is actually inspiring for me, as a therapist and as a mom, to say, "Yes." So, thank you. 

00:42:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. You're welcome. 

00:42:45
 Hi. Uhm, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about what the feminine would look like in politics. Uhm, for instance, what would it look like if Congress was full of psychotherapists rather than lawyers. 

00:43:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE Great question. Uhm, I just performed-- Marianne Williamson is ready for Congress, I performed to her coming out party. Uhm, it was just really inspiring here in your speak because I was in a very minor way, I was invited into the political room, you know, as of probably 15 years ago, and, uhm, the construct that I would have to of dive into, ah, would have been debilitating for my particular constitutions. So, I couldn't dive into it and, uhm, I believe Marianne has a constitution that could persevere and I'm sort of like her, her wing woman. I'll support her through it. But, uhm, in terms of what it would look like, what would the feminine look like in politics? Uhm, there'd be more-- there'd be, uhm,-- hierarchy would remain to the degree that it would help define roles. But not to the degree that it would, uhm, that it would ascribe value to the different roles that is lesser than or worst than, or more-- better than or-- so, there would be more egalitarianism in general, there'd be more brainstorms, uhm, there'd be more leadership based on a different set of value systems. You know, for, for me, my own personal value system and, and, and I'm finally actually able to stand by this particular value system because being in the music industry has been slightly debilitating for me because the incentive is to make millions of dollars and to be famous. And I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that the western culture, which is now slowly becoming the whole planet, wants wealth. I think most people wanted to be millionaires before. Now, everybody wants to be a billionaire. So, billionaire, uhm, famous, just for the sake of being famous, ah, and, ah, being 20 looking and being 21 forever. So, so with that being the value system of, you know, in general. I'm broad stroking, very violently here and I apologize. But, uhm, with that being the value system, you know, politics here to be imbued with the huge dose of the feminine from men and women alike. Uhm, the value systems would be talked about out of the gate, what do we doing America, what do we value, you know, what about family, what about putting relationships first, what would the planet look like if we put relationships first in our colleagueships, in our friendships, in our family, in our work environment and in politics, in the financial room, what if our well-being and connectivity were prioritized not precluding the availability of generating money. Money is lovely, it's energy. Uhm, but the value system I think would be entirely different and the-- and the structure, the construct of the political room would change. There'd be an, an actual democracy and, and, uhm, blah, blah, blah, I could go on forever about that way. 

00:46:00
 Thanks. 

00:46:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you. Over on the left. 

00:46:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:46:05
 Hi. 

00:46:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Hello. 

00:46:05
 Uhm, a couple of observations and I guess, an interweaving for question for you. Uhm, I was really struck by, ah, certain themes that were coming up, in the way, we're talking about a lot of reference to somatic, the somatic experience in that, how that, as part of your healing, uhm, the creativity and then also the idea of, of the feminine rising. I'm, ah, dance/movement therapist, and, uhm, dance/movement therapy is a field pioner-- pioneered by women and been around for about 50 years, but yet, it's still very, very little known in the world of psychotherapy. 

00:46:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:46:40
 And, uhm, you made a comment that the artistic creative process is cathartic but not necessarily healing. And I would just ask you if you heard about-- I had any familiarity with creative art therapist, because that's what takes the, the creative process from the cathartic into the healing room because it's being worked on in that relationship. 

00:47:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Well, that's relationship, right? 

00:47:00
 Yeah. 

00:47:00
ALANIS MORISSETTE If I were to actually sing all my songs to the people who, who inspired this song, and they were sitting right across for me, I would probably experience healing. They may not. Yeah. So, I mean, you're-- you're touching on, on a point that is-- that kind of drives my entire life which is relationality, you know. 

00:47:25
 Yeah. 

00:47:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE And, and witness, witnessing. And certainly, the audience witnesses but it's not in an intimate context, and a lot of these beautiful people who come to my shows, I may never meet them, or I may never see them again. So, there's not a long term commitment there. So, I'm talking about my personal version of being on stage, but, uhm, the art therapy movements, ah, unbelievable, just bringing it all together in that convergent way that I experience on stage, and with the gentleness and the mercy and the empathy and the presence, and the atonement, not only from incredible things that we may or may not have missed out on during the stages of development where that was appropriate and beg for, you know, for it to be, ah, you know, these-- as human beings being invited into a corrective experience that is integrated in that way, God speed, God bless for what you're doing. 

00:48:20
 Thank you for allowing me this moment. Every lady. 

00:48:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. Thank you. 

00:48:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. From the center. 

00:48:25
JENNIFER Hi. I'm Jennifer, nice to meet you. 

00:48:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Nice to meet you. 

00:48:30
JENNIFER How long have you've been married? 

00:48:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, we got married in 2010. 

00:48:35
JENNIFER Awesome. 

00:48:35
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:48:35
JENNIFER What's your secret? 

00:48:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE To what? 

00:48:40
JENNIFER Being married. 

00:48:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh. 

00:48:40
JENNIFER Staying married. 

00:48:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, Imago therapist been pretty awesome for us. Uhm, we also do some, some slightly on conventional things, you know, we have couples therapy-- I hope this is okay. Where's LA? Is it okay if I talk about what, what, what we do, and my husband, right. Can I speak something out of school about our-- okay. You can just stop me if I'm saying something. Okay. Uhm, I mean to get your stamp. So, we'll do on commensal things. I have, ah, individual therapist that, uhm,-- my husband has an individual therapist. We'll get together all four of us, which is kind of unusual and maybe beyond ethics, and I'm gonna attack for this after. I have no idea. Uhm, it's not my jurisdiction. Uhm, uhm, and then among the therapist, it's just been so huge, just really illuminating how we're complimentarily wounded level, same level of willingness and intentionality, and, and intelligence and, you know, basically allowing each other's request of each other being a blue pint-- blue print for each other's growth and I fight it all the time, I just say, but it's good dependent and it's sexy, and I don't wanna be a mom and all these, you know, my resistances. But the truth to the matter is when I give you what you need the most which is not coincident-- coincidentally the hardest thing for me to give, I've just everything's way better. 

00:50:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:50:10
JENNIFER Thank you. 

00:50:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I can't remember which, ah, actress it was, who was talking about therapy, who said, I refused to be in unsupervised relationship. 

00:50:20
ALANIS MORISSETTE I think that's very stink. 

00:50:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Over there on the right. 

00:50:25
 Hello, Alanis. 

00:50:25
ALANIS MORISSETTE Hi. 

00:50:25
 Also very lucky. Uhm, my first introduction to your music and psychology was when I got to analyze, thank you, as a final for my undergraduate personality very class. 

00:50:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh. 

00:50:40
 And so, my question for you now... 

00:50:40
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh-oh. 

00:50:45
 I don't-- I don't remember what we set at that one, but my question for you now is if you were to look at yourself and talk about, you know, where you were maybe at that stage or even earlier when you wrote Jagged Little Pill, and you looked at theories of personality and how, how you evolve in who you are now. What would you say that progression was like? 

00:51:05
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm, for me, it was getting into active recovery around love addiction and active recovery around work addiction. And is it the, the-- what is it, the respectable addiction. You know, it was really becoming quite immeasurable and unmanageable. Uhm, you know, dissecting what codependence recovery is at this point is, you know, learning how to self-care and, ah, set boundaries, and every boundary I set is a self- defining process and I awakened from my slumber of having completely split off and fragmented in order to make this particular life work. Uhm, so a lot of inquiry, ah, a lot of bravery, I mean, anyone who's doing any work in this room and, and those who you serve on a daily basis. It's very, very brave work as we all know, I think. Uhm, so recovery eat-- I had eating disorder, bulimia and anorexia, as a younger person. So, really actively diving into that, ah, and then fame has its own PTSD, creating experience, we'll touch on that. 

00:52:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Sure. 

00:52:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE For a second. Uhm, I have the erroneous belief that soon as I became famous, that me and Johnny Depp would just totally be best friends, and, uhm, and that I'd have all this really fun famous friends, uhm, that was not the case, not-- you know, Johnny Depp's fine. Uhm, but, uhm, it wasn't the case and it, it actually around up disconnecting me more from people for how the repeat preconceive notions and expectations, and, uhm, misperception, pretty active and then, there are website that were erected to figure out how to kill me, ah, you know, it just really violent, hostile things that happened over the last 20 years. So, for me, it was about actually sharing those and, and doing some art therapy and some somatic work and really dive into Peter Levine and Pat Ogden's world and just was ready. 

00:53:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Let's take one more question from-- oh, we haven't questions in the back, I'm so sorry. 

00:53:10
 Hi. That's okay. 

00:53:10
ALANIS MORISSETTE Oh, hi. 

00:53:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Go for it. 

00:53:15
 Uhm, and you were talking earlier about, uhm, having a highly sensitive temperament and it reminded me of, uhm, a couple of people that I love a lot, and I was just curious if you could speak for a minute about how you learned to filter, all of the 500 things that you're taking in at once and, uhm, kind of get some of the strength that comes from that high-sensitivity. 

00:53:45
ALANIS MORISSETTE Well, out of gate, I would say, all of Elaine Aron's books. 

00:53:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uhm-hmm. 

00:53:50
ALANIS MORISSETTE Solving-- well, really in recognition. Uhm, and then, uhm... 

00:53:50
JEFFREY ZEIG She wrote The Highly Sensitive Person 

00:53:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. And The Highly Sensitive Child. She-- I believe right now, I'm not a 100% sure, but I think she's writing The Highly Sensitive Parent. Uhm, and then also taking many, many amounts of breaks. So, whether it's a bathroom stool or the corner of your office, or whatever, I mean, your office, my office, anywhere I could hide back of a tour bus. Ah, really being responsible, not unlike the way I would be for my son who has inherited the traits, and it's just so lovely there's a short-handed profound understanding of what it is to be that kind of creature. 

00:54:30
 Uhm-hmm. 

00:54:30
ALANIS MORISSETTE And, ah, really learning practical and structure ways to, uhm, to not be overwhelmed and staying in the area of, of resilient, you know, it's not over stimulated, not under stimulated, my life is wildly stimulating. So, I, I, I learned how to meditate and mindfulness practice and all of those, it really saved my life. Stress is a killer. 

00:54:55
 Uhm-hmm. 

00:54:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Uhm-hmm. 

00:54:55
JEFFREY ZEIG All right. Let's-- is it okay to close? We... 

00:54:55
ALANIS MORISSETTE Yeah. 

00:55:00
JEFFREY ZEIG We've, ah, come to, ah, the end of the hour.
