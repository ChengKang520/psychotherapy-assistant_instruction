Building Resilience in the Next Generation: Using the Power of Higher Self-Efficacy By Anndrea Wheatley

BUILDING RESILIENCE IN THE NEXT GENERATION - USING THE POWER OF HIGHER SELF-EFFICACY By Anndrea Wheatley 

00:00:00
Scales of resilience • Resilience balances between protective factors and risk factors. • The more protective factors a child or young person has the more resilience they will have e.g. close relationship to caregiver or parent, authoritative parenting, talents, intelligence, gifts, good school, caring environment..... • One such key protective factor is SELF-EFFICACY or self-confidence 

00:00:00
SELF-EFFICACY • What is it? The perception that one can achieve desired goals through one's actions. • "...one's capabilities to organize, and execute the course of action required to achieve goals, and this includes the mobilization of motivations and cognitive resources in order to have control over task demands." 

00:00:00
Self-efficacy and resilience • "....Among the mechanisms of human agency, none is more pervasively influential than self-efficacy beliefs, namely, beliefs individuals hold about their capacity to exert control over the events that affect their lives" 

00:00:00
Self-efficacy • "Efficacy beliefs help determine how much effort people will expend on an activity, how long they will persevere when confronting obstacles, and how resilient they will prove in the face of adverse situations." 

00:00:00
High self-efficacy vs Low self-efficacy • Those with higher self-efficacy (self-confidence) approach difficult task as challenges to be mastered rather than threats to be avoided. 1994 Schunk & Pajares, 2000 • Those with lower self-efficacy doubt their capabilities and shy away from difficult tasks which they view as personal threats, have low aspirations and weak commitments to their task-related goals. 

00:00:00
Self-efficacy predicts challenge or threat perceptions 

00:00:00
How Self-efficacy Works- it's a loop! • Mastery experience - 2010 Study , 33 countries, of 15 year olds ) • ..."mastery experience leads to feelings of self-efficacy which, in turn, contribute to subsequent mastery of future like tasks and so on...". • Mastery experience builds a person up and continues to loop back into self-efficacy each time they master the next thing. A child or young person continues to build up their self-efficacy as they take on more and more new tasks and experiences - it keeps looping back into their self-efficacy and builds their self-confidence.

Parenting or caregiving that develops children's resilience - caring environment - coupled with challenges to learn • Primary goals of parents include (Cazalino 2010, p.30) providing a child with the capacity for self-soothing and the ability to form positive relationships...this allows the child to face the challenges of life and benefit from healing life experiences..." • Growth and integration are optimized by a positive early environment including stage appropriate challenges, support, • ... and parents who are willing to put feelings into words..... Cazalino 2010, p.25 (narratives from parents to children- impact children to develop own narratives as they go through life).

Sources of Self-Efficacy 

00:00:00
Perceptions of a caring climate predicting psychological well-being • The significance of the indirect model provides evidence that the route through which the caring climate influences youngster's psychological well being is via the strengthening of their emotional efficacy. 

00:00:00
Its so simple: Growing in resilience together! 

00:00:00
Social Support - its so simple... • Psychologically adaptive approach There needs to be more psychologically adaptive approach our society/culture - one of 

00:00:00
Promoting healthy mental states in one another.... • "Furthermore, the 'regulation of emotion' may be dependent on large scale integrative processes - ones that emerge from prefrontal coordination and balance, as well as from interpersonal experiences within one-on-one relationships, families, communities, and even the larger culture in which we live. • ... Relationships that are attuned - ones that honour differences and cultivate compassionate connections - are integrative relationships that promote health. (Siegel 2012, p29)

ANNDREA WHEATLEY Hi everyone. I'm Anndrea Wheatley and I um, I run resilience training programs where I teach young people how to cope with life. I go into high schools and teach them, plus I also work for (ph)Wiston-Sydney University, um, with aborigine students in high schools, so I go in there and mentor the students and encourage them to do something with their lives, and so that's kind of like a resilience thing as well. Um, I also run a website which has become very popular globally lately, recently, in the last six months in America and Russia, and very popular in China, which is amazing because they don't, they're not allowed to go on their internet that much, um, but I find a lot of young people responding to blogs that I write, psychology blogs, so I'll just keep that going. So that's what they're teaching the heart - not to fear. (ph)Thingies that I've put on some of the tables, um, it's one of the blogs I put out, which I get a lot of feedback and people say "I really loved what you said. Thank you for saying that," or they say "Oh, could you tell us more?" I talked about binge drinking, girls, suicide, drugs, divorce, what young people are going through, and they love it, they love hearing about it, and I try and write from a perspective, a way that they can understand, yeah. So recently I did a blog on um, actually a film called (ph)Maizi, What Maizi Knew. It's about a little girl who watched her parents divorce and how she, how she had to cope with that, um, just the way she saw it from a child, and it was so popular that I got 1,000 people from Sweden the next day straight onto it, and then I did What Maizi's Mother Should Have Known, and what Maizi's mother, The Trouble With Maizi's Mother, so I did a whole lot of things on mothers, but it was good, it was good, but um, my um, area that I talk is building resilience using the power of high self-efficacy, and resilience, as we know previous workshops, uh, the positive things that someone builds in their life, or the negative things that are working against them and it's like scales, and so the positive things will work for a child and the negative things will work against them, and sometimes, they're born with those positive things, um, with intelligence and gifts and talents, and sometimes they're born with a disorder which can be a risk that works against them, and so these negative and positive things they're born with, and then they come into the world and these are negative things working against them. It could be a family where the mother's not gonna nurture them or the area they're living in, there's bad kids around, their school might, the school might be no good, there are things working against them, but we can help them fix up those things, or there's things could be positive that they come into the world with, so it's those things wok against each other all the time, so they're always balancing in the scales, so it's not really, resilience is not really something you're born with. It's something that you can build into someone. It's not a static trait, and i'ts being recognized by most researchers now, that um, especially Siegel's and Casalino, the two neuroscience people that I follow closely in the area of neuroscience, and um, it's amazing, the stuff they come up with, but the brain is very plastic, and our brains can change, so knowing that, that our brain can change gives ope to everyone, that even a child that's born into a bad situation, they an still change, because your brain can change, which is, that's amazing, and it always gives hope to people who are counselors or psychologists or psychotherapists, and um, the fact they can change, the best way they can change is in a trusting, loving relationship where they feel accepted and I think, you know, that's with the parents. Tat's also with, in therapeutic situations between a counselor and client. It's building on that child attachment that they already had at birth. Whether it was good or bad, you can fix it up again, you can lift that attachment. Um, one thing we learned from studies, my own research, and it was also mentioned by other researchers that uh, if you're born into insecure attachment, say, you're born with and you've got parents that don't have time for you, or they neglected you and din't nurture you and you've developed this insecure attachment. As they say, you take it into all your relationships in the future. Well, if you enter a relationship later with a person as loving and accepts you, it'll actually change your attachment style, so you can become securely attached, so another person loving you can change you, and I think that's fantastically amazing. I love that, that we can change, um, so self-efficacy, um . . . Um, so I've just said all that stuff. But self-efficacy, which I had to do a thesis on, uh, it's about believing you can do something, and a lot of kids today don't think they can do things. They're lacking in it; thy're low on self-efficacy. They don't think they can do something, and they have the ability, like someone can think they can't do something when they actually can, like they might be good at maths, say a kid's good at maths and you go "But you can do that," and they go, "No, I can't." They don't believe in themselves. There's a lef-, a lack of self-efficacy, and there's ways that it can be built up. Um, so these self-efficacy (inaudible ). He said uh, self-efficacy is learning mastery over different things, like a baby, when it's born, it learns that, if it cries, it's mastering, it's learning that something will change for it, and it's mother will come to it and fix that, but if it's mother doesn't come to it, it learns that no one's gonna come. That's their world, it's the baby's world, so we learn self-efficacy from the very start, and self-efficacy has become the key, is one of the keys to resilience. I talked to a, um, a very old professor and he said "You know, it's the key. It's the main key of all resilience, believing that you can do something," so if you believe that you can do something - it could be dancing or it could be riding a bike - if you believe you can do it and you get to master it, you'll believe, when you go through other things. If you believe you can go through a problem, when the problems come, you go, I can go through the next problem. You persevere, you learn, your self-efficacy builds, but if you don't think you can and you don't think you can do anything, so you don't do it, your self-efficacy stays low, so a person has to be encouraged and pushed to step out and do it, and as they do something like learning to tie their shoelaces - very basic stuff you start with when you're a child - if they do learn to do that thing, uh, their self-efficacy builds. It, it loops back. Self-efficacy loops back and it builds you up and you go "Right. I can do something else now. I can ride roller skates. I can learn to read and write." You could use that in all areas, so uh . . . Am I using the right . . . People with . . ." Oh, we had to do a thesis on procrastination. We found that young people in university - it was 200 kids that we looked at - uh, if they had high self-efficacy, they wouldn't procrastinate, they'd get their work done, and even if they failed, they'd still carry on, but the ones with low self-efficacy, they didn't believe in themselves, they procrastinate, and if they failed, they'd give up, so we need that self-efficacy built into kids. Um, okay, so the whole thing with self-efficacy . . . The other thing with self-efficacy they found out was, when it's higher and you believe in yourself, you're less threatened when adversity comes your way. When bad things happen in your life, you're less threatened. You go "It's okay. I'll be all right," and as a result, your stress hormones are low, and you'll cope better. The interesting thing is, I found, from Casalino research, and um, a man called Casalino, he's a PhD, a neuroscientist, and also Siegel's was that, when a mother smiles at a baby or holds her baby, the more maternal attention is shown to the baby, the more um, the more receptors that are in their brain for hormones, you know, for chemicals that calm them down, anti-stress chemicals, the more receptors develop in their brain. The less their mother spends with a child, the less care and nurture they have, the less stress receptors are in there, I mean, less chemical receptors, so they're not able to calm themselves down when they grow up cuz they can't; they've been born with less receptors, but as we know, your brain's plastic, and it can change. It's the same when the person is brought up in a secure home and they'e got those receptors, but then they might get trauma down the track, and so it sops it operating, so you go back to a child who wasn't even nurtured - almost the same brain - so it shows how the brain can change all the time. It's kind of plastic, goes backwards and forwards, and um, yeah, those with less, lower self-efficacy, so it's got that those with um, low self-efficacy that are threatened don't believe they can cope, so something comes along, they're threatened, and there's a release of stress hormones, and they have more health problems, so that's why it's really important, the self-efficacy. I know it sounds . . . It's an annoying word, really. Like, my daughter, my (ph)other daughter, she had to proofread my thesis. She goes "I hate this word, and that's what you keep using," but it's just um, it's describing confidence, self-belief, believing in yourself, and we all need that, um, and that was just showing the research that we did, that. That was self-efficacy and it correlated with threat, so as thr-, as self-efficacy went up, threat went down, they were less threatened. As they believed in themselves more, they are less threatened when they came to do academic tasks. This is just for high school and uni, um, and when they're more threat, when they had low . . . Oh, yeah. When they were hi-, had higher self-efficacy, they were challenged by . . . Say a difficult task was given to them and they go "Oh, yeah. I can do this. I'm gonna take this as a challenge." They turned it into a challenge, whereas the one with low self-efficacy, those kids who don't have very high self-belief, they see things as a threat, all things that come along, so it's important to build up their self-belief. um, and there's many ways of building self-efficacy. One way is - for both girls and boys - is mastery. As they master one thing, it leads to another things, and i'ts like the story of the Little Red Engine, but he's actually a little blue engine - I got it wrong or something - but as he went up the hill, he saw the hill. I talked to some kids in Mount Druitt, which is a pretty down-and-out area in Sydney, and I said uh "What did the little engine do when he came to the hill?" and they go "Well, he looked at the hill and he turned around drove off," and I said "No." I said "See, that's where you're at. That's how you see . . ." That's what they would do. I said "No. He pushed himself," and they're like "What?" I go "Yeah, he pushed himself to get up the hill. You have to do that. You have to believe that you can change your life," and see, that breaks helplessness if you can get it young. See, resilience psychology is not um, fixing up people when thy're messed up. It's building them up, preventing them from getting messed up, like helping them now, before they grow up, before they get into something that happens and it becomes a psycho, psychopathological disorder. Help them now. So I said "No, you push yourself and you push yourself up the hill and you go . . . I think that self-talk again, that's counseling. You know the, all the research on self-talk, positive self-talk, "I think I can. I think I can." I said "You say that to yourself, even if you don't think you can. You say "I think I can," and you push yourself." I said "When you get to the top, you'll know that you've done it, and you'll feel the sense of satisfaction and the, it'll loop back, self-efficacy will loop back and you'll feel back, and when you come down the other side, you've built your confidence. There'll be another hill to take, and that's how all of life is. All life is like that. There's another hill, there's another hill, there's another hill. There'll always be more hills, more things to achieve, but more battles, more struggles in life, more things to go through, but we can do it, that's why I try and teach them that they can do that, so that's low self-efficacy. My daughter's a art teacher, not that you can tell that from this, but she . . . I've got three daughters, anyway. So um, they look at it and go "It's too hard. It's too hard. I'm giving up." It's like the little red engine. High self-efficacy: "Looks hard, but I think I can do it," and he gets up and he gets back down. "I can do it; I knew I could." And mastery shows that, as you build up and come down, you've built your self-efficacy, but if you don't prove it, you see that . . . The thing is, when you climb there, you're proving to yourself that you can do something, and a child has to prove to themselves. That's why it's not good if you don't let a child, like, go through their own things, and, and learn to overcome their problems and learn to achieve things themselves. They won't build this up. As my daughter said - she's a school teacher - there's a lot of boys out there that are very weak now, she's found in the high schools. They're very . . . Not much will; not much strength. A lot of them, um, they're mothers haven't let them develop, or they've been over-protected, um, they haven't been allowed to achieve anything. You actually stop them building their confidence by over, over-nurturing. It's very difficult, a very hard line to walk. Like, we need to be there for our children and they know we're there. They need our presence, and we need to talk to them. That's part of building resiliences. One of those resilience factors is a very close relationship to parents will build resilience in them. Um, that takes time, and not being just playing on iPods and iPads and technology. It means actually human time together builds their self-efficacy and builds their resilience as a result. Um, yeah, so when they learn to accomplish something, they come down and it's built up, they're strong, and also, when you learn something, uh, your brain develops to accommodate, so you can never say to a kid you're no good at something, because how can you say that? They're developing; they're gonna be good at it one day. If they learn to give up all the time, they won't develop, actually won't develop in their brain. Say they're learning to roller skate, and they stop learning to roller skate, and as they do, pathways start to form, so that's a new subject, or a skill, singing, dancing - anything - writing, um, so it starts . . . But if they give up, the pathway doesn't develop any further, it stays stunted. It might shrivel up if they never use it again, so it's really important that they keep persevering. Children have to learn to persevere, and they'll grow, and then they'll have that sense of accomplishment. Then um, mild to moderate stress activates neural growth hormones supportive of new learning, so stress can activate growth, so even bad thing happening, if children learn from it, it can activate growth in their lives if they're learning, so one of the um, things I was reading that parents need to learn, and I guess teachers or whatever, um, children need a balance of challenge and support, challenge and support. Support them, but they're challenged at the same time. Some of them just get challenged, challenged, challenged. In different cultures, it's all about achievement. Um, so I get different cultures approaching me on the internet, and a lot of kids, um, well, actually, they all seem to be in their 20s and 30s, like, answering me or giving me feedback, and they're struggling with, it's just achievement, but they're lacking in emotional strength. They haven't learned any because they haven't learned from their parents because their parents have been around enough for them to learn. Um, so, and as they learn that thing, say it's violin or piano, see how the brain, it just grows and grows 'til they pa-, they branch out and then they interconnect and touch each other, and it becomes this, a person becomes this amazing . . . It's just amazing growth. That's what happens if they keep learning, if they keep going. Okay, some things, maybe they're no good at it and maybe they're not meant to do it. You give up and you try something else, but it's, it's always having the attitude that I can do something that um, a child (ph)who's never developed completely. They're developing all the time. Oh, there. Providing um, a child learns from their parents, self-soothing, self-soothing . . . I have to talk to kids in a um, area where it's very, there's a lot of violence, um, and the town that has five campuses of the one high school and they only go up to year 10 because they got such bad marks in the HEC they cut the high school out and changed their name and put them in campuses that only went up to year 10, and then they just had one senior school, and I thought "That's a bit low expectations, isn't it?" But um, a lot of them came from pretty bad homes, and they, I say to them "You're like soldiers. You're like soldiers that have been in a war and you're, like, shell-shocked when you've come from that, so you have to look after yourself now. You need to soothe yourself." Cuz see that's what your mother teaches you. That's why mothers hold their babies and soothe them. It's teaching a child how to cope with stress when they grow up. Who would've thought it starts when you're a little baby? But even neuroscientists have discovered that, and I was just reading a neuroscience book and they kept bringing it up, about the mother, the attachment, always, even though (ph)weren't, the book wasn't even on mothers, it was just on neuroscience. Um, even when a mother smiles at a child, 900 hundred genes switch on positively, 900. She actually changed a baby's brain by smiling at it. Um, whoever the carer is, it has to be that one person, um, at least, um, and also the opposite way if there's a negative situation, but not only that. Um, the baby's, holding the baby changes the mother's brain, her genetics and chemicals in her brain, which is an amazing thing, too, so the more she holds her baby . . . You can see it's not happening with a lot of mothers, because they don't see their babies, are too busy working, they need to get in contact with them again, and it's called attunement, being in tune with your child and your child learns to be in tune with you and you're working together, you know, you're meeting the child's needs and . . . That's attunement. That's why mothers have to be looked after so much and helped. Um, yeah, the other thing they found was, with Casalino that's so interesting . . . I know there's a lot of research with counseling on narratives and when you write your story, it brings down your stress hormones when you go through adversity. It's one of the most powerful ways to bring down stress after trauma is to write it. It will do something that will integrate your brain and bring it together, cuz the brain has two sides which work together, and when there's a trauma, they stop working together, and one side might freeze the other, but we can talk about it later. Uh, if parents talk to their kids, I often say to parents "You give them your heroes. You be their hero. You teach them role models. You be their role model. Don't let the TV give them the heroes. Don't let the internet give them the heroes. You be the hero. Talk about what you did in your life when you were a kid. Talk about the hard things you went through." But I actually found new research, and I was amazed. It was just agreed with me and it just said parents who um, talk about things they've been through to their children, um, in a positive way, a coherent way, meaning that I'e learned through this something good or if they talk to their feelings and things that they've been through in their life, their child actually takes it on board and learns to talk about what they're going through in their life, and when, if that child goes through trauma later, they will actually cope better than a child who's never had that from their parents. It's amazing if a parent talks to their child about what they've been through, so my kids . . . I think they've heard too much. So I was telling . . . (ph)They're (ph)like "Yeah, we heard that. No, we know that one. Yeah, we heard that." Well, they're grown up now. Um, so it makes them able to, when they go through trauma, they will learn to make a story narrative of it and um, process it because of what happened with their own parents, so the parents need to become the heroes and spend time with their kids, and that's um, that's the next thing. I was gonna say sources of self-efficacy . . . I'm gonna come back to this, cuz I thought we'd look at it at the end and um, do some interactive work. What's the time? When do I finish at? Anyway . . . I'll just go through sources, sources of self-efficacy. Okay for boys, mastery is the main source of (ph)out, um, self-efficacy. They build themselves up by mastering things more than anything else. It is also powerful for girls, but for boys, that's their main thing. They need to know that they can master something, and they've gotta master skills, jobs, hobbies, life, problems. You mustn't take it off them, and if they fall down, they learn to get up again, even though you're there to help them and pick them up, um, but let them learn things through their problems. For girls, um, the girls are social persuasion, (ph)vicariously. Both of them learn through um, vicarious learning role models, and that's why I said, parents, you need to become their role models, because they're getting their role models off TV and internet, and they're not good role models. A lot of the role models on TV are (ph)revenge and nasty stuff, and the kids are learning it, and then you've got social network, which, Facebook, but again, so vicarious learning, but for girls, it's their friends, and a lot of research . . . There's one uh, research from France; uh, I think they did 700 kids or from ages 12 upwards, um, and they found that girls are depressed by the significant others in their life, their self-efficacy is depressed. In other words, if girls have girlfriends who put them down, boyfriends who put them down, partners that put them down, husbands that put them down, they all bre-, break their confidence, and that's why it's really important for parents to teach girls to form good friendships. If someone's pulling them down, they're not a good friend. I know it's a silly thing, like a schoolyard thing, but it's actually really important, uh, didn't used to be so important, maybe, because they had that family support, but now that parents are so busy working, they're not watching what their kids are up to. The girls are getting really attacked on social Facebook, Facebook. They're friends are on there making comments to them. Their friends might make a comment that's not even a nasty comment, but it could have a nasty connotation, um, just by saying nothing or they're anxious, they're hearing stuff from the Facebook. In some cases, they shouldn't even be on Facebook, like, they're not meant to be on 'til a certain age, but um, Facebook is making a major place where girls can be pulled down. Of course you know there's a lot of suicide with girls in Sydney and Melbourne, um, from people turning on them, because when they were . . . In our day, we got bullied at school, you know, Monday to Friday if we got bullied. You got the occasional nasty person. But they are getting psychological warfare on their brain 24 hours a day from Twitter, social network of Facebook, their mobiles, and that is enough. They're getting it 24-7; they get it at school all day, they get it at home, they get it on the weekend. Um, I know some mothers had to pull their girls out of private Catholic school where I lived in the mountains. It's a middle class area there. Um, this girl was getting so um, bullied, so she put her in another school kind of thing, and the other thing that's happening with girls a lot is they're self-harming, cutting their wrists a lot, and I think it's all part of this. I've done a blog on it on my internet site, too. That's why I did the site. Well, I did the blogs to see what'd happen and lots and lots of young people are reading it, so it's good, but um, I met a girl on a train one day and she said um, the girls will cut their legs cuz they go to an Anglican private school and they've got long skirts, so they cut their legs cuz parents can't see it, um, and they do it in groups, and I said "Well, that's a new one." I was pretty upset that they were doing it at all, cuz my girls weren't involved with anything like that when they were at high school. They're sort of shocked that it's happening now, and these come from good families. This is not down-and-out. This is professionals' children, so they're in private schools. The principals know. Um, so they're sitting in groups and do it, and I said "Why? Why are they doing . . ." She said "Oh, we just don't feel very good cuz we can't, we feel depressed about ourselves because the media is making us feel depressed," and I thought "Fancy the media doing that to you," but I think if they had good connection with their family and their parents are talking to them and they feel loved, the media couldn't affect them so much, but it is affecting them a lot, and I don't think people realize how serious it is. Um, so to build up her self-efficacy, she needs to have good friends, friends that build her up. I brought out a book called The Power of Words, and words actually can pull you down and build you up, and if their positive words . . . It's just like positive affirmations that we make when we say things. Um, your brain, like they're teaching (ph)the (ph)heart (ph)not (ph)to (ph)feel. Your brain actually hears you, so there's a part of the brain - I think it's fornix. There's one called Broca's and there's one called fornix. One's in charge of speech and one's in charge of listening to speech and comprehending what someone's saying, so thy're very close to each other, so what a person, when they hear and what someone says is coming right in and it's gonna affect them and affect their stress hormones or anxiety, um, and what they say to themselves, that's why I often said to the students at the high schools "save yourself. I'm good. I'm great," and I said "Say that after me." I know you know all this stuff, but I said it to the students. They actually loved it, and I, cuz I used to not been called anything like that, and they said, I said "I want you to say "I am a good person. I'm good. I'm great. I'm loved," and they said all that. They loved it. I said "You've gotta say it everyday." I said "Eventually, your brain will start to believe it cuz it will hear it," and it's the same with the Twitter and the Facebook thing. If they're seeing negative things, it's too much. It's actually overwhelming for a young person. Even for adults. We know even adults have su-, almost committed suicide, (ph)silly (ph)breeze, from Facebook and Twitter and how do you expect a young child to cope with that? They're not coping. I sat with a little boy on the um, plane coming over. He was eight years old and he's on his iPad, he's on his iPod and he's all by himself and I said "Where are you going?" "I'm going to see dad," and I go "Oh, you're brave to go on the plane all by yourself," and he goes "I've been 17 times on the plane" by himself and I went "Oh!", and then he goes, he goes "Sh. I'm gonna watch my iPod now." I went "Okay," and he's very technological, and I'm going "Okay. All right. You go on and watch your I . . ." and he's playing music and he showed it to me and it said (ph)if (ph)K (ph)you - that was the name of the group or the song - he goes "Oh, look, this song . . ." and I thought "My god, does your parents know . . ." He comes from a good family. They're not watching what he's doing. That's what I say to parents: monitor your children, monitor what they're watching. If they take too much negative stuff, it's gonna feed depression, and this poor little boy seemed depressed to me. He was really grown up, but he seemed depressed as well, just probably too . . . I don't know. The usual stuff they go through, and um, social persuasions, evaluative feedback, so vicarious learning in role models and models. They identify with people who are their same age who they sort of look to often, so that's why TV's very powerful for them, that's why no matter what you do sometimes, they'll take after what's on TV or their friends. If they think they're successful, they'll follow them. That's why I think you should be telling them what you did and what you succeeded at, and the hero stories, and also give them heroes from the world, from history, like people in the world that have achieved things, like Edmund Hillary, um, Scott . . . Well, he didn't exactly get there, but the other, all the heroes of the world in history. Give them other heroes, not these ones on TV that they're all about murder and hate and killing and revenge. Um, in social persuasions . . . Yeah, so girls are impacted very much, so to build their self-efficacy, the parents need to make the daughter feel love and they actually should be careful of who she chooses. There was a lady, um, a grandma who um, she brought me her little girl and I said "Where are the parents?" "Oh, she hasn't got any," but she wouldn't tell me what happened to them. She didn't say if they . . . I said "did they die in a car crash? What's happened?" She wanted me to give her resilience counseling, which is what I do with children, uh, and she wouldn't tell me, and I thought "I, how do I know if this little girl's going through grief or not when you won't tell me anything?" She said "She, she is bullied by her friends and she won't drop her friends," and I said "Oh," and she said "And she's much better than her friends." I said "Yeah, but she doesn't care about that," and she said "Why?" and I said "Because she's getting emotional needs met through her friends, and so she'll stick with them, even if they treat her like dirt," so I just um, when I got the little girl, um - that's why I was gonna talk about songs later - I said to her um, "Do you know the story of the Wizard of Oz?" and "Do you know the story of Somewhere Over the Rainbow?" She said "yeah," and I said "Do you have anything you wish for? Do you wanna write down your wishes?" So I used the song. She really loved it, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, Blue Skies. Actually, I put that on my blogs, about Somewhere Over the Rainbow and how some children just wish for their parents to get back together or they wish for a home or they, some kids are hungry and wish for food, um, and it had a big response on there worldwide, but so she said "I wish . . ." she'd write down her wishes and the wishes, some of her wishes were to um, have good friends and things like that, so I just talked to her and I, about that, and she loved talking about that, and I said um "Next time your friends won't let you play . . ." She said "Yeah, they cut me up." It was some school friend she had since the age of three, but now her friend didn't want her, and it's a very small thing, but it's big to them, of course. When they're eight, girls get quite (ph)kitty, and so uh, I said "Next time they don't wanna play with you, you go and find somebody else to play with." She liked that for some reason. I said "Find someone else and um, one day they might want to play with you. The ones that bullied you, they'll wonder what happened," and I said "They won't have any power over you anymore," and so the next time I saw her she was very happy, and the grandma said "Even you just saying that to her, she's really, really happy and she's, and I've taken her to play therapy and all sorts of other things and nothing's worked," so that was good. It was good sort of a helpful, just a little thing, um, so uh, they found that (ph)Alfrey did a study of sports people or um, sports schools - I'll finish with this in a minute - uh, it was young people training different sports schools - I think it was in America - um, and they found that the students who did the best at their sports were the ones who had a caring climate, a caring atmosphere, um, where they were learning and they said that that guy's right across the school home, they, they were the ones that performed better, they had a caring background, and um, they said, when they looked at it, um, the caring environment led to um, better psychological well-being and more psychological adaptiveness to problems in life when things went wrong, and they said this was via emotional self-efficacy, the pathway for this well-being was that they learned how to cope with life through this emotional backup that was happening, and a lot of kids don't seem to have that now, that emotional elf-efficacy or strength in them, because they're not feeling that compassion. They need to feel that, uh . . . Oh, (ph)that's (ph)that (ph)they (ph)are . . . The emotional efficacy, and that happens through caring, feeling empathy and supported, it's that uh . . . Okay. Given the human brain is a social organ, safe and supportive relationships are the optimal environment for social and emotional learning, so even for learning, if they feel cared for, they'll learn better. There's no shortcuts kind of thing. Um, I think I was talking to a businessman recently where we're staying. He said the same happened at work: the men were having breakdowns - (ph)I (ph)think (ph)he's working in the army - the men were having breakdowns, and um, when they, the bosses decided "Well, we'll bring in some strategies and show you . . . And we'll give you breaks and things and not make you work so long" and this, and when they just showed that they cared, the men actually performed better after that on their jobs - air pilots and . . . - yeah, when they knew that their bosses were actually caring for them or trying to support them in some way, they said "We'll give you breaks, we'll change your job around so you're not doing the same job all the time," and they were showing that care, they performed better than just pushing them - "Work, work, work" - it's the same principle, um, and down the bottom, this says social stress can inhibit the brain growing, being stressed all the time, and I think a lot of kids are going through social stress with their friends and at schools, too, while social support, compassion and kindness - it's pretty basic, isn't it? - social support, compassion and kindness support positive brain growth, so in a way, when we're kind to each other, when children are kind to each other, we teach them to be kind to their friends. We're kind to them; they learn to be kind to us. It actually builds up each other's resilience, cuz it's building our brains together, which I think that's amazing. Um, there needs to be a more psychologically adaptive approach to life and our society and culture, one of a caring climate. If we wish to, this to be reflected in our young . . . When our children are really young, they learn empathy. They learn . . . It has become a (ph)narcissistic society, but children learn empathy at one or two from the parent if the parent has taken the time to show that "Okay, I care. I'm listening to what you're saying," and then the child learns to do it with their friends, and then they learn to do it with each other, and then it becomes a growing thing, but children who don't learn that, they grow up. There's a lot of kids growing up now to be little princesses and "It's all about me." They haven't grown out of the two year old stage. They're still back there cuz mommy and daddy haven't taught them to care about other people either. they need to care about - yeah - others, not just themselves, so . . . Oh, that's all. That . . . "Relationships that are attuned, that honor differences and cultivate quite compassionate (ph)convictions are integrative relationships that promote health," actually mental health, and um . . . Well, I was gonna finish with that anyway, but I brought out a new thing called endurance lifestyles and especially in Sydney, where people work themselves to death kind of thing, slaving, slaving, slaving, and they wonder why they're having breakdowns, and their kids, they haven't got time for their kids - work, yes, you need work to grow, mastery, it's mastery, but rest, you need rest, rest is reflection. You need time by yourself to reflect about yourself, and you need time for recreation. I can't overemphasize it, cuz people end up sick and end up with a lot of sicknesses, or they'll drink a lot of alcohol or take a lot of drugs or they'll just get cancer - not all cancer's like that of course - but um, it can be through stress on your body, cuz they still haven't found the link with cancer and drinking. They think it could be the stress that makes the person drink that makes them get cancer, and not the drink that's making them get cancer, the alcohol, so there's correlations, but they're not sure if it's just the stress itself, so some people have never been drinking or smoking, but live very stressful, high-stress lifestyles can get quite, can get cancer, too, (ph)as (ph)um . . . Well, take celebrities like Delta Goodrem, Olivia Newton John. Delta Goodrem was only sleeping three hours a night when she got cancer at 19. She was so busy doing her Neighbours show and recording her . . . You know, it's all success, but at what cost? She nearly lost her life, so . . . And Olivia Newton John . . . I don't know why she got that, but there's a lot of celeb people that live high-stress lifestyles, and I know a lot of people in (ph)Christich where - my old hometown - uh, after the earthquake, those who'd been stressed before, who were (ph)multiply stressed are all sick now, people that I've known, and they've gotten cancers and things. Okay, maybe they wouldn't have gotten cancer in the end. Who knows. It needs to be um, researched, but um, they were under stress before. The ones who were under stress before . . . It really broke the camel's back when the major crisis came, so we need to live um, decent lifestyles that keep us together so we can cope with life now, and when the big things come, you'll cope, but if you're not looking after yourself now when the big things come, you'll fall apart. That's just what happens. You have to prioritize relationships, not wait for the crisis, but relationships, the people that are important in your life, you must make them, like, of importance, make them number-one in your life before work and all those other things and um, yeah, especially children, and then you find your dream. You can find your dream and use your talents and your gifts and go for those things, and I'll just go back to . . . Oh, I pressed something wrong.

Adversity - a different kind of mastery Diagram 4 Mastering Adversity Model (Wheatley 2012) 

00:35:55
Mastering adversity Taking yourself, a child or adolescent through adversity and or less.... • 1. Emotional regulation - needs to be strengthened and maintained (reading and interpreting own physiological and emotional states - affects self-efficacy) • 2. Strategies for dealing with distressing circumstances or emotional stress - self talk, look after self physically - exercise, rest, social support... 

00:35:55
Mastering adversity contd. • Using creative art - art, music, dance, singing, ... To process as such is sometimes the only way. However, writing is one of most powerful processing of experiences. - (Cazalino 2010 p Physical 

00:35:55
Mastering adversity contd. 

00:35:55
Mastering adversity contd. 

00:35:55
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Uh (inaudible) Okay, okay. I'll go back to the 'going through adversity.' Adversity is the same . . . My daughter drew this picture. Um, you've gotta get up . . . It's different. It's another hill to take its mastery again, but you've gotta get up that side, go through that danger stress time to get to the other side, and when you're going up, you have to talk to yourself - "I can do this. I can do this" - to get through that time of crisis, whatever it is you're going through - trauma, um, loss, just a really hard time - um, you need social support - everybody does - practical help from people - we need our needs supplied. If a person feels like they're getting helped, they're more likely to cope than if a person who's not getting helped. Um, they think they're out of control of the situation. It's all about control, uh, whether you see yourself in control of it or not, and if you feel like you're completely over control of it and you're getting no help, you'll go down a lot more, so there's that practical help, social support and stress buffers. We need to buffer ourselves from stress by, yeah, doing things that will help you relax, um, reaching the other side . . . Yeah, it's just getting up there, up that hill, through these different things, um, and I've talked about . . . I did a blog on the monarch butterflies, uh, and have you . . . Anybody heard of those? Um, the monarch butterflies . . . There's three generations; um, breed, they're born, they breed, they feed and then they die within six weeks. The fourth generation - it's either the third or fourth; I'm not sure which one cuz I'e read different research and it changes - um, they breed and feed and then they don't die. They then migrate about 4,000 k's down from California all around the world, these things happen, and they're the only insect that can fly across the Atlantic. They've got these little wings and they fly thousands of miles - it's amazing - so I, I want to model our lives of endurance after the monarch butterfly. Um, but they take time out to rest, to feed, and a lot of them get destroyed on the way by the storms - that's sort of a symbol of our lives - and they make it to their place where they hibernate, and they all cluster together and keep warm, and I sort of see that as social support as well, and they rest in these trees for a few months, and then they lay eggs, and then they fly back and the, and the eggs are born, and they seem to know where to go, too, when they're little butterflies. Anyway, they think it's amazing that the butterflies haven't even learnt they were meant to fly there. How did they know? It's something inside them, but um . . . They thought it was the coldness, but it's not. They just seem to know where to fly, and they never watched anyone fly before them, and so I just say that our generation can be those super butterfly generation, that they can do it, they can keep going on. If they do the right things. Um . . . Oh. One of the other things that builds or drops . . . Uh, all those things that are sources of self-efficacy, they can either build it up or drop it down, so words can build up self-efficacy or drop it down. Mastery . . . If they don't think they can master it and they don't try and master it, it'll drop their self-efficacy down and words and friends and all that vicarious learning, and, but also reading their own states. If they feel anxious, they think they can't do it, so that's where they need to learn emotional regulation - young people, children, adults - and we need to look after ourselves physically. I know it's pretty basic stuff - exercise, rest, social support - and um, I was gonna get us to look at some songs now, because I found uh . . . One of the things I found is the right side of the brain, the right side and the left side of the brain hemispheres . . . The right side of the brain is where the subconscious often is, and when we're (ph)traumad, it's the right side of the brain that's traumad, and that's where our amygdala is, flight-fight response - I suppose you've heard of that, where . . . yeah - so that's where that is affected, and when that happens, and when you're deeply traumad or lost, it freezes the left side, which is the speech side. Your speech is on the left, so the Broca's and fornix part of the brain's on the left side of the brain, so that's when you talk about things. Often, people can't talk about that, because it's frozen, that, so um, they'e also found that music can tap into that, and we need to process things holistically. Casalino . . . I looked up Casalino stuff. We need to process things holistically on the right side. Music comes through the left side, left ear, quite often, hits the right side of the brain and goes straight into the audio part of the brain there, and can often release, help process, but I know one of the most powerful ways is writing the story of what's happened to you when you feel like it, so it hits that side, you process it, could be with dancing, singing or music. Often, music can bring up feelings that are buried, deep feelings, and you don't know why, don't know why they're there or where those feelings came from, why . . . It's just triggering it and it might pro-, help process, and then that releases the speech side and the person can start talking, or so I think. Sometimes, if you're talking . . . Say you do start talking about something and it comes to you that you can talk about it . . . I believe that it goes both ways. It releases that side where it starts processing it, so it's working both ways kind of thing. It's just this uh, neuroscientist, uh, psychologist, he had a woman who was traumad from uh, rape or something when she was quite young, and she couldn't talk, she (inaudible ), she couldn't talk, so he started talking into her left ear, just started saying "It's okay. They can't hurt you now," cuz she went into a freeze when she was in his office. She just went froze; she couldn't talk or move, and he just thought "What should I do?", so he talked into her ear, and somehow . . . He didn't know what happened. He saw her a few weeks later and she could talk about things. It just released it, so it's like that thing of your brain hearing it again. Of course, we know there's a timing when, when you're ready to deal with things, when your brain's ready to release it, so the brain's doing it to protect you, protect you. You know, often, in children, they're not ready to talk about things until much older. It's when your brain is ready to go through it, but yeah, creative things, uh, so he found, yeah, writing's the most powerful. It drops your stress hormones right down - very powerful - um, de-, and it deregulates the emotional activation of the amygdala, the flight part, fight part, where your very trauamad, that part, so actually, it (ph)fix all their chemicals, yeah, the creative arts, so I was gonna say, um . . . Also, when they're going through adversity, people sometimes need something to hang onto, children, young people, and they often will use songs or raps, um, but I've even heard people's stories, heroes, like, people like Ingrid Betancourt. She was taken um, hostage by militants in the Colombian jungle for five years, and she nearly . . . I don't know how she survived. It was amazing. She was this young woman. She had her children and husband left back there and she was taken in chains, often in solitary . . . But what kept coming back to her was the things that her father said to her, so what parent say to their children are gonna see them through the hard times, or anything that someone puts into your life. Um, also, I was reading Casalino after I'd already done the little red engine thing, cuz I found I got this revelation about the little red engine when I was doing my thesis, but he said there was a little boy whose grandfather had died, and he was very close to his grandfather, and one day, the psychologist was doing a game with him, and he said "Should we give up now?" and the little boy said "No. You . . . I think I can. You have to be like the Little Red Engine; you have to go over" and so he'd remembered what his grandfather had taught him, so it's the things that we say will keep children and young people through the hard times, and there are gonna be hard times they're gonna go, go through, so that woman remembered everything her father said for that five years in the jungle, and she's become a Nobel Prize winner from her book that she wrote when she got out, but she was pretty, she went through some pretty horrible, bad times there that . . . Her father died when she was um, in captivity, and her mother was going on the radio, sending out messages to hostages every night for the whole five years, so her mother's support was incredible, too, so anything you say to your kids, they can use that later, so you can use hooks from songs, so that's why I just wanted to um, sort of show you how you can do that, so one of the songs is We Dance On - where is it - Dance on? I thought um . . . I'll give you the songs. Um, so if we split into two groups and - I'll give you two songs - so this group can have We Dance On and this group can have Strong Again, and you can tell me what you think the song's are processing or doing for someone. I'll give them to you.

ANNDREA WHEATLEY Okay, who wants to um . . . Did someone wanna say what they think it's about? Um, I'll get . . . (ph)Rebecca, do you want to take the mic? Who wants to say what they think it's about? I'll pass it along. 

00:46:05

00:46:10
UNKNOWN (ph)It's (ph)about (inaudible ) 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Um, it's about pushing through, being resilient, that you can overcome the obstacles, you can push through, you're gonna make it, you're gonna be okay in the end, even though there might be problems and obstacles to get through first. 

00:46:35
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, yeah. That's good, that's good. That's the sort of thing you can give a young person or a child to say or play the music to them or get them to sing it and . . . It's positive affirmations, isn't it, again? 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think it, it is a, uh, uh, a song of optimism, um, optimism that everything's going to be okay, and I like the line, you know, "With you standing right by my side," so the (crosstalk)thought that you're not your own, there's always going to be that someone (crosstalk)there, but you're strong on your own, too. 

00:47:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah, the, the social support, yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:47:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, you need them both. Yeah, that's good. If you want to . . . Yeah. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Oh, I just agree with what you said about the "standing right by my side," yeah. 

00:47:15
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, and there's a real, there's a lot of research out about the power of other, too. There's a very strong um, significant effect of knowing someone's there for you, just knowing one other person, and I think most suicide, they think no one's there for them, even though people are there for them, but they don't know. They need to know. They need to sense it in here or here. They're not feeling that someone's with them and they just think, if they take their lives, no one cares, but if you can convince them - I've read research on that - if you can convince them five minutes before they do it, actually, they will change their mind if they sense someone cares, yeah. Who's the next person? 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Uh, (ph)a (ph)lighter (ph)tempo is, like, so catchy, so, so full of exuberance. I wanted to get up and dance. 

00:48:00
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, yeah, you can do that. 

00:48:00
UNKNOWN In my culture, we just sit quietly, we don't dance. I found myself (ph)swaying to the beat, and it's not only the beat exuberance, it's just in the music. It is the language. I like the uh, standing up like a soldier. (crosstalk)It's like - yeah - I'm gonna put up a fight; I'm not gonna let go, and I like the self-talk that says "I'm gonna be okay," and it's so repetitive. 

00:48:25
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:30
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, yeah . . . 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN I love that. 

00:48:30
ANNDREA WHEATLEY . . . yeah, and cuz the music's doing into your . . . Apparently, music is the purest form of emotion, of reaching emotion, of showing emotion, cuz they don't know how to describe emotion in psychology. They're still trying to work it out. They say music is the most purest form of emotion that you can feel kind of thing, but often, when kids are going through adversity, they need to know that, um, that thing you're afraid of, that fear part in your brain amygdala, we can turn it into fighting. "I'm afraid. No, I'm gonna fight this" - change the feeling around the fear into fighting, cuz that's fight and flight, that part of the brain that's afraid, so when we turn it around with the music and song, you can turn that fear, like, stand up to the fear. I guess that's what it's doing, standing up to the fear, cuz if you can fight your fear, you've probably won most of the battle than the thing that's being threatened at you, whatever's happening kind of thing. Is someone else . . . 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Um, I just observed that uh, kind of the life itself is compared to dance, like, "dance on, dance on," so life is not work. It's not so bad. It's kind of a dance, and then there's difficult moves to ma-, master, but after you master it, it's like really wonderful . . . 

00:49:45
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah. 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN . . . like, and a lot of the movies like, at first, they couldn't dance, like (inaudible ) 

00:49:50
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yes, mastery. A lot of movies for (crosstalk)young people they bring out is mastery, isn't (crosstalk)it? Cuz they know young people lack (crosstalk)that. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Then they master it. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, and then you feel stronger and you feel more confident. 

00:49:55
ANNDREA WHEATLEY If you overcome that thing. Yeah, when I looked up the background of the movie - um, that was from Street Dance - and they do overcome this . . . They have to . . . These street dance kids have to work in with the ballet school kids and they don't like each other and they don't think they can do it and it goes on like that. All their difficulties and they work as a group and there's all that. Um, when I looked up the song, they wrote it, and they said "This is a song of resilience shown through dancing," and I thought "I didn't even know!" and I had it on my website and everything. I didn't even know. I just really liked the song, so it was showing that. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I liked this, where there's acknowledgement that it's going to be really hard, uh, it's not this "Well, it'll be okay," but there is acknowledgement that it's going to be hard (crosstalk)(inaudible) 

00:50:35
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)It's not just positive talk, (crosstalk)saying "Everything's good, everything's fine," when it's not all right. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)No. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN "But I'm gonna be okay, and with you here beside me . . ." You know, that, that (crosstalk)acknowledgement of us together and standing like the soldier. Soldiers keep going, they keep pushing through to do what (crosstalk)they need to do. They don't lie down and . . . Yeah, yeah. They also know when to pull aside when they need to, so I thought that was interesting as well, cuz (crosstalk)you know . . . 

00:50:55
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, it's like a resolve with your will, yeah, resolve to go . . . (crosstalk)Oh, which bit's that? Um . . . 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Oh, I don't know. I just thought this, you know, I'm gonna be um, (crosstalk)stand-up like a soldier, just a soldier (inaudible ) a soldier, you know, yeah, and then, yeah, and there's (ph)this sense there's an ambush coming, we can hear something coming, so we step to, to one side. We don't just keep pushing on when we know it's absolutely hopeless. 

00:51:15
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Oh, yeah, yeah, "I'm standing here myself, but we need each other," yeah. 

00:51:15
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN We step to one side, rest for that little bit, and then we can push on (inaudible) 

00:51:20
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)And it's sort of like . . . Yeah, yeah, that's good. Uh, I think emotional regulation, you're doing it to yourself, too. You're saying "It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay," which is what you have to say to yourself. It's something your mom, your mom would say to you or your dad or a friend, or you can say it to each other, I (crosstalk)guess. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)You know you've done everything you can. Stay, remain standing and know you're okay. 

00:51:40
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, that's right, that's right, and if you'e got each other, too, knowing there's someone there . . . 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Shoulder to shoulder? 

00:51:45
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, we can help each other, yeah. Did you want to say anything or . . . 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN I, I agree. 

00:51:50
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Oh. Did you want to say anything? The other lady here. Oh, okay. Um, yeah, we should sing that at the end, actually. All right, we will. We can sing that, yes. This one is more of a rap one, (inaudible )

00:53:10
UNKNOWN I think i'ts like a spoiled child, and when he go alone, and when he started realize, like, to be alone and be independent, um, he realized that it's not easy as he was, was growing up, and it's self-talk, like at the "Get better and be strong again." 

00:53:35
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Okay, (crosstalk)that's, that's a different take. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Yeah, like, there's self-talk. 

00:53:40
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Okay. Well, does someone else want to say anything? 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN I think um, that suddenly, they figured out there is something better coming, there were (crosstalk)(ph)already, they might . . . Yes, they might be really low before, and they found out they actually can go on . . . 

00:54:00
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)This is a person in a down state; it's a, it's a sa-, it's a hard, hard song. 

00:54:00
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yes, and they have to . . . 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN . . . and there is (crosstalk)something to look forward to. 

00:54:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk). . . come to that point yeah. And how does the person come to that point when they hve to be, has to, they have to come to that? It has to be processed (ph)in (ph)life. You can't always use cognitive behavioral therapy on someone when they're down. They say don't use it on teenagers or 13 year olds when they're very depressed. You can't do that. They have to process what they're going through, and they're feeling like "I can't, I can't do this." You can't just say "I can do this." No, it's that he's saying "I'm strong again. I'll be okay." He's come through it and he's processed it and he's coming out. That's what I see of it, anyway, but he's feeling helpless before that, trapped, that the same thing's gonna keep happening and "How can I come out of this?", and maybe he needs a lending hand, someone to help him feel like someone cares or something. Did anyone else want to say anything or . . . No? Did any of you want to say anything about it? (ph)Needs the mic (inaudible ) Okay. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN I hope it's . . . Is it on? 

00:55:10
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Uh, I just related to it. I suddenly went back to being 16 years old, and I went through this disassociated time, and when I came out, I think that, before I went into it, it was just black, obviously - I mean, I, I wasn't (ph)even (ph)consciously, but (ph)went (ph)out (ph)of (ph)bat - but um, it was this thing of, for me, is there was this kind of realization somewhere in this place that I went to that it, it somehow could get better . . . 

00:55:45
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, (crosstalk)it's a glimmer of hope. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk). . . and then - yeah - and afterwards, it's like I denied that, like that whole conversation went on between the black and it could gt better, but when I came out I was functional again. 

00:55:55
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Oh, yeah, like you're fighting this (crosstalk)part of you saying "Don't give up" and the other part's going "No, it can get better." 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Yeah, and so I, I, and I came out strong, (crosstalk)and . . . 

00:56:00
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Wow, (crosstalk)that's amazing. 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk). . . this just took me back there, so it was quite . . . I think that's probably . . . 

00:56:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY You know how they say "If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger"? (crosstalk)It will kill you if you don't process it and get through it and you (crosstalk)resolve it, and if it doesn't get resolved . . . 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you didn't have . . . I had no words then for that (crosstalk)experience. 

00:56:20
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)No, no. There is no words sometimes, yeah, and the right-hand side of the brain is known as the retriever. It's retrieving all memories and pain. It's retrieving it. The left-hand side of the brain interprets. The left-hand side of the brain, brain is trying to make, make sense of what's, of what's happened to him, so (ph)you've (ph)gone, sometimes you an't make sense of what happened to our life, so the left-hand side of the brain's going "why did this happen? What is this part?" This part is in the trauma, and it's just retrieving the memories and it's just stuck there. One day, they come together, and when they come together, that's when the person starts healing, and writing is one of the ways it comes together. Music, singing - it can bring it together and suddenly the words come of what you've been through kind of thing. Yeah, I went through this little thing when I broke up with someone, uh, a year ago or something, and I um, I was telling this girl on the train, I said to this young girl, I said "Uh, to process it - I don't know why - I just painted a picture of this boy, this guy, and he was getting . . ." I said "There's a picture of me and there's all tears crying," and then she goes "Ah," and then I go "And then the tears became a river," and I go, she goes "Ah," and I said "And then it sweeps the sky away and he's going "Help, help!" but my tears are rushing them down the . . ." I said "I'll have to make a cartoon," and she cracked up. She thought that was so funny and she loved it, but I said "I think my brain was processing it, and I don't know why. I just felt like I had to draw this picture and I felt . . . It was strange." I just . . . Somehow, I came through it, and it was a deep, deep, broken . . . Hard to explain, and this girl said "Aw," and that's when she started telling me about that her boyfriend had let her down when I told of the picture. She was 15, and then she went to a party and these boys ganged up and raped her, and then she was scared. She started crying on the train, and I was a stranger, and I said "You've gotta go and do something about it," and she said "I've told my mother, and my mother wants to go to the police. I'm too scared," and I go "No, you just find justice for yourself or you're just gonna be depressed. You've gotta do something about this." But it's because I told her that picture she just opened up. There's different ways of reaching teenagers, young people and children. It's not always asking questions. Sometimes you have to share a thing, and movies are very powerful ways of . . . I hate what's on movie a lot of times, uh, in the media at the moment, cuz uh, you know, the horrible ones are very popular - Dead, Dead Man Walking, uh, Dead . . . Yeah, the zombie thing. And I went to the school and I said "Why are you . . ." cuz they're watching it on the internet on their school laptops, and I said "Hey!" and I said "That is gross!" That's right. They were shooting archery into someone, killing someone, and I said "Look." They just killed 'em, run 'em over, destroyed them, knifed them, and I said "Why do you watch . . ." and they go "There's such emotional, good story lines." This is a boy. I said "I thought boys didn't like emotions." "It was so good, and she went out with his . . . His girlfriend went out with some other man and she was married to him, and you know, and he got angry, so he killed him when he shot him with the gun," and I went "Yeah, no, that's really so violent," so I gave them a whole thing on violence and I did a blog about zombies. I've got a whole thing on zombies do not exist, because some kids actually believe they do. I've been to a few high schools, and uh, when I go around the schools and I say "You do know zombies don't exist, don't you?" and they go "No, I, I, I . . .", this boy goes "No, I, I really thought they did." He, he was serious, willing to say that in front of his peers, not afraid of being laughed at. He actually believed it, and this happened about three or four times, and when I talked about, to them about their fears, "I'm afraid of zombies," and I said "You don't need to be cuz there isn't any, so just stop it." Um, I said "You know what? Your brain can play tricks on you." I said "That is why the media is very powerful. You start watching stuff like that all the time, you start to believe it's real," and um, psychosis actually is extreme blurring of reality with fantasy, so a lot of kids are believing the stuff that's on, and that's scary to me. That's really scary, that, because then, you're letting kids, if they're in a violent home or whatever, they can feed off it and they might become violent themselves then. People always say "But I watch violence and I never became violent," and I said "You have good parents. You didn't come from that kind of environment." It all depends on a lot of factors, but if you're feeding on this stuff, and you're believing all this stuff, it's gonna affect somebody." You just need to get a kid with the wrong kind of parenting (ph)happening or hurt enough and, yeah, it's gonna explode into something. Yes? 

01:00:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:00:43
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Oh, Rebecca, do you wanna take the mic? Cuz they, they need to record you on the thing. 

01:00:50
UNKNOWN Um, I heard a really lovely story last night while I was in this spa. There was um, a dad and his young son, and they'd come down to go to whatever the theme park is where the big brother um - Dreamworld, where Big Brother is filmed or something - because the young boy was only 12 and has . . . Um, he told, he introduced himself to me that he has Asperger's . . . 

01:01:10
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Oh, right. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN . . . and that they'd been there to have a look to meet this person off the TV ship, set so they could show him that it wan't real, that you know, that wasn't his friend, it was actually a part of a television show, and so they'd take him there so they could explain to him that it was . . . 

01:01:30
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Wow. 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN . . . it's not real, so it was a really lovely experience, I thought, on the parent's part, that they'd (crosstalk)done this for this little guy, so they could, so the little guy could get a sense that this person wasn't really their friend, it was on the TV and it was all made up and it was filmed at the theme park and . . . 

01:01:45
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah, I'm glad they did that. 

01:01:45
ANNDREA WHEATLEY It's funny, cuz the guy that brought out all the theories of self-efficacy, Bandura, who said we're affected by, if we master something, then we can grow from it and he realized it was neuroscience and all that. He's the same one that's brought out stuff against uh, violent media, and he goes to the White House every year - he's in his 70's or 80's now and presents more and more research about how violence can affect the brain and watching too much of it or . . . So it's the same guy, the same research, famous . . . Bandura. He did all social learning theory, what children learn from their environment and interacting with their environment and the children learn off role models. That's all Bandura, and um, their role models are people that they think are heroes. To them, they're successful. If they think they look successful, they'll copy them. It can even be a baddie in a movie. Like, if they make Superman kill someone, that's okay, cuz he's Superman, so you gotta watch who they're making the heroes and their role model off a lot of TV and internet. It's almost out of control, in a way, so parents need to keep it tight, monitoring, reign and give them other alternatives, alternative heroes kind of thing. I'll just give you . . . Um, you can listen to this one. Um, there's another one.

01:03:55
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Okay, what did you think that song's talking about? What's it processing here? Yeah, with a mic. Oh, pass it. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN Um, just the heartbreak, and he's expressing that emotion while h'es going through it . . . 

01:04:10
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, (crosstalk)yeah. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk). . . and it's probably good to let it out at that time. 

01:04:15
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, yeah, um, and one girl said "Oh, probably some girl broke up with him," and I said "Oh, no. Actually, she died. It looks like it's a death thing here," so it's loss, isn't it? It's always loss, that it's hard to deal with loss. It's something we have to process, but often with music . . . On this song, I often felt like dancing to it, but then, I was a dance, I used to teach dancing to children and was a dance person. It was, to me, it was really interpretive. There's something about it, that you could dance it, I don't know, but it's a way of processing things, too. Is anyone, anyone else want to say what it says and what other things it might be processing? 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN It sounds like um, the whole world is falling apart is falling apart for (crosstalk)that person, and his whole life is not really worth anymore, because of the loss, at the moment. 

01:05:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:05:05
ANNDREA WHEATLEY Yeah, 'til he heals, 'til that person heals again. Does anyone else want to . . . That's a long way. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN Hi. I'm not sure whether it's rel-, relevant but um, the first impression was, like, a co-dependent relationship. I mean, I know . . . I understand that there's like a grieving, but it's almost like his existence doesn't matter anymore because this person is gone, and um, even before she died, there was a time that they broke up before and he was equally broken, and it just seemed like, like he doesn't (crosstalk)have his own identity without her. 

01:05:40
ANNDREA WHEATLEY (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Maybe he's, hasn't got much support or family. Maybe he's, he relied on her, and maybe that was . . . It's possible. And also, our relationships are affected by our attachment as a child to our parents, so sometimes, um, people can be always trying to find that attachment they didn't get from their parents when their parents . . . Even losing your parents, your whole world falls apart, for a child, but here is, like, an adult, yeah, the same thing, and I thought, um . . . Oh, this again. Uh, he thought . . . I guess with loss, it's always like that - you think things are gonna be always the same, and then they changed. I mean, it wasn't what you thought. It's letting the past go, so I say, in a way, that song's trying to find coherence, like, come to terms that things changed and they weren't what you wanted or, and that's probably . . . I guess if you're counseling, you're bringing people through that, that process, and it takes time.
