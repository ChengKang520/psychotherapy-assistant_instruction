Brain-Based Therapy with John B. Arden, PhD 

00:00:40
JOHN ARDEN Hi, my name is John Arden and we're gonna talk about brain based therapy. But, before we do, let me tell you about how that concept, uh, came about. I'm the director of a very large training program in Northern California where by about 130 trainees are trained every year in 24 medical centers across Northern California. And, uh, over the course of, uh, the last, let's say, twelve years, I had become very concerned about where the mental health system is going and most recently heartened about some of the possibilities. First, let me tell you about the concerns. Many of the trainees that come to our program have wanted to find their, what the call their theoretical identity. And that concerned me because, uh, these so called theoretical identities are siphoned off and separated in these little compartments, these, I call them clubhouses. And many of these clubhouses where they're not their CBTs, psychodynamic, DBT, or whatever in DR level four. They're all clubs with various organizational structures and language inherent to those specific clubs. And unfortunately, there has been very little cross fertilization among those clubs. I think we're at the point now, in the history of psychotherapy, where we can integrate many of the research, uh, areas into one meadow, uh, perspective. And this new approach, this integrative approach, integrates a lot of what has occurred in the past in terms of many of these theoretical, uh, perspectives, the psychodynamics, CBT, and, and so on, as well as the diagnostic pictures. So, if you think in terms of a puzzle that we've been trying to put together, uh, really in the last hundred years, a lot of the focus has been in the theoretical clubhouse area. So, we could say that the systems of psychological theory encompasses many of those different clubhouses including the books of bad names. The books of bad names, of course, being the DSM series, and now we have five coming out soon. And many people get, unfortunately, too stuck in those diagnostic clusters thinking of them as discreet disorders that are only responsive to specific types of therapeutic interventions. And I'm not necessarily talking about evidence based treatment, but rather more medicalized, uh, focuses. Uh, nevertheless, this has been part of the picture, that we have the theoretical clubs, we have the diagnostic pictures, and then also, we have the therapeutic alliance. Really, very important. Initially, highlighted by the psychodynamic, uh, perspective, you have transference, countertransference and all that. And later, Carl Rogers with the client centered approach, and most recently, the attachment based theorists. Well, this is a very big part of the picture, and we know from outcome management, uh, studies that the therapeutic alliance is critically important, uh, as part of the, uh, efficacy of psychotherapy. And then, in the last 30 years, we've had evidence based practices that has, uh, really encompassed many of the so-called diagnostic clusters like anxiety and depression, and they're a big part of the picture too. Most recently, and I would say really in the last 10 years, we've had a number of new, uh, perspectives emerge from neuroscience. Now we know what anxiety and depression look like in the brain, what parts of the brain are overactive, underactive, what we can do to help, uh, remediate, uh, um, various, uh, problems. 

00:04:40
Brain-Based Therapy NEUROSCIENCE EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES THERAPUETIC ALLIANCE 

00:04:40
JOHN ARDEN So, If you think of this over all puzzle with those four different areas, (neuroscience, evidence-based practice, therapeutic alliance, system of psychological theories) we can put together a much more coherent, uh, picture of what needs to be, uh, taken into consideration. Now, many people have a difficulty, including myself, in remembering, uh, a lot of different concepts without using mnemonics. So, I like to use the mnemonic base. 

00:05:10
The BASE of BBT Brain Alliance Systems Evidence-Based Practice 

00:05:10
JOHN ARDEN Uh, so that's BASE. And so, the B corresponds to the neuroscience, the A to the therapeutic alliance, uh, the S to the systems of psychological theory, and the E to evidence-based practice. So, let's conceptualize the Grand Canyon as human experience. Whereby, the Grand Canyon is actually the, uh, assortment of hundreds of canyons that make up the Grand Canyon. If you spend your time in one of these canyons, you can't see the other canyons. You can think of the world being all encompassed in that one little canyon, but those canyons have tributary rivers and streams that all flow down to the Colorado River at the base of the Grand Canyon. So, we've got to include when we're thinking about human experience and helping people with complex problems, we've got to be thinking about the confluence of all these factors. And I'm not talking about eclectic perspectives where it's like bags of tricks and, and all that. We need a meta-approach whereby we're including all these confluence factors. So, let's talk about where we have been that has actually set the stage for where we are going. So, if you think about the hundred years or so between, let's say, uh, 1890 and, uh, the 1980s, we could say that that was the Cartesian era. And why do we call it the Cartesian era? Well, think of Rene Descartes and dualism. We didn't know much about the brain. In fact, despite the fact that Freud was a neurophysiologist and wrote roughly about 100 papers on neurophysiology like the anatomy of the cray fish and all that. Uh, he abandoned the brain because we didn't know much about the brain. And, uh, it wasn't until most recently that we developed a better understanding of what the prefrontal cortex is all about. And how important it is for ethic regulations. So, that period between roughly 1980 and the 1980s is the Cartesian era, and a lot of what occurred during that period was a plethora of different theoretical schools. We had everything from radical behaviorism all the way to primal screen with so coherent grounding among them at all until about 1980. 

00:07:55
The "Pax Medica" After the Cartesian area and Eysenck etc. -80s brought us; -the DSM-III-Prozac -Evidenced-based psychotherapy -The medicalization of psychotherapy -Lots of money 

00:07:55
JOHN ARDEN And the new development in 1980 is what a like to call Pax Medica. And it developed, in part, because the Cartesian era produced research that showed that actually, psychotherapy wasn't very effective. In fact, if you can think back at, uh, the really, the nature study by Hans Eysenck in 19, uh, 51 that found that the mere passage of time was as effective as psychotherapy. That was a big blow to psychotherapist. And then, even a, a fellow by the name of Timothy Leary who actually was a pretty bright guy before he started taking acid and flipping out and all that. 

00:08:30
Outcome Data -43% of patients recover without therapy -Therapists are poor judges, not just of the outcome of a complete therapy, but even of a single session -We overvalue our own competence and undervalue that of our colleagues: -80% of the therapists consider themselves "better than the average" therapist -Psychotherapy can produce enduring adverse effects 

00:08:35
JOHN ARDEN Uh, he was the chief psychologist in a system I work in, and he did a study, uh, that found that people on the wait list did as well people in psychotherapy. So, you can see that things weren't going so well for the psychotherapy research world until, actually, the Smith and Glass studies. Now, the Smith and Glass studies were phenomenal. Unfortunately, a little too late because at the same time that we found through this meta analysis that Smith and Glass did that psychotherapy actually works, that there were a number of other factors that super imposed upon that. And those factors being the SN3. Wow. The SM3, so much larger than the SM2. I mean, there was more science to the SM3 than there was the SM2. Words like neurosis were thrown out, and PTSD were put in. And I remember I was down in an academic department as the University of New Mexico at the time, and we said 'wow, I, this is amazing. This DSM3 this is so much better.' So, that was one of the foundations for this period. Uh, my good friend and colleague Lloyd Lynford and I call Pax Medica, uh, to build in a medical model. The next major foundational concept for the medical model was the introduction of the SSRIs. 

00:10:05
Pax Medica: Side Effects -Medications removed psychology from psychiatry and moved psychology toward medicine -Patients receive treatment -Problems became diagnoses per the DSM-Diagnoses determine interventions -Therapists became clinicians -"Medical Necessity" 

00:10:10
JOHN ARDEN My god, antidepressants that don't kill you with an overdose. That was a significant advance because if you think about what was occurring in psychopharmacology at that time trisect-like antidepressants and AMAOs, they cause big, bad problems if you overdose on them. You could die with a TSO overdose. So, the introduction of the SSRIs major advance, and then you had the evidence based practice. And the evidence based practices were essentially, wow, you do this with that particular disorder and that with that particular disorder. And all this got tailed into this overall concept of Pax Medica. So, a play on words again, if you will, uh, similar to Pax Romana whereby you can travel anywhere in the Roman world 2000 years ago and as long as you've practiced Roman law, don't insult the Roman gods, everything's cool. Well, similarly, since roughly by 1980, as long as you didn't insult who's in charge, the medical model, and think that what treatment is the king, and that is psychopharmacology, everything's okay. 

00:11:20
Cracks in the Empire SSRIs Revisited -A re-analysis of all studies of antidepressant effectiveness revealed that while all 38 positive studies were published, only one of the 40 negative studies made it into print -Positive studies 12 times more likely to be published than studies finding negative results 

00:11:20
JOHN ARDEN But, now there are major cracks in Pax Medica. Uh, and a number of studies have come out and fairly, uh, substantial journals like the journal the American Medical Association, the journal of medicine and others showing that the efficacy of antidepressants is way over blown. And, in fact, many people like (ph)Kirsh and others argue that it's roughly just a little bit better than a placebo effect. So, the medical model has significant problems, and it's a one dimensional model. So, what we're emerging into is a far more comprehensive multidimensional model that describes the confluence of all these factors together. So, what is brain based therapy? Now, you can come up with another term if you want, and, um, let me say, uh, to begin with that brain based therapy is not reductionistic. In fact, I was and still am, uh, very appreciative of psychodynamic theory. Certainly, I've spent a lot of time, uh, around and with, uh, CBT and DBT, uh, therapist and practiced for quite a long time, roughly about 25 years ago, the Ericksonian hypnosis and, and actually as a young man traveled around the world, uh, meditating in Ashrams and, and all that. I'm still that person. And so, when we talk about brain based therapy, it isn't a reductionistic, only neuropsychological approach. It is a approach that encompasses this Grand Canyon. It's got a deal with the brain certainly, no question about it. But, memory research and, uh, cognitive development and emotional and attachment research, all a big part of this over all perspective, including psychotherapy research. Not only evidence based practice, but the outcome management studies. So, brain based therapy, you could say, is a assortment of streams of research all adding to this confluence. And it has shown that we need to pay very close attention to how we can actually create neurophysiological changes in the brain. 

00:13:40
GESTALT THERAPY VERBATIM Frederick S. Perls 

00:13:40
JOHN ARDEN Now, (ph)Frits Perl said long ago, back in that classic 1951 book, Gestalt Therapy, that people need a safe emergency to change. So, they need to be a little bit of a, have a little of a discomfort, but at the same time get that support and that backing through the therapeutic alliance to move ahead. Much like parents encourage their children to kind of go out. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:15
JOHN ARDEN We encourage people, our kids, certainly we would, we should encourage our clients to challenge themselves. And that challenge creates the safe emergency because we're behind them. There are also certain neurophysiological explanations for why the safe emergency is so critical. It has to do with the level in our (ph)epinephrine, a critical activating neurotransmitter of the brain. It also has to do with the level of glutamate which is the principle activating neurotransmitter of the brain. It's essentially that work horse in the brain. And the so-called ANADA receptors that are critically involved in neuroplasticity. So, you need a moderate degree of activation. 

00:15:00
Optimum RLS symptoms Threshold for RLS symptoms Normal range Dopamine concentration Drug naive patients Augmented patients 

00:15:00
JOHN ARDEN So, many people talk about the inverse U. And we know that the inverse U factors in when the prefrontal cortex is activated. The (ph)moderducerra activation. So, were wanting to make neuroplastic changes with our clients that necessitate a safe emergency, favoring activating the prefrontal cortex. 

00:15:25
Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Orbital Prefrontal Cortex 

00:15:25
JOHN ARDEN Now, there are a number of major new developments in neuroscience that I think need to be incorporated sometimes actually in the dialogue with us and our clients. Let me review them that I think are very useful as a consensual frame. 

00:15:45
Affect Asymmetry Set points LEFT FRONTAL LOBE -Positive emotions -Approach behaviors Labeling thoughts and feelings and -Developing new narratives (helps to alleviate anxiety and depression) RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE -Negative emotions -Withdrawal behaviors -Feeling overwhelmed -Alexithymic pts, have smaller right ACCz larger right ACCs- more fearfulness and 

00:15:45
JOHN ARDEN First of all, affect asymmetry. A lot of major research, uh, on how the two hemispheres and specifically the two prefrontal cortex, the right and the left prefrontal cortex, process emotion differently. Uh, Robert Robertson, a neurologist that, uh, um, Washington University in St. Louis and, uh, uh, Richie Davidson from University of Wisconsin, have shown through numerous studies that overactivation of the right prefrontal cortex in indicative of anxiety. Underactivation of the left prefrontal cortex is indicative of, uh, depression so, you see that affect asymmetry. And then, also Joe Ledoux from NYU has done a huge amount of research on the amygdala and the fast and the slow tracks to the amygdala. Uh, critically important when we're talking about anxiety disorders. 

00:16:35
Neuroplasticity -Nueroplasticity is a general term that describes changes in the brain as you experience and learn (illegible) -Neuroplasticity involves many changes to the brain including: -New synaptic connections -Strengthening of connections through LTP -The growth of new dendrites (dendritogenesis) -Neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons) 

00:16:35
JOHN ARDEN Uh, and neuroplasticity. Well, that's about rewiring the brain so, I'm always using, uh, language that's more easily, uh, remembered by our clients. So, instead of saying neuroplasticity or neuroplasticity with my clients, I say rewiring thebrain to describe how, in fact, the brain can be rewired or through neuroplastic change. And then also, another major development, uh, in, uh, neuroscience is called, uh, neurogenesis which is, uh, um, actually, a very hopeful development for, for a heck of a lot of people because, uh, now we know under certain conditions, new neurons can actually be developed in specific parts of the brain. So, uh, Fred Gage, uh, down in San Diego, Elizabeth Gold at Princeton have shown that various areas of the brain like the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex can actually grow new neurons under certain conditions. And one of those conditions is aerobic exercise. And, in fact, let me make a few points about aerobic exercise that I think is so exciting. It turns out that aerobic exercise is as effective as antidepressant medication, is as effective as psychotherapy, is as effective as psychotherapy and medication combined. So, with all my depressed clients, I'm getting everybody out there doing something. Fast walking would do it. You just come back, you know, with your heart pumping, and, uh, some sweat and everything. That's a big boost. And, think of this, up to 19% of chronically depressed people have shrunken hippocampal areas. And some people believe that it has somewhat to do with the block of neurogenesis. So, if you can reverse that through exercise, wow, that is incredible. And we also know that people that have been traumatized or under chronic stress over a long period of time because of the cortisol bath leads to the atrophy of the hippocampus. So, you can see the neurogenesis is a critical part of our therapeutic, uh, approach. I actually think that, uh, talking about the brain in therapy serves a lot of really good purposes. One it conceptualizes what we are doing together. So, it, often times clients, uh, come to me, and they're a bit confused by all the therapists that they have gone to before that might have been talking about interjected self objects or, uh, cognitive, uh, changes that need to take place and all that and get lost in the language, so to speak. But, most people are comfortable talking about their own brain. In some ways it's almost paradoxical. It's similar, uh, to the narratives concept of externalizing the problem, but the paradox is it's an internalization of the problem. So, if you think in terms of helping a person understand what might be going on in there brain like, for example, the overactive amygdala, the fast track is on too fast and so on and so forth. They get an idea of oh my god, so you're gonna be helping me tame the, my amygdala, right? And often times, by the way, I, uh, rather than use the word amygdala, that's really a mouthful, hard to remember. I sometimes just say, and you'll see with our client later, I say "Well, you can think of it as Amy." And, taming Amy is a whole lot easier, if you think about it, then taming some complicated, uh, Greek term, you know, amygdala which means all in, by the way. So, talking about the brain in therapy helps conceptualize what you're planning to do with them or some of the homework that you're asking them to do because then they can know that this behavior or that behavior, uh, has something to do with my brain rather than some fancy theory somewhere. So, in this session that you're gonna be seeing, uh, I'm talking about the brain with our client just so she can understand what we need to do together. What challenges are ahead of her that will help her rewire her brain? With all of my clients, I'm thinking that a good foundation is critical. So, on an ongoing basis, I'm asking them to practice healthy behaviors. And rather than give them a whole series of healthy behaviors that they might have to put down in a pad to keep in their pocket, I'm using mnemonics. 

00:21:20
5 Healthy Habits Planting SEEDS S--Social Medicine E--Exercise E--Education D--Diet S --Sleep Hygiene 

00:21:20
JOHN ARDEN So, a mnemonic to remember that I've been finding is fairly, uh, useful to use with clients is called SEEDS, planting SEEDS. So, each letter in the word seeds S E E D S corresponds to a healthy behavior. So, the first S is social support. Now, we know from a huge amount of research that people that are socially isolated get more depressed and get more anxious. We also know that people that are socially isolated, uh, get dementia earlier, get the symptoms of dementia earlier. And we also know even down to the chromosomal level that people that are isolated and lonely later in life have shorter telomeres, these are the caps on the ends of the chromosomes. A short chrom-, uh, telomeres leads to accelerated aging. So, social support, critical factor. The first E is exercise. Now, as I said before, exercise is as effective as as antidepressants, as as effective as psychotherapy and as as effective as psychotherapy and, uh, medication combined. And it also is a way to spur on the development of neurogenesis. So, with neurogenesis, uh, one of the amazing substances that has been identified, is called brain derived neurotrophic factor, and many people are now calling it miracle grow because they can't remember BDNF or brain derived neurotrophic factor. Uh, so, that's one of the many, many neurochemical changes that occur with exercise. From 10 minutes of exercise you'll get 90 minutes of energy. You'll get up regulated, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. In addition to that you'll get more gaba. So, it has an anxiolytic effect, and it has a energetic effect as well. So, exercise critically important, and you don't need to put on a fancy leotard and all that like I was talking about before. Fast walking will do it. 

00:23:30
5 Healthy Habits Planting SEEDS S--Social Medicine E--Exercise E--Education D--Diet S--Sleep Hygiene 

00:23:30
JOHN ARDEN The second E is education. Now, if you're not learning something new, you're looking in the review mirror. And we know that people that spend a whole lot more time learning about new things, especially late in life, have better cognitive reserve. They get the symptoms of, uh, dementia much later than other people. Uh, and people that are anxious and or depressed, if they are thinking only about their anxiety and their depression, they're gonna get more anxious and more depressed. Learning about something new enlarges the scope of their, uh, their life. Their life means a whole lot more. And they get excited if you can encourage them, and you might be thinking "oh my, how am I gonna get somebody that's depressed to be excited about learning?" Le arning builds. It becomes infectious after a while. As you learn, you want to learn more and more and more. Our job is to encourage learning. So, education, critical factor. 

00:24:30
5 Healthy Habits Planting SEEDS S--Social Medicine E--Exercise E--Education D--Diet S--Sleep Hygiene 

00:24:30
JOHN ARDEN Now, diet for the D is absolutely fundamental. What we eat has a lot to do with what we feel and how well we can think. It's not a symptom only. It is also a cause. It determines who can create neuroplastic change, and who not. Too much, for example, bad fats, trans fatty acids, saturated fat, and so on or, uh, simple carbohydrates impair the brain's capacity for neuroplastic change and lead to all sorts of really, uh, incredibly destructive problems like metabolic syndrome and certainly diabetes, uh, too and so on. So, diet critically important. It's our job to review what a person is eating, and I don't ask them are you eating three balanced meals a day? It could be crap. I want to know what they're eating. And I want to know, uh, whether or not these are balanced meals, at least three, maybe four, small balanced meals a day. 

00:25:30
5 Healthy Habits Planting SEEDS S--Social Medicine E--Exercise E--Education D--Diet S--Sleep Hygiene 

00:25:35
JOHN ARDEN Sleep is the final S. The dean of all sleep researchers William Dement from Stanford did a study long ago that found that physicians get at most 20 minutes of education in sleep. And that 20 minute clump of time, that little bitty clump of time, is on what medications to give. And most medications screw up the sleep architecture anyway like, for example, the benzos that are often given, too often given to people to, supposedly, help them sleep shrink the amount of deep sleep which is absolutely, uh, important for the boosting of the immune system and, and so on. So, deep sleep is critical. Stage four sleep is absolutely important. So, uh, helping people get better sleep hygiene and teaching them good sleep hygiene techniques is very important. So, SEEDS is a foundation. Seeds must be planted on a regular basis with everybody that we see. With the client that you'll be seeing in a few minutes, you'll find that what I, uh, initially try to do is to normalize the experience and to reassure her because most of our clients that come to us feel that they have these incurable diseases of the mind or their genes are bad or, or something. And, by normalizing the experience, it gives them much more of a tangible, uh, feeling for what might be, uh, available to them. It gives them a sense of hope. So, my initial job is to actually develop a sense of hope and to normalize her experience. Also critically important is to develop a foundation to build from. So, you'll see that I talk a lot about these SEEDS elements and in my, uh, review of what she might be experiencing I'm finding that her diet is, is way out of whack, and, and of course we know that, uh, really impaired diet with alcohol and she's certainly no alcoholic, uh, but with a little bit of alcohol can destabilize neurochemistry. And it's very difficult to build a house on sand. So, we really want to build a house of firm ground. So, that's one of the things that I, I try to do. What you don't see in this video is the long, um, interview whereby I try to get a sense of the attachment dynamics or history of cognitive development and all that that I think is absolutely, uh, critical for our understanding. I mean, we used to say when I used to teach psychological neuropsychological testing, uh, years ago, uh, history, history and history are very important in any assessment. Uh, so, for the interest of time, you're not gonna see a lot of that history gathering and everything else. You'll see her make reference to the fact that we did that, but nevertheless, it is very important to cover that ground. So, Daphne, what has been, uh, what's been going on? 

00:28:50
DAPHNE Well, um, I just, um, you know, that, I've just been really feeling stressed out and kind of anxious. And, um, I don't really, can't really, you know, can't really tie it to anything. I guess it started about a year ago and I guess, um, I got promoted, and so I've had a little bit more responsibility at work. And, um, I, so it's just kind of, I just don't feel settled and centered. And, um, and now and then lately, it, it seems like it's sort of, things are piling on and lately, um, you know, I get really freaked out if I have to cross a bridge or something. And so, um... 

00:29:40
JOHN ARDEN Did, uh, the bridge, uh, problem happen before the promotion or was it afterward? 

00:29:45
DAPHNE No, it was, it was afterwards. It's just probably been in the last six months. 

00:29:50
JOHN ARDEN Wow. 

00:29:50
DAPHNE That I've been, been having that, um, problem. 

00:29:55
JOHN ARDEN And when you were promoted, did you feel like you were ready for the promotion and all the new, uh, duties? 

00:30:00
DAPHNE Well, I mean, I've been working there for awhile and I expected it, but, you know, it's, you're never really ready for that next step. And, um, so, you know, I was happy to get it, but, you know, there's been a lot, I guess it sort of adds up to more than I thought. And then, on top of that, you know, with the recession, we've been cut back so everybody's kind of, um, doing more than, than probably eight hours of work a day. So, so it's been, I mean, I'm, I'm glad to have it. I know I'm lucky cuz, you know, to have a job at all, but, um, think it's a little bit more than I expected. 

00:30:45
JOHN ARDEN Mm, so, prier to the promotion, were you doing fairly well? Were you feeling confident, and were you feeling any anxiety at that point? 

00:30:55
DAPHNE Um, no, I, you know, I was feeling, you know, I had a great childhood as I was mentioning before and, um, you know, I'm still pretty close to my parents. And, um, you know, even high school, everything was great. And then, I just sort of, you know, rolled along through college and, and professionally. And just, all of a sudden this sort of anxiety thing just got started. 

00:31:20
JOHN ARDEN Out of the blue. So, you really never really had much anxiety before. or depression. 

00:31:25
DAPHNE No, no, no, I, you know, I've, and that's why it's, you know, really kind of, uh, throwing me through a loop. And I, I really kind of started to feel like I'm going downhill with this, this new bridge phobia. And so, so, I wanted to kind of really get, get, uh, a good professional opinion. 

00:31:45
JOHN ARDEN Uh-uh, okay. And what have you been doing to sort of try to get yourself out of this rut? 

00:31:55
DAPHNE Well, um, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, it's really important to sleep. And so, I, uh, was having some trouble sleeping and, coz I would just go to bed and then just things would just go around in my head, I'll think about the next day. So, lately I started just, um, you know, have a couple of glasses of wine before I go to bed to help me relax. And, um, but then, you know, for some reason I start waking up in the middle of the night. Um, and then, I can't get back to sleep, and then I have to go to work. And so, I'm all, you know, I'm not fully rested. I go to work, and it's just kind of sort of builds on itself. 

00:32:30
JOHN ARDEN Hmm. And you have what for breakfast? 

00:32:35
DAPHNE Oh, breakfast? Um, I don't really know. I don't really, I mean, I don't know. I don't really feel, I think everybody is, is... I don't know, I just don't really feel like eating then/ 

00:32:50
JOHN ARDEN Mm. So, you, you skip breakfast as well? 

00:32:50
DAPHNE Well, I mean, well I have, you know, like I have a coffee to get going. You know, usually, um, so, so that kind of, you know, gives me some kind of a boost. 

00:33:05
JOHN ARDEN To get that jolt. 

00:33:05
DAPHNE Mm-hmm. 

00:33:05
JOHN ARDEN And do you sort of crash a little later? 

00:33:10
DAPHNE Well, um, yeah, but that's, you know, that's pretty much, I think that's pretty normal. I mean, my coworkers, you know, do the same thing. 

00:33:20
JOHN ARDEN Mm. And then when's your first meal? 

00:33:25
DAPHNE I usually, you know, take in, like, an early lunch of like, um, try to sneak out at 11:30 or something. And, um, you know, I guess I'm under a lot more pressure at work to get everything done. And, and we can't, you know, take these long, luxurious lunches. So, I just dash up to Starbucks and just get, um, get a latte or something? And, and they usually have some pretty good muffins and stuff like that. So, I'll have one of those. And that kind of, kind of keeps me going. 

00:33:55
JOHN ARDEN Mm. For, for a little bit of time? 

00:34:00
DAPHNE Well, yeah, usually till about, like, um, you know, mid-afternoon. And then, you know, they have, there's always, you know, candies and stuff at work. Definitely, you know, grabbing those. And, um, and then usually I just grab, you know, a coke or something and that kind of gives me another. You know, it keeps me going until, till the end of the day. 

00:34:20
JOHN ARDEN Hm-hmm. You know, a lot of people actually, uh, resort to these artificial means of, uh, boosting their energy like the coffee on an empty stomach in the morning. Doesn't it kind of feel like you just get this incredible boost and have that "wow, got up, okay, I think I could handle this." And then, after you go through the Starbucks, uh, later, then you get another little boost. But it, it sort of tales of doesn't it? Do you, do you find that you can end up feeling a little bit more anxious afterward? 

00:34:50
DAPHNE Oh, well, I guess, now that you mention it, I guess so. 

00:34:55
JOHN ARDEN Hm-hmm. And then at night, uh, when you have the wine, I would imagine you feel, uh, a little more mellowed out right? And, unfortunately, it lasts for about two, two and a half, three hours and all that, and then the hallmark to what we call mid-sleep cycle awakening, like waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep, is the hallmark of alcohol use at night which, unfortunately, kind of messes up all the brain chemistry to give you this uncomfortable feeling of free floating anxiety and all that. So, to work with you on establishing a really good foundation so we can work on rewiring your brain so you can actually feel less anxiety and meet this, uh, important challenge in your life. We want to get a good foundation of brain chemistry by applying a really good balanced diet. And, if you don't mind me saying it and, you know, I live in the wine country in northern California, and when I tell people, uh, it might not be a good idea to drink wine at night, you'll get better sleep, they say "Ah, but it's good wine. It's a hundred dollar cap" and all that. You know, who cares if it's Thunderbird or hundred dollar cap or, or whatever, still the same effect. So, I'm wondering if we could start with a really good foundation, and then build on that foundation some skills to manage the, uh, anxiety and, uh, help you meet the challenge. Sounds like the, the promotion was over all a good thing. 

00:36:35
DAPHNE Yeah. 

00:36:40
JOHN ARDEN And you really want to have all your resources available to you to be able to meet this challenge. Uh, so, maybe what we can do is, uh, work on that foundation, build on that foundation so that you can learn coping skills. 

00:36:55
DAPHNE So, I've been, you know, with this bridge things. And, uh, it's just really getting in the way. And I just feel like my life is, the quality of my life is not what it was. And I was want to get back to, uh, you know, sort of a good standard. Is, uh, is there any hope? 

00:37:15
JOHN ARDEN Oh, absolutely. You know, anxiety is one of the most common, uh, psychological, uh, problems that most people have and the most easy to over come. Uh, so what we're gonna be doing over the series of some sessions is working together to help you kind of rewire your brain, so to speak, so that you can meet this challenge. And to being with, this first session we wanna identity those, uh, things that you might be doing that might, uh, contribute to, uh, making it a little worse. And we wanna build a really good foundation to work from so that you'll be much more successful. 

00:37:55
DAPHNE Oh, that sounds just great. 

00:37:55
JOHN ARDEN Great. In this, uh, next session, you'll see, uh, go through a kind of a psychoeducation of what's going on in her brain, uh, with anxiety. We're gonna talk about the amygdala. And instead of using the term amygdala, I say, uh, that you can think of, uh, it's taming Amy that we'll be talking about We also talk about the difference between right and left prefrontal cortex whereby we know that people with anxiety disorders seems to be hyper active in the right prefrontal cortex. And, interestingly, one way to keep the right going or even getting going even more, kindle, uh, is to avoid or withdraw. Well, she has been doing a lot of avoidance. And so, she started with a little job stress and it got worse and worse and worse as she pulled back from what made her somewhat stressed. In fact, she even developed a bridge phobia. And you won't see in this video, I'll work on the bridge phobia, but that certainly was, uh, one of the, uh, focuses of subsequent, uh, sessions. She gave me an opportunity to talk about neuroplasticity. She brought into the next session, she said " you said something about rewiring the brain. Well, do you think that's possible?" And that gave me that, uh, opportunity to talk about how neuroplasticity occurs. With a moderate degree of activation, doesn't occur by sitting in your comfort area, but rather she has to get out of her comfort area. 'Do what you don't feel like doing,' that's a phrase I use a lot because otherwise, you keep on doing what you've always been doing. So, it was a way to kind of package in an understanding that she had to actually break out of her comfort zone to make that neuroplastic change in her brain. And, as a result of that then, her prefrontal cortex and in especially her left, uh, uh, prefrontal cortex is going to be better at taming Amy, inhibiting the overactivity of the amygdala. You'll see with this client that she is ready for change, highly motivated. And let's face it, many, uh, of our clients take a lot longer, need a lot more sessions to get where we wanna be. Nevertheless, she gets there. 

00:40:30
DAPHNE You said something in the last session about rewiring my brain. Um, what did you mean by that? 

00:40:40
JOHN ARDEN Well, think of this, that we are basically, uh, composed of habits. Some habits are really good habits, you know, some habits are not so good habits. And we can say that anxiety is kind of like a bad habit. And, for whatever reason, um, you developed during this past year or maybe even the last two years, but probably more so the last year, a bad habit. And that habit just doesn't feel so good. And , what we wanna do is develop a better habit and a better habit is feeling more comfortable and confident and all that. And habits, basically, are ways that the brain fires. And so, when we say rewire the brain, it's based on the whole concept of neuroplasticity which means, in a sense, that the brain gets to fire, uh, with particular patterns of firing together. And when you develop a new habit, you develop new ways that the brain is firing together. So, rather than use the word neuroplasticity, we could just say rewire the brain. And, to rewire the brain, to rewire your brain so you could feel much more confident, uh, actually, what we're gonna, uh, have to do is get you to some territory you don't feel like, uh, right now. So, if you can kind of think of you're kind of a, a little young to remember a phonograph, but you know what I mean by phonograph? 

00:42:10
DAPHNE Yes, I do. 

00:42:10
JOHN ARDEN You know how there, there can be a broken record? 

00:42:15
DAPHNE Right. 

00:42:15
JOHN ARDEN And, uh, you can maybe go sit down on the coach and let the phonograph goes over and over and it goes blowing in the wind, blowing in the wind, and you have to get up and bump the needle so it can develop a new groove, so to speak. So, what we have to do is work together so that you can develop some new grooves or some new ways that your brain fires and wires together. That means challenging yourself in ways, uh, that you don't quite feel comfortable yet about. 

00:42:50
DAPHNE But, won't that create more anxiety? 

00:42:50
JOHN ARDEN Initially, it will, but over all you're gonna feel less anxiety because really what you've been doing as I understand it is, is trying to protect yourself against the anxiety. 

00:43:00
DAPHNE Oh, yes. 

00:43:05
JOHN ARDEN And, what we've, uh, found in, in, uh, research, uh, recently in the, uh, area of psychology and neuroscience is that, uh, after a period of avoidance, of things that make you anxious. 

00:43:20
DAPHNE Mm-hm. 

00:43:20
JOHN ARDEN The dominance of your two hemispheres shifts. You get more right frontal dominance than left frontal. And right frontal dominance means, essentially, avoidance. You avoid things that make you anxious. Or you withdraw and we know that people that are overly anxious seem to have more activity going on in the right prefrontal cortex. So, I guess you could say that what we need to do is to get your left prefrontal cortex activated. And, what the left prefrontal cortex, does is does specific things. And, in fact, I want to underline the, the does because it's about what we call approach behaviors. So, it's about doing things even though you don't really feel like doing them, but we've got to do them over and over again, incrementally challenging yourself, and while you're doing that, you're gonna feel less and less anxious, but initially, you'll feel some anxiety. But, we're not gonna flood you and freak you out and create all sorts of panic attacks and all that. But, incrementally, work together so that you can rewire your brain. 

00:44:35
DAPHNE Wow. That sounds, sounds hard. 

00:44:40
JOHN ARDEN It, it'll probably feel a little hard, uh, initially, but we're gonna work together and, uh, it's not like I'm gonna tell you to go run for president tomorrow. But, uh, what we're gonna do is, uh, incrementally work towards you, um, experiencing some things you didn't think that you were gonna be able to experience. And there's this area in your brain that keeps you safe. It's called the amygdala, and you, uh, uh, every animal really has an amygdala. And you can kind of remember it as Amy. And what we're gonna do together is help you learn how to tame Amy because when Amy's all activated too much, people have a tendency and you have a tendency, uh, to feel more anxious. So, our task together is to help you tame Amy. 

00:45:35
DAPHNE So, you mean Amy kind of, she's kind of out of control when she shouldn't be? Or she's, she was sort of designed to, for fight or flight or something (crosstalk) but now she's... 

00:45:45
JOHN ARDEN (crosstalk)Exactly, very good. Yeah, and, in fact, Amy is the commander of the fight or flight, uh, mechanism, so to speak. And so, it's kept our, our species alive. And, unfortunately, when people with, uh, anxiety disorders, whether it be panic or PTSD or whatever, Amy gets too hyperactive. And the other area of the brain that's more the advance from an evolutionary point of view, the prefrontal cortex, its job is to, it's like the executive brain. Its job is to tame Amy, but unfortunately, with, uh, folks with anxiety disorders, uh, Amy hijacks the prefrontal cortex. And we wanna shift the whole process here a little bit. Does that make sense? 

00:46:30
DAPHNE It does and it sounds like instead of reacting to a tiger on the loose, Amy reacts to, uh, a crowd full of people or something like that. 

00:46:40
JOHN ARDEN Yeah, and in fact, you even said that initially, uh, you took on this new job about a year ago. And it was a, a new challenge and it felt kind of tense and a little stressful as often is the case with a lot of people that take on a new challenge.\ Uh, but then you started to kind of back up a little bit, and you started to avoid things that made you anxious. Am I right about that? 

00:47:05
DAPHNE You're right. You're right. 

00:47:10
JOHN ARDEN Yeah. And you know what happens with Amy when you avoid things is Amy gets to love that. I mean, Amy get a little bit more jacked up and everything. And, if you shift to the right prefrontal cortex by avoiding what makes you anxious, now Amy gets to run the show. And we wanna put Amy in it's, at it's place. 

00:47:30
DAPHNE So, you're saying it's kind of like jumping in the water when you're afraid of water just instead of, uh, like doing the thing you actually, um, lower the anxiety. 

00:47:45
JOHN ARDEN Right. But, with you we're not gonna have you get up to the high dive and do a nice, big swan dive, and dive in when you don't know how to swim or you don't feel like you know how to swim. We're gonna incrementally work towards you developing a comfort, but initially it's going to be uncomfortable. And, in fact, it's gonna be uncomfortable all along, but after a while, your prefrontal cortex is, is gonna be saying, 'hey, you know, I think I can do this. It's okay. Hey this bridge isn't that bad. I've been across this bridge hundreds of times a year ago. What's the big deal now?' But, again, we're not gonna have you, you know, uh, jog across the middle lane. We're, we don't wanna flood you with too much. 

00:48:30
DAPHNE I see. 

00:48:30
JOHN ARDEN But, we want to rewire your brain and to rewire your brain, we need to have you do some things to develop a new habit. And in this case, it's a habit that you had before meaning, you were comfortable before. And, in fact, you got the promotion. 

00:48:50
DAPHNE Right. 

00:48:50
JOHN ARDEN Because people thought you were capable of the job. Right? 

00:48:55
DAPHNE Right. 

00:48:55
JOHN ARDEN You showed them, in fact, that you were capable of the challenge. And now, somehow, you've gotten to feel that you're not really capable. You can get back there again. 

00:49:10
DAPHNE Wow. That's great to hear. 

00:49:15
JOHN ARDEN So, let's, let's talk about ways that you are now, uh, avoiding uh, some of the things that, uh, you were not avoiding before. And how we might want to flip that. 

00:49:25
DAPHNE Okay. Um, well, I guess I tend to avoid, um, you know, well, a lot of people try to avoid their boss. But, you know, if I, I try to avoid getting into situations were, um, I, I kind of have to say, run a meeting or if I, you know, if I can avoid it, I'll have someone else run the meeting or I'll just avoid the meeting altogether cuz, you know, it's, people get together and there's conflict. And, now that I'm in this position, I'm the one that's expected to resolve everything and I just don't want to look like I'm, um, like you said, not competent or sort of not up to the task. So, I'd rather just not do it. 

00:50:15
JOHN ARDEN Mm. So, when you initially avoid the meeting you feel a little bit better? Uh, but then afterward you don't feel so good that you avoided the meeting. 

00:50:30
DAPHNE Well, coz I think, you know, eventually they'll find out that I'm not having meetings and, and, you know, then I will look incompetent because I'm supposed to be able to take charge in these things. 

00:50:40
JOHN ARDEN Hmm. I'm wondering if it, if there's a way for you to break up the meetings, so to speak and, and have smaller incremental meetings to work with your staff. Uh, so that it's not like a big, grand meeting. 

00:50:55
DAPHNE Put it in the conference room. 

00:50:55
JOHN ARDEN Right. 

00:50:55
DAPHNE Well, I guess I could, you know, uh, I kind of do this anyway, sometimes have two or three people come to my office and talk over instead of having the whole team. And, um, sometimes I'll, you know, stop by someone's office and, and then call someone else in, and I, I guess that's, that's a way I could, I could try to, try to break things up. 

00:51:20
JOHN ARDEN You know, there's, there's, uh, something about memory systems that I wanna, uh, uh, clue you into. Amy kind of is part of what we call the implicit memory system. It's kind of like all about feelings. And, uh, if you can get Amy to work with the other memory system, the one that you can kind of remember and go "oh yeah, I remember this. I remember that," is for, for whatever it's worth is called the declarative memory system. And, if you can get your feeling memory, Amy's driver, uh, to work with the other one. So, let's say, for example, it sounds like you feel more comfortable in your office. 

00:52:00
DAPHNE Right. 

00:52:00
JOHN ARDEN And, but you don't feel comfortable, uh, necessarily in the... 

00:52:05
DAPHNE Conference room. 

00:52:05
JOHN ARDEN Conference room. But, we're talking about smaller groups of people. I wonder if you can start with those smaller groups of people in the conference room because we want to build in your implicit memory, your feeling memory, with those people so that now you're meeting in that room, you're developing kind of a sense of competency, uh, regaining that sense of competency in that conference room. And then, you can add in other people as you go and pretty soon, you, you're orchestrating a, the big meeting like you know that you were going to be capable of, but somehow you developed this bad habit, we can call it a bad feeling and thinking habit, that you don't think you're capable of. 

00:52:50
DAPHNE And we actually have, um, smaller conference rooms for smaller meetings. So, I could, if it's okay, I could start there. 

00:53:00
JOHN ARDEN If, if that is, uh, uh, both uncomfortable, but the way to start, sure, that sounds good. But, at some point, we want, wanna get you in the conference room that you're gonna be functioning in. So, uh, I would like to recommend you go into, have the meetings in the bigger conference room because then you're building up a feeling of, uh, should we say comfort, in the room that you feel uncomfortable in because you're having smaller meetings in there. And you're, you're actually doing what you're gonna be doing in the larger one. So, basically, what we're doing is we're having more control of Amy by your prefrontal cortex, but really more your left because now you're doing and you're on specific task because what we know is that the left prefrontal cortex is all about doing specific things, and it's doing. Right is kind of step back and "oh my god, ah I'm gonna avoid," and all that. So, by you going in there and directing a small meeting, you're kind of developing the capability of taming Amy. 

00:54:15
DAPHNE Oh, I see. Now, I'm starting to see what you mean. And I'm sure I can do that because if it's only three people, it's three people, whether it's in my office or...So that it's... I already feel more comfortable. 

00:54:30
JOHN ARDEN Okay. Well, then let's add in a fourth. 

00:54:30
DAPHNE Oh, okay. 

00:54:35
JOHN ARDEN You see what I'm doing? If we can add in a little discomfort because, you know what? You know, when you say what's rewiring the brain and, and all that, um and it's all built on this whole concept of neuroplasticity, that more neuroplasticity takes place in what we would call a moderate degree of activation or moderate degree of anxiety. So, when you say that, "you know, I still feel a little anxious about that," we wanna use that as an opportunity. We don't wanna wait until you feel totally comfortable coz chances are you're not gonna get there. So, you have to get out of your comfort zone. And then, if you really want to know the details, I can explain the specific neurotransmitters that need to have a moderate degree of activation, but we can go there later if you want. But, we wanna, let's say, add in the fourth because that kind of makes you go, "I don't know, for three it's okay, but a fourth?" But, it's still within the tolerable, but still making you feel somewhat uncomfortable. Does that make any sense? 

00:55:35
DAPHNE It does and so it sounds like a long, uh, long journey of, you know, being uncomfortable most of the time. 

00:55:45
JOHN ARDEN But, after awhile, you're gonna feel a sense of mastery that you're gonna be building over a period of time and pretty soon, you're gonna be in the conference room with a whole bunch of people, and you're gonna be directing, you know, the, uh, the meeting. 

00:56:00
DAPHNE The company meeting. 

00:56:00
JOHN ARDEN Yeah. And, and people might be in conflict and all that, and you'r the mediator instead of the target. Somehow, you got in, involved in thinking that you're the target and oh my god, they're thinking of me as incapable of running this meeting. 

00:56:15
DAPHNE Right. Right. Well, it sounds like a long, long, uh, process. 

00:56:20
JOHN ARDEN Uh, a process that we can work together and maybe it's not as long as you might think, but it's certainly not gonna happen like flipping on the light switch. 

00:56:30
DAPHNE No, no, I can see that. 

00:56:30
JOHN ARDEN Yeah, yeah. So, how have you been doing over the last week? 

00:56:35
DAPHNE Well, um, I, you know, took your, you know, suggestions. And so, I've cut way back on the wine at night. 

00:56:45
JOHN ARDEN Oh, good. 

00:56:45
DAPHNE And, um, I'm not just grabbing coffee in the morning. I'm having, still don't really feel like eating so, but I'm having a little bit of, um, instant oatmeal or something like that that's quick. And, and, um, so, um, and then, you know, for lunch I'll have, instead of having, um, Starbucks, I've been having, you know, a salad or, or something light like that. 

00:57:10
JOHN ARDEN Mm-hmm. Very good. Have you been feeling any improvement related to that? 

00:57:20
DAPHNE Well, um, a little, a little, but I still, you know, I still feel, you know, just not a lot of confidence around my work, work situation. 

00:57:30
JOHN ARDEN So, we wanted to build a good foundation and I really applaud you. Fantastic. Big change. I can't tell you how many clients take quite a while to change those bad habits, but we really want to have a good foundation to build upon. And, one other thing that I, I want to recommend, uh, that is gonna give you a sense of relaxation is a little bit of an aerobic boost. And, you know, you don't have to put on a fancy leotard and jump around in the gym and all that. A brisk walk... 

00:58:00
DAPHNE Mm-hm. 

00:58:05
JOHN ARDEN Will give you that. And, if you can make brisk walk 30 minutes or you could chop it up in 10 minute little blips, uh, then you'll get actually, a neurochemical calming sensation. So, remember when you drank the wine, for example, and you felt a heck of a lot better, you know, that was sort of, uh, uh, for your reference, to kind of, it nulls our the glutamate which is just activating neurotransmitter and makes the gaba network kind of, uh, activated which mellows you out. And, but it's only short lived. And, what exercise does, aerobic exercise, walking fast and just getting your heart beat pumping will give you the same effect, but will give you a lot longer lasting one. And, if you do that in the evening, you burn off the excess stress chemicals and you get that wonderful gaba effect and your sleep will improve. Now, my guess is, I'll be going on a limb here, my guess is by not drinking the wine, you're sleeping a little bit better. Are you or? 

00:59:15
DAPHNE Well, I mean, I s-, you know, a little. 

00:59:15
JOHN ARDEN A little, okay. By doing this either after dinner or right when you get home, doing that nice walk, your sleep will even improve further, and wha-, remember we were talking about sleep hygiene techniques? You know, keeping your, your bedroom cool and, and all those sorts of things. No computer use late at night so you're not looking at light. All those things combined will help, help you sleep. 

00:59:45
DAPHNE That, that sounds really good Doctor A. I understand what you're saying and, you know, putting these things into practice, but in the meantime, I still get really anxious. And what do I do about that? 

00:59:55
JOHN ARDEN You know, you can think of the, the, your feelings as sort of a like the end of caterpillar. They're gonna change, only they're gonna change over a period of time. They don't snap back and all of a sudden "bing, I'm back," but rather, they're gonna gradually change over time. It's the head of the caterpillar that knows where it's going. It's dragging the end of the caterpillar in that direction. So, we could say the head of the caterpillar is your prefrontal cortex. And, the amygdala, Amy, is kind of like the end of the caterpillar, your feelings. So, while you're, you're, uh, challenging yourself and you're going to be, uh, doing things that are a little bit, uh, uncomfortable, uh, you can tell Amy, so to speak, "Amy, it's okay, don't worry, we're gonna get through this," because you kind of have to have this talk down as well as feel the bottom up, kind of, feeling there. So, you're gonna be working with both of them together. And so you're prefrontal cortex and your amygdala are gonna work together. But really, we've gotta get Amy back to being a useful Amy instead of one that's got the fire alarm on all the time. 

01:01:10
DAPHNE All right, I, uh, right. Well, it sounds complicated, but I guess I can give it a try. 

01:01:20
JOHN ARDEN Wonderful. Wonderful. Brain based therapy is an inclusive effort to incorporate all the different dynamics of what is going on with a person rather than spending all our time cognitive constructs or emotional or exposure paradigms. It is an attempt to incorporate all these without the theoretical clubhouse compartmentalizations. And it is somewhat psychoeducational. It's a way of providing some hope and understanding for what that person is experiencing.
