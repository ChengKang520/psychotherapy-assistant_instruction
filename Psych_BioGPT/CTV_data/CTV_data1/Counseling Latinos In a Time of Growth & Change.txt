Counseling with Latino(a)s in a Time of Growth and Change Patricia Arredondo, Ed.D. Arizona State University 

00:00:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Buenas tardes. I'm Patricia Arredondo and I'd like to welcome you to this lecture on counseling with Latinos and Latino families. It's probably pretty evident to you through the media in particular ah, some of the new shows on television ah, advertisement that will feature what appear to be Latino or Hispanic people, that there's indeed increased attention to the to the Latino population in the United States. And in the counseling profession, this is one of the fastest growing client groups, whether you're in Phoenix, Arizona, ah, Newark, New Jersey, Miami, Florida, or even areas where we least expect the Latinos to be, outside of Atlanta, Georgia, in East Nebraska, the presence of Latinos is being noted on a day-to-day basis. For counselors then, that introduces many opportunities, as well as challenges. So, with that in mind, the purpose of our lecture today is to provide an overview of areas to enhance culture, cultural competencies specific to working with Latinos and Latino families. The second objective is to look at the multicultural competencies as the model that will help to guide our discussion. And, in that competency model, as you, many of you are familiar with, we have awareness, knowledge and skills. So, we are going to be looking at some questions that help us to address our own awareness about our understanding of Latinos, and again, how we might feel about working with Latinos, and where some of those assumptions and/or feelings may come from. We're also going to talk about current and projected demographic trends. This fits under the knowledge piece in the competency's domain. Another area that looks more at culture specific information is the Latino world view models. And, we're gonna be talking about values and beliefs, how those influence family and traditions, gender role socialization. We will also look at the role of religion and spirituality and how that plays into the cultural beliefs, as well as, practices. One of the, ah, notable factors in the United States today is the immigration pattern of Latinos, and we seem to have the largest contribution of new folks into the United States, and that is, as a result of immigration. So, we will be talking about acculturation, which is a process that immigrants go through as they try to move into the mainstream of the United States. Ah, this process for ah, Latino immigrants also has a variation as I'll talk about for children, for parents, for older people ah, and we'll look at that as it relates to the pre-migration specific, and the post-migration process. And, finally, we'll talk about interventions and what we might have to consider as we plan culturally competent interventions, not just at the clinical level but also at the organizational level. It's great if we have clinicians who are culturally competent, who are bilingual, who are bicultural, who truly feel passionate about working with Latinos and Latino families. However, the organizations where we work also has its paths to support that. So, we will look at some tips for organizational enhancement. Now, some of the questions people frequently ask when it comes to the Latino community is, what is the difference between Latino and Hispanic, that's usually one of the first questions. So, let me just put that aside and, and address it immediately. Hispanic is the term that was assigned to people of Spanish-speaking heritage in the United States when the government first started conducting census of Latinos. And that was on the '70s and '80s. So, prior to that, Latinos were categorized typically as white. So, on my birth certificate, it reads "white", it doesn't say Hispanic, it doesn't say Mexican-American, it simply says white. So, we recognize that, that is a government term. Now, many people feel that that label of Hispanic is, does not suit them, and so, prefer the term Latino or Latina as a little bit more self-determined. Now, if you ah, actually come down to it, most of us prefer to self-identity, ah, identify based on our national heritage. So, I might say I'm Mexican American, someone will say they're Puerto Rican, someone will say they're Dominican. So, we recognize the umbrella term Latino, and we also, in many ways do not like the term Hispanic. But, again, it's, it's more of a political ah, statement or position. Now, there's some other questions that people often ask when it comes to Latinos. For example, why is the population growing so rapidly? Who makes up the Latino population? Does the US population and census data include people from the island of Puerto Rico? Do most Latinos who speak Spanish also speak English? Are most Latino households two-parent families? Where do most Latinos live? And, what types of jobs do most Latinos have? Another question that is now becoming more of a marketing statement has to do with the buying power of Latinos. It's more an increasing observation that Latinos have great buying power, so, you will see that particularly in business pages or business magazines of how Latinos are impacting the economy of the United States. More relevant to us again are questions about the health status of Latinos, as well as, mental health syndromes or trends. And, we finally wanna look at, what are issues that Latinos introduce in counseling. Ah, are they the same kinds of issues other people who are not Latinos would introduce? Ah, and what motivates Latinos to come to counseling? I hope that in this lecture, I will be able to address a number of these questions and begin to respond to them for you because I think that it begins to provide you with more information in that middle piece of cultural competency, which is the knowledge piece.

00:07:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Also, pick up the question of ah, why the population is growing so rapidly. Here's your, some of my uhm, statements in response to that. Latinos are people of Spanish-speaking heritage. And what we know is Latinos in the United States, Central America and South America, and the Caribbean Islands are all Spanish-speaking heritage. Primarily, in, in South America, Brazil of course, is not a Spanish-speaking country. Ah, there are some islands in the Caribbean that are not Spanish-speaking. So, people there would probably not consider themselves Latinos or Hispanics. In the US, the historical roots are also based on region, where we have the largest population of Latinos in the United States of Mexican heritage here in the southwest. The second largest population being Puerto Ricans in the East Coast, New Jersey, New York. Chicago is another area where there's a large settlement of Puerto Ricans. And then, the third largest population are people of Cuban heritage. And, they again, are primarily in the southeast, down in the Florida, Miami, Tampa are, area, and then also up in the East Coast. Perhaps, the fourth largest group of Latinos in the United States today are people from the Dominican Republic, and they are primarily on the East Coast as well. What's notable about Latinos, in spite of having ah, a language that's very similar and some values that we hold in common, there are many, many distinctions across groups, as well as, within groups. And we will be talking about that. What is important to also know about Latinos is that you cannot classify us in terms of race. When it comes to looking at census ah, categorization, Latinos are not a race. In fact, Latinos are already of mixed heritage. People who are Mexican American, for example, hold indigenous roots, as well as, European roots, and we call that mestizo. People who are from the Caribbean ah, the Dominican Republic would probably be a good example, have African, European and quite often indigenous heritage. So, the term mestizo is the more appropriate term to define our multi-cultural, multi-racial background as Latinos. And of course, in the ah, South, ah, South, South America, we know that, historically, the Indian people who were conquered by the ah, conquistadores from Spain and from Portugal intermarry ah, with those European ah, conquistadores, or explorers, and so that contributed to the mestizo ah, as Manuel Ramirez said, the, there mestizaje, or the race of Mestizos in this part of the world. And then, we have to remember, too, that African slaves were brought to this part of the world from Africa and they were brought by the explorers to the Caribbean Islands to uhm, Mexico, as well as, South America. So, we, we know that slaves were ah, obviously here in the United States, but the ah, representation of African slaves is also seen historically in Spanish-speaking countries. As I've mentioned, nationality is really preferred uhm, to say that I'm Dominican, or I'm Puerto Rican. And, to that end ah, when it comes to Columbus Day, which is Decem-, ah, October 12th and many of us like to celebrate Columbus Day in the United States, in most ah, Latin American countries, Spanish-speaking countries, we call this Dia de la Raza. Dia de la Raza. And, the word "raza," it literally means race, r-a-c-e. However, when it comes to how we talk about Dia de la Raza, we're talking about it more as a day of honoring our humanity as people. Ah, we're, we're recognizing our roots as Latinos. So, on October 12th, in Spanish-speaking countries, we have Dia de la Raza. Many people also wonder about the ah, nationalism of Latinos in the United States, even if they're second or third generation and, and question why that continues. Well, some of it has to do with proximity from the United States to, for example, Mexico, Puerto Rico, even Cuba. So, for example, here in, uhm, in the United States, there are a number of holidays that would be celebrated ah, by people of Mexican heritage. We have the ah, 16th of September, which is the Independence Day of Mexico, and it's a big holiday in, in communities where there are a lot of people of Mexican heritage. The 15th of September is the Independence Day in Guatemala. So, if you have a Guatemalan community, they will also be celebrating it. At the end of June, we have a big holiday celebrated by people of Puerto Rican heritage, ah, it's the Feast of St. John. And then, in New York City, you'll see the Dominican parade in August. So, much like we have the, uhm, Columbus Day parade on the East Coast, we have the celebration of St. Patrick's Day on March 17th, which are really celebrations of nationalism, national identity. Latinos also do the same. And, this is what we call "orgullo" or pride. Latinos have a lot of orgullo, that's considered ah, one of our strengths, as we ah, re-, ah, recognize and we honor our heritage. So, the orgullo comes through in these celebrations. But I said I was going to ask, answer a few questions about ah, the population growth and where we are today. Ah, in 2002, the, excuse me, in the year 2000, the census reported that the Latino population comprise about 35 million. Well, from 2002 to 2000, ah, 2000 to 2002, we now have the Latino population in being well over 38 million. And 38 million, I have to say, are people who are documented. And we don't have a headcount on the undocumented ah, but the percentage of undocumen-, undocumented Latinos is said to be so great that the actual population of Latinos in the United States could be close to 50 million. 

00:14:30
Current Latino(a) Population Total US population 280,540,330 Hispanic or Latino (of any race) 37,872, 475 Mexican 29, 999,836 Puerto Rican 3,608,309 Cuban 1,357,744 Other Hispanic or Latino 8,906,586 http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/Profiles/Single /2002/ACS/Tabular/010/01000US1.htm 

00:14:30
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Again, we have to compare this with the total population in the United States, which is currently 280 million. So, Latinos are 37 million or 38 million of that overall number from a documented status. Within the group of, of Latinos ah, people of Mexican heritage comprise the greatest number, and that is about 25 million; ah, Puerto Ricans, about four million; people of Cuban heritage, 1.3 million; and other Hispanics or Latinos, about nine million. And the other Hispanics or Latinos are people from Central America and South America, as well. One of the things to take note of that this popu-, this ah, population in the United States of Puerto Ricans is four million from people who are on the mainland, i.e. the US mainland. This does not include the people on the island of Puerto Rico. So, keep that in mind, as well. Now, when we look at family size uhm, and the ah, reasons why the Latino population is continuing to grow, we know that Latino families have larger families than the average ah, American. The number of ah, people in Latino households tends to be about 3.52, where the other non-Hispanic households are averaging 2.48. So, Latino families continue to average three to four children. So, that multiplication is also contributing to the larger populations, so we have two things operating with respect to the growth of the Latino population, immigration and family size. So the birth rate continues to ah, prosper and contribute to this population growth. In terms of age in the, uhm, ah, of Latinos, let's start with the Latino median age in the United States. It is 25.3, where the majority of the non-Hispanics, their national median age is 35.3. So, we have a ten-year gap. So, we have a much younger population of Latinos in the United States. In terms of the older population, we have fewer Latinos in the United States that are 65 or older. That number right now is about 5.3 percent, ah, whereas, non-Hispanic whites, the percentage there is 14 percent. So, we have this larger and increasing number of white, ah, population that is over 65 and increasingly, with the baby boomers moving in that direction, and a very youthful Latino population in the United States. Specifically talking about women, about Latinas, nationally, 12 percent of the population of women are Latinas. And the median age is 29.1 versus women in general who have a median age of 36.6. The higher birth rates overall for Latinos fall between the ages of 15 to 44, so between the ages of 15 to 44 are the uhm, birth is, when the births are occurring and, women of Mexican descent have the most children. So, you have to keep those things in mind when you look at population growth in the southwest part of the United States. For example, California has the largest population of Latinos in the United States, there are ten states that are ah, considered to have the largest population of ah, in the United States, and the majority of those states are in the southwest, California, Texas, Arizona, and we have Illinois, New York, and Florida. So those are some of the states that have the largest populations of Latinos. So, from the point of view of counselor preparation, opportunities to work with Latinos, you're going to find those opportunities in these states, as well of some of the other ten states. If we look at immigration trends, and I mentioned to you that immigration is contributing to the ah, increase or the growth among the Latino population- 

00:19:10
Immigration Trends Total foreign-born population 33,048,849 Those of Latin America 17,281,472 http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/Profiles/Single s/2002/ACS/Tabular/010/01000US2.htm 

00:19:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO - uhm, the total foreign-born population in the United States, as of ah, report from the government in the year 2002, the total foreign population, uhm, was pegged at 33 million. And, of those, of that population, 17.2 million were people of Latino descent. Okay, so that is, new, include people necessarily, who have our second and third generation. So, when you, or it, it may be part of that 38 million, but we have to look at the new immigration every year, as contributing to that overall growth. Now, some other questions we might ask, "Do, do, do most Latinos who speak Spanish also speak English?" Increasingly, the answer is, yes. With second and third generation, fourth generation families in the United States, that acculturation process has occurred particularly for children. So you actually have, in many cases, a higher percentage of young people speaking English only, what we call monolingual, when it comes to English. With the new immigrants, the family will probably have more than one language being spoken at home because children learn the new language a lot faster than their parents. So we have many families who are bilingual families or in some cases where you are new immigrants you may have monolingual Spanish speakers. But it is a myth when people say that Latinos don't want to learn English, that is a myth, that is the most important thing to new immigrant families, is that their children learn English, that their childrenhave the opportunities that they did not have educationally. So, in, indeed, the transition from Spanish to English is not always easy, and therefore, bilingual education is a very important medium for that, but it's also very desirable that children learn English. Another question that's often asked, "Are most Latino households, two-parent families?" By large, the answer is, yes. Of all the families in the United States ah, African-American, Caucasian, Asian, Native American, Latino, uhm, Latino families are, or have the lowest divorce rate among all of these families. So, we have to look at that and ah, one of few minutes in terms of what contributes to the intact family and what does that also contribute to in terms of stress for family members. Another question we asked is, "Where do most Latinos live?" That's a hard question or an easy question whichever where you pose it. As I indicated before, ah, Latinos are not only in urban areas but they're in areas such as East Nebraska and Tennessee, ah, in rural areas in Southern Ohio, where we had never expected Latinos, uhm, to ah, to reside. And of course, one of the reasons that occurs ah, probably the most important reason is employment opportunities. So we have Latinos working in ah, occupations that often times do not require the greatest skills. Now, you have to bear in mind that I'm talking about a particular strata of Latino population that are more working class, who are needing to actually have a better life, and the employment in the ah, United States offers them that opportunity. So they may be working with factories, they may be working in construction, in fact, here in the southwest, you will see more Latinos working in construction and landscape, as well as, the third area would be the service industry or the hospitality industry, and that we begin to see generalized to other parts of the United States as well. Some of the reasons have to do with, uhm, the, the type of labor that uhm, Latinos bring to ah, these oppor-, these job situations and often times they're willing to work for less, they're not unionized, so there are greater ah, opportunities for an employer to hire someone at a lower wa-, wage because they are not unionized employees. As far as women, women again are also found in the work place. Ah, and there's a myth also that many Latinas do not work before they come to the United States, that they're stay-at-home moms. Well, most of the women who do come ah, and more recently are women who are also coming from low socio-economic conditions in their country, so they have had to work outside of their home, whether it's doing, uhm, ah, laundry for other people, working in a restaurant, doing something to contribute to the family's income and well-being and they continue to do that here in the United States. Of course, one of the stressors that we'll talk about in a few, in a few minutes, is the fact that families do not have the same support system here that they had in their country of origin. Now, if we look for a couple more minutes about the employment opportunities, and ah, as I said before, we have to look at Latinos in a ah, mult-, in a multiple fashion ah, we're not all alike, not only are we people of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican descent, but we are also people who have different professional identities, we are different in terms of educational background, uhm, different in terms of life experiences and quite often you'll find that, what we think we should have in common because we are let's say all of Mexican heritage, is not the case because of educational differences, ah, work experiences, and simply socio-economic status. So you cannot assume that all Latinos are alike, it may sound simplistic, but I have to remind us that when we talk about employment that obviously not everyone works in the service industry, and I'll talk a little bit more about some of the other backgrounds. For new people, new immigrants ah, or folks who've been here only second generation, and again of lower socio-economic status, and I make that a condition of what I'm saying here. Some of the mitigating factors in terms of employment are citizenship status. It's obvious that if you are undocumented, you're not going to have the same regard in the work place, and in fact often times without citizenship ah, many employees are exploited. A second mitigating factor is educational background. If you're unskilled, if you only went to sixth or eighth grade in your country of origin in Mexico or Puerto Rico, it's not going to give you the same opportunities of someone who is coming from Mexico with an Engineering degree or an undergraduate degree in Psychology. Another factor is bilingual ability. Ah, this also becomes a safety issue in the work place ah, because often times, ah, Latinos work in, in conditions that are, are not the safest especially if they're in construction and if they can't understand English or if they can't ah, read uhm, some of the rules in the work place, they may in fact be endangering themselves. Some other factors that continue to, contribute to uhm, employment opportunities, or lack thereof, are racism and sexism, and of course, previous work experiences. By and large ah, Latinos are still found in many non-professional so-, ah, occupations. Ah, we have a very small percentage that are in what we call, technical or managerial roles, far fewer than let's say African-Americans. Men, as I indicated, will probably work in construction, landscaping, food service, and women in again food service and child-care. There's a growing entrepreneurship among Latinos here in the United States, some of that has to do with what we call, in corporate America, as the glass ceiling ah, but often it, it seems as though your, your ah, your advancement is not possible if you work for someone else, so people are, this part, in this part of country we'll see many more people starting their own landscaping businesses and so forth. One of the, uhm, unfortunate conditions ah, for Latinos in the United States is that there's an over representation of Latinos living in poverty. 

00:28:25
Percentage Living in Poverty Poverty Rate and Number of Poor (in thousands): 2000-2001 Average - All race: 11.5% (32,244) - Hispanic: 21.5% (7,872) http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/poverty01/table2.pdf 

00:28:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Twenty one point five percent of Latinos live in poverty compared to 11.5 percent for non-Hispanics. And again, keep in mind that we have a, a, a large population that are children, and so we have children growing up in conditions of poverty. With respect to health care, and this is important for us in the mental health field,- 

00:28:50
Percent that are Underinsured Although Hispanics compromise 12% of the U.S. population, nearly 1 out of every 4 uninsured Americans is Hispanic People Without Health Insurance for the Entire Year (in thousands) 2001 Total: 37,438 Hispanics: 12,417 Percent: 33.2 2000 Total: 36,093 Hispanics: 11,883 Percent: 32.9 http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p60-220.pdf 

00:28:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO - uhm, I point to the ah, Surgeon General's report of the year 1999 and the year 2001. And the Surgeon General's report ah, indicated that Latinos are the most underinsured nationally. Furthermore, in terms of health care disparities, we have the greatest risk for tuberculosis, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. We are underrepresented when it comes to cases of HIV and AIDS, although it is known that there is ah, ah, ah, a population of ah, both young women and men who have AIDS and HIV, but due to cultural sanctions, these ah, incidence go unreported. At the same time, one of the more interesting findings in this ah, Surgeon General's report that are, is that immigrants or first generation people are healthier than second and third generation. Now, why is that the case? One of the things, ah, one of the premises about this is that immigrants or first generation people continue to maintain their, their original diet. They really seek the food products that they're most familiar with, and if they are living in a community where there are people of Latino heritage, they more readily find the foods that they want and that contributes to their stable diet. Now, for second and third generation, part of acculturation means beginning to eat at fast food restaurants. So we have the diet being affected, and that diet begins to contribute to patterns of obesity, ah, high blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes. So, it is important to look at the, with children in particular, some of the eating patterns for children. Ah, coincidentally, a researcher shared with me that, for many families ah, they would like to eat healthy, but on the other hand, having the resources to take their children and eat at McDonald's, is actually also a statement that you can afford to do it, that it's, it's a little bit of a status matter. And so they want to fit in and McDonald's is part of, of the American panorama. So by eating at McDonald's you, you, in fact, are stating that you, you have not only the resources but you are being part of the American landscape. Some of the barriers to health and mental health care in the United States for Latinos are the following, as I've mentioned, insurance. We are the most underinsured in the United States. Location, uhm, location and access to ah, hospitals, access to health centers, mental health centers or services I provided. Another barrier to health and mental health care is the lack of cultural competence. It's one thing for someone to speak the language and be bilingual or to say they have interpreters or translators, but cultural competence is not the same as being bilingual. Cultural competence means recognizing ah, the health care practices, recognizing some of the taboos when it comes to administering health care to women versus men. For example, with gender ah, a man seeing a woman doctor may not be acceptable, ah, because that's just not how someone was raised. At the same time, a woman seeing a male doctor might also raise some issues around, uhm, the, the whole idea of women being pure, women not really allowing themselves to be exposed to strangers or strange men. Another barrier to health and health care ah, of course, are language differences. Ah, we cannot assume that everyone is, speaks Spanish with the same vocabulary, and from one part of the country to the other, we might find terminology that is rarely understood or not understood. So there are terms here that are used by people of Mexican heritage that would differ for people who are Puerto Rican, Puerto Rican heritage and so forth. The other thing with language differences is we have to look at what is written, and often times people say they send home ah, messages to the parents and that the messages are sent in Spanish. Here again, we have to look at the type of Spanish that's being used. We've modified ah, our English language so that it has, is at a lower reading level so parents who are not as, uhm, sophisticated with some vocabulary can actually be reached. And we need to do the same in Spanish, and I don't mean water it down or, you know, uhm, use only ah, two words in a sentence, but we have to look at the terminology that will be most relevant and a translation often doesn't do that. You know, you can't always use a term and expect that, because it says it's, it's the same thing ah, from Spanish to English that we're going to really reach the parent that we're going to reach the client. Another barrier to health care is money, dinero. And money really is a factor. Ah, so consequently, if you cannot have, uhm, health care insurance where you work, uhm, and your child becomes ill, you may find that ah, you have to really, uhm, not be able to get to the uhm, hospital or to a doctor. Most people, most Latinos do not have primary care physicians, so we see the use of the emergency room as most prevalent. So some of the gaps in, uhm, in health and mental health care are really often are result of stress. And we're gonna talk about the stress and how that contributes to ah, depression, anxiety, hypertension for Latinos. I like to talk of, a little bit about what we call acculturated stress, and this is a, a term that comes up particularly when we're talking about immigrants, uhm, and some of the factors and considerations to ah, keep in mind if you are a clinician, ah, or if you are part of an organization that is serving primarily Latinos. Terms of migration, I break it out into three phases of migration: pre-migration, migration specific and post-migration processes, and this is where most of us will work with Latino clients ah, and families is at the post-migration phase. Let's think about the pre-migration for a minute. In this period of time, people are beginning to anticipate leaving their homeland to come to the United States. And that of course, is motivated typically today for, by economic reasons. If people are in a, uhm, situation where there is religious persecution, if there is a civil war going on, that may also be a reason to migrate or contribute to that decision to migrate. And so safety reasons, ah, life-threatening reasons, at times national, natural disaster ah, will contribute to people's decision to leave their homeland. It's important to keep in mind that the prim-, the decision to migrate is not made by children. So oftenchildren are the unwilling, uhm, new immigrants and that may later on, when you see families in the post-migration stage or the post migration ah, period of time, may be one of the reasons why there is conflict in the family. So, pre-migration is all the planning, at times ah, for undocumented ah, immigrants, that planning may be really ah, of how to get into the country in a way that will get them here alive. And if you live in this part of the country, or if you leave in the uhm, Miami, Florida area where people from Haiti, people from, from Cuba, have tried to, ah, come in to the United States ah, by, via boats that are really not ah, very safe. We find that many people do not make the voyage ah, to the United States, so there's great risk at stake. And I think, we lso have to consider that those people who decide to leave, uhm, really have some kind of, of uhm, not only goal in mind, I mean, these are goal-oriented individuals, so we have to congratulate them for that, but they have to have some sort of internal courage to do that. So rather than looking at them in a pejorative way, which I think often happens, especially for undocumented immigrants, we have to look at the particular strength and courage that it takes for someone to make this decision. The migration specific era is another time we have to look at, because in this period, there are ah, not everyone has a smoothest trip from the homeland into the United States. As I indicated with undocumented people, often times they have to go through life-threatening situations in order to arrive here. Even people who have, of sent for their families, the trip here may not be on a plane, it might be on a bus, it may be many days, uhm, so we're finding that migration specific, uhm, the migration specific voyage can be wrought with a lot of anxiety and a lot of fear. There's a very, very, uhm, ah, important movie that came out about ten or twelve years ago, it's called, El Norte, El Norte or The North. And it's a, a, a movie about two children who left Guatemala together, and they left because their whole village was massacred and their parents were killed, family members, other family members were killed, and they escaped by following along with some other adults and finally coming into the United States in California. But, what was ah, traumatic, ah, watching the movie was very traumatic because what we see, we saw what two young children had to endure in order to get to safety, and some of the exploitation they also experienced along the way. So, it is in the post-migration period where we see the consequences, not only of pre-migration and migration specific, but also uhm, events and incidents that begin to affect people here in the United States. Let me talk a few minutes about some of the uhm, emotional components of. So, it is in the post-migration period where we see the consequences, not only of pre-migration and migration specific, but also, uhm, events and incidents that begin to affect people here in the United States. Let me talk a few minutes about some of the, uhm, emotional components of, of migration and immigration. The first is what I, ah, I describe as a loss and grief process. Immigration introduces a process of loss in transition, major change in your life, and depending on your social support system here, your economic resources ah, that may be a, a, a greater or more profound sense of loss and grief. So, there is a psychological effect. We can always expect that there is going to be some psychological effect from immigration. Other contributing factors to this sense of loss and grief are dislocation and isolation. You're dislocated from your homeland, what's familiar ah, often times, people find themselves in, in isolation, that is, because they don't have familiar family or friends around them. There are many men who come on their own as single men uhm, from Spanish speaking countries and that isolation is very, very hard on them, especially again, if, if they're not coming with any family and they're coming alone. Another stressor, psychological, as well as practical stressor is the economics. Ah, you clearly can't get the best job around ah, if you don't have ah, professional skills, and even if you don't, you might not have the certification that is acceptable immediately in this country to work as a teacher, to work as a clinician, a social worker, an engineer, so that lack of credential can contribute to, ah, some economic dislocation. And then what we call a loss of role, a loss of role status. So, if you were an engineer in, in ah, Guatemala, and you come to the United States, you can't necessarily immediately step into an occupation of an engineer here of whether it's for language reasons, or you have to take a a board to certify you here in this country. All of those begin to affect role status for the individual self-esteem for the individual and obviously have implications in the family. We have language and cultural dissonance that occur. Ah, and the cultural dissonance, you just think about it when you've gone on vacation somewhere, you've gone to another country, uhm, you immediately begin to feel the language and cultural dissonance. And if the language spoken there is not a language that's familiar to you, you are going to feel a little bit out of place or out of touch. If the environment looks very different from the environment from which you came, the smells, the air, ah, the weather, all of that will also begin to create a sense of dissonance and imbalance. To me, these are very normal. And I think as clinicians, we have to not pathologize this response to the cultural change but to look at it as a normal part of the process. Another contributing factor to psychological stress is gender status imbalance, gender status imbalance. Here in the United States, we believe in the egalitarian ah, ideology that, you know, all women and men have the, you know, same rights and opportunities. Ah, while in theory that's good, we know that doesn't play out. Uhm, but the socialization of Latino men and women is very much based on their ah, traditional roles that I'll talk about in a minute, and that begins to ah, have an effect here in the United States, where the expectation is that, for economic reasons, women have to go out to work. But quite often, because of women's social nature, women in general, we have a much more social nature, ah, we may pick up the language faster, begin to develop friends, ah, and that can create uhm, some dissonance in a family where the partner would be, ah, is more traditional ah, and prefers that his wife still continue to come home and, and, and make the meals and take care of the children. So, that's another ah, issue of loss. One of the things we, we need to look at in this, uhm, loss and grief process is that for most immigrants, uhm, there is a certain idealism that they come, that they come with. And that idealism is about, as I said earlier ah, greater opportunities economically ah, educationally for children. But sometimes, after a period of time, ah, you don't get the ah, kind, you're not earning the kind of money that you had hoped to, ah, you're not perhaps getting the jobs that you were told were abundant here, ah, and that sets in a process of, of, of real confusion and sadness, disillusionment, and that may contribute to later on what we, we look at as depression. So it's important to look at this loss and grief process as having different stages from the ah, euphoria, ah, the idealism, ah, the high expectations. To them it, beginning to experience some confusion, some sadness, perhaps even guilt because you left family members behind and you're really not sending back the money that you said you were going to send back. Ah, guilt and shame, ah, shame is ah, again a very strong force. And then anger, you could be angry with yourself if in a family that anger may be turned towards ah, different members of the family because you're really not realizing you're dreams here. So, we have to understand the whole context uhm, that accompanies the immigrant's experience and what the, ah, and why, to help us understand why some of the presenting issues may be ah, what they are here in the United States. I think there are two other factors that conti-, ah, contribute to acculturative stress, and they are ah, at the institutional and societal level. Once a Latino is here ah, from another country, or even Latinos here in the United States, we have what is attributed to us as minority status. And the minority status, for Latinos who come from dominant cultures where, where everyone is Guatemalan, everyone speaks Spanish in ah, in Venezuela or in Colombia, now all of a sudden they're classified as minority. Ah, that has a bit of a, ah, a, a kind of we say in Spanish, muchoke(ph), a little bit of a shock to you because it's a, it's, it's, it sounds abrasive and it's not, there's not a positive connotation to it. So, when we hear that minority status attributed to us, we may wanna resist that or again become angry with it. So the institutional and societal oppression come from this, uhm, labeling of minority status, as well as, what I said before, racism in society. And what we know, in terms of Latino's as well as other groups, that color matters. And phenotype is ah, a very apparent among Latinos. We are trigenos we are dark, very dark and maybe more indigenous. Ah, we might look more mestizo, where we have more Indian features, uhm, uhm, or again we may be what is called morueros(ph), which are people that look more white and European. So, we span the color ah, spectrum, and that again can lead to experiences within the same family of, of discrimination, ah, experiences of racism ah, from society towards the family. I'd like to talk for a few minutes about Latino values and beliefs. And ah, often times, uhm, there are of stereotypes about Latinos that uhm, that I think ah, do not also account for the generational differences and how Latinos uhm, as a large macro-culture continue to evolve over time, where acculturation continues to occur within families. But if we look at the uhm, the, the values that are most important to Latinos, ah, the first thing would be family, la familia, is probably the primary value for Latinos. In terms of relationships, Latinos, it is said value relationships highly. Uhm, at the same time, we're very hier-, hierarchical and ah, so we have this status in the family that is very well defined. We ah, tend to respect authority ah, a lot more. And that, you know, if you look at it historically, you can think about it in terms of the ah, conquering and the colonization that's occurred in all of our countries, and how that colonization really contributed to this hierarchical ah, relationship uhm, and authority orientation. However, we, the values of allocentrism, interdependence, and formal relationships pervade ah, for Latinos. So, this family centeredness means the family comes first, so you do things for the good of the whole. Within families, we have what are called kinship systems. Ah, and those kinship systems involve compadres, comadres, people who are godparents and sometimes they're not really godparents, uhm, they may just be a great family and friends. So, we look at this kinship system to involve people who are part of our life when they perhaps, our godparents at baptism, at a communion, at confirmation, or at marriage, so we have this extended family of compadres and comadres. So if you do a genogram with a, with a client or a family, you really want to understand, not just who, who's part of that nuclear family in the genogram but we, you would like to really have it spread out and have all of the family members from both sides of the family ah, become part of that genogram. And then you, you can also ask, "Do you have comadres and compadres?" and then you might see how they fit into your genogram. The, uhm, the other part of, of uhm, the model that we like to talk about with uhm, with Latino families and culture is uhm, the, the piece of religion. And, uhm, as we know this part of the, the world as I indicated earlier was colonized and conquered, ah, by people from Europe, primarily from Spain and Portugal. And in their voyage to the United States to this part of the world, what's now the United States, but to this western ah, part of, the part of the western hemisphere, ah, the ah, conquerors were also accompanied by priests. And, and the mission of those priests at the time was to ah, you know, provide a, a sense of spirituality for the explorers, but one of their key roles here, once they were in this part of the world, was also to convert the native people. So those conversions, uhm, with the mestizos, the Indian people who were, who were here, uhm, oftentimes ah, took on a very harsh uhm, effect insomuch that many people were killed for not giving up their, their own beliefs and their own faith. On the other hand, it is said that the conversion of the uhm, indigenous people to Catholicism was made much easier because there was a lot of symbolism in, in the, uhm, Indian ah, religious practices that was parallel to that of the ah, Catholic faith. And so, we have a, a, a strong spiritual and religious orientation among Latinos historically. Ah, and the Catholic religion is still uhm, the most ah, practiced by Latinos. We have seen that change, uhm, in the United States and, and also there are missionaries that continue to go to, uhm, Spanish-speaking countries who are not Catholic missionaries so, we do see ah, some individuals who are, are not Catholic. But if among the older family members ah, we still see a lot of reli-, religiosity. Uhm, here on my left is a candle, and this candle is ah, has the image of La Virgen de Guadalupe on it. And if you are of Mexican heritage and religious as well, you probably know La Virgen de Guadalupe very, very well. Uhm, many people, uhm, build altars in their homes. And these altars have these religious candles and what they have more than the candles they may have the statues, as well as, flowers. So, it's a way of praying everyday, ah, honoring your own faith and praying to La Virgen ah, for support and perhaps special favors. So, there are also ah, saints that are prayed to, and often times, it's a source of comfort. So, if you happen to be working with a client, uhm, who has a lot of stress, you may ask them ah, what they do when they are under distress and if you just have a suspicion that maybe they ah, are religious in orientation, you can ask them if they pray, and if so, to whom do they pray, because not everyone will pray to the, pray to the, pray to the Virgin Mary. As I say, she primarily is recognized in, in Mexico, but, but there are other saints as well. Gender role socialization is a very. Gender role socialization is a very important knowledge piece for counselors to know about in order to be culturally competent. Two of the key terms for gender role socialization are machismo and marianismo. Machismo is a term you've probably heard. In the positive description of ma-, ah, machismo, we have a man living up to the role of being the provider, the provider for the family because that is still the expectation. We have the other end of the continuum for machismo, which is really being a man who dominates women, who tends to be violent, who acts out uhm, an abuser. And unfortunately, that's the association that is most commonly communicated about Latino men, that they're all macho, but in the extreme end. So, as clinicians, we have to know that men may grow up with both messages but the valued message is of being a provider. The other side of the coin is marianismo, a term that refers to living up to the image of the Virgin Mary, which for all women would be hard. But, that has an expectation of purity, of passivity unfortunately, of nurturance, and being very caring and concerned about others. Mat-, ah, marianismo is a very ah, tough standard, particularly for younger women, because some of the messages that we are, ah, what we learn ah, as Latinas, are,-

Ten Commandments of Marianismo Latina Norms for Female Socialization Do not forget a woman's place. Do not forsake tradition. Do not be sigle, self supporting or independent-minded. Do not put your own needs first. Do not wish for more in life than being a housewife. Do not forget that sex is for making babies-not for pleasure. Do not be unhappy with your man or criticize him for infidelity, gambling, verbal and physical abuse, alcohol or drug abuse. Do not ask for help. Do not discuss personal problems outside the home. Do not change those which make you unhappy that you can realistically change. The Maria Paradox (Gil & Vasquez 1996) 

00:57:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO - are such messages as do not forget a woman's place, do not forsake tradition, do not be single, self-supporting or independent-minded, do not put your needs first, do not ask for help. Ah, so, if we grow up with these particular messages and we encounter a situation where we, in fact, want to move away from a tradition, where we don't wanna go home and live even though we're single, that can create conflict with a daughter and her parents. As well, uhm, the idea of not discussing personal problems outside of the home may introduce in counseling, another barrier. Ah, someone may go for the first time but find that this message about asking for help and discussing problems outside as(ph) a(ph) home, is very ah, much not the norm that they learned. And, in fact, they may begin to feel some verguenza, some shame for having gone to talk about problems outside the home to a stranger. So, these are some of the factors that may impede, uhm, individuals from seeking help. Now, what are some of the more common value conflicts that you may hear about in counseling and just need to recognize these ah, as pretty typical for families in general, but with Latinos, what we may find is that women develop more friendships outside of the home and that may create an imbalance within the family, ah, between the, the, the wife and the ah, husband. Parents may differ on raising their children that can create some conflict. Women may earn more money than men, create some stress for the couple. Children may want to deny their heritage, stop speaking Spanish, not spend time with grandparents, that's a problem for the family. We may also have children's choice of friends not being what the parents would like, that creates conflict or children who's parents have curfew when their friends are, are, are out on the streets 'til 11 o'clock. In particular, the daughter's social behavior is very monitored in the family, and that continues to be the case ah, in the United States for Latino families. Another value conflict for the family is if the daughter or the son decides, or announces, I, let me say this way, announces their gay and lesbian identity. Ah, because there is still a very strong cultural norm about marriage, about being parents, and so, this creates some strife not only for the individual who is gay or lesbian but also for the entire family. What does this mean in terms of counseling and what do we have to take in, into consideration? Obviously, in order to be culturally competent, we have to check out our own biases and assumptions about Latinos. We have to develop this ah, repertoire of, of knowledge that will help us to provide more culturally relevant services in a particular part of the country. We talk a lot about this in our book, "Counseling Latinos and La Familia" - a very practical guide for clinicians because we really believe that there are some examples that are both culture specific but, like counseling in general with families, with children, with adolescents, with women. So "Counseling Latinos and La Familia" is a very practical guide that can supplement ah, my lecture today. So we want to develop treatments and approaches that suit the presenting issue. Never go out of your way to try to ah, apply an approach just because a person is Latino. Look at the presenting issue first and try to understand what is going on for the individual, for the family. They bring their hat-, heritage with them just like everyone else does, but they come for a presenting issue. So we want to make sure that our intervention is relevant. You're goinna have a different intervention for someone who comes in with anxiety versus someone who's mandated by the courts for ah, substance abuse versus someone else who's coming in because their childisn't going to school. So, the, the treatment must be relevant to the situation. We also must recognize the generational and acculturation status of the individual and family. That's an important factor. And our own biases about immigrants must also be evaluated. We also want to ah, consider other sources of support. Earlier, I talked about prayer. Ah, I think it's important to know ah, the holidays that people celebrate and how holidays may be part of that. Uhm, I have here a, a little skeleton, which is the ah, symbol of Dia de los Muertos in Mexico. And this is both a religious, as well as, a cultural holiday in Mexico. So it's really a way of honoring the dead, people have, who have gone before us. And, and part of that celebration is creating altars, different from the altars you have at home on a daily basis, but altars that will in fact ah, allow us to communicate with deceased family members. So, it's a very strong and positive tradition as well. I think ah, I would be remiss if I did not talk about the benefits of bilingual therapy or of allowing the, the client to speak in Spanish in therapy. Oftentimes, clinicians are not Spanish speaking or don't feel like they're fluent, but that does not mean that we should not invite the client to speak in Spanish because we know in fact that the language of emotions is our primary language. So, if you see an individual really attempting to describe or to ah, release some emotion, and you can read that non-verbally, encourage the individual to do it in Spanish and then they can tell you in English what they said. So, there is a great benefit for bilingual therapy because it really gets at the heart of very important issues. And finally, if you are in an organization that serves Latinos and Latino families, it's very important to look at the kind of relationships you have to build in that community in order to be perceived as a culturally ah, approachable organization. As I said earlier, it's not sufficient to say you, you have bilingual ah, personnel or that you have translators. It goes beyond that. It really is your whole environment, uhm, the way the place looks in terms of its ambiance and the welcoming people will get. I've called places here, uhm, to an agency and I hear someone speaking in Spanish who has a horrible accent, and I said, why can't they find someone in the community who could do it just as well in English and Spanish. So, those are the, the small matters that to me indicate whether an organization is moving towards cultural competence. So, I'd like to leave in closing with a, a few words of in-, inspiration that come from Cesar Chavez, who's considered a civil rights leader with the migrant farm workers union, and migrant farm workers and other ah, oppressed groups across the country. He, uhm, parallels uhm, in a way the era of Martin Luther King Jr.
