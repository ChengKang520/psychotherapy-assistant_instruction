BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
RON KURTZ HAKOMI This is a client uh… uh… from Germany, her name is Claudia. And this is a very good example. This session is a very good example of a whole different way of reconsolidating. Usually, we reconsolidate uh… by providing a very loving and caring and… uh… natural environment, you know, a safe caring environment for someone to grieve a little bit to… to… umm… gonna re-experience some of the old pain, so that they can, uh… feel differently about the situation, uh… how… as it is has… has changed during the process of, uh… therapy. So in this case, we're not using, uh… this kind of comforting, we're using play and fun uh… in order to uh… reconsolidate this… this painful memory. And part of that memory, part of all those painful memories is a belief, sometimes implicit, sometimes it's learned uh… procedurally. But, uh… it's always, there is always a kind of a belief system involved. If uh… if you learn somehow as a child or very young to be afraid of dogs. You gonna have the belief implicit in your behavior, even if you never think it. Uh… dogs are dangerous or dogs could bite you or stay away from dogs, you know. So we look… We want to bring those beliefs into consciousness. Why… why we are reconsolidating? So if you can start laughing and enjoying yourself and… and being comfortable with people around you while you're remembering this… these beliefs, they will change, they will change, they loose their certainty. Okay. So this… that's why this is a good example of. And it's also fairly quick session. I don't remember exactly how long it took, but 30 minutes may be. The… I… I think about these sessions now are… are… Well, there's a couple of really important things about and, you know, there's the use of assistance, there's a use of the group, and there's this, all about, when to be silent and, and uh… How quickly you can get to what, uh… you can get to a core belief and how quickly you can help the person reconsolidate it. If you just, if you just do simple things, you know, if you don't interrupt, if you don't intrude, if you don't said or… There's a lot of things you shouldn't be doing. And basically what's left is just simply caring and paying attention and offering the right kind of nourishment and support. That's all there is to it. Like you can know notice of course, is like the tears on her shirt and she's isn't crying and she's sad right now. This is Sabrina(ph) her sister, who is there to help. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:03:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Who would you like to tell me? To very strange beginning for me. I usually just wait for the client to speak but… Just popped in my head, so I did it. 

00:04:10
[sil.] 

00:04:15
CLAUDIA I don't interact, I can't exactly say why I… I'm crying but, umm… but I can't. 

00:04:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So? 

00:04:25
CLAUDIA No, it's, uh… I don't know the reason. It was all right yesterday. I was always… it was hurting a lot. 

00:04:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Here? 

00:04:30
CLAUDIA Here. Oh, and she… When Sandra had her… 

00:04:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI A session? 

00:04:35
CLAUDIA Session, I was crying all the time. I don't know why. 

00:04:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So this thing, but I don't know why comes up two or three times in this session. And it kind of suggest to me some very early stuff where, where the child couldn't explain it to herself and I think it's a very good thing. When you have some emotions and you're not rationalizing. Please tell me I, I cried, I cried yesterday, I don't know why. That's something we can really do, we can find out, we can use it, we can discover. Like what's behind this emotion and it's very… I think it's a very fruitful place to begin. 

00:05:25
CLAUDIA I mean, one topic is, I can't learn. I, I… still I can't learn, that's… I can't take it in. And the other thing is, I have always that feeling, I'm not being myself quite, I'm always trying to be what others expect of me. 

00:05:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah. Okay. I think she called those feelings, but actually they are beliefs. And… and it's gonna turn out that… that's really what's there. I can, I… I… I… She has a belief finally. She just… She will go all the way and feel it and, and get the idea much more clearly and have some conscious control over it at some point. She's gonna… she's… she has this belief that she can't be herself. 

00:06:20
CLAUDIA So my therapist said to me okay. Why do you think we go for a walk? And I'll just take over. That… that everything is okay. I really feel free, good. And I tried to imagine being with her or being anywhere. I just being myself with another person and I couldn't even imagine what this would be like. So umm… 

00:06:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You saw that movement of the hand, and the arm. As she is forming, she was saying I can't even imagine this anger, little gonna be anger there, frustration, uh… I can't even imagine being myself. 

00:07:05
CLAUDIA What I might like best in my life is being in my bed, reading a book, and not being there at all, and having nobody with me. This is when I really kind of relax and this is rather boring too, boring kind of life. And learning is to say…the learning is which is…one part of all this, bigger thing, I think. 

00:07:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI This is a very good presentation of hers. Mitchell (ph) is very real, it's emotional, it's, uh… pretty deep stuff. So uh… I… I believe it's gonna… she's gonna be a great client and of course she, she turns up to be more… 

00:07:45
CLAUDIA Learning would be get, getting in contact with the ideas of somebody else taken it, thinking about it. 

00:07:55
[sil.] 

00:08:00
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So, you, you, what you just described to me sounds like, you have a habit of shutting down when people are close and people are around. Yeah. 

00:08:10
[sil.] 

00:08:15
CLAUDIA Sometimes it's really nice with other people but afterwards, the next day, I'm completely umm… exhausted. 

00:08:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So it's not like she just shuts down exactly, she is re-correcting me slightly, that she can be with people and it's nice but then she's exhausted, which means she was using a lot of energy to be with people and we gonna look at that. 

00:08:40
CLAUDIA I'm exhausted. Although I like being… uh…, this last year I… I often like being with people and I'm more relaxed than I used to be but still I'm exhausted. 

00:08:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Uh-huh. 

00:08:55
CLAUDIA And this is… 

00:08:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So you're using a lot of energy when you're with people? 

00:08:55
CLAUDIA Yes, yes I'm using lots of energy, obviously. 

00:09:00
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Uh-hmm. Let's do this. I'm actually… Let me tell you… Let's figure out what… what you're doing with that energy and see if we can help you and see if we can be… We'll do whatever it is… You do, for you when you're with people. Okay? So you have to explore what… what… uh… what… what kind of… what motivates you, what kind of energy do you have to use to be with people. And the way… possibly the way to do that is to just close your eyes and we'll just leave you alone for a while, you get relaxed as possible and then when you're ready just open your eyes and to be with us and study how you do it. This is actually to being with exercise, were you try to get relaxed and quiet with your eyes closes. If you are not with anybody and then you, when you feel ready you open your eyes and you study exactly how you mobilized, how your body and your mind mobilize to meet this new condition, you're with somebody. It's called being with, uh… I don't know if even do this. What, what comes up in your mind and in your, in your body and then we're… what kind of energy do you mobilize with to be with people? 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI And, you know, there is a kind… there is a strange combination of things going on with her facial expression, with Claudia's facial expression, that the lips are kind of perched in, it looks like anger, there's still some sadness in the eyes and around… around the nostrils, it's mixed thing going on. 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:11:00
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Very slight nose, you just said to herself. Sadness is coming up again. 

00:11:05
[sil.] 

00:11:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You… You are getting more energized uh… Yeah. 

00:11:30
CLAUDIA Sort of. 

00:11:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Can you just… Can you be with this experience you're having and just talk a little bit to me why you're… Tell me what's going on? And, you know, there's the quality of people who are, basic… in their minds they are basically alone and, uh… when they act… when the clients… she's a good client but she's still has this habit of like not talking about her experience while it's happening and I had to prompt her to do that. 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's difficult? 

00:12:15
CLAUDIA Difficult to do. I'm just… I can't describe it. But I don't know what's going on. It's… 

00:12:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI There's that theme again, I don't know what's going on. 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:30
CLAUDIA I feel so sad and unhappy. 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I'm gonna ask you, but don't try to do anything. So… So now I'm gonna attempt to talk to her unconscious. I'm gonna ask her why she's sad and see if she will get some kind of answer. If she obviously can't get the answer herself by… by… uh…consciously trying to get the answer. So may be I can get an answer to pop up. But I don't know if her relationship's in place for that yet. Trying to answer. Just, just see what happens when I say, I… I ask you. Claudia… No violence… Why you're sad? 

00:13:20
[sil.] 

00:13:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI That was my mistake. I'm… I mistranslated the German. It's close but it's… 

00:13:30
CLAUDIA It's going away. 

00:13:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Uh-huh, okay. 

00:13:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So it… You just don't tell him, huh… it's like a part, who wants to run away from that. Don't let them see as you're there. I have to make some… Oh, that's the one, okay. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Well, if that's her automatically reaction, that's the habit about don't show your sadness. Well, we got to get pass that one. We have to make that okay before whatever understand much about it. So I'm gonna prop, I'm gonna say something like that. I want to tell you, okay? You, you can be sad with me. You can show me your sadness. It won't hurt me. Keep, you can see that, there's a tiny smile that happened and she couldn't believe as though she got sad again. And you could see her squeezing her face shut, uh… 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You know, I strongly believe in accompanying people when they are in this kind of state. Especially, if it's evoked during, during the process of therapy. And… and she's got her sister right here who could easily comfort her. We're holding… She's holding her hand, like offer her my hand. Just to make it okay. You know, to say okay I'm here, I… I understand and you're okay too, you know, what I'm saying. I've no problem with your sadness. That's… We're trying to giving this space to be sad. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI There's… there's still part that holds it into, uh… that part. Can you speak for that part, as a part that wants to hide, yeah? 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You are saying no to something, no, uh… 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:05
CLAUDIA I don't know why 

00:16:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I don't why you hide, you want to hide. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. It's just clear. It's not a good idea to really cry. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's not a good idea to cry, that's what she realizes. That's, that the part that holds all that sadness back, has a belief, it's not a good idea to cry and there's got be a history that creates that belief. So, uh… we're gonna work with that a little bit now. I'm gonna pull back a little bit ‘cause I'm too far… leaning too far. So, uh… the belief is, it's not a good idea to, to… to cry or to show them you're crying or not to show your's… 

00:17:05
CLAUDIA Not to cry at all. 

00:17:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Then don't cry. 

00:17:05
CLAUDIA No, not, not even when I'm alone. 

00:17:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Look. Okay, So that… that belief umm… is a habit uh…it's, it's a thought, habit of thought. And maybe if we take it over, maybe we'll evoke a little bit of the memory whether that… where it made sense. Were with something you wanted uh… uh… not to do because there's a part of you that's back there that still running this and we can rescue her. would that be nice? 

00:17:45
CLAUDIA Yes. 

00:17:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Okay. A little skepticism. Well, that's the logic of it uh…let's, let's go back and find this memory that created this belief system. So I need a voice and… but, you know, would you come. Yeah, I want to do it in German. Okay? Have doubts? 

00:18:15
CLAUDIA Oh, no let's do it English. 

00:18:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You want to do it in English? 

00:18:15
CLAUDIA Yes, I studied it. I, I understand pretty well. 

00:18:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's not about understanding, it's about revoking. 

00:18:25
CLAUDIA It's about… oh, yeah, okay, I see what you mean. 

00:18:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah. 

00:18:25
CLAUDIA Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:18:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI And, Claudia, what you want do is. Listen to this voice, listen to how it says it and if it doesn't sound quite right, adjust it, umm… 

00:18:35
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. 

00:18:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So that it sounds exactly like it. It acts in your mind. Okay. So this is Bettina, she's a native German speaker. And that… that's… she's a therapist and… So I want her to to be the voice because her, her German will be perfect. Well, just try once. You just listen to it very carefully. It's good. Don't cry. 

00:19:10
BETTINA Don't cry? Okay. 

00:19:15
[sil.] 

00:19:35
CLAUDIA It makes me angry. 

00:19:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Good. Good. 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Uh… so we're gonna say it again. Marshall's just gonna hold your wrist, just in case you want to get movement. No, you don't have to move if you don't want to. 

00:20:05
CLAUDIA All right. I, I would like to. 

00:20:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI But if it feels good. 

00:20:05
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. 

00:20:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So… 

00:20:10
MARSHALL You can keep… 

00:20:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So this is simple taking over the containment of the anger, so that she can feel it and express it as much as she likes in a safe way. 

00:20:20
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:20:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah. 

00:20:20
CLAUDIA Good. 

00:20:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So when you're ready, um… 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:50
[non-English narration] 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Plus. 

00:21:15
CLAUDIA Hmm… getting a headache. 

00:21:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You're getting a headache? 

00:21:15
CLAUDIA Yeah, little bit. I can't, uh… getting. Still it's like I'm getting… 

00:21:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah, it's like saying shut down, get quiet, don't move, don't do anything, shuffling that, off dodge, okay. So this is the habit. 

00:21:35
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. 

00:21:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Strong feelings come up. 

00:21:35
CLAUDIA I shut down. 

00:21:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You're shutting down, that's the whole general pattern, huh? 

00:21:40
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Okay. So we gonna talk to you about that now. We just do it softly. And, if you want to have a good, uh… emotional expression that's fine, that's totally fine, you tell us we'll, we'll create that. But I wanna look for the situation that created this habit. The habit that you have of shutting down is what we want to look at. So either you can have a great time exploding which is perfect, perfect to all. 

00:22:15
CLAUDIA I've had that, I've had that so often. 

00:22:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI We only… 

00:22:15
CLAUDIA Uh… So boring. 

00:22:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Okay, we don't do it. 

00:22:15
CLAUDIA Kind of. Umm… 

00:22:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI But only if it feels good, you got to keep that in mind. Whatever feels good, that, that's, that's when you're acting in your best interest, uh… and you're being yourself when it feels good. So we'll do this thing. We want to look for the… Oh, yeah, that's great, you're softening, huh. 

00:22:40
CLAUDIA Really? 

00:22:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah, yeah your face got soft, it was beautiful. 

00:22:45
CLAUDIA I like it. I like it when you said, if I feel good than it is myself. 

00:22:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah, Yeah. 

00:22:55
CLAUDIA Yes that, this was nice. 

00:22:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Great. See through her. So you know what we're doing, we're looking for memory because the memory will make sensitive behavior, and the memory will also tell us to, you don't need that behavior here. So let's just do this voice again. 

00:23:15
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:23:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI And you can tell me, what to say to, if it, if you know what I look, what's more evocative, but because it's with this too. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So there's several ways in which you get the, the client uh… immersed in what you're doing. You know, she… I got to tell you, she can change the voice, she can change the words, and umm… she can uh… decide to do what feels good. She can… you know, I'm engaging her participation as much as possible. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
[non-English narration] 

00:24:05
BETTINA Okay, okay ready? 

00:24:05
CLAUDIA Yeah. 

00:24:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI No worry. No more feeling, uh… go ahead. 

00:24:10
[non-English narration] 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:45
[non-English narration] 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:15
[non-English narration] 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yes, it's kind of resignation in that shy, huh? 

00:25:40
CLAUDIA I prefer it doing it myself. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:26:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI There's a way in which, Claudia doesn't seemed to uh… have the idea that she can get help, you know, she just goes inside. When it gets heavy like this, she goes inside and works on herself. This is not sharing much with us. That… that's part of the pattern. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:27:00
RON KURTZ HAKOMI And, you know, she has done that twice now. But we often take it over and she said, I rather do it myself. One of your thought. 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's amazing to me, how much time she can spend inside without communicating at all with the, the people around her. I mean, if it's the pattern but it's really extreme. And we say silent, now she gets to do that. We don't interrupt her. The important thing is to be there when she comes out. So, it's… that is disappearing and I always, you know, be there for… 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:20
CLAUDIA Well, what I feel like… It's a bit like, when I was a little girl and I was so bad tempered. I was so… 

00:28:30
BETTINA At bad mood. 

00:28:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Mm-hmm. 

00:28:35
CLAUDIA Was it bad? 

00:28:35
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So look at that. I mean, we just, I…I'm gonna time this at some point. That was probably a minute and a half of quite of silence, right? And she works insides, she works insides, she comes back with… I feel like I've… like, like I did when I was a little girl. That's… that's the memory. The memory is coming back as a feeling now. And I was always bad, I wasn't a good little girl, I was bad she says. That's the… that's the idea they gave her, you know. 

00:29:05
CLAUDIA Being a bad girl. I wasn't funny, I wasn't nice, I wasn't…good girl. 

00:29:15
BETTINA You were not happy. You were not easy going I'd see. 

00:29:20
CLAUDIA Not the happy kid. My parents would had… 

00:29:20
BETTINA Mm-Hmm. 

00:29:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I was not the happy kid and my parents would have and imagined wanted uh… 

00:29:30
BETTINA Angry? Hmm? 

00:29:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Mm-hmm. 

00:29:35
CLAUDIA Angry? Yes as well, but more like, running around all the time with… umm… 

00:29:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah, sour. You can put, put words, words, use words to that. I won't… start with I won't. 

00:29:55
CLAUDIA I'm so fed up with that. I am, I just don't like to share with you. I find it so disgusting with you. I find it hateful, here someone hateful. I can't just… 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's not quite clear… I mean, we… This is… She's to, reliving we're experiencing some of those feelings you had as a child, that's great, and that's exactly where we should go. But we haven't got an image of the situation. The only thing I have in my mind about it is, you know, I'm here to make my parents happy, uh… uh… I'm a bad girl. So I have some of those ideas or some of the words she attaches to that situation. Now I'm gonna have to work with that. 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:05
CLAUDIA I could never, can never do it right. Never, I'm never the right person. 

00:31:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You know, you can never do it right. 

00:31:15
CLAUDIA Told, always doing things wrong. I can't ever be a good person. 

00:31:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I can't ever be a good person. Somehow, there is still that belief in her. What? I don't know how that situation came about but it was damaging. 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:45
CLAUDIA And I hate it. 

00:31:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah, louder. Try it louder. I hate it. 

00:31:50
CLAUDIA I hate it. I just hate it being with you. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:15
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Can you look at me? I don't need just to be good. I don't need that you even to be happy. You can be whatever you want to be. Smile on her sisters, smile on Bettina(ph), absolute disbelief on her face. That's the missing experience, somebody accepting her for who she is. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:50
CLAUDIA I can't believe that. It's such a nice idea. 

00:32:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Look at the change that came over her, uh… It's such a nice idea. I can't believe it. It's so as funny, it's so unbelievable and then she kind of looking me, really checking out. 

00:33:15
CLAUDIA It's difficult to believe, somebody allowing me to be just… 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You study a little, okay? I don't need you to be happy. I don't need you to be good. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:40
CLAUDIA You are a liar. This is, all this therap… psychotherapy blah, blah, blah. 

00:33:50
[sil.] 

00:33:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It's bullshit, it's unreal. So there's a different mood immediately now, uh… She's laughing, she's playful, everybody around her is a little bit playful. So I'm just gonna play, umm… play with something. Is it good way to reconsolidate? You know, if you, if you do something that used to be painful and now it's very playful and fun, it reconsolidates, it changes your… uh… your experience. That you're re-experiencing it differently and that's what we're gonna do. 

00:34:30
CLAUDIA Uh… I'm there to make my parents happy, to make other people feel good. 

00:34:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI And that was the message you didn't like. 

00:34:40
CLAUDIA Yes. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Yeah. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
CLAUDIA Even now I'm feeling is it okay to laugh? Is it okay to, uh… not to accept the message. Even now I have… in, in the earlier times I had to be the perfect client. 

00:35:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI That's the…So that's the habit. 

00:35:05
CLAUDIA It is so terrible. 

00:35:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI A habit… 

00:35:10
CLAUDIA Yeah, it's really 

00:35:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So let's do this for a while. Will you play this game with me? I'll say those things you keep saying bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. 

00:35:20
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:35:20
RON KURTZ HAKOMI That sounded fun. 

00:35:20
CLAUDIA It's good. 

00:35:25

00:35:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Claudia, I, I don't need you to be happy. 

00:35:30
CLAUDIA Bullshit. 

00:35:30
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I don't need you to be good. 

00:35:35
CLAUDIA I don't believe a word you say. 

00:35:40
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I have a special little thing to do too. We have a question we could put right here about something. Just a little one. I'm… I'm just a big baby. All right now. We'll do it again but when… You watch what happens now, okay, well, go ahead. I, I don't need you to be happy. 

00:36:00
CLAUDIA I don't believe you. 

00:36:05
RON KURTZ HAKOMI I don't need you to be good. Yeah, bullshit, come on.

CLAUDIA This is fun. 

00:36:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI It should be fun. Now, does everybody here know how to fall over? 

00:36:50
CLAUDIA Yes. 

00:36:55
RON KURTZ HAKOMI We can do with the whole group now. You all gonna say, I don't need you to be good, I don't need you to be happy. She's gonna say, bullshit, and you all fall over. 

00:37:05

00:37:25
CLAUDIA Bullshit. 

00:37:30

00:38:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI How about, once more for road, you know, one more for the road. 

00:38:50

00:39:05
CLAUDIA Yeah. 

00:39:10

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:45
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Let's make a little impact, okay. Anytime we can, while we're in group together, if you like saying to Claudia, I don't need you to be happy, you say bullshit, they will fall down. 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:05
CLAUDIA This is nice. Okay. That's true. Yeah. 

00:40:10
RON KURTZ HAKOMI You got a deal?

00:40:25
RON KURTZ HAKOMI Good. And we'll come back if something comes up inside if, not, might not this might be great, you know, reinforce to happen as this much. I don't need you to be… Oh, no. But if something comes up you tell me, all right, because I'm gonna work on it. 

00:40:45
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:40:50
RON KURTZ HAKOMI So, when Claudia, she, she had this unhappiness about her when she was in class before this session for a several days I think, maybe a week even. And after this, she seem pretty happy. You know, she didn't have that look on her face anymore. Seem to be enjoying herself. And the… the feedback I got with, from her when she went home, after she went home for a while, you know, things were much different. Well, a little session like that can reconsolidate around this, very painful belief that I have… I'm here to make other people happy. Phew…
