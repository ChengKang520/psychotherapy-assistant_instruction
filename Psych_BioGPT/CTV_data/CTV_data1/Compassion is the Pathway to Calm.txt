DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember importance of daily practice in creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Current research on compassion informs us that people who have a higher degrease of compassion whether for a known loved one, a stranger or someone who can be described as a difficult person or even someone you have a conflict with, have fewer and less intense symptoms of depression and anxiety or stress than those people who have less compassion. Those with a greater sense of life satisfaction and more positive day-to-day emotions show this capacity for compassion. The university of Wisconsin, Madison concluded that not only is compassion good for you, it can be trained. So, today's practice is: Compassion is the pathway to calm. Let's practice together. One, take a moment to identify a person who you already feel positive feelings toward. Just reflect on your feelings for that person for a moment and allow yourself to enjoy a heartfelt sensation. This individual can be somebody from the past, a person who might not even be in your life anymore or somebody who you see every day. This person might even be an idealized person who you can just picture and feel the warmth toward. Let the image of the person become as clear as possible in your mind. Allow yourself to feel openhearted passion toward them, an easy feeling that allows you to know a sense of gentle warmth emanate from you through to them wherever they might be. Take a moment to identify a stranger, someone who you don't really know, maybe the bus driver. The woman who served you coffee or someone who you… you just passed in the street today. Now, remember the positive feeling that you have for a loved one. Begin to allow that feeling to resurface and apply this sensation towards a stranger. Just reflect on your feelings for that person for a moment.

DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Allow yourself to enjoy a heartfelt sensation. Let the image of this person become as clear as possible in your own mind's eye, in your imagination. Allow yourself to feel openhearted compassion toward them. An easy feeling that allows you to know the sense of gentle warmth emanating from you through to them wherever they might be now. And finally, take a moment to identify of being a person you find difficult. Now, be careful not to start with your worst enemy. Start with someone who you know and maybe have a minor disagreement with. Now, remember the positive feeling you have for the loved one and begin to allow that feeling to surface and apply this sensation toward the difficult person. Just reflect on your feelings for that individual for a moment and allow yourself to enjoy a heartfelt sensation. Let the image of this person become clear as possible in your mind. Allow yourself to feel openhearted compassion toward them. An easy feeling that allows you to know a gentle sense of warmth emanating through to them wherever they might be. The heavy lifting of this exercise is truly in directing an openhearted sense of compassion towards someone who you feel has hurt you. It takes a new frame of mind to allow yourself to feel less negative about someone, who you perceive has hurt you. This doesn't mean that you need to push yourself in the company of people who are hurtful, just that you can relieve yourself of the burden of carrying the hurt. Instead, you replace this for compassion for them and the struggles that they might have had that led them to believe to behave in the manner that they did or do. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
