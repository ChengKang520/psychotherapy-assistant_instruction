BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
JUDITH BECK It's a pleasure to talk to you about one of our favorite topics, ah, CBT approach to weight loss and maintenance. I'm Judith Beck. I'm the President of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia. We're a non-profit organization whose mission is to spread, to disseminate CBT, ah, throughout the world. Uhm, and so, I'm on the road a lot, uhm, training. We would do a lot of training at the Beck Institute as well. Not only in, uhm, the field of weight loss maintenance but really for psychiatric for many, ah, specific psychiatric disorders including depression and substance abuse, and anxiety and PTSD, and children in adolescence and bunch more. I can't think of it at the moment. Oh, schizophrenia, too. Were you at one of our workshops? Oh, well, nice to see you again, then. Ah, but today, we are gonna focus on this issue of how do we help people lose weight. But that's really not the major focus, it's to lose weight and to be able to keep it off. So, the, uhm, program that we developed, that Deborah Beck Busis is going to describe in a moment, is based on, ah, couple of, of books for consumers that Debbie helped me write, which I wanted to call how we get yourself to eat in a really healthy way for the rest of your life. Which, if you're not eating in that way already, we'll probably help you lose weight. But really the focus is on how do you get yourself to be healthy. Ah, in a few minutes, I'm going to start, ah, clinical demonstration. But first, I'm going to need some, ah, ah, volunteer to role play someone who has a weight issue. So, if you could start lining up here by the steps, then, I'm gonna find out from you what are your biggest problems. And then, uhm, I'll select the person whom I think will best help me demonstrate what some of these problems are, ah, or what, what the solutions for some of these problems are. So, I'd like to introduce Deborah Beck Busis. Ah, Debbie is a social worker, she's the diet program coordinator at the Beck Institute. And, ah, you might have noticed that her middle name and my last name are the same, that's because Debbie is my daughter. And, uhm, you might have noticed that my last name and her middle name are the same as Aaron Beck's last name, because he is my father and Debbie's grandfather. And, uhm, so proud and pleased that I have generations in either side of me to consult with all the time. Ah, so-- oh, it's nice. Thank you. I just have a couple of announcements to make. Uhm, one is, Debbie and I have to leave immediately after the session. I have another session to go to and Debbie has an airplane to catch. So, I'm sorry that we won't be able to, ah, answer questions. However, I am having a conversation hour on Saturday, uhm, where people can come and ask whatever questions you'd like including on this topic. I also wanted to mention that what I'll be doing today is a consultation session and it-- it's not the same as the sessions, uhm, that I do in my therapy office and that Debbie does full-time as, ah, as a diet coach in her office. So, mostly, I'm gonna be hearing problems and suggesting strategies, and in order for the dieter to implement the strategies, we would want her to learn certain skills that Debbie will talk about, ah, in a certain order and really master the skills. So, I underst-- so, I just like you to understand that I don't expect the, uhm, the volunteer to be able to go home and use all the things that I talk about. But I, I hope it'd just layout some strategies that I hope that he or she can learn over time. Ah, if you volunteer, I need to just make sure that you are straight weight loss, uhm, client and that you don't have psychological issues. Uhm, if people have-- no, the reason for this is, is really important. This program is not designed for people who have psychiatric disorders or who have, ah, significant psychological issues, it is designed for people with, with-- ah, who are functioning well and need help in this particular area. Because the approach that we've developed is not really psychotherapy for this population, it is really more like diet coaching using CBT techniques, and that's important to understand. Uhm, oh, also, did some of you attend our workshop a couple of days ago on this topic? So few, not, not that many. The-- we have posted slides for that workshop on the, uhm, website for this conference. But we have, uhm, very much updated those slides in the last few months. And so, if you'd like to get a copy of the slides for that workshop, and actually, I won't throw in the, the slides for the workshop I did yesterday on personality disorders. Then, I need you to provide me with your e-mail address and you can do this in three ways. One is, our volunteer, Karen, is going to send around a couple of blue pads of paper and you can write your, your e-mail address very large and legibly on that. Or, you can give, ah, Karen, uhm, ah, any piece of paper or business card with your e-mail address, and she's going to be sitting in the front row in the very last seat so you'd be able to find her. You can-- I give that to her and offering it back to Philadelphia, and we will make that, uhm, list. And, uhm, we also have, uhm, a lot-- we do a lot of social media that Debbie writes, and-- which is available to you. So, if you go to, ah, our website, you can either go to beckinstitute.org and, uhm, click on, ah, the button that's on weight loss and maintenance, and that will get you to the other website. Or you can go directly to beckdietsolution.com. And there, you'll find blogs that Debbie writes. She, she writes every week about, ah, problems, specific dieter had and how she help the dieter overcome that problem. She writes daily diet tips. Uhm, we have newsletters that we send out periodically. We have a Facebook page. So, we're hoping that both you and your dieters will make use of some of these information that we're trying to disseminate. And I think that was the end of my announcement. So, while I'm interviewing the volunteers, Debbie's gonna tell you a little bit about the program. 

00:07:15
DEBORAH BECK BUSIS So, you could say that CBT runs in a family, or you could say that I like to run hotels, uhm, whichever. So, the program that we've developed is, ah, laid out in the book The Beck Diet Solution and it's laid out as a six-week program, ah, and each day has a different skill. But, it's really important to know that when we do this with clients, we spend minimum of one week on each skill. Uhm, because what we find is that, it's critical for clients to master each skill before moving on to the next one. What happens is, if clients move on too fast is that they get pretty good at the skills, and pretty good is fine as long as things in their life are going well. But the moment something stress will happens or they experience a life change, If they're only pretty good at the skills, the skills really fly right out the window. So, well, let's say, it's a six-week program, it's really somewhere between six weeks to six months, or more. Ah, the program is really based on the fact that we're teaching clients to eat in a really healthy way that they can maintain. Ah, and this means, including their favorite foods. We absolutely do not believe and hoping clients learn to cut out all sugar, uhm, or cut out all bread, or any food that really like. The reason for this is because if they cut it out now, uhm, but they really like it, we know for a fact that they're going to eat it again in the future. And if they haven't learned how to eat it in reasonable portion and staying control, when they eat it again in the future, they're going to go overboard and they're going to gain weight. So, well, we do teach clients to eat a really healthy diet. We make sure that it includes all of their favorite foods. Okay. The other thing that we do with clients right in the beginning is that we really let them know that the reason they have not been successful in the past is because they didn't know how. And we tell them that learning the diet successfully is really a matter of learning specific skills and these are skills that no one's ever taught them before. And sometimes, we'll give them the-- an analogy of-- you would never expect to sit down at the piano for the very first time and play something new, flawlessly. You would expect that you need to learn how to read music, uhm, start out with skills, maybe get a teacher, start out with easier pieces, practice them, get better and work up to harder pieces. You certainly would hit wrong notes along the way, uhm, but eventually, if you keep practicing, you would get better and better and better. And learning the diet is the exact same thing. Dieters tend to think that, ah, they should be able to pick up a diet book and follow it flawlessly from now until forever. But it just doesn't work that way. The reason they haven't been successful is because they haven't learned the skills. We also, ah, discuss with dieters the fact that anyone can make short-term changes in their behavior, and in fact, really every dieter we've ever worked with has lost at least some way in the past and many of them have lost actually large quantities of weight, several times, but they've always gained it back. And the reason for this is because, ah, what we found is that, if dieters want to make long-term changes in their behavior, it means they have to make changes in their thinking. So, what we really do with dieters, is we focused very strongly on the thought, or the automatic thought level. And we always say the clients, "What's coming up for you, that would be difficult this week. What thoughts might you have, that would lead you to eat. Let's come up with responses to them." We also have a really strong, ah, emphasis on our program on relapse prevention and really teaching clients what to do in the future when their motivation wanes in the future if they started to gain weight back. Uhm, just a little so that they don't end up gaining back everything that they lost. We also talk to clients about, uhm, taking the full dose. Meaning, ah, learning and practicing every skills that we have in the programs. Sometimes, they don't want to learn some of the skills, or they don't want to practice some of them. And we say to them, "If you had a really terrible headache, would you take half of an aspirin?" And they say, "No." Uhm, except to one client when he said, "Well, I don't take any medications. So, the answer is, I wouldn't even take half." Uhm, but she was the outlier. And so we say to clients, "If you had a really terrible headache, would you take half of an aspirin?" And they say, "No." And we say, "Why not?" And they say, "Because we wouldn't expect it to work." I mean, so we tell them that learning the whole program is like taking the full dose, and if you want it to work, if you want this time to be different, you have to take the full dose. So, what is the program? We've-- we've broken the program up into three different phases. 

00:11:40
The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:11:40
DEBORAH BECK BUSIS Phase one, we teach clients predicting skills, how to eat and, ah, uhm, practice good eating habits like eating everything, sitting down, eating everything slowly and mind-- mindfully. Ah, we teach them how to create time and energy. We also teach them how to overcome cravings, how to deal with cravings. We teach them how to deal with hunger without catastrophizing about it and how to, uhm, overcome emotional eating. And phase two, we teach clients how to eat according to schedule and we give ranges so it's not that they did at 12 pm, or they do it everyday. Uhm, and in phase two, we also do what we call advance dieting, if clients are ready for it, or if they need it which is following some type of formalized diet, uhm, planning what they're going to eat in advance and sticking to it. And finally, we worked with clients on phase three which is really maintenance. Uhm, long-term motivation, setting up systems for accountability. So, uhm, so there are either weighing in at a certain schedule each day or each week, so that they are filling out checklist, so they're making sure their skills are sharp, uhm, and we also help them deal with the, uhm, realistic notions of maybe they didn't get down to as then as they wanted to but learning to come to terms of where they are and how much better it is now from where they used to be. 

00:12:55
JUDITH BECK Thank you. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
JUDITH BECK And thank you to Julianne for being willing to volunteer. So, again, Julianne, as I mentioned before, uhm, this is not what I would typically do in, uhm, in my office but it's kind of a consultation. 

00:13:20
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:13:20
JUDITH BECK So, I thought that I would start by asking you, well, if, you know, if these were-- uhm, if you were in Philadelphia, you would first come for an intake evaluation and I get a lot of information about what is going on-- have been going on. But if I do that, that would probably take our entire session. So, I'm just gonna plunge right in of it. 

00:13:40
JULIANNE That's right. Perfect. 

00:13:40
JUDITH BECK Julianne, tell me what do you think is going to be difficult for you in the next few weeks. So, the holidays are coming up, your schedule maybe different. In terms of eating, what's gonna be difficult? 

00:13:50
JULIANNE Holiday would probably be number one. 

00:13:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:13:55
JULIANNE Uhm, once I wrap my head around, okay, I'm gonna do it, sugar craving comes up for me. 

00:14:00
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:14:00
JULIANNE Uhm, men, close your ears, PMS. 

00:14:05
JUDITH BECK Right. And when do you think, uhm, it's gonna be the most difficult for you in the next few weeks? 

00:14:15
JULIANNE Probably, the cravings around PMS. 

00:14:15
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:14:15
JULIANNE Probably the chocolate cravings and sugar cravings around PMS. 

00:14:20
JUDITH BECK Right. And, uhm, is that going to happen do you think this week, next week, or week after? 

00:14:25
JULIANNE It's somewhere in the next seven days. 

00:14:25
JUDITH BECK Well, okay. Great. Okay. So, can you tell me, uhm, when, when during the day do you think it's gonna be the most difficult. 

00:14:40
JULIANNE It's-- it's almost always night time. 

00:14:40
JUDITH BECK Right. And so-- and what time at night are you go-- are you going to start to notice the cravings? 

00:14:50
JULIANNE Between eight and nine. 

00:14:50
JUDITH BECK Okay. And where will you be? 

00:14:55
JULIANNE Watching TV. 

00:14:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. So you gonna be watching TV, anything good? 

00:14:55
JULIANNE I'm-- hopefully. Tebow, thank you, Tebow. 

00:15:00
JUDITH BECK And so you gonna be sitting on the couch? 

00:15:05
JULIANNE In bed. 

00:15:05
JUDITH BECK You're gonna be in bed, you gonna be watching TV, and what's gonna be going through your mind? 

00:15:10
JULIANNE I'm finally stopped, I'm finally-- I'm-- this is my downtime. I run crazy all day long and now, it's my-- I can breathe time. 

00:15:20
JUDITH BECK And then, what thoughts are going to lead you to one and get out of bed, and get something to eat? 

00:15:30
JULIANNE I can have just one. 

00:15:30
JUDITH BECK I can have just one. Okay. That is a terrific, uhm, what we call-- uhm, when we're working with dieters, ah, sabotaging thoughts, the automatic thoughts become sabotaging thought. I can have just one. And what is the just one that you can have? 

00:15:50
JULIANNE Ah, it usually involves fats, salt or sugar. 

00:15:55
JUDITH BECK So, what, what food do you think could be the most tempting to you? 

00:15:55
JULIANNE Well, what just came to my mind was a chocolate covered-- or a Joe-Joe. 

00:16:00
JUDITH BECK A Joe-Joe. Okay. And you have Joe-Joe's in the house? 

00:16:05
JULIANNE Yes. That's holiday gifts. 

00:16:05
JUDITH BECK It's holiday gifts. Okay. 

00:16:05
JULIANNE But there's always one person that really didn't deserve it. 

00:16:15
JUDITH BECK And is, is Joe-Joe a, ah, a cake kind of thing? 

00:16:20
JULIANNE It's a Trader Joe's Oreo cookie and they cover them in chocolate for the holidays. 

00:16:25
JUDITH BECK Wow, that's something great. 

00:16:25
JULIANNE They'd be really terribly, really, really good. 

00:16:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Okay. 

00:16:30
JULIANNE If this work, I'm gonna send you some. 

00:16:30
JUDITH BECK Oh, that would be terrific. Although my daughter Debbie lives in the same building in Philadelphia as the Trader Joe's. 

00:16:40
JULIANNE Oh, very good, so you don't have to wait. 

00:16:45
JUDITH BECK So, one-- well, you know, one thing that I'd like to, to tell you Julianne is that one of the things that works for me and seems to work for most of our dieters is to deliberately decide to have one favorite food every single day. 

00:17:00
JULIANNE Wow. 

00:17:00
JUDITH BECK So, I'm wondering if, uhm, you decided that you are going to have, uhm-- I know, how many Joe-Joe's would be reasonable to eat, do you think? I don't know how big they are. 

00:17:15
JULIANNE Uhm, well, a serving is probably two. 

00:17:15
JUDITH BECK Two. So, if you decided to have two Joe-Joe's every single evening, how do you think they would work for you? 

00:17:25
JULIANNE You know I have the mindset of you have to give it up or, you know - 

00:17:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:17:30
JULIANNE - it's terrifying to make it cuz it seems like it would be-- I would fail everyday. 

00:17:40
JUDITH BECK Okay. So, let's see, there are lot of different things we can talk about right now. So I'm gonna just make note so I don't forget. Uhm, so one is the thought I can have just one, the second one is, if I don't give it up completely, what I could be Julianne. 

00:17:55
JULIANNE I, I would never stop. 

00:17:55
JUDITH BECK I'll never stop. Is-- was there a torch kind of thought to, uhm, before the "I could have just one," I wondering whether there was some kind of thought like, this is my down time, I can breathe... 

00:18:10
JULIANNE Oh, it's my reward. 

00:18:10
JUDITH BECK This is my reward. 

00:18:10
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:18:10
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:18:15
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:18:15
JUDITH BECK So, having a Joe-Joe - 

00:18:15
JULIANNE I earned this. 

00:18:15
JUDITH BECK - will be my reward, I earned this. Any other thoughts like that you can think of? 

00:18:25
JULIANNE Not really. Nothing's come into mind. 

00:18:30
JUDITH BECK Okay. So we're gonna get back to the thoughts in just a minute, but I have a practical suggestion for you. Ah, and that is, is there some way that you can put aside two Joe-Joe's and either give the rest of the, the jar to a neighbor, uhm, or maybe keep them at your office and just bring to home with you, uhm, or put them someplace in your house, ah, where you just wouldn't get out of bed to go to like the trunk of your car, if you park outside, or stay put in a box, ah, stay put in a-- in a bag and you know, in the farthest reaches of your house. Could you make them kind of inaccessible? 

00:19:15
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:19:20
JUDITH BECK And so, where would you pick to keep them? 

00:19:20
JULIANNE I certainly wouldn't tell my teenagers where they are. 

00:19:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:19:25
JULIANNE Uhm, probably in the car. Although... 

00:19:25
JUDITH BECK Tell me about the car. 

00:19:30
JULIANNE Yeah. Well then, I'd be driving in the car the next day with the Joe-Joe's in the car, that was why I was thinking that maybe wasn't the good choice. 

00:19:40
JUDITH BECK Uhm, and, and how about keeping them in your office? 

00:19:40
JULIANNE Yeah, that would... 

00:19:45
JUDITH BECK Well, would that be... 

00:19:45
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:19:45
JUDITH BECK Would be a temptation all day? 

00:19:45
JULIANNE Uhm, well, my office is connected to my house. 

00:19:45
JUDITH BECK Oh, okay. 

00:19:45
JULIANNE But no-- but that's a good idea. 

00:19:50
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:19:50
JULIANNE I could put them on my office. 

00:19:50
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:19:50
JULIANNE I have a place I can keep them away in my office. 

00:19:50
JUDITH BECK That's-- that's great. Uhm, and so, uhm, I really want you to remember this, and I'm not only want you to remember it for right now, but if you were to go through the program - 

00:20:05
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:20:05
JUDITH BECK - and lose weight and be able to keep it off, if Joe-Joe's became a problem again five years from now, I would want you to have this note so you can remember - 

00:20:15
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:20:15
JUDITH BECK - Oh, yeah, I need to start keeping them in my office for right now. 

00:20:15
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:20:15
JUDITH BECK So, would you like me to write that down, or you wanna write it down? 

00:20:20
JULIANNE Uhm, either way. I, I can't imagine I would forget it, but, yeah, that would be great if would write it down. 

00:20:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. So the first thing we just talked about was keep Joe-Joe's in the office and what, uhm, only bring two into the kitchen. 

00:20:35
JULIANNE Into the house. 

00:20:35
JUDITH BECK Into the house. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
JUDITH BECK And will there be a problem of, ah, you're wanting to eat them between the time you get home and when you maybe really like to have on the date? 

00:20:55
JULIANNE Not really. 

00:20:55
JUDITH BECK So we can rule out that problem? 

00:20:55
JULIANNE No. Yes, yes. 

00:20:55
JUDITH BECK That's good. Okay. So, now, I have to have you imagine, it's, uhm, 8:30 whatever, and you've finished the two Joe-Joe's, right? 

00:21:05
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:21:10
JUDITH BECK Uhm, how you feeling now? 

00:21:10
JULIANNE Lot of anxiety. 

00:21:10
JUDITH BECK Aha. And what thought is going to your mind that makes you feel anxious? 

00:21:15
JULIANNE Uhm, that I won't be able to stop, uhm, that I just put 600 calories in my bodies for two stupid cookies, uhm, there I go again. 

00:21:35
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:21:35
JULIANNE Uhm... 

00:21:35
JUDITH BECK And what if these were your prescription and we're saying, uhm, what you've doing up till now, apparently hasn't been effective enough for you. 

00:21:45
JULIANNE Right. 

00:21:50
JUDITH BECK And what do you think will happen if you keep on doing the same things you've been doing? 

00:21:55
JULIANNE It takes all everything I just said away. 

00:21:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Ah, probably won't work. If you keep on doing what you've been doing, we have to try something different. So, I wonder whether having an extra-- are they really 300 calories each? 

00:22:10
JULIANNE They're pretty crazy. 

00:22:10
JUDITH BECK Aha. 

00:22:10
JULIANNE I mean, yes, they're pretty crazy. 

00:22:10
JUDITH BECK Okay. But that's fine, you know, if, uhm-- and if, uhm, if you want to start out by having two of them, that's completely fine. If you want to just start out by having one or have an optional, have either one or two that, that would be fine. 

00:22:25
JULIANNE Comparatively speaking, because I really-- my days are usually pretty clean. 

00:22:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:22:30
JULIANNE Two would be great progress. 

00:22:30
JUDITH BECK Yes. Exactly right. Two would be great progress. So, I'm gonna write-- can I write that down for you, too? 

00:22:35
JULIANNE Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:22:35
JUDITH BECK Remember, I need to do something different, differently because what I did before didn't work. Uhm, having two Joe-Joe's every night will be progress. 

00:23:00
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:23:00
JUDITH BECK Okay. So, you're in bed, it's 8:30, you've finished the two Joe-Joe's and, uhm, and now you're feeling anxious, now that you've finished the two? 

00:23:15
JULIANNE Uhm, I think that those are old thoughts. 

00:23:20
JUDITH BECK Aha. 

00:23:20
JULIANNE So, it might not be that way given the platform that you're setting out for me. 

00:23:25
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:23:25
JULIANNE Uhm, his-- historically. 

00:23:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:23:25
JULIANNE That would be, yeah. 

00:23:25
JUDITH BECK Well, so my question is this, are you gonna get out of bed and go to your office and get two more? 

00:23:35
JULIANNE I'm-- I consider myse-- I'm, I'm a professional dieter, I've been doing it for a lot of years. 

00:23:35
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:23:35
JULIANNE I think that I could probably stick with that. 

00:23:40
JUDITH BECK Great. 

00:23:40
JULIANNE If you're tempted to get out of bed, what would you like to be able to say to yourself at that moment? 

00:23:50
JUDITH BECK It wouldn't be a loving choice. 

00:23:55
JULIANNE So, if I get out of bed, it won't be a loving choice. I'm wondering if at that moment, it might be helpful too for you to remind yourself of all of the reasons sitting here right now that you know you actually don't wanna get out of bed because if I get out of bed and get more Joe-Joe's then, what will you be depriving yourself [00:24:21.11]of in your life? 

00:24:20
JUDITH BECK Oh, I can get magnet to the west. Uhm... 

00:24:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. So let's just start. If I get out of bed, it won't be a loving choice. I'll be depriving myself of? 

00:24:35
JULIANNE Health-- healthiness. 

00:24:35
JUDITH BECK Healthiness. 

00:24:35
JULIANNE Happiness. 

00:24:35
JUDITH BECK Yep. 

00:24:35
JULIANNE Freedom. 

00:24:40
JUDITH BECK Uhm-hmm. 

00:24:40
JULIANNE Joy. Uhm... 

00:24:45
JUDITH BECK And, in what ways would you be healthier? 

00:24:45
JULIANNE I would... 

00:24:45
JUDITH BECK If you were able to change your own weight? 

00:24:50
JULIANNE If I were able to-- if this behavior help change my weight? 

00:24:55
JUDITH BECK Well, this behavior plus a lot of other things. 

00:24:55
JULIANNE I would, uhm, I would be healthier because I wouldn't be carrying all this weight around on me. 

00:25:00
JUDITH BECK Yup. So, so, so now, what I'd like to do actually is just to change it a little bit and let's talk about all of the reas-- or some other reasons you have to lose weight. So, one is, uhm, will, will feel lighter in my body. 

00:25:15
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:25:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. What else? 

00:25:20
JULIANNE I want to be healthy for a perspective future grandchildren. 

00:25:25
JUDITH BECK Yes. So, you wanna be able to run around with them. 

00:25:25
JULIANNE Absolutely. Well, first I have to get that. 

00:25:30
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:25:30
JULIANNE But, yes. 

00:25:30
JUDITH BECK So, but in, in the future. 

00:25:30
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:25:30
JUDITH BECK That's why I started to go to the gym actually, Julianne, about seven or eight years ago. I had two goals. One was to put my luggage in the overhead rack on the airplane cuz I travel a lot. And the other one was I was hoping to have grandchildren at some point and I want to be able to carry them around, right? Seriously, right? 

00:25:55
JULIANNE Are you listening? 

00:25:55
JUDITH BECK Fortunately, her older sister has the, ah, jumped on her and now I have, ah, a, ah, 15-month, ah, grandchildren to carry around. 

00:26:05
JULIANNE That's right. 

00:26:05
JUDITH BECK So, uhm, but, anyway, so in the future, uhm, what are the kinds of thing she'd like to be able to do with your grandchildren to carry them around, what else? 

00:26:10
JULIANNE Uhm, just over or have more energy. 

00:26:15
JUDITH BECK Yup. 

00:26:15
JULIANNE You know, I'm really-- I'm dragging all of the time - 

00:26:20
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:26:20
JULIANNE - and I'm-- have a really chaotic crazy schedule that does not worth carrying around an extra - 

00:26:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:26:25
JULIANNE - 50 pounds. 

00:26:25
JUDITH BECK And what other reasons do you have for losing weight? 

00:26:35
JULIANNE I don't wanna look at myself in the mirror. 

00:26:35
JUDITH BECK Uhm-hmm. So feel better about how I look? 

00:26:35
JULIANNE Lot-- yeah, lot of-- so I have a lot of self-shame. 

00:26:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. So, feel better about how I look not feel, ah, so ashamed. 

00:26:50
JULIANNE I wanna model better eating for my children. 

00:26:50
JUDITH BECK Oh, that's good. 

00:26:50
JULIANNE And that's probably number one. 

00:26:55
JUDITH BECK Model... 

00:26:55
JULIANNE Even though it's number five. 

00:26:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Eating for my children. So, uhm, here is-- I'm going to-- if it's okay with you, we'll-- we'll stop this list now. 

00:27:05
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:27:05
JUDITH BECK But my suggestion is-- and I write it down here is to continue this list. 

00:27:05
JULIANNE Great. 

00:27:10
JUDITH BECK And what I think would be good is for you to, uhm, have a list, maybe of between 10 and 15 reasons. 

00:27:20
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:27:20
JUDITH BECK And try to make this list as compelling as possible. 

00:27:25
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:27:25
JUDITH BECK And then read the list every morning. I'm actually writing it on here for you. 

00:27:30
JULIANNE Thank you. 

00:27:35
JUDITH BECK Every morning. And pull out and read again, ah, before I eat the Joe- Joe's, or maybe before and after I eat the Joe-Joe's. Okay. And I think that you probably need to read this list everyday for weeks and weeks and weeks, if not months. So, how likely would you be-- would you be to read the list every single morning and at least for a while, ah, before you eat the Joe-Joe's. 

00:28:10
JULIANNE Extremely likely. 

00:28:10
JUDITH BECK Oh, some... 

00:28:10
JULIANNE I mean, uhm, none of these scenes come into my mind when I get into that mindset, so. 

00:28:15
JUDITH BECK Well, that's it exactly Julianne. You know, and what some people say is while I remember the list - 

00:28:20
JULIANNE No, I do not remember the list. 

00:28:20
JUDITH BECK - I don't have to read it and, and, you-- but you know, you know these, is that when the Joe-Joe's are calling your name, that list goes out of your mind, right? 

00:28:30
JULIANNE Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:28:30
JUDITH BECK Which is why you need to practice reading, ah, you have to practice these ideas over and over and over again. And if the list gets kind of stay all, it's good-- you could actually write each reason on a business size card or three by five card and shuffle the depth - 

00:28:45
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:28:45
JUDITH BECK - or maybe, I'll go through the depth and see which three are the most compelling to you though that day. 

00:28:50
JULIANNE It's a great idea. 

00:28:50
JUDITH BECK Or, uhm, or look at that the-- your top three and, uhm, imagine what would it be like, really imagine yourself in the future being lighter. 

00:29:00
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:29:00
JUDITH BECK And, uhm, having achieved some of these things. And, uhm, I have to remember, we're finishing at 11:20. Okay. Next, and I-- we go over another one of-- ah, another thought. Uhm, I am-- well, now, let me go back to this for another moment. You finished the Joe-Joe's, you've read the list either before right afterwards, uhm, now, how likely are you to go and get more Joe-Joe's? 

00:29:35
JULIANNE In this moment, not likely. 

00:29:35
JUDITH BECK Okay. How about for the rest of the evening? 

00:29:40
JULIANNE In this moment, not likely. 

00:29:40
JUDITH BECK Oh, oh, I'm sorry, okay. Got it. But, but now, I have to have you into the future, you're imagining, you're in-- are you eating the Joe-Joe's in bed? 

00:29:50
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:29:50
JUDITH BECK So, I don't know whether there'd be an advantage to not eating them in bed like having a no Joe-Joe eating in bed rule. Do you-- do you think that would help or wouldn't make a difference? And maybe you would have just a special place and I only eat Joe-Joe's in the special place. 

00:30:10
JULIANNE My children are all over those special places. 

00:30:15
JUDITH BECK Oh, oh, so they are-- they are still awake then? 

00:30:15
JULIANNE Oh, yeah, they are teenagers. 

00:30:20
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:30:20
JULIANNE So, my - 

00:30:20
JUDITH BECK Oh. 

00:30:20
JULIANNE - bed is my special place. I have thread now next to the bed which they can eat the Joe-Joe's on but something seems very long ago. 

00:30:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And if, if your kids saw you eating the Joe-Joe's, can you tell me what would be on that bed? 

00:30:35
JULIANNE Oh, that wouldn't-- other than having to have six Joe-Joe's because there are three of us. 

00:30:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:30:40
JULIANNE It wouldn't be a problem. 

00:30:40
JUDITH BECK And would you rather that they not eat the Joe-Joe's? 

00:30:45
JULIANNE No, I, I think ultimately I have to model - 

00:30:45
JUDITH BECK Aha. 

00:30:45
JULIANNE - what is, you know, kind of bad behavior for that. 

00:30:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:30:50
JULIANNE So it, it wouldn't face me either way. 

00:30:50
JUDITH BECK Uhm... 

00:30:50
JULIANNE It might actually be kind of a cool ritual thing. 

00:30:55
JUDITH BECK Oh, that's what I was just thinking. 

00:30:55
JULIANNE In which is, we could it in the living room. 

00:31:00
JUDITH BECK Uhm, great. So, what should I write down about this? 

00:31:00
JULIANNE A no eating zone in the bed would probably be, although very scary, a very good policy. 

00:31:05
JUDITH BECK Okay. No eating zone in bed. And I'm gonna get back to that in a minute, uhm, and then, what you just said was each Joe-Joe's... 

00:31:15
JULIANNE Has a ritual with my kids. 

00:31:15
JUDITH BECK Has a ritual with your kids. 

00:31:15
JULIANNE It seems crazy. 

00:31:20
JUDITH BECK And if your kids aren't home or they don't want it, then, you would do it, ah, in the living room, anyway? 

00:31:25
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:31:25
JUDITH BECK Is that what you're saying? 

00:31:25
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:31:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. Okay. That to no eating zone in bed. So, ah, another way of saying this is, uhm, no choice, no eating zone. So, let me tell you that no choice for a moment, if that's okay and - 

00:31:45
JULIANNE Please. 

00:31:50
JUDITH BECK - and tell me whether this concept is useful to you. When you, uhm, get in the car, do you always put on your seat belt? 

00:31:55
JULIANNE Put, no. Not always. 

00:32:05
JUDITH BECK Uhm, do you always, uhm, ah, change from pajamas into clothes before you, ah, go to work? 

00:32:10
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:32:10
JUDITH BECK Always? 

00:32:10
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:32:10
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:32:15
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:32:15
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:32:15
JULIANNE Never wear pajamas to work. 

00:32:15
JUDITH BECK Never wear pajamas to work. That's good. Now, do you say to yourself when you're in your pajamas, "Well, I know I really should, uhm, change into my work clothes, but I don't really feel like it." And then you say to yourself, "No, no, that's ridiculous." You really have to. And then do you say to yourself, "Well, maybe won't really matter this one time," and then you say to yourself, "No, of course, it will matter." And then you say, "Well, I just don't feel like it." Do you ever go through that struggle? 

00:32:45
JULIANNE No. 

00:32:50
JUDITH BECK Few? Now, do you know why you don't go through that struggle? It's because you have put where, you know, changing clothes into your no choice category. You don't even think about. It is just no choice's absolutely what I'm going to do. So, I'm wondering whether that concept might help you with eating in bed. No choice. I absolutely, I just-- I'm not doing this anymore. Does that concept help, or doesn't really reason that... 

00:33:15
JULIANNE It's very much so. 

00:33:15
JUDITH BECK It does. 

00:33:15
JULIANNE It's just filled with a lot of fear. 

00:33:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. So we'll get back to that in a moment. Ah, so, and I wrote down, no eating zone in bed, no choice, just like... 

00:33:30
JULIANNE And I almost always wear my seat belt. 

00:33:30
JUDITH BECK Change-- oh, so we put it-- can we put it down the seat belt one probably. Changing into, uhm, work clothes. Okay. And so, when you think about not eating in bed sounds like you feel anxious. 

00:33:45
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:33:45
JUDITH BECK So, what thought makes you feel anxious about not eating in bed. If I don't eat in bed... 

00:33:50
JULIANNE There's a whole security - 

00:33:50
JUDITH BECK Aha. 

00:33:50
JULIANNE - around getting in bed under my down comforter and putting on the TV, and eating. 

00:34:00
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:34:00
JULIANNE That is part of my, uhm, shutting out the world and my time. And I'm afraid that I would lose that. That there would be... 

00:34:10
JUDITH BECK Oh. 

00:34:10
JULIANNE That would be replaced with the anxiety of, oh, my God, I don't have food in my space with my TV and my... 

00:34:15
JUDITH BECK And so, it's-- if I don't, uhm, ah, have food along with my other-- ah, I just call them, ah, maybe, ah, bed, bed rituals - 

00:34:30
JULIANNE Yeah. 

00:34:30
JUDITH BECK - having the covers up, being warm and cozy watching TV and stuff like that. If I don't have, ah, food along with these, then, what are you afraid will happen? 

00:34:40
JULIANNE It's crazy even to be saying this and to be putting that together. But that it will somehow diminish bad experience from me. 

00:34:50
JUDITH BECK It will diminish bad experience for me. And by how much will it diminish here? 

00:34:55
JULIANNE Well, as I'm... 

00:34:55
JUDITH BECK 100% or it's just terrible to lie there, or... 

00:34:55
JULIANNE As I'm saying it, it doesn't feel-- it feels like an irrational belief. 

00:35:00
JUDITH BECK Aha. And so, uhm, I-- ah, you know, I think it probably, uhm, very short term will be accurate, but it will diminish it. 

00:35:10
JULIANNE Right. 

00:35:10
JUDITH BECK Because, uhm, of course, you're not gonna wanna make this change. 

00:35:15
JULIANNE Right. 

00:35:15
JUDITH BECK Uhm, but let me ask you this, is, ah-- how long does that experience usually last for eve-- every evening? 

00:35:25
JULIANNE Three hours of the most. 

00:35:25
JUDITH BECK So, that's three hours. 

00:35:30
JULIANNE Nine till midnight. 

00:35:30
JUDITH BECK And, uhm, how much is, uhm, the rest of your day diminish by, uhm, not feeling as healthy, by not having very much energy, by not feeling good when you're looking the mirror, by not, ah, modeling better eating for your kids... 

00:35:45
JULIANNE Why did I know, you are going there. I was already calculating the hours in my head. 

00:35:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:35:50
JULIANNE Twenty-one, easily. 

00:35:55
JUDITH BECK Twenty-one hours. 

00:35:55
JULIANNE Easily. 

00:35:55
JUDITH BECK Right. Well, you're sleeping for some of that but, uhm, but for the rest of your waking hours. So, is there something about that you'd like me to write down? So, uhm... 

00:36:05
JULIANNE What is the prize I've had. 

00:36:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah, so maybe-- can I start it out this way - 

00:36:05
JULIANNE Please. 

00:36:10
JUDITH BECK - if I get anxious about not having food in bed remind myself as-- can I sort out that way? 

00:36:15
JULIANNE Please. 

00:36:15
JUDITH BECK So, if I get anxious... 

00:36:15
JULIANNE You seemed to have much better ideas than I do. 

00:36:20
JUDITH BECK Well, in Philadelphia, it's a lot longer. Uhm, if I get anxious about not eating in bed remind myself-- what would you like to remind yourself? 

00:36:35
JULIANNE First thought, was that my children are worth more than the experience of eating. 

00:36:40
JUDITH BECK Oh, that's good. My children are worth more than my experience with eating. And how about this idea that my experience may be diminished some for three hours, uhm, but-- can I sort out that way? 

00:37:00
JULIANNE Please. 

00:37:05
JUDITH BECK So, my experience may be diminished some-- and I'm gonna put temporarily cuz I'm gonna come back and ask you another question about that-- for three hours. But-- let's see, if you're awake 18 hours a day minus three would be 15 hours. Uhm, but if I do eat in bed-- what should I say about those 15 hours? 

00:37:30
JULIANNE Those 15 hours are diminished, uhm, considerably. 

00:37:35
JUDITH BECK Those other 15 hours will be diminished considerably. Is that strong enough do you think? 

00:37:45
JULIANNE Yeah. 

00:37:50
JUDITH BECK Okay. That's good. Uhm, get back to temporarily, so let's say, uhm, you have been able to eat only two Joe-Joe's in the living room with your kids and you gonna need more skills, I think, to stop eating in bed entirely. But when you do, and let's say you've gone through an entire month of not eating in bed, how do you think you're gonna feel? 

00:38:15
JULIANNE Really good. 

00:38:15
JUDITH BECK Really good. And how are you going to feel when you're in bed, not eating? 

00:38:20
JULIANNE Proud of my accomplishment. 

00:38:20
JUDITH BECK Really proud. So, I wonder whether this diminishment of the experience might be only temporary till you really master the skill of not eating in bed - 

00:38:35
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:38:35
JUDITH BECK - and then you're lying in bed and you're feeling really comfortable, and the you got the quilt and the TV's on, and you're relaxing and you're also feeling so proud of yourself. 

00:38:45
JULIANNE Definite different vision. 

00:38:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And can you just, just sitting here, tell me which one feels better to you? 

00:38:55
JULIANNE Definitely the vision of pride. 

00:38:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. So, uhm, so, is that okay if I put that down? 

00:39:00
JULIANNE Please. 

00:39:00
JUDITH BECK So, after, uhm-- I don't know, might, might only take three days, five days, month, I don't know how long it will take. But let's just say it will take a month. After a we-- a month of not eating in bed, my bed experience what, will be even better? 

00:39:25
JULIANNE Yes. And it's funny, I'm so prone to the idea of leaving the bed foods out - 

00:39:30
JUDITH BECK Uhm-hmm. 

00:39:30
JULIANNE - that all that keeps going onto my head is, but if I could just not have those two Joe-Joe's also. 

00:39:35
JUDITH BECK Yeah. You know, I just think, uhm, for most people, you may be an exception although your - 

00:39:40
JULIANNE Probably not. 

00:39:40
JUDITH BECK - your history doesn't sound like it's an exception. 

00:39:40
JULIANNE Probably not an exception. 

00:39:45
JUDITH BECK It's so important, I mean, food-- we've ought to be able to enjoy food. 

00:39:45
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:39:50
JUDITH BECK Uhm, and I think it's not a good idea to eat food that's, you know, not very healthy for us in great quantities everyday. 

00:40:00
JULIANNE Right. 

00:40:00
JUDITH BECK But in my experience, it's so important to have, uhm, whatever your favorite food is everyday, and I'm gonna tell you why for two reasons. I don't know whether these will be applicable to you or not. So, uhm, I can talk from my own experience and di-- other dieter's experiences, is, if you have the Joe-Joe's to look forward to every night, it's so much easier to turn down the brownies that someone has brought-- oh, yeah, I worked in a larger office-- or, or not to buy the, ah, ice cream - 

00:40:30
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:40:30
JUDITH BECK - at the supermarket. Or when you're at the party, not to have the dessert - 

00:40:35
JULIANNE That makes sense. 

00:40:35
JUDITH BECK the host just has made. Because Joe-Joe's are your favorite - 

00:40:40
JULIANNE That makes sense. 

00:40:40
JUDITH BECK - and you-- and you say, "Well, if I have this now, it's gonna make me feel bad." 

00:40:45
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:40:45
JUDITH BECK And, "I really love Joe-Joe's and I know I can have them tonight." 

00:40:50
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:40:50
JUDITH BECK So, it, it helps restrict-- or it, it helps you kind of put the reins on eating unhealthy food during the day if you know you have that reward. 

00:41:00
JULIANNE That'll make sense. 

00:41:00
JUDITH BECK The other thing that, uhm, that-- oh, so I'm gonna write that down in the minute, but the other reason to have a favorite food everyday, uhm, is because, you've finished the Joe-Joe's and then you say to yourself, "This is so great cuz I, I can have Joe-Joe's again tomorrow, in the next day, in the day after that and everyday for the rest of my life." 

00:41:25
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:41:25
JUDITH BECK So, it, it diminishes this compulsion to have more Joe-Joe's right away. 

00:41:30
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:41:30
JUDITH BECK So, I don't know if this is true of you, but what happens with a lot of people is that they have to say, ice cream, uhm, which they promise themselves that they're never going to have, they have ice cream and then, they think, "Well, I never gonna be able to have it again so I might as well eat as much ice cream as I possibly can and start again tomorrow." Yet, if they were able to say to themselves, uhm, "I can have ice cream every single day, I don't need to have more of it now." 

00:42:00
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:42:00
JUDITH BECK Then, it's easier again to put the reins on. 

00:42:05
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:42:05
JUDITH BECK So, is, is that compelling for you? 

00:42:05
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:42:05
JUDITH BECK Okay. So, we're gonna put down. There are actually so three reasons to eat two Joe-Joe's, and you're allowed to switch it up. So, another food becomes your favorite. 

00:42:20
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:42:20
JUDITH BECK Or this is something that I do, uhm, when, uhm, people bring a lot of junk food and stuff into the office, if there's something that I really like, I just wrap a piece and I take it home and have it at night. 

00:42:30
JULIANNE That's great. That's great. 

00:42:30
JUDITH BECK Is that when I would really like to have it like you? 

00:42:35
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:42:35
JUDITH BECK In the evening time? 

00:42:35
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:42:35
JUDITH BECK So, re-- three reasons to eat two Joe-Joe's everyday... 

00:42:40
JULIANNE I love that you're having that. That's great. 

00:42:45
JUDITH BECK So, one is, uhm-- and, uhm, ah, I should-- I deserve, I'm gonna put, uhm, to eat my favorite food. And the second is, eating it everyday or knowing I can eat it everyday will help me put on the reins when I finished. And then, the next thing we just said was, uhm-- hold on, or do you remember what that was? 

00:43:30
JULIANNE I, I... 

00:43:30
JUDITH BECK Oh, it, it will help me post it-- it will help me resist, uhm... 

00:43:40
JULIANNE Other choices. 

00:43:40
JUDITH BECK Other choices. Other-- I'm gonna put just junk food choices, you know what I mean, junk food choices throughout the day. 

00:43:50
JULIANNE In the past when I've had that, that strong belief that there are infinite supplies. 

00:43:55
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:43:55
JULIANNE It has been successful for me. 

00:43:55
JUDITH BECK Oh, good. 

00:43:55
JULIANNE So... 

00:44:00
JUDITH BECK And did you say you also like the idea if some other food actually should fancy... 

00:44:00
JULIANNE Absolutely, that was-- that was huge. Yeah. 

00:44:05
JUDITH BECK So, if another food catches my fancy, wrap it up and bring it home. 

00:44:15
JULIANNE That's great. 

00:44:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. So, if it's okay, I just like to summarize some of the things that we talked about and see how much we agree with each one of them. So one, ah, to keep your-- the Joe-Joe's in the office and bring only two into the house at a time. Do you buy that 100%? 

00:44:40
JULIANNE 100%. 

00:44:40
JUDITH BECK Right. So, I'm gonna put 100% next to that. Remember, I need to do something differently because what I did before didn't work. 

00:44:50
JULIANNE A 110%. 

00:44:50
JUDITH BECK A 110%. Ah, having two Joe-Joe's every night will be progress. 

00:44:55
JULIANNE Yes, absolutely. 

00:44:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. If I get out of bed, it, ah, won't be a loving choice, I will be depriving myself of being healthier, happiness, freedom, joy, uhm-- yes, so how much do you believe that? 

00:45:10
JULIANNE More than any other. 

00:45:10
JUDITH BECK Okay. Uhm, there are reasons I wanna lose weight, I wanna feel lighter in my body, I-- I can't read my writing-- oh, my grandchildren, to be able to carry them around, or have more energy, I feel better about how I look, won't feel so ashamed, I will model better eating for children. So how important are those reasons? 

00:45:40
JULIANNE Ex-- life altering reasons. 

00:45:40
JUDITH BECK Okay. So I'm gonna put that down, life altering reasons. And, how likely are you to, now, continue the list and read the list every morning and again, before you eat the Joe-Joe's? 

00:45:55
JULIANNE It is a commitment to have make it. 

00:45:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. So, I put 100% next to that. And, ah, how about this, no eating zone in bed, no choice, just like changing into work clothes. 

00:46:10
JULIANNE Ninety-eight and 100%. 

00:46:10
JUDITH BECK Well, I have to say that, that this is the habit that you've had for a while. 

00:46:20
JULIANNE Yes. 

00:46:20
JUDITH BECK And so, uhm, you might need to work more on that. 

00:46:25
JULIANNE Okay. 

00:46:25
JUDITH BECK And we have-- as Debbie mentioned, you probably didn't hear it at the beginning, but Debbie mentioned a lot of strategies that we teach dieters actually before we ask them to change their eating. 

00:46:35
JULIANNE Beautiful. 

00:46:35
JUDITH BECK And so, one of my recommendations is that if what we talked about today make sense is that you may want to, uhm, look at the program in the book and try to follow it yourself. 

00:46:45
JULIANNE Great. 

00:46:45
JUDITH BECK Uhm, because I do think that this one is gonna be more difficult. So if we had more time, we would definitely go into that. Eat Joe-Joe's as a ritual with kids in the living room. 

00:46:55
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:46:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. If I, uhm-- oh, if, I get anxious about not eating in bed remind myself, my children are worth more than of my experience of eating. 100%? 

00:47:10
JULIANNE A 100%. 

00:47:15
JUDITH BECK Uhm, my experience maybe diminished some, and temporarily for three hours, but if I do eat in bed, those other 15 hours will be diminished considerably. 

00:47:20
JULIANNE 100%. 

00:47:25
JUDITH BECK After a month of not eating in bed, my bed experience will be even better-- oh, I forgot, because I'll be proud. How much do you believe that? 

00:47:35
JULIANNE 100%. 

00:47:35
JUDITH BECK Ah, three reasons to eat two Joe-Joe's everyday, I deserve to eat my favorite, uhm, foods, knowing that I can eat them everyday, will help, uhm, help with-- oh, will help me stop when I'm-- when I'm finished, I think it was. How-- oh, put on the reins, that's what it says, thank you. I'm gonna write it a little bit more neatly, put on the reins. 

00:48:10
JULIANNE When it gets warmer where you live, I may come visit you. 

00:48:10
JUDITH BECK Ah, and you what I just realize, this is being videotaped. So you can watch it. 

00:48:15
JULIANNE Oh, boy. Okay. 

00:48:20
JUDITH BECK All right. And if you can't read my notes, you'll be able to hear it. So that's good. And, let's see, I think they have another note. Uhm, to continue the reasons to eat two Joe-Joe's a day will help me resist other junk food throughout the day. So, how much do you-- how, ah, much do you believe those three reasons? 

00:48:45
JULIANNE A 100%. 

00:48:45
JUDITH BECK Okay. And then you just like this tip, if another food catches my fancy, wrap it up and bring it home. 

00:48:50
JULIANNE It's a great tip. A 100%. 

00:48:50
JUDITH BECK All right. Okay. So, uhm, any final thoughts or questions you have for me? 

00:49:00
JULIANNE Uhm, the plan of action feels empowering. 

00:49:05
JUDITH BECK Great. And again, ah, Julianne, uhm, it's easy to sit up here and make the commitments? 

00:49:10
JULIANNE Not really. Just sitting up here makes me somewhat, somewhat easier. 

00:49:10
JUDITH BECK Oh, right. I should have said-- it's, it's-- I should have left out to sit up here, it's easier to uhm, make, ah-- that it's easier to make the commitment sitting here, but I haven't really equipped to you with all of the skills that you need. So, if you had come to see me in my office, we would have started off by saying, whatever you do with Joe-Joe's for right now is completely fine. In fact, uhm, Julianne, I don't want you to pay much attention or make changes in the food that you're eating right now. It's, it's, you know, if you wanna be careful, that's fine, but just-- you can keep on doing what you're doing. Because it's so crucial to master three dieting skills before you change your eating. And so, first, we would just be working on getting you to read this list every single morning. 

00:50:05
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:50:05
JUDITH BECK Uhm, and maybe pull it out in the evening, if you wanted to do that was well. Then, we would be working on getting you to eat everything, sitting down. 

00:50:15
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:50:15
JUDITH BECK Uhm, and then we would work on getting you to give yourself credit for eating everything, sitting down - 

00:50:20
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:50:20
JUDITH BECK - and for reading your list everyday and for, uhm, making, ah, healthy food decisions or healthy eating decisions every single times. We would build up your sense of self-efficacy in that way. Uhm, then, the next thing we would do is work on getting you to eat everything slowly and mindfully, and enjoying every bite. 

00:50:40
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:50:40
JUDITH BECK And the next thing we would work on is creating more time and energy, ah, for you to make sure that you can continue to practice the skills and you're gonna need more time later when you make changes in your eating cuz you may have to go to the supermarket more often, you may need to have more time to prepare your food, things like that. And then, uhm, another thing that we would work on, is, uhm, exactly what you can do when you're hungry or you, ah, have a craving or you wanna eat for emotional reasons. 

00:51:10
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:51:10
JUDITH BECK We would work on, what you can do, ah, specifically with the ultimate goal of just getting you to tolerate, you know. So, I'm, I'm feeling hungry but I know of eating lunch in another hour, so what? You know, I'm just-- let me, let me turn my attention back to what I'm doing. That would be the ultimate goal. And then-- so you would learn and there's some other skills too, we would have you really not just learn the skills but master the skills one by one, and not move on to another skill until you had mastered the previous ones. Then, we would finally start talking about changing your schedule of eating, uhm, and, and have you, uhm-- if, if-- and this is difficult for some dieters, kind of give up the notion of spontaneous eating. Oh, I wanted to be able to decide right at the moment whether or not I'm going to have ice cream. But we'd have-- you have some kind of flexible schedule of eating, we might have to work with that a little bit. You would master that, you would then learn the skill of when you make a mistake and you eat at a non-schedule time of how to get yourself back on track immediately - 

00:52:15
JULIANNE Uhm-hmm. 

00:52:20
JUDITH BECK - and not wait for the next day. And you like most people with these kind of, ah, sabotaging thought, right? 

00:52:20
JULIANNE It's done. I'm eating now. 

00:52:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. I, I-- I've cheated, I am so weak, I'm so bad, I'm gonna eat whatever I want and start again tomorrow. So, we'd have to work really hard on that thought. Uhm, and, ah, then we-- after we did that, we would finally move on to changing what you eat. So, we've kind of just dropped in the middle of these. So, don't be surprised if you have some difficulty implementing some of these things. But the skills are all outlined and so, you can know yourself, and, uhm, hope that you'll e-mail us and keep in touch and, that is now how you did. 

00:52:55
JULIANNE Absolutely. 

00:52:55
JUDITH BECK And thank you so much for volunteering. Sure. 

00:52:55
JULIANNE Okay. Thank-- thank you so much. Thank you. 

00:53:00
JUDITH BECK Goodbye. Well, oh, wait a minute, your notes, your notes, your notes, your notes. There you go. 

00:53:10
JULIANNE Thank you.

00:53:10
JUDITH BECK So, uhm, again, that was a consultation, not a regular diet coaching session that we would have, but you could see, I hope, uhm, what a strong focus we have on identifying the automatic thoughts that, ah, Julianne might have and we came up with responses to them. We did some practical problem solving and, uhm, most of all e-- especially in terms of eating two Joe-Joe's a day, what we wanna do is the ought of the possible. It is unlikely that Julianne can go though her whole life and never eat Joe-Joe's again. And she enjoys them and the reasons that she doesn't have to do that. And once we started finally to talk about her eating, again, we would ask her not to make any changes in her eating that she can't keep up with her whole life. And we would probably have to talk about portion control and if she's not eating in a healthy way, adding in some, ah, healthier foods to that and making sure that she's not trying to eat too few calories a day because one recipe for disaster is, if she's trying to cut her calories too low, to the extent that she won't be able to keep it up for years and years and years, she's gonna just naturally start eating more calories and when she does, the minute she-- her weight plateaus and she starts eating a hundred calories more which is like a large apple a day, is the minute she's gonna start gaining weight back. And so, we won't really know what her ideal weight is and what her ideal, ah, kind of calorie level is until we get there. And what we wanna have shown into is to create a new way of eating for her whole life and so, ah, Julianne dieting will be no different from maintenance. Whatever you do to lose weight, that's what you gonna continue to do for your whole life which is why we don't ever want you to give up Joe-Joe's. So, thank you again for volunteering. And thank you. So, if you would just make sure, if you would like to get a copy of the slides from the diet workshop, ah, Karen is sitting over there in the first row on the very last seat over, she's gonna collect them for me and I will get them later, cuz I'm off to another, ah, panel discussion.
