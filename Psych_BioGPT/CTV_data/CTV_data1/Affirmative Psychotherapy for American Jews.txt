00:00:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER  Thank you very much for coming this morning. Ah, I'm Dr. Lewis Schlosser, and today I'm gonna be talking about Affirmative Psychotherapy for American Jews. Okay, and before I begin, ah, I wanted to dedicate this lecture to my wife, Kimberly Edelson Schlosser and our daughter, Emma Claire Schlosser, who are my support and my biggest fans and make it possible for me to do what I do everyday. So, let me tell you before we begin, kind of where we're going. So, these are the four things that I'm gonna talk about today. 

00:00:45
Purpose of Presentation Reduce reliance on stereotypes and assumptions about American Jews Identify Jews as an American ethnic minority Provide introduction to Jews and Jewish culture Discuss tenets of culturally appropriate psychotherapy with American Jews 

00:00:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER First, I wanna help people reduce their reliance on stereotypes and assumptions about American Jews, and their clinical practice with American Jews, as well as, when they think about doing research with American Jews. Ah, secondly, I'm gonna identify Jews as an eth, as an eth, American ethnic minority group and I'll talk more about that in a minute. Then, I'll provide you with a brief introduction to Jews and Jewish culture. This will be kind of a primer. I will not go in depth into this area, but wanna give you a taste about who are Jews, a little bit about them. And then finally, I'll discuss the tenets of culturally appropriate, culturally appropriate psychotherapy with American Jews. So, this is what we've got going on today. Before we begin, there's a few semantic issues that I wanna talk with you about. The fir, and some of these ah, are simply about grammar and others are more important. The first is the term antisemitism, which you'll see on the slides, I spell without the hyphen. 

00:01:35
Antisemitism vs. Anti-Semitism Anti-Semitism first coined by Wilhelm Marr in 1879 to express anti-Jewish feelings Many now use "antisemitism" to prevent co-opting of this word for anything other than its original intent: Jew-hatred For example, some Arab groups claim they cannot be "anti-Semitic" since they themselves are Semitic Hence, eliminating the hyphen takes the focus away from the term "Semitic" 

00:01:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well, the term antisemitism was actually first coined back in the late 1800s by Wilhelm Marr, and the term was coin to express anti-Jewish feelings. Okay? However, in recent times some folks in the Middle East have said, "Well, I can't be anti-Semitic because I'm in fact Semitic, so I cannot hate myself." So, some scholars have ceased to hyphenate this word as anti-Semitic, so that people would no longer caught this term for something other than it was its original intentions, which is Jew hatred. So, eliminating the hyphen takes the focus away from Semitic and helps people recognize that this term is designed to articulate Jew hatred. So when you see my slides, this was done deliberately. The second is the- 

00:02:20
American Jews vs. Jewish Americans Emphasizes the primacy of being Jewish through use of American as a descriptor of Jew Acknowledges the nomadic heritage of Jews as a Diaspora people who often needed to flee when antisemitism reached dangerous levels Of course, within-group differences exist, and some may prefer Jewish American 

00:02:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - distinction of calling Jews, American Jews in this country versus Jewish Americans, which is probably the more common practice among cultural minorities. Certainly referred to African-Americans, Asian-Americans. Ah, but I'm gonna specifically refer to Jews as American Jews because it, it emphasizes the primacy of being Jewish with American being the descriptor of Jew as opposed to Jew being the descriptor of American. And this is done deliberately to acknowledge the needs of Jews as a diaspora people, who often have had to flee the countries in which they live when antisemitism reached dangerous levels. However, in your counters, in your clinical work, you may come across Jews who prefer to refer to themselves as Jewish American, because within group, differences exist. But today, I'll be talking about American Jews. Ah, and two more semantic issues to let you know about, one is that its typical- 

00:03:10
Two more semantic issues It is typical practice for religious Jews to omit the "o" in spelling G-d This is done because Judaism prohibits erasing or destroying any Hebrew name of G-d This is not a typo Shoah: "Catastrophe" from Hebrew, referring to the catastrophic destruction of European Jewry during WWII by Nazi Germany (aka the Holocaust) 

00:03:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - practice for American Jews to omit the "o" when they spell God's name. Okay? This is because, this is done because we, uhm, Hebrew tradition prohibits the distraction of any Hebrew name of God. And so a little anecdote about this is I've actually done some scholarship in the area of antisematism in American Jews and had an editor ah, suggest to me that I had a number of typos in my manuscript. Ah, there were no typos of course but then reference that I had spelled God, G-d. So even in the editor of, of cultural issues and ah, it was a very big handbook of multicultural psychology, there's still education that needs to be done. And finally, when I refer, you see the term Shoah, when I refer to the term Shoah, that is, it literally means catastrophe in Hebrew, and this is the preferred term among many when referring to the, the Holocaust that occurred in World War II, where roughly six million Jews were killed. Okay. So this is the semantic issues. Now, first let's talk a little bit about American Jews as an ethnic minority group. Uhm, statistically- 

00:04:15
American Jews: An Ethnic Minority Jews comprise about 2% of the U.S. population Ethnic group is "a group of people who live, or once lived, in close proximity to one another and, as a consequence, share ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving learning from similar life circumstances shared over generations" (Fouad & Brown, 2000, p.381) Hence, Jews should be categorized as an ethnic minority group 

00:04:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - Jews comprise just under two percent of the U.S. population. I think the latest figures have us at about 1.8 percent. Uhm, and I'll call your attention to the screen that you'll see that, and I'm gonna give you a definition, and I normally don't like to read from slides, but this is an important one. This is the definition of ethnic group. An ethnic group is a group of people who live or once lived in close proximity to one another and, as a consequence, share ways of thinking, feeling and behaving, learning from similar life circ, circumstances, shared over generations. If you take that definition of ethnic group and you consider the demography of the United States with Jews being about two percent of the population, I think it's fair to say that Jews should be categorized as an ethnic minority group. Okay. Unfortunately, they are not at present and there are some other things I can present to you that will help buttress this position. The first of which is antisemitism, which many people have said, antisemitism is not a problem any longer, antisemitism is going away. Well, in a recent poll by the Anti-Defamation League, which is published in 2005,- 

00:05:20
Antisemitism 14% of Americans hold strongly antisemitic views (ADL, 2005) 17% increase in reported antisemitic incidents 1,821 in 2004; up from 1557 in 2003 Highest number of incidents in the past 9 years 954 (70%) of the 1,374 religiously-motivated hate crimes in the U.S. during 2004 were exclusively anti-Jewish; this represents 12% of all 2004 bias crimes (FBI, 2005) 

00:05:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - 14 percent of Americans hold strongly antisemitic views. Now, I want you to stop for a second and consider the fact that 14 percent is roughly one in six. Okay, so roughly one in six people hold strongly antisemitic views. And two, I want you to consider the methodology used which is people from the Anti-Defamation League, hired a research firm to call people randomly and assess their views on Jews. So what I mean is that one in six people feel quite comfortable telling a stranger over the phone, that they don't care for Jews. In our politically correct climate, that is a pretty scary thought. In addition, the FBI keeps track of ah, hate crimes, hate motivated crimes. And there's been a 17 percent increase in reported antisemitic incidence. Uhm, so from 2003 to 2004, you'll see that the incidence went up from a roughly 1,500 incidents to over 1,800 incidents, from 2003 to 2004. And the figure in 2004 represents the highest number of antisemitic incidents in the, in nearly last decade. Okay. In addition, 70 percent of the roughly 1,400 religiously motivated hate crimes in the U.S. during 2004 were exclusively anti-Jewish. Okay. Seventy percent, so seven out of every ten religiously motivated hate crimes were exclusively anti-Jewish. In addition, that represents 12 percent of all biased crimes in 2004. So every time there was a hate crime, roughly one in ten times, it was against the Jew. So antisemitism, unfortunately, is very much in existence today. Okay. In addition, it's very important to know, for those of you who are gonna be working in clinical practice, you are very likely to have a Jewish client. So, that's why this is, it is important for you to understand, Jews as an, as a distinct cultural group. 

00:07:10
You will have a Jewish client Jews are more likely to seek mental health treatment than Catholics, Protestants, "others" and those who indicated "no religion" (Yeung & Greenwald, 1992) American Jews might seek psychotherapy for coping with experiences of antisemitism or for other reasons The experience of antisemitism might be a stressor for American Jews that negatively affects and/or compounds The presenting problem(s) 

00:07:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER  Researches show that Jews are much more likely to seek mental health treatment, than people from other religions. Uhm, and American Jews, just as an example, might seek psychotherapy services to cope with experiences of antisemitism, as well as, for any sort of on, other reason, that any would, might seek psychotherapy, depression, stress, anxiety, etcetera. Uhm, but it's important for the clinician to note that the experience of antisemitism- might be a stressor for American Jews, which is gonna negatively affect and/or compound the presenting problem. And later on, on my talk, when I talk about the tenets of culturally appropriate psychotherapy, I'll get into this a bit more. Okay? So, all right it's 2007, Jews have been around for a little while now, so why has it taken so long for psychology, for multicultural psychology to attend to American Jews. Well, there's a few reasons that I believe- 

00:08:05
Why has it taken so long? Being Jewish is often an invisible minority status Contributions of the Shoah and internalized antisemitism Christian Privilege (Schlosser, 2003) and the assumptions of Christianity as normoative in the United States Substantial within-group variability of Jews 

00:08:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - and the first is that being Jewish, like other cultural minority statuses is often invisible, despite stereotypic assumptions about what a Jew looks like. You cannot look at a Jew and know someone is a Jew. Uhm, and part of that has also comes from Jews, because after the Shoah, which was the Holocaust, a lot of Jews hid their Jewish identity. They didn't want to be identified as Jews, because they wanted to be safe. And so, they assimilated, because Jew, ah, American Jews who are largely Ashkenazi, which I will talk about in a minute, have white skin, so they were able to pass as White and non-Jewish. So one, one reason we haven't talked about Jews is 'coz the Jews have hidden to some degree for safety and because Jews are not, not sort of in your face, because again it's an invisible minority status. Another reason is because of Christian privilege. Now, Christian privilege is something I've talked about previously and written about. Essentially means that Christians in our country enjoyed benefits that people from other religious groups do not. And what goes along with Christian privilege in the United States is that pretty much people assume that Christianity is the norm. So, if you're not Christian, they sort of, furrow their brow and wonder, well, what kind of devil worshipper are you? Uhm, do you know you're going to hell? Things of that sort. But if we have assumptions that uhm, Christianity is the norm in the United States, then we don't have to attend to Jews, or Muslims or any other religious minority group for that matter. And finally, the third reason, why I think we haven't attended to American Jews, is because there's a substantial within group variability, within the group that we call American Jews. And I'm gonna talk about that variability in a minute. But there is no one way to capture ah, the diversity of this group, because there are so many different denominations of American Jews, uhm, and Jews in general come from almost every country on the Earth. And so, and they also have very, vary on their uhm, adherence to religion, religiosity and the Torah. And so for all these reasons, Jews are so complicated. I think as psychologists, when we can't fit something into our neat little box, we throw up our hands and say, let's try something else. So, I think these are the reasons why we haven't attended to American Jews previously. Okay. So now, I'm gonna move forward- 

00:10:25
Introduction to Jews and Jewish Culture 

00:10:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - and the, in the next section, I'm gonna talk to a little bit about who are Jews and give you a little bit of an introduction to Jewish culture. Okay. So, what is Judaism? Well for those of you that don't know- 

00:10:35
What is Judaism? Judaism is a culture, a religion, an ethnicity, and a set of traditions that is embedded in Jewish people's expectations, belief systems, and family dynamics Jews can not be easily nor accurately described in the current demographic taxonomies, as they confound the established notions of race, ethnicity, and religion Seeing Judaism only as a religion is overly simplistic and fails to describe the diversity of Jews adequately (e.g., American Jews are assumed to be White) 

00:10:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - Judai, Judaism is a culture, it's a religion, it's an ethnicity and it's a set of traditions that is embedded in Jewish peoples expectations, belief systems and family dynamics. For people who say Judaism is just a religion, it often fails to capture uhm, the very strong secular identity that ah, is very important for many American Jews. Uhm, in addition, as I alluded to previously, Jews cannot easily, nor accurately be described by our current demographic taxonomies. Because the Jews tend to consent, con, confound our established notions of race, ethnicity and religion. Okay. And lastly, of course, seeing Judaism as solely religion is, is simplistic for one, but it also fails to describe the diversity of Jews adequately. For example, Jews are assumed to be all White, which is just quite frankly not the case, and I'll get more to that in a minute. Okay. So as I noted before, there's a lot of within group variability- 

00:11:35
What is a Jew? There is tremendous within-group variability among American Jews. There are many ways to: Be Jewish Express one's Jewish identity Identify oneself culturally and ethnically Practice cultural customs and observe holidays American Jews often feel bicultural, providing them with 2 different lenses from which to view the world (Friedman et al., 2005) 

00:11:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - among the group we call American Jews. Uhm, just so you know, there are many ways to be Jewish. There are many ways to express your Jewish identity, there are many ways to identi, identify yourself both culturally and ethnically, as well as, at the degree to which you practice cultural customs and observe holidays. Recent research, which I think is fairly accurate even though it was only a qualitative study, so it had a, a, a small sample, found that American Jews tended to feel bicultural, that they were able to view the lens through, view the world through ah, two different lenses. Sometimes they viewed it through their lens as an American, and sometimes they view it through their lens as a Jew. But invariably, they talked about looking at most situations in their life and considering both lenses before making a decision. Okay. Uhm, this, the next slide is about ah, the three different categories of American Jews. And these comes from, these three categories of Jews, these comes more from social science, even sociology, more, ah, moreso than psychology, ah, 'coz they've actually done more work in the area of Jewish issues. The first, there are people who are Jewish descent- 

00:12:40
Three categories of Jews People who are of Jewish descent and practice Judaism to some degree People of Jewish descent who do not practice Judaism, yet define themselves as cultural or secular Jews People who have converted to Judaism 

00:12:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - and practice Judaism to some degree. Uhm, then you also have a group of people who may be of Jewish descent, but don't practice Judaism. But they still would define themselves as cultular, cultural or secular Jews. You may encounter a number of these people. They are a fairly large group in the United States. People who may not go to temple or to a synagogue yet, if you asked them who, who they are or something about their cultural identity, they'll say, "I'm a Jew." Uhm, and then of course, the third category, would be people who are, who converted to Judaism. So, people who are not born to Jewish parents or born from a Jewish family, but converted at some point in their life. Okay. Let me give you some Jewish population statistics so, you'll have a sense of who this group is. As I told you that we're roughly two, Jews ah, comprise roughly two percent of the United States population. While in terms- 

00:13:30
Jewish Population Statistics Recent estimates range between 13 and 18 million Jews worldwide Of those, roughly 7 million Jews live in the U.S. U.S. total population 300 million 1/3 of American Jews live in large urban centers on the East and West coasts, and in Chicago The three cities with the largest Jewish populations in the world are New York, Miami, and Los Angeles 

00:13:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - of the worldwide, the population estimates range anywhere from 13 to 18 million. Okay. And of those 13 to 18 million, roughly seven million Jews live in the United States. Okay. And again, just to give you that, "How did I arrive at that nearly two percent?" The U.S. total population is somewhere around 300 million. Okay. So, I give you some comparison sake. So, of course, we're here in the northeast corridor where Jews are certainly over-represented. Jews tend to live in cities, ah, that was, you see on the bottom here, Jews, the three largest Jewish populations are in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. Ah, and we live with close proximities in New York. People say, "Oh well, there's tons of Jews everywhere I go." In the New York area, there certainly are more Jews, but again, there's only seven million Jews in the entire United States roughly. And about third of those live in large urban centers, ah, mostly on the East and West coast, as well as, Chicago, right there in the middle. Okay. So now I'll talk to you a little bit about the diversity of Jewish heritage. And before I begin, just note that I'm gonna highlight the, the major uhm, the major heritages for Jews although there are certainly many others. Uhm, the most- 

00:14:40
The Diversity of Jewish Heritage Ashkenazim: Jews who trace their historical lineage to or currently live in Eastern Europe Sephardim: Jews who trace their historical lineage to or currently live in Spain or Portugal Mizrachim: Jews who trace their historical lineage to or currently live in Northern Africa and/or Western Asia 

00:14:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - common that you'll find in the United States are the Ashkenazim. And the Ashkenazim are Jews who trace their historical lineage to or current live, currently live in Eastern Europe. And people who are Ashkenazim or Ashkenazi tend to have white skin because they're from Eastern Europe. Then you have the Sephardim these are Jews who trace their historical lineage to or currently live in Spain or Portugal. Uhm, and then finally, you have the Mizrachim, these are Jews who trace their historical lineage to or currently live in Northern Africa and/or Western Asia. 

00:15:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER To give you an example of another one, there's a group called the Italkim, these are Jews who are from Italy ah, but obviously it's a much smaller group than the Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Mizrachim. In the United States, these are the three largest, uhm, groups of Jews that you're gonna find. Jews from one of these three backgrounds, in terms of their ethnic or, uhm, excuse me not ethnic, their country of origin by history. Okay. So now, let me talk- 

00:15:40
The Diversity of Jewish Denominations 

00:15:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - a little bit about the, the denominations. Okay. And here again, I'm gonna only cover the most common or most well-known denominations or movements of Judaism in the United States. And I'm gonna cover- 

00:15:50
A few notes, first Five most common denominations/movements of Judaism in the United States There are always exceptions (i.e., Jews who will not fit the mold of the particular denomination to which they identify) Presented from most conservative/traditional to most liberal/radical in terms of their values and adherence to Jewish Orthodoxy American Jews of all denominations, including secular ones, can have a very strong cultural identity 

00:15:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - five of them today. Ah, and little thing I want you to remember is, there are always gonna be exceptions, uhm, that's the fun part about Jews, the way we are, we, if there's a, if there's a mold, you will find some Jews who wanted not fit in that mold. And perhaps, we're no different from any other group in that way. And I'm gonna present these groups to you in order from most conservative or traditional to most liberal or radical in terms of their values and in terms of their adherence to Jewish Orthodoxy. Okay. But I, I also want you to remember before I move forward that American Jews of all denominations, any of the ones I'm about to describe, including secular Jews, can have a very strong cultural identity as Jews. Okay. So the first are the- 

00:16:30
Hasidic Jews Yiddish is first language, followed by Hebrew and then English Men wear black coats, pants, hats, and have peyos Women wear very modest clothing (e.g., long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow) Strict adherence to the Orthodox lifestyle Keeping kosher Observing the Sabbath Following the laws of family purity (which address sexual relations and ritual cleanliness) 

00:16:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - Hasidic Jews. Hasidic Jews, uh, speak Yiddish as their first language then they learn Hebrew and then they learned English. Okay. And some Hasidic Jews don't speak English at all. Some Hasidic Jews don't interact with the outside world at all. They tend to live in a close-knit communities, self-contained communities. The men are readily identifiable. They wear black coats, they wear pants, hat and they have peyos, which are the side curls you see coming alo, coming down over their ears. The women wear very modest clothing. They wear long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow. You'll never see them wear sleeveless shirts or short skirts uhm, because they don't believe in that. And they have a strict adherence to what we will call the Orthodox lifestyle. They keep kosher, they observe the Sabbath and they follow the laws of family purity, which address both sexual relations and ritual cleanliness. And kosher, for those of you who don't know, is that, Hasidic Jew, Jews who keep kosher don't mix milk and meat, they don't eat shellfish, and don't eat pork. Okay. So, more about the Hasidic Jews,- 

00:17:35
Hasidic Jews II Immersed in Jewish life and tradition Popular and secular culture are avoided This is why these Jews live in self-contained communities Torah is seen as literal translation of G-d's law Thus, these Jews resist modernity and the associated changes in society 

00:17:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - they're immersed in Jewish life and tradition. To be a Jewish scholar is perhaps the, one of the most honored positions in the community, to be a Rabbi, to be ah, an educated person, but educated in, in Jewish tradition. Uhm, they tend to avoid popular and secular culture, which is why you'll find that Hasidic Jews tend to live in self-contained communities. Perhaps the, the most well-known ones are the communities in Brooklyn, New York. Uhm, and another important thing is that, these Jews see the Torah as a literal translation of God's law. Okay. They believe that the Torah that we have, this is what God wants, and because of this, they resist modernity and the associated changes in society. So, ah, in the Hasidic culture, ah, women are clearly a second-class citizens. Uhm they don't count towards an Alia, an Alia being, "You need ten people, you need ten people if you wanna read the Torah," that's what they will call an Alia. Women don't count toward an Alia in Hasidic community but this is part of again, they redi, they resist modernity, they don't want to adapt. And so because of that, there are sometimes negative perceptions about them from non-Hasidic, from non-Hasidic Jews, as well as, non-Jewish, in general because their views of the treatment of women. Okay. Your next group- 

00:18:55
Orthodox Jews Dress like other people in the U.S. Men wear Yarmulkes Women wear modest clothing Secular learning and culture are part of their lives However, they believe that the Torah is the word of G-d Religious services are entirely in Hebrew Men and women sit separately Adhere to the 3 elements of Orthodox lifestyle 

00:18:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - is your Orthodox Jews. Okay. The Orthodox Jews dress like other people in the United States. You probably see them on the train or the subway or walking on the streets. Ah, the men tend to wear Yarmulkes and women wear more modest clothing. However, Orthodox Jews have both secular learning and culture as a part of their lives. So, although they still believe that the Torah is the word of God, uhm, they're involved in the secular world, they have jobs and they do things that anybody else does but they just follow the, they adhere to the three elements of the Orthodox lifestyle, they keep kosher, they observe the Sabbath, men and women still sit separately in temple and religious services are completely in Hebrew for Orthodox Jews. There's no English in the services. And you'll see as I go on, there's, how that compares to the other groups where Hebrew and English are combined in the other services. Okay. So, the next group we'll talk about is Reform Jews. And, Reform Jews are actually the largest group in the United States. If you, if, if you encounter a Jew in the United States, you're likely to encounter a Reform Jew who is of Ashkenazi descent. Okay. Reform- 

00:20:05
Reform Jews Developed during the Enlightenment to modernize Judaism and as a reaction to Orthodoxy Men and women sit together in religious services, which are in Hebrew and English See Judaism as an evolving entity, where individual conscience and informed choice guides decisions, not just the Torah Most, but not all, reform Jews do not adhere to the three elements of Orthodox lifestyle First denomination to ordain women as Rabbis 

00:20:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Judaism was developed during the Enlightenment period in Europe to moderne, to modernize Judaism and kind of as a reaction to Orthodoxy. Uhm, Jews at that time were sort of feeling like Orthodoxy, it was strict and it was oppressive. And during that Enlightenment period, people said, "We wanna make a change." So, men and women were allowed to sit together, ah, in the religious services, and as you see, religious services are both in Hebrew and in English in this, in their services. And Reform Jews see Judaism as kind of an evolving entity, uhm, and individual conscience and informed choice helps guide decisions, not just the Torah. So, Reform Jews really differ from Orthodox Jews and Hasidic Jews in that they don't see the Torah as a, you know, they don't literally interpret it as God's law. And most Reform Jews do not adhere to the three elements of the Orthodox lifestyle. Most Reform Jews do not keep kosher, although some do, and most Reform Jews do not observe the Sabbath. By the way for, I realize I didn't explain observing the Sabbath. There are Jews who ah, observe the Sabbath will not work, ah, from sundown Friday night until sundown Saturday night. Ah, they won't drive cars, they will go to temple, ah, they won't cook, there are a lot of things that they will not do because it is, to them the day of rest. That's why it's called the Sabbath. Most Reform Jews do not ah, observe the Sabbath in this way. They may go to temple on Friday or Saturday uhm, but again they may drive there and they may do, do other things afterwards. Uhm, it's also important to note that Reform Judaism was the first denomination to ordain women as Rabbis. Uhm, (coughs) excuse me. Then we have conservative Jews. Now, conservative Jews, and you can also now, sense this sort of a, a how, how the religion has developed over time. So, you have Reform developing as a reaction to Orthodoxy and now, we have conservative Jews kinda created as a response- 

00:21:55
Conservative Jews Created as a response to Reform Judaism Adherence to Hebrew in religious services, but men and women sit together More likely to keep kosher and observe the Sabbath than Reform Jews Have a positive attitude toward and involvement with modern, secular culture Non-fundamentalist teaching of Judaism 

00:21:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - to Reform Judaism. So, there were probably a group of Jews who said, "You know, I think maybe they went too far to the side. I don't really ad, I don't believe in the Orthodoxy but I also don't believe in the Reform." And so, you'll find Conservative Jews kind of in the middle there, in between the Orthodox lifestyle and the Reform lifestyle, if you thought about Judaism, kinda on a continuum, with Orthodox over here and Reform over here, you'd find Conservative right there in the middle. Uhm, so in, in the Conservative synagogue, the services are in Hebrew but men and women are allowed to sit together. Ah, conservative Jews are much more likely to keep kosher and observe the Sabbath than Reform Jews, although it is not a, a requirement of Conservative Judaism. Uhm, and they have a positive attitude toward and involvement with modern, secular culture. Ah, and they also adhere to a non-fundamentalist teaching of Judaism. So, Conservative Jews actually, some have said that they are very much like Reform Jews, except they have adopted some of the ah, they've tried to adopt some of the Orthodox practice when it comes to temple. So, they wanna have more Hebrew in the service and they wanna, and actually I don't believe that they have ah, female Rabbis either. So, again, but they're sort of on the, on the continuum, they're sort of the middle of the road folks. So that the label conservative in our current society is probably misleading, uhm, given what people think about, when they think about who, what is a conservative. Ah, and the last one that I'm gonna talk, the last ah, denomination I'll talk about this morning are- 

00:23:25
Only denomination to begin in the U.S. Sees Judaism as an evolving tradition, with 3 elements: G-d, Torah, and the People of Israel Rituals are traditional, but ideology is very progressive For example, one's personal autonomy should override traditional Jewish law First denomination to hold a Bat Mitzvah ceremony for Jewish girls and second denomination to ordain women as Rabbis 

00:23:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Reconstructionist Jews. This is actually the only denomination that has begun in the United States. The others all, all have started ah, in Europe or Asia. Uhm, the Reconstructionist Jews see Judaism as an evolving tradition and there are three elements to this tradition: God, the Torah and the People of Israel. So, the, the Reconstructionist Jews have, have very uhm, progressive ideology, very liberal values but their rituals are very traditional. So, they do a lot of service in Hebrew, uhm, however, they feel that your, your personal autonomy should override traditional Jewish law again, so this, they have that progressive ideology, yet they wanna have some as, some old world aspects of Jewish tradition. Ah, Reconstructionist Jews were the first denomination to hold a Bat Mitzvah ceremony for Jewish girls and the second to ordain women as Rabbis. Now, Bat Mitzvah is a ceremony which is ah, a take-off if you will. It originally called the Bar Mitzvah, it usually happens at age 12 or 13, it's a ceremony when a young Jewish boy is seen as a Jewish man in the eyes of his community, he's called to, to read the Torah for the first time. And as you see, Reconstructionist Jews were the first to hold Bat Mitzvahs, Conservative and Reform Jews all, also hold Bat Mitzvah now for their ah, female members. However, you will not see this in the Orthodox and Hasidic communities, still. Okay. So, let me talk to you a little bit now, ah, now that I've covered the diversity as you see, there's a lot of different ways to be Jewish, let's talk a little bit about the- 

00:24:50
American Jewish Values 

00:24:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - values that Jews hold. And what I'm gonna try to do is hit some of the values that cut across these different denominations of American Jews and they cut across of it because a lot of it comes from the religious, the religious and historical ah, origins of Judaism. Okay. So, some of the values that I think are consistent for American Jews uhm,- 

00:25:15
American Jewish Values The importance of life Freedom for all people Balancing the rights of humans, animals, and the Earth Human action to repair the world The concept of Tikkun Olam (literally, "to heal the world") explains why Jews perform good deeds (mitzvot), donate to and/or work with charitable organizations (tzedakah), and value peace and social justice. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - one is that the Jews value the importance of life and it shouldn't be misconstrued as a pro-life or pro-choice argument. Ah, the importance of life is that they value life first, that for human beings who are alive, it's important for them to live and they should be able to live. They also believe in freedom for all people. Okay. But along with that is that human beings should, should not have complete sovereignty over the Earth. And so humans need to balance their rights with the Earth itself and with animals. So, it's not that the Earth is here for us to do what we want with them and animals are here for us to do what we want with them. So essentially, Jews tried to live in harmony with the environment and with the other creatures, who live on this Earth. In addition, ah, Jews are called to what we would call "Tikkun Olam," which literally means "to heal the world." Uhm, and this, this concept of Tikkun Olam explains why Jews perform good deeds and good deeds are called "mitzvot." Uhm, they often, Jews also either donate or work with charitable organizations, which is called tzedakah, and they value peace and social justice. Uhm, it's no surprise that you will find lots of Jews in the field of Psychology, in the fields of social work, in, in fields where social justice is an important value. Jews are often drawn to these kinds of, ah, careers because they are taught from a young age that this is an important thing to do. Uhm, another important value, and I think one that's very, very important to remember is that- 

00:26:45
American Jewish Values II Justice is a core value for Jews In comparison, forgiveness is a core Christian value Most American Jews appreciate insight, introspection, and intellectual discussion Valuing debate has contributed to substantial variability among American Jews on certain moral issues (e.g., homosexuality, abortion) Others include educational achievement, the centrality of the family, and maintaining traditions 

00:26:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - one of the core values for Judaism, certainly been(ph) the one that I just talked about is justice. Okay. And the reason I, I highlight this is because of many people will tell you that the United States, you may have heard of this something called Judeo-Christian values or Judeo-Christian country. And let me be the first to dispel that myth for you. All right? There is no such thing as a Judeo-Christian country or Judeo-Christian values, right? Jews and Christians have common origins. However, their values are quite different and I'm just as an, you can see for comparison's sake on the slides. A core value for Christianity is forgiveness, whereas the core value for Judaism is justice. And those are highly different. I'm not saying that Christians don't value justice nor am I saying that Jews don't value forgiveness. But it's what these groups believe as the sort of, co, one of the core tenets of what it means to be a Jew or what it means to be a Christian that help say that, these groups are not so similar. Okay. Other values that are important to American Jews. Most American Jews appreciate insight. They apprecia, they appreciate introspection and they appreciate intellectual discussion. And I'm gonna talk about this a little bit, a little bit later when we talk about psychotherapy, because if you're doing psychotherapy with an American Jew, it's important to know that a lot of them may value insight or they may might value introspection, and certainly that they value intellectual discussion because if you're a therapist and your client wants to have a discussion with you, you don't wanna misinterpret that as some sort of ah, you know, defensiveness. This is just perhaps who they are. They wanna talk it through. They wanna talk it out because they value it. They think it's an important component of their daily life. Uhm, of course, the other thing that is important to note is that, because there's this value on debate, uhm, you're gonna find a lot of variability among American Jews on what we would call the moral issues that tend to divide our country, like homosexuality and abortion. So, there I don't believe there is a really clear picture from the American Jewish community on these issues. Although, you can, you can guess that the Orthodox Jews again and the Hasidic Jews find themselves over here on one end of the spectrum. I'm gonna be much more likely to condemn homosexuality and be more likely to be pro-life. And your Reconstructionists Jews and your Reform Jews over here are much gonna be, much more likely to be accepting of homosexuality and be pro-choice. And then, of course you get your Conservative folks here in the middle and they're gonna fall sort of an, depending, you know, they may kinda fall on either side depending upon personal ah, experiences. Uhm, some other values that's important to note uhm, educational achievement is important to American Jews, the centrality of the family, as well as, maintaining traditions. So, these are all things that American Jews tend to do, uhm, as for their values. Okay. Now, again I'm also trying to- 

00:29:30
Issues Faced by All American Jews 

00:29:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - pick up the things that, although I talked about the diversity of Jews, things that cut across for all Jews. I'm gonna talk briefly about some things that all American Jews have to deal with. And the first I've, I've touched on already a little bit, which is antisemitism. So- 

00:29:45
Antisemitism is "hostility toward Jews that can manifest on an individual, institutional, or societal level" (Schlosser & MacDonald-Dennis, 2006) Has been documented for over 4000 years and comes in many forms (e.g., stereotypes, oppression, discrimination, segregation, pogroms, and genocide). Learning about antisemitic events can be traumatizing, even if not experienced first-hand 

00:29:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - antisemitism, your, your textbook definition ah, is that is, is hostility toward Jews that can manifest on an individual, institutional, or a societal level. Okay. And for people who, you know, who need a lesson in history, antisemitism has been documented for over 4,000 years and that's a long time. And it comes in a lot of different forms, you know, stereotypes, oppression, discrimination, segregation, pogroms, genocide, the whole gamut. Uhm, and it's also important I think, like with many other members of other cultural groups, learning about antisemitic events can be traumatizing even if you don't experience it first-hand. So, you know, I can ask those of you in the audience, those of you who're gonna be watching this video, think about, you open a newspaper and you find out that a member of your group was attacked, murdered, ah, ah, assaulted, simply because of their membership in your group. That can be a hurtful experience. I know when I open the paper and I hear about a synagogue being, uhm, being graffitied in Ohio, even though I, you know, live far away, it still bothers me. And so, these kinds of events can bother ah, I don't think this is particular to Jews but that's, so you don't have to experience an event yourself to have experience some trauma related to it if it's against a group with which you strongly identify. Okay. So let me tell you, give you a little bit of ah, sort of brief ah, lecture on antisemitism. Ah, I will be brief I promise. 

00:31:15
Christian ideology Deicide myth Blood libel myth 2nd Testament's depiction of Judaism Jews seen as rich, pushy, stingy and secretive Violence against Jews and Jewish communities Jews are plotting to take over the world Jews control the banks, media and Hollywood 

00:31:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Uhm, cla, there's sort of two kinds of antisematism. One will be Classical Antisematism and the other is what we would call Modern Antisematism. So Classical antisemitism is things that people think ah, I guess sort of been around for a long time. The first of course is Christian ideology that antisemitism was actually written into the Second Testament ah, which includes the Deicide myth which is the myth that, ah, ah, the Jews killed Christ. When it's a historical fact that the Romans did. Ah, there was also a myth called the Blood Libel myth which perpetuated by Christians in the early, the early years, I can't remember the exact years, where Jews were thought to steal Christian children because they wanted to bleed them and use their blood for religious services. Ah, and finally, just in general, the Second Testament's depiction of Judaism, ah, up until the 1960s with Vatican II, ah, many Christians and Catholics thought that the Second Testament, which I call the Second Testament instead of the New Testament, I do that on purpose because Old and New Testaments suggest that new takes the place of the old, and that was of course the whole point is that the, that back then the depiction of Judaism was that Christianity, uhm, superceded Judaism. That Judaism only went so far and that you needed the Second Testament to kinda complete the story. Uhm, so, of course, in, in, in the '60s, when the Pope said that the Jew's covenant with God is still valid and that Jews have a right to exist, uhm, that's when you started to see a change in Christian ideology. Although, those of you who followed current events noticed that the new Pope has actually taken us ah, a couple of steps back in that arena. Uhm, other, other examples of Classical Antisemitism, the classic stereotypes of the Jews are seen as rich, are seen as pushy, stingy, secretive, ah, were plotting to take over the world, in case you didn't know. Uhm, and as, obviously violence against Jews in Jewish communities is unfortunately been around for a long time. And other stereotypes include that Jews control the banks, media and Hollywood. Now, any of you ever heard me speak, you'll have already heard this joke, but if the Jews truly control Hollywood, then Mel Gibson will never work another day in his life. Okay. So let's talk about Modern Antisemitism now. So that was Classic ant, Classical anti-Semitism. Modern antisemitism are the, the ways in which antisemitism manifests itself- 

00:33:40
Modern Antisemitism Labeling Israel as an apartheid state with no claim to Palestine Denying the occurrence of the Shoah Asserting that Jews are overrepresented in academia Indicating that Jews are not a minority and do not deserve minority protections Questioning the Jewish identity of secular Jews Violence against Jews and Jewish communities 

00:33:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - more recently. Uhm, first of course would be labeling Israel as an apartheid state with no claim to Palestine. Ah, other examples include denying the occurrence of the Shoah. Some of you may know only in the last year or two, I believe, in Iran, there was a conference of Holocaust deniers. Ah, other examples include asserting Jews are overrepresented in academia, ah, indicating that Jews are not a minority and they don't deserve minority protections because again, because the stereotypical assumption, all Jews are rich White people. Uhm, in addition, questioning the Jewish identity of secular Jews. A friend of mine, Rachel Navarro, told me this is called legitimacy testing. So, when you have someone who has a strong secular identity, and let's say they're having a bacon cheeseburger. Okay. Bacon cheeseburger if you, if you kept kosher would be a double bad, right? 'Coz it has the bacon which is pork and it has cheese in the burger so it's mixing milk and meat. So it's clearly not a kosher meal. However, there are plenty of secular Jews who might not keep kosher, who feel quite comfortable eating a bacon cheeseburger. Uhm, but to say to that person, "Oh, but you're a Jew. How can you do that? You, you're not really Jewish if you don't follow these rules." That would what we call legitimacy testing. And I would believe that's, that is patently antisemitic. And sadly, of course violence against Jews and Jewish communities has continued today, as I'd explain to you earlier in this talk. Okay. Another event that even though it happened 60 years ago, still affects all American Jews is the Shoah. 

00:35:05
The Shoah The defining historical event for modern antisemitism Systematic murder of 6 million Jews by Nazis 65% of the Jews in Europe 35% of the Jews worldwide Created a belief in some that Jews were worthy of being annihilated, which perpetuates antisemitism Because of the Shoah and their long history of being oppressed, many Jews attempted to pass on non-Jews 

00:35:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER  And this is the defining historical event for modern antisemitism. The Shoah represents a systematic murder and extinction of six, roughly six million Jews by the Nazis in the night, late 1930s and early 1940s. And the, the figures are kinda staggering because these six million Jews represented 65 percent of the Jews in Europe, ah, and 35 percent of the Jews worldwide. So again, basically, if you think about it, that's one out of every three Jews worldwide was killed. Uhm, the lingering effects of the Shoah have been equally troublesome because the Shoah has created a belief in some people that the Jews were worthy of being annihilated. And I believe this perpetuates antisemitism. Uhm, and as I, I I, think I may have alluded to earlier, because of the Shoah, and because of their long history of being oppressed, a lot of Jews have simply attempted to pass as non-Jews. They don't identify themselves as Jews. I have a friend who, ah, a scholar, Dan Rosen(ph) who says, "What's the, what's the question you can ask a Jew that will make him or her most anxious? Are you Jewish?" Because the Jew at that time has to consider the effects of disclosing themselves and the safety of the environment and a, a number of other factors which I'll talk about when we talk about psychotherapy. Okay? Of course, anyone who has passed for whatever reason- 

00:36:30
The Shoah II Assimilating afforded survival to many Jews, but the personal and cultural costs were steep Losing their Jewish culture Denying their identity For some Jews, the history of oppression, culminating in the Shoah, led to the development of internalized antisemitism 

00:36:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - knows that assimilating may so afford you some survival but you're gonna(ph), you're gonna pay some personal and cultural costs. Right? And for Jews, this meant losing part of your culture and denying a part of who you are, uhm, and this is, can be very painful. And for some people, ah, aspects of the history that they denied and, and didn't keep may be lost forever. And for some Jews unfortunately, the history of oppression and the Shoah led to the development of what we would call internalized antisemitism, which I'll talk about now. Internalized antisemitism is when, when a Jew, and again we're talking about American Jews today, kinda takes on uhm, the subtle or not so subtle antisem, antisemitic messages that persist in our society. And what it does- 

00:37:15
Internalized Antisemitism Ambivalent and/or negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about one's identity as a Jew Feelings range from confusion to discomfort and embarrassment to self-hatred Behavioral manifestations include Disinterest in Jewish heritage and life Moving away from or denying one's own Jewish identity Disparaging other practicing Jew 

00:37:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - is it creates ambivalent or negative thoughts, feelings or behaviors about their identity as a Jew. Okay? And feelings can range anywhere from confusion or discomfort, that they could be embarrassed about being Jewish. They could even have self-hatred, if it's very serious internalized antisemitism. Ah, behaviorally speaking, this could look a lot of different ways. You could have someone who's disinterested in Jewish heritage, in Jewish life. They might move away from or even completely deny their own Jewish identity. They may actually disparage other practicing Jews. They might make jokes about Jews in a negative way. So, internalized antisemitism is, is ah, my understanding of it and my belief- 

00:37:55
Internalized Antisemitism II Most, if not all, American Jews go through the process of learning and hopefully unlearning internalized antisemitism by being raised and/or living in an antisemitic society This process, as well as the concomitant feelings and behaviors, may be similar to what people from other minority groups experience vis-a vis interacting with the dominant culture group (see Helms & Cook, 1999). 

00:37:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - of it is that it's a similar process that people of color go through by being the people of color who were raised in the United States that the so, society is inherently racist and so they have to unlearn a lot of these messages. And I think for Jews brought up in this country there's a similar unlearning process that has to go on. Uhm, in this case, it's unlearning about antisemitism as opposed to racism. Okay? Ah, okay, so that's what I just said. In addition, another issue that faces Jews, which I've touched on- 

00:38:25
The Invisibility of Judaism Jewish identity is typically invisible Especially for Conversative, Reform, Reconstructionist and Secular Jews The issue of identifying oneself as Jewish to others becomes one where safety must first be assessed Most Jews do not feel as comfortable marking themselves as Jews in the way that Christians do by wearing a cross or crucufix 

00:38:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - a little bit previously, is this issue of Invisibility. As I said that Jewish identity tends to be invisible. I am, in fact, a Jew but if you looked at me, I, you wouldn't know I was Jewish unless of course you made assumptions about me because of phenotypic characteristics about myself. Okay? And it's, Jewish identity is definitely invisible or it's very invisible for secular Jews, for Reform Jews, Reconstructionist Jews and most Conservative Jews. Right? It's a little bit more visible for your Orthodox Jews and certainly visible for your Hasidic Jews because then they're wearing clear visible markers of their Jewish identity. Uhm, if you've ever walked around and seen a gentleman with little, you've seen little strings maybe coming out of their shirt if you didn't know what that was that they were actually wearing a tallis underneath their shirt, uhm, and it's again a, a way to visibly identify oneself as a Jew. I mean they're not, they're not wearing it to identify themselves but you can clearly see that this person is wearing a tallis so they're clearly Jewish or again for men wearing a yarmulke is probably the easiest sign to know. Uhm, but as I, as I alluded to you before, you know, the issue of identifying yourself as a Jew is one where you have to really assess your safety. Uhm, engage in this little social science experiment with me, wherever you are, those of you who gonna watch this video, walk around your town, get on your bus, ride your subway, and just count the number of people wearing Jewish stars, and then I want you to count the number of people wearing crosses or crucifixes and just add 'em up. I'm pretty sure that you're gonna find a lot more people wearing crucifixes than there are people wearing Jewish stars. Because people feel quite comfortable wearing, wearing their cross as a expression of their faith and who they are but a lot of Jews don't because the safety issues are there. And I'm, I'm not talking about the rappers who wear like the big, you know, huge gold crosses, I'm talking about people who are doing it 'coz it, it means something to them. In addition, another thing that affects all American Jews is this thing, this issue- 

00:40:20
Christian Privilege The U.S. is a secular, yet predominantly Christian country Christians are the clear numerical majority, representing anywhere from 75% to 90% of the U.S. population Assumptions of Christian universality lead people to believe that religion is not a salient cultural variable or that religious diversity is non-existent 

00:40:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - called Christian Privilege as I touched on previously. We live in a ah, supposedly secular but predominantly Christian country. Uhm, but Christians are the clear, numerical mino, majority. Ah, depending upon whose statistics you use, they represent anywhere from 75 to 90 percent of the U.S. population. Okay? And for argument's sake, I have combined the different Christian groups together 'coz a lot of Christians when they talk to me say, "Well, my group of Christianity only comprises ten percent of the population or 20 percent of the population." Uhm, but there are core aspects of Christianity, including the belief in Jesus Christ certainly is, is one of them, that cut across all Christian groups. Okay? And when Christians say to me, "Well we're not, we're not in-charge, we don't have the power." It's pretty similar to when a white person says, "So I'm not in-charge, I don't have the power." Uhm, you know how many non-White Anglo-Saxon Protestant presidents have we had in our history, you all know the answer I suppose. The answer is one and they killed him, right, he was Catholic, never had a Jew. So, Christianity goes hand-in-hand with people with white skin and men of being in the positions of power in our country. And as I said before, earlier in the talk, these assumptions of Christian universality that were all Christian, lead people to think that religion is just not a salient cultural variable, and that religious diversity, which doesn't exist, is probably a handful of Jews that probably in New York, uhm, and they just don't consider that as an important variable. Uhm, okay. So now we're gonna get to the final section which is talking about Conducting Affirmative Psychotherapy with American Jews. And, so I'm gonna talk about a bunch of different areas ah, and I'm trying to highlight the, the differences that all occur for Jewish therapist versus the Non-Jewish therapist because the issues will be different for the different clinicians. So, for Jewish therapists, there's a Self-Awareness Process- 

00:42:20
Self-Awareness for Jewish Therapists Engage in self-assessment regarding biases toward and beliefs about Jews Don't assume Jewish clients share your perceptions of Judaism or Jewish identity Examine the potential impact that internalized antisemitism may have on clinical work Impaired empathy toward Jewish clients Consider effects of (non) disclosure of Jewish identity 

00:42:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - that really has to happen. Ah, and so, the first step is en, engaging in a self-assessment about their own biases and beliefs about Jews. And these of course would, most likely, ah, center around, well this is for Jewish therapists. Well, I believe this about Judaism, so we need to understand what, what other Jews believe, Jews who aren't from my denomination. Uhm, like for example, I'm a Reformed Jew, but what are my biases about working with an Orthodox Jew or Hasidic Jew. Right? So, I would have to engage in a self-assessment process to try to make sure that my biases don't come out and negatively impact my ability to treat this client. And, of course, at the same time, I can assume that, let's say another Reformed Ashkenazi, you know, male Jew walks in the room, I, I can't think that just 'coz he and I share several aspects of cultural identity in common that he's gonna see Judaism the same way, that it's gonna have the same degree of importance to him or it's gonna have, he's gonna practice Judaism the way I practice it. So, I can't make assumptions that Jews from my group practice Judaism the same way either. Okay? I also have to, as a Jewish clinician, I have to consider the potential impact that internalized antisemitism I have on my work. Okay. Because if I haven't taken a time to deal with any of the internalized antisemitism, my empathy might be impaired for Jewish clients 'coz I might think, "Oh, I might buy into this," another stereotype is that Jews complain, so if I have a Jew come in and they're complaining about things I might think in my head if I have internalized antisemitism, "Here's another whiny Jew," but really what's going on is I need to ah, deal with the in, internalized antisemitism that's going on within me. In addition, a really tricky issue is the effects of disclosure or non-disclosure of my Jewish identity to my client. Because do I disclose my identity to the client and the client says, "Why are you telling me this?" Uhm, or they might think, "Oh that's good, it makes me feel comfortable," at the same time what if I don't disclose and maybe we have a really good working relationship, and six months into it they've discovered I'm Jewish and feel that I was potentially withholding this from them. So, these issues between therapist, between a Jewish therapist and in this case a Jewish client are important ones for the therapist to think about prior to beginning therapy with a Jewish client. Now, for non-Jewish therapists,- 

00:44:40
Self-Awareness for Non-Jewish Therapists Engage in self-assessment regarding biases toward and beliefs about Jews Learn about Judaism, Jewish culture, and the complex nature of Jewsih identity Don't view Judaism only as a religion If more abjectly negative thoughts or feelings about Jews are held, then refer American Jewish clients out until these feelings have been addressed 

00:44:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - it is equally important to engage in the self-assessment process in terms of: What do I think about Jews? What are my beliefs about Jews? What are my biases? What have been my experiences with Jews? Ah, for non-Jewish therapists, obviously I think it's very important to learn about Judaism, to learn about Jewish culture and as well about the complex nature of Jewish identity. So, certainly watching a video such as this or reading work about Jews will be an important thing to do if you're gonna take, if you are non-Jewish therapist and you're gonna take on a Jewish client and you had no experience working with Jewish clients. Again, it's important don't view Judaism solely as a religion. And then of course, for the non-Jewish therapist, if you are engaging in your self-assessment process and you come to realize that you hold very strongly negative thoughts or feelings, you really have an ethical obligation to refer Jewish clients to another clinician until you can deal with these feelings in a way that you can then treat this person in the way that they deserve to be treated. Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about your clients and their disclosure of Jewish identity. 

00:45:45
Client's Disclosure of Jewish Identity Not all Jews will openly self-identify Safety of environment is assessed before disclosure Historically speaking, Jews have been visibly identified in negative ways Hiding one's Jewish identity has been adaptive Denying one's own Jewishness can lead to social isolation and poor self-image Fear of being "outed" as a Jew Shame for lacking cultural pride 

00:45:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Now, not all Jews are gonna openly self-identify as such. Some of you who work in facilities where they, they will ask clients to identify their religious background or their ethnic background and the person might indicate that their Jewish on one of those sort of intake forms. But a lot of places won't, so you can't, you'll never know, if ah, you'll be sitting across from a Jewish client. Again, you'll never, but you'll often not know if you're sitting across from a Jewish client because of the invisibility factor. Okay? And most Jewish clients are gonna assess the safety of the environment before the disclose. They're gonna test you, they wanna see how you respond, to see if they say something and, and to see if you, your response reflects antisemitism or reflects perhaps, a more positive attitude toward Jews. Okay. And so, that's an important thing to remember as a clinician that if you feel that your client is hesitant or not, you know, they're withholding and not very disclosing, there could be a reason for that. Is that they're assessing the safety of the environment and their assessing you, their sort of trustworthiness in you. Uhm, and, you know, the thing to remember is that historically speaking, Jews have been visibly identified in negative ways none probably more prominent than being tattooed and being forced to wear yellow stars during WWII to identify themselves as Jews. And of course, that had, ah, disastrous consequences because it meant going to concentration camps and that potentially meant being murdered. So, hiding your, your identity as a Jew historically has been quite adaptive. So, your clients who are Jewish may not come out and say, "Well I'm a Jew and, and this part of why I'm here." Okay. And so, the other thing related to client's disclosure you need to remember is that, uhm, for clients who deny their own Jewish identity, they might feel socio, socially isolated. They might have a poor self-image because then they might constantly fear that they gonna be outed as a Jew, uhm, or they might have shame for not being, you know, lacking cultural pride, "Why don't I wear my Jewish star? Why don't I rail against the machine a little more?" Okay. So, clients are gonna assess safety of the environment. Okay? And the first thing that clients are likely to do is they're gonna look to the, ah, just like many people do, I'm gonna look at my past experiences in a similar situation to determine, well, how should I handle this situation? Well, this kinda was like this when I had this and this is how I handled it. So, the first step is that they're gonna review their own experiences and find out, okay did this work the last time? Did it not work? And make a decision accordingly. In addition, they're also gonna look at environmental or contextual factors. Okay. In New York, we live in a very unusual place if you will, when it comes to being Jewish, and personally, as a Jewish, why I love living in New York because I feel very safe in New York. But in other parts of the country that safety is, you know, I can't, you, you'd be taking it for granted, it doesn't exist in a lot of those other, in other parts of the country. So, the Jewish client has to, you know,- 

00:48:45
Assessing Safety Rely on their own past experiences in similar situations to help determine the safety of disclosure Statements from the media and elected officials provide contextual information concerning the prevailing attitudes towards Jews Assess the attitudes of others regarding diversity in general, and Jews in particular white-skinned Ashkenazi Jews may be privy to others' prejudiced (e.g., racist) feelings 

00:48:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - assess the environment, statements from the media, statements from elected officials, ah, the prevalence of anti-Jewish crime in their community, because they wanna get a sense of in, in the environment, in the commune, community where I live, what's the attitude towards Jews in this, in this state? In this city? In this town? In this neighborhood in which I live? Because that's gonna impact the degree to which someone may disclose our Jewish identity. Uhm, in addition, the Jewish client will often assess your, you know, the attitudes of others regarding diversity in general, and Jews, in particular. Because if you're sitting with, ah, you have, you, you're, you're with someone and they feel comfortable if you say we have two White people, let's say we have a, a White Jew and a White non-Jew and the non-Jew feels comfortable in making a racist joke. The Jewish person is gonna say like, "Okay," for, for one he thinks that he doesn't see me as a Jew, he does sees me as a White person feels comfortable in trying to make this racist joke to see if I also too hold this racist beliefs. But in addition, as a Jew, it makes me think, "Okay, well this is what he thinks of, he or she thinks of others. Right? That feeling comfortable to denigrate others in the comp, you know, in, in company. So, this will gonna be an assessment about your attitudes toward diversity in general, in addition to just how, how do you feel about Jews. And, and I think because this, that example I just gave that for white-skinned Ashkenazi Jews, we get privy to other people's prejudice feelings, often their racist feelings because we're seen as for my, like myself, I'm just seen as a White man. So I'm privy to things that because they don't realize I have this other identity and this identification with being a minority, as well as, being in the majority. Okay. Now, for those of you who are clinicians and you're gonna be assessing Jewish clients, when you've identified the client as a Jewish, of course, that would be, that, that's, you know, that's in a point that once a client or a client, actually the client is identified him or herself as Jewish,- 

00:50:30
Assessing Jewish Clients Ask client for permission to explore Jewish identity and provide reasons for said exploration How does it relate to the presenting problems? Communicates an interest in and respect for the client and her or his background by creating safe environment for client self- disclosure Empowers the client to determine the level of discourse regarding Jewish issue 

00:50:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - uhm, I would encourage you to ask your client for permission to explore this Jewish identity and to provide reasons for said exploration. So, if your intensions are, you know, I've never had a Jewish client, I wanna, I wanna learn more about a Jewish client, that's not a good intention because that client is not there to teach you about Jews, the client is there because they have some problems and they need your help. But if you feel that there's a reason that their Jew, that exploring the Jewish identity is gonna help understand the presenting problem then it can be a fruitful area to explore if for example you feel that, let's say they have, ah, an anxiety disorder, or they have a, a PTSD, a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and it's specifically related to the experience of antisemitism then absolutely exploring their Jewish identity would be an appropriate thing to do. By asking permission, I think it, it communicates from, from the clinicians to the client, it communicates an interest in the client, and respect for the client and their background, and, and telling the client, trying to foster this environment where it's, it's safe for them to disclose. So, and also kind of at the same time hopefully you're gonna empower the client to set the level of discourse regarding Jewish issues. So, you're asking for permission to talk about it but you want the client to feel like, you know, I'm gonna set, I'm gonna, I'm gonna talk about what I wanna talk about, but when I feel like I've said enough I'm gonna stop, and the therapist should really respect and sort of try to mirror the client, match where the client is in terms of the level of disclosure regarding these issues. Okay? So, what as clinicians, what should we seek to understand? We- 

00:52:05
Assessing Jewish Clients II Seek to understand the client's: Adherence to the practice of Judaism Relationship with the dominant culture Relationship to other Jews This will determine relevance of Jewish identity to treatment and reduce reliance on assumptions about Jewish identity For most clients, being Jewish will have no bearing on their presenting issues 

00:52:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - should seek to understand how much they practice Judaism. Right? They need to understand the client's relationship with the dominant culture, uhm, and you need to consider this broadly, so, so, what I, what I mean is that, not only do we wanna consider their relationship with Christianity, but if for example, your client is a Jew of color then what's their relationship with White people? If your client is a woman, what's her relationship with men? So, you wanna consider the multiple aspects of identity in addition to their Jewish identity and seeking to understand the client's relationship with sort of dominant group. As well as what's their relationship to other Jews? Now, I also serve, I often consider like kinda their involvement, are they involved with the Jewish community? Do they feel they have ah, again ah, not nes, not, there are plenty of Jews who don't go to temple. And I even know plenty of Jews who only go to temple on the high holidays. My wife and I call them high holiday-Jews. Uhm, and we do, we do it out of fun but, they're still involved with the temple and so that tells you something about the Jew. They feel that there is a connection. There is a place I can go and interact with other Jews, a place where I can feel safe and place where I can go be a Jewish and, and it's okay, and it's accepted. So, as you make these assessments, this is gonna help you determine, you know, how much, if at all, Jewish identity is gonna be relevant to treatment. It will also help you reduce any assumptions about Jewish identity because you'll get a more personalized and individualized picture of the client's own Jewish identity. Because even if a client says, "Oh, well I am a conservative Jew," and you can think, okay, well, I heard Schlosser talk about Conservative Jews. I know what you are now, but it's much better to get it from the client and they can tell you exactly what they do, you know, what's their understanding of Conservative Judaism, what's their practice of it, what's their involvement or relationship with other Jews. And in my own clinical experience for a lot of clients, being Jewish is gonna have no bearing on their presenting issues, for sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. So, we just, we don't wanna make assumptions about people that because they're belong to a specific group that, that their membership in that group is somehow related to the reasons that they ah, sought therapy. Okay. So, how can you establish rapport with your Jewish client? Well, hopefully you're doing it on the way- 

00:54:15
Establishing Rapport Be aware of the history and current status of antisemitism, and negative stereotypes about Jews Provide a safe space for Jewish clients to discuss their experiences of discrimination and antisemitism Communicate to clients that assumptions (i.e., based on client's Jewish identity) do not guide one's therapeutic approach Allow the client to describe how, if at all, being Jewish plays a role in the presenting problem(s) 

00:54:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - with this assessment process. But other ways you can establish rapport is by being aware of the history, as well as, the current status of antisemitism and negative stereotypes about Jews. So, this can be challenging, this is I think sometimes challenging for non-Jewish therapists in the same way it is from, its challenging for me to be aware of the history and current status of racism when I'm working with a Black client, uhm, or sexism, when I'm working with a woman. Because when it's, when it's about oneself, it's easy to keep up on the history and the current status, as when it's about you, you have more interest in it. Or when it's about something it, it okay I'm gonna, I need to learn about this. Not because it's better for me but because it's better for my client. And so, I think that can be a challenge and, and so clinicians really need to push themselves, you know, again not just with Jews but with, with other groups. Being aware of the things that have happened to ah, this group that the client is coming from and, and being able to communicate that to your client can help establish your rapport. In addition, you can provide a safe space for the Jewish client to discuss discrimination or antisemitism again by asking permission to explore Jewish identity, and trying to let them know that this is a place where they can talk about that if they would like to ah, in a, in a way that they won't be judged. Uhm, you can also communicate to your clients that you're not gonna let assumptions guide your approach. And I think that's also a critical thing to remember, uhm, because if you are the kind of person, again who said, "Well, oh, I went, I heard Schlosser speak, so I know what I need to know about Reform Jews." I think, it's really, you wanna really clearly communicate to your client that, okay, I might know something about Jews, but even though I know something I'm still not gonna let that determine what I do. I still wanna listen to the client. I still wanna hear what the client has to say because they, of course, are gonna tell me exactly what I need to know. And again, allow the client to describe how if at all being Jewish plays a role on their presenting problems, 'coz it may, and it may not. And your clients should really be held, be the one who did make those determinations. Okay. Now, you also, as clinicians, need to understand what we will call healthy paranoia. 

00:56:25
Understand Healthy Paranoia Distinguish between clinical paranoia from the presence of a "healthy paranoia" in American Jews Status as numerical minority Long history of antisemitism and cultural oppression History of being viewed negatively by mental health professionals Disclosure of personal information may be delayed until trust is developed Highlights importance of building rapport with American Jewish clients 

00:56:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. Or, or what Terrell and Terrell called cultural mistrust. Uhm, and for, as clinicians, we need to be able to distinguish between, between clinical paranoia, or what I would call, actual paranoia, and the presence of a healthy paranoia in American Jews, because your Jewish clients might be a little suspicious. They might be a little guarded, but they are numerical minority in the United States. They had this long history of antisemitism and oppression. In addition, Jews like people of color in the early 1900s, were viewed negatively by mental health professionals during the eugenics movement. What some people don't know is that Jews were actually considered colored back in the early 1900s and were basically held at the same level as, as the group we now call African-Americans. Back then it was Jews and Negroes were bad, and the eugenics movement was designed to, you know, as some of you know look at the size of the skulls and other physical features to, to then buttress the support that White people were these, people from European descent who were White were the smartest group. So, for all these reasons, your Jewish client, you know, they might not be trusting of, of a Jewish, of the mental health profession, even though of course, it's sort of an irony that we have so many Jewish mental health professionals nowadays. Uhm, but because of this healthy paranoia for those of you who are working with clients, if your client again is a little hesitant to disclose personal information, it may just be because they're waiting to trust you more. They're waiting for that rapport to develop before they're gonna share more intimate details with you. And I think that just highlights the importance of building a rapport with American Jewish clients and I, I, I guess I'd probably don't suppose Jewish clients are, are so, are so wholly different from other clients who also would like to build a rapport with you before they divulge aspects of their life. Another little ah, sort of side piece, which is, I say side piece 'coz as we progress, this becomes less and less attended to as a concept of, bless you, as a concept of the intergenerational- 

00:58:20
Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma Shoah survivors and their descendants carry an additional dynamic into the treatment room Descendants of Shoah survivors may Have a heightened sense of their parents' status as Shoah survivors Have experienced overprotective parenting Over-identify with their parents' experiences in the Shoah View the world as dangerous Have more pronounced healthy paranoia 

00:58:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - transmission of trauma. Okay? And what this is that it's sort of a theory is that people who survived the Shoah uhm, who, who are very few in numbers now, uhm, but, and their descendants carry an additional dynamic into the treatment room. Uhm, you're not likely to see a survivor of the Shoah anyway. Most of them are in their probably in their 90's, a, a, a very old population but their descendants, and their descendant's descendants may come in. And there have been, there's been research to show that the descendants of, of first generation, descendants of Shoah survivors uhm, may have had kind of over protective parenting, because the survivors thought, you know, I've just live through just a world of shit and I'm gonna protect my child as much as possible. I never want to let this happen again. Uhm, they may, the survivor, the descendants might also over-identify with their parents experiences in the Shoah. They may see the world as dangerous and they probably have more pronounced healthy paranoia again because of that over protective parenting and because they know what their parents lived through and then that experience has certainly affected them. So that's what's called the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The reason I said it I see it sort of moving away is that as we move generations away from the Holocaust, people will get further and further away from their, the, the survivors experience. And then it just becomes more about stories told and passed down from generations which may still have an impact, but may not have the same impact if you have let's say a grandchild of a Shoah surv, of someone who survived the Shoah. They might not have the same sort of over-protective style to their children that perhaps their parents did to them. Okay. In addition, it is really crucial to understand- 

01:00:00
Understanding Jewish Identity Understand that Jewish identity is complex, multi-faceted, and context-specific Religious and secular/cultural aspects to Jewish identity Understand clients' sense of their own Jewish identity Consider how, if at all, presenting problems are related to the client's identity as a Jew 

01:00:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - that Jewish identity is a very complex and multi-faceted and context-specific ah, construct. I, I strongly encourage you ah, to check out its Friedlander, no Friedman, Friedlander and Blustein it was in 2005 and the Journal of Counseling Psychologists, Study of American Jewish identity, its one of the first studies of American Jewish identity uhm, and it's a very well done study and it is a very good first ah, place to start ah, in terms of understanding Jewish identity. It's important to remember you have both religious and either secular or cultural aspects of Jewish identity. And as hopefully it is clear now, you need to make sure you understand your client's sense of their own Jewish identity. Again not, we're not gonna make assumptions about what the client's Jewish identity is based on any number of factors or variables. We wanna find out from the client themselves. Okay. Now as, as clinicians, we also wanna make sure that we understand- 

01:00:55
Understanding Jewish Families Family is often the key structure in the client's life Recognize potential value conflicts between individualistic American culture and the more collectivistic nature of Jewish culture Conflict could be experienced based on the needs and wants to please the family (e.g., by achieving career success) versus satisfying one's own desires Emotional consequences (e.g., guilt, anxiety) for going against the wishes of the family 

01:00:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - that the Jewish family is a key structure in the client, in the client's life. And, and of course, now I'm speaking about doing individual therapy, as opposed to doing family therapy or couples work. Uhm, but I think it's important to recognize that there could be value conflicts for your clients between the more individualistic American culture and the more collectivistic nature of Jewish culture. Ah, an example of this is that ah, certainly among American Jews there are strong uhm, pressures placed on American Jews to have career success, to please the family, and also to be involved romantically with a Jewish person. Uhm, and those, those are pressures that are brought to bear over generation. Uhm, but what if the person you fall in love with, isn't Jewish? Uhm, you're also pressured to, to have children. But what if the person you fall in love with, if I'm a man, is also a man? And so, those sorts of pressures, you know, the pleasing the family on the one hand versus satisfying my own desires or my own wishes could create conflicts for American Jews. And so that's something we as clinicians need to be very mindful of. And so, like you're saying, uhm, the, the Jewish, American Jewish client could experience some conflict ah, based on balancing the needs to please their family versus kinda satisfying their own personal wishes and that could be in a number of areas. But again, it's typically in the, in the career of vocational area, as well as, sort of personal relational area. Uhm, another thing to remember as clinicians, is there are serious emotional consequences for going against the wishes of the family. Could, let me give you some examples of guilt and anxiety. But I can recall a story from my own, you know, my own life when I was a ah, I was a senior in college. I was ah, seriously involved with a Catholic woman and my parents never really said much about it to me but I discovered through my brother that this was a subject of great concern among everyone in the family, my parents, my grandparents, that perhaps as I was getting close to graduating, that I might marry this woman and not marry a Jewish, a Jewish person. And of course, the next person I dated after her was my wife who, going with the stereotypes, doesn't look Jewish and my parents first question was "Is she Jewish?" So, they were quite happy about that. But it, it, you know, I'm able to laugh about it now, but, but it highlights the, the seriousness of, ah, from what my, I remember my brother saying to me how unhappy everyone in my family was about who I chose to date, and I was 22. I wasn't thinking about getting married. I just, was someone I was attracted to and someone who I enjoyed spending time with. Uhm, that's so, that's an important thing to remember for clients 'coz they got a lot of pressure to, again like I said, to be involved with someone whose Jewish and to have career success. Those are very important things in the Jewish community. So let me talk to you about some other typical presenting problems that ah, Jewish clients might come to ah, come to you when they come for therapy. Okay. Some of them include, ah, some may come with- 

01:03:55
Typical Presenting Problems Jewish identity issues Body image and gender identity Child rearing practices among interfaith and non-interfaith couples Interdenominational couples Issues around converting to/from Judaism Antisematism-related experiences Sexual orientation and religion Intergenerational issues related to the Shoah 

01:03:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - issues related to their Jewish identity, maybe questioning their identity, uhm, ah, sometimes ah, people sort of stray, if you will, sort of move away from Judaism, and another maybe wannna move back, or they just kind of in an exploring place about, about who they are as Jewish people and how that fits with other aspects of their identity. Uhm, another one, this is especially troublesome for Jewish women, most specifically is the issues of body image ah, and gender identity. Uhm, Jewish women in general, again if you, if you, if you operate on a stereotype, Jewish women have curves, and so in our society where the thin ideal is put out as the ideal, then the, the Jew, the typical Jewish body image of basically having hips and breasts doesn't fit with that thin ideal. And so, that could be a reason that Jewish women come to, to see therapy. In addition, you might have interfaith or non-interfaith couples come for therapy because of child rearing. Uhm, you have interfaith, it could also be Jew and non-Jew but it could also be sort of inter-denomination. You could have someone who is a Reform Jew and someone who is a Conservative Jew. Uhm, and so those, there could be issues about how to raise the child, in terms of, terms of religion but also in terms of other typical parenting questions. Uhm, you also have interdenominational, like I said inter, interdenominational couples, the issues that that presents, people might seek therapy around, people who were converting to Judaism, as well as, people might be converting from Judaism, converting away from Judaism, and the feelings that, that those, that either of those processes ah, raise. And my uncle, who's not my uncle, who's a very good friend of the family, ah, converted to Judaism from being Catholic and went to therapy because not so much he had problems with it, but how to deal with his family who had great problems with it. But he fell in love with a Jewish woman and that it was important to her that he convert and he converted and I think he's probably much more actively involved with the temple than his wife. (laughs). Uhm, Jewish clients might come to therapy for antisemitism-related experiences. They might come to therapy for sexual orientation and religion problems. Typically, of course, this would be potentially someone who feels that they are lesbian or gay and might come from an Orthodox or Hasidic background, and are trying to uhm, kinda how do I make sense of, this is who I am as a person. This is who I love and who I wanna be with, yet I also identify this way over this Jewish community and, and they might be rejecting of me. And so, that might be a reason for someone to come to therapy as well as ah, the intergenerational transmission of trauma that could be, you could have people who come to therapy because ah, parents or grandparents survived the Shoah and there had been some sort of intergenerational effects on that person. Okay. Right. Okay so, let me say a little bit more about the, the Jewish identity piece. Uhm, and with Jewish identity, you have to recognize that if, if the person has internalized antisemitism, what may manifest in therapy with you might be feelings of inferiority, feelings of shame, depression. Uhm, so I think it's important if you, if you believe, as a clinician, that internalized antisemitism is part of the, either affective or behavioral components of the client's problems. That you help them see that the internalized antisemitism is playing a role there. And so, I think that's something that good ah, a good clinician can, if you're able to tease that out, you can really help your client deal with that. And of course, healthy Jewish identity also could be a buffer against antisemitic incidents, a sort of, again the, that's kind of, a sort of a cultural pride thing, that having a good strong identity can kinda buffer against negative things that happened to me or to members of my group. Uhm, okay. 

01:07:50
Converting to/from Judaism Help the client evaluate the potential benefits and consequences associated with making a change Explore feelings about either being a Jew, becoming a Jew, or renouncing one's Jewish identity Also asses the potential impact of what important people in the client's life think and feel about Jews 

01:07:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And so, we talked to, I, I, I already talked about converting to or from Judaism. Ah, the last thing I wanna say about this particular issue is, is to, to come back to the, I mean as I relate to the story of my uncle. Oftentimes, it's not so much the client that you're, you're sort of helping when, when you done with issues of conversion but rather you're helping the client deal with the important people in her or his life uhm, because there'll be people who will be, uhm, there may be people who will be happy, there may be people who are upset about their decision to leave whatever group they're from or they might be upset about the group to which they're joining or it might be both, and so, you know, those of you who know anything about family systems know that a family fights for homeostasis and your client's trying to make a change and so your job is to try to help that client figure out how they can best manage their relationships with the people in their lives as they're making this transition 'coz it's a difficult change for the client themselves. Okay. Ah, a few things about, if you're dealing with clients who come in with antisemitism-related- 

01:08:50
Antisemitism-related experiences Be knowledgeable about the Incidence of antisemitic activities Historical and present manifestations of antisemitism Reasons antisemitism has persisted Don't re-traumatize the client by denying or downplaying the existence, extent, or impact of antisemitism on American Jews Empathic interventions may strengthen rapport if they communicate knowledge about antisemitism 

01:08:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - experiences it's really important for you to be knowledgeable about the incidence of anti-Semitic activities. So, quite easy, you can check out the Anti-Defamation League, their website maintains uhm, information about current antisemitic activities, as well as, the I believe, the American Jewish Committee. There quite a number of Jewish organizations that, that track this. You know, you should be knowledgeable about, about again Classical, as well as, Modern Antisemitism and you should also know why antisemitism has persisted. It helps make you seem like a trusted person to the client and will help them feel more comfortable in disclosing with you. And I think it's ah, perhaps it goes without saying but I think it, it I really wanna mention that you shouldn't re-traumatize your client by denying or downplaying the existence, existence, extent or impact of antisemitism on American Jews. When they're in therapy, it's not the time for the discussion of who's had it the worst, okay? Or well, antisemitism is not as bad as racism or is not as bad as sexism, uhm, that's an academic discussion which is also a fruitless one. Regardless, but it so, and it has no place in psychotherapy, your minimi, your minimization of the experience of, of your client is only gonna traumatize your client and, of course, maybe cause the client to end the treatment early ah, premature termina, premature termination. So, I think your empathic interventions with your client are gonna strengthen the rapport if you can communicate knowledge about antisemitism to the client. Uhm, and again like I said ah, this is, this is important for Jews and non-Jews alike and perhaps even more important for the non-Jew because the Jewish client might give the Jewish therapist sort of the benefit of the doubt because it's like "Oh! You're like me, you understand." But the non-Jewish therapist can really uhm, be seen as an ally and a trusted support by being knowledgeable about issues facing this Jewish client. Okay. So, and talking a little bit in more depth about sexual orientation and religion- 

01:10:45
Sexual Orientation and Religion LGBT Jews must often contend with antisemitism from the LGBT community and homophobia from Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities Multiple oppressions can increase stress Don't make assumptions about which identity is most central at any moment in time Explore meanings of multiple identities, including the intersections of those identities 

01:10:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - is that Jewish who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender often have to contend with antisemitism from LGBT community and at the same time homophobia from the Orthodox and the Hasidic Jewish communities and obviously, you know, being oppressed from potentially both sides can certainly increase stress on these people. Uhm, and so, I think what's important if you have a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender Jew in therapy, it's really important not to make any assumptions about which identity is most central for the client at any moment in time, 'coz that's likely to change depending upon the context of the situation as well as the issue being faced. So, what we should try to do is explore the meanings of the multiple identities, including how they intersect. Again, as psychologists, we should do that even though like well, as researchers anyways sometimes we avoid that 'coz that's complex, and that I can't measure it, it's not quantifiable, but it's really important because these multiple identities shape up who our clients are. Okay. So, to sum it up,- 

01:11:50
Summary Self-awareness is key around attitude and feelings about Jews Address any antisemitic perceptions! Exercise care when inquiring about Jewish identity Consider the possibility of healthy paranoia Seek to understand the daily lived experience of your American Jewish clients Remember that American Jews value debate, insight, and emotional expression 

01:11:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I think it's, I hope it's clear to you that self-awareness is key, in terms of your attitudes and your feelings about American Jews. If you've got any antisemitic perceptions, address them. Right. If you don't know anything about Jews, I think it's time to do a little reading. I think you would do this with, if you had a client and you had no experience with the, the group from which that client comes, you would take some time to educate yourself about that client. American Jews are no different. You should exercise care when you're inquiring about Jewish identity, because you must remember that there is a possibility of healthy cultural paranoia. And I really would implore you to seek the daily lived experience of your American Jewish clients. And also, I, I, I, I think I may have touched on this earlier. Remember that your Jewish clients are gonna value debate, they're gonna value insight, and they're gonna value emotional expression. So, don't be quick to label your Jewish client as defensive and histrionic, because they're very emotionally expressive and they wanna debate a point with you. Right? This is what they were taught to believe. Ah, I was told when I was a chi, uh, I was child, I was told by supervisor of mine when I worked in a hospital, if I were either Christian or Catholic or perhaps maybe Catholic, that my name would be Thomas. And he said that because, he said that Thomas was a doubter. That he was a doubting Thomas and Thomas wanted to see ah, when Jesus came back, he wanted to see the hole in Jesus' hand. He wanted to see the data. Uhm, and I think that, that sort of really captured what I was always brought up to believe, at least in my Jewish community, which is "Okay, it's good to listen to what people have to say, but you shouldn't swallow it whole. You should think about it and come to your own decision." And so, as, as clinicians, we have to remember that, that experience maybe common to American Jews, and as a result, we shouldn't inappropriately pathologize our clients because of these behaviors. Ah, in closing, I'd like to, I thank you very much. And if you have any, if you ever want more information-

01:15:35
Q & A 

01:15:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER  Okay, so the question is about ah, I mentioned a reference work on blacks and Jews and the, ah, and the person in the audience is asking about well, when I sit across from a Jew with white skin if racism(ph) if racism(ph) for me as a black woman then, then it's not potential(ph) for the client, how do you deal with that? The work that uhm, the work that we did ah, on blacks and Jews was, what we call a Pilot Inter-group Encounter Program. And what we tried to do is help people understand first the history, which is a, with, a lot of people don't realize is that blacks and Jews were actually very strong allies in the United States ah, especially during the Civil Rights Movement. The NAACP was founded by African-Americans and Jews. So the, when white people were involved with the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, they were by and large they were Jewish people. What happened is, because Jews have by and large have white skin, they were allowed to pass and they ah, developed greater economical prosperity as a group than African-Americans did. And the group started to splinter because of the so, because of the so, socio-economic differences, because Jews were sort of allowed to succeed and blacks weren't by this racist society. And so, in, in doing this work together, what we did is first try to uhm, introduce concepts to like explain the history of relationships between Blacks and Jews and then asked the members of the group who are, who are actually black, Jewish, as well as, we also have non-blacks and non-Jews in the audience, uhm, to talk about their experiences with uhm, there's racial and culture socialization experiences about blacks and the racial and culture sociali, socialization experiences about Jews. So like what are the messages that you got from your family, from your school, from the media growing up about these groups and how did that sort of impact them. And then we just kind of allowed them the chance to process just sort of talk to each other about the, the strained relationship, and what was co, and there were other instances for those of you who are good students of history know uhm, uh, perhaps the, the, the, the famous antisemitic statement came from Jesse Jackson, when he said New York Jews should go back to, to, to the Hyme, should go back to Hyme town, or friends in New York. And there was an instance in Crown Heights, where ah, and I don't remember the, the facts specifically, somewhat to be careful, I don't wanna get it wrong, but I'm pretty sure that there was an, an incident where a Jewish guy may have hit a young black teenager and then like the ambulance came and only took the Jewish ah, personally and left the, the young black teenager and that caused a lot of riots. Am I getting that, those of you who remember that issue. And so that caused the serious strife it was in Brooklyn, I believe- (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
  In Granites(ph) 

01:18:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - in Granites(ph), so serious strife between the two communities in that area and sort of highlighted the, just in general the sort of the divide that had occurred between blacks and Jews. And so, and I'm actually gonna answer your question, believe it or not, the roundabout,- (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
 (inaudible ) 

01:18:36
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - but the, the roundabout I think what, what, what we learned from it and what we believe to be true is that validating racism doesn't equate with va, doesn't equate with invalidating antisemitism and vice versa. And I think so, too many times people feel like well if we validate you know, validate racism, that all other -isms sort of get excluded. Right? Or if we validate antisemitism, that doesn't mean we're taking away like that somehow racism is any less bad. And so I think that understanding can help like if you're working with like Jewish client, that understanding can help, like okay, well I maybe attuned to race in a di, difference of race between us but I also I'm rem, I mean you're already thinking like I'm remembering well they may or may not be attune to race because maybe being Jewish is the most salient thing to them. And I think you're, you're tapping into a I think a, a deliciously rich area which is like well, what happens when our sort of mu, you know, we have this multiple identities, both of us do, and what's most salient at what time, I mean obviously, you can't ignore the racial differences 'coz you see it uhm, but there are these other differences as well. So I think as a, as a clinician I think you're approaching with the right prospective which is I need to consider like what's salient for me but also what's salient for my client and not to assume that it's one or the other like, okay, well, he's a white Jew so I'm gonna assume that his Jewish identity is more salient. Maybe he is very interested in understanding himself as a white person and maybe not very involved in his Jewish identity who knows? Or maybe, you know, so it depends upon your particular individual client, but I definitely think that sort of knowing I think again, is that the knowledge, like knowing the history and knowing kind of what's going on will really help not you not relying on any assumptions and also for your client, not relying on the assumptions about you because he looks at you, and he says, "Okay, here's a black woman what am I," you know, him or her whoever the, you know, who ever the client maybe. So, does that answer your question? Okay, good thank you. Yeah, so the question is about, Michael said you jot it down ah, privilege plus oppressed equals what? And, and you're kinda tapping into what I think is probably subject for a whole entire video uhm, but which is the issue of Jews of white skin have white skin privilege, yet they also have the experience of being a minority and what do you, like how do we deal with that? (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Uhm, and I think that it's a great question 'coz it allows me to think about it but 'coz it's something I've, I, one of my students and I are gonna begin to look at because when you have dialogues about race, and you have Jews present, Ashkenazim Jew specifically Jews with white skin, they have white skin colored privilege. But when you talk about white culture, and if you ever read like Values of Americans Live by, by Kohls or if you ever read Peggy Macintosh's White Privilege, you know some of the references to white culture Jews distance themselves from they say well, I am white, that if they can acknowledge, I am white I get white skin color privilege yet, I don't, I, you know, white culture isn't me, mine is Jewish culture. So I think it's, there is, there has to be a way in which to work with, with folks in this sorts of uh, dialogues or, or you know activities where you can say, "Okay, you're Jewish," you have to acknowledge it I think, I think there has to be an acknowledgement. You are Jewish you've experience depression yet simultaneously which doesn't take away from it, you have also benefit from skin color privilege because you have white skin. If you know. I actually did a workshop, ah, I think Dianne was there but perhaps you weren't yet there Michael. Uhm, on, we did ah, we had a, a dialogue on race with some of the folks, uhm, where you work now and one person in particular who was a white Jewish woman, for an hour and a half, said, " I," just, just kept saying to me, "I'm not white, I'm Jewish." And just, just, and I, I spent the whole session trying to talk to her about, "Yes, you're Jewish, I get it. You experience suppression but look in the mirror, your skin it is, you know, well, it's pink but it's white as we, as we, as we know it to be white in our discussions of race in our society." And it's just was, the person just wouldn't budge at all. So I mean, it's challenging because, because they, I think because the person that initially, you have to make that first initial acknowledgement I believe. You have to say like, "I understand, you've experienced antisemitism as a Jewish person. Okay I'm gonna meet you there. Right? But then I need to say, "Okay, but I need you to consider the fact that there are multiple identities going on and, and when people look at you, what do people see?" The first thing is, they see a white woman. Right? If you were, if you were something, they might say, "Okay, I see a white Jewish woman," but, you know, but, so, to try to just sort of say, "Well, I know how you see yourself but this is how the world sees you." And, that's gonna be my next trial with this person, if ever I encounter her again, but, but I, I think it's a, a difficult ah, issue because, because Jews are reluctant to identify as white 'coz I think it, I think, I think it makes them feel like they're giving up the Jewish piece and there's, and there has to be a way that you acknowledge your Jewish identity, yet acknowledge your privilege, again, simultaneously, that acknowledgement of one doesn't, doesn't take away from the other. Ah, if that, does that make sense to you? 

01:23:50
 Yeah, yeah. I had(ph) to get to a lot of struggle (inaudible ). 

01:23:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, that, that, well, if I'm Jewish, so I'm not white. It's like, "No, well, you're Jewish and you have white skin." Like, you could have both. So, I mean, and that's the thing like, and, and people need to remember I think that the, the other point I would like to say on this about privilege is that, privilege is context specific. And so, in certain contexts, let's say ah, a lesbian of color might have privilege if she was, let's say, Christian. Right? You might not know I may think of someone, right, as Beverly Green(ph) talks about lesbians of color have, being in triple jeopardy. Right? Being a person of color, being a woman and being a lesbian, it's like you've got, or triple jeopardy, or she said maybe three strikes against you. But, there could be a situation in which you actually have privilege, uhm, because privilege is contextually based. So, I think it's something that, you know, we all need to remember that, part of, I think part of the discussion, is to say, like, we need to help people be able to explore the areas of privilege and the areas of, of a, of repression. And, not assume, we can make assumptions, it's almost goes back to Demolio's(ph) first question, like, we can't even make assumptions about what identity is most, you know, in therapy, but same within this, in multicultural discussions, like, what identity is most salient at what time? Unless of course, you're saying, "Okay, today, I wanna talk about race?" You know. And that's when it gets complicated. I don't think there's really a good answer. It's- (crosstalk) 

01:25:10
 It's very good(ph). 

01:25:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER - it's more like, these are my thoughts on it right now. I think there's a lot more work that needs to be done there. And so the comment from the audience was just that, the person said, uhm, that we should move as a field towards studying multiple identities, which is absolutely true. Okay, so the question is, what are the ways in which, as an African American woman, you can make the environment, uhm, attractive, uh, comfort, you know, uh, making clients feel comfortable when they come to see you. So, how do you, how do you, the space and how do you deal without, without words. How do you non-verbally do it. I mean, that's a, a good question because, as I think about what, what would be in an environment in which I feel welcome, I would feel welcome in most environments and then it makes me do the flip, like, what would be in an environment which I feel unwelcome. And, what would make me runaway. And, of course, the first thing would be, if you had a big, huge, cross, like on the wall, uhm, even if you have vary of faith, and I think, well, this is a part of who I am. It might make your client come and say, "Okay, well, this person, really strongly believes in, in her Christian faith, and might not get me, or because of the experience, might try to convert me." Because, Jews have been targeted for conversion by a lot of Christian groups, including a group calling themselves, if you ever have seen them in the subway, the Jews for Jesus, ah, they usually come out at the high holidays. I haven't seen them, and I'm surprised, I usually come at the high holidays, which is going on now. And they come out at Passover, uhm, and then they pass out pamphlets. And there's essentially a Christian group trying to convert Jews, and I always engaged them in dialogue in the subway, and I say, you know, "We have a group of Jews for Jesus in the coun-, in the United States, we call them Christians," and they just you know, they sort of, they, you know, they, they believe what they believe so they don't wanna have the discussion. But, I mean I think, having an environment that's welcoming to any client, I mean, I think, I think the comfort that you, I think the comfort that you expe-, this is my, my own assumptions uh, from my own clinical work, and what I used to do, the exp-, the, the comfort that you feel in your space, I think it's communicated to clients. That's, that's my belief. So, like, if I'm comfortable in my space, like, they're gonna feel comfortable when they come in with me. Like, that would be exudative. Like, the, they're gonna feel that, like, just like if you walk into my office and, and then you walked into my office here uhm, hopefully, if, it's not therapy, but it's, you know, in my academic office, it feels comfortable. Right? 'Coz, it's just, you see that I am comfortable in there, has, has my stuff around there. And, I probably, wouldn't have all the chotchke, the sports chotchkes I have up, you know, in the therapy office, but I would wanna have a place, where I feel comfortable because, if you're not comfortable, you're feeling fidgety, or, you know, what do you think you're clients gonna feel? Uhm, ah, I don't know, like, of the top, (inaudible ) I think, I don't know that I would put, uhm, any, like, symbols up in my wall or something, but what I might have is some kind of like if I'm providing services, I might have a statement about myself and my beliefs, like, either on my website if I'm in private practice, or, or a lot of, a lot of clinicians will, in private practice or settings where there inform-consent issues. On my inform consent and all I might give them, like a, a handout about what's a therapy like, like sort of an introduction to the, like a, sort of a role-induction thing. And, I might, put it, put there. Try to put some statements like, I, I value multicultu, I mean, make it explicit. Not to say like, I love Jews, you know, but you can say, you know, I value diversity, I value the multiple identities that you might bring to therapy and I want you to feel comfortable in talking about whatever aspects of your self are, are gonna be helpful to you. Like, I mean, to just sort of, put that out there for clients so they think, okay. Because, of course, the absence of it, for the person who doesn't put it there, how does the client know how you feel about, about different, you know, so, I think that's one way, is to try to make it explicit with them. And if it's part of your printed materials, it, it's almost like, it becomes, it's part of your mission. Right? And you're not an institution but if you, but I think about, that if I'm gonna be working with clients, I want them to know, these are, these are my values. I've, I've I actually personally believe we should disclose our values to our clients. Not on this whole big discussion about, oh, I believe this and I believe that, but, but there should be some level that they get, they understand, like, this is what you're getting into when you're getting into therapy with me. Those of you in the room, who've had me in class now, I do that same thing with you. We go over the syllabus and I say, this is my contract with you. I agree to do this, and you agree to do that. But when you, it's like, it's inform consent. You should know what you're getting into. And, if you're going into therapy with someone, they should know what they're getting into. And, and know that you value things.
