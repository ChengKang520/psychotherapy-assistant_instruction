The Evolution of Psychotherapy Anxiety Francine Shapiro, Ph.D. Mental Research Institute 

00:00:00
 Okay, so we are starting exactly in time. We have one more fascinating events, ah, dialogue between Francine Shapiro and Jeffrey Zeig about the topic of, ah, anxiety. And I think I have not to speak much about the two, they are very, very known. Francine Shapiro is one who have, ah, bought some innovation to the field looking back the last, ah, 40 years not so much new had happened. She was, ah, successful to bring really a very good new idea and both that this is effective what she is doing. Jeffrey Zeig is, ah, my very dear friend and he is the only person I know who can be at two places at the same time. Uhm, he can be teaching here and at the same organize Evolution congress and he is so good organizer. We'll never see a two persons at the same place at the same time. So that's really incredible. So, okay, I do not know who will start. Francine, so, okay. 

00:01:10
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Anxiety Francine Shapiro, Ph.D. Mental Research Institute Causes of Anxiety and EMDR Therapy Treatment • Healthy alert system • Organic deficit •Unprocessed memories of adverse lift experiences • Impairment of one aspect of life • General impairment of multiple domains • Process etiological events, current triggers and memory template for appropriate future action • 84-100% of single-trauma PTSD processed within the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions • 83% of phobics treated within the same timeframe • Anxiety management with bilateral stimulation alone 

00:01:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Thank you. Ah, well, I'm gonna begin in my emphasis is going to be on treatment of anxiety from an EMDR therapy perspective. And people have asked me what's the EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. A really terrible name I would-- if I had a chance change it to reprocessing therapy but here we are. So the, uhm, the look were-- when we're looking at anxiety in terms of, ah, treating it, we first start it, we have the fact that it can be a healthy alert system. The anxiety is there to let us know that there's something wrong or there can be an organic deficit. So, some people have people have weaker cardiac systems other in terms of their response systems, there's heightened arousal. But when those aren't the cases, when it's not based in an organic deficit from an EMDR perspective, we would say that unprocessed memories of adverse life experiences are really pushing the anxiety and that anxiety can be in one domain or-- of life or it can be an impairment in multiple demands. So, what we would be looking at is the notion that across the board, uhm, de-- of DSM. The pathology is caused by unprocessed memories of earlier life experiences that are stored in the brain. So, when the information processing system is working appropriately, it's there to digest experiences if you will and integrate it with the-- ah, larger memory networks. But if the information processing system is overwhelmed, then the experience get stored in memory with the emotions, physical sensations and beliefs that were there at the time. And then anything that happens in the present has to link up with our memory networks to be made sense of. And if links into a network with an unprocessed memory, then negative emotions and physical sensations can arise whether it's guilt or shame or anxiety. So we look to process the earlier events that are the foundation for it. The kind of situations that trigger the disturbance, and we incorporate memory net-- uhm, memories-- templates for appropriate future action if someone is always been anxious in a certain situation like social situations. And they'd never really learned to communicate appropriately than part of what we do would be teaching appropriate communication skills and then processing that to integrate it. So the research on the EMDR, uhm, there are more than 20 randomized control trials that have, ah, demonstrated it's, ah, effectiveness for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder for instance. And it's recognized by the World Health Organization as only two forms of therapy that are effective for treating children, adolescence and adults for PTSD. And what we found is that 84 to a 100% of single-trauma victims lose their PTSD diagnosis within the equivalent of three mi-- 90-minute sessions. And the same thing is what we're finding with phobics. Ah, I'll show you a study where 83% of phobics were treated in the same timeframe. And also how we use, ah, anxiety management bilateral stimulation. The-- one of the elements of EMDR are bilateral eye movements or taps or tones. 

00:04:55
Research Supported Hypotheses 25 randomized studies on EM • Eye movements tax working memory - effects imagery vividness and decreases associated emotions • BLS stimulate a brain state thought to be similar to that which occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in which sleep-dependent processing of episodic memories has been shown to be specifically facilitate • the development of insight into and understanding of the memories. • reduction or elimination of associated negative effect. • their integration into existing semantic networks. 

00:04:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And now, there's research supported hypotheses there have been about 25 randomized studies on the eye movement. It shows that the eye movement taxes working memory. So if we are trying to remember a, ah, telephone number, it only has seven numbers because that's about all we can hold. Now, the theory is, if you add in the eye movement on top of it, it causes the, ah, visual imagery and the emotion to reduce. Another hypothesis that's been supported by research, is that stimulation links in to the same processes that occurred during rapid eye movement sleep. And one of the things that are occurs during rapid eye movement sleep is a-- the episodic memory, the experiences that happened during the day wh-- which are originally have those emotions, physical sensations and beliefs. The eye movement period allows it to link with other memories so you have an argument with someone at work and you get all caught up and all anxious and upset. And think about it, talk about during REM you can wake up feeling better the next morning because the linkages include, John was having was bad day, we've gotten long before, I know what to do with it. And that integration is taken place. So, again if the information processing is overwhelmed that REM state can't work. So what we're doing with the procedures of the EMDR therapy appears to restart the information processing system so things can get digested. 

00:06:30
Effects of Eye Movement Component of EMDR Therapy with PTSD Patients Sack et al., 2008/JAD "(R)esults indicate that sets of eye movements were followed by a relaxation response... and a simultaneous increase in parasympathetic tone." 

00:06:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here is an example of what happens, the effects of the eye movement when they, ah, looked at the EMDR procedures, what happens physiologically when you add in the eye movement you see an immediate decrease in anxiety to decrease an eral-- arousal indicated that what you're doing is increasing the sympathetic-- the parasympathetic tone so that automatically relaxation comes up. 

00:07:00
Disturbing Images of the Future "Flashforwards" • Students who suffered from recurrent distressing intrusive images about impending danger. • Two negative visual images about events they feared might happen to them in the future (e.g., the funeral of a loved one, being hit by a car) • These flashforwards were randomly disturbed to either 'recall with eye movement' or 'recall only' condition • Effects after total of 96 seconds of recall plus eye movements 

00:07:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The use of the eye movement alone, they found with anxiety me-- ah, images. People are anxious that something terrible is going to happen to them and they get anxious. So in this case, students who suffered from distress of images, ah, were asked to bring up two negative images of events they feared like the funeral of a loved one or being hit by a car. And these images were randomly distributed to a group that was just gonna think about them. And another group where then eye movement was being added in, and here you'll see the effects of a total-- of 96 seconds of recall plus the eye movement. 

00:07:40
Vividness eye movements just retrieval Engelhard et al., 2010 Emotionality 

00:07:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, you see the difference for, ah, recall alone and then, uhm, i n terms of vividness and then in terms of emotionality. So there is a decrease just from the 96 seconds. And what they've started utilizing now is-- in, in many of the EMDR psychotherapy work is adding this in as a component to help those again who has distressing images and can't really tell you why. You know, somebody they saw something it doesn't matter-- they just continue to have this, this is their primary problem, the anxiety from this and so the eye movement alone has been work, ah, is works. 

00:08:25
First Session Outcome of EMDR Therapy Treatment of PTSD SUD scores pre and post single treatment session of EMDR and PE. Rogers et al., 1999 

00:08:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO But here's an example of, ah, a study that was done with Combat Veterans. This is EMDR mo-- complete procedures along with the eye movement and you can see that the subjective units of distress scores com-- went all the way down compared to exposure therapy where-- which is the other validated therapy for PTSD where you're thinking about it and have to describe it detail. You have to relieve the even basically and talk about it, and talk about it, ah, with EMDR you don't need to talk about it, all you have to do is hold it in mind in a certain way after preparation and the procedures allow that movement to take place. And again, three sessions, uhm, for an 84 to a 100% remission of single PTSD. 

00:09:15
Dental Phobia DENTAL ANXIETY BEFORE AND AFTER Three sessions of EMDR therapy 

00:09:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here we have a dental phobia study. Ah, three sessions, the ah, the participants most of them went to subclinical after the three sessions, after a year, ah, 83.3% of the patients were in regular dental treatment. So the point is that even though we have a lot of people going into physicians complaining about anxiety with and then they get medicated you see. If you look at the literature for instance, they're going for high anxiety and what it really is, ah, is the outgrowth of post-traumatic stress disorder. But then not queried about this and the World Health Organization has said that you should not be using pharmaceuticals for that. And the thing that's also important to know is that there are studies showing that adverse life experiences that don't raise to the level of major trauma can cause even more PTSD symptoms then major trauma. So someone comes in with anxiety, complaining about anxiety, and the person never thinks in terms of PTSD they just think, oh, while you've been anxious, you've been anxious for a long time it must be organic, let's give medications, you can feel better. When actuality-- actually what they need is therapy processing those memories that are pushing the anxiety. 

00:10:40
Anxiety Assessment Simple v Complex • Severe depression, panic attacks daily, marriage difficulties • Onset: Hearing that her sister had been molested • Early memories: childhood medical illnesses, childhood interactions with their sister, and her childhood perception of disappointing her mother • 14 memories processed in 12 sessions with three Negative beliefs: (a) "I am worthless," (b) "I am trapped." (c) "It's my fault." • Desired "I'm worthwhile": "I'm free": "I'm innocent." 

00:10:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And there's a difference when you're looking at assessment as to whether it's going to be simple or complex. If it's simple P-- simple PTSD you're identifying one memory for instance in a tra-- ah, trauma that needs to processed. But here, there's an example of a client with severe depression, panic attacks daily, marriage difficulties. The onset was simply hearing that her sister had been molested. The early memories that are identified with the-- in, in the history taking phase of EMDR that needed to be processed were early memories of childhood medical illness, childhood interactions with her sister, and her childhood perceptions of disappointing her mother. They used 14 sessions and processed 12, uhm, and 14 memories were processed in 12 sessions with three negative beliefs which we look at as the verbalization of how you're feeling. I'm anxious because I feel I'm worthless. I'm trapped. It's my fault. And he desire-- the desire thought was I'm worthwhile, I'm free, I'm innocent that would show you that basically this, this problem has been digested. Now, since EMDR does not need homework, you're able to do consecutive sessions. 

00:12:00
Anxiety - Panic Attacks Concentrated EMDR Therapy RESULTS: Beck's Anxiety Inventory 12 sessions - 3 sessions per week Grey, 2011 Depression Concentrated EMDR Therapy RESULTS: Beck's Depression Inventory. II Grey, 2011 

00:12:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, here are the results of 12 sessions, three day-- three, ah, per week. And you can see that decline of treatment into subclinical levels. But the en-- the thing to keep in mind is an-- anxiety isn't all-- in necessarily in isolation. Were also found was this-- the same decline in the depression. So they go together and if we're looking at these effects who never ac-- negative effects of guilt or shame anxiety as really being locked in these earlier unprocessed memories. Then the processing allows it to move and all of these negative effects are able to-- were meet.

Earthquake in Mexico 1 Session (85 to 120 minutes) Mean Impact of Event Scores 12 week follow-up - despite aftershocks (Jarero et al., 2011) 

00:12:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here is an example of a one session treatment for, ah, earthquake victims in Mexico. And so just the one session was able to bring to subclinical levels again, ah, 12-week follow-up despite aftershocks and so it maintains. The, the bottom line being here is the real need to look at not only, uhm, healing for those victims when you think of the me-- the massive amounts of natural and man-made disasters that occur in the world. And therefore, the amount of PTSD that's out there and the amount of anxiety response is that are out there. But recognize that there's also new research that indicates that mothers who have PTSD will maltreat their children, they don't mean to but they're so primed and so anxious their brain is so lit up that if the child cries instead of feeling like bonding and connecting, they push away and get anxious, or then-- or they're very reactive. And so what we need to look at is the ability to go in and use effect-- ah, effective treatment in metaphor-- healing the mothers we are also preventing and intergenerational transfer of pain.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 #EVO2013 

00:14:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Read. Uhm, I'm, ah, glad to take over from that point just a couple pf things first of all, our moderator Bernard Trenkle's might counterpart in Europe, he's on the board of directors at the er-- Erickson Foundation and these-- quite renown especially for the conferences that he organizes in Europe. And, ah, another thing is I have to leave very quickly at the end of this program because I have another program immediately after. I usually like to stay and visit with people and s-- apologize for not doing that. And then it's really wonderful to be, ah, ah, with Francine who have known for many years I don't know that we've shared the podium before. 

00:15:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Ah... 

00:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG No. And, ah, I'm you know, always impress with Francine's works and I'm a great fan and supporter of EMDR and also the contrast is very interesting because I have a very different way of thinking, a very different approach. And I really extremely admire the statistics that Francine keeps and how she has made EMDR work by keeping her fingers on the pulse of research, and it's to my own chagrin that we don't have that same orientation in an Ericksonian approach. Now, being Ericksonian, well, that gives me license to tell stories and I never get enough opportunity to talk about my Erickson stories. So I'll tell you my very favorite old time Erickson story which involves me and my anxiety. So, uhm, this is 1978, I'm a new psychologist and I moved to Phoenix Arizona. I get a telephone call and the call is from an attorney. And the attorney says I've been referred to you by Milton Erickson I'm representing a young man who has been charged with murder. A police investigator has done hypnosis in order to refresh the memory of a witness. I believe that the hypnosis that was done by the police investigator has been done incorrectly, improperly and hence, the witness' testimony has been contaminated by this poorly done hypnosis. Will you view the videotape and be an expert in this case? Ah, I said, well, I'm a new psychologist and I have never testified in a courtroom before. But it's interesting to me so I'll be glad to give you my best opinion, my honest opinion of what's happening. So my credentials was submitted to the court that I was trained by Milton Erickson, world's greatest authority on hypnosis and I was accepted as an expert for the defense. Well, excuse me, meanwhile the prosecuting attorney calls Milton Erickson. And the prosecuting attorney says, the legitimacy of hypnosis as a forensic tool is being challenged, will you be an expert? And Dr. Erickson says, "Oh, I'm too old to him, too ill call Zeig." But the prosecutor says, "No, we need a national expert. And if you won't testify, will give a deposition? So will at least view the video and give an official opinion that can be read into the court record." And Dr. Erickson says, "Okay." So now the sides are even, it's Zeig for the defense and Erickson for the prosecution. So, ah, that lead to a little anxiety. And I called Dr. Erickson, I said, "Can I come and visit you please?" And he said, "Of course." And I said, ah, calmly and most, ah, tempered voice, "What are you doing?" And he said, "Well, Jeff, you have a few things to learn, don't you?" And I said, "Definitely." And then I thought about it for a minute and I said, "You know, Dr. Erickson, ah, I'm nervous, I'm scared, I, I'm anxious. I've never testified in a courtroom before in the thought of being attacked by attorneys, it makes me really anxious. Do you think you can give me some therapy?" And Dr. Erickson looked at the floor and meditated for a moment and who knew that the therapy was going to happen by virtue of a story which was his primary delivery system. And he said, "Know something about the opposing attorney." He said, he was called to testify in a case previously where he was testifying for the husband and a child custody case. And this was a time when the wife always got custody and he was testifying that the husband should be the primary custodial parent for these children. So he had done a psychiatric examination on the husband, a psychiatric examination on the wife. And he was prepared to testify that the husband was the right person to be a custodial parent. Now, in a pre-trial meeting, he was knocked given any information about the wife's attorney. So he surmised inferred that she would be somebody who was very challenging. And on the day of the courtroom he is sitting in the witness box and the attorney for the wife comes up challengingly with 13 pages of typewritten questions to undermine Dr. Erickson's testimony. And in a very aggressive way she says, "Dr. Erickson, you say that you're an expert in psychiatry. Who is your authority?" And Dr. Erickson says, "Well, I'm my authority." Because he knows that if he says Freud, or Jung, or Perls, or Berne she's going to say, "Are those theories speculative?" And she's going to start to undermine his testimony. And again she's challenging, and says to Dr. Erickson, "You says you're an expert in psychiatry, what is psychiatry?" And Dr. Erickson looks at her calmly and says, "I can give you an example. If I was an expert on American history, I would know something about Simon Girty." And he looks at her and says, "Also called Dirty Girty. Because any expert on American history would know something about Simon Girty also called Dirty Girty, and every expert on American history should know about Simon Girty also called Dirty Girty, and every expert on American history certainly knows the history of Simon Girty also called Dirty Girty." Dr. Erickson said that at that moment he looked up at the judge and the judge had his hands over his face. He said that the attorney for his side was trying to suppress an uncontrollable laugh and the secretary of the court was underneath the table trying to find a pencil. The attorney looked up at him and said, "No, further questions Dr. Erickson." And the name of the attorney? Girty. And Erickson was saying Dirty Girty. Now, suddenly, I was overwhelmed with confusion, now this black lay anxiety because I had to think what was it that he was saying to me. And then I gradually begin to tease it out and he was saying, "Don't be intimidated." And he was saying, "You have a resource in your own history that may come to your mind and give you a way of dealing with this." He was suggesting, you can use unusual communication forms, you can use some of the hypnotic techniques that you've learned from me such as using embedded commands. It's nice too, really be at ease. That's an embedded command. And suddenly, I got it and it was an experiential moment of getting it. And it wasn't a cognitive moment because Dr. Erickson wasn't cognitive, he was completely experiential. And he is laughing so hard while he's telling me the story about Dirty Girty and I'm laughing because he is laughing. And now, what happens to me is that every time I walk in to a court room, I have hallucination. And it's hallucination of me and Dr. Erickson and we're in this living room and he's telling me the story about Dirty Girty and I'm laughing and he is laughing. And I see the courtroom but I see it through that hallucination and it completely changed my orientation to walking into a courtroom and-- that had a generally-- of the fact and other situations. Now, the interesting thing about that and one of the things that is different from Francine and I is that I don't treat anxiety. She's an expert in anxiety but I don't anxiety. To me anxiety is a category and one of my rules that I have for myself and that might interest you is don't treat categories, treat components. And that if you try to treat the category, which is okay if you're doing EMDR and it's okay if you're doing medicine but for me, the idea is what are the components? Anxiety is just a construct of convenience and we understand the phenomenology, if we understand the physiology, if we understand the process, if we understand the interpersonal valence we can treat the components. And it's by virtue of treating the components that we can begin to generate change. Anxiety is a system, it's not a thing. It's construct of human convenience that we lump things and we call them anxiety or depression or schizophrenia when in fact there are compilation of parts. And if we change the parts, the systemic is, if you change a systemically significant number of components then the problem changes. Maybe I can give you, ah, a little bit of an example. And we'll go to the slide. 

00:24:50
I. Defining Anxiety • Defining Anxiety: - Impending doom - Unresolved arousal - Anticipatory tension - fear of not being good enough/failure The Panoply of Anxiety Disorders: • Adjustment reaction; • Simple phobia; • Agoraphobia; • GAD; • PTSD; • Panic Disorder; • OCD; • "Co-morbidity." II. Distinctions • Mr. Fear says: "There is threat: React!" • Mr. Anxiety says: "There is perceived threat: Prepare!" • Mr. Depression says: "There is perceived threat and nothing I can do will help: Ignore! Collapse!" • Mr. Panic says, "I am afraid of dying or losing control!" • Mr. Stress says: There is pressure: React. • Mr. Burnout says: "There is no way to achieve my essential goals. I have had it." Ayala Pines' work 

00:24:55
JEFFREY ZEIG First of all, I'm similar this-- though Francine in that-- to me Anxiety is anxiety, is anxiety, is anxiety. Now, that's not certainly true to David Barlow who would think that anxiety is something different because there's a panoply of anxiety disorders from a simple adjustment reaction to OCD and certainly plenty of co-morbidity along the way. But, uhm, to me Mr. Fear says, "There's a threat, react!" Fear is good, we need to have fear in order to survive. Mr. Anxiety says, "There is a perceived threat, a possible threat, do something right now." And Mr. Panic says, "I'm afraid of dying and I'm afraid or afraid of losing control." Mr. Stress and I don't mind stress. Mr. Stress says, "There is pressure, react." And Mr. Burnout says, "Well, there's no way that I can possibly achieve my essential goals. So, ah, collapse. I've had it." 

00:25:55
IV. "Do" Anxiety • How does the person "Do" anxiety: • Anxiety-ing • Create a map • What is phenomenology? • Turn the problem into a process. • If the problem is nominalized, turn it into a verb. • Turn it into a relationship pattern. • Etc. Elements of Communication III. Elements of Communication • Use the elements of communication to determine the phenomenology of anxiety; • Mapping the structure of the problem (and solution) vs. mapping the developmental history. • Promoting systemic change. Elements of Communication* Primary 1. Feeling 2. Thought 3. Behavior 4. Sensory (perceived and represented) 5. Rational 6. Biological Secondary 1. Attitude 2. Context 3. Qualitative 4. Ambiguous 5. Symbolic 6. Idiosyncratic 7. Cultural 8. Etc *Refer to following slide for source information. Source From "Symptoms Prescription Techniques: Clinical Applications Using Elements of Communication," by Jeffrey Zeig, Ph. D., The American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, Volume 23, Number 1, pp. 23-33. 

00:26:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So I don't about anxiety, I think about does this person do with anxiety. How is this person anxiety-ing? And I think about the elements that are involved in anxiety and the elements could feelings, and thoughts. For some people if I say how do you know you're anxious they say, "Well, I feel tense." For other people, how do you know you're anxious, "Well, I have this terrible thoughts." For other people, how do you know that you're anxious, "I-- I'm shaking." And they define their anxiety as a behavior. For other people they define their anxiety as a sensory image, "I've got these, ah, horrible images in my mind." For other people they define anxiety as relational. They're anxiety is a kind of withdrawal. And for other people they say, "Well, I have a blu-- I have anxious genes." And they define their anxiety as being something biological. So I'm listening for the components. How does this person define their anxiety? And some people, their anxiety could be an attitude or a contextual aspect or a qualitative aspect, or it could be something ambiguous. And theories and psychotherapy they are similar because theories and psychotherapy pick up on some element of communication and they create their theories. So for some people essential in psychotherapy is feelings and for other people essential in psychotherapy is relationships. And for other people essentially in psychotherapy is attitudes. And because the problem is a system, if you change the attitude, that may have systemic, a generative systemic effect. If you do something relational that may have a generative systemic effect. It is a principle in my life to look for an interactional solution if the problem stopping smoking, or anxiety or depression, look for a solution that involves other people. Don't look for a solution that is just inside the box. 

00:28:00
Major Category for Maps: • Phenomenology • Systemic Aspects (internal and social) • Process • Physiology • (History) • (Psychodynamics) The "Maps" Diamond State/Substates (Phenomenology) Sequence Social Pattern Somatic Signs 

00:28:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So I create maps. And the maps that I create are based on four S's. And I look for the substates, the somatic signs, the sequences and the social patterns. And I create a kind of map in my mind, how does this person do anxiety? What are the central aspects of the way in which this person is anxiety-ing? And how can I orient to working on one aspect, the perceptual aspect or a behavioral aspect, or a cognitive aspect, or a, ah, historical aspect. And so this is, ah, my style of trying to think about problems in general not only anxiety but the panoply of psychological problems. I don't treat categories. I look for the components. I start making an orientation, a shift. I see if one component can be changed. If that has a systemic reverberating effect, the generative effect, if not, I try another component until there is enough components that changed to cause a, ah, a generative effect and help this person out of an inflexible position into a more vibrant and flexible position. 

00:29:20
"Love" • Take • Obvious • Pleasure • In • Another's • Happiness USING "MAPS" TO ESTABLISH TREATMENT STRATEGIES • MAP • Phenomenology • Physiology • Process • Pattern of Interaction • Versus • Development • Deficits in Knowledge • Biology • Strategy • "Flip it" • Somatic work (Interoceptive desensitization) • Pattern Disruption • Interactional Solution • Versus • Interpretation • Psycho-education • Medication 

00:29:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So you know, it's the map that determines the territory and if you're thinking about development you may use interpretation. If you're thinking about deficits and knowledge you might use psycho-education. If your lens is biology you might use medication. If your lens phenomenology, you flip it. If the person is withdrawn in order to be anxious, then how can you get that person engaged? If the problem is, ah, more in the realm of physiology, how can you do somatic work like the desensitization that Francine does or interoceptive desensitization. If you threat the anxiety through the lens of seeing it as a process, anxiety is a process, it's not a thing, it's temporal. And if you can disrupt any part of that process that may have a systemic effect. And if you look at anxiety as an interaction pattern then you look for an interactional solution. You look for a solution that involves other people. So, to me interestingly, and contradistinction to the way that Francine works, I'm much more holistic, uhm, in my approach, I don't have a treatment. Ah, I admire her cuz she has a treatment that she uses in well-research but my approach is much more artistic sometimes autistic. Ah, and, ah, you know, differs so we have a little bit of contrast in that area. Okay, so please we have a few moments to - 

00:30:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY ZEIG - react to each other and then we welcome you to come to the microphone and whatever questions you have we try to address them. 

00:31:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, I think there's more convergence that you're aware of and, ah, let me say the onset. I think every clinician should learn Ericksonian Hypnosis. 

00:31:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And I think we should all learn EMDR. 

00:31:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well. I mean, ah, from very early on I think I can't, ah, having this-- having the tool of hypnosis and bringing that into psychotherapy, I think it's just so extremely important to be able to integrate the wisdom of the field and that's why this conferences are great. Uhm, in terms of what we actually do with EMDR therapy, it's-- wouldn't be treating anxiety separately and specifically. What we found is that if we access these earlier memories, the person may start out feeling anxious, but what we're aware of is when you start the processing, when those linkages take place they get in touch with what's really below it. It become-- they just start talking about the sadness that's there. They talk about other experiences they had. So the anxiety, I kind of look at it as the coverall. Now, the-- of course anxiety disorders which by the way in the new DSM-- PTSD is not an anxiety disorder anymore. Ah, the DSM changing is kind of like this Chinese menu you know, things from column A, things from column B stick them together will give them that label and sometimes we'll put them in that category, that category. But you know, the bottom line from an, again the EMDR therapy perspective is that however we're reacting the world, if we're racking-- if we're reacting in a healthy way, it's because the experiences we've had have been learning experiences. They become well-integrated and are able guide us appropriately. When we've had experiences that have get-- gotten stock, unprocessed they continue to push negative behaviors. If I'm feeling insecure whatever you know, that is for different people. If I feel insecure and I can't connect them, not able to abound appropriately, it's affecting relationships. It's affecting my sense of self. It's accepted-- affecting my ability to do well in world. All of these were looking at and is basically coming from these unprocessed memory. So, if a person is coming in, and they're coming in for a reason, and they say, I can't do X, Y in present or I'm feeling such and such in the present, what we do is isolate the current situations that are disturbing and use a variety of techniques to have them, be able to link back to identify where did that first start? What's that early-- earlier memories that are pushing him in that direction and that's what process. And when you're processing, it goes through a whole realm of emotions again from anxiety, to sadness, to guilt, to shame, to acceptance, to forgiveness and you see that, that movement. I'll, I'll show, ah, a tape during the conversation now or tomorrow morning if you're interested. But, but the bottom line we also look at it systemically. And how was that affecting the person in the present in terms who they are and in terms of the relationship. 

00:34:25
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, and another thing that's a similarity is that we're both intensely experiential. You know, my definition of psychotherapy is very simple, that psychotherapy is a symbol drama of change. The imperative of which is by living this experience you will be different. By living this experience you will be empowered. So it's not about giving information, it's about establishing an experience that helps the person to surmount a previous inflexibility and move into a place that is infinitely more flexible. And, uhm, and I see this-- is you know, important. It's important for us to know and have conceptualizations. I'm more on the conceptualization side today in thinking about anxiety than I am on the treatment side. But I think once you can find a way of doing conceptualization, you can find a way of doing treatment and find something that will work. And curiously, you know, different from s-- Francine because psychotherapy is such a strange bird and nobody really knows what is the essential unit of analysis. I did a book and-- of talking about this later today called What Psychotherapy where I brought together 90 different contributors and ask them for a capsule definition of what is psychotherapy. And what to-- in a-- in order to try to determine what is the essential unit of analysis. Well, if you got physics, you have to know that particles are essential and you establish physics by understanding essential particles which could quarks or they could be electrons. And that allows you to have a science. Now, in psychotherapy we can't agree on what's essential, is it history? Is it relationship? Is it attitudes? Is it behavior? Is it physiology? We don't have a defining unit in our field that indicates to us how we can build the science around the defining unit. And in just a position to what Francine does, where she's processing memories and of course memories are really important in understanding ha-- our formative nature. I, I don't pay much attention to memories at first. And I try to treat things on a much more moment to moment, uhm, structural basis rather than on a historical basis. But I have no problem with treating things on a historical basis, as long as you should create an experience around which change constellates. If you think about, hmm, sugar candy and you're making sugar and you have this supersaturated solution, and it's full and then and it's boiling, it's threatening to boil over and create quite a mess. Well, if you have a thread and you put that thread into the supersaturated solution, suddenly crystallization happens and it takes on a different form. And it doesn't-- and no longer threatens to spill over and create a mess. And the therapy situation should be that thread that we put in that creates a crystallization of a new set of-- a new combination of the resources that are inherent. Everybody knows how to deal with anxiety because everyone has a history of having dealt adequately with anxiety. I don't need to teach people. I need to establish a condition by which they can re-constellate, re-crystallize the resources that are already there. So, I-- I'm charmed, I'm interested and I like the contrast of being able to dialogue with Francine and just to show some of the different ways that we think because there's so many different roads to hone. So please, ah, if we, ah, any other interaction or we-- would be glad to, ah, entertain any questions except from Rose because Rose has a tendency from my own history to go on endlessly. Rose... 

00:38:45
ROSE Because Rose has been censored and silenced for 19 years after she wrote nine books in 1994 - 

00:38:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Rose. 

00:38:50
ROSE - that is revolutionizing the world then everyone is plagiarizing from her. 

00:38:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, fortunately I can't understand what you're saying... 

00:38:55
ROSE But, ah, if humanistic psychology introduced an existential anxiety and I've introduced an existential power which means by redefining what is anxiety. You know, I-- my heart is beating because I know you're gonna have a derogatory statement toward me. But, I redefine it instead of anxiety to anticipation of the conversation and the dialogue which is a always gonna be positive because we evolve from it. And so, ah, patterns came from my heart. I instead of Freud who says, "Until the age of 7 you are fixated then you won't change." I said everyone is good, everyone comes from a core and everyone can change it anytime, the patterns must change. 

00:39:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Beep. Your 30 seconds are up. 

00:39:50
ROSE That's all the patterns. Patterns can... 

00:39:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Rose, are you wearing a badge? Are you registered for the conference? 

00:39:55
ROSE I, I am invited because everything in conference is from me and I, I, I'm your friend, are you treating me like a friend? My, my microphone just, just stopped. 

00:40:10
JEFFREY ZEIG We, we have a long interaction with Rose. And, ah, thank you so much and unfortunately I couldn't understand your comments. Ah, I'm tough on you Rose and I, I'm tough on you because I know that you can keep it together in a way that, ah, I'm not sure that you know. Okay, now, ah, the, the person who is, uhm, moni-- ah, monitoring the sound, the repeater on stage is not working so I really couldn't understand what Rose was saying. I don't know you cou... 

00:40:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:40:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, they did - 

00:40:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay, thank you. 

00:40:45
JEFFREY ZEIG - because there in the audience and the speakers are going outward but we have repeater on stage that should be helping us when, ah, somebody is asking a question. 

00:40:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Please. 

00:40:55
 Dr. Shapiro, I was interested in how long you think it will take for more universities to be teaching EMDR instead of it being something that professionals get after they're done with, their college education which is what we must that I'm get-- funding for. Uhm, ne-- much as we have mentors that teach us CBT or psychodynamic theory. At what point do you think EMDR is going to be something that's taught in a classroom environment? 

00:41:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Oh, I hope soon. You know it, I, I remember back when I first started developing, ah, EMDR therapy and I went to a conference, ah, where Joseph Wolpe was prepa-- presenting and he is one of the fathers of behavior therapy. And one of the things that he was saying was his lament and of how long it's take-- it was taken for behavior therapy to be accepted because all of those in power, all of those in major universities were psychodynamic. And so there was the push back from psychodynamic to behavior therapy. And then when behavior therapy came along and they were in position to power then cognitive therapy was introduced. And it took quite a while for that to be accepted and finally brought together. And now we're in a situation where CBT is the paradigm in most of the universities and it's simply gonna take a while to accept that it's okay for EMDR therapy to come along. We've had as you saw a huge amount of research and support. And it actually is in talking universities widely in Europe. We're waiting for it come back to the United States. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And, ah, and so you can fill in the blank here. How do you know who the pioneers are? 

00:42:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The ones with the arrows in their back. 

00:42:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Uh-huh, yes sir. 

00:42:55
 Ah, I'm curious if you have any comments on the effect of, uhm, difficult birth or birth trauma and the source of PTSD. Ah, because obviously that's pre-memory and obviously it's well-documented you know, both medically and in family history and stories at the past, the individuals. And I have a client whose been told many times how difficult his birth was, and, ah, has various mysterious, ah, anxiety issues. And I just wonder if there's a connection and how that might be treated? 

00:43:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, you know, thinking of a client that had just that situation, she felt guilt and blame for her mother's, ah, traumatic birth experience. She her, her, ah, feet had been caught, her ankles had been caught and also she was unable to descend usually. And how that affected for years after that included one episode of trying to commit suicide by hanging from her ankles and trying to knock her head, trying to knock herself unconscious. Uhm, the thing is, the stories of course is what you remembered but if we go back further to the early as life experiences, pre-verbal. And certainly times not necessarily birth trauma but pre-verbal trauma. And times that it's there before the child is able to develop imagery. What we find in EMDR because the memories are connected, in other words how you're responding in the present is based on this earlier life experiences. Most people don't come in and say, I want therapy because they had a terrible birth experience. They're coming in because they're not able to function in some way in the present. And we find, therefore, if you target the present situation that's causing the disturbance the processing will proceed by going into earlier memories and at times it look-- it simply the somatic shifts. It's simply the physical sensations moving in different parts of their body which for us would be indicating the pre-verbal trauma. I mean we know that these earlier life experiences are stored implicitly. You don't have to have a narrative to be able to express it, to be traumatized. So knowing that we can reach those earlier experiences through the processing has been, ah, an excellent finding for us. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't-- I don't have much for that. Ah, I-- I'm really ignorant of that particular area but I try to accept whatever metaphor the patient brings to me. And if that is the metaphor-- the per-- their prevailing metaphor I'm glad to work with it. So we have one and then two and then three. Yes. 

00:45:40
 Ah, my question is about, ah, adolescence and, ah, the efficacy of, of EMDR and, and whether there are-- there is research to show that it's been effective. 

00:45:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, the World Health Organizations has said it's supported one of the only to-- trauma fo-- CBT and EMDR therapy for the treatment of children, adolescence and adult. So it does work across the spectrum. And just a little bit more information about that where adult, ah, adolescence can usually work very well with the standard protocols, with standard procedures when you're working with children you simply-- you simplify them. And some of you also might have seen the tape that I showed earlier in the conference of, ah, treatment of, ah, ah, intellectually dis-- ah, disable child. You don't have to have the verbal in order to get the processing done. We found ways of being able to do that which means nobody needs to be left behind. 

00:46:40
 Thank you. 

00:46:40
 Ah, yes, I just had a question on the, uhm, anxiety of anticipated events as what I was understanding on the slide, is that correct that you-- can you hear me? 

00:46:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, just one more time, anticipatory anxiety? 

00:46:55
 Right. On the slide that you had it briefly - 

00:46:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:46:55
 - it, it showed you have a future event? 

00:47:00
JEFFREY ZEIG As a research? 

00:47:00
 In the EMDR slide we... 

00:47:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Anticipatory anxiety. Oh, the-- I'm sorry, the flashforwards? 

00:47:05
 Yes flashforward is that what you're saying? 

00:47:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes, yes, there is the-- yes, there is research on that, ah, that's, that's-- it was actually just developed about a couple of years ago and there are I think two or three research articles that are out on it. Ah, and, and if you look at that, uhm, research list that I have-- to my hand out is what-- is an, an opening and a long research, annotated research list. You can look at some of it there. 

00:47:35
 My question is, uhm, you know normally you-- with EMDR you're going back to the past memories - 

00:47:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yes. 

00:47:40
 - so when you're doing the flashforward how are you, how are you doing that? 

00:47:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, this is just another way of being able to use the eye movement for spot anxiety reduction. So for the general treatment of phobia or whatever it might be, you're linking back to the earliest-- the earlier memories that set the groundwork and that's why the anxiety is coming up. For some people, they are so debilitated by this intrusive imagery. It just keeps coming up, keeps coming up and they can't tell you where it ca-- where it came from. And they are so fixated on it that they're not really able to go back. You can target it directly and get an elimination and then use the rest of the procedures. 

00:48:20
 Okay, thank you. 

00:48:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, anti-- anticipatory anxiety is something that, ah, is anxiety-- about anxiety, an anxious that I'll be anxious. Uhm, anxious that if I have to speak in public, uhm, be anxious. And, ah, Viktor Frankl and I'm so blessed because I got to know and spend time with people like Viktor Frankl. And he had a way of treating it-- anticipatory anxiety using paradoxical intention. So, for example a young man would say, "I, I'm anxious about speaking to attract the women." And Vicktor Frankl would say, well, you know, you're going to a party this Friday and probably there'll be attractive women there and what I suggest that you do is that you get two champagne glasses and that you fill them to the very brim. And that you walk around the party looking for the most attractive interesting woman that you can possibly find. You know, of course you're going to be shaking, you're going to be filled with anxiety, you're going to be spilling the champagne all over yourself. But when you get to her, what I'd like you to do is to just trip and pour the champagne all over yourself and live through your worst fear. Better a moment of horror than horror without end. And this was a paradoxical intention. He never meant for the patient to actually do this but it was establishing humor and using humor to block the anticipatory anxiety. And Viktor Frankl was famous for this, ah, kind of paradoxical technique which was one of the ways that he was doing 1920s. And, ah, using paradoxical intention especially for problems of anticipatory anxiety. Yes. 

00:50:10
 Yes, I was wondering if you could comment, uhm, please on the contention that Dr. Amen that you should in fact get an image of the brain to, uhm, and reinforce your diagnosis of anxiety disorder versus brain injury. 

00:50:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, tell me because I couldn't hear. 

00:50:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO She said how do you feel about Amen's contention you should get brain damage or is it a good diagnosis... 

00:50:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, I, I, I don't-- I'm not a brain image person. I-- you know, Dr. Amen's work and I love Dr. Amen. I, I invited him to speak at the conference but you really have to ask an expert on imageries. His, his work is controversial. Then, some people think that you know, he is the answer and some people think that he is anti-answer. And so, ah, you know, you'd have to ask somebody who would really know like Dan Siegel, ah, somebody who really knows about brain imagery and knows about the science behind what Dr. Amen does. But the important thing with Dr. Amen is he gets an effect. And he's using his holistic, comprehensive approach and he, ah, uses magnetic, uhm, you know, trans-cranial magnetic ima-- ah, ah, uhm, interventions. He uses diet, as a exercise, he uses medication, he uses supplements. And, ah, some things gonna work. And he has an arsenal at his disposal that I don't have but I, I can say that, ah, he did an evaluation in 2009 at my daughter. As-- at his expense is a courtesy to me. And it was a very interesting and comprehensive assessment but the actual imagery was only a small part of it. The, the comprehensiveness of his assessment and the, the things that he ask were really interesting and helped my daughter and gave her quite a-- quite a good picture of things that she could do to help herself to surmount some of her difficulties at the time. So, I, I'm personally grateful to him but it wasn't all about the imagery. 

00:52:15
 Yes and I'm, I'm wondering can you differentiate between brain injury and anxiety, or is that something... 

00:52:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know. Ah, you know arousal... 

00:52:25
 Cuz I knew a client who was... 

00:52:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Remember Schechter's experiments. 

00:52:30
 Uh-hmm. 

00:52:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. So a classic experiment in psychology where Schechter gave students an injection of adrenalin. He didn't tell them that he was giving them adrenalin. He just told them that he was giving them a drug that would change their mood. Now, what adrenalin did is it cause it undifferentiated arousal. Well, then he put these students in a room where confederates were acting anxious. He said, "What did the drug make you feel?" They said, "Anxious." Well, he gave other students an injection of adrenalin, put them in a room where people were acting excited, happy. "What did the drug make you feel?" They said, "Happy." He put other students in, in a room where a confederates were acting angry, "What did the drug make you feel?" "Angry." Well, the drug only cause physiological arousal and the social context allowed them to define the situation according to the contextual determinants and, ah,-- you know, we should remember that and understand that we can do things that are structurally. And in some situations, anxiety is a really good thing. You know, you don't break records in practice if you're an athlete. You break records in the Olympics because for an over-learned task, high anxiety is an ideal performing state. When I was doing a demonstration this morning at eight o'clock, right, I have 500 colleagues who are watching me do therapy. Ah, I can say to you that, that therapy was better than the therapy that I would normally do in my office because for n over-learned task, high anxiety brings out the best in me. And I, I'm glad to be in a situation where I can be a peak performer because to me demonstrations in front of an audience is an over-learned task. So, I that is a high anxiety situation. I'm at my best. You know, some problems are garlic, some problems are onion. Right? So, if the problem is a gar-- is onion like depression or anxiety, well, you don't like eating an onion, you want to change. Anxiety is a motor that makes the therapy work. If the patient doesn't have anxiety, there's no impetus to change. We need anxiety. The person has to want to change. You know the joke, how many psychologist does it take to change a light bulb? One. But the light bulb has the want to change. Right? So, some problems are garlic. And problems like psychopathy and narcism, uhm, these, ah, addiction. These problems are garlic, because when you eat garlic you love it. It just that other people have to deal with the stink you know, so while you have a family whose coming in and they're terribly anxious about the father whose alcoholic but he's completely blasé. I remember one patient who came into my office, he was referred by a friend. He was a crack salesman, a wonderful salesman crack as a, of course a, ah, huf-- ah, ah, upon the hear because the patient came in and he's going, and he has white powder on his nose. He, he did a line of cocaine before he came into his office and this was the presenting problem was that he was using cocaine at work. Now, no therapy was going to happen because that patient was feeling better than I was. If the patient is feeling better than the therapist, no therapy is going to happen. Please. We have time for one more question. 

00:56:15
 Hi. Is there a particular client that you would refer for EMDR versus hypnosis and vice versa? 

00:56:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, I... 

00:56:25
 It's-- I have one that refers, ah, an EMDR specialist that refers to me for hypnosis but honestly I would know what one look like to refer for EMDR. 

00:56:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well... 

00:56:40
JEFFREY ZEIG If the patient had PTSD I would be glad to find a-- an EMDR therapist. And if it was specially you know, a difficult and complex PTSD, ah, I'm, I'm great at you know, seeing patients from other therapist and a consultation and sending patients of mine for a consultations with other therapist who can help them with circumscribed areas than so I, I'm a great believer I, ah, in what Francine represents in, in the EMDR I, I had no problem. 

00:57:10
 So are you-- are you saying PTSD would be best to refer for EMDR? 

00:57:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, there but-- if it like this. There's most research supporting PTSD, there's additional research with all the other anxiety disorders. There's research now and depression. There's some research coming up and, and showing change in psychotic symptoms. There is some, uhm, published reports on the treatment of, uhm, olfactory reference syndrome and body dysmorphic disorder. In other words, again, we're, we're pretty well looking across the board in terms of, uhm, that needs this on processed memories that are pushing the various disorders. 

00:57:50
 All right. 

00:57:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO But different amount research support for a different case so far. 

00:57:55
 Thank you. 

00:57:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, thanks to all of you and thanks to Francine. I think it was really interesting. I hope you found it interesting I, I certainly did. 

00:58:05
