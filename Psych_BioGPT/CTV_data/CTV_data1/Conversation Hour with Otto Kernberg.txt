OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. Ah, can you hear me now? Okay. This is called, ah, conversation. It's one hour in which you can raise all kind of questions and I'll try to answer them as much as I can. Uhm, ah, so, uhm, ah, fortunately, we are, ah, relatively small groups so you also to have a chance, and, uhm, ah, very feel free to ask whatever you want to. I follow the general principle that there are no indiscreet questions, there only indiscreet answers. So, I have to watch it. Uhm, and I have to confess to you that I have a hearing difficulty that affects particularly, ah, the frequencies of microphones. So, I've asked the volunteer, Ms. Calcaterra(ph), ah, to please, uhm, summarize to me, or repeat the questions that you have raised, and I had difficulty understanding. So that, that should-- that should work. And, ah, if you can't quite understand, ask them to repeat it. Uhm, ah, ah, I, I think that, that should work. If it doesn't, we'll fix it on the road. Uhm, it's, ah, shortly past eight and we have un-- until nine o'clock. So, uhm, it's up to you. There some microphone there, uhm, you can raise your questions there. And I wonder even whether if you talk loudly, or might do it from your seat, I can't judge that, but in another case, uhm, there's a microphone. 

00:01:45
 I wonder if I get a background as to why you got into the profession in the first place and how that happen. 

00:01:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. Uhm, by the way, I can't hear you perfectly. Well, I have, ah, ah,-- it's a-- the microphones that get me disorganized. Uhm, I got into the profession gradually, uhm, in, ah, my childhood. Ah, I have an uncle who was, ah, world famous psychiatrist, Manfred Sakel. He discovered the insulin coma treatment for schizophrenia, that was the only treatment for schizophrenia in his time. And, uhm, he was used by my mother for any educational programs that, ah, she had with me. And so, she would take me to his, uhm, clinic. And, and I was terribly afraid of him. Uhm, later, he, uhm, immigrated to United States, developed his own, ah, service and foundation in, in Boston. My parents and I immigrated to Chile. I was a child, after the, ah, occupation of Austria by the Germans, by the Nazis. I was born in Vienna, Austria. I lived in Chile. I was interested in, in medicine. Uhm, I studied medicine at the University of Chile. And, uhm, during my adolescence, I came under the influence of a number of immigrated psychoanalysts who-- that kind of Austrian, uhm, psychoanalyst. Ah, I was about 15 and, ah, she had a kind of, ah, motherly attitude toward me. And, ah, uhm, there was an older man who found to youth group of immigrants, and, he was a Jungian analyst. So, I am-- and I've read Freud, uhm, when I was 17. And then, in medical school, at first, I was became interested in gastroenterology, ah, then, I shifted to neurology and then to psychiatry under the influence of Ignacio Matte Blanco a great psychiatrist and the founder of the psychological institute and society in Chile. So, these things came together gradually. And, ah, so I am-- I went into-- I trained in psychiatry and simultaneously in psychoanalysis. And, uhm, right to it at from psychiatric residency and from psychology training, and, uhm, I became interested in research, research in psychotherapy very early. I felt I was limited in what I could develop in Chile, I came to the United States. First on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, and then, eventually to the Menninger Foundation, Topeka, Kansas. And, ah, so I became, uhm, introvert into New York, Columbia University and then, Cornell University. Uhm, so I became gradually, uhm, clinical psychiatrist, medical director of psychiatric hospitals, and psychoanalysts and training analyst. So, it, it happened kind of by itself, not that I had a plan ahead of time, just one thing followed, ah, retrospectively. It seemed to have happened much more by itself rather than by conscious decision-making. That's my answer to your question. Uhm, I would like to ask that if, if I had to do it all over again, I would do the same thing. So, I'm-- I'm happy with what I'm doing, which I think is very lucky because I know many people who feel if, ah,-- if I could start again, I would do something differently. In fact, during my adolescence, I thought maybe I'll become a field director. Uhm, I didn't know that it's a dream nowadays for, for about 50% of adolescents. 

00:06:10
[sil.] 

00:06:15
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yes. 

00:06:15
 Ah, I have a simple question. Uhm, I haven't heard you speak much about the role of... 

00:06:20
OTTO F. KERNBERG I need you. Sure. Yeah. 

00:06:20
 Ah, I haven't heard you speak much yet, yet about the role of, uhm, substance abuse in, in, uhm, borderline patients, uhm, specifically, I'm think about, ah, the role reversal that you speak of, uhm, victim persecutory whether substance used plays a close role in that dynamic? 

00:06:45
MS. CALCATERRA She is wondering if you could speak, uhm, the role of substance abuse in, uhm, personality disorders? 

00:06:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. Yeah. Uhm, substance abuse is, uhm, is a frequent, ah, complication in, ah, severe personality disorders. In fact, uhm, with any patients who, uhm, ah, present substance abuse, and I'm including here both abuse and dependency, it's, ah, very important to evaluate personality structure because the prognosis for treatment depends more than on anything else on the severity of the personality disorder. The mild or the personal disorder or absent personality disorder, the better, the prognosis. Ah, let's assume, we have a severe personality disorder and, uhm, with substance abuse, and, uhm,-- so there are-- there are two strategies that have to develop simultaneously. First, the treatment of substance abuse that has to stop the treatment, that's absolutely first priority. And second, what kind of psychotherapeutic approach, uhm, uhm, cognitive behavioral psychodynamic. And my experience is mostly with psychodynamic approach is with transference-focused psychotherapy the specific treatment for severe personality disorder that we have developed in mind institute. Uhm, our approach would be to stop simultaneously, uhm, intensive psychotherapy and treatment of the substance abuse by specialists in substance abuse. If the patient is abusing substances but not dependent, it is possible that with a treatment contract for intensive psychotherapy, substance abuse may stop and you don't need specialized treatment. This not-- or, so you've thrived it out. Can you make by contract the patient stopping the use of drugs. If that's not possible then, there has to be simultaneous treatment by, uhm, ah, ah, specialists in that regard. Uhm, if the patient has, uhm, antisocial features, you can't trust, dishonors it, then you have to, uhm, establish social controls contact with family or other people who can observe the patient, you have to get the right, uhm, at, at the beginning of the treatment that you can't contact people at work, at school, at home to make sure that the patient is not telling you stories, uhm, and the patient has to accept that. So, you established by contract, a social structure that checks on, on, on truth. You'd only to do that in patients who are absolutely reliable and, uhm, well, this is not a problem. So treatment depends on that. Uhm, and you interpret the dynamics of the use of the drug, ah, within the treatment in terms of its reflection of transference development. So, you forbid the use of drugs and simultaneously interpret what that means to the patient, what it implies in terms of the relationship between patient and therapist. Uhm, that works pretty well, uhm, ah, in-- including setting up the contracts, if the patient breaks the contract, the treatment would come to an end but one gives the patient a second chance. We always give the patient a second chance but-- meaning, patient has broken the contract, continue the treatment in spite of what we've set up by contract at the beginning. But at that point, we, we, in-- introduce into each session the power that patient has given himself, or given one part of him that's trying to destroy the treatment, to destroy it immediately by going back to the drug so that the treatment is hanging by a threat and we, uhm, bring the fact that the treatment is hanging by a threat up session by session, by session, by session until it is really clear that this is no longer an issue. We do this with all contract breaks severe societal that, ah, the tax, etcetera. So, uhm, that's in a natural for substance abuse. If the patient is substance dependent, then in all cases, he needs an expert in, in, ah, substance abuse then, then it has to be a dual arrangement between intensive psychotherapy and the, the substance abuse treatment. And that means first, ah, detoxification, if necessarily, uhm, uhm, by impatient treatment, then, rehabilitation, usual reha-- rehabilitation for drug abuse, then, continuation of outpatient treatment. So, he has to go to a strict protocol. If it's an alcoholic patient, strict protocol with the use of a, a, uhm, medication, uhm, ah, the support system set up by the treatment of alcoholism. This is not incompatible with an intensive psychotherapeutic approach, and that works. Again, ah, the prognosis depends to quite an extent to the severity of the personality disorder particularly the presence of, ah, antisocial features. In general, for all psychotherapist, the two prognostic, or the most important elements are severity of antisocial features and secondary gain of illness. The patient obtaining some kind of advan-- takes advantages of the fact that is not functioning well. That's not specific for people with, with drug abuse, but it's a general issue. But antisocial behavior becomes extremely important, ah, for patients with drug abuse. If the patient have the worst case of antisocial behavior which is the antisocial personality proper, antisocial personality in this trick sense, the prognosis for psychotherapeutic treatment is practically zero. So that, we have to protect the family and society, but there's nothing you can do for the patient, and one has to be aware there are patients who can't be treated, who won't respond. Not every-- not every patient can't be helped with kind of delusion. Yes. 

00:14:05
 I'll try to have right-- can you hear me? 

00:14:05
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yes, I can hear you. 

00:14:10
 Uhm, I have a theoretical question. Uhm, I understand that defensive have difficulty theory of about coming to the consciousness. Ah, I am-- and particularly in, in transference and phenomenons like, ah, cancer and synchronous cancers are ought to interpersonal. I have trouble understanding the difference between complementary counter-transference and projective identification. 

00:14:40
OTTO F. KERNBERG The difference between projective identification and the-- and what, the other? 

00:14:45
 Uhm, complementary counter-transference, sir. 

00:14:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. And, and, and complementary counter-transference, yeah. A very good question. Uhm, they are intimately related. Uhm, the exact definition of, ah, projective identification, which is a very important prevalent defensive operation at the level of severe personality disorders, is to attribute to the other person what the patient can't tolerate in himself, to unconsciously try to induce in the other person that for the patient is accusing him off, to control the other person, ah, so that it doesn't become dangerous under the effect of that projected emotion. And the patient maintains empathy at the same time with how it feels the way he has used the other person feels. So, it's projection, induction, control and empathy. That in contract-- in contrast to higher level of projection in which one attributes something to another person that one cannot sense in oneself, that one hates it in the other person but as long as one is rid off that at a person, one is free of the program. Patients with a more primitive form of projective identification, uhm, are prosecuted by that all the time. And to give you an illustration, ah, the, ah, patients who have the hatred for homosexuals, or, or get, "As long as there is no homosexual in the society, I feel fine. Homosexual, waah?" They have no homosexual control feeling, but at the bottom, if they have that intense reaction because they'll trying to vote off something deep inside and come tolerate. That's a higher level of, of, of projection. Projective identification usually deals with intense aggression and the patient already behaves, uhm, ah, in the middle of recession, uhm, you asked a question, and the patient tells you, "Oh, why did you ask that question? What does it mean?" You'll say, "Well, I'm trying to get information." "No, no, I, I want to know the real reason. Something that's not quite right with this, and there is something about your attitude which is kind of-- uhm, is it that you don't like me, or you have against me? Can you please be, be quite honest about that?" You see, there is somebody who is attributing bad intention to the therapist, or really behaving in a provocative way, try to control the therapist and you can sense that she knows how it feels when one is in rage, this projective identification. Now, projective identification either attribution and the induction tends to induce complementary identification of the counter-transference so that complementary identification and the counter-transference identifying with that, what the patient can tolerate is a very natural product of projective identification to the extent that some authors included as part of the definition of projective identification. I think that's a mistake because very often, the therapist is not, ah, ah, influenced and, and maintains his internal cool. So, I think that's an advantage in, ah, differentiating the two but they are clinically very often, ah, related, one being the consequence of the other. 

00:18:55
 Thank you. 

00:19:00
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yes. 

00:19:00
 Uhm, my question is about, ah, you know, what the future of, ah, psychoanalysis. You became a psychoanalyst in a quite different time that we're living now, with all the medications in the market, insurance companies controlling, uhm, payment. Ah, what do you think is gonna happen to the future of psychoanalysis, ah, in this country? 

00:19:20
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah. Uhm... 

00:19:25
 Can you repeat the question, please? 

00:19:25
 Yeah. We can't hear the question. 

00:19:25
OTTO F. KERNBERG Uhm, uhm, I-- okay. Repeat your question, yeah. Okay. 

00:19:30
 My question was about the future of psychoanalysis in this country with, uhm, ah, with all the, uhm, medications in the market, with all the insurance companies controlling payment. Ah, you became as psychoanalyst quite a different time that we're living now. What's gonna happen to the future of this, ah, field? 

00:19:55
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah. Uhm, I, uhm, I, I think you point to, ah, ah, general, social, political, economic problem that, ah, all funding agencies, insurance agency, federal agency, state agencies are reluctant to support long-term intensive psychotherapeutic treatment. It's expensive and they prefer to support, ah, short-term psychotherapy, uhm, or medication. Ah, so that, that social political economic pressure is to reduce length of treatment, reduce psychotherapist to a minimum duration, uhm, ah, increase, ah, replacement of psychotherapeutic treatment by, by medication. So this pressurize universal, ah, not only this country but all through the, ah, the western world. And, uhm, uhm, I think will probably continue until some kind of equilibrium is reached. I'm gonna explain what I mean by equilibrium. In the-- I think we have abundant clinical evidence that there are certain type of illnesses of patients that I helped more of the psychoanalysis than any other kind of treatment. Some, not-- psychoanalysis, not, ah, been a zeal, ah, and, uhm, we have learned that, ah, psychoanalysis can be perfectly replaced either by this intensive psychotherapist, uhm, particularly there are many, many cognitive behavioral psychotherapists would deal with many symptoms that traditionally used to be, ah, treated by psychoanalysis, uhm, medication has a limited place, etcetera. And I think that in the long run, this realistic differentiation who needs what treatment is going to occupy and accept that place in, in medicine and, uhm, psychological care. If and when it is based by solid evidence, I think that evidence based practice in the long run will have an, an impact on what society is funding or not. In other words, that there are limit to the extent to which insurance companies and government can deny the importance of certain treatment if, ah, overwhelming research demonstrates the country. So this is-- so I think that in point of equilibrium will be reached when the psychotherapeutic establishment bring us the importance of, uhm, objective criteria for what is needed on the basis of research. This is already true for-- in the field mostly of cognitive behavioral therapist that in venereal, ah, brief psychotherapist, there are, uhm, techniques that are easier to be standardized, to be researched. So there is a-- cognitive behavioral therapist have an enormous advantage in being accepted as fineable and funded, uhm, treatments. There is-- ah, psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapist have been much slower in this regard. Psychoanalytic psychotherapists are beginning to go that road, and there's empirical evidence for the effectiveness of long-term psychology psychotherapist subsidence transference-focused psychotherapist that would develop the mindset. It's not the only one. Mentali-- mentalization based therapy has had that demonstration. Uhm, psychoana-- psychoanalysis has achieved itself the status in Germany by massive research carried out joint about psychoanalytic institutions now. In general, in, in most part of the world including the United States, psychoanalytic institutes have been terribly reluctant of carrying out research, it's not part of their tradition. I think that's a self-destructive, self-defeating limitations of psychology education that is, ah, hamming psychoanalysis and, ah,-- and evidently, ah, the importance of psychoanalysis is shrinking because it's not being funded, it's expensive long term and only limited segment of the population can afford it. So, I think that this is a, a cri-- social crisis for psychoanalysis of which should-- will come out if and when, uhm, it takes the road of serious research which in the case of psychoanalysis complicate the long-term treatment with-- ah, complicate the, uhm, ah, learning process as involved will take time and it's difficult, but it's an essential task. So, practically, psychoanalysis has reduced its indications at this point, reduced its influence, its utilization, and that's effecting it and its morale seriously, uhm, and at the same time constitutes significant task. On the other hand, psychoanalysis has to its-- in its favor that it represents the most in-depth and comprehensive analysis of unconscious motivation, technical interventions and, and their forfeits knowledge and experience through the psychology psychotherapist. So, it's like, uhm, kind of basic psychological science within the field of psychoanal-- psychotherapist. Ah, so I see, ah, reduced practical influence of psychoanalysis, serious challenge, ah, definite role for psychology psychotherapist but with an overwhelming utilization for long period of time of cognitive behavior on where we're ahead of the game. That's in a natural, how I, I would put it. Uhm, I don't know whether I'm answering your question. Yeah. 

00:26:30
 I was fascinated in your presentation on transference-based psychotherapy, you know, that you commented that about 18% of patients have also a concurrent bipolar disorder. Now, since there's a very strong shift in affect state between idealization and the paranoid devaluation, ah, in certain object relations. How do you establish the criteria on ego psychological terms or object relations terms for coexistence of a bipolar disorder when you already have reason for very intense frequent and primitive shifts in affect just because of the distortion and certain object relations? 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:20
OTTO F. KERNBERG Uhm, if you-- if you repeat that-- uhm, if you can repeat that, I would appreciate it. 

00:27:25
 In, in your presentation, uhm, on transference-based psychotherapy, you mentioned that about 16 to 18% of patients have bipolar disorder in the west. 

00:27:35
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yes. 

00:27:35
 But, since in the shifts between idealization and devaluation in the domain of certain object relations we have, very intense primitive affect states oscillating from idealization and devaluation from impression to euphoria. How do you establish the criteria for the concurrent existence of bipolar disorder when you already have enough phenomenology to explain it just based on the certain object relations. 

00:28:05
OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. I understand. Okay. 

00:28:05
 Because I see so many people labeled bipolar disorder to have a borderline personality organization, and I don't think that that's correct. 

00:28:10
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah, yeah. Okay. Uhm, there are several, several questions involved here. First of all, as you said about 15% of patients with borderline personality disorder present at the same time in bipolar disorder. Uhm, this is practically very over-exaggerated because people wrongly make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder when the patient doesn't have it. There are certain diagnoses which are made wrongly so frequently that every time a patient come with the diagnosis once start reviewing all the data. That's true for bipolar disorder-- I, I worked within a hospital so I'm talking about what happens with hospitalized patients which are the most severely ill. Bipolar disorder is over-diagnosed, major depression or major affective illness is over-diagnosed, ADHD is over-diagnosed, PTSD is over-diagnosed, those are fashionable diagnoses. They also avoid the diagnosis of personality disorder which very often is not funded by the insurance agency while these disorders are funded and the hospital manipulates all they get-- their money off. So, first point, you have to make an accurate diagnosis. It can be done in practically old cases. I'm not going into detail, but an experience condition can differentiate a case that presents a bipolar disorder from on the thousands. It, it's not-- it, it's-- it's-- it's relatively simple with sufficient, ah, education training. If the patient has a bipolar disorder, that's has an indication for medication treatment. The treatment of bipolar disorder is medication, is mood stabilizing a sophisticated moods, stabilizing, ah, treatment. So, that-- regardless of what, what the personality disorder is, if there's a bip-- an active bipolar disorder medication, mood stabilizing medication. If it is not active, but the patient has had episodes, hypomanic or depressive episode, he may need maintenance medication that prevents new episodes. So sophisticated treatment mean adequate, consistence, ah, maintained medication treatment. Then, what you're left with is the personality disorder and that you'll treat according to what it means. Third part of your question, idealization and devaluation. There's a difference between idealization and devaluation as defensive operations and high and low mood activation. So, if the patient has, uhm, euphoric mood as part of a bipolar disorder, you have to treat that mood, uhm, and you cannot-- uhm, you cannot translate that into a particular defensive operation. Same as the patient is, uhm, is severely depressed and, and self-devaluing-- self-devaluation there is, is the manifestation of the severity of depression. So, the mood is although has to be normalized and then, so on, on a-- on a euthymic mood background of the kind of, uhm,-- the kind of alternating instability of moods that's typical for personality disorder. But if does not diagnose bipolar disorder then, you can, ah, diagnose the defensive operations that show in the patient's cognitive, uhm, operations and in his behavior. So, that, that would be my, my answer. Uhm, good diagnosis, appropriate treatment of the bipolar disorder, ah, to op-- to clean the fields to know what's the-- how severely personality disorder. There are some cases where very stout because there is such oscillation of affect that you want-- that is to say rapid cycling individual. Usually by starting the symptoms over an extended period of time that can be clarified, but another element is that if, if, if purely bipolar disorder may coincide with emotional maturity in one's relationship, their patients, uhm, uhm, who fall from periods of high moods to low moods of the relationships with others maintained depth. In contrast, severe personality disorder show infantile, immature levels of behavioral way even they are in their mood, and that also helps the differential diagnosis. 

00:33:30
 Thank you. 

00:33:30
OTTO F. KERNBERG You're welcome. 

00:33:30
 Ah, my question is about the ideology of - 

00:33:35
OTTO F. KERNBERG I need you. 

00:33:35
 - uhm, borderline personality disorder. Particularly, uhm, any research or evidence, uhm, regarding traumatic birth and the, ah, attachment issues, uhm, following birth. And literally, right after the birth of the child, if due to medical reasons, uhm, the child is taken from the mother, ah, to, ah,-- in ICUs, or something like that, and the mother is not even to born with the child immediately after birth. Uhm, is there any link or research with that in the development of borderline personality disorder? And then, also, uhm, the prevalence of borderline personality disorder in men, is it the same rate as in, in females? Or is it just misdiagnosed? 

00:34:25
MS. CALCATERRA Uhm, traumatic birth and then, its effect on attachment. 

00:34:30
OTTO F. KERNBERG Pardon. 

00:34:30
MS. CALCATERRA Uhm, he wants to know about the difference between traumatic birth and the effects of attachment, if, uhm, the baby was taken from the mother and put in ICU. And does it cause... 

00:34:40
OTTO F. KERNBERG Between what-- between traumatic, what? 

00:34:45
MS. CALCATERRA Traumatic birth and, uhm,-- between, uhm, attachment. 

00:34:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Trau-- did you say traumatic birth? 

00:34:55
MS. CALCATERRA Uhm-hmm. 

00:34:55
 Maybe you can repeat the question, is it okay? 

00:35:00
OTTO F. KERNBERG Is it... 

00:35:00
 Uhm, traumatic birth in which the infant due to the traumatic birth is not able to be with the mother and maybe is, you know, taken in ICU, and the mother does not have the opportunity to home the child right after the birth, gone with the child. Uhm, in the moments and the hours after birth, is there any, uhm, evidence suggest that leads to increase, uhm, rate, uhm, involving about, ah, borderline personality disorder? And also, uhm, is the-- is the, the rate of diagnosis in men and women are the same, or is it hundred diagnosed in men? 

00:35:45
OTTO F. KERNBERG In-- wha-- the, the rate of borderline personality disorder? Okay. So there are two different questions. At first, regarding traumatic birth or, uhm, attachment doesn't operate in, in hours and in days, it's a process that occurs over weeks and month. So, there is no reason why, ah, baby that has to be separated for the first two days or even weeks, ah, because of severe medical complications of baby or mother cannot develop normal attachment once the, the relationship normalizes. Of course, if there is no mothering person during an extended period of time, three months and more time, then, that, uhm, may have significant impact, but that is a different situation. And, uhm, ah, ah, the whole attachment process is a slow gradual process of the first few month of life, and babies have an enormous capacity to adjust to different kind of environment. So, uhm, it is, uhm-- ah, the, the consistency often available maternal figure is what is important, not the amount of time or, ah, or separation very often. Ah, mothers, ah, have the sense, they have to stay home of the first six months of the baby before they go back to work. It may be preferable that they go back to work early when the baby gets used to a different schedule rather than having an abrupt change in, in the total schedule. The availability of a good mother-infant relationship, regularity and predictability, uhm, are the key element, not, not the amount of time, uhm, involved. And, uhm, uhm, brief crisis have no major impact. That's very different. If the baby has a severe painful illness in the first year of life, uhm, illness with chronic pain that tends to increase negative affect and-- of negative affect response that may have an influence on, on development, but that's already a very special case. 

00:38:20
 I'm gonna... 

00:38:20
OTTO F. KERNBERG The other question is about the difference, ah, between, ah, men and wo-- probably the incidence of borderline personality disorder are the same. The symptom-- the symptoms are different. Uhm, in men, uhm, the, the manifestation of the predominance of severe negative affect are usually directed outside in, ah, in regressive, uhm, uhm, impulsive, uhm, destructive behavior. In, in women, it's tended-- tends to be more directed inside in the form of, ah, a depressive, ah, self-mutilating-- self-devaluing behavior. And aggression is directed more toward the inside than toward the outside so that different manifestations and that, uhm, that-- than clinically, uhm, ah, ah, may show us, uhm, predominance of antisocial behavior in men, predominance of self-defeating behavior in women. To some extent, this is culturally forced out. So, double sexual morality forced us, ah, in, in traditional, ah, patriarchal societies. Men have a sexual freedom than women don't have. And, uhm, uhm, very often, women become victimized by that power differential and therefore, masochistic self-defeating behaviors in women show very often was at, at proneness to unhappy love affairs or string-- eternal string of unhappy love affairs. In men, uhm, self-defeating masochistic behavior shows much more in their relation to work which is an, ah, indispensable, uhm, demand more of men than of women in our culture. So, men tend to if they have submissive self-defeating behavior tend to show that in work, they stay in impossible work situation, that women would walk away from. So masochistic behaviors of men show in the relationship to, to work condition. In women, it shows more frequently in relation to love situation. That's not absolute. And I'm, ah, I'm just talking what relative frequent is. So, cultural influences, uhm, ah, influence, the form, that, uhm, personality disorders take. 

00:41:05
 Next. 

00:41:05
 Dr. Kernberg, could you speak something about the difference between transference and counter-transference, and transference-focused psychotherapy and the relational psychotherapy. 

00:41:15
 Please go to the microphone. 

00:41:20
 Particularly, the differences in complicated learning processes in each one. 

00:41:25
OTTO F. KERNBERG If you-- come a little lower and talk a little louder. 

00:41:30
 Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't... 

00:41:30
OTTO F. KERNBERG No, no, that's okay. 

00:41:30
 Uhm, could you speak about, ah, the differences, ah, in complicated learning processes in... 

00:41:40
OTTO F. KERNBERG In complicated what? 

00:41:40
 What you called-- you mentioned the term, complicated learning processes. 

00:41:45
OTTO F. KERNBERG Learning processes? 

00:41:45
 Yeah. What happens in the client in transference-based psychotherapy and relational psychotherapy about the differences, and what happens in the clients learning in each one? 

00:42:00
OTTO F. KERNBERG In relational therapy in co-- in comparison with what? 

00:42:00
 With what you do. 

00:42:05
OTTO F. KERNBERG Okay. 

00:42:05
 Would you like to.. 

00:42:05
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll repeat the question in case you have not-- if, uhm,-- the, the question is what are the difference of the management of transference, counter-transference and, ah, and transference-focused psychotherapy, and I might as well add to that, transference-focused psychotherapy and, uhm, mainstream classical psychoanalysis, on the one hand in relational analysis, and relational psychotherapy on the other. That's the question. What are the differences-- I understand. 

00:42:45
 And what happens... 

00:42:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG The, the differences in management of transference and counter-transference I would say that the main difference is that-- the, the main differences are that, in relational psychoanalysis, uhm, the assumption is that, that transference is already in part, uhm, rela-- ah, consequence, uhm, of the counter-transference so that it is not only that counter-transference of the therapist is a consequence of the patient's transference. But there's a reciprocal relation and the patient's transference is already in part derived from the therapist's counter-transference in addition to being derived, of course, from the patient's unconscious past. So, the relation is therapist see much more mutual induction of transferences and countertransferences, ah, in the patient-therapist relation. Therefore, they tend to analyze transference developments, not only from the viewpoint what's the unconscious past of the patient that's activated the here and now, but to what extent is the patient's transference, a consequence of behaviors of the therapist. And if the therapist thinks that his counter-transference has contributed to the transference developments, he shares that information with the patient in order to reduce that elements that has brought about transference, ah, developments. So in short, in relational psychoanalysis and, and psychology psychotherapy, therapists tend to share some of their counter-transferences, some of their counter-transference reactions with the patients and see the origin of regressive behavior relatively, more in the present relationship than a repetition of unconscious relations from the past. In addition, they believe that this new experience of the patient in relating to a therapist who behaves so differently from the original transference object has an important therapeutic function. The improvement occurs as much by the effect of the new experience in the patient-therapist relationship than-- because of the resolution of unconscious conflict from the past. In contrast, in transference-focused psychotherapy and, uhm, ah, ah, classical or, uhm, mainstream analysis, the assumption is, if the patient-- if the therapist has behavior that contributes to induce transference regression, that's the problem of the therapist. The therapist has to observe that, correct that and, ah, it's not helpful to share that with the patient because that would reduce the intensity of transference developments. Not everything is transference in the classical view. If, if the therapist has inappropriate behaviors and the patient reacts to that perfectly, logically, that's not transference, it's the realistic way in which the patient reacts. So one has to differentiate problems caused by the therapist, that the therapist has to resolve by himself and the activation of the unconscious part so that in their classical and transference-focused tradition, counter-transference is not communicated, but only used for transference analysis. And, and the assumption is that the most important therapeutic feature is the analysis and resolution of the transference. And the impact, the positive impact of the therapist's personality is a consequence of the patients free-- getting free from the distortions of his perceptions of the therapist under the influence of the transference. Normally, we all influence each other and we all help each other that more-- the sicker the patient, the less she has that capacity to benefit from a good induction with others because it tends to distort it so much, and transference analysis reduces that distortion significantly. That's-- that's in a natural the difference. 

00:48:15
 And my question is, do you know any training program in Asian co-- ah, in Asian countries, ah, the training on psychoa-- psychoanalyst-- analyst? 

00:48:25
MS. CALCATERRA Do you know, uhm, any training programs in Asia-- Asian countries for psychoanalyst? 

00:48:30
OTTO F. KERNBERG Uhm, training programs for psychoanalyst in Asian countries, yes. There are, uhm, several psychology institutes and societies in Japan, uhm, there is, ah, psychoanalytic society and institute in, uhm, in South Korea, in Seoul, uhm, and there are beginning psychology institutes in, uhm, Beijing, in Shanghai, in China. Uhm, that's, ah, that's, ah, following Asia, and the, ah, and the Middle East, there are psychoanalytic institutions in, uhm, uhm, in Turkey, in Israel, in Lebanon, uhm, that basically as far as I know in the Middle East. There used to be psychology centers in India, but it is, uhm, not that we can-- I, I-- where I have no information in recent times, and, and the same is true for Egypt. 

00:50:10
 Yes. Uhm, yesterday, uhm, the, the issue of scientism in relationship to, ah, neuroscience and, and, uhm, uhm, ah, ah, psychoanalysis, ah, was, was brought up. Uhm, my question, you know, it is one which addresses the scientism part to that, ah, with scientism being defined as, uhm, the fundamental idolatry of science and, and scientific methodology as a god. Ah, so, I'm getting now to the foundational principle of, of psychoanalysis and psychoanalysis being, ah, ah, defined as foundationally based upon biological determinism, ah, and you mentioned that, you know, these ideas came out of Germany and, and that's true. Ah, so, uhm, what then is the difference between biological determinism of psychoanalysis and the biological determinism of the foundational basis of Nazism. 

00:51:35
OTTO F. KERNBERG Can you... 

00:51:40
 Come, come again. 

00:51:40
 We had a lot of background, I don't wanna get you even now. 

00:51:40
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah. Can you repeat your question, please? 

00:51:50
 Yesterday, the issue of scientism was brought up and we were cautioned not to men-- or analysis and discussion of neuroscience become, ah, scientism which is the worship of science even though scientific methodology is just a methodology among many methodologies. And with the foundational basis of psychoanalysis being biological determinism, if we are to guard again scientism particularly state-sponsored scientism, what is the difference then between psychoanalysis, the biological determinism of psychoanalysis and the fundamental philosophical biological determinism of Nazism, if there is a difference. 

00:52:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Uhm, the, the question is what's the different-- the difference between the scientific foundation of psychoanalysis as based in the biological sciences on the one hand and on the other, the what? The, the Naz-- the ideology of Nazism? 

00:53:05
 Not, no-- we were-- I don't know if this is wrong. 

00:53:10
OTTO F. KERNBERG Is it... 

00:53:15
 Oh, okay. 

00:53:15
OTTO F. KERNBERG Can you hear-- yeah, yes. 

00:53:15
 We were cautioned yesterday in the morning-- in, in the morning presentation on some of the scientific, ah, ah, research associated with neuroscience, and we were cautioned not to let that become scientism, which is the worship of science by definition, the worship of science in scientific methodology as a god, that science itself becomes a god in replacement of God. Okay? So, extrapolating that warning, what then is the difference between the foundational basis of psychoanalysis which is defined as being biological determinism and the foundational basis of Nazism which has a foundational basis of biological determinism also as sanctioned by the state. And I was really glad that you brought this up, about these ideas came out of Germany. So, I wanna thank you for that. Unfortunately, the mindset of Germany has, I believed, infected a lot of our universities here. So, if you could make a comment about that. 

00:54:45
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:45
 I had appreciate it. 

00:54:50
OTTO F. KERNBERG Yeah. Uhm, I, I think that, uhm, uhm, we have a difference between, uhm, the scientific methodology and the development of natural science on the one hand and the utilization of a scientific knowledge for the development of ideological, ah, postures and systems. And, uhm, I think that, ah, uhm, the issue is not that such ideological systems of based upon science, but they're based upon a distortion and, ah, very often, the willful ideological distortion of science beyond its territory. Uhm, ah, science cannot answer, uhm, ideological questions and ideological positions, uhm, ah, may use falsely scientific, uhm, ah, assumptions about, ah, usually can be exposed rather easily. Ah, science cannot answer the question of theology which has an ideological implication, the existence of God cannot be demonstrated, or is nonexistent cannot be demonstrated it seems to me by, by scientific thinking. These are different independent realms of knowledge. Uhm, so, and when it comes to Nazism, that's a beautiful illustration of it, totally anti-scientific, a scientific ideological development that had not a shadow, ah, a thread of relation to real science. Although, of course, it was, uhm, ah, proposed by the state and the official ideology that it was strictly scientific. Same as Marxism was considered, ah, science and, uhm, dialectic Marxism, a scien-- scientific, ah, ah, ah,-- a scientific discipline. I think we have abundant evidence that that's totally falls. Ah, so that our task is to differentiate ideological systems and their misuse and distortion of science from the realm of science including the knowledge of the limitation of science which cannot be the basis I think for ideological systems, religious political. Or otherwise, this is, ah,-- so, so, I, I didn't hear what was said yesterday in morning, I don't know whether what I'm saying is, uhm, in contradiction or not to it, but in any case, ah, I think that's, ah, ah,-- if we have more time that could be illustrated with any ideological system that pretends to be based on science. Usually, they all pretend to be based on science that, uhm, that gives a very elegant dressing to what, uhm, uhm, philosophical postulates that don't have a scientific basis. And in term, scientists, serious, totally committed scientists may end up in very different ideological systems, practically. I know psychoanalysts who are deeply religious, and others who are convinced atheist. I, I think that it's fine as long as neither of them tries to derive his ideological position from the scientific tenants of psychoanalysis because that's-- leads always to, to, to a distortion. So, it's an interesting question. Ah, if psychoanalyst-- if psychoanalyst-- oh, no, no, don't clap-- uhm, uhm, a very distinguished psychoanalyst, Wilfred Bion, suggested that we have three major vertices to looking at reality that are mutuality incompatible and cannot be reduced to each other. The scientific vertex aiming for truth, uhm, the religious vertex, uhm, aiming for value and goodness, and the aesthetic vertex aiming for beauty. So, that goodness beauty and truth are mutually, they can go together but they cannot be reduced to each other. You cannot derive one from the other, he suggests. I think that's an interesting thought. Uhm, and, uhm, uhm, it's nine o'clock. On this thought, we can't continue. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. Okay.
