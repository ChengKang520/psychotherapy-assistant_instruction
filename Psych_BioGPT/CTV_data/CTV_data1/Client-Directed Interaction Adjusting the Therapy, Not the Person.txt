BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT 

00:01:05
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:05
and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:25
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

00:02:00
JON CARLSON Hi. I'm Jon Carlson. I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:10
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest, ah, Scott Miller, who's going to talk to us about his approach to brief therapy. Scott, how would you define brief therapy? 

00:02:20
SCOTT MILLER Well, in fact, ah, it's my, my sense right now that brief therapy, the whole notion of brief therapy, is a bit of a muddle. Uhm, I don't really think there is any such thing as brief therapy. I, I think that that's because there's no such thing as long-term therapy. Clients typically attend five, six, eight visits. That hasn't changed, ah, since the 1940s and since the advent and popularity of brief therapy models. I just think there's therapy the way most clients use it. That's what I try to do. 

00:02:45
DIANE KJOS And, and what do you call the form of therapy that you do? 

00:02:50
SCOTT MILLER Well, that's, in fact, I think, another problem. 

00:02:55
DIANE KJOS Oh goodness. 

00:02:55
DIANE KJOS As a profession, we've pretty much focused on methods of treatment. We have between 250 and 400 different models of psychotherapy, depending on how you count those particular approaches. I think adding another model of therapy is actually a bit of a mistake. Ah, I would say that what I try to do is Scott Miller, informed by clinical outcome research. 

00:03:15
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

00:03:15
JON CARLSON Hmm. So you don't have a name for this. So you're kind of like Prince, you've kind of taken the name away and it's just, has a . . . 

00:03:25
Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. 

00:03:25
1-2 

00:03:25
SCOTT MILLER I certainly that there are influences in my work as a result of my training and my therapy experiences. So there's some psychodynamic flavor, Rogerian flavor. There's certainly a Eriksonian piece and solution focused. 

00:03:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:03:35
SCOTT MILLER But what the client gets is Scott Miller. Ah, that's what they get for 50 minutes, ah, and my attempt to make sure that they find the process meaningful. 

00:03:45
JON CARLSON If you had to fumble with some kind of a name that best describes it, what would you call it? 

00:03:50
SCOTT MILLER I would say that, uhm, that I try to be client-directed as much as possible. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:03:55
1-3 

00:03:55
SCOTT MILLER They're the consumer of the service, what is it they're saying they would like me to do. What do they find meaningful and outcome informed. Has what I've done with them made a difference in their life. 

00:04:05
DIANE KJOS Wow. 

00:04:05
JON CARLSON Well, help us understand. What? 

00:04:10
DIANE KJOS Client sent--client. . . 

00:04:10
SCOTT MILLER Directed. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON . . . directed outcome informed. 

00:04:15
SCOTT MILLER Outcome informed. 

00:04:15
JON CARLSON Okay. Well, help us understand how this works. I mean, just, ah, how does brief therapy work for Scott Miller? 

00:04:20
SCOTT MILLER Well, that would be a question I would more ask the client. How did this or, in fact, did this particular thing work. I do think there are some common elements in all therapy, whether it comes out a brief therapy tradition of psychotherapy in general. I think that 40% of outcomes can be attributed to the client and what they bring to the therapy situation, their strengths, their resources, background, abilities, world view and culture, their language, their style. 

00:04:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:04:45
1-4 

00:04:45
SCOTT MILLER In combination with chance events. Ah, stuff that simply happens during the time we might be meeting with clients that has a favorable impact on outcome. The relationship factor is, I think, is probably the second most potent variable that accounts for change in psychotherapy. The client's participation in the process, our ability as therapists to form a relationship or alliance with them, built on a, ah, foundation of collaboration. Ah, there's also a placebo piece I think. Some hope and expectancy. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:05:15
SCOTT MILLER And then a very small amount of the variance seems to me to be attributable to the model or technique. 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:05:20
DIANE KJOS If we were to watch you, would we see sort of a series of strategies or behaviors that would be unique to Scott Miller or . . . 

00:05:30
1-5 

00:05:30
SCOTT MILLER Well, I, I think you're going to see me enact my way of doing what I believe are common core therapeutic processes. I think all models do these things. For example, uhm, I think all models encourage listening. Ah, which from our perspective is anything that the client feels like, ah, conveys that we're attending to them. The second piece is acknowledging. Somehow or other in the, in the context of the interaction, the client feels like I understand what it is that they are saying to me. The third common core process is validating. In other words, I selectively pay attention to some things in the interview and I selectively ignore other things in the interview. During that time--and by the way, all therapists have different ways of doing this. 

00:06:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:06:15
SCOTT MILLER All models have different styles. 

00:06:15
JON CARLSON How do, how do you decide what to attend to? 

00:06:20
SCOTT MILLER Again, I like to think that what I do is try to attend to the things that the research says work and really matter, not in terms of the process exactly what I did, but terms of the variables that research says matters. So client strengths, abilities, background, culture and world view. That's what I'm going to validate in the interview. That's what I'm going sort of try to sponge up . . . 

00:06:40
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:06:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . when I'm talking with the client. When I do that, very often there's kind of an inviting process that takes place. That's the fourth common core process. They start to interact with me more, start to deepen their participation with me. 

00:06:50
JON CARLSON So their resistance drops is what some people might say? 

00:06:55
1-6 

00:06:55
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, yeah, I, yeah. Well, I guess that's an interesting way to think about it. I would, ah, prefer to think about it in terms of more relationship-oriented terms. 

00:07:05
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:07:05
SCOTT MILLER That somehow or other our--we deepen in our commitment and in our relating to one another. If you talk about resistance, that's something that privileges the therapist's point of view. They are resisting me, I--they shouldn't do that. I must do things to overcome that. I, I don't buy it. Uhm, you can only think clients are resistant if you privilege your own position over theirs. Uhm, once we're inviting, then we typically move into what I call goaling or storying where we're creating something new, ah, a new vision, a new pur-, new story, new perspective. Again, all models do this. Ah, if you're a cognitive therapist, for example, you create a story with the client about thinking different thoughts. If you're dynamically oriented, you create a story about, different story about their childhood. They came in with one story about their childhood, the therapist works with them to create another one. Uhm, and then whenever the client mentions things that confirm that emerging story, the therapist pays attention to those. That's right, they say. That's basically what I think I do. But I do it . . . 

00:08:00
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:08:00
SCOTT MILLER . . . in Scott Miller style. 

00:08:00
1-7 

00:08:00
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:08:05
DIANE KJOS Help me a little bit. You used some language like privilege and so forth. 

00:08:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:08:05
DIANE KJOS What's the--where does that come from, and what are the roots of, of your perspective? What do you . . . 

00:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Well, I've, I've largely worked with, ah, marginalized populations. Ah, people who don't have access to mental healthcare. I work in a free clinic, for example. Don't charge my clients anything either. They're typically either the working class poor. There was a time when I worked primarily with homeless people. 

00:08:25
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

00:08:30
SCOTT MILLER And it seemed to me that most of the dominant treatment community used approaches that had been based, formulated and developed on a population that was very different from that. And so when I talk about privileging, I mean actually moving the center of the discourse away from the therapist experience of the process and more to the client's experience. What is it that they value. I think it comes from working people who are on the outskirts of, of society. 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:09:00
1-8 

00:09:00
DIANE KJOS What kind of background do you have in terms of training, you know, that type of thing. Where did you get your approach to therapy? 

00:09:10
SCOTT MILLER Well, I think there are kind of multiple influences that have happened in my life. Uhm, I went to graduate school and did a Ph.D. in psychology. There's certainly a lot of influence there. That's where more of the Rogerian background came from. Ah, at some point I became interested with Erikson's work, in particular his, his . . . 

00:09:30
JON CARLSON Milton Erikson? 

00:09:30
SCOTT MILLER Milton Erikson and his interest in following what the clients were saying and highlighting their abilities and strengths. I moved more to then solution-focused and since then have moved out of that and into this more outcome-based, ah, treatment. What is it that actually makes a difference in treatment. So all of those things have sort of combined together, plus, I mean, how can you not say that my background and upbringing and all that stuff certainly influences, ah, what I do. 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON And your family of origin and that family and trans-generational. It sounds like this is the evolution of this process and that's the way it should be. 

00:10:00
1-9 

00:10:00
JON CARLSON Right. And that's actually why, it's actually why I would say that, uhm, the client gets what the therapist has to offer. 

00:10:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:10:10
SCOTT MILLER And most of the variance in the treatment is due to the therapist. Only 15% of the outcome, only 15% of the variance associated with the outcome can be attributed to the model a therapist uses. 

00:10:20
Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D., ABPP 

00:10:20
SCOTT MILLER Thirty percent attributable to the relationship factors. So I think our profession has literally been one in which the tail has wagged the dog. We've got models galore. Ah, but we've got tons of effective therapists. Those are the people we should be looking at. 

00:10:35
JON CARLSON It's a lot easier to look at the models though than at ourselves, you know. 

00:10:40
SCOTT MILLER Perhaps so. And it makes certainly licensuring and credentialing much easier and less painful. If they can have a certain knowledge base and say this is what makes people effective. 

00:10:45
DIANE KJOS Yes. 

00:10:45
SCOTT MILLER I'm, I'm suspicious of that. Uhm, and most people know this intuitively. Ah, my clients seem to care less about which model I practice and that's mor-, if a get a phone call from a therapist, they want to know that. Uhm, but the clients want to know were they effective and they usually find that out by talking to their . . . 

00:11:05
DIANE KJOS Other clients. 

00:11:05
1-10 

00:11:05
SCOTT MILLER Right, right. 

00:11:05
JON CARLSON Going back to that piece you were talking about storying or . . . 

00:11:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:11:10
JON CARLSON . . . or goaling. 

00:11:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:11:10
JON CARLSON Is that how change takes place then? Is that you really, ah, it's this constructivist, ah, ah model that you're really having people write a new story for their life? 

00:11:25
SCOTT MILLER I don't if that's how . . . 

00:11:25
JON CARLSON Create a new story in their reality? 

00:11:25
SCOTT MILLER I don't know if I can even answer how change takes place. For me, it's more of a description of what I see when I watch therapists working. Therapists--our field has been bound up with this notion that our models are true. Ah, that what we're doing is fixing real problems. I'm not so sure of that. What I see therapists do is create different stories depending on their background,0 experience and training. So if, if that--is that where change takes place? I don't know. When I look at it and try to describe what they do, they seem to be creating stories. 

00:12:00
JON CARLSON So the outcome that you look for . . . 

00:12:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:12:00
JON CARLSON . . . is a new story. 

00:12:00
SCOTT MILLER Well, actually the outcome I look for is the client saying that this particular story construction helped me. 

00:12:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:05
1-11 

00:12:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, and in that regard, ah, it seems pretty hard to determine a priori which story's going to work with which client. We've got 400 different models of therapy or more. 

00:12:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:12:15
SCOTT MILLER They all achieve roughly equivalent outcomes. Well, that tells me we can't privilege one model over the other. Ah, we have to find a story that the client experiences as meaningful. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Okay, so, but that's, that's how the change is actually taking place though, is that they're working very hard at developing a meaningful story for their life? Is this kind of a cognitive approach you'd say? 

00:12:45
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, again, I'm not sure if that's how change takes place. 

00:12:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:12:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, that to me reflects a structural assumption that there is such a thing as change. 

00:12:50
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:12:50
1-12 

00:12:50
SCOTT MILLER I think I can measure prior to therapy and the end of therapy and see if change did take place, but I don't have a theory about how happens. I'm just describing what I see when I watch videotapes of therapists from different models working. They seem to be creating stories. That seems to be what we do. Is that, is that related to change? I'm not, I'm not so sure. 

00:13:10
DIANE KJOS Or does the change make a new story? 

00:13:15
SCOTT MILLER I think, I think both. Yeah. 

00:13:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Well, is there any research that supports, ah, this approach to, to help you? 

00:13:20
SCOTT MILLER I think that's really, an, ah, a very important question and something that we haven't paid enough attention to. For most of our history, therapists have paid attention to and training has been oriented towards process. And we looked, as your last question reflected, at how eloquent the process was. Did it make sense to us. And when it seems to go according to the rules, we say that's beautiful clinical work. But when I look at the data, I don't see a whole lot of correlation between most therapeutic process and outcome, hence all models end up being equal. So I think there are two important things. We do know that therapy works. The average treated client is better off than 80% of those in the untreated sampling in most studies. That's really, that's really particularly good news. So we know that therapy works. 

00:14:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:14:05
1-13 

00:14:05
SCOTT MILLER These four basic factors I, I mentioned, extra therapeutic, the client's strengths and sources, relationship factors, hope and expectancy and model and technique seem to be common across the approaches. That's one part of it. I also think, however, that since model and technique only account for about 15%, ah, that we need to do research on whether or not you as a therapist are effective. 

00:14:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:14:30
SCOTT MILLER I'm not impressed by therapists who can do really eloquent clinical work. I want to know did their clients find it meaningful. 

00:14:35
DIANE KJOS Big difference. 

00:14:35
SCOTT MILLER And each, each therapist, I think, probably has a different level of effectiveness. We haven't looked at that. At our particular clinic, what we've been doing is measuring individual therapist's effectiveness with a broad range of clients. We've found that some therapists can do it. Other thera-, other therapists can't. Uh, regardless of their training and experience. 

00:14:55
JON CARLSON But some therapists can work with certain clients and not others? 

00:15:00
1-14 

00:15:00
SCOTT MILLER That's also happening. Ah, and that's beginning to emerge for us now, that some therapists seem more effective with certain kinds of client groups, ah, other therapists seem to be less effective. So maybe we can fit those two things together. 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON Do some matching? 

00:15:15
SCOTT MILLER Perhaps. 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:15:15
DIANE KJOS Are there client groups that, or, or, specific types of individuals who might present for therapy that nothing works with? Are there . . . 

00:15:25
JON CARLSON As untreatable, hopeless. 

00:15:25
DIANE KJOS Are there un-hopeless ones? 

00:15:30
JON CARLSON I think you wrote a book about that, didn't you? 

00:15:30
SCOTT MILLER About impossible cases. 

00:15:30
DIANE KJOS Impossible cases. 

00:15:30
SCOTT MILLER Right, right. Uhm, I don't know that there's anything, ah, in general that I can say about clients as a group. Again, that's sort of sets the locus of the conversation, the locus of . . . 

00:15:40
DIANE KJOS It's their fault. 

00:15:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . responsibility for the failure on them. I can say that it's very clear that there are therapies that go nowhere. What would be important is to know that early in the treatment process because we know from the research literature that the majority of clients should be on the way within seven to ten sessions. We know that. 

00:16:00
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:16:00
1-15 

00:16:00
SCOTT MILLER If they're not on the way within seven to ten sessions, the chances of them making changes with this therapist, at this time, using this method are very slim. So I would say what's important to do is know is this therapy working at this moment in time. If it's not after seven or eight visits, we need to end those cases. I think that is our ethical obligation. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:16:20
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

00:16:25
JON CARLSON Well, are the people though, groups, that this approach just wouldn't work for, like non-verbal people or people who are, ah, has extreme pathology? 

00:16:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, again, I think that most of that sets the responsibility on them. I would--my preference would be to work and then measure, work, measure and see if, in fact, we're making a difference. 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON So it's likely that your approach doesn't work for quite, quite a few people but you won't know that until you try? 

00:16:55
SCOTT MILLER My sense is that our particular way my, my Scott Miller therapy is, ah, no more effective than anybody else's particular approach. I'm success with about, ah, really, really successful with about five out of ten cases. 

00:17:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:17:10
1-16 

00:17:10
SCOTT MILLER So the two out of, two out of the ten, I'm moderately successful with and between two and three out of ten, we don't seem to make progress. The difference is, I know that but the fourth or fifth visit and I can say to the client . . . 

00:17:25
JON CARLSON This isn't going anywhere. 

00:17:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . this isn't going anywhere. Can we talk about this. Let's get you to somebody else. There's lot of people out there that may be able to offer you something I haven't been able to offer. 

00:17:35
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

00:17:35
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:17:35
SCOTT MILLER What we've done, by the way, is instead whenever we, whenever, whenever we meet one of these clients, we've number one pathologized the client, here's why it doesn't work. Ah, it's because of them. 

00:17:50
JON CARLSON It's your fault. 

00:17:50
DIANE KJOS It's your fault. 

00:17:50
SCOTT MILLER It's your fault or we've invented a new method of therapy. Ah, it didn't work because this client needs this particular kind of therapy. 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON Sure. Yeah. 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON Okay. Okay. But, but you're saying that it, it ma-, it may be that it's the relationship or it's the interaction between the two of you? 

00:18:05
SCOTT MILLER I'm saying it--the com--the number of factors responsible for it defy . . . 

00:18:10
DIANE KJOS Ah. 

00:18:10
1-17 

00:18:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . our ability to know what they are. It seems more sensible to say since clients who aren't changing by the seventh visit, eighth visit have very little chance of changing maybe they need to see somebody else. That would at least increase the odds of that. Continuing to see them over time, I think, digs our--digs us into a deeper hole. 

00:18:30
DIANE KJOS Okay. In a moment, we're going to watch you work with a man . . . 

00:18:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:18:35
DIANE KJOS . . . who says that others, others tell him he's indecisive and that he has problems with commitment. Ah . . . 

00:18:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:18:40
JON CARLSON Can you tell me a little bit about what you think about prior to the interview with a client and, ah, what you were thinking about as you went into, ah, work with him? 

00:18:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, what am I going to have for dinner tonight. 

00:18:55
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:18:55
1-18 

00:18:55
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, did I, did I lock my car, ah, when I came into the clinic is typically what I think about. I don't read paperwork that's, that's either gathered by an intake officer. Uhm, I, I like things to be, uhm, an empty canvas so that . . . 

00:19:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:19:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . so that we can create something together that's liked and experienced as meaningful by the client. 

00:19:25
DIANE KJOS One of the things that, uhm, uhm, that, that we saw, uhm, because this was, the, the, this, ah, session was videotaped earlier, was that you spent quite a bit of time before we were ready to start running the videotapes . . . 

00:19:35
SCOTT MILLER Yes, yes. 

00:19:35
DIANE KJOS . . . talking with him. 

00:19:40
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:19:40
DIANE KJOS Do you want to talk a little bit about that? 

00:19:40
Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. 

00:19:40
SCOTT MILLER Well, in fact, my sense is that, uhm, that was probably the most useful part of the therapy, ah, if we can call it that. Uhm, we talked about fishing. Uhm, we talked about where he lives and what he did for a living. Uhm, we chit-chatted. And as a result, I think that the interview was very comfortable for, for both of us. 

00:20:05
1-19 

00:20:05
JON CARLSON Well, some people might think that approaching therapy that way is irresponsible, that you really haven't done the proper, ah, pre-assessment. Ah, you haven't, ah, found out why the person is there, what it is that they're, they're coming for, to decide whether or not . . . 

00:20:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:20:15
JON CARLSON . . . this is within your, ah, training, realm of, ah, expertise. 

00:20:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. Well, I, I'm, I'm actually at the present point fairly discourage about our ability to predict a priori whether we're going to be successful with a given client. 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:20:35
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, plus, I think there's an economic issue here. Ah, the cost of evaluating the client prior to therapy starting ranges anywhere from $150 to $700, depending on how elaborate the process is. Most of my clients are finished with that amount of money. I can see them for that amount of money . . . 

00:20:50
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:20:50
1-20 

00:20:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . ah, with, and, and, and we, and we can done. So since those a priori measures or a priori assessments aren't very hopeful in terms of predicting outcome or matching therapists at the present point--that may change in the future, I don't know why we spend a lot of time doing them. What is highly predictive of change in therapy are the client's response to the therapist in the first handful of visits. We haven't spent any more money. 

00:21:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:21:20
SCOTT MILLER Or time really. So I, I think that in most cases, we should start and see what happens. 

00:21:25
DIANE KJOS And so maybe that time you spent talking about fishing is the, is--resulted in him saying, I want to see you again? 

00:21:35
SCOTT MILLER In fact, I, I think probably so. Uhm, and again, I, I, I consider that, uhm, I'm fairly honored by that. Ah, his circle of friends is, ah, ah, he holds them very tightly and, and near to him. There are three or four people he speaks with. And, as you know, he took quite a while, as you'll see, he took quite a while to open up to people in his personal life. He did that in the course of an hour here. 

00:22:00
JON CARLSON Well, can you set this up for the viewers? I mean, you're really saying that you walk into this as a blank slate. What are the . . . 

00:22:05
SCOTT MILLER No, I didn't say that. 

00:22:05
JON CARLSON Okay, an empty canvas. 

00:22:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. I want to--I'm going to paint a canvas so it . . . 

00:22:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:22:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . wi-, with him. Uhm, so I . . . 

00:22:10
DIANE KJOS Together. 

00:22:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:22:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:22:15
1-21 

00:22:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. I don't, I don't, I certainly have stuff that I bring to the session. I don't think it's the typical stuff about what is the problem, uhm, what particular diagnosis does he have. 

00:22:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
SCOTT MILLER Ah, thinking that I can predict beforehand what whether or not I'm going to be successful. 

00:22:30
JON CARLSON So what should our viewers look for when they're watching this video and watching Scott Miller therapy? 

00:22:35
SCOTT MILLER Not at me, not at me. I would look at the client and ask what kinds of things did he respond to and how do we know that. Uhm, and pay attention to that. Did the client experience this as meaningful? Did it deepen the participation, ah, that we had? Did the client feel understood? Did the client feel like I was attending to them? Did the, did the client buy the story that was being created? Uhm, that's what I would look for. I would watch the client. He is wonderful to watch. 

00:23:05
JON CARLSON How about if they were to watch you too. What would they be looking for? I mean, the, the, the notion of the way that you selectively attend to some things . . . 

00:23:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:23:10
JON CARLSON . . . and let other things just pass by. 

00:23:15
1-22 

00:23:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay, fair, fair question. You could watch what I did attend to and then ask yourself, what would I have attended to and why, why the difference and what possibilities, ah, did we encounter or not encounter as, as a result. 

00:23:30
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
JON CARLSON We'll have to watch this at least a couple of times to, to try on these different roles . . . 

00:23:35
DIANE KJOS Different roles. 

00:23:35
JON CARLSON . . . of watching the therapist and watching the client. Let's look. 

00:23:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Hi. 

00:23:45
PATIENT SCOTT Hello. 

00:23:45
2-1 

00:23:45
SCOTT MILLER My name is Scott. 

00:23:50
PATIENT SCOTT I'm Scott. 

00:23:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Is it okay if I call you Scott? 

00:23:50
PATIENT SCOTT It's fine. 

00:23:50
SCOTT MILLER Good enough. Uhm, let me tell you just a little bit about how I work and then, uhm, if you have any question or anything, let me know. 

00:24:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, usually when I meet somebody I'll spend about 30 to 35 minutes chatting with them, getting to know them a bit. 

00:24:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:24:10
SCOTT MILLER Find out, uhm, what they're hoping for from the visit. 

00:24:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
SCOTT MILLER And, uhm, then I'll take a break and just take some time to myself to kind of think what, what they've said . . . 

00:24:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:24:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . and pull together some thoughts. At that time, you can also think if, ah, you have some reflections about what we've talked about, anything that seemed helpful. You know . . . 

00:24:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:24:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . let me know when I come back and I'll share my thoughts with you. 

00:24:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:24:35
SCOTT MILLER So . . . 

00:24:35
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds good. 

00:24:35
2-2 

00:24:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay, good enough. Uhm, hmm, tells me just a little bit about, ah, yourself and what you're hoping for from tonight. Ah, any thoughts you'd had about that. 

00:24:45
PATIENT SCOTT Well, everybody always tell me, I'm a little bit, ah, scared to make commitments. 

00:24:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:24:50
PATIENT SCOTT And they always said that I would just say, I don't always want to make a decision right away. 

00:25:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:25:00
PATIENT SCOTT Always kind of hem-haw around about it. 

00:25:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:25:05
PATIENT SCOTT And that, I don't know, that's probably true. 

00:25:05
SCOTT MILLER It is? 

00:25:05
PATIENT SCOTT But I don't know if it's just me or if it's just I'm a big chicken to do it. 

00:25:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So it, you, you would say that the, these people who make these . . . 

00:25:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:25:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . comments, that their view may be accurate? 

00:25:20
PATIENT SCOTT Could be, yeah. 

00:25:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay, could be. 

00:25:20
PATIENT SCOTT And it, yeah, cuz it, it ain't just one person telling me . . . 

00:25:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:25:20
PATIENT SCOTT . . . it's, you know, there have been several people tell me. So I kind of said, well, you know, if one person said well, you know, I'd think about it. But when more than that, you know, something is gotta be going on. 

00:25:30
SCOTT MILLER All right. So you've heard this stuff . . . 

00:25:35
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:25:35
SCOTT MILLER . . . before. 

00:25:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:25:35
SCOTT MILLER And you start thinking, well, you know . . . 

00:25:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:25:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:35
PATIENT SCOTT And they go, just make up your mind and do it, you know. 

00:25:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:40
PATIENT SCOTT Either you're not or you are, one of the two. 

00:25:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:40
PATIENT SCOTT And I hear that at work too once and a while. 

00:25:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:45
PATIENT SCOTT And it, it's, it's very true. 

00:25:45
2-3 

00:25:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so it takes you some time to make a decision. 

00:25:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:25:50
SCOTT MILLER Do you eventually make the decision? 

00:25:50
PATIENT SCOTT Usually, yeah. 

00:25:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:50
PATIENT SCOTT I did--I try to weigh out the situation, which is the best way. 

00:25:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:25:55
PATIENT SCOTT It may not always be right but . . . 

00:25:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:26:00
PATIENT SCOTT It, it makes it tough sometimes. 

00:26:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so you're the kind of guy who carefully weighs a decision, considers the options . . . 

00:26:05
PATIENT SCOTT Tries to anyhow. Uh-huh. 

00:26:10
SCOTT MILLER Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't . . . 

00:26:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:26:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . of course. 

00:26:10
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Sometimes I wonder if you're better off just to go to with your gut feeling and go for it. 

00:26:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Do you do that sometimes? 

00:26:15
PATIENT SCOTT Once in a while. 

00:26:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:26:15
PATIENT SCOTT But it never fails, something's always screwed up. 

00:26:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So that's less somehow . . . 

00:26:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Right. 

00:26:20
SCOTT MILLER When you've done that, the results aren't as . . . 

00:26:25
PATIENT SCOTT They're not as good. 

00:26:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:26:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, it, I don't know, lot of times, it--plans get changed. Dadgummit, here we had this all planned out to go and it don't go. 

00:26:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:26:35
PATIENT SCOTT Somebody throwed a wrench in the pile and there--now we're sitting. 

00:26:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, you didn't plan careful enough that time. 

00:26:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:26:40
SCOTT MILLER That's the sort of thought that comes back to you? 

00:26:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:26:40
SCOTT MILLER And maybe you then, you think I should plan more carefully . . . 

00:26:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:26:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . in the future. 

00:26:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:26:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:26:45
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm always trying to look out for everybody else instead of myself. 

00:26:45
2-4 

00:26:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:26:45
PATIENT SCOTT I don't, I don't know why but, I, I'll ask Nancy, well, what'd you want to do. I said, it don't make me no difference either way. 

00:26:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:26:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I get--well, she tells me to make the decision. 

00:27:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:27:00
PATIENT SCOTT I'll make it and dadgummit, that ain't where I wanted to go. 

00:27:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. So Nancy, who's Nancy? 

00:27:05
PATIENT SCOTT Oh, that's my girlfriend. 

00:27:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And is she one of these, uhm, voices . . . 

00:27:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:27:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . that say, you know . . . 

00:27:10
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:27:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . come on, Scott . . . 

00:27:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:27:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:27:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. And what, I've knowed her for five, five and half years, something like that. 

00:27:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:27:20
PATIENT SCOTT So it's . . . 

00:27:20
SCOTT MILLER Have you been kind of boyfriend girlfriend. 

00:27:20
PATIENT SCOTT Darn near the whole time. 

00:27:25
SCOTT MILLER Oh wow. 

00:27:25
PATIENT SCOTT She moved in next door to where I lived and that's how I met her. 

00:27:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:27:25
PATIENT SCOTT And then, just ever since then, we've been going out or we lived together for four years so . . . 

00:27:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So you're together living in the same house now for . . . 

00:27:35
PATIENT SCOTT Not right now, we're not. 

00:27:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay. 

00:27:35
PATIENT SCOTT But we're working on it so . . . 

00:27:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

00:27:40
PATIENT SCOTT But things are going real good so far. 

00:27:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so things are actually going well with, with Nancy? 

00:27:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:27:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Tell me more about that. 

00:27:45
PATIENT SCOTT Well, like I said, we started going out five . . . 

00:27:45
2-5 

00:27:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
PATIENT SCOTT . . . at least five years ago. 

00:27:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
PATIENT SCOTT And she had problems with her girl-, with her girlfriend where she lived. 

00:27:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
PATIENT SCOTT And they got in a fight one night and moved her out in about two hours. 

00:27:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I pulled all the strings. I had her furniture at my grandmother's, at my house and my father's house. 

00:28:00
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:28:00
PATIENT SCOTT And I moved her at my father's house so . . . 

00:28:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:28:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and it just kind of progressed from there. And we got a place together. We lived together for quite a while. 

00:28:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
PATIENT SCOTT And last summer, we had some problems . . . 

00:28:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:28:15
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and she decided she was going to move out. 

00:28:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:28:15
PATIENT SCOTT Which . . . 

00:28:20
SCOTT MILLER Now is that the summer before this current summer? 

00:28:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, last fall. 

00:28:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:28:20
PATIENT SCOTT About a year ago. 

00:28:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay, okay. 

00:28:20
PATIENT SCOTT And, you know, we had some problems that we've worked on it a bunch. Cuz I had, like I say, I've had problems with my temper. 

00:28:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:28:25
PATIENT SCOTT And I've worked on it. And it, it's had its good and bad. 

00:28:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:28:35
PATIENT SCOTT And right now, things are a whole lot better than what they were a year ago. 

00:28:40
SCOTT MILLER With Nancy and with your temper? 

00:28:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:28:40
SCOTT MILLER How has that happened? 

00:28:40
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I'd had a little bit of counseling that I received here at the college. 

00:28:45
SCOTT MILLER You did? 

00:28:45
2-6 

00:28:45
PATIENT SCOTT And that's helped a bunch. I mean, it hadn't, you know, I just can't do the things I was doing and listening to my mother. Hey, you can't do the things you've doing. And getting a little older it's finally starting to sink, sink in. 

00:29:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So with age comes some maturity . . . 

00:29:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:29:05
SCOTT MILLER . . . I guess. We can all hope. 

00:29:05
PATIENT SCOTT All right. Because I turned 30 last fall, so it was a . . . 

00:29:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:29:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . little bit different. 

00:29:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:29:10
PATIENT SCOTT So it . . . 

00:29:10
SCOTT MILLER So the age in combination with the counseling . . . 

00:29:15
PATIENT SCOTT It's all . . . 

00:29:15
SCOTT MILLER And did you also say something about your mom or . . . 

00:29:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:29:15
SCOTT MILLER That she'd been helpful too? 

00:29:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, she helps me a little bit. 

00:29:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:29:20
PATIENT SCOTT And my one uncle. I, if I ever got problems or whatever, I call him on the phone and I go from there. 

00:29:25
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Cuz that, like I say, sometimes you just need somebody to talk to. Not necessarily like to call up Nancy and talk to her but just, you know, yeah. Guy-to-guy talk, you know. 

00:29:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. 

00:29:35
PATIENT SCOTT It's--I don't know, sometimes it's a little easier to say what you're going to say . . . 

00:29:40
SCOTT MILLER Sure. 

00:29:40
PATIENT SCOTT . . . than--cuz I'm-- if I tell Nancy, I'm afraid I'm going to say something . . . 

00:29:45
SCOTT MILLER Might mess things up. 

00:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:29:50
SCOTT MILLER Make it worse. 

00:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:29:50
2-7 

00:29:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. And you don't want that . . . 

00:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:29:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . of course. 

00:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT No. 

00:29:50
SCOTT MILLER It's not planned that way. 

00:29:55
PATIENT SCOTT Exactly. 

00:29:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. So you sort of--again, this seems to me to be this part of you that this more careful planner. 

00:30:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:30:00
SCOTT MILLER You talk to this other person first and try to . . . 

00:30:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Am I going about this the right way? 

00:30:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:30:05
PATIENT SCOTT And most of the time, he's a great help to me. 

00:30:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:30:10
PATIENT SCOTT And my mother helps me a little bit but Uncle Jerry, he's the one that, that helps. 

00:30:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay, and it's more of this kind of man to man . . . 

00:30:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:30:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . conversation that he helps. 

00:30:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:30:20
SCOTT MILLER That you can talk it out. 

00:30:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:30:20
SCOTT MILLER Is there some way in particular, the way you guys do it that, that you find really, you know, helpful? 

00:30:25
PATIENT SCOTT We just sit out there in the garage and we're working on a car or . . . 

00:30:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:30:25
PATIENT SCOTT . . . you know, just something like that. 

00:30:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:30:30
PATIENT SCOTT Nobody else around and that, that's a great help to me. 

00:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:30:35
PATIENT SCOTT That's the way I used to do to Grandpa until he passed away and then after that, I had to really find somebody. It took a long time to . . . 

00:30:40
SCOTT MILLER How'd you eventually find Jerry? 

00:30:45
PATIENT SCOTT Well, just, I don't know, when Grandpa . . . 

00:30:45
SCOTT MILLER I mean, how'd you eventually find out that he was the kind of a guy that you could have sort of the same conversations like you had with your grandfather? 

00:30:50
2-8 

00:30:50
PATIENT SCOTT I don't know. I, a lot of it was probably because he was a lot like Grandpa. 

00:30:55
SCOTT MILLER Oh, okay. Now he's your grandfather's . . . 

00:30:55
PATIENT SCOTT Son. 

00:30:55
SCOTT MILLER Son. 

00:30:55
PATIENT SCOTT Right. On my mother's side. Uh-huh. And it just, I started going over there at different times. 

00:31:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:31:05
PATIENT SCOTT We'd just, like I said, we'd sit out there in the garage and just shoot the bologna. 

00:31:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:31:10
PATIENT SCOTT Absolutely nothing. 

00:31:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:31:10
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:31:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . it feels real good just to take the pressure off. 

00:31:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. This wasn't an instant kind of thing? 

00:31:15
PATIENT SCOTT No. 

00:31:15
SCOTT MILLER You kind of also with him, you felt it out . . . 

00:31:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:31:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . you shot the bologna, you talked for a while and then . . . 

00:31:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:31:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . this relationship deepened. 

00:31:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Yeah. 

00:31:25
SCOTT MILLER Am I getting this right? 

00:31:25
PATIENT SCOTT You--exactly right. 

00:31:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:31:25
PATIENT SCOTT My Uncle Jerry's more of a father to me than my father probably ever will be. 

00:31:30
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:31:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it, Dad and me, you know, we're probably about this far apart and Jerry and me are like this. 

00:31:35
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:31:35
PATIENT SCOTT If I need something in the middle of the night, all I got to do is call him and he'll be there. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:31:40
PATIENT SCOTT And is that--that's nice. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER It's incredible to have that kind of relationship . . . 

00:31:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:31:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . in your life. 

00:31:45
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:31:45
SCOTT MILLER It is. 

00:31:45
PATIENT SCOTT You know, that's the way he tells me too, if I need something in the middle of the night, all I know, all I got to do is call you and you'll be there. 

00:31:50
SCOTT MILLER And you trust him. 

00:31:50
2-9 

00:31:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Uh-huh. It's nice to have somebody like that around. 

00:31:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:31:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:31:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:31:55
PATIENT SCOTT It's got me over a, some, some bad times. 

00:32:00
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Like what? 

00:32:00
PATIENT SCOTT Well, like when Nancy and me were having problems. 

00:32:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:32:00
PATIENT SCOTT Stuff like that. 

00:32:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:32:05
PATIENT SCOTT And that, that helped. And when my Grandpa passed away and then I lost my sister. It was like five deaths in the family within a year. 

00:32:10
SCOTT MILLER Wow. And just how long--I'm sorry. 

00:32:10
PATIENT SCOTT It was about five years ago now. 

00:32:15
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:32:15
PATIENT SCOTT It was just before I met Nancy. 

00:32:15
 Wow. 

00:32:15
PATIENT SCOTT And man, it was darn tough. 

00:32:15
SCOTT MILLER It sounds like it. 

00:32:20
PATIENT SCOTT And it was, you know, and then I started talking with him. 

00:32:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:32:20
PATIENT SCOTT And that, that helped. 

00:32:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:32:25
PATIENT SCOTT It kept me going. 

00:32:25
SCOTT MILLER It kept you going. 

00:32:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:32:25
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. So it sounds like too that you're a people person. 

00:32:30
PATIENT SCOTT Oh yeah. 

00:32:30
PATIENT SCOTT You're not somebody that, I mean, you know, obviously you're outgoing but it takes you, you like to build relationships slowly. 

00:32:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:32:35
SCOTT MILLER And over time. Am I getting this? 

00:32:35
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Yeah. 

00:32:35
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

00:32:35
PATIENT SCOTT It takes me a while to get to where I trust somebody enough to . . . 

00:32:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:32:40
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to let them, you know, go. 

00:32:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:32:45
PATIENT SCOTT And like in my business too, I got to trust the guy that's watching the banks for me. If I don't trust him, you know, I'm only as, as alive if he is watching. 

00:32:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:32:50
PATIENT SCOTT If he don't watch me, I could be dead tomorrow. 

00:32:50
2-10 

00:32:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:32:55
PATIENT SCOTT And, you know, that happens. 

00:32:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. How do, I mean, do you trust the bank person now? 

00:33:00
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, yeah. I watch, you know, I watch a little bit and then I've got a couple of other people that help me watch. 

00:33:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:33:05
PATIENT SCOTT So, cuz I don't ever want to get covered up again. 

00:33:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:33:05
PATIENT SCOTT Once was enough. 

00:33:05
SCOTT MILLER Oh, you've already had this happen to you? 

00:33:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, I've had it happen once, and I don't ever want it to happen again. 

00:33:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. So it's both. It's both that, and I imagine maybe the same with Jerry, that, that, uhm, you, you take a while to build this relationship. 

00:33:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:33:20
SCOTT MILLER But then there's also a part of you that sort of keeps an eye on yourself as well. 

00:33:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Yeah. 

00:33:25
SCOTT MILLER Making sure that things are okay and that you're still safe and that . . . 

00:33:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:33:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:33:30
PATIENT SCOTT Like a sixth sense almost. 

00:33:30
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:33:30
PATIENT SCOTT You got, you can feel that something ain't quite right. 

00:33:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:33:30
PATIENT SCOTT Like when I'm in the hole, most of the time, I can feel the ground move before you can see it move. 

00:33:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:33:35
PATIENT SCOTT Just som-, you can feel it. How, I don't know. 

00:33:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:33:40
PATIENT SCOTT But you feel it. 

00:33:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:33:40
PATIENT SCOTT It's just something you look at-- you feel. 

00:33:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. I was just struck by all these things that, I mean, you've had going on. You had the, the, uhm, the difficulties with Nancy . . . 

00:33:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:33:50
2-11 

00:33:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . that you guys went through. You had, ah, the deaths . . . 

00:33:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:33:55
SCOTT MILLER . . . of these close family members. Uhm, you had this anger that you were sort of working on and struggling with. 

00:34:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:34:00
SCOTT MILLER You're saying that those things are kind of on the roll. 

00:34:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. And I'm not a go-, a person most of the time to go out and just go start talking and I hold a lot of it inside and I just keep burning and burning in there. 

00:34:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:34:15
PATIENT SCOTT And it comes to a head sometimes. 

00:34:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:34:15
PATIENT SCOTT But it, you know, I learned it helps and I, lot of times I just go out to the shop and I'll work on a car or whatever just to get away from everybody for an hour or two. 

00:34:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So when you have that feeling of things kind of burning inside . . . 

00:34:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:34:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . one way you take care of it is by . . . 

00:34:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:34:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . getting off to yourself. That helps you I guess to keep from what? 

00:34:35
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. It keeps my temper under control. 

00:34:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:34:35
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:34:40
SCOTT MILLER Where'd you learn this? 

00:34:40
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't know. It was something that Nancy or somebody was telling me. She always told--one or her girlfriends read it in a book, you should--one of them should always walk away. 

00:34:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:34:50
2-12 

00:34:50
PATIENT SCOTT Well, that didn't always work because, I'd day well, I walked away the last three times we've had a discussion. Well, it's your turn to walk away. 

00:34:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:34:55
PATIENT SCOTT Or she'd follow me right out to the garage. 

00:35:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:35:00
PATIENT SCOTT You know. But I, I'd do it at work if, you know, if things were going bad or whatever, I'd just go to the water cooler and get a drink. 

00:35:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:35:05
PATIENT SCOTT And just stay away from everybody for a couple of minutes, come back and we'll hit her hard again. 

00:35:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:35:10
PATIENT SCOTT Boss and me will discuss what, you know, we need to do . . . 

00:35:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:35:15
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and we'll go from there. That way nobody gets hurt and it's the safest way to do it. 

00:35:20
SCOTT MILLER So there's a combination of things that I'm catching here . . . 

00:35:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . that, that you, you not only sometimes take a break and say I got to get away. 

00:35:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:35:25
SCOTT MILLER But there's always times where you discuss it? 

00:35:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Uh-huh. Well . . . 

00:35:30
SCOTT MILLER How, how do make the decision between the two? I mean, I'm sort of struck by that. 

00:35:35
PATIENT SCOTT Well, just kind of feeling out the situation . . . 

00:35:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:35:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . between how the boss is reacting, how I feel about it. 

00:35:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:35:40
PATIENT SCOTT How things are going all-, in general. 

00:35:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:35:40
PATIENT SCOTT You know, if it's been one them kind of days where everything is just went wrong . . . 

00:35:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:35:45
PATIENT SCOTT . . . I just walk away. 

00:35:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:35:45
PATIENT SCOTT And I go to the truck. 

00:35:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:35:50
PATIENT SCOTT But, you know, if things have been going good and all of a sudden, we've got a problem. All right, well, what is the problem here? 

00:35:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:35:55
2-13 

00:35:55
PATIENT SCOTT Let's find out why and we'll go from there. 

00:36:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:36:00
PATIENT SCOTT If it was something I did or just the way things happened, you know, it-- let's put it behind us. Let's go. 

00:36:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:36:05
PATIENT SCOTT We've got, you know, neither one of us . . . 

00:36:05
SCOTT MILLER Say, say this last part again. 

00:36:05
PATIENT SCOTT You know, we'll just put everything behind us, you know. Sure I screwed up or he did . . . 

00:36:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:36:10
PATIENT SCOTT Hey, you know, we don't intend to screw up but if we're working, it happens. 

00:36:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So there's a big forgiveness part in this too? 

00:36:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:36:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay, and I'm not going to make a mountain out . . . 

00:36:20
PATIENT SCOTT Try too. 

00:36:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . every mole hill that--he tried. 

00:36:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:36:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:36:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:36:20
SCOTT MILLER You discuss it, sometimes you figure out why, you move on. 

00:36:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:36:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:36:25
PATIENT SCOTT And that's what Nancy and me have been trying to do. And, you know, that--instead of get--have--getting mad at each other, let's find out why. And sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. 

00:36:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:36:35
PATIENT SCOTT But it's gotten a lot, like I say, a lot better. 

00:36:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And, and that's--I'm really curious about that because you, you not only do this in your personal life . . . 

00:36:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:36:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . and your work life but you also do it in your intimate life with, with Nancy. So you've been trying to do that. 

00:36:50
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:36:50
2-14 

00:36:50
SCOTT MILLER So sometimes if things have, things are just starting to get a little sort of on the edge . . . 

00:36:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:37:00
SCOTT MILLER . . . I'm guessing then that's when you sort of approach Nancy . . . 

00:37:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:37:00
SCOTT MILLER . . . or she approaches you or how does that happen? 

00:37:00
PATIENT SCOTT Ah, sometimes it's kind of a mutual thing. 

00:37:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:37:05
PATIENT SCOTT And, and you, you kind of feel it between, you know, well this, it ain't going good here. 

00:37:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:37:10
PATIENT SCOTT Why ain't it? 

00:37:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:37:10
PATIENT SCOTT You know, and we'll talk about it. Well, most of the time, it's just a lack of communication. 

00:37:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:37:15
PATIENT SCOTT Or it, somebody throwed a clinker in there and set her back a half hour or I didn't get there on time. And it's just something--you know, we both had a plan to be here at 6:30. 

00:37:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:37:30
PATIENT SCOTT Well, she had to work late or whatever. 

00:37:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:37:30
PATIENT SCOTT And we're both tired. Well . . . 

00:37:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:37:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . you know, we know what the problem is. We're both just exhausted. 

00:37:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:37:35
PATIENT SCOTT And that, you know, like--then we go from there. 

00:37:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Once you're able to get to sort of the thing . . . 

00:37:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:37:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . and then mutual understanding . . . 

00:37:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:37:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . break that communication, I don't know, stoppage or backup . . . 

00:37:50
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:37:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . uhm, then, then it moves on. 

00:37:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:37:50
SCOTT MILLER And things are cool? 

00:37:55
PATIENT SCOTT Right. It usually works out real good. 

00:37:55
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:37:55
2-15 

00:37:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. You know, like last weekend, we had a little problem cuz we was at--when, ah, when we got up, we were supposed to go out fishing that morning . . . 

00:38:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:38:00
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and it was raining. 

00:38:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:38:05
PATIENT SCOTT And so they didn't want to go fishing. 

00:38:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:38:05
PATIENT SCOTT But my mother was planning on going fishing . . . 

00:38:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:38:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and she wanted--Nancy wanted to go shopping. I said well, I tell you what, you guys just . . . 

00:38:10
SCOTT MILLER So Nancy had--let me make sure I get this. Nancy wanted to go, no, Nancy . . . 

00:38:15
PATIENT SCOTT Wanted to go shopping. 

00:38:15
SCOTT MILLER Shopping, okay. 

00:38:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:38:15
SCOTT MILLER Because of the rain, she didn't want to sit out in the rain or . . . 

00:38:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:38:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. All right. 

00:38:20
PATIENT SCOTT And I was kind of hop--, planning on them to go fishing with me . . . 

00:38:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:38:20
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and I was going to in, we'd eat dinner or whatever, you know. 

00:38:25
SCOTT MILLER Have a good time. 

00:38:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:38:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:38:25
PATIENT SCOTT Well, they changed the whole plan. Like, just go. 

00:38:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:38:30
PATIENT SCOTT And I'll, I'm doing what I want to do, you do what you want to do. 

00:38:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:38:35
PATIENT SCOTT And it worked out real good. 

00:38:35
SCOTT MILLER It did? 

00:38:35
PATIENT SCOTT They come back and picked me up at 3:30, we went out and had a real nice dinner. 

00:38:40
SCOTT MILLER So they dropped you off at the spot. 

00:38:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, they dropped me off with the boat in the lake and I went off and did my thing, went fishing all day. 

00:38:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:38:45
PATIENT SCOTT And they come back and hooked up to the trailer when they got back and they were ready when I come in, they were ready to go. 

00:38:55
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:38:55
PATIENT SCOTT Went back to town, cleaned up and went out for a nice steak dinner and everything went just slick as a whistle. 

00:38:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Now that could have turned into a problem in the past. 

00:39:00
PATIENT SCOTT It could have, yeah. 

00:39:00
2-16 

00:39:00
SCOTT MILLER How--do--what was different? How come, you know, this time? 

00:39:00
PATIENT SCOTT We discussed the sit--what was going on. 

00:39:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:39:05
PATIENT SCOTT And, ah, communication. 

00:39:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:39:10
PATIENT SCOTT And it seems like when we have problems, or even at work, it's just the lack of communication. 

00:39:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:39:15
PATIENT SCOTT It, it seems like anyhow. That's just the way I interpret it. 

00:39:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:39:15
PATIENT SCOTT And it's helpful a lot. Just being able to talk with people. 

00:39:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:20
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz when I was in high school, I couldn't sit down and talk to nobody. Like what we've doing tonight. 

00:39:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:25
PATIENT SCOTT I was a shy person. I couldn't talk to nobody. And . . . 

00:39:30
SCOTT MILLER Really? 

00:39:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . since I got into the construction business, there ain't nobody I can't talk to. 

00:39:35
SCOTT MILLER Well, so that's even helped, the kind of work you do. 

00:39:35
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Uh-huh. 

00:39:35
SCOTT MILLER Because? 

00:39:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. I can, I can talk to anybody now. 

00:39:40
SCOTT MILLER I mean, how has that happened? A lot of people might have just said, well screw that, you know. 

00:39:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:39:45
SCOTT MILLER I'm going to get out of the construction business then. But you didn't do that. 

00:39:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-uh. And it started out, I was working the top for--and I didn't really know a lot of the people I was working with . . . 

00:39:50
PATIENT SCOTT . . . but just over time, I got to know them good. 

00:39:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:55
PATIENT SCOTT And then the boss would put me in charge of . . . 

00:39:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:39:55
PATIENT SCOTT . . . like public relations, telling people we're going to shut their water off. 

00:40:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:40:00
2-17 

00:40:00
PATIENT SCOTT And if somebody come up, inspectors and stuff like that, I always had to, to deal with them people. 

00:40:05
SCOTT MILLER The people who were mad or the inspectors. 

00:40:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right, right. 

00:40:05
SCOTT MILLER Oh. 

00:40:05
PATIENT SCOTT And so, you know, it--and after a while, you just, you just learn to, to deal with the people and you just don't let it bother you. 

00:40:15
SCOTT MILLER So . . . 

00:40:15
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes it's real tough. 

00:40:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:15
PATIENT SCOTT Somebody's calling you an SOB or something, you know. 

00:40:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:20
PATIENT SCOTT You know, I'm sorry sir, but I didn't, you know, we didn't plan on having the water main break. 

00:40:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:40:20
PATIENT SCOTT But it happened. 

00:40:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:25
PATIENT SCOTT We'll try to get it back as soon as we can and we'll go from there. Sorry for the inconvenience and all and if you treat people good, most of the time, they'll treat you real good. 

00:40:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:40:35
PATIENT SCOTT But you've always good a few that don't. 

00:40:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:40:35
PATIENT SCOTT But it keeps it interesting. There's no doubt . . . 

00:40:40
SCOTT MILLER Well I . . . 

00:40:40
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz you don't know when you're going to go knock on the door . . . 

00:40:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:40
PATIENT SCOTT . . . is this guy going to rip me or is he going to offer me a cup of coffee. 

00:40:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:40:45
PATIENT SCOTT You know. 

00:40:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:40:45
PATIENT SCOTT So it's a challenge. 

00:40:45
SCOTT MILLER You kind of had to overcome that. 

00:40:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:40:50
SCOTT MILLER That challenge. 

00:40:50
PATIENT SCOTT It's easy now. Ain't nothing to it. 

00:40:50
SCOTT MILLER But at--would you have said that, let's say, let's say, let's say you back in high school. 

00:40:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:40:55
SCOTT MILLER And you would have thought--sort of imagined that that's the kind of work you would have been doing. What would, I mean, what would happen then? 

00:41:00
2-18 

00:41:00
PATIENT SCOTT I would have been a big chicken then. I wouldn't have went to the door. I would have had a real hard time with it. 

00:41:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:41:05
PATIENT SCOTT It would have been real hard. 

00:41:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:41:05
PATIENT SCOTT There was one day we couldn't get a guy out of bed. 

00:41:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:10
PATIENT SCOTT And we had to have his cars moved. And I'm pounding on the door pretty loud. 

00:41:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:41:15
PATIENT SCOTT Well, the boss, he comes down there, boom, boom, boom. I mean the whole house was rattling. And this guy come out swearing and everything else at us. 

00:41:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:41:20
PATIENT SCOTT I said, I'll talk to you later. I'm going. 

00:41:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:25
PATIENT SCOTT I'm going back to the job. 

00:41:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:25
PATIENT SCOTT And after you see how they handle it . . . 

00:41:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . you kind of, you learn a lot from it. 

00:41:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:41:30
PATIENT SCOTT Just seeing how other people handle the situation and it works real good. 

00:41:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. I mean this is a theme that, ah, has come up a couple of times here, even in the short time we've been talking, that, that, uhm, first off, it, it you know, you, you're, you're cautious. 

00:41:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:41:45
SCOTT MILLER You take your time. You don't jump in. Usually, that means you're up to here in something not nice. 

00:41:50
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Uh-huh. 

00:41:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And the second thing you do, it seems like, and if there's more let me know, it seems like you, you, ah, you're very observant. 

00:42:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:42:00
SCOTT MILLER You watch how other people do stuff and then you . . . 

00:42:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:42:00
2-19 

00:42:05
SCOTT MILLER . . . you apply that in your life. And then this last part is that even though, even when you do sort of develop a strong relationship, uhm . . . 

00:42:10
PATIENT SCOTT I'm always looking over my shoulder. 

00:42:15
SCOTT MILLER You keep--you're watching your back side. 

00:42:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:42:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay. 

00:42:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. And that kind of, it's--I suppose it's good in a way but I, I'm kind of, it makes me timid to jump into a relationship and well, you know, this is the way it's going to be. 

00:42:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:42:25
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz it's, it's tough. You know, knowing that everybody's been divorced and this and that. 

00:42:30
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:42:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it, it makes it tough. 

00:42:30
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

00:42:35
PATIENT SCOTT I'm just trying to look out for both of us, not just for me. I don't want her to have to go through it or me. 

00:42:40
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:42:40
PATIENT SCOTT So . . . 

00:42:40
SCOTT MILLER I mean, given all the divorces and stuff you've seen . . . 

00:42:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:42:40
SCOTT MILLER The multiple remarriages. 

00:42:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:42:45
SCOTT MILLER The pain that goes with that. 

00:42:45
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:42:45
SCOTT MILLER I mean, this makes a person cautious. 

00:42:45
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Uh-huh. Cuz I--my mother brought me up since I was a little kid. 

00:42:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:42:50
PATIENT SCOTT So I see more of her side of it than anybody else's. And it--I know if I'd done half the stuff that my father did, I'd of killed him. 

00:42:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:42:55
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:43:00
PATIENT SCOTT You mean because he hurt your mom? 

00:43:00
2-20 

00:43:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. That way. If I was as big now, you know, if I was then, I'd--he probably wouldn't be alive today. I'd have killed him for the stuff he's done. 

00:43:05
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Hmm. 

00:43:10
PATIENT SCOTT And that--I don't, I don't appreciate that kind of stuff. 

00:43:10
SCOTT MILLER In, in a way then, you're sort of protecting . . . 

00:43:10
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:43:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . Nancy? 

00:43:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:43:15
SCOTT MILLER You don't want anything in the world to hurt her? 

00:43:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:43:15
SCOTT MILLER Does she know that about you? 

00:43:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, but she won't listen to me. 

00:43:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:43:20
PATIENT SCOTT She just thinks I'm full of bologna. 

00:43:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

00:43:20
PATIENT SCOTT But she's gradually learning. 

00:43:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:43:25
PATIENT SCOTT So . . . 

00:43:25
SCOTT MILLER So it's, it's taking some time. 

00:43:25
PATIENT SCOTT Oh yeah. Lot of time. 

00:43:30
SCOTT MILLER And, and you're talking together a little bit more. 

00:43:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:43:30
SCOTT MILLER You're communicating a little bit more. You're playing these things to your . . . 

00:43:35
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:43:35
SCOTT MILLER . . . uhm, do things seem to be on the way in that? 

00:43:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:43:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Hmm. 

00:43:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. So, I don't know, if everything goes--it looks like we're planning probably in January or February, we'll be married if everything goes decent. 

00:43:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:43:50
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz where she, she told me about it, where she works, the highest sales people, they're--they send them to Vegas for--I don't know how many day trip . . . 

00:43:55
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:43:55
PATIENT SCOTT . . . on them. 

00:43:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:44:00
PATIENT SCOTT And she said, why spend the money to go to Vegas to get married? If everything goes right, let the company pay for it. 

00:44:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:44:05
2-21 

00:44:05
PATIENT SCOTT If that's the way you want to do it, that's fine with me. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:44:10
PATIENT SCOTT Well, so it sounds real good to me. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:44:10
PATIENT SCOTT So . . . 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So the plan is then to go ahead . . . 

00:44:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:44:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . and go to Vegas . . . 

00:44:15
PATIENT SCOTT And get married. 

00:44:15
SCOTT MILLER During when everybody--your schedule . . . 

00:44:15
PATIENT SCOTT In the wintertime, yeah. 

00:44:20
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

00:44:20
PATIENT SCOTT That way, I don't miss a bunch of work and she don't either and it'll work out good for both of us. 

00:44:25
SCOTT MILLER Wow. Wow. It's incredible. 

00:44:25
PATIENT SCOTT I hope everything works out good. 

00:44:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. How, I mean, it seems like you're fairly, I mean, maybe I'm wrong about this, but it seems like you sort of have this clear vision about where you want things to go. 

00:44:35
PATIENT SCOTT Not always. 

00:44:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:44:35
PATIENT SCOTT And I--I don't now, in the last six months, it's gotten better. 

00:44:40
SCOTT MILLER It has. 

00:44:40
PATIENT SCOTT But, I don't know, I'm--I never usually plan too far ahead. 

00:44:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:44:40
PATIENT SCOTT I know in the spring and in the fall I'm in the field farming. 

00:44:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:44:45
PATIENT SCOTT And then, you know, the rest of it, I, I kind of fly by as when it gets done, it gets done. 

00:44:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. What's gotten better about the situation in the last six months in terms of this part? 

00:44:55
PATIENT SCOTT Well, communication wise. 

00:44:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:44:55
PATIENT SCOTT It's just gotten a lot better because we can, seems like, I don't know, I'd say we're both growed up a little bit and we've learned now, we've got to talk to each other . . . 

00:45:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:45:05
2-22 

00:45:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to make it work. 

00:45:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:45:10
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz she's 30--39 years old. 

00:45:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:10
PATIENT SCOTT Or 38. 

00:45:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:45:10
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm only 30. 

00:45:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:15
PATIENT SCOTT So it--there's a little bit of an age difference. You know, and, like I said, she's been married twice, so she's a little bit further along, you know, in what it takes to make a relationship work. 

00:45:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:25
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm still trying to learn this stuff. 

00:45:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay, you're catching up. 

00:45:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh, I'm trying to catch up here. 

00:45:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

00:45:30
PATIENT SCOTT And some of the stuff I'm learning and sometimes I'm not. 

00:45:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:45:35
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes I'm a little slow at it and, you know, I take--try to do the best that I can with what I got. 

00:45:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:45
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes it works out real good and sometimes it don't. 

00:45:45
SCOTT MILLER Sometimes it doesn't. 

00:45:45
PATIENT SCOTT It causes a few waves but we try to learn from it. 

00:45:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:45:50
PATIENT SCOTT And say well, okay, this didn't work, why didn't it? 

00:45:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:45:50
PATIENT SCOTT You know. And sometimes, you know, I push too hard or she did. 

00:45:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:45:55
PATIENT SCOTT Or just, you know, something like that. 

00:45:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:45:55
PATIENT SCOTT Just something minor usually is what causes the biggest problems for us. 

00:46:00
SCOTT MILLER Is that what gives you the hope that things will . . . 

00:46:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, cuz I know we can work things out. 

00:46:05
2-23 

00:46:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. What, what is it about you and her that makes you think that in addition to these changes, what, what gives you the hope about that? 

00:46:10
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

00:46:15
SCOTT MILLER I mean, I can really feel it as I listen to you talk. 

00:46:15
PATIENT SCOTT We like a lot of the same things. 

00:46:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:46:15
PATIENT SCOTT And she likes to go fishing. 

00:46:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:46:20
PATIENT SCOTT She likes to be outside. 

00:46:20
SCOTT MILLER Unless it's raining. 

00:46:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, unless it's raining. You got it. She don't like to fish them 14, 15 hour days either. 

00:46:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:46:25
PATIENT SCOTT And a lot of people don't. 

00:46:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:46:30
PATIENT SCOTT So, and she likes the horses. 

00:46:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:46:30
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz I used to team rope. 

00:46:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:46:30
PATIENT SCOTT And she likes that part of it. 

00:46:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:46:35
PATIENT SCOTT And she basically likes to be out there in the country where I'm at, and that's ideally where I like to be. 

00:46:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:46:40
PATIENT SCOTT I don't like it up where there's a lot of people and she don't either. So we've got a lot of things that, you know, we like the same. 

00:46:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:46:45
PATIENT SCOTT And she don't mind my big fish tank or nothing like that. 

00:46:50
SCOTT MILLER You got a big fish tank? 

00:46:50
PATIENT SCOTT A hundred thirty-five gallon. 

00:46:50
SCOTT MILLER Wow. Salt water or fresh? 

00:46:55
PATIENT SCOTT Salt. 

00:46:55
SCOTT MILLER Salt. 

00:46:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I like to tinker with that kind of stuff so it, you know, it gets kind of expensive but she likes it too so . . . 

00:47:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:47:00
PATIENT SCOTT It gives us both something to, to deal with in the wintertime and . . . 

00:47:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:47:05
PATIENT SCOTT It's nice. 

00:47:05
SCOTT MILLER What would you say she likes about you? 

00:47:05
2-24 

00:47:05
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea. I don't know. I have to really . . . 

00:47:10
SCOTT MILLER If I sort of had her off in a private moment and I say, now look at the guy over there. 

00:47:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
SCOTT MILLER You know, what is it about him? 

00:47:15
PATIENT SCOTT She'd probably say she likes that I, I help everybody out. You know, she likes part of it that I help everybody . . . 

00:47:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:47:20
PATIENT SCOTT . . . but she don't like because a lot of times, I won't get the stuff done for her. 

00:47:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:47:25
PATIENT SCOTT You know, that way and, like I say, she's starting to learn that I won't, don't let nothing happen to her. 

00:47:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:47:30
PATIENT SCOTT I go out--try to go out of my way to help out anybody I can. 

00:47:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:47:35
PATIENT SCOTT Even, you know, if her mother needs something. 

00:47:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:47:35
PATIENT SCOTT I go over there and help her out all I can. 

00:47:40
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:47:40
PATIENT SCOTT And she likes that. 

00:47:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. She can see you have a really good spirit and all. 

00:47:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Uh-huh. 

00:47:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 

00:47:45
PATIENT SCOTT She calls me up, I go over her house and I work, you know, I work more there than I do at my own house most of the time. 

00:47:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And you're also kind of generous it sounds like. 

00:47:55
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes. 

00:47:55
SCOTT MILLER With your time and . . . 

00:47:55
PATIENT SCOTT Like I said, most of the time I get stuff done for everybody else and I don't get own stuff done. 

00:48:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:48:00
2-25 

00:48:00
PATIENT SCOTT But, I don't know, like last winter, it, it got to me and I said, I was wondering, do--I'm I here just because you want me to help you to fix up your place or is it that you want me to be here? And it, you know, caused some problems but when we talked it all out and all, she wanted me there. 

00:48:15
SCOTT MILLER Tell me more about this moment because it sounds like a kind of . . . 

00:48:15
PATIENT SCOTT We had, you know, it was tough. 

00:48:20
PATIENT SCOTT . . . important. Okay, tell me, when was this? 

00:48:20
PATIENT SCOTT It was like this early spring, last winter. 

00:48:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:48:25
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:48:25
SCOTT MILLER You'd been apart then for about . . . 

00:48:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:48:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . six months or so. 

00:48:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Right. 

00:48:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:48:25
PATIENT SCOTT And it was kind of tough because I, you know, I thought maybe, you know, that was the only reason she wanted me back too . . . 

00:48:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:48:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . is just to kind of help her out . . . 

00:48:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:48:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to get her house fixed up and this. 

00:48:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:48:35
PATIENT SCOTT And--cuz I was working there every night after work, I'd go there and I'd try to work on this or that. 

00:48:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:48:40
PATIENT SCOTT And it was starting to get to me. 

00:48:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:48:45
PATIENT SCOTT You know, is this, like I say, the only reason you want me here. 

00:48:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:48:45
PATIENT SCOTT And after I thought about it and talked with her, and I realized, you know, that wasn't the thing that, you know, she didn't just want me there to help her out for that part. She wanted me there for moral support and, you know, being together . . . 

00:49:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:49:00
PATIENT SCOTT And that kind of stuff. So . . . 

00:49:05
SCOTT MILLER She convinced you that . . . 

00:49:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:49:05
SCOTT MILLER . . . thing convinced you. What was it? That seems, that sounds important because otherwise . . . 

00:49:10
PATIENT SCOTT I don't know. 

00:49:10
2-26 

00:49:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . you know, I could understand you hanging back and saying, God, you know . . . 

00:49:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:49:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . I'm basically a lackey here. I get to, you know. 

00:49:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:49:15
SCOTT MILLER I do all this stuff and I don't, I don't need this. I got a job. 

00:49:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:49:15
SCOTT MILLER What, what was it about that that really sort of helped you for--feel more like . . . 

00:49:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uhm, I don't know, I don't really know what it was. 

00:49:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:49:25
PATIENT SCOTT I mean it--cuz I like to just to be around her . . . 

00:49:30
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:49:30
PATIENT SCOTT Just sit around and watch a little TV in the evening or something. 

00:49:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, but you weren't willing to just hang out and keep doing stuff for her unless . . . 

00:49:30
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I was getting to the point, right . . . 

00:49:35
SCOTT MILLER . . . that you were going to say . . . 

00:49:35
PATIENT SCOTT And I didn't want to. 

00:49:35
SCOTT MILLER No. 

00:49:35
PATIENT SCOTT Because she means too much to lose . . . 

00:49:40
SCOTT MILLER She does? 

00:49:40
PATIENT SCOTT . . . her for that. 

00:49:40
SCOTT MILLER She does? 

00:49:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. So, I don't know, I guess it's just, you know, something inside of me. 

00:49:45
SCOTT MILLER Was there something she said or how you talk. I mean, how did that happen? I mean, it seems . . . 

00:49:50
PATIENT SCOTT I don't, I don't really know. 

00:49:50
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:49:50
PATIENT SCOTT It just kind of happened, you know, over a couple of weeks. It just happened, you know, she quit ask--I told her, you know, can I just have a break. I don't mind helping you. And she realized too that, you know, maybe she was pushing me a little bit too hard to come there every night and work. 

00:50:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:50:05
2-27 

00:50:05
PATIENT SCOTT I was working every day at my normal job and then I'd come there and work for two or three hours a night. 

00:50:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:50:15
PATIENT SCOTT You know, not doing a lot but just odd jobs, you know. 

00:50:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:50:15
PATIENT SCOTT Tinkering. And I'd usually have dinner on the table by the time she got home and all that kind of stuff. So I, you know, it was it was getting on me. 

00:50:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. But you brought it up to her? 

00:50:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:50:30
SCOTT MILLER You somehow said can I have a break. 

00:50:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. And that--I think she realized, you know, hey maybe I'm pushing him a little bit too much here. 

00:50:35
PATIENT SCOTT Okay. 

00:50:35
PATIENT SCOTT You know, because we'd have problems and she didn't want to push away me too much either. 

00:50:40
SCOTT MILLER That's what it communicated to you? 

00:50:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:50:40
SCOTT MILLER When she, when, when you said it to her and then she responded, then somehow you knew she didn't want you to go away . . . 

00:50:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Uh-huh. 

00:50:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . either. She was willing to say, okay, don't do the work. Just come over. 

00:50:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:50:50
SCOTT MILLER I mean, is that . . . 

00:50:50
PATIENT SCOTT That's how it ended up. 

00:50:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:50:50
PATIENT SCOTT And then, you know, gradually I got her to come out to my place and help me a little bit. So then it started working out. You know, I'd come up here and help her a little bit and on the weekend or whatever, she'd come out and help me. 

00:51:00
SCOTT MILLER So more back and forth. 

00:51:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, instead of just me coming up here helping . . . 

00:51:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:51:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . now she'll come out and help me in the garden now, or different things. So it helps. Or she'll help me with my grocery shopping. 

00:51:15
2-28 

00:51:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:51:15
PATIENT SCOTT God, that's got to be the worst thing there is, grocery shopping. 

00:51:20
SCOTT MILLER Why don't you like it? I know why I don't like it. 

00:51:20
PATIENT SCOTT I just hate it. I don't--if I can just go in and get what I need, it wouldn't be so bad. But when you got to stand in line for 20 minutes behind somebody that don't a clue what they're doing. 

00:51:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:30
PATIENT SCOTT It . . . 

00:51:30
SCOTT MILLER And their thing piled this high. 

00:51:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, you're in an isle says 15 and under and this--they got a cart full. 

00:51:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:35
PATIENT SCOTT And you're trying to get half a dozen things. I get one day off and I've got do--stand in line behind somebody that's like this. 

00:51:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh, yeah. 

00:51:45
PATIENT SCOTT It just gets irritating. 

00:51:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Tell, tell me about it. 

00:51:50
PATIENT SCOTT I--you can tell me what to cook. I can cook about anything you want me to cook. 

00:51:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:51:50
PATIENT SCOTT But just--I, I just hate going to get it. 

00:51:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. So it seems like it--at that moment then, you, you mentioned it, somehow finally . . . 

00:52:00
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, we just compromised . . . 

00:52:05
SCOTT MILLER . . . and compromised. 

00:52:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and went from there. Yeah. 

00:52:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:52:05
PATIENT SCOTT And it worked out real good. 

00:52:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. And then from that, given that you seem to, I mean, you seem to take a lot from your experience. 

00:52:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:52:15
2-29 

00:52:15
SCOTT MILLER And put it to practical use. And you, you've been trying to communicate. 

00:52:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:52:20
SCOTT MILLER Notice when there's a concern . . . 

00:52:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:52:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . rather than letting it fester or . . . 

00:52:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. And talk--yeah, talk about it before it ever gets bad. 

00:52:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:52:25
PATIENT SCOTT You know, instead--catch it when it's here instead of here. 

00:52:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:52:25
PATIENT SCOTT And it, it's working real good. 

00:52:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:52:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uhm, try-, trying not to let things bother me like they used to. 

00:52:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:52:35
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz I used to be bad about that. I'd just let things burn up inside of me. 

00:52:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:52:40
PATIENT SCOTT And, and then, and my guts would be turning and everything else. 

00:52:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:52:40
PATIENT SCOTT And then try not to do that anymore. 

00:52:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. And the way that happens is again you, you, you talk about it or you take one of these breaks . . . 

00:52:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:52:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . go out outside, hang out. 

00:52:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. I used to go lift a lot of weights and stuff like that. Now my back hurts. I don't do that no more either. 

00:52:55
SCOTT MILLER That was a way to sort of diffuse some of that? 

00:52:55
PATIENT SCOTT It took a lot the pressure off. 

00:53:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:53:00
PATIENT SCOTT Instead of, you know, saying stuff I didn't want to and hurting somebody. 

00:53:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:53:00
PATIENT SCOTT I just, I'd go in the basement and I'd pumped iron for hour or something. 

00:53:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:53:05
PATIENT SCOTT And then when you're wore out, you don't feel like arguing, you know, you're going to go sit and talk about it. 

00:53:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. 

00:53:10
PATIENT SCOTT It helps. 

00:53:10
SCOTT MILLER Well, I mean, it seems like things are on the road . . . 

00:53:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:53:15
2-30 

00:53:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . a bit. What would, I mean, I would tell you or make you feel confident about those things continuing? I mean, for you? I mean, or are you confident? 

00:53:25
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I'm, I'm sure things are going to keep wor-, going the right way. 

00:53:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:25
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz, like I say, we, we, we've had rough times. 

00:53:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:30
PATIENT SCOTT In that five years, we had some . . . 

00:53:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . real rough times, but we've always come through them and I believe that if, you got to learn from your mistakes. 

00:53:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:40
PATIENT SCOTT But if you keep screwing up the same way all the time, there's something wrong. 

00:53:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:40
PATIENT SCOTT But, you know, we, we try our darndest to learn. Say well, this was how we screwed up the last time, this is our problem. 

00:53:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:53:50
PATIENT SCOTT Let's try not to do that anymore. And we'll go from there. 

00:53:50
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:53:50
PATIENT SCOTT Sure, we may screw up again. But we're going to do the best we can. 

00:53:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:53:55
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz the-- there's no relationship that's perfect. 

00:54:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So the part that gives you confidence is that you're, you're observant. 

00:54:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:54:05
SCOTT MILLER You learn from your experience. 

00:54:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:54:05
SCOTT MILLER You think stuff out. 

00:54:05
PATIENT SCOTT Try to anyhow. 

00:54:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Okay. Well, you know, nobody's . . . 

00:54:10
PATIENT SCOTT Right, nobody's perfect. 

00:54:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . perfect. Yeah. 

00:54:10
2-31 

00:54:10
PATIENT SCOTT And now that she's got a job that she likes, it makes it a whole lot easier for me. Cuz when somebody comes home and is ragging on you as soon as you walk in the door . . . 

00:54:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:54:20
PATIENT SCOTT That--you don't even want to go home at night. 

00:54:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. Tell me, tell me about that? What, what happened? 

00:54:25
PATIENT SCOTT Like when she was living with me . . . 

00:54:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:54:25
PATIENT SCOTT And she lot of times wouldn't get home until seven o'clock or something like that. 

00:54:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:54:30
PATIENT SCOTT Well, if I'd stop somewhere on the way home . . . 

00:54:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:54:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and the first thing, well you stopped and had a couple beers, didn't you. And just continually rag on me. 

00:54:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:54:40
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz the one guy she was married to was an alcoholic. 

00:54:40
SCOTT MILLER Oh. 

00:54:40
PATIENT SCOTT It always rubbed her wrong if I had a couple of beers. 

00:54:45
SCOTT MILLER Before you came home? 

00:54:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:54:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:54:45
PATIENT SCOTT But now, she's learned too that I'm not out messing around with nobody. 

00:54:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:54:50
PATIENT SCOTT And if I stop, I stop for one or two beers and that's it and I come home. 

00:54:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:54:55
PATIENT SCOTT And she's learned, you know, that I'm not out to hurt her. 

00:54:55
SCOTT MILLER But why did she stop ragging? I mean, she's learned about--how, how did, how did you help her see that about you because she didn't have to worry about--how did. . . 

00:55:05
PATIENT SCOTT Well, we discussed it. I told her, I'm not your ex-husband. I don't ever want to be. 

00:55:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:55:10
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:55:10
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . I'm not out to hurt you. 

00:55:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:55:15
PATIENT SCOTT If I stop, it's just I want to have a couple beers and then I'm going to come home. 

00:55:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:15
2-32 

00:55:15
PATIENT SCOTT And I'll help cook dinner or whatever. 

00:55:20
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:20
PATIENT SCOTT And I'll help take care of everything else that's got to be done. 

00:55:20
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:20
PATIENT SCOTT And I, you know, she realized after a while that, you know, hey I get, I get more done at night than what most people do. And she finally . . . 

00:55:30
SCOTT MILLER During the day. 

00:55:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Like working two jobs anymore. 

00:55:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Right. 

00:55:35
PATIENT SCOTT I work from--usually from six o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night. 

00:55:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:40
PATIENT SCOTT So it, it's not the lack of working. 

00:55:40
SCOTT MILLER No. 

00:55:40
PATIENT SCOTT I catch heck because I work too much. 

00:55:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:55:45
PATIENT SCOTT And, you know, how come you didn't come see me tonight. Well, I got all this stuff that's got to get done. 

00:55:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:55:50
PATIENT SCOTT You know, it, it causes problems sometimes, but . . . 

00:55:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:55:55
PATIENT SCOTT And it's real-, she's realizing a little bit, it's not that I don't want to come see her, no. 

00:55:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:55:55
PATIENT SCOTT And that was part of the problem before, she thought, you know, I was just pushing her off. 

00:56:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:00
PATIENT SCOTT And I could see her point. 

00:56:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:05
PATIENT SCOTT You know, that I was working all these hours, she thought that. 

00:56:05
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:56:05
PATIENT SCOTT And, and it took a little bit to sink in my head. 

00:56:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:56:10
PATIENT SCOTT You know, that I was, instead me actually helping us both . . . 

00:56:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:56:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . I was actually hurting her. 

00:56:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:56:15
2-33 

00:56:15
PATIENT SCOTT And then, I guess I had to learn, you know, by her not being there, losing what I wanted . . . 

00:56:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:20
PATIENT SCOTT You know, hey, if I keep doing what I'm doing, there's going to be no chance. 

00:56:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:56:25
PATIENT SCOTT And I've learned from it. 

00:56:25
SCOTT MILLER And that's what it was, sort of, sort of recognizing what you had and what you wanted . . . 

00:56:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:56:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . for in the future. 

00:56:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:56:30
SCOTT MILLER That's what helps things . . . 

00:56:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:56:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . sort of just sink in. 

00:56:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:56:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:56:35
PATIENT SCOTT You know, there's things that I do and things she does that we don't always see eye to eye on. 

00:56:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, of course. Welcome the world of relationships. 

00:56:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right, so it, it's going though. It's . . . 

00:56:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:45
PATIENT SCOTT It's helped me. 

00:56:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:56:45
PATIENT SCOTT And it helps her. 

00:56:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And what else, you know, what, uhm, what, anything else that, uhm, ah, makes you feel confident about the next three or four months that things will continue or, uhm . . . 

00:57:00
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't know how . . . 

00:57:00
SCOTT MILLER Will there be signs that were continuing, you know, small signs that you were . . . 

00:57:05
PATIENT SCOTT Well, like she was always saying that I was, you know, I was kind of afraid of commit to her. 

00:57:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:57:10
PATIENT SCOTT Well, since I've asked her to marry me . . . 

00:57:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . things have really, you know, they've--we've progressed and we've went kind of to the next level. 

00:57:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:15
PATIENT SCOTT And things are going real good. I mean, they're smooth. 

00:57:20
2-34 

00:57:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. And you--how do you feel about that decision? I mean, I mean . . . 

00:57:20
PATIENT SCOTT Well, it . . . 

00:57:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . where--what happened to all this, ah, fear of commitment and indecision and . . . 

00:57:25
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

00:57:25
SCOTT MILLER I mean, did you just finally weigh it carefully enough that it made sense to you? 

00:57:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, I think so. And all the thinking about it, you know, I've run all this stuff through my head. 

00:57:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:35
PATIENT SCOTT You know, laying there every night . . . 

00:57:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and not sleeping for a week. 

00:57:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:35
PATIENT SCOTT I don't know, you . . . 

00:57:40
SCOTT MILLER You really thought about it. Does she know that? 

00:57:40
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:57:40
SCOTT MILLER She did? 

00:57:40
PATIENT SCOTT I don't think she believes it. 

00:57:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:57:45
PATIENT SCOTT You know. 

00:57:45
SCOTT MILLER She wanted what she wanted. 

00:57:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:57:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:57:45
PATIENT SCOTT You know, she just thinks that it was, you know, something I just said, well, we're going to do it. Well no, this is something that, you know, that, I just didn't start tonight thinking about it. 

00:57:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:57:55
PATIENT SCOTT I mean this has been going through my mind . . . 

00:57:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:57:55
PATIENT SCOTT . . . for a long time. 

00:57:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:58:00
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

00:58:00
SCOTT MILLER Does she see that about you that--any of that? 

00:58:00
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:58:00
SCOTT MILLER That you carefully weigh things? 

00:58:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

00:58:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. I mean it's irritating at times I guess. 

00:58:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:58:05
SCOTT MILLER But . . . 

00:58:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, she says do what you're saying, I'm too observant. I see too many things that are going on, you know, and probably sometimes that's good and sometimes it's not. 

00:58:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:58:15
2-35 

00:58:15
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz I, I read more into it than what a person should a lot of times. 

00:58:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:58:20
PATIENT SCOTT You know, it gets me in trouble. 

00:58:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:58:25
PATIENT SCOTT But it's . . . 

00:58:25
SCOTT MILLER How do you deal with that when that--when it happens? 

00:58:25
PATIENT SCOTT Well, most of the time, we just talk about it. 

00:58:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:58:30
PATIENT SCOTT You know, either when I'm at work or at, at home. It works out. 

00:58:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:58:35
PATIENT SCOTT You know. 

00:58:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:58:35
PATIENT SCOTT Lot of times, like I say, I see a lot more . . . 

00:58:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:58:40
PATIENT SCOTT . . . than, than what a lot of people do. 

00:58:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:58:40
PATIENT SCOTT And, and, and it's good and bad. 

00:58:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Well, you're . . . 

00:58:45
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm always looking over my shoulder of what--who's doing what and how they doing it. 

00:58:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:58:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, so and I tell people at work, I'm not telling you how to do your job. 

00:58:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:58:55
PATIENT SCOTT I'm just trying to help you out. 

00:58:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

00:58:55
PATIENT SCOTT And try to make people smile. 

00:59:00
SCOTT MILLER Sure. 

00:59:00
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz that--that's what makes me happy . . . 

00:59:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:59:00
PATIENT SCOTT . . . is to see other people smile. 

00:59:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, of course. 

00:59:05
PATIENT SCOTT And I try to make them laugh. 

00:59:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:59:05
PATIENT SCOTT And it, some people told me, you gotta, there's something that's always holding you back and you, you always try to feed off everybody else smiling. 

00:59:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:59:15
PATIENT SCOTT But that's what makes me happy is to see everybody else smiling having a good time. 

00:59:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. 

00:59:20
PATIENT SCOTT If they're having a good time . . . 

00:59:20
SCOTT MILLER It makes you genuinely happy. 

00:59:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, I'm . . . 

00:59:20
2-36 

00:59:20
SCOTT MILLER And then to hell with those other people. 

00:59:25
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:59:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:59:25
PATIENT SCOTT If you can't have a good time, then, you know, you don't, I don't want you around. 

00:59:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:59:30
PATIENT SCOTT That's why I like to see, everybody smiling. We'd laugh at work. 

00:59:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:59:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it's stuff like that. 

00:59:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:59:35
PATIENT SCOTT And I try to do that with, with Nancy or anybody I'm around . . . 

00:59:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

00:59:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to make them smile. 

00:59:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:59:40
PATIENT SCOTT And sometimes I don't succeed but I have a good time anyhow. 

00:59:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. What makes you confident that you'll be able to continue having smiles with Nancy over the next six months on the way to Vegas? 

00:59:45
PATIENT SCOTT Well, uhm, I think some of its cuz she's starting to see a little of my humor. 

00:59:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay, she's seeing that. 

00:59:55
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:59:55
SCOTT MILLER So it's not all you? 

00:59:55
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:59:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. There's also some other stuff. 

00:59:55
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

00:59:55
SCOTT MILLER You're observing these changes? 

01:00:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Right. 

01:00:00
SCOTT MILLER Part of that's because you're communicating more. 

01:00:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:00:00
SCOTT MILLER But it's also you're seeing a change on her. 

01:00:05
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:00:05
SCOTT MILLER That effects your confidence level. 

01:00:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Right. 

01:00:05
SCOTT MILLER It deepens your sense of commitment. 

01:00:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:00:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:10
PATIENT SCOTT And knowing that my temper isn't near as bad. 

01:00:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:00:15
PATIENT SCOTT That helps me. 

01:00:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. You're confident about that as well? 

01:00:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, I'm getting a lot better with, a whole lot better. 

01:00:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:15
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz it, and I always said to heck with it. 

01:00:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:00:20
2-37 

01:00:20
PATIENT SCOTT Talk it out or just we'll go from there somehow or another. 

01:00:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:00:25
PATIENT SCOTT And it works out. 

01:00:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:25
PATIENT SCOTT You know, and, I don't know how it happens but it does. 

01:00:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. That's good. 

01:00:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, so. 

01:00:35
SCOTT MILLER That's good. 

01:00:35
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes I do have a hard time making a decision. 

01:00:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:00:35
PATIENT SCOTT I know, I know that. 

01:00:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:00:40
PATIENT SCOTT I let, I let somebody else make the decision, where we're going for dinner or what we're going to have. 

01:00:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:00:45
PATIENT SCOTT And that kind of stuff, it don't bother me. 

01:00:45
SCOTT MILLER That's right. 

01:00:45
PATIENT SCOTT If you want to go here, hey that's fine. And that kind of little stuff, it--I don't know. 

01:00:50
SCOTT MILLER The little stuff doesn't bother you too much? 

01:00:50
PATIENT SCOTT No, not really. 

01:00:50
SCOTT MILLER The major decisions . . . 

01:00:55
PATIENT SCOTT I say we'll work on them together. 

01:00:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Oh. 

01:00:55
PATIENT SCOTT Or try to anyhow. 

01:01:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:01:00
PATIENT SCOTT And like if this is the way, all right, you want to do it now . . . 

01:01:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:01:00
PATIENT SCOTT . . . all right, well, you know, there ain't no one I can do it. How about instead of doing it at three o'clock, can we do it at 2:30? 

01:01:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:01:05
PATIENT SCOTT Or we'll compromise or something like that. 

01:01:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:01:10
PATIENT SCOTT That, that works out real good. 

01:01:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:01:10
PATIENT SCOTT Or, or usually, not always but . . . 

01:01:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Signs in Nancy that will tell you that you can check your back side a little less? 

01:01:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, usually, yeah. 

01:01:20
2-38 

01:01:20
SCOTT MILLER What? What kinds of signs will you be noticing in the next six months that you can sort of feel comfortable with your decision? 

01:01:25
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't--she always call me now. 

01:01:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:01:30
PATIENT SCOTT You know, and wonders, you know, you know, did I get home all right or, uhm . . . 

01:01:35
SCOTT MILLER What started that happening? I mean, because you were mostly calling her, mostly coming over. 

01:01:40
YEAH. 

01:01:40
SCOTT MILLER Mostly cooking her meals, suddenly she's calling you. 

01:01:40
PATIENT SCOTT Now she's calling me again. And it, I don't, I don't why it happened. She just . . . 

01:01:50
SCOTT MILLER Did you tell her to do it? 

01:01:50
PATIENT SCOTT No. 

01:01:50
SCOTT MILLER No. 

01:01:50
PATIENT SCOTT No. It's just the way it happened. 

01:01:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:01:50
PATIENT SCOTT You know, she'll call me now or leave a message on the machine. 

01:01:55
SCOTT MILLER That's nice. 

01:01:55
PATIENT SCOTT Just say absolutely nothing on the machine. 

01:02:00
SCOTT MILLER Does it make you smile? 

01:02:00
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes. 

01:02:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:02:00
PATIENT SCOTT There for a while, it was getting crazy. Everyday I'd get home and she'd talk for 10 minutes on the machine and say absolutely nothing. And I'm listening to this thing. And I'd call her up and say, well, what did you actually want? And, you know, it was no big deal. 

01:02:15
SCOTT MILLER All right. She just wanted to talk. 

01:02:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:02:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:02:20
PATIENT SCOTT She said, well, you ain't ever home so I just talk to the machine. 

01:02:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:02:20
PATIENT SCOTT When you get home, you call me. 

01:02:20
2-39 

01:02:25
SCOTT MILLER Seeing her, or having her call you, leave you messages, even though sometimes they say nothing . . . 

01:02:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:02:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . in the message, they say a lot to you. 

01:02:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:02:30
SCOTT MILLER Am I right about this? 

01:02:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. 

01:02:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:02:35
PATIENT SCOTT She's just calling to check up on me. 

01:02:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:02:35
PATIENT SCOTT Make sure I'm still kicking. 

01:02:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Anything else you'd see in her over the next six months on the way to Vegas that would make you feel more confident and less having to check less frequently about your back? 

01:02:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uhm . . . 

01:02:50
SCOTT MILLER Anything that comes to mind. Are you . . . 

01:02:55
PATIENT SCOTT It made me feel more confident there the other night she was telling me she told her mother the other night that I'd asked her to marry me--marry her. 

01:03:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:03:00
PATIENT SCOTT And I was really surprised that she'd told her. 

01:03:00
SCOTT MILLER Why's that? 

01:03:05
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't know, her mother--they talk but in--they don't, I don't, I don't think anyhow, they don't talk, you know, a lot about that . . . 

01:03:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:03:15
PATIENT SCOTT . . . kind of stuff. You know, they might talk about a bunch of bologna but to get down to the-- and sometimes--they might but I don't see them doing a lot of it. 

01:03:20
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:03:20
PATIENT SCOTT So. 

01:03:20
SCOTT MILLER So it obviously was something . . . 

01:03:25
2-40 

01:03:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. It was something that meant something to her. So, and it, you know, makes me feel good to know she's told, told her mother that, you know, that she's, she's ready. 

01:03:35
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:03:35
PATIENT SCOTT So I haven't told my mother yet. But . . . 

01:03:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:03:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . I was holding off until she told, you know, told me, you know, that everything was good with her. 

01:03:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Anything that would be happening in Nancy that would make you feel confident enough to tell your mother? That you would see in the next week or so? 

01:03:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uhm, well, I could, could tell my mother tonight. It wouldn't bother me a bit. 

01:03:55
SCOTT MILLER Really? Did something change that makes you feel like, oh now I can do it? 

01:04:00
PATIENT SCOTT Well, just things have been going like they should go. 

01:04:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:04:00
PATIENT SCOTT Or how I think they should go. 

01:04:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:04:05
PATIENT SCOTT We get along real good. And it's, you know, I don't have--when I call and ask her to come out to my place . . . 

01:04:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:04:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . instead of me coming up . . . 

01:04:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:04:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . it's no problem. I'll be there in, you know, 45 minutes or whatever. 

01:04:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:04:15
PATIENT SCOTT It's, ah, it's like we're thinking as one instead of, you know, I'm doing this tonight, you know, and I don't have the time to do that. 

01:04:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:04:25
2-41 

01:04:25
PATIENT SCOTT It's more that way now between us now than it ever was. 

01:04:30
SCOTT MILLER Wow. And if things continued like that . . . 

01:04:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:04:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . you'd feel very comfortable . . . 

01:04:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:04:35
SCOTT MILLER . . . flying out to Vegas? 

01:04:35
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:04:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. This wouldn't be a big gamble? 

01:04:35
PATIENT SCOTT No. No. When was it, two weeks ago, we went to the county fair in Kankakee (ph) and had one of my buddies on. He's a little bit on the crazy side. 

01:04:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:04:45
PATIENT SCOTT And he goes up to the band and pays them off to tell them, tell us congratulations over the PA. And this place is packed full of people and there ain't room to walk hardly and he's gotta go up there and do that. 

01:04:55
SCOTT MILLER What did Nancy think of that? 

01:05:00
PATIENT SCOTT She thought I did it. 

01:05:00
SCOTT MILLER Oh. 

01:05:00
PATIENT SCOTT I said, no I didn't have a thing to do with this. I didn't know nothing about it until the band had said it. I had not a clue. 

01:05:05
SCOTT MILLER So you were as shocked as her? 

01:05:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:05:10
SCOTT MILLER Did she like it? Sort of. 

01:05:10
PATIENT SCOTT She liked the part of, yeah that. But she was kind of embarrassed because that's where it happened. 

01:05:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:05:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. It was funny though. 

01:05:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:05:20
PATIENT SCOTT I got a big kick out of her on the way home cuz she harassed me about it on the way home. I said, I told you, I didn't have a thing to do with it. I didn't know it was coming or nothing. 

01:05:30
2-42 

01:05:30
SCOTT MILLER Well, sort of announcing to the world. 

01:05:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:05:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:05:35
PATIENT SCOTT My one uncle caught us on the--we were walking and he caught us. He said, ah, I heard on the announcement that, ah, was that you two? Nah, nah, I didn't hear a thing. 

01:05:45
SCOTT MILLER Well, Scott, I'd like to take a break here . . . 

01:05:45
PATIENT SCOTT Okay. 

01:05:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . for five or six minutes. 

01:05:45
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds good. 

01:05:50
SCOTT MILLER Think about what you've told me about. 

01:05:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:05:50
SCOTT MILLER As I said earlier, if, uhm, anything, you know, as you think about . . . 

01:05:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:05:55
SCOTT MILLER . . . our chat. 

01:05:55
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:05:55
SCOTT MILLER As brief as it's been. 

01:06:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:00
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, if anything, uhm, stands out as sort of like, yeah . . . 

01:06:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . that you want to think about or, ah, feel like you need to think a little bit more about, I think that's kind of the kind of guy you are anyway. 

01:06:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:10
SCOTT MILLER Or you feel like, I need to do more of that. 

01:06:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:15
SCOTT MILLER Share it with me when I come back. 

01:06:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Sounds good. 

01:06:15
SCOTT MILLER Good enough? 

01:06:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:06:15
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds good to me. 

01:06:15
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:06:15
PATIENT SCOTT I can handle that. 

01:06:20
SCOTT MILLER Good. Okay. Scott, welcome back. 

01:06:25
2-43 

01:06:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:06:25
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, I just wonder if you had any thoughts or reactions or . . . 

01:06:30
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I'm just . . . 

01:06:35
SCOTT MILLER Anything about what we talked about? 

01:06:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . kind of sitting here relaxing. 

01:06:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:06:35
PATIENT SCOTT Not doing anything crazy. 

01:06:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Good enough. Well, I just wanted to, ah, I did have some thoughts and if you have any response to these, let me know. 

01:06:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:06:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, uhm, I guess my first one is that, ah, I just want to let you know that I found this really enjoyable, 

01:06:55
PATIENT SCOTT Good. 

01:06:55
SCOTT MILLER Talking with you. 

01:06:55
PATIENT SCOTT I had a good time. 

01:06:55
SCOTT MILLER Good. Uhm, a can't remember a time, ah, with, ah, when I've had one of these visits where I've, ah, laughed as much . . . 

01:07:05
PATIENT SCOTT That's good. 

01:07:05
SCOTT MILLER . . . and smiled as much. Uhm, so I just want you to know that. 

01:07:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:05
2-44 

01:07:10
SCOTT MILLER And I, and I, uhm, not that there, not that there wasn't, uhm, not that I didn't notice that, that you've been though a lot at the same time. Uhm, but hey, no one says you have to frown and, ah . . . 

01:07:20
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:07:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . cry in your beer. 

01:07:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:20
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, I know that things have been hard . . . 

01:07:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . for the last, ah, few years, death of your family members . . . 

01:07:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . struggles with Nancy . . . 

01:07:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:07:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . uhm, and such. But overall, it seems like, as I thought back over the 40 minutes . . . 

01:07:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:35
SCOTT MILLER . . . we chatted or so, uhm, seems like your sense is that things are on the way. 

01:07:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:40
SCOTT MILLER Am I right about this? 

01:07:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:07:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:07:45
PATIENT SCOTT We've gotten a lot better. 

01:07:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And that, that you're thinking that's because--and my thinking actually is it's a combination of both some very thoughtful and careful decision-making on your part. Uhm, I just think that you're the kind of guy who takes time to make a decision. 

01:08:05
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, and that when, ah, people push, that sends up even more red flags. 

01:08:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:10
SCOTT MILLER Because somehow that doesn't fit with who you are . . . 

01:08:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . in making decisions slowly and carefully. Once you do make a decision, it seems like . . . 

01:08:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . you're very committed. 

01:08:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:20
2-45 

01:08:20
SCOTT MILLER Ah, you have an ethic about following through on the promises . . . 

01:08:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . that you've made. We need more of that in this world really. 

01:08:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. No doubt. 

01:08:30
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, so there's a combination of that, about who you are, the careful decision-making. And then in addition, it also seems like the thing that keeps you on track and, and feeling confident is that, ah, ah, you learn from your experience. You're observant and you watch. Uhm, and again, it seems like red flags go off when--and your past experience tells you that red flags should go off when you're being pushed . . . 

01:08:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . to make a decision or to go against what you, what you've learned . . . 

01:08:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:08:55
SCOTT MILLER . . . or before you've learned. It seems like in the relationship with Nancy, ah, what you have learned very much is to talk, talk early and talk often. 

01:09:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. It makes a big help, yeah. 

01:09:10
SCOTT MILLER And if that continues, then it seems like you're feeling confident. 

01:09:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:15
2-46 

01:09:15
SCOTT MILLER So my only sort of suggestion, uhm, is to simply, ah, pay attention, because of your--the observant person you are, is to pay attention to the signs that, ah, you can feel confident . . . 

01:09:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . over the next six months. So every time you notice something, I want you to keep your eyes open for signs that you can and should feel confident. 

01:09:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:40
SCOTT MILLER And notice those signs and then talk . . . 

01:09:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . about them with Nancy. 

01:09:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:40
SCOTT MILLER Share them with Nancy. 

01:09:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:45
SCOTT MILLER So the, you know, when she tells her mother, you know, you noticed it. 

01:09:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:50
SCOTT MILLER And then say . . . 

01:09:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:09:50
SCOTT MILLER That meant, that meant something to me. 

01:09:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:09:55
SCOTT MILLER That's my only, that's my only thought. 

01:09:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Well, I'm just thinking here, sometimes I get a little bit depressed. 

01:10:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:10:00
PATIENT SCOTT And I don't, I don't know, I'll be going along all of a sudden . . . 

01:10:00
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:00
PATIENT SCOTT And then I'll get depressed for a couple of days. I have no idea why I do that, but, and sometimes, you know, I'm just here and then there's some days I'll completely hit the bottom. 

01:10:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:15
PATIENT SCOTT I just don't even feel like doing diddly-squat. 

01:10:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:15
PATIENT SCOTT But most of the time, it don't last but a few days and then that's it. 

01:10:20
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:20
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea why. 

01:10:20
2-47 

01:10:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And so help me understand. What have you, what have you learned about that as a result of . . . 

01:10:30
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I try not to get there. 

01:10:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

01:10:30
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea why I even, why or what brings it on. 

01:10:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:10:35
PATIENT SCOTT It's just sometime, you know, I'm happy one day and the next day I just, I'm down in the dumps. 

01:10:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:40
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea why. 

01:10:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:10:45
PATIENT SCOTT It don't happen very often. 

01:10:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. It doesn't happen very often, but every once and a while . . . 

01:10:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:10:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . it does happen. 

01:10:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:10:50
SCOTT MILLER And then things sort . . . 

01:10:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:10:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . bottom out. 

01:10:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:10:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:10:55
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:10:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Well, I mean, again, my thought is that, ah, maybe--at least at this point, we don't have enough information to really understand what that is. 

01:11:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Right. 

01:11:05
SCOTT MILLER But you may want to notice what's happening when those periods take place. 

01:11:10
PATIENT SCOTT Be a little more observant again there. 

01:11:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah. 

01:11:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:11:10
SCOTT MILLER Does that make sense? 

01:11:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. What's causing it and then go from there to correct what's causing it. 

01:11:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:11:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:11:15
SCOTT MILLER Is it--does it make sense to you? 

01:11:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Uh-huh. 

01:11:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:11:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:11:20
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

01:11:20
PATIENT SCOTT It does. It helps. 

01:11:20
2-48 

01:11:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Good enough. Any other thoughts or feelings about anything? Does this--has this, ah . . . 

01:11:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, that helps. It just helps to talk. I mean . . . 

01:11:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:11:30
PATIENT SCOTT You know. 

01:11:30
SCOTT MILLER Talk early, talk often. 

01:11:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. And it, it definitely helps. 

01:11:35
SCOTT MILLER Good enough. 

01:11:35
PATIENT SCOTT It always helped a lot so far. 

01:11:35
PATIENT SCOTT Have you shared these moments of feeling down with Nancy? 

01:11:40
PATIENT SCOTT Well, like I say, sometimes I'm one of those kind of people, sometimes it hard for me to . . . 

01:11:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:11:45
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to talk. I just, I pull off in a corner somewhere . . . 

01:11:50
SCOTT MILLER All right. 

01:11:50
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and then I'm just, you know, leave me alone. 

01:11:50
SCOTT MILLER If, if, if you were able to talk with her, would, would you feel more confident? 

01:11:55
PATIENT SCOTT It probably would help. 

01:11:55
SCOTT MILLER Would you feel more confident about the relationship? 

01:11:55
SCOTT MILLER Probably. 

01:12:00
SCOTT MILLER Really? 

01:12:00
PATIENT SCOTT It probably would help me out. You know, I can talk to her about a lot of stuff. 

01:12:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:12:00
PATIENT SCOTT But, and like I said, there's some stuff you just--it's hard to talk to a woman about no matter . . . 

01:12:05
SCOTT MILLER Sure. 

01:12:05
PATIENT SCOTT . . . if it's, you know, your wife or your mother. 

01:12:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah. 

01:12:10
PATIENT SCOTT Or it's just hard to talk about. 

01:12:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:12:10
PATIENT SCOTT That's when I call Uncle Jerry and talk to him. 

01:12:15
SCOTT MILLER All right. Perfect. 

01:12:15
PATIENT SCOTT I go to talk. 

01:12:15
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. 

01:12:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:12:15
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. You sort of rally these other resources. 

01:12:20
2-49 

01:12:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. That's where--like when I had the counselor before, she said if you've got to talk to somebody in the night, whatever, just call. 

01:12:25
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. 

01:12:25
PATIENT SCOTT You know, I ain't going to guarantee that I'll be there, but if you need somebody, just give me a jingle. 

01:12:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:12:30
PATIENT SCOTT And that, you know, that helps just knowing you got somebody there to talk to. 

01:12:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:12:35
PATIENT SCOTT You know, it ain't really nobody, you know, that I know but just somebody to talk to. 

01:12:40
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. That person now is Jerry . . . 

01:12:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:12:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . or your-- would you like to be able to talk to somebody else? 

01:12:45
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes it's, it's good to talk to somebody else. 

01:12:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:12:50
PATIENT SCOTT And it kind of puts a fresh perspective of, you know, and getting more ide-, something--four eyes are better than two. 

01:12:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:12:55
PATIENT SCOTT You know, maybe, they'll pick up something that, oh hey, they didn't even see before. You know, and it's right there and it bites you. 

01:13:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:13:05
PATIENT SCOTT And just sometime to just have somebody to tell you what it was. 

01:13:05
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:13:05
PATIENT SCOTT And, and you're completely overlooking it and there it was. 

01:13:10
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. If there was some way that we could arrange to either meet or to continue our conversations, would that be something you'd be . . . 

01:13:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:13:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . interested in. 

01:13:20
PATIENT SCOTT I could handle that. 

01:13:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:13:20
PATIENT SCOTT Because it helps just to, you know, it helped that to take it off the, off the chest a little bit. 

01:13:25
2-50 

01:13:25
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. 

01:13:25
PATIENT SCOTT Even if you just, you know, not even really talk about anything serious, just to talk. It, it helps to, to keep moving. 

01:13:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:13:35
PATIENT SCOTT Keep looking in the right direction anyhow. 

01:13:35
SCOTT MILLER Let's figure out how to make that happen. 

01:13:35
SCOTT MILLER Sounds good. All right. 

01:13:40
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds real good. Thank you, sir. 

01:13:40
SCOTT MILLER Thanks a lot Scott. 

01:13:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:13:45
[sil.] 

01:13:45
3-1 

01:13:50
JON CARLSON Let's begin, ah, this section of our program by watching a clip that came early in the interview in which you show us listening, acknowledging and validating with Scott. 

01:14:05
SCOTT MILLER Good. Perfect. 

01:14:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, hmm, tell me just a little bit about, ah, yourself and what you were hoping for from tonight. Ah, any thoughts you'd had about that. 

01:14:15
PATIENT SCOTT Well, everybody always tells me, I'm a little bit, ah, scared to make commitments. 

01:14:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:14:20
PATIENT SCOTT And they always said that I would just say, I don't always want to make a decision right away. 

01:14:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:14:30
PATIENT SCOTT Always kind of hem-haw around about it. 

01:14:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:14:35
PATIENT SCOTT And that, I don't know, that's probably true. 

01:14:35
3-2 

01:14:35
SCOTT MILLER It is? 

01:14:35
PATIENT SCOTT But I don't know if it's just me or if it's just I'm a big chicken to do it. 

01:14:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So it, you, you would . . . 

01:14:45
JON CARLSON Scott, just what was happening there? What were you hoping to do at this part of the interview? 

01:14:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay, for me, listening, acknowledging are activities that can only be judged from the client's perspective. When I'm listening, I'm hoping that the client feels like I'm attending to them. So I'm doing everything that I know, everything that I've learned to communicate that I'm trying to attend to the story they are telling. Acknowledging for me is letting the client know or hopefully having the client experience me as understanding the story that they're telling. 

01:15:15
JON CARLSON Okay. Well, let's let this clip just continue. 

01:15:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:15:15
JON CARLSON And watch how you refrain and you really highlight Scott's strengths. 

01:15:25
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:15:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So it, you, you would say that the, these people who make these . . . 

01:15:30
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:15:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . comments, that their view may be accurate? 

01:15:30
PATIENT SCOTT Could be, yeah. 

01:15:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay, could be. 

01:15:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it, yeah, cuz it, it ain't just one person telling me . . . 

01:15:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:15:35
3-3 

01:15:35
PATIENT SCOTT . . . it's, you know, there have been several people tell me. So I kind of said, well, you know, if one person said well, you know, I'd think about it. But when more than that, you know, something is gotta be going on. 

01:15:45
SCOTT MILLER All right. So you've heard this stuff . . . 

01:15:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:15:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . before. 

01:15:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:15:45
SCOTT MILLER And you start thinking, well, you know . . . 

01:15:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:15:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:15:50
PATIENT SCOTT And they go, just make up your mind and do it, you know. 

01:15:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:15:55
PATIENT SCOTT Either you're not or you are, one of the two. 

01:15:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:15:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I hear that at work too once and a while. 

01:15:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:15:55
PATIENT SCOTT And it, it's, it's very true. 

01:16:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so it takes you some time to make a decision. 

01:16:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:16:00
SCOTT MILLER Do you eventually make the decision? 

01:16:05
PATIENT SCOTT Usually, yeah. 

01:16:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:16:05
PATIENT SCOTT I did--I try to weigh out the situation, which is the best way. 

01:16:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:16:10
PATIENT SCOTT It may not always be right but . . . 

01:16:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:16:10
PATIENT SCOTT It, it makes it tough sometimes. 

01:16:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so you're the kind of guy who carefully weighs a decision, considers the options . . . 

01:16:20
PATIENT SCOTT Tries to . . . 

01:16:20
JON CARLSON Boy, you really are positive. You just seem to really want to build out and build on his strengths. 

01:16:25
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:16:25
JON CARLSON Is that a big part of your approach? 

01:16:30
SCOTT MILLER I think that all therapists validate certain parts of the conversation and selectively ignore other things. Usually, what we pay attention to as therapists depends on the kind of theory that we come from. 

01:16:40
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:16:40
3-4 

01:16:40
SCOTT MILLER For me, at least, what's important in the story that he tells is that, ah, he does eventually resolve these things and he's also a guy who carefully weighs things. These are two strengths. My sense is that's where the power of change take place, from a position of strength. 

01:16:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:16:55
DIANE KJOS Now you could have said, so you're a guy that really has trouble with making decisions. 

01:17:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. That would privilege other people's view of him. 

01:17:00
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:17:00
SCOTT MILLER Ah, for me, at least, it's the client's strengths and resources and particularly their view of their strengths and resources that I'm going to privilege or validate. 

01:17:10
DIANE KJOS But, but that's what he came with was I'm having trouble making decisions. 

01:17:10
SCOTT MILLER Well, he came actually with both. That's what I think is important to note. 

01:17:15
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:17:15
Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. 

01:17:15
SCOTT MILLER He tells a very broad story. Because of our training, especially as therapists, we're problem solvers traditionally. 

01:17:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:17:20
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

01:17:20
SCOTT MILLER That's what we've validated or paid attention to in the conversation. But he tells a very broad story here. You can choose what you want to pay attention to. Why not highlight this instead. 

01:17:30
DIANE KJOS Hmm. Hmm. 

01:17:30
3-4 

01:17:35
JON CARLSON Doesn't that put him in some kind of dissonance though? Some kind of an uncomfortable state, ah, as he sees himself as a problem with decision-making and you see him as dec-, decision maker. 

01:17:50
3-5 

01:17:50
SCOTT MILLER Well, again, if I'm hearing him correctly, what he said was that other people view him this way. When I stated it back that perhaps that what they say is true, he said, could be. 

01:18:00
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

01:18:05
SCOTT MILLER I'm not so sure that he's dissonant with my comments. In fact, I think they might fit for him. He actually sees himself as somebody who, uhm, takes his time and weighs decisions carefully and that's what good for him. 

01:18:15
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

01:18:15
JON CARLSON Well, let's watch another clip where there's some more selective attending on your part. 

01:18:20
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:18:20
3-6 

01:18:20
SCOTT MILLER All right. So Nancy, who's Nancy? 

01:18:20
PATIENT SCOTT Oh, that's my girlfriend. 

01:18:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And is she one of these, uhm, voices . . . 

01:18:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:18:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . that say, you know . . . 

01:18:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:18:25
SCOTT MILLER . . . come on, Scott . . . 

01:18:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:18:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:18:30
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. And what, I've knowed her for five, five and half years, something like that. 

01:18:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:18:35
PATIENT SCOTT So it's . . . 

01:18:35
SCOTT MILLER Have you been kind of boyfriend girlfriend. 

01:18:40
PATIENT SCOTT Darn near the whole time. 

01:18:40
SCOTT MILLER Oh wow. 

01:18:40
PATIENT SCOTT She moved in next door to where I lived and that's how I met her. 

01:18:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:18:45
PATIENT SCOTT And then, just ever since then, we've been going out or we lived together for four years so . . . 

01:18:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So you're together living in the same house now for . . . 

01:18:50
PATIENT SCOTT Not right now, we're not. 

01:18:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Okay. 

01:18:55
PATIENT SCOTT But we're working on it so . . . 

01:18:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

01:18:55
PATIENT SCOTT But things are going real good so far. 

01:18:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay, so things are actually going well with, with Nancy? 

01:19:00
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:19:00
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Tell me more about that. 

01:19:00
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

01:19:00
3-7 

01:19:05
JON CARLSON How come you didn't develop this apparent problem some more that he has with Nancy, the fact that they moved, ah, together and then they moved apart and, and he says things are going good but then he says so far. 

01:19:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:19:15
DIANE KJOS And he's working on it. 

01:19:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:19:20
SCOTT MILLER The question is how come I paid attention to that? 

01:19:20
JON CARLSON How come you didn't really develop that. I mean that's a--to a therapist that's a gold mine. That's a problem. That's--you're supposed to dig, dig, dig. 

01:19:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. I guess my question would be is why would you listen to that? That, that the question . . . 

01:19:30
JON CARLSON That's the problem. 

01:19:30
SCOTT MILLER That the, the question you asked privileges once again the therapist's view and the therapist's activity and what I heard, in addition, in this very rich story, was that, ah, he'd actually been working on this already, that he'd taken active steps and that they were working on get back together. So, so my, my, my, my question is serious, why would we focus on that as a profession. For me, the client's strengths, resources and abilities are where change is at. 

01:20:00
Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D., ABPP 

01:20:00
JON CARLSON Hmm. I think from therapy lenses, we see that as a red flag when he says so far. 

01:20:05
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:20:05
JON CARLSON Ah, working on it. Ah . . . 

01:20:10
3-8 

01:20:10
DIANE KJOS And, and I'm wondering if that's why he's, why he's here, you know. That he's having trouble in his relationship. 

01:20:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:20:15
DIANE KJOS And, and some concerns about it. 

01:20:20
SCOTT MILLER What I would like him to be here for is that he is busy actively solving this problem. So I'm not exactly sure there's some real reason why he's here. 

01:20:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:20:30
SCOTT MILLER Therapists in interaction with clients create those reasons. What I am going to create with him is a picture of himself as on the move, making changes and accessing his skills and resources. 

01:20:40
JON CARLSON Well, let's see what happens next then . . . 

01:20:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON . . . and see. 

01:20:45
PATIENT SCOTT And she had problems with her girl-, with her girlfriend where she lived. 

01:20:45
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:20:50
PATIENT SCOTT And they got in a fight one night and moved her out in about two hours. 

01:20:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:20:50
PATIENT SCOTT And I pulled all the strings. I had her furniture at my grandmother's, at my house and my father's house. 

01:20:55
SCOTT MILLER Wow. 

01:20:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I moved her at my father's house so . . . 

01:21:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:21:00
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and it just kind of progressed from there. And we got a place together. We lived together for quite a while. 

01:21:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:21:05
PATIENT SCOTT And last summer, we had some problems . . . 

01:21:10
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:21:10
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and she decided she was going to move out. 

01:21:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:21:10
PATIENT SCOTT Which . . . 

01:21:15
SCOTT MILLER Now is that the summer before this current summer? 

01:21:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, last fall. 

01:21:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:21:15
3-9 

01:21:15
PATIENT SCOTT About a year ago. 

01:21:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay, okay. 

01:21:15
PATIENT SCOTT And, you know, we had some problems that we've worked on it a bunch. Cuz I had, like I say, I've had problems with my temper. 

01:21:20
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:21:20
PATIENT SCOTT And I've worked on it. And it, it's had its good and bad. 

01:21:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:21:30
PATIENT SCOTT And right now, things are a whole lot better than what they were a year ago. 

01:21:35
SCOTT MILLER With Nancy and with your temper. 

01:21:35
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:21:35
SCOTT MILLER How has that happened? 

01:21:35
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

01:21:35
JON CARLSON It seems like in this clip you're really helping him understand how he finds a solution. 

01:21:45
SCOTT MILLER Not exactly. Uhm, my idea here is that I'm validating something. In particular, his efforts vis-a-vis the problems that he experiences in this relationship. So I'd like him to leave my interview with him with a sense of efficacy in his problem-solving efforts. Not necessarily a method that he's going to use. If he leaves at the end saying, I think I can solve this, I'm capable of doing that, then I will have felt successful. 

01:22:10
DIANE KJOS Now if you're empathic, you would have picked up on the, that must have been a really tough time for you. 

01:22:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:22:15
DIANE KJOS Or, you know. 

01:22:15
3-10 

01:22:15
SCOTT MILLER Only if we define empathy as listening to negative statements. But it seems to me that, ah, we have a tendency in this field to define empathy only in terms of pain and suffering. Why not joy, happiness, success and possibilities. 

01:22:30
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. 

01:22:30
JON CARLSON Hmm. Well, in this next clip, we're going to watch you summarize and then continue to acknowledge, ah, the client's-- his abilities. 

01:22:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Yeah. 

01:22:40
SCOTT MILLER Making sure that things are okay and that you're still safe and that . . . 

01:22:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:22:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:22:45
PATIENT SCOTT Like a sixth sense almost. 

01:22:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:22:45
PATIENT SCOTT You got, you can feel that something ain't quite right. 

01:22:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:22:50
PATIENT SCOTT Like when I'm in the hole, most of the time, I can feel the ground move before you can see it move. 

01:22:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:22:55
PATIENT SCOTT Just som-, you can feel it. How, I don't know. 

01:22:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:22:55
PATIENT SCOTT But you feel it. 

01:23:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:23:00
PATIENT SCOTT It's just something you look at--you feel. 

01:23:00
SCOTT MILLER Right. Right. I was just struck by all these things that, I mean, you've had going on. You had the, the, uhm, the difficulties with Nancy that you guys went through. 

01:23:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:23:10
SCOTT MILLER You had, ah, the deaths of . . . 

01:23:10
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:23:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . these close family members. 

01:23:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:23:15
3-11 

01:23:15
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, you had this anger that you were sort of working on and struggling with. 

01:23:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:23:20
SCOTT MILLER And you're saying that those things are kind of on a roll. 

01:23:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:23:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:23:25
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm not a go-, a person most of the time to go out and just go start talking and I hold a lot of it inside and then I just keep burning and burning in there. 

01:23:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:23:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it comes to a head sometimes. 

01:23:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:23:35
PATIENT SCOTT But it, you know, I learned it helps and I, lot of times I just go out to the shop . . . 

01:23:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:23:35
PATIENT SCOTT And I'll work on a car or whatever just to get away from everybody for an hour or two. 

01:23:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. So when you have that feeling of things kind of burning inside . . . 

01:23:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:23:45
SCOTT MILLER . . . one way you take care of it is by . . . 

01:23:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:23:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . getting off to yourself. That helps you I guess to keep from what? 

01:23:50
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. It keeps my temper under control. 

01:23:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:23:55
PATIENT SCOTT And . . . 

01:23:55
SCOTT MILLER Where'd you learn this? 

01:23:55
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't know. It was something that Nancy or somebody was telling me. She always told--one or her girlfriends read it in a book, you should--one of them should always walk away. 

01:24:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:24:05
PATIENT SCOTT Well, that didn't always work because, I'd say well, I walked away the last three times we've had a discussion. Well, it's your turn to walk away. 

01:24:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:24:15
PATIENT SCOTT Or she'd follow me right out to the garage. 

01:24:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:24:15
3-12 

01:24:15
PATIENT SCOTT You know. But I, I'd do it at work if, you know, if things were going bad or whatever, I'd just go to the water cooler and get a drink. 

01:24:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:24:25
PATIENT SCOTT And just stay away from everybody for a couple of minutes, come back and we'll hit her hard again. 

01:24:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:24:30
PATIENT SCOTT You know, we'll--boss and me will discuss it, what, you know, we need to do . . . 

01:24:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:24:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . and we'll go from there. That way nobody gets hurt and it's the safest way to do it. 

01:24:35
SCOTT MILLER So there's a combination of things that I'm catching here . . . 

01:24:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:24:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . that, that you, you not only sometimes take a break and say I got to . . . 

01:24:40
JON CARLSON What was going on here Scott? First, you began by summarizing. 

01:24:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:24:45
JON CARLSON What, what was, what was happening in this summarizing part for you? 

01:24:50
SCOTT MILLER This is something I typically do when I'm feeling a bit stuck. I go back to the last point of focus in the interview and highlight what I've understood him to say and check that out with him and when I do this, very often the client continues. 

01:25:05
JON CARLSON Ah, so when you're stuck and confused is when summary is useful. 

01:25:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yes. 

01:25:10
JON CARLSON Hmm. And that happened in the rest of this piece for you? What else did you notice? 

01:25:15
3-13 

01:25:15
SCOTT MILLER Well, again, he tells a very rich story, ah, that has a combination of strengths and resources and deficits and problems and I highlight his strengths and resources in terms of how he solves this particular problem. 

01:25:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. He seems to want to give a lot of power to other people. 

01:25:35
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. And I think about that and I know that in the next, ah, minutes in the session, I'll probably be doing things that help him own that power, ah, own the things he does to cause those changes to take place in his life. 

01:25:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. I mean, so that it isn't such, ah, externally controlled? 

01:25:50
SCOTT MILLER Right. In fact, I think there's pretty good evidence in the research literature that clients who externalize the source of change are less likely to make--, maintain those changes over time. 

01:26:00
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

01:26:00
SCOTT MILLER So I'd like help them own some of those changes. I don't think it's terrible that this particular guy externalizes some of it, but I also want him to see himself as the center of the change universe. 

01:26:10
JON CARLSON So, so this really calculated, what you're doing here. It's based upon ah, ah, research? 

01:26:15
3-14 

01:26:15
SCOTT MILLER Ah, I think what I try to do in my therapy is outcome informed. I try to reflect what the research says works. So the answer to that question is yes. But I think all therapists hear certain things in the conversation and selectively ignore others. 

01:26:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. But you're saying you do that based upon data, on research, rather than maybe, uhm . . . 

01:26:35
SCOTT MILLER I try. 

01:26:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:26:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:26:40
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. 

01:26:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. Well, in this next clip we've going to watch, ah, you ask him to talk about, ah, now what's gotten better. 

01:26:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:26:45
JON CARLSON And let's see that. 

01:26:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:26:50
SCOTT MILLER . . . wrong about this, but it seems like you sort of have this clear vision about where you want things to go. 

01:26:55
PATIENT SCOTT Not always. 

01:26:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:26:55
PATIENT SCOTT And I--I don't now, in the last six months, it's gotten better. 

01:27:00
SCOTT MILLER It has. 

01:27:00
PATIENT SCOTT But, I don't know, I'm--I never usually plan too far ahead. 

01:27:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:27:00
PATIENT SCOTT I know in the spring and in the fall I'm in the field farming. 

01:27:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:27:05
PATIENT SCOTT And then, you know, the rest of it, I, I kind of fly by as when it gets done, it gets done. 

01:27:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. What's gotten better about the situation in the last six months in terms of this part? 

01:27:15
PATIENT SCOTT Well, communication wise. 

01:27:15
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:27:15
3-15 

01:27:15
PATIENT SCOTT It's just gotten a lot better because we can, seems like, I don't know, I'd say we've both growed up a little bit and we've learned now, we've got to talk to each other . . . 

01:27:25
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:27:25
PATIENT SCOTT . . . to make it work. 

01:27:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:27:30
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz she's 30--39 years old. 

01:27:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:27:30
PATIENT SCOTT Or 38. 

01:27:30
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:27:30
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm only 30. 

01:27:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:27:35
PATIENT SCOTT So it, there's a little bit of an age difference. You know, and, like I said, she's been married twice, so, you know, she's a little bit further along in what, you know, it takes to make a relationship work. 

01:27:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:27:45
PATIENT SCOTT And I'm still trying to learn this stuff. 

01:27:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay, you're catching up. 

01:27:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh, I'm trying to catch up here. 

01:27:50
JON CARLSON This seems to be a good example of just how inadequate this man feels. He's younger, he's had less experience, ah, is that the way you see it? 

01:28:00
SCOTT MILLER No. In fact, I, I, the, when I watch this clip, I think, ah, how wonderful this guy is. Ah, what a delightful person he is. And you can only see him as inadequate if you listen to a very selective part of what he just said in the previous comments. 

01:28:15
JON CARLSON Maybe you need to wear my glasses here and we can, ah . . . 

01:28:15
3-16 

01:28:20
SCOTT MILLER I've spent most of my career taking off the lenses that my professional training gave me. I think we've marginalized and stereotyped clients to fit into our theories of pathology. Those theories glorify the therapist role. This guy is tremendous. 

01:28:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:28:35
DIANE KJOS He has a lot of resources that he's, that he's pulling together as you say. 

01:28:40
SCOTT MILLER Sure. I want to communicate that I understand that he's troubled by this. I want to acknowledge that. At the same time, I want to hear both sides of the story. 

01:28:45
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:28:50
JON CARLSON Well, in this next clip, ah, we're going to see, you asked him about how, really how Nancy saw him and what Nancy liked about him. 

01:28:55
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:28:55
JON CARLSON Were you surprised by this, you know, stunned look that he had? That he couldn't' think of what Nancy might like about him? 

01:29:05
SCOTT MILLER No, actually not because this guy's whole style is to please other people and to be kind to other people, and to be observant of their needs and desires. So I wasn't surprised at all. 

01:29:20
JON CARLSON Hmm. Well, some people might call that a pathology, wouldn't they? 

01:29:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:29:20
JON CARLSON They would call . . . 

01:29:20
3-17 

01:29:20
SCOTT MILLER I'm surprised you didn't bring it up. Uhm, maybe call him co-dependent. 

01:29:25
JON CARLSON Oh, at best. 

01:29:25
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:29:30
JON CARLSON At best. 

01:29:30
SCOTT MILLER I'm sure we could make up other more pathological stories about him. Uhm, but that seems to me to be a very skewed picture of this guy. Maybe we need more dependent--co-dependent people in our culture. 

01:29:40
JON CARLSON Because . . . 

01:29:40
SCOTT MILLER Well, I think we're awfully selfish. 

01:29:40
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:29:45
SCOTT MILLER This is a guy who's giving, why not encourage that. 

01:29:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Well, let's watch this piece. 

01:29:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT And sometimes it don't. 

01:29:50
SCOTT MILLER And sometimes it doesn't. 

01:29:50
PATIENT SCOTT It causes a few waves but we try to learn from it. 

01:29:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:29:55
PATIENT SCOTT And say well, okay, this didn't work, why didn't it? 

01:29:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:29:55
PATIENT SCOTT You know. And sometimes, you know, I push too hard or she did. 

01:30:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:00
PATIENT SCOTT Or just, you know, something like that. 

01:30:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:00
PATIENT SCOTT Just something minor usually is what causes the biggest problems for us. 

01:30:05
SCOTT MILLER Is that what gives you the hope that things will . . . 

01:30:10
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, cuz I know we can work things out. 

01:30:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. What, what is it about you and her that makes you think that in addition to these changes, what, what gives you the hope about that? 

01:30:15
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

01:30:20
SCOTT MILLER I mean, I can really feel it as I listen to you talk. 

01:30:20
PATIENT SCOTT We like a lot of the same things. 

01:30:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:30:20
PATIENT SCOTT And she likes to go fishing. 

01:30:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:25
PATIENT SCOTT She likes to be outside. 

01:30:25
3-18 

01:30:25
SCOTT MILLER Unless it's raining. 

01:30:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, unless it's raining. You got it. She don't like to fish them 14, 15 hour days either. 

01:30:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:30:30
PATIENT SCOTT And a lot of people don't. 

01:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:35
PATIENT SCOTT So, and she likes the horses. 

01:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:35
PATIENT SCOTT Cuz I used to team rope. 

01:30:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:35
PATIENT SCOTT So--and she likes that part of it. 

01:30:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:30:40
PATIENT SCOTT And she basically likes to be out there in the country where I'm at. 

01:30:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:30:40
PATIENT SCOTT And that's ideally where I like to be. 

01:30:45
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:30:45
PATIENT SCOTT I don't like it up where there's a lot of people and she don't either. So we've got a lot of things that, you know, we like the same. 

01:30:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:30:50
PATIENT SCOTT And she don't mind my big fish tank or nothing like that. 

01:30:55
SCOTT MILLER You got a big fish tank? 

01:30:55
PATIENT SCOTT A hundred thirty-five gallon. 

01:30:55
SCOTT MILLER Wow. Salt water or fresh? 

01:31:00
PATIENT SCOTT Salt. 

01:31:00
SCOTT MILLER Salt. 

01:31:00
PATIENT SCOTT So, and I like to tinker with that kind of stuff so it, you know, it gets kind of expensive but she likes it too so . . . 

01:31:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:31:05
PATIENT SCOTT It gives us both, both something to, to deal with in the wintertime and . . . 

01:31:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:31:10
PATIENT SCOTT It's nice. 

01:31:10
SCOTT MILLER What would you say she likes about you? 

01:31:10
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea. I don't know. I have to really . . . 

01:31:15
SCOTT MILLER If I sort of had her off in a private moment and I say, now look at the guy over there. 

01:31:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:31:20
SCOTT MILLER You know, what is it about him? 

01:31:20
PATIENT SCOTT She'd probably say she likes that I, I help everybody out. You know, she likes part of it that I help everybody . . . 

01:31:25
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:31:25
3-19 

01:31:25
PATIENT SCOTT . . . but she don't like because a lot of times, I won't get the stuff done for her. 

01:31:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:31:30
PATIENT SCOTT You know. That way and, like I say, she's starting to learn that, and I won't, don't let nothing happen to her. 

01:31:35
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:31:35
PATIENT SCOTT I go out--try to go out of my way to help out anybody I can. 

01:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:31:40
PATIENT SCOTT Even, you know, if her mother needs something. 

01:31:40
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:31:40
PATIENT SCOTT I go over there and help her out all I can. 

01:31:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:31:45
PATIENT SCOTT And she likes that. 

01:31:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. She can see you have a really good spirit and all. 

01:31:45
PATIENT SCOTT Right. Uh-huh. 

01:31:50
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:31:50
PATIENT SCOTT She calls me up, I go over her house and I work, you know, I work more there than I do at my own house most of the time. 

01:31:55
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And you're also kind of generous it sounds like. 

01:32:00
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes. 

01:32:00
SCOTT MILLER With your time and . . . 

01:32:00
PATIENT SCOTT Like I said . . . 

01:32:00
JON CARLSON In this section, he shows what a pleaser he is, how he works really hard to please other people, and you're sort of like Pollyanna, you again, follow this through and find the good in what he's doing. 

01:32:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. Hmm. 

01:32:15
JON CARLSON Don't you think it's important that, ah, you talk about how this, ah, pleasing attitude, ah, wanting to please other people really contributes to his low self-esteem? 

01:32:25
3-20 

01:32:25
Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. 

01:32:30
SCOTT MILLER Well, I, I really wonder if he has a low self-esteem. You know, I've heard they've done autopsies on people, they've never found one of those yet inside any of them. I think that's an interesting concept that we've, we've, ah, made up. The, the question I think is important but for a different reason. The assumption in your question is that the locus of responsibility is in the therapist to bring this up. 

01:32:50
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:32:50
SCOTT MILLER But my sense is that to give him some time and some opportunity, if this is the thing that bothers him and concerns him, he will talk about it. I just have to open that conversational space and let's see where he goes with it. 

01:33:00
JON CARLSON So this is this democratic kind of a Rogerian model of if you create the context, people can find their own best way? 

01:33:10
SCOTT MILLER Well, I don't know that I have, uhm, the notion in my head that clients will always find the best way, but I do believe that people are problem-solving machines and they will always be making efforts to, ah, make changes in their lives in the areas that they deem important. 

01:33:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:33:25
3-21 

01:33:30
SCOTT MILLER So I think if we give them enough time and space, he may bring this up and express his own concern, and I promise you when he does, he'll also talk about how he's already solving it. 

01:33:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah, he, he, he does that anyway. 

01:33:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yeah. 

01:33:40
DIANE KJOS He's a great solver. 

01:33:45
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

01:33:45
JON CARLSON You know. 

01:33:45
SCOTT MILLER And he's, he's--I think he likes to see himself that way. 

01:33:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:33:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:33:45
SCOTT MILLER Perfect. 

01:33:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Uh-huh. 

01:33:50
JON CARLSON I can't picture you seeing him as a machine but that's a . . . 

01:33:50
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, unfortunate metaphor. 

01:33:50
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:33:55
SCOTT MILLER The species I think because we're always in motion. We're always moving. We're always adapting to the context around us. I think that's why we've survived and thrived as a species. We seem highly adaptable. 

01:34:05
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:34:05
SCOTT MILLER That's what this guy is. 

01:34:05
DIANE KJOS Well, and he likes to see himself as somebody who gives and takes care of and helps other people. 

01:34:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:34:10
DIANE KJOS I think that's important for him. 

01:34:10
SCOTT MILLER Right. I'm not going to change that. I certainly don't want to problematize for him. I don't want him to leave my session, ah, feeling like he's not only able to, ah, not only unable to commit but he also has a problem--needs to feel guilty about his particular style of being in the world. 

01:34:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:34:25
SCOTT MILLER I don't want that to happen. 

01:34:25
3-22 

01:34:25
JON CARLSON Well, let's jump ahead and watch a piece where you confirm the story. 

01:34:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:34:30
PATIENT SCOTT . . . me. 

01:34:30
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:34:30
PATIENT SCOTT And it helps her. 

01:34:30
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And what else, you know, what, uhm, what, anything else that, uhm, ah, makes you feel confident about the next three or four months that things will continue or, uhm . . . 

01:34:45
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't know how . . . 

01:34:45
SCOTT MILLER Will there be signs that were continuing, you know, small signs that you were . . . 

01:34:50
PATIENT SCOTT Well, like she was always saying that I was, you know, I was kind of afraid of commit to her. 

01:34:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:34:55
PATIENT SCOTT Well, since I've asked her to marry me . . . 

01:34:55
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:34:55
PATIENT SCOTT . . . things have really, you know, they've--we've progressed and we've went kind of to the next level. 

01:35:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:35:00
PATIENT SCOTT And things are going real good. I mean, they're smooth. 

01:35:05
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. And you--how do you feel about that decision? I mean, I mean . . . 

01:35:05
PATIENT SCOTT Well, it . . . 

01:35:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . where--what happened to all this, ah, fear of commitment and indecision and . . . 

01:35:10
PATIENT SCOTT Well . . . 

01:35:10
SCOTT MILLER I mean, did you just finally weigh it carefully enough that it made sense to you? 

01:35:15
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, I think so. And all the thinking about it . . . 

01:35:20
JON CARLSON Well, you sure are able to focus on his confidence. 

01:35:20
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:35:20
JON CARLSON What was this like for you? 

01:35:20
3-23 

01:35:25
SCOTT MILLER Fabulous. Uhm, and it, and it pretty much confirms the earlier comments that I was making at the, at the outset of, of this that if you only privilege him as the container for a problem that needs to be solved, you miss all this richness. He's on the way. He's made change. He's working out this commitment problem and using his own strengths and resources. I think it's, uhm, he, he really is marvelous. 

01:35:50
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Well, in this next clip, you're going to ask him to talk about signs . . . 

01:35:55
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:35:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:35:55
JON CARLSON . . . in the next six months. 

01:35:55
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:35:55
JON CARLSON Let's see that. 

01:35:55
DIANE KJOS I don't know, forward. 

01:36:00
SCOTT MILLER Movement. 

01:36:00
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. 

01:36:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:36:00
SCOTT MILLER Signs in Nancy that will tell you that you can check your back side a little less? 

01:36:05
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah, usually, yeah. 

01:36:05
SCOTT MILLER What? What kinds of signs will you be noticing in the next six months that you can sort of feel comfortable with your decision? 

01:36:10
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I don't--she always call me now. 

01:36:15
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:36:15
PATIENT SCOTT You know, and wonders, you know, you know, did I get home all right or, uhm . . . 

01:36:20
SCOTT MILLER What started that happening? I mean, because you were mostly calling her, mostly coming over. 

01:36:25
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:36:25
SCOTT MILLER Mostly cooking her meals, suddenly she's calling you. 

01:36:25
3-24 

01:36:30
PATIENT SCOTT Now she's calling me again. And it, I don't, I don't why it happened. She just . . . 

01:36:35
SCOTT MILLER Did you tell her to do it? 

01:36:35
PATIENT SCOTT No. 

01:36:35
SCOTT MILLER No. 

01:36:35
PATIENT SCOTT No. It's just the way it happened. 

01:36:35
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:36:40
PATIENT SCOTT You know, she'll call me now or leave a message on the machine. 

01:36:40
SCOTT MILLER That's nice. 

01:36:40
PATIENT SCOTT Just say absolutely nothing on the machine. 

01:36:45
SCOTT MILLER Does it make you smile? 

01:36:45
PATIENT SCOTT Sometimes. 

01:36:45
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:36:45
PATIENT SCOTT There for a while, it was getting crazy. Everyday I'd get home and she'd talk for 10 minutes on the machine and say absolutely nothing. And I'm listening to this thing. And I'd call her up and say, well, what did you actually want? And, you know, it was no big deal. 

01:37:00
SCOTT MILLER All right. She just wanted to talk. 

01:37:00
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. 

01:37:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:37:05
PATIENT SCOTT She said, well, you ain't ever home so I just talk to the machine. 

01:37:05
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:37:05
PATIENT SCOTT When you get home, you call me. 

01:37:10
SCOTT MILLER Seeing her, or having her call you, leave you messages, even though sometimes they say nothing . . . 

01:37:15
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:37:15
SCOTT MILLER . . . in the message, they say a lot to you. 

01:37:15
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:37:15
SCOTT MILLER Am I right about this? 

01:37:20
PATIENT SCOTT Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. 

01:37:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:37:20
PATIENT SCOTT She's just calling to check up on me. 

01:37:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:37:20
PATIENT SCOTT Make sure I'm still kicking. 

01:37:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Anything else you'd see in her over the next six months on the way to Vegas that would make you feel more confident . . . 

01:37:30
3-24 

01:37:30
JON CARLSON Have you ever had training as a professional sales person? I mean, it seems like you're just really trying to sell him . . . 

01:37:40
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

01:37:40
JON CARLSON . . . on this notion that he's significant to Nancy. 

01:37:40
SCOTT MILLER Right. And I think all therapists are in the business of selling a story. The question is do you sell them a story that they can take out and implement on their own, using their own strengths and fix their own life or do you want to sell them a story in which you're cast in the--as in the hero or the protagonist role. You're the expert. Pretty much what I, I feel like because I'm in awe of this guy. I really don't know anything about him or his life. I have to learn that from him and the stuff that's interesting to me is not his pain and suffering. The stuff that really fascinates me about this guy is that he's, ah, that he adapts to the situation and he tries very hard to make this relationship work. 

01:38:20
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. Yeah, I think your awe was apparent, you know . . . 

01:38:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:38:20
JON CARLSON . . . as we watched the, the session. 

01:38:25
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:38:25
JON CARLSON That you just seemed to, you know, just look at him as though he was really special. 

01:38:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:38:30
3-26 

01:38:30
JON CARLSON And that seemed to come across. 

01:38:30
SCOTT MILLER Thanks. 

01:38:30
DIANE KJOS But it came across to me in that, that, you know, the, the more I watched this, the more I like him. 

01:38:40
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, of course. 

01:38:40
DIANE KJOS You know, you make him almost--you don't make him but you let out--come out, all of that charm or innate goodness that he has. 

01:38:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. In fact, my sense is that most diagnostic appraisals are a very limited view of people. You can only maintain that view if, in fact, by distance from the client. Once you get closer and you start to see a, a broader picture, this kind of richness emerges. 

01:39:00
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. Hmm. 

01:39:00
JON CARLSON Well, if this continues on, he might actually be the therapist. 

01:39:05
SCOTT MILLER In fact, my sense is that all therapy is self-help therapy. 

01:39:10
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

01:39:10
SCOTT MILLER Ah, there is no such thing as the, as me helping him. It's my witnessing, ah, his, his abilities and his strengths and resources. 

01:39:20
DIANE KJOS And validating them. 

01:39:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

01:39:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:39:20
3-27 

01:39:20
JON CARLSON Let's watch a clip that occurred just before you took a break. 

01:39:25
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:39:25
SCOTT MILLER Well, Scott, I, I'd like to take a break here . . . 

01:39:30
PATIENT SCOTT Okay. 

01:39:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . for five or six minutes. 

01:39:30
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds good. 

01:39:30
SCOTT MILLER Think about what you've told me about. 

01:39:35
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:39:35
SCOTT MILLER As I said earlier, if, uhm, anything, you know, as you think about . . . 

01:39:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:39:40
SCOTT MILLER . . . our chat. 

01:39:40
PATIENT SCOTT Right. 

01:39:40
SCOTT MILLER As brief as it's been. 

01:39:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:39:45
SCOTT MILLER If anything, uhm, stands out as sort of like, yeah . . . 

01:39:50
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:39:50
PATIENT SCOTT . . . that you want to think about or, ah, feel like you need to think a little bit more about, I think that's kind of the kind of guy you are anyway. 

01:39:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:39:55
SCOTT MILLER Or you feel like, I need to do more of that. 

01:39:55
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:39:55
SCOTT MILLER Share it with me when I come back. 

01:40:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Sounds good. 

01:40:00
SCOTT MILLER Good enough? 

01:40:00
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:40:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. 

01:40:00
PATIENT SCOTT Sounds good to me. 

01:40:00
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:40:00
PATIENT SCOTT I can handle that. 

01:40:00
SCOTT MILLER Good. 

01:40:05
JON CARLSON What are you hoping to accomplish on this break? 

01:40:05
3-28 

01:40:05
SCOTT MILLER Well, I think there are two parts to it. Uhm, and it's exactly what I say on the tape, I, I'd like to take some time to think about what you've said. And I also want to give the client some space away from me and my questions to think about what's happened, if there might be things we haven't talked about that they want to bring up. Ah, or, ah, pull the story together. 

01:40:25
JON CARLSON What are you doing? You, you have all this writing that you're doing. 

01:40:30
SCOTT MILLER In my sessions? 

01:40:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:40:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, well, this is something that I, that I learned early to, to do. I, I essentially all I write down are client's idiosyncratic verbal expressions. 

01:40:40
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

01:40:40
SCOTT MILLER That's, that's all I write down. And it gives me a way to wat-, to watch the flow of the session. 

01:40:45
DIANE KJOS Give me an example of what you might have written down. 

01:40:50
SCOTT MILLER Well, the client uses some very interesting language, ah, when he talks about Nancy, for example. The way he describes her, the way he talks about her. I, I try to copy and use that language when I'm asking my questions. 

01:41:00
UH-HUH. DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:41:00
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:41:00
SCOTT MILLER Plus, if I'm getting stuck, as I said earlier, then I'll go back and look at how he's talked about, ah, himself, and I'll repeat that to him using his words hopefully. 

01:41:10
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:41:10
JON CARLSON And on the break, you were doing some writing off of the camera. 

01:41:15
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:41:15
2-29 

01:41:15
JON CARLSON It looked like you were almost writing out, you know, a, a narrative of some sort. 

01:41:20
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. I'm thinking about what did he say to me so that I can relay that back to him that he feels understood by me. What can I say to him to validate his strengths and resources, and also any ideas I have about the direction he's going. In particular, about, about the last part, I want to make sure that that fits with his evolving theory about how change is going to take place in his life. My idea is that the way this gentlemen thinks that change is going to take place is by thinking carefully though things and looking for signs that he's making the right decision. 

01:41:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:41:55
SCOTT MILLER That's just how he seems to operate based on the information I have today. I'm going to say, good enough, do that. 

01:42:00
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:42:00
JON CARLSON Well, in our final clip, let's watch this closing scene. 

01:42:05
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:42:05
3-30 

01:42:05
SCOTT MILLER So my only sort of suggestion, uhm, is to simply, ah, pay attention, because of your-- the observant person you are, is to pay attention to the signs that, ah, you can feel confident . . . 

01:42:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:20
SCOTT MILLER . . . over the next six months. 

01:42:20
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:25
SCOTT MILLER So every time you notice something, I want you to keep your eyes open for signs that you can and should feel confident. 

01:42:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:30
SCOTT MILLER And notice those signs and then talk . . . 

01:42:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:30
SCOTT MILLER . . . about them with Nancy. 

01:42:30
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:30
SCOTT MILLER Share them with Nancy. 

01:42:35
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:35
SCOTT MILLER So the, you know, when she tells her mother, you know, you noticed it. 

01:42:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:40
SCOTT MILLER And then say . . . 

01:42:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. 

01:42:40
SCOTT MILLER That meant, that meant something to me. 

01:42:40
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:42:45
SCOTT MILLER That's my only, that's my only thought. 

01:42:45
PATIENT SCOTT Uh-huh. Well, I'm just thinking here, sometimes I get a little bit depressed. 

01:42:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-huh. 

01:42:50
PATIENT SCOTT And I don't, you know, I'll be going along all of a sudden . . . 

01:42:50
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:42:50
PATIENT SCOTT And then I'll get depressed for a couple of says. I have no idea why I do that, but, and sometimes, you know, I'm just here and then there's some days I'll completely hit the bottom. 

01:43:05
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:43:05
PATIENT SCOTT I just don't even feel like doing diddly-squat. 

01:43:05
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:43:05
PATIENT SCOTT But most of the time, it don't last but a few days and then that's it. 

01:43:10
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:43:10
PATIENT SCOTT I have no idea why. 

01:43:10
SCOTT MILLER Okay. And so help me understand. What have you, what have you learned about that as a result of . . . 

01:43:15
3-31 

01:43:20
PATIENT SCOTT Well, I try not to get there. 

01:43:20
SCOTT MILLER Okay. All right. 

01:43:20
JON CARLSON Wow, what was happening with you when you kind of tied this up so nicely and then he dropped this thing about being depressed and severely depressed. 

01:43:30
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, actually I think that, that, ah, this was my mistake. And let me tell you why. Uhm, when the segment starts, I asked him had he had any thoughts and he says no, just basically sitting here. But I know from everything that he's told me that he takes time to think through things. So my sense is I should have given him a bit more time when I came back to sort of think. 

01:43:55
DIANE KJOS Oh. 

01:43:55
SCOTT MILLER And give me some reflections. And I'm sure that this would have come up before my, my nice sew-up job took place. 

01:44:00
DIANE KJOS Hmm. 

01:44:00
SCOTT MILLER As it is, I feel quite honored by this, this comment. I not exactly sure what to make of it. Uhm, but it may be an opportunity for the two of us to continue to relate . . . 

01:44:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:44:10
SCOTT MILLER . . . ah, to one another in a therapy relationship. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS And you do offer that action. 

01:44:15
3-32 

01:44:15
SCOTT MILLER Of course. I, I, would be very willing, ah, to continue seeing people. 

01:44:20
DIANE KJOS Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:44:20
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, as long as they, they consider it meaningful. Again, this guy seems to have a very small, ah, circle of people that he, ah, talks to. Remember, he said that he took several months before he talked with his uncle. Within an hour, he's saying, I'd like to come back and talk to you. 

01:44:40
DIANE KJOS He wants to talk to you some more. 

01:44:40
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:44:40
SCOTT MILLER I feel very honored by that. 

01:44:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:44:40
JON CARLSON Now one of your pathologically oriented colleagues might have gotten to this quicker, might have begun with maybe getting him to talk about this depression if they would have used--done some selective attending to some of the different cues that he was putting forth. 

01:45:00
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

01:45:00
JON CARLSON Any reaction to that? 

01:45:00
SCOTT MILLER So what? 

01:45:05
JON CARLSON Isn't that where the real meat is in therapy is to get into that pathology? I mean, he seemed to want to talk about it. 

01:45:10
3-33 

01:45:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah, only, only in the most narrow kind of way would I say that that's the real meat here. What I hear in this, can we be together. Can we relate. I trust you. If what you heard was I'm sick, you help me, I think that's missing the point. 

01:45:25
JON CARLSON So some people might think that you missed the boat since this came up at the end of the session where you're thinking that, ah . . . 

01:45:30
SCOTT MILLER I have another opportunity to relate to him. 

01:45:35
JON CARLSON This is well, well along the way. You've made some really good progress. 

01:45:35
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

01:45:35
DIANE KJOS And, and you're feeling good because he's willing now to tell you about the depression. 

01:45:40
SCOTT MILLER Of course. 

01:45:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:45:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:45:40
JON CARLSON Hey great. Hey, thank you. 

01:45:45
SCOTT MILLER You bet. 

01:45:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah.
