COUNSELING AND THERAPY WITH NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS A Video presentation by Dr. Teresa Lafromboise, Miami Nation and Stanford University. INTRODUCTION 

00:00:00
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Good afternoon and welcome to this presentation on counseling American Indians. This afternoon I'd like to, ah, outline some of the assumptions that Indian people hold about psychology, ah, go over the assumptions that psychologists hold about Indians, and then ah, discuss the counseling implications of these different perspectives. Before I do that, I'd like to, uhm, say that it's quite an honor to be asked to present uhm, the ideas that I'll be presenting are not my own, ah, alone, they, ah, certainly are the work of a number of Indian scholars and Indian psychologist. I'll try to, uhm, indicate who they are as we, as we go along and uhm, to say that you know I'm, I'm pleased to be ah, again asked to do this. Before I do this, I think I should say that, uhm, I'd like to dedicate this work to, uhm, two Indian psychologists, ah, that are considered to be our elders, Dr. Carolyn Attneave and Dr. Art McDonald. Dr. Attneave, Carolyn for the work that she's done on tribal network therapy uhm, that has been applied not only to, ah, Indian communities but to communities here in the United States and a number of, of places abroad. And the other is, ah, Dr. McDonald for the work that he's done in trying to bridge, uhm, a link between academic psychology and reservation life at, uhm, on Northern Cheyenne Reservation with, at, ah, Dull Knife Memorial College in trying to bring more students from there into traditional universities like the University of North Dakota. So with those two individuals in mind, let's begin. 

00:02:05
Some Key Background Facts 

00:02:05
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  When we talked about counseling American-Indians, one of the, uhm, ah, sort staggering things to begin with is the amount of diversity within in a community. There are some 350 federally recognized tribes, and when we include state recognized tribes, uhm, Alaskan native villages and rural communities where there are pockets of Indian families, uhm, we then they never could go upward to around 525. 

00:02:40
Diversity - 500 tribes and nations 

00:02:40
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Indian people live in, ah, rural and reservation areas but there are growing numbers of Indian people who live in urban areas. According to the '90 census, more than 50 percent live in urban areas. 

00:02:50
Half are in urban settings 

00:02:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  And many people go back and forth frequently, ah, couple of times a weeks so there's a lot of, ah, mobility within the community. If you were looking for a generalization about Indian people, I think you could say that the Indian community is distinguished by a number of, uhm, interlocking ties among close net groups of people. There may be factionalism but there's certainly an ability to get strong group cohesion in time of crisis. That occurs a lot because Indian people have historically suffered- 

00:03:25
Key cultural losses 

00:03:25
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Tremendous amount of spiritual, social, economic, and cultural loss. These losses are certainly very apparent today in, ah, Indian communities and some examples would be the lost of language. There are, um, only about eighty tribal languages that are still spoken today and that is very important, ah, because some tribes believed that you cannot communicate with the creator unless your communicating in your tribal language. Uhm, also very more personalize education methods, ah, like friendship(ph) training is, uhm, seldom practiced, uhm, primarily only in terms transmitting cultural knowledge where it is at least done much more previously and certainly that's been eradicated to the boarding school movement and also the dominant culture expectations. Uhm, and then clear social roles such as, uhm, egalitarian, ah, gender roles in which men and women work together for the survival of the family or survival of the group. Uhm, these roles are not so clearly defined now a days and do sometimes cause a quite a bit of confusion. Only a few community-based epidemiological studies in Indian communities. There are more being done, uhm, by the National Center for American Indian/Alaskan Native Mental Health Research. I think when you review those, you can see that there is a fairly consistent pattern of the problems that are presented when Indian people, ah, seek mental health services- 

00:05:00
Counseling issues 

00:05:00
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Particularly, ah, in Indian health service, ah, delivery centers. And those are primarily depression, uhm, anxiety and adjustment reactions. Coupled with these problems often are problems with, ah, drug and, ah, alcohol abuse. I think it's also safe to say, ah, it's not pleasant to say, but safe to say that there are disproportionate levels of violence, child abuse, and neglect, and other symptoms of distressed families, uhm, apparent and, and increasing, and unfortunately in some communities becoming the norm. There's, ah, in addition to the diversity, the tribal diversity and certainly the variances in terms of where people live, there is also a lot of variation in terms of the commitment that Indian people hold to maintaining their tribal heritage. Doctors Bob and Loye Ryan have, uhm, developed, uhm, a category system of five categories of Indianess using acculturation as the reference in trying to asses where Indian people are initially when they present themselves in therapy. I think it's, uhm, I mean, I'm going to present these categories but I also think that a word of caution should be brought here and that is, it's very, very difficult to think of acculturation as a, ah, unidimensional phenomena. Ah, certainly Amado Padilla's work on acculturation would indicate that it's very, uhm, very, uhm, multidimensional could occur in terms language, close relationships, amount of cultural loyalty, amount of, uhm, adherence to cultural values, so, et cetera. So people fall in various places on these continua of, of acculturation. But according to the Ryan's, the, the first category would be the traditional person. And a traditional person, ah, is a person who thinks and speaks in their native language and may know very, very little English. Certainly, they practice old time ways and traditions. This person will probably not present themselves in therapy. The second category is- 

00:07:15
Transitional 

00:07:15
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE A tradition, I mean, transitional person and this person, ah, speaks both their native language and, uhm, and English, uhm, at you know, at home as well as, uhm, out in, you know, day-to-day activities, but this person is, is for the most part maybe questioning basic tenets of traditional religion and cultural practices, and also questioning a lot about dominant cultural expectations as well. So it's a period of transition from being more traditional into the next category, which is called the marginal category. 

00:07:50
Marginal 

00:07:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  There's a lot written about the marginal man and I would say, or person. This person is very defensively Indian. Ah, maybe, uhm, having a difficult time coping with the problems of, uhm, being unable to adhere to either their tribal heritage or the expectations of the dominant society. Uhm, the media portrays this person as being stranded between two worlds and, uhm, and having a difficult time managing them. And certainly, the work of Oetting and Beauvais in the Southwest would attest to this. According to their work, it's not the person who is highly identified with the dominant culture or the person that might be highly identified with tribal culture, uhm, but it's a person who doesn't have any, very much identification with either that experiences problems. The fourth category is an assimilated, ah, person. And this person has for the most part, uhm, abandoned, uhm, cultural teachings and, ah, accepts dominant cultural values and to certain extent is embraced by the dominant culture. The final category is one that people are talking about more now today and this, uhm, this labeled by the Ryan's as a bicultural category. An Indian person who falls in this category, ah, moves effectively between ah, ah, their tribal background and traditions and the expectations of the dominant society. Uhm, this person instead of having, uhm, uhm, a primary loyalty to the Indian community or even a dual loyalty as some people say, and so how can you, how can you really have, you know, not have a preference one way or the other? Uhm, it could be characterized as just having multiple loyalties. Uhm, they may live in a world of complex multiple loyalties, uhm, and this world can challenge, uhm, can really reinforce and support you, ah, can also sometimes debilitate you but I think it's safe say that people within this category do not lose their Indianess. Those who do effectively function between the two worlds, uhm, may have, uhm, a better lifestyle than those that lived in only one. At least, that's what some of the literature might say. Certainly, ah, we find that people are more self-actualized and, uhm, the bilingual literature would say, uhm, certainly more stimulated cognitively and, and maybe functioning better than those who live in only one world. 

00:10:30
Moving Between Two Worlds Indian Way Of Life Dominant Culture Way Of Life 

00:10:30
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  I guess some of you can think about, uhm, what it might be like to be delivering services, uhm, three days a week at a conventional counseling center where clients are, ah, all booked for you, people come right on hour, you get off, get out after a 50-minute hour, you do your case noted, et cetera, and then, ah, going a couple days a week, uhm, to the reservation clinic where, uhm, your work maybe, may involved a lot more outreach and community, ah, meetings, and occasionally having a session with the person. I think Indian people are used to going back and forth between two worlds, uhm, all the time. Studies of, uhm, Indian people who are, are bicultural often, uhm, look at sort some of the, ah, think about leadership qualities that might influence a person to even do this and I think about the people who traveled from their reservation communities to Washington to work and, uhm, to negotiate treaties and, and work with the government and how difficult at times that may have been. Certainly, uhm, some of us say that it's, it's really in the person's mind that these worlds collide and this, uhm, painting was done, I think, to depict that. This is a picture obviously of a traditional Navajo woman who is, uhm, uhm, alone, ah, you know, weaving and this is something that she does on a regular basis. Uhm, I've chosen this slide because of, uhm, it's certainly this is a picture that could very well be the, the next lady that was sees(ph), mother or grandmother. She is a student. This is, ah, Dr. Mary Havatone while she was at Stanford University in Escondido Village and this is something that she would do, uhm, on fairly regular basis to manage her stress as a graduate student and also to, you know, to keep up her skills in this area. She's acquired another technology here. The hard work of being a single parent and, ah, completing her degree, she's now, uhm, a professor of linguistics at University of New Mexico. This slide is taken, ah, from Alcatraz Island right off the San Francisco bay, and uhm, it certainly shows the contrast in images and cultures that, that people are used to and of course, there was a period of time in which native people occupy the Alcatraz Island. Uhm, I used to work with a, a woman there, ah, Woesha Cloud North, who would take the ferry every, every Monday to, ah, to teach the kids so that they would, would not, uhm, you know, lose their ability, you know, to get credit even though the people were there on the island. A few years ago ah, the late Mouz Pamp developed program for its, Title 4 programs that was called The Bridge Between Two Worlds. And the emphasis here again was on the adaptive abilities of people, who, uhm, operate between traditional cultures and open environments. And certainly, this, this image reminds of, of that. I think this is the dilemma that a lot of students, uhm, and people have between, ah, because the cultures collide a lot in the educational arena and, ah, questions is often raise in counseling if a person can, ah, participate in ceremonial activities and still be successful in higher education. I think this image depicts that. Obviously, there are many aspects of American culture that are influence by native Americans and certainly this, ah, this fashionable, uhm, dress is, ah, something that you would, you know, comes from, uhm, Alaskan native area but it's also very interesting when you see people who are, uhm, who like to wear Indian, Indian designs. And this, this image, uhm, is a very contemporary image but it certainly, uhm, shows one area as well in addition to education where Indian people have been very, very active, and that is in, uhm, being, uhm, patriotic and, ah, protecting this country. And finally, this image from, ah, was taken from Vietnam and, ah, there you see the eagle feather and I think that this conveys to us that, ah, in many capacities, when Indian people are operating in, ah, even in, within the dominant society that they always take their, ah, carry their spirituality close to them and, and with them at all times. 

00:15:25
VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS HOLD TOWARD PSYCHOLOGY AND MENTAL HEALTH 

00:15:25
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Various assumptions that Indian people hold about psychology. Certainly, in contrast to the ones that I'll be talking about a little bit later on. But, uhm, when people start talking about psychology and, and metal health, uhm, particularly Indian people, they get concerned about lack of the sense of connectedness or, uhm, community that are inherent in terms like mental health, personality or self. Uhm, Doctor, Bea Medicine, ah, wrote a few years ago about concepts of mental health and, and talked, reminded us that among, ah, Lakota people that the, the idea of being, uhm, ah, of being in health is called, ah, the word is Taun(ph) which means being a state of well-being. And in order to, ah, to be in well being, it involves an incredible amount of introspection and, um, concern, ah, and advance thinking about how people relate to others. With the Hopi tribe, this idea of well being is, uhm, described as a person that is very peaceful person that exudes a lot of strength and self control through the personal discipline it takes be able to adhere to universal Indian values or Hopi values. Joseph Trimble has labeled this values as, uhm, by primarily wisdom, kindness, cooperation, ah, poise, tranquility, uhm, responsibility and a protectiveness of all life forms. And so with the Hopi, if you are a peaceful person, you live according to these values, you are in well being. Uhm, the Navajos would call this, ah, walking in beauty. 

00:17:30
Walking in Beauty 

00:17:30
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  But the images is, is very different than one of being very focused on one's self. Uhm, also when people uhm, think about ah, psychology or, or well being- 

00:17:45
Integration of spirituality and well being 

00:17:45
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Immediately, the shift is towards Indian spirituality. 

00:17:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Spirituality is very different than, ah, sort of a narrow focus that people think of when they think about religion and the person developing their relationship with God. Uhm, and this spirituality encompasses many things and, ah, a person is, ah, very concern about their relations with their family and their family could be people who have passed away, uhm, the current family and people yet to be born. But that relationship is a very spiritual one. It's also, uhm, the important in terms of ones relationship to all other living beings, and also to, uhm, the people that are unseen in the spirit world. So there are many, many types of people and those relationships are very important and, and they're very spiritual in nature. So in order to practice this way of life, ah, there are number of men and women that are considered, uhm, ah, spiritual leaders, ah, traditional healers. Some people called them medicine men, medicine women and, ah, these people encourage Indian people not to separate ideas about spirituality and one's well being or to separate mental and physical health, uhm, or to separate, uhm, community and from individuals in terms of locus of intervention, certainly not to separate healing practices from prevention activities. And then lastly, I guess, not to separate cultural ideals from clinical practice. They really emphasize an interdependence between spiritual and emotional health. And in order to continue to keep this at the forefront of Indians ways of life, they organize a, a set of rituals that people, ah, may elect to go through, that have, uhm, uhm, not only a healing function but also a prevention function. And people who are involve in this ceremonial life often get involved in a type gift exchange that commits the person that is wanting to be involved in this way of life to, uhm, ah, sort of, ah, an involvement in future ceremonies. I mean, you don't just go for one ceremony. You become immersed in a way of life. Now, through this, uhm, ceremonial or activities, people, uhm, develop a world view in which they see the universe as a complex balance among, ah, spiritual forces or transcendental forces, ah, human beings and the natural environment. And these forces are mutually compatible as long as there is a respect for how transactions are handled, uhm, among these forces. Ah, for instance, there's a lot, you know, sanctions against, ah, certain activities, such as incest or, ah, certainly sanctions against, uhm, ah, various ways that people might communicate with one another. Ah, there, you know, maybe prohibitions against things like, uhm, son, ah, son-in-law, ah, looking at his mother-in-law, et cetera, and it's very tribally specific. But as long as people respect these, uhm, rules about how things are handled, these, these forces can, can work cooperatively. Now, uhm, in addition to managing these rituals, uhm, and, and, ah, ceremonials, healers are also, uhm, entrusted with the, ah, role of - 

00:21:20
Stories educate for mental health and health 

00:21:20
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Keeping, being the safe-keeper of, of the stories, uhm, in the community. And I'll talk more about that very important role when we talk about the power of this spoken word. But many, ah, traditional stories or stories that are passed on, uhm, have, ah, a function of, of educating us and certainly of giving us insight into human behavior. Some are merely to entertain but, but, a lot of them give insight into how to handle various psychological behavioral problems, and the healers, uhm, and, uhm, or the tribal historians are safe-keepers of those stories. The, ah, traditional healers also reinforce for us, not the spiritual aspect of mental health, but they also emphasize how important it is to practice prevention. 

00:22:15
Ceremonies help maintain balance 

00:22:15
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE There are, uhm, a number of ceremonies but the three that I would like to talk about, uhm, that originated with the Lakota Sioux tribe that are practiced amongst a lot of, ah, tribes in the plains area and increasingly more among other tribes today, uhm, have as a function not only to heal but to prevent the, the, the, ah, Vision Quest, the Sweat Lodge ceremony and the Give Away, uhm, are trying to prevent the onset or recurrence of disease. The, uhm, Vision Quest, where a person basically, ah, isolates himself for, ah, a period of time, uhm, in fast in order to seek a vision is really, uhm, an attempt on the part of this individual to discover what their role is, within the community in terms of, uhm, advancing the well being of the community. Uhm, also to determine, you know, to solidify their identity, adolescence, et cetera, but really to the just say, "How am I, you know, what am I suppose to do to help out in, in, within my tribe?" Uhm, the Sweat Lodge ceremony, which is a series of purification rituals, is really not to cure as much as is to maintain health and renew energy. And finally, the give away ceremony is, uhm, is really an act of thanksgiving. Ah, when, when a family or, ah, has a Give Away, it's in thanksgiving that a person has accomplished a certain deed, uhm, ah, being given a certain honor, uhm, and it may very well be thanksgiving that things are good within this family and no one has become ill. Uhm, this, this, ah, Give Away also emphasizes the importance of balance - material balance, in terms of maintaining the well-being of the community. And, uhm, it emphasizes the fact that a person has to be, ah, individually responsible in order to, ah, be able to be generous in this way, to be able to be prosperous and to share it with others, and certainly this person is respectful of social obligations. When a person is seeking help from a healer, uhm, or, uhm, medicine person, the first task is to really examine, ah, oneself and their actions, ah, to do a lot of preparation before even contacting that person. So the emphasize here is on, uhm, ah, a lot of introspection and character development. And so if you had a problem, it would be to find out. 

00:24:50
Illness caused by violation of cultural values 

00:24:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE What your role is in this problem. Ah, not to, ah, look at, well, this is what this person said and, and, ah, look at the inner, the dynamics between the, the, the people who are having conflict or finding out what the social circumstances, where those things really don't matter. It's what, you know, who you are as an individual, uhm, what you've done to adhere, you know, to, to your, to maintaining your path of, of goodness and, ah, and seeing where you may have, of, uhm, varied from some of that. When, ah, Indian people are, see that a person is ill, uhm, they, they often going to question why this person might be il. And, uhm, ah, this illness could come from, ah, a number of things that some people would believe that you've done something, ah, ah, to sort of, ah, transgress the sanctions of the group or else you wouldn't be ill. Uhm, so you bring embarrassment, either to yourself or your family. Ah, some people believe that you maybe, have been, ah, well, the Navajos would say, witched or, ah, bad medicine has been practiced on you, uhm, and, so that's one of the reasons. But I would say that, ah, another way that people feel, ah, in terms of the cause of illness or you might say the cause of psychological disturbance is that you really haven't been, uhm, ah, well-disciplined to maintain the cultural values. Uhm, we're weak, we're lazy and, ah, and it's because of not maintaining those traditional values. Uhm, even the emphasis on individuality in terms of their abili, ability to sponsor, say, a give way, is not so much to, for individual achievement, but it is the fact that by achieving, you, then can contribute to, uhm, making things happen within the community and enhancing the strength of the community. The more people who are, ah, able to do this, the stronger the efficacy or sense of, of, of confidence about the community that, that it is strong. So the emphasis on maintaining traditional values is, uhm, really there in order to, uhm, help control sort of this natural tendency that human beings might have to be preoccupied with themselves or to focus on their symptoms. I mean, because the, the maintaining of the values is for the larger good of the community. 

00:27:20
Individual problems seen as a community problem 

00:27:20
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE When problems arise in Indian communities, they are not the problem of the individual. They become the problems of the community or the family. Uhm, the family, the network, uhm, various relatives kind of join together to try to understand why this person is disturbed or why they're acting unusual? Why they are this way? So there, there's this observation to try to figure out what's going on. There's also an attempt to describe what it is and then to really within that network, make things happen so that these individuals brought back into what's going on within the community or within the family. To bring them back, instead of being more isolated and withdrawn, but bring them back into the life of the group. This, uhm, you know, this, ah, sense of, of cohesion that I mentioned earlier, uhm, this strong, uhm, bond surface and this is what (inaudible [00:28:16.295]) worked on. And that is, helping the sense of network be revitalized again in order to maintain people who are disturbed. Her work was so, uhm, affective because it happened during the, ah, the, the institutionalization movement, but it was to help, you know, maintain disturbed individuals in the community rather than institutionalizing them. Ah, another practice in Indian community, the practice of bartering or giving, uhm, you know, sharing of responsibilities and give and take of services or, uhm, ah, ah, property and services is another way to help fairly, uhm, people who are fairly low functioning or uhm- 

00:28:55
Problem-resolution may involve entire families or communities 

00:28:55
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - that are, uhm, less, less involved to be very active part of the life. Everyone has a role in order to make activities happen. And so this is another opportunity to bring fairly isolated people into, you know, the, uhm, the livelihood or what's going on. In some, some tribes, ah, person who might be considered mentally ill or very disturbed maybe, ah, adopted into a new clan group or into, uhm, uhm, into a new family. Now, in terms of the, the, the treatment of people who are, are very psychologically disturbed, uhm- 

00:29:35
Example community therapy strategies 

00:29:35
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - it's very, very different than what we think of, ah, as 101 counseling, uhm, or even therapy groups. The, the, uhm, those people would be encouraged to attend community meetings, uhm, prayer meetings, those who belonged to the Native American church, that would be peyote meetings. And this, uhm, this kind of cure is more ritualized. It's really collective informal discussions. There're not so much personal discussions. And the therapeutic agents that are involved were very different than, ah, than just talking. It may involve confession of, of sorts' testimonials that may, ah, require people, uhm, sort of atoning for their bad acts. It maybe, ah, making restitution within a certain family or it may even be intercession with, uhm, people from the spirit world. Uhm, so this involves a lot more than just a counselor and client, or thinking of this, the pillar and the person who's seeking, ah, healing. It involves, uhm, ah, certainly a, the extended family and to some extent, a, a number of the community members. It's a very collective kind of thing. Now, this kind of treatment then, uhm, of individuals collectively, uhm, not only serves to help heal the individual, but it certainly serves to strengthen the, ah, norms and expectations of, of this, of the group. So the goal then in this kind of work is not to help a client, uhm, strengthen their ego or, uhm, it's more to transcend the sense of individualism and to, uhm, experience the self as embedded in and, ah, a part of and very expressive of the community. So, uhm, ideas like, uhm, ah, self-esteem, uhm, insight, uhm, ambivalences kind of inner, uhm, motivations are very much ignored. And symptoms are transformed into more social categories or, uhm, uhm, you know, descriptions of socially, uh, activities rather than individual kinds of things. Through the interconnectedness then and this revitalization of the network, uhm, new problems, I mean, new solutions can be made for problems and certainly or different or new ways of looking at, at problems that exist, can happen. Now, this is very different than assumptions that psychologists have about Indian people. Uhm, a number of, of people in the helping professions and in the social sciences have tried to, uhm, describe, measure and, uhm, understand tribal and social phenomena for a number of years, many decades. And there are, ah, substantial number of, of, of works, great knowledge-based to document problems of Indian people, but really, there has been much done to solve those problems. Uhm, even those interventions that have been developed, ah, and applied or transported into work with Indian people, are, are fairly an excepting of this more, uhm, collective and transcendent way- 

00:32:50
Transcending individual difference through community. 

00:32:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - of, of operating that I've just described. There are, the case studies and treatment reports that do, ah, that do exist and when you examine them, they rarely, rarely ever account for the functional aspects of certain problems or, ah, pay much attention to the, ah, the effectiveness of the coping strategies that had been used by people that, that are used. And I think certainly, when you look at the resilience of elders, uhm, that you're looking at people that have, uhm, withstood, I'm not, uhm, you know, uhm, lot of adversity and have been able manage well. And so we don't seem to be, you know, in this treatment accounts really looking at, you know, what was done affectively and, and how people managed thus far. 

00:33:35
END PART 1 ASSUMPTIONS PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE ABOUT INDIAN PEOPLE 

00:33:35
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Another aspect of, of psychology, uhm, uhm, that Indian people question is this, ah, tendency of people in the helping professions to be value free. Uhm, since the time of (inaudible ), psychologist have tried to, uhm, uhm, de-emphasize the role of values, even though the kinds of problems that people bring into therapy- 

00:34:10
General failure of psychology to understand or help. 

00:34:10
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - uhm, like problems in close relationships, ah, problems with adjustment, ah, problems at work are often very, very value-laden. I think that the, ah, people have tried to maintain this position because of the vast amount of diversity of, of religions and various values in Western Society. Uhm, it's only been lately that there are, there's much written in journals about spirituality and counseling. And I think that's been, ah, very- 

00:34:35
Failure to consider spirituality 

00:34:35
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - slow to emerge because of almost historical hostility about things that are spiritual in nature. And certainly, a lot of suspicion among clients that present themselves as highly religious. I remember when I was, uhm, doing my internship, uhm, at a counseling center, there were eight psychologists on staff and two that were labeled, uhm, Christian counselors and people who had questions about their religion, were to be directed to those two individuals. (clears throat) Now, this, ah, this often presents problem because people who are, you know, in the helping professions. 

00:35:15
Counselors may not be trusted 

00:35:15
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Who are considered to be or trying to present themselves as value neutral can be, ah, ah, suspected, uhm, among Indian people. Ah, certainly there is a fear that, ah, the, that these counselors may try to encourage them to be, ah, you know, less concern about values or maybe to, ah, ah, to become involved in the values of the dominant culture. Uhm, and if you'll remember, a lot of the work of healing and, and work around therapy might be, attention paid to the conflicts in values that come about because of the meeting of the two cultures. And as I mentioned earlier, just the healers are not only safe-keepers, of, uhm, of the stories, but also they, ah, are the keepers of the values and the tribe. Another, ah, assumption that's kind of difficult, ah, that psychologists hold. 

00:36:10
Problems in dualism 

00:36:10
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Is this tendency often to create dualisms. In some people, this has been labeled by Dell as an Aristotelian world view. And this is emphasized a lot on, emphasis on, ah, individualism and personal agents, agency, which has been very effective in making, ah, a number of people within the U.S. society. The privilege classes are, uhm, maybe very prosperous materially. They may have a lot of freedom, a lot of prosperity. And so that's the upside, but of course, there's, uhm, a lot to be said about the feelings of alienation and, uhm, ah, narcissism that, ah, people, you know, experienced that are always focused on themselves. And certainly, maybe it's, ah, it may have advance though, the case loads of psychologists where people who'd have very few friends, ah, and certainly live away from their family because they're working at their upward mobility, need to purchase, ah, friendship in counseling. Certainly, the emphasis on, ah, self-control, individual rights, competencies training, does not say much for, uhm, the importance of, of the sense of community that I mentioned before. Even the, ah, biomedical origin of the term like mental health is a dualism, again separating mind from body. And, ah, another dualism that I think, we think a lot about certainly in university settings and that is, uhm, the difference between empirically based scientific therapy interventions versus alternative, uhm- 

00:37:45
Prevention difficulties 

00:37:45
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - indigenous, uhm, helping systems. Another issue was the guild issue. And, ah, I think that's very, very critical in terms of Indian people. Ah, lot of the real therapy that's done is done by paraprofessionals, by community health representatives, mental health technicians. Hence the, the, uhm, field of the psychology has a very difficult time accepting, ah, these people as bona fide professionals. Ah, certainly they undergo a lot of scrutiny, maybe more scrutiny than regular, ah, well, certainly professional or psych, psycholo, the psychologist at least at that level. And, ah, there are articles that talked about the work of counselors as being helpful and there are few unfortunately that talked about the work of healers as being largely magical. Uhm, another differences in the way that prevention is handled, when we talked about sort of this transcending, uhm, collaborative flavor, you know, of, of the ceremonies in trying to prevent illness, uhm, that's very different than the kind of, ah, prevention activities that certainly the, uhm, uhm, ah, HMO's and, and, ah, some counseling centers will deliver, where we look at high-risk groups and have this pre-packaged, you know, interventions that we can pull off the shelf, you know, to, to, uhm, to help in certain circumstances. Even involved recently on an attempt to culturally tailor a preventionary activity, that was fairly superficial. Ah, it really involved convening a group of, ah, of, uhm, ah, Indian experts and coming up with four or five themes that would be infused into a, ah, ah, already existing program. This is a very, very aloof kind of activity and it's very different from the transformation that we talked about in terms of spirituality. 

00:39:35
THE COUNSELING IMPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES 

00:39:35
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  And then finally, uhm, the other assumption is the one about the difficulty in combining therapies. Even though we talked about the fact that counselors are primary of, very eclectic in their theoretical orientation that still look down upon uhm, and we are very concerned if our, our clients are seeing another therapist when, ah, consumers do this all the time. They combine, ah, different forms of treatment and maybe even theoretically conflicting treatments. But consumers do that and, uhm, and we, we as professionals have a difficult time with it in psychology as profession does. And Indian people have little trouble at all in integrating, ah, traditional healing, ah, or more traditional practices with conventional therapy. And that's what I would like to, you know, to, to talk about now. It's the implication of combi, combining these approaches, ah, within the backdrop of how these, you know, we these different assumptions operating from the, the two different worlds. In giving these different ah, assumptions that Indian people hold about psychology and psychology holds about Indian people, you can see that there might be some, ah, concern about entering into, uhm, the therapy process. I think it can be said that Indian people are generally, fairly reluctant to seek formal psychological services. And a lot of this has to do with an emphasis on endurance and in general mistrust of the helping professions. And or other people for that matter that, you know, that enter into the community trying to be helpful. There's a fairly predictable pattern about health seeking and that is that if a person is, ah, experiencing a lot of problems, they would go first to talk with people within their extended family network. If, if people are not available within that family system, then they might seek help from a spiritual leader or a respected, ah, community leader. And then finally, as a last resort they would try the mainstream mental health system. There have been, though, however, ah, an increase of people seeking formal services probably because of the, ah, increasing member of Indian people at all levels of service delivery. There are more Indian people beyond the paraprofessional level now. And also, I think there's a greater awareness of the range of services that are available. Ah, certainly the growing caseloads and the increased number of referrals even in reservation communities, which show this sort of attitudinal shift. Ah, little is known though about the dropout rate in counseling. Uhm, comparative studies of, uhm, over the course of a decade, certainly the continuation of the work that Stanley Sue had done about, uhm, the dropout rate of Urban Indian clients would say that there is, has been a decrease in this dropout rate, but again that's only in urban areas. We know very little about the dropout rate in reservation communities. The location where traditional mental health's formal mental health centers are located very much shape the kind of, uhm, health that is sought out and the types of people that might seek help, uhm, among Indian clients. In urban areas, these, uhm, ah, urban centers are often located where there's a pocket of Indian people or more in the downtown area and certainly are geared to serve people from diverse tribal affiliations and the clients would know very little probably about the counselors that are working there. Uhm, the clients that would seek help from the center maybe people that have moved to urban areas through, their families of generations ago during the relocation period, ah, and are, have lived in urban area and, uhm, maybe are wanting to discuss personal concerns or they may be, uhm, people who have, uhm, been raised in probably non, non-Indian homes and are hoping to, you know, to learn more about their tribal identity or, or reclaim their innerness, so to speak. And so with, uhm, they seek help because they know that there are Indian therapist on board. There are also, ah, Indian people that are from the reservation that travel back and forth between the reservation and the urban area for employment or to be with family members that, uhm, that come occasionally to urban centers. And certainly, their expectations might be very, very different. They, they may be simply wanting direction about practical information in terms of urban life or, or these, uhm, various issues that come about, come up. Uhm, those reservations, there are sort of village clinics, ah, or mental health centers that usually are services that are located within the IHS. And uhm, these are increasingly more offering travel specific kinds of services. Uhm, the therapist are very often very well known. Uhm, they maybe from the community and if they are, they maybe related to some of the people that they're working with. Ah, and they may be very much involved in community activities or they may be aloof in order to not be, you know, to maintain some of the burn out. But, uhm, here, ah, it's a closer kind of affiliation. Now, in addition to the services that are offered in these reservation clinics, there, ah, as I mentioned early, there's, ah, there's certainly would be among some of the people, uhm, a need to access the traditional healing system. Uhm, they probably, many people have access to a healer, ah, certain family use certain healers, uhm, depending upon the reservation and, and whether this is still practiced. I know, uhm, Dr. Mohatt, Gerry Mohatt, when he was working on the Rosebud Reservation, would, during even part of his intake would be assessing whether or not the client would be, uhm, wanting a healer, and decides whether that happens at the very beginning and tries to arrange for that and then after the, the, ah, person has worked with the medicine person, then begins, ah, adds on therapy or does it certainly in a supplementary way. Ah, some, some clients feel very good about, uhm, being involved with both. 

00:46:30
Traditional healers can compliment mental health services 

00:46:30
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE Traditional healing system and formal services with the idea that what one can't take care of, the other one, uhm, may be able to help. But unfortunately, there are a number of clients or people who, in need of services on reservations that are very, ah, cautious about approaching mental health centers because of the, the closeness of the, of the community. In the extended family system, there's real concern about, ah, confidentiality, uhm, people may be, ah, attributing or, or some, ah, some kind of stigma associated with seeking services. And so they may travel hundreds of miles to a mental health clinic far away from the reservation in order to, uhm, in order to get therapy. In any, ah, account, I think it's really important that, for counselors respect the importance of uhm- 

00:47:25
Spirituality - an important issue for helping 

00:47:25
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - of traditional values and spirituality and world views in developing the relationship. And certainly, uhm, this understanding where a person is coming from will help, ah, us dis, determine what kind of counseling style, what kind of approach might be appropriate for counseling. I think it's safe to say that Indian clients from any walk of life or, uhm, category of Indianess might present issues around spirituality. And I, for people it's not, for therapists, it's not necessary to know specifics about, details about, ah, various spiritual practices as much as it is to maintain an open and supportive atmosphere and, and, and to convey that it's all right to talk about those issues, uhm, in, in counseling. Certainly, that will contribute to the outcome. Sometimes, Indian people again are reluctant to engage in counseling because they're afraid that counselors will superimpose their biases, or those that really advocate kind of introspective counseling may shape a client to, uhm, in a direction that's very different than, than cultural lifestyle and practices. Because of the, ah, extreme amount of, ah, mistreatment of Indian people for centuries by the U.S. government, ah, there's an incredible amount of distrust, uhm- 

00:48:50
Distrust an issue 

00:48:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Broken treaties, ah, violence, ah, the attempts of genocide have fostered a lot of distrust, uhm, of people seeming to help. Uhm, this coupled with racism or anticipated racism that Indian clients may perceive all Indian, non-Indians to have, uhm, it makes it very difficult to, ah, to begin to form the relationship. There is a concern again that maybe that counselors maybe trying, if, if I come in and I share my problems and I (inaudible ) that, ah, and, and express myself that I will, you know, basically, uhm, and reduce my anger that may be legitimate that I may not have that kind of energy that's needed for the kind of advocacy or collective action, uhm, or demonstrations or whatever it takes to really, ah, ah, advocate for tribal rights. There are a number of, of ways of communicating- 

00:49:55
Crucial communication issues 

00:49:55
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - traditional ways of communicating that I think can influence the therapy process. And remember, I spoke earlier about how, because of the oral tradition, there's a lot of respect for methods of communication and certainly, there's a lot of respect for the power of, ah, of words, the power of the spoken words. Uhm, certainly, ah, we know and taught early on that through words we can talk to ourselves, we think, we can influence people, we can inform people. There's, that's the good side. But, ah, words can also be used to hurt, to insult, to threaten, uhm, to, ah, frighten and, and certainly the omissions of words can be used to conceal information from people. So a lot of care is taken in, ah, in the use of words. Uhm, people are taught, ah, early on to be good listeners and certainly were taught not to speak, uhm, you know, ah, loosely or, uhm, spontaneously to really have a purpose in what is said. Uhm, this sort of place itself out in, ah, in counseling in the way that people take great care to explain how they're related to an event that they may be wanting to describe. Uhm, it's very important to show how I come to know what I'm about to tell you. Ah, so, that client may spend a lot of time describing the circumstances that surrounded an event. Ah, maybe even how they, ah, how, how they were anticipating this, what, what, ah, the conditions were like, ah, whether they heard this stuff straight up, firsthand or whether they heard it through the rumor mill, ah, et cetera in order to try to be as exact as possible. Ah, sometimes counselors get annoyed at this when they, they want the client to get down, you know, get to the point. But some of this comes again from the tradition of, uhm, of non-interference and it's, it's sort of a respect for you as the counselor to be able to, uhm, to have, to put together what I'm trying to tell you. 

00:52:10
Native American Indian rhetoric is like the spokes on a wheel and out of respect for the listener the main point may be left implicit 

00:52:10
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Uhm, there was a person at the University of Oklahoma that once analyzed Indian, ah, rhetoric and likened it to spokes on a wheel. Ah, but basically, the, the person who was speaking was telling, ah, all of the circumstances and certainly all the pieces to a puzzle, putting it all together except for the crucial point. And out of respect for the listener, that sort of, uhm, bottom line is, isn't said explicitly, that's left up to the other person. Another, uhm, ah, communication convention is the use of disclaimers. Uhm, Louis Dauphinais, ah, coined this term. And basically, this is the, ah, attempt on the part of a, an Indian person to show their humbleness and to, ah, begin by talking about how little, ah, they may know about this. Or how, uhm, how ah, cautious they are, about saying something and then, uhm, expressing a very, very well thought-out opinion. But, ah, certainly, disclaiming, uhm, their ability to do so at the beginning. Another form of communication that's essential to, ah, ah, understanding therapy is this, ah, importance of non-interference that I mentioned. From, uhm, from childhood on, Indian people are taught to regard any form, even any suggestion of, of, uhm, of- 

00:53:50
Advise considered meddling 

00:53:50
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - advise or, uhm, suggestion as being incredibly, uhm, ah, meddling or manipulative. Uhm, they react to any kind of coercion or forcefulness with being, you know, with disgust and bewilderment, ah, being appalled, et cetera. And so you're taught, you know, because I respect your individuality, uhm, I respect who you are and what you are that I won't, let you make your decisions. Sometimes children make major deci, decisions about their health, et cetera. Uhm, and it depends upon the tribe but this is idea that I don't affear, interfere in another person's life. One way that this, uhm, is communicated, ah, in counseling is that a person would rarely, directly ask for help or direct, or ask for a favor. The way it may be done would be to kind of hint at something that needs to happen or in, indirectly stating the person's need. Now, what this allow us is it allows the person that's sort of being, uhm, ah, ah, requested, uhm, indirectly or, or asking, you know, that, that is asking for help is not, uhm, is allowing the person, the other person, ah, freedom to decide whether or not to pick up on it. And certainly, it saves face, the person doesn't have to tell the person no. And in, ah, in close communities, you really don't have the option of saying no very often when people, ah, need help. Another in, indirect communication form is just gentle probes that the client might have, uhm, to kinda test of limits of the relationship, uhm, but, but not to ask things very, very directly. Now, these conventions also influence the kind of helping style that, that counselors, I mean, that, that clients may, may prefer. Paul Dauphinais has done some research on this in which she compared the uhm, ah, Neo-Rogerian or client-centered approach, the facilitative approach, with a directive approach and what he called the cultural-experimental style. 

00:55:55
Client-centered approach less effective Culture-experimental style appropriate 

00:55:55
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE And, uhm, clearly, the client-centered facilitative approach that we teach people early on in their training was the least effective of the three. The cultural-experimental style that he used, uhm, was, uhm, determined by linguistically analyzing, uhm, the ways in which people that are set out for advise talked to, uhm, someone that's asking for help. And a lot of it, uhm, relies on asking the, ah, person that's seeking help or a few questions and sort of sizing up what the problem might be, and then, uhm, using some examples of how other people, uhm, have handled the similar kind of problem or maybe telling a story about a similar kind of situation. Ah, that's the cultural-experimental style. But nonetheless, uhm, this, ah, approach of asking a lot of personal questions and trying to show empathy for the client's experiences, trying to illicit feelings from the client, that this facilitative communication style was the least effective. I think it would be better to say that Indian clients would prefer, ah, to share with you what they want to say when they're ready. So if you can sort of hold back, uhm, and be open to that, the clients will eventually let you in on what they need to, what you need to know. Another line of research, that, ah, that people are often interested in is how important is it for the counselor to be, uhm, an Indian person in order to be effective in working with, with Indian clients. And, ah, Dr. Sandra Bennett and Wayne Rowe have done a series of studies across different age groups. Uhm, adolescents, ah, college students and adult clients and their, their work seems to suggest that the developmental level and gender of the client may, uhm, ah, affect this preference for counselors. If, ah, with young Indian women, ah, it's very important for them to have a female Indian counselor. Ah, the, uhm, ethnicity is important for males but not the gender, ah, among young people. As these people grow older and maybe become less consumed with issues of developing their identity that might include their Indianess, ah, there's a decrease need for the counselor being an Indian person. Then the, it's important that the person have experienced some similar life events. At the college level, uhm, these preferences, ah, are, are practical, uhm, and they are, it's more important as far as Indian college students are concerned that the counselor not necessarily be Indian, but that they have similar attitudes and values, uhm, ah, as the client. And then I add, an adult level even, ah, even more pragmatic approach might be taken. And, uhm, adult Indian people would prefer that the counselor be an older person who is more educated than they are. Certainly, another area that's important in the initial stages of forming a relationship beyond, you know, the, who the counselor is and who the counselor is in terms of their ethnicity in presenting themselves is uhm, the attitudes, their attitudes, uhm, in, in sort of their way of, of managing, helping is under scrutiny as the person is trying to decide whether they can trust you or not. Ah, it's very important then to be, to display flexibility, ah, support, goodwill, a sense of who you are, certainly, ah, you must be, you know, self-aware and, and a lot this can, can be helpful in forming the therapeutic alliance. 

00:59:40
Time considerations 

00:59:40
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE A lot has been written about Indian time and, uhm, a lot of jokes about Indian people being late. But, uhm, basically what we're talking about, we're talking about from an Indian perspective, the, the Indian time is when the time is right. Uhm, so the way this place is, or may play itself out in therapy is, uhm, client's asking for a longer period of time for session, extended, ah, sessions, uhm, might be last minute rescheduling of appointments. I know once Carolyn Attneave was talking about how may be, ah, families might switch times. All of a sudden, you're seeing a different family because, you know, they could, you know, they couldn't make it in at that time, et cetera. But it's flexibility about that. Uhm, Dell writes about, uhm, an, an article about, you know, Hopi world views, about how there is no word for time in the Hopi language, and that, ah, time is really, uhm, ah, this idea of, an experience of becoming later. It's a very subjective experience. And I think these things need to be taken into consideration because so often, ah, a lot of the work on feminist therapy is being applied to working with ethnic minorities and, ah, part of, ah, the emphasis in some of, ah, feminist writings is about maintaining boundaries and certainly being assertive about time management. And this is very, very different than, than what we were talking about. Certainly, again the time issue comes across in terms of goal-attainment, uhm- 

01:01:15
Attitudes toward goals 

01:01:15
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - it'll be good to relax standards about the accomplishments of certain goals. I mean, when there's a sense of transcendence and certainly connection with, uhm, generations, ah, uhm, beyond the earthly realm, uhm, the idea that a person may not accomplish a goal may not be so necessary. I mean, if, if you can't, if you in therapy don't accomplish this goal that you've set out, there's a sense of, uhm, emergence that someone else can come, you know, come along and accomplish this goal that needs to be done and it doesn't have to be necessarily be done by you. In counseling, we practice structuring statements, ah, to make sure that we have a mutual understanding about what is to go on in counseling. The role of a counselor, what's to happen, ah, may be that we have a mutual agreement about what are reasonable goals as I had mentioned. Uhm, maybe the timing of, of reaching those goals, et cetera. As we have, structuring is, you know, to get a share at understanding of the counseling process. Uhm, and I think another aspect of structuring that would be important in working with Indian clients, especially those from more traditional tribes, is this idea of, uhm, events. Uhm, instead of, uhm, marking period, like milestones or periods of timing one life, one's life as, ah, having a very fixed, ah, beginning and end, uhm, some tribes think about they have what would be called, uhm, Omie Baldwin has coined the word eventing. Okay, it's an idea that things don't just happen and end but there's a continuous flow of events that, ah, people have number of ongoing interactions with one another. Uhm, certainly, if you were trying to decide whether a child is getting better, it might be if he's beginning to, uhm, maybe, ah, even act out more, then people would see well, that he's preparing to be, get better because he's acting out now. So it isn't so important that well, he should have reached this stage, uhm, you know, a certain accomplishment or, or be, behaving differently. So it's the sort of continuous flow of events, this is ongoing. Now, the way that this can be applied to therapy is the kind of open invitation that a counselor can extend to revisit any issue at any time. Ah, not to be so concerned about whether this is finished or unfinished business but, ah, being open to revisiting issues and, and coming back to them again because it's sort of, uhm, free association about concerns rather than going from one topic to another. Ah, certainly this can be, uhm, applied in terms of the on, looking at the ongoing nature of helping where, ah, follow-up visits and kind of keeping it open door policy, uhm, comes into play. And then, ah, finally- 

01:04:20
Termination 

01:04:20
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE - when we think about termination in counseling, we, uhm, think that a successful termination is a very smooth transition towards the end of therapy, uhm, in which we are helping clients anticipate what is gonna be like once they leave therapy, uhm, get over any anxieties that they have about ending therapy, ah, feeling comfortable saying goodbye. Uhm, and I think this has, ah, this idea of eventing may have something to do with it. Ah, another thing too is given the amount of losses, the incredible number of losses in the Indian community, it's very, very difficult to, uhm, ah, to say goodbye, I mean, losing that relationship as another lose. And I know, ah, certainly in, in some writings about, uhm, ah, survivors of, of sexual abuse, child sexual abuse, it's been recommended by Edwards that, ah, this period of termination be extended maybe three-fold, that there's a much longer period of time to plan for the impending ending of therapy. Uhm, again, the door can always remain open. And this, this, ah, helping relationship or just this important relationship between the counselor and client is often continued beyond therapy in terms of invitations that, uhm, a client might extend for important, important community or family functions such as, uhm, a wedding or, uhm, a graduation feast, et cetera. Uhm, and when those events occur, ah, the therapist might be honored in some way. They may be given a gift, often they are, as a sign of gratitude or respect for how you have helped the client. I think it's important that, ah, we should feel comfortable accepting this generosity and that we should, you know, receive the gift without awkwardness and realize that this is just a special case for ethical practice and certainly not to feel, ah, that we cannot accept this, this, uhm, this generosity on the part of our client. 

01:06:30
CONCLUDING STATEMENTS 

01:06:30
DR. TERESA LAFROMBOISE  Hopefully, this review of the, ah, various assumptions that Indians and psychologists have about one another and the review of how this might be influenced in the counseling process will help, uhm, with your sensitivity in doing multicultural work, uhm, with Indian people as well as some other clients. Certainly, you can see that there are many gifts and burdens of tribal cultures. Certainly, the gift of the importance of spirituality and the, ah, respect for the oral tradition and respect for the power of the spoken word, this is the medium, ah, you know, that we use in, in counseling, it can be very, ah, enlightening uhm, as well our understanding of the burdens that cultures have, tribal cultures have in terms of the amount of grief and ongoing hardship and the, ah, impact of cultural genocide through many generations and, and just the general hardships of, of Indian life, you know, are challenging in our work with, with clans uhm, and they certainly challenge us to be flexible and to begin to work in very non-threatening ways so that the relationship can be formed in the therapeutic alliance made. And once that happens, then I think, you know, it can be, ah, exciting about the work that can be done in therapy in working with Indian clients. Ah, well, I thank you for your attention today and I'm, uhm, I'm excited about the work that you might be doing to help improve Indian life.
