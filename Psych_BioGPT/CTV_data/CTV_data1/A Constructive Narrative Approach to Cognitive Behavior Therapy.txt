DONALD MEICHENBAUM Well, welcome and thank you for your attendance and interest. My name is Don Meichenbaum and this is a clinical demonstration of the therapy process and the attempt to implement core skills that I presented yesterday in the, ah, keynote address. Ah, we have a volunteer, Matt, who play the role of a patient. Um, uh before we begin, let me just preface this by saying that if you go to the Brief Therapy Conference, you’ll see I’ve listed various places where I do long-term training. So I actually do uh weeklong trainings in Cape Cod or county, Santa Fe and the like. And at each of those, I show video tapes of real patients and we process that material and I will note for you uh that they now have for sale two tapes that of those that I made, one of called Mixed Anxiety Depression and the other is a Cognitive Behavior Therapy and each of those have running commentaries. The one on depression actually looks at a client over 12 sessions. So you can get a sampling of that process and I’ve also made a film recently, a very interesting one, for the American Psychological Association in Three Approaches and the like. It is actually my preference to show real-life patients and processes. But they would like a live demo. Now, the other thing is I’m going to refer to a number of therapy procedures that are also spelled out more on the clinical handbook that’s available. Now, you need to know that I absolutely, absolutely love doing psychotherapy and counseling. I mean it’s one of my favorite activities and part of the reason I love it so much is I love the way I think about cases. I’m totally enamored with my head, okay. I mean you may not like it, but I’m having one hell of a field day, okay. So the way to convey what’s going on in my head is I’m going to interview Matt and at various points, I’m going to put him on pause and I’m going to talk to the audience, that’s you, to talk about if you were in my shoes, where would you go next? Okay. Wha-wha-what information do you have? I supervise a lot of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and they bring in their video tapes of their sessions and we stop it and we go through what are the alternatives that should be research informed as to where you go next, whether it’s assessment, whether it’s engagement, where you are, what do you think is the unfinished business. And if we are successful, I don’t know how well we could do this within this one hour, you should be able to predict what comes out of my mouth next, not-not that you agree with it, but I will give you the rationale for how I’m going to try and work through those boxes in terms of ascertaining where you would go with this client. Obviously, this is partly getting to know the client and intake as compared to doing a specific intervention. But you’ll see that from my point of view, the most valuable tool you have is the art of questioning. In fact, I have a fetish and my fetish is I love to collect things and the thing that I love to collect more than anything in the world, it shows you something about my what personality is I love to collect good clinical questions. So I read everyone’s menu. I don’t care what you call yourself, okay. I don’t know, solution focused, systemic and every once in a while, I come across something I go, ooo, that is very good, that is a terrific question. And I suck ‘em up like a vacuum cleaner, okay. And-and I have the best question that you could ask to get a therapeutic alliance, risk taking, and so forth. And if you go to the handbook, you’d be a recipient of that kind of process. So without further ado, I’d like to turn our attention to Matt’s story and I want you to become an exquisite listener to how people tell stories, okay, because I think that what goes on in therapy is collaborative storytelling, that my job is to help him develop a more hopeful, helpful story, I want him to appreciate what he’s been able to achieve in spite of and moreover, I want to make sure he has the skills to actually implement that and then when he actually makes improvement that he takes credit for it. So we’re going to work through those various kinds of core tasks. So let me begin by thanking you for coming here today, Matt, and I wondered if we could begin if you may to tell me what it is that brings you here at this point? 

00:05:45
MATT Well, uh, I’ve suffered from depression on and off since I was about 17 years old and uh about two years ago, I was diagnosed with Type I diabetes and since then, the depression has gotten a bit worse and uh so I’m just looking for solutions to that. 

00:06:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Can you tell me a little bit about the depression is, what it is that you’re --? 

00:06:15
MATT Sometimes, it feels like, um, I just get down on myself or uh hopeless, I guess. I think about the future and I feel like um nothing good could possibly happen or uh I’ll think about something that I want uh or need and feel like there is no way I’ll be able to attain that. uh And sometimes, that makes me angry at myself, um, and it just makes me sad. 

00:06:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Could you just put on pause? Interesting option. If you were in my shoes, what are you going to go for next? Are you going for the level of the depression that he’s immediately presenting? He also indicated the issue of anger. Are you going for the diabetes that kicked in and how that’s contributing and how he’s handling it. Are you going to go for the fact that he had depression when he started at 17 years of age? Right. I mean all therapies really fascinate because you’ve got choice points. So the key question is if you’re in my shoes, what are you going to go for next in terms of the concern that you have here? So my concern is to go for the nature of the depression. Okay. Because I want to see that he has no sense of the future and so forth and one of the concerns I always have with regard to depression has to do with the potential of suicidal risk, okay. Then, it becomes very interesting depending upon when I get there, whether I go for the diabetes or whether you go for developmental features of 17, okay. So one of the things we know about adults is that they really, really if ever have the onset of depression as an adult. Almost all depression starts during adolescence and so forth. So we could start to think about what went on there and what he was able to achieve in spite of. So, ya know, I’m sitting here, okay, trying to be as compassionate, nonjudgmental, interactive as possible, but in my head are a number of choice points. So as you’re sitting here watching this, I really want you to be actively engaged. You may agree with where I go or not, but you could see that in my mind, and you’re going to see them by the time I come out of therapy, I’m really tired, because I’m attending to every single word that they’re saying, but I’m also having all of this other stuff. If you don’t do this in your head, you should go find another job, okay, because this is the fun of therapy because you’re being like a detective. You mentioned something about things you would want and not feeling that you’re able to achieve this. Can-can you tell me a little bit about some of the things that you --? 

00:08:55
MATT Um, career, family, um, you know wanting to have a successful career, doing something that I love and just feeling like I’m – I don’t have the talent or the circumstances to do that. Um, wanting to raise a family with a feeling like I wouldn’t be a good father, I wouldn’t be able to provide for my family um -- 

00:09:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM No, no, you mentioned something about career, family, having kids, on the one hand; and on the other hand, some concern about whether you’re – you have the ability to-to achieve all that. Is that sort of the issue therein. 

00:09:45
MATT Yeah, yeah, it’s whether – sort of twofold, whether on the one hand, um, will the circumstances around me allow it to happen, am I uh going to be able to find the resources I need and secondly, um, am I even capable of doing what it takes? 

00:10:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And, of-of-of those you mentioned, I was kind of curious and you said something about a career, wha-what do you have in mind there, what kinds of things do you --? 

00:10:15
MATT Uh, Well, I-I –Um I’m a musician and I would like to be a professional musician, ah, but I feel like that’s unrealistic, it’s difficult to make money and um, it’s-it's not a very stable career. Ah, and there are I-I think other options maybe if I could get a more advanced degree, I could teach. 

00:10:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Wha-what kind of musician are you? 

00:10:45
MATT I play several different instruments- 

00:10:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:10:45
MATT and I guess I consider myself more of a songwriter, a recording artist rather than the particular instrumentalist. 

00:10:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Pause. So this is an interesting issue. The question is am I going to pursue the issue of depression and all the symptomatology and the thinking processes or am I going to put in our assessment here going for the strength which has to do with the career, okay, and the fact that he is a musicians, he plays several instruments and so forth. So the interesting question is in terms of developing a therapeutic alliance, how much do you want to go for the psychopathology? I mean there is going to be plenty of time to go for the nature of the depression, the severity, okay, and the developmental history of that. If I go for all of that pathology, all of the negative things right at the beginning, okay, and especially if he’s seen other therapists or he’s been hospitalized, he is told that first timeline a great deal. So I want to at least plant the seed that I’m interested in the rest of the story as well. So the interesting thing is here’s a choice point of you as a therapist. I mean do you go for the depression? I mean he is giving you all of the cognitive features. I mean do you go to see how the depression shows up in terms of loss of weight, sleeplessness, suicidal ideation, or do you plug within this flow of the social discourse the possibility of a career? Okay. So if he writes songs, that for me is Box Six, that’s red things, right? Because he -- I mean what are most songs about? Depression, right? He’s a professional in doing that, right? He could write Country/Western for the rest of his life, right? She left my heart, you know. I mean this – I mean- I mean he can go to Nashville, right, and be a hit and use his own experiences, right? I mean who – I mean people who are happy don’t make good songwriters, right? So in the back of my mind is holy several instruments, what the hell you – I tried to play the piano, I couldn’t even get through one thing, I can’t carry it. I’m impressed. I have the reason to be depressed, not you. okay. I’m – so that’s all go into my head, right? And the whole idea is I’m filtering out what I’m going to say to him and all I’m going to do is pluck. Now, watch how my times I ask questions and never finished the sentence. Before managed care, I used to use whole sentences. When managed care, I only use open-ended sentences, okay? And if things keep going badly, I’m only going to use hmms, hmm, hmm, hmm, next- hmm, hmm. No, but put yourself in my shoes. Where would you go? Okay. Are you going to go for his depression? Are you going to go for the developmental history? Are you going to go for the career? Okay. Not only that, in the back of your mind, you’ve got diabetes, okay. So the key question is does he have diabetes I which is long term, or does he have diabetes II? Not only that, we know that having diabetes can affect and not only that, there is a great deal of demand. I did a whole bunch of research on diabetics. So one of the things that becomes interesting is I need to go for diabetics. Now, to be an effective diabetic, he has to monitor glucose, he has to control diet, he has to do exercise, he has to do examining foot care, okay. He has to be able to go for regular monitoring. So he has if we go to diabetes, a whole bunch of skills in his repertoire. The key question is, is there anything that he’s doing in diabetes that we can now apply in the area of diabet– in the area of depression. So diabetes is not only a comorbid feature, but when I go for the diabetes, I’m looking for all of the controlling aspects that he has in regulating it. So if he could regulate diabetes, glucose monitoring, Columbo needs to know, is there anything that you could do with regard to the depression to become that musician? I don’t know. Okay. So one of the things that you mentioned, and I’m impressed, several instruments and so forth. Ho-how do you ever develop that kind of skill? I mean -- 

00:15:00
MATT Ah..Well, my father was a guitar player, a really good guitar player and uh he was a great influence on me growing up. He introduced me to a lot of different styles of music and I kind of grew from there and developed an interest in different umm sounds and just started exploring those different sounds and I-I found that I had sort of a knack for learning uh instruments. 

00:15:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So there was your dad. Who else was there as you were growing up? 

00:15:35
MATT Ah, when I was in high school, I lived across the street from another boy about my age who played drums and I used to take my guitar, I have an electric guitar and an amplifier and I took that over to his house and-and we would just play music every day. 

00:15:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So-so you mentioned that your dad had a real say influence? 

00:15:55
MATT Yeah. 

00:16:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Te-te-tell me a little bit about that, what -- 

00:16:00
MATT He, I think, kind of crossed the gap between generations. He liked music from before his time going back to jazz from the ‘20s through the ‘40s and um that was music that my grandmother played. She was actually a – I suppose an influence too. When I was very small, I used to hear her play piano, she played ragtime piano at bars and things. And so I heard that from her and then I heard some of the jazz from my dad growing up. 

00:16:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM An-an-and was your mom there too, what was that all like? 

00:16:40
MATT Uh, she was there. She uh was not particularly musical. She liked music, but it was not a major force in her life. 

00:16:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And did your dad have influences in other ways? Was he there the whole time or --? 

00:16:55
MATT Um, I-I guess negatively, he-he was very angry person, he had a lot of rage- 

00:17:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:17:00
MATT  and um he wasn’t um, physically abusive, but he would, you know, throw things and punch holes in the wall and things like that and I-I find myself reliving those behaviors as an adult and also um, when I was ah 10 years old he left me and my mother 

00:17:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:17:30
MATT and then she kind of struggled to raise me from that point on. 

00:17:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Pause. So obviously, I’m interested in developmental history, right, ‘cos one of the things we know is that depression is intergenerationally transmitted or that victimization contributes to it. So instead of me turning to him and say, now that we’ve covered your current situation, could you please share with me the developmental history that might have contributed to the nature of your depression, right? I mean that’s essentially what I want to know, right. So instead, he plays multiple instruments. How do you get a developmental history? You go through th-the how did he learn that music, right, because he’s got to tell you a story, okay. So one of the things that becomes really interesting is who does he tell his story about. He tells the story about his father, he tells the story about his grandmother, where is mom, where are siblings. Okay. So by the omission of what he’s including, you become curious. Now, you have some really interesting issues. Okay. The father has a lot of problems with rage. He’s re-experiencing those kinds of events. Not only that, he has a sense of abandonment, the guys who is teaching him music takes off. So from my point of view, it’s not that bad things happen to people. Bad happens to lots of people, okay. I talked about this yesterday in terms of victimization experiences, dysfunctional families, the key for me is what is it that he takes away from that experience, what lingers from that, what conclusions does he draw from that, okay? So my concern is in dealing with the depression and remember what was the other key word he said. Not only depression, he also says he gets angry, okay. So what is it that triggers his anger and what’s going to go on there? So I mean it’s kind of interesting. You’re in my shoes, okay. We’re learning a lot about this guy’s life within a very short period of time using his initial story as a jumping off point to get at this material. So if they give you an opening like the music, how do you learn multiple instruments, okay. Well, my find was someone had to teach you to become that kind of expertise . Okay. So-so you said wha-what was it, at age 11? 

00:19:45
MATT Uh. Around that age, I don’t remember specifically, yes. 

00:19:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So he-he took off. Could you – do you recall what were sort of the circumstances that can –? 

00:19:55
MATT He was having a really hard time with the new job. We had just moved to a new area and uh, he was – he didn’t get along with his boss and uh, so he was feeling very stressed out all the time and uh, it was also we were in um Buffalo, New York, ah which is really overcast and cloudy a lot and he would complain about that all the time. I think that-that didn’t help. And so he-he just seemed to get more and more distant, he would come home and just drink and watch football and I couldn’t get a response. I remember trying to talk to him and he would just sort of grunt. 

00:20:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And when he took off, did he come back at all or did he --? 

00:20:40
MATT Eventually, after a few years of uh living with my mother, I uh– I missed my dad and I talked about it all the time, how I wanted to see him and my mom said, okay, well, um, let’s go – let’s go find him, essentially. He had moved out to live with my aunt in umm Phoenix, Arizona. And so uh my mom eventually moved us to Mesa, Arizona which is just ah 10 or 15 miles away and -- 

00:21:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Pause. Interesting. What did you just hear? You heard emotion as he told the story, tears are welling up in his eyes. So this is a very interesting choice point. Do I want to stay with the feelings that he’s now sharing about the story or do I want to ask him the questions about how he felt when the hus– when his dad left, how he felt when he reached out and he couldn’t connect? So my sense, okay, this is a choice point, right? I’m sitting here and saying, Don, should you go for what it was like or do you go for the fact that his eyes are welling up, that his voice just cracked and stay with the immediate emotion right here, okay? And my sense is to always stay with the present, okay, and then to see where that came from. So as you tell me about your dad, about his being withdrawn, about him coming home and watching TV, of your reaching out, of him drinking a lot, of him punching the wall, so not only am I going to do this, but I summarized everything that he’s told me, right. I want my client to know that I have heard every single word that they said. So I’m going to do an intermittent summary and sched(ph) acknowledgement, my – is that what happened? 

00:22:50
MATT Yeah. 

00:22:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now, as you tell me this, I noticed something and I wondered if you noticed it too. There was a kind of furiness(ph), a kind of – how did you feel in sharing that right now? 

00:23:15
MATT It’s hard, it’s hard to talk about. Uh.. There is definitely, um, you know, a lot of sadness and a lot of pain came from that. 

00:23:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And the pain is still there now? 

00:23:30
MATT Ah, yeah, yeah, it has and I think I’m more aware of it now. I think um, I remember for the first few years after that happened, um, I didn’t feel anything. I felt like I’m supposed to be sad, I’m supposed to be depressed and there was just nothing there. And as I’ve gotten older, um, I’ve just started to feel that more and more as I remember those things. 

00:24:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM What do you think lingers from that kind of experience that you had? What stays with you on? 

00:24:15
MATT  That’s hard to say. I mean explicitly, uh, the idea that- I-I that it’s people get angry that they have a hard time with life and that sometimes, they don’t handle that well. Um, and I think more implicitly, I learned that when uh, you get angry, you punch the wall, you know. 

00:24:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You mentioned before that sometimes, you get angry. Can you tell me a little bit about that when --? 

00:24:55
MATT Um, well, it seems like sometimes, I am more susceptible to it than others- 

00:25:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:25:00
MATT  and if I’m in a certain mood, ah, and these moods can last for – for anywhere from a few hours to a few days, sometimes a week, um, and in that mood, on the slightest thing will set me off. I’ll , you know, spill a drink or ah, the car will break or – or even just the smallest delay on the waiting for the Internet to download something, anything little as minor inconveniences and I just explode. 

00:25:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And how-how does that making you explode? 

00:25:40
MATT Yeah. 

00:25:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And if I was there, what would I see, what – what’s the nature of that? 

00:25:45
MATT Well, uh currently, I’ve been trying to find more healthy ways to deal with it. So I’ve started just doing exercises or if I feel that anger welling up, you’ll see it on my face, you see me get angry, probably turn red, but then I, um, you know, would just start doing pushups or sit-ups or something like that or take a walk. 

00:26:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So-s there are ways that you’re trying to – 

00:26:10
MATT (crosstalk) there are ways that I'm coping with it- 

00:26:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm.(crosstalk) 

00:26:10
MATT -But that’s been very recent. Up until that, I’ve been -- 

00:26:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm. So how did you come to the – the notion that you were able to help yourself with the anger by doing pushups or redirecting or how did – how did that all come about? 

00:26:20
MATT Well, I’ve be-I've been committed to change. For the last two years, I’ve been working really hard to deal with my emotions in a more constructive way and I noticed as I observed my emotions that that anger is it’s a physical feeling. I-I-I need to hit something, I need to hurt something or someone is-is this urge that I feel and if I can express physical, if I can output that energy somehow, um, if I can, that’s I have to. I just have to. I have to get that energy out of my body and if – uh it’s either going to come out by me breaking something or me doing pushups. 

00:27:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Here is a – here is a somewhat different but important question. Has there ever been an occasion when you’ve gotten angry at yourself that you would ever consider hurting yourself or have done that kind of –? 

00:27:30
MATT Yeah. Yeah. I mean I’ve definitely gotten mad at things that I’ve said. I look back on just stupid things I’ve said or done, um, or-or situations that I’ve been in, that I didn’t handle well. Um, and that kind of combined with those feelings of the future and the hopelessness and everything, uh, yeah, I’ve thought about, um I mean I’ve-I've hit myself before um, and I’ve thought about hurting myself. 

00:28:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Pause. Okay, now, I think whenever you have a client who is depressed, okay, there is a mandate for you to do suicide assessment. If you go to The Melissa Institute, I have an 85-page handout there on how to do suicide assessment and you could download it. So one of the things that becomes very interesting is he has a number of factors that put him in high risk. The other factor that we need to explore is the use of substances, right, ‘cos his father had been using substances. So we’re going to increase the risk if this – if this young man is also using alcohol or other kinds of substances, especially during periods of depression, that would put him in high risk. Not only that, I’m ac– and then, I’m sort of testing for that kind of process. So I have a lot of things that are still in my head that are part of the agenda here, right, ‘cos we have the whole business of now going for the suicide assessment. We have – you could see that he talked about – I – he told me how he coped with the anger in developing these kinds of techniques. I also need to know whether he’s receiving any treatment or whether he’s on medication now. So-so I have a whole backlog and obviously, I’m not going to get to all of those issues in this one hour. So I think it’s really important that you write progress notes on what it is that you get and then what is it that you need to pursue later on. The most immediate kind of concern that you should have as an expert therapist is safety planning. So I want to know what the hell is going on on this – you got to make sure this guy is going to come back, okay, 'cause if you think he's suicidal risk, he’s got to get your num– there’s a whole checklist I put on safety planning. So I have a lot of other agenda items that I want to explore with this guy in terms of the strength of music and all that kind of thing but now, what comes up is a red flag that says, Meichenbaum, go for the notion that he may be potentially suicidal, okay. And you got to make sure that you don’t avoid using the word, kill yourself, or suicide, okay. So hurt yourself is very ambiguous in terms of what’s going on here. So you want to make sure that depression doesn’t win and he loses as a result of that. So what I’m going to do now is go for a number of risk factors. So I need to have in my head risk and protective factors. Not only that, the other thing that’s really important is I need to document this in a systematic way. The data indicates that in 25% of the cases where clients commit suicide, the therapist is going to be sued by the family, right. This is – this is a very high risk kind of arena. So if this guy goes out and kills himself, okay, you can’t add notes afterwards, you need to say, I assessed for, these were the questions I asked. This was the documentation, this is the safety plan he left with, okay, because the cross-examiner is going to say, Dr. Meichenbaum, did Matt in any time indicate his level of depression? Did he comment on the suicide – did you systematically assess for that? Did you document that? Did you include the suicide intense scale? Did you in impr-- provide 800 number? Did you give him the safety plan? If your answer is a no to those kinds of things, you’re going to be liable, okay. If you go to The Melissa Institute website, all of this is there, okay. You mentioned Matt something about, I think the word that you used was that you had been contemplating suicide. Can you tell me how far that has gone? What it is that you had thought about? 

00:31:50
MATT Um, well, prior to my um, diabetes diagnosis- 

00:31:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm.(crosstalk) 

00:31:55
MATT  It was sort of a generalized just I wish I was dead, this would all be easier if I was just dead, it would be easier to die than to deal with my problems. But um, since the diabetes, it gives me – I have a tool in my hands. 

00:32:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:32:15
MATT  And I’ve thought about to the point where I feel like, you know, I can’t take it anymore if this gets any worse, I’ll just overdose on insulin and be done with it, um. 

00:32:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Pause. What words do you think I’m going to use next? Anybody have a notion? Tools in his hand, okay, somehow, the diabetes gave him tools in his hand, okay. So this is a guy who had anger problems and who is developing coping strategies. This is a guy who is diabetes and now sees diabetes as having tools in his hand. So it becomes really interesting. Should I pluck tools for his hand? Do I let the story go on? Do I go for his substance abuse? Do I go for intent? Do I go for whether he has a gun or other kind of – so he mentioned that he can overdose on, okay. So I am sitting here saying, Don, don’t go for tools in the hand yet, okay. Don’t interrupt the flow of the story, get it out to see how much more risk factors there are, protective factors. For instance, has he shared, has he gone to anything? So I – and then, in the back of my hand, I can always call up tools in my hand and how that gets into diabetes. I mean, this is why I love doing psychotherapy, right. I mean you’re seeing, then he go, Don, go for the tools in the hand, No-no don’t go for the tools in the hand, okay, it’s too early, okay. Get the story out, go for the risk assessment. Go for the risk assessment, get the protective factors. Now that you can go get protective factors, no, no, go for the – oh! My god, he got the whole thing with the developmental history is the father still in the scene or not, okay. Not only that, this guy is going to write music about this entire session. Okay, he is going to write the number one song on how therapy helped me turn depression around. It’s like kicking the football through the goal of god, okay. I mean, this is all Country/Western, okay. So I want to hold out the carrot that he is going to make me famous as a therapist in some song, right. 

00:34:20
[sil.] 

00:34:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I'm concerned about the depressions, about your notions a couple of years ago of thinking about hurting yourself of overdosing. And I want to make sure that as we were together that the depression which colors the way you see things doesn’t take over. Can you tell me a little bit more about that notion about hurting yourself and the whole business of – are you – let me just ask a couple of questions- are-are you using any substances like alcohol or drugs or anything like that, like your dad did? 

00:35:25
MATT Um, not regularly. Ah, I will drink occasionally. Ah, probably – 

00:35:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM What do you drink and how much? 

00:35:35
MATT  Um, every –uh I would say every few weeks, maybe I’ll go out for beers, I’ll have five or six beers, sometimes you know, less, that’s about the most. Looking back, that’s probably too much. 

00:35:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yeah, I mean, one of the things that might be of interest to you because I know you’re into computers and so forth, you mentioned, is that you can go online and there is actually a thing called a Drinkers Check-up and you can actually assess how much you’re drinking compared to other people. Whether it’s just once a while, whether you’re bingeing and we can actually talk about that, it’s a private kind of measure. And you can actually go through that and figure out whether – you see one of the things that gets concerned is when the substance abuse increases the likelihood. Now, you mentioned that you thought about this. Is there a gun available in the house or just drugs or –? 

00:36:40
MATT No, I’ve avoided owning a gun specifically for this reason. 

00:36:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So you could see that as a kind of important. Okay. So, let me put it on pause. So what I’m going to do, just for demonstration purposes, is I would pursue this business of the suicide alley and depression and make sure it’s not a risk factor. I would like to demonstrate, okay, because this is out of sequence two other procedures before we break, one has to do with how do you use the clock metaphor that I talked about yesterday. And the second is how to get at box six which is the strengths, okay. So, this is not something I would do in this first session. But for demonstration purposes, I am going – so-so, let’s take a look at this anger that you’re experiencing, okay. And you said that there were a number of things that sort of set you off, let me see what it was, the computer going down, spilling something, okay, and that-and that are there other things that sort of trigger? 

00:37:45
MATT Ah, relationship issues. 

00:37:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm. Like tell me a little bit about those relationships? What kinds of relationship issues might? 

00:37:55
MATT Just fights with my girlfriend. I am pretty standard stuff, I can’t even remember what we fight about. Um, it just seems like pretty normal relationship fights. 

00:38:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Can you give me an example of the last fight you had? 

00:38:10
MATT  Um, well, I am having a hard time remembering the content. 

00:38:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

00:38:20
MATT Um- 

00:38:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM What was it over? Where did it occur? 

00:38:25
MATT  A few days ago, um – it – it happens a lot actually because of like my domineer or my mood. She’ll say, you know, why are you being like this? 

00:38:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm. 

00:38:45
MATT And I feel like being like what? I don’t – I don’t know what you’re talking about. 

00:38:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And when she says that, why are you being like this, okay, how does that make you feel? 

00:38:55
MATT  Ah, it’s frustrating. 

00:39:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm. 

00:39:00
MATT  I – I don’t feel like my internal, ah, state is up for criticism. I feel the way I feel. I’m in whatever mood (crosstalk). 

00:39:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And besides frustrated, are there any other feelings that you have? 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:25
MATT Anger, you know, anger, confusion, anger at her for attacking me for what I perceive as no reason. 

00:39:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, she says, why are you like that and you feel frustrated, angry, confused. And you have the thought of what – what kinds of thoughts if any? 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:50
MATT Ah, it used to be, I hate her, I hate the situation, I should get out of this relationship. Ah, lately it’s more, I need to just get – I just need to get out for a little while and maybe take a walk. I need to cool off, I need to let her cool off – 

00:40:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And when you have – and when you have those kinds of feelings and thoughts, what do you do? 

00:40:20
MATT Um. Most of the time, I – I just – If I can, I try to – I try to just calm myself and use reason to assess out the real problem and deal with it. That’s not always successful. And in those cases, I try to get out of the area- 

00:40:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
MATT -and go for a walk or something. And um, you know- 

00:40:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM An-and when you- (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
MATT -at worst, I shout, I shout about it. 

00:40:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, if you shout and you withdraw, how does she respond to that? 

00:40:55
MATT  Um, it’s like everything is in escalation, you know. She gets mad at me because I am acting weird or whatever. And then, I get mad that she is mad at me and then she gets mad that I am mad and back and forth. 

00:41:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So let me see If I understand what transpires here. And correct me if I am wrong, okay. So, a number of things set you off. Sometimes, they are like the computer is smoking(ph), but a lot of them have to do with the relationship. So for instance, when your girlfriend says, why are you acting like that? And that leads you to become angry, confused, and you have the thought of, I hate this, I mean, who do she think she is, she doesn’t understand me, I got to get out of here. And then, one of the things you might do is, you might shout, you might withdraw, you might try and even reason with yourself to find out what’s going on. I mean, it sounds to me, Matt, and correct me if I am wrong, that it’s just the kind of – how shall I put it, it’s kind of a vicious – 

00:42:00
MATT  Vicious cycle, yeah. 

00:42:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  A vicious cycle. Let’s take a moment to talk about that vicious cycle. So, I essentially put on pause, I am running out of time, but what I am trying to advocate is that any client story that they tell you can be broken into those four components. There is no – and if you don’t want to try it with your client, try this with your spouse. You know, when you take that tone of voice with me in front of other people, it makes me feel, okay. And I have the thought that I knew how to drive before we got married, I know how to drive once more again, okay. And if you do this on a continuing basis, right, it just sounds to us that we’re in a vicious and they say to you, you go to one more conference, one more workshop and our relationship is over. This is a very – there is absolutely no one story that cannot be broken up into these components that you could do the vicious cycle, okay. And when he does that vicious cycle, I can now if we had more time say, what is the impact? What is the toll? What is the price? Not only that, he has other vicious cycles, right. He had the whole vicious cycle about when he gets angry at himself and how does he break it? He uses exercise and distraction, okay. So, the key question is, when he gets depressed, is there anything he is using in this area that we can now -- so what I am going to do is encourage him not to change a thing, especially with his girlfriend, okay. And note that when I get to 9 o’clock, I am going for the sequence and he tells me it escalates. Now, what’s really interesting is, if you watch me, let’s say that this was a family or couples, you can now see that what I do in therapy is, oh! Look at that, he is going for the son’s 12 o’clock and now he is going for the father’s 3 o’clock, nicely done, Don. Now, we just went into the son’s perception of the father’s 3 o’clock, oh, he is now going for the mother’s 6 o’clock, you could choreograph everything that I do using the clock, okay. So what happens is you want to convey that people’s depression that this kid had when his father left was adaptive. He should feel depressed, okay. In fact, I am going to commend him that the fact that he is in tune with those feelings is going to make him a great music writer, okay. I would be deeply, deeply concerned if the one person who he looked up to influenced, who abandoned them for three years. And if this kid doesn’t get depressed, we got to look for a loony bin. That is where we really need – the fact that he is depressed shows me how sensitive he is. And the key question is, tell me about a songwriter who you admire, okay. I am going to – I am going to have a whole session on having him bring in his poetry and song writing, okay. And how he transforms his pain into something good that could come of it. And you know, one of those things about those songwriters because I just listened to Garth Brooks last night. I listened to the whole interview of Garth Brooks, right. He told he was nebbish, he told he couldn’t write a god damn song. We would watch the Larry King segment that Garth Brooks says, you know, there are lots of people out there who are better musicians than me. You know, I fake it on the guitar. Now, do you know how much he is getting paid by Wynn at the Vegas for a guy who is a nebbish. Okay. So I mean, so this guy has got to know that he has a whole variety of coping skills in his repertoire. So it would be absolutely a delight to work with Matt and other patients, okay. And -- and from my point of view, what you’re seeing here is not cognitive behavior therapy or interpersonal therapy, it’s just good therapy, or as good as I could try and be. And what makes me as good as possible is I am going to ask, Matt, as I am going to do now, Matt, is there anything I said or did or anything I failed to say or do that you found particularly helpful or unhelpful given this short exchange was there and what’s your take on what just transpired? 

00:46:30
MATT  I feel like, um, I have a better perspectives on myself. I feel like the questions that you asked sort of highlighted some connections. And it didn’t even seem intentional necessarily, but just some of the things that I found myself saying seemed to uhh, make more sense now. Um, I wish I could be more specific. 

00:47:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM All right, no, that’s very helpful. Uh, I would like the audience to join me in thanking you for your participation. 

00:47:15
MATT Thank you. 

00:47:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  Thank you very much. Thank you, all. I have ten more minutes? 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:47:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Really? 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:47:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, let’s get back to – I-I-I am sorry, I misjudged. Um, would it be – I mean I can continue on in this way or I would be more than happy to take some questions for the last few minutes or this is a golden opportunity because all of a sudden, I have 100 supervisors who are going to tell me how the session should have been conducted. So I am more than happy to see if there are any pressing questions or comments that people have. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN  Can you continue? 

00:48:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:48:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM All right. Um, you mentioned that you play multiple instruments and ah, do song writing and that one of your notions, see if I picked up on this, is to become a songwriter. Tell me about, a little bit about that process. 

00:48:40
MATT  It usually starts with, um, a melody or a line of lyrics that I just kind of – it just kind of comes to me. And uh, I guess I kind of hear random melodies and word combinations all the time and when one sticks out that I like, I grab it and I try to develop it further into a song. 

00:49:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hmm. 

00:49:10
MATT And, um, I listen to it and I basically – ah, I take whatever piece of a song I start with and I just listen to it and I ask myself what does this need and I try to just add what it needs. And sometimes, it just needs an acoustic guitar; sometimes, it needs a full band and – 

00:49:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  So there is a part of you that could sort of observe the process and ask yourself questions. 

00:49:40
MATT Yes. 

00:49:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Have you written any songs like? 

00:49:40
MATT Yes, yes, I’ve written -- I have released a full-length album and an EP, a short... 

00:49:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Oh! Wow. 

00:49:50
MATT Five-song EP. 

00:49:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Really. So is there anything from your experience growing up in that home with regard to your dad and his leaving and all the things that you experienced, does that become part of your song writing material? 

00:50:10
MATT  Yeah, sometimes. Ah, there is one song in particular that I wrote called the Yes and No. 

00:50:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Called what? 

00:50:20
MATT Yes and No. 

00:50:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yes and No. 

00:50:20
MATT  And it starts out uh, with the most, the darkest, most depressed statements and imagery I can muster and a lot of minor chords and um, I tried to channel all my anger and all my depression into the first half of the song to the point where it builds to just wailing and screaming and then I just bring it all down, changed the chords, the major chords and express everything I love about the world and about myself and about music. 

00:51:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  That’s fascinating. How do you get from all of that hurt, all of that sadness, the depression, the anger, the minor chords? How do you get from there to the shift? 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:35
MATT Um, well, I guess, ah, from a -- an emotional perspective, I am pouring everything I have into the song and it just sort of, I don’t know, it just feels natural. 

00:51:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mhmm. 

00:51:55
MATT To – to once I reach this point of extreme negativity, there is almost a push back to be more positive. And from a songwriting perspective, the contrast of going from really loud to really quiet just makes for a dynamic song. So that was partly strategic and partly, um, just a way of expressing both sides of my emotional state. 

00:52:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Here is a somewhat different question. When it comes to your own depression, that what’s brought you in here to begin with, is there any kind of push back you can use with your own depression? Is there anything you’ve done in your music in how to handle the anger, of how to cope with the diabetes, the tools that were in your hand, is there any of those kinds of strengths and abilities that part of you that’s an observer that you could use with your own depression. 

00:53:15
MATT  Well, I think the um, diabetes has introduced me to self-monitoring and I think I can use the idea of just checking in on a regular basis. 

00:53:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Checking in on your moods. 

00:53:40
MATT On my moods, yea, so that I can kind of deal with them consciously. Uh. Also, I was thinking about what you – what you said, when you asked if my music could help and I was thinking of the song that we had been talking about and I realized, well, I don’t want to push my depression and build it and ruminate and make it grow like I do in the song. 

00:54:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:54:05
MATT But in the side just ask – you made me ask myself, how is it that I can indulge my depression in the song and then get better at the end whereas I am afraid in real life if I indulge my depression, it won’t get better. But in the song, I know that the happy part is coming. So I can completely let go. And um, I – it was like an epiphany that I had just now realizing that, as long as I can remember that there will be a happy part at the end or after the storm passes – 

00:54:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So – 

00:54:45
MATT  I’ll be okay. 

00:54:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM In the same way that you script the songs, the question is, Matt, can you script your life? Can you break the vicious cycle? Can you fulfill the career you want? Can you be the father to your children that your dad was not to you? I don’t know the answer to those questions, but as you’re therapist, as all working together, I would really value looking at what that journey is. I think you will make not only a good parent, but a fine musician. You have a great deal of personal experience to share with others and make a gift of. Does that make any sense? 

00:55:55
MATT Yeah. Yeah, it does. Um, I feel really hopeful right now. 

00:56:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM  Great. So, one of the things that I do is a lot of intermittent summaries and I have now collected, you know, the things he does with the anger, the things he does about breaking the cycle, about the tools in the hands with the diabetes. So the question is, he has a story to tell, and the key question is which story does he tell? Does he tell story of the abandoned youth whose father went out, that who’s been depressed, who is a diabetic, who can never achieve, or does he also tell the more hopeful story which is the rest of the story, it’s my second timeline and you can’t just sell the product of hope, it’s got to be based on something, okay. The fact that he has multiple talents, the fact that he’s written songs, the fact that he has a part of him and note, there are no parts of people, okay, this is all collaborative story tell. I hope this doesn’t come as disappointing news, but it turns out that there is no inner child, okay. Have you been counting on the inner child coming, this all – all therapy is collaborative storytelling, okay. And my job is to have this guy have a basis for more hopeful stories. It would be absolutely a delight to work with Matt and I hope that whatever I have to offer will make you a better therapist. Once again, thank you for your attention and interest. 

00:57:25
MATT Thank you. 

00:57:25
