Military Counseling Academy Counseling Returning Veterans with PTSD 

00:00:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY My name's, uh, Larry Ashley, and, uh, this is my guinea pig client, uh, who in a previous life was a student of mine, Jodi, who's, uh, a veteran and is going to be my client today and, uh, come out when I do a family session, uh, so this is totally unscripted. I ha-, have no idea whatsoever she's gonna say. 

00:00:30
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:00:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Okay, Jodi. You were requested to see me to talk about certain issues, and so this is, I guess, uh, our first session, and so, we'll let you go from, uh, from there. Anything you wanna chat about, you know it's, we talked about it being confidential, so nobody will, uh, hear anything from me. It's up to you if you wanna share with anybody, but I won't be sharing anything because we're gonna be talking about some real personal, uh, emotional-laden topics. 

00:01:10
JODI S. JOYCE So, uh, let's see, after coming back from being in the air force, I thought I'd be all right, and I thought I can just handle the day-by-day stuff, and, you know, it's what you do. It's your job. Um, you hear things, you see things, you hear noises, um, you do it on a day-to-day basis and you wake up and you do it again. But, um, when you see a friend die, it's a little tough. When you realize you were supposed to be that person in that spot, it's a little tough. Um, basically the, in the convoy in front of us, the Humvee, an IED exploded, and there was no survivors in the Humvee, and I was supposed to be in that one. I just happened to be in the one behind me, behind them. And the person in front of me ended up being burnt all the way on the left hand side. 

00:02:05
JODI S. JOYCE I hurt my neck, I hurt my back, I hurt my arm. Um, thinking these are just minor injuries, no problem, I can, I can make it through and ended up getting out and returning back to regular work and now I'm just miserable. And I have a really short temper. Um, I can't stand anybody around me. Um, I sleep with my clothes on and I, I don't even know what pajamas are because I, I feel the need, I have to, I have to be fully ready, you know, I have to be ready to go, fully clothed, so that I can get up and go. And I, I couldn't relate whether that was the military thing of being ready, kinda cheat the system, or if that was me being scared and freaked out. Um, I tried for a little bit of time to sleep at night. I don't know, remember the last time I have slept, at least more than an hour. Um, I know I can't sleep in a bed. I'm to the point where I sleep in a recliner. I have to sit up. And, um, I'm debating whether to get a gun 'cuz I have a, I got a dog. It got so bad so I got a dog that I trained the dog pretty, pretty well to protect me, military trained, cop-trained type training 'cuz I don't feel safe. I can't, I can't stand anything around me, no noises. I'm, I just, so no sleep and I can't do the work so my boss'll come by or somebody'll say something and I, I noticed this last week, I started needing headphones 'cuz just somebody talking would just totally freak me out and I, I literally would have to get up and walk away. 

00:03:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY Now when you say headphones, is that at work or at home or both? 

00:03:55
JODI S. JOYCE Both. 

00:03:55
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:04:00
LARRY L. ASHLEY Okay. Well, there's many ways we can approach this, uh, there's many treatment options that we could look at. Uh, based on reading your history a little bit and looking at it, I, that I, tell you up front, I'm a prolonged exposure therapist by choice. That doesn't mean there aren't other options. And what that basically means is, uh, we'll go into the past a little bit, and might be painful, uh, experience, but we'll, we're kinda taking the power away from what's happened. You can't change it, but obviously it's still in your, in your head, and we'll look at different types of, uh, live exercises, homework, and stuff here, and so 

00:04:40
JODI S. JOYCE So that means I have to relive it again? 

00:04:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, at some level, but you won't be doing it alone. And we'll, we'll work together on taking away that power, uh, of it, and so maybe then you won't have so much power in the thinking, uh, process. So initially, uh, there might be, uh, some uncomfortability, you know, but we'll have to work on that because, uh, I think if we don't do that and we just do from here on, eventually the thoughts will keep coming back into your head. So the bottom line is, is that, uh, we'll work on taking the power away from the thoughts. You can't change any event, you can't change anything, but we have to work on making peace, uh, with the past so we can go forward and have a lessened, uh, impact. So I just wanna be up front, uh, with you what we'll start doing, and if that's okay with you. But I'm not gonna tell you that it, uh, you know, it will be fun. But I'll tell you it can be worth it. And, and it's a lot of work, you know. And, uh, we'll have to deal with some things that will probably be uncomfortable. But again, it'll be a, a partnership type of thing, and, uh, from what you were just telling me, you're used to doing everything solo alone, and so that makes, uh, the anx-, uh, heightened and those types of things, so. 

00:06:10
JODI S. JOYCE Okay. 

00:06:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY So that sound like something that you're willing to do? 

00:06:15
JODI S. JOYCE To some extent. 

00:06:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY What's "some extent?" 

00:06:20
JODI S. JOYCE Sounds a little uncomfortable. 

00:06:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, I'm not saying it won't be uncomfortable, but somewhere along the line, we'll be establishing a trust, you know, to, there's a phrase we call "blind faith," you know. How more painful can it be than what you're going through now? 

00:06:45
JODI S. JOYCE Everything feels like the same thing. 

00:06:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY So you're very, you're in emotional pain now, right? You talked about you can't, uh, sleep, but I bet you you can't eat really well either, and all those heightened arousal types of things which are scary, which are, uh, very good in a combat type situation are not good in a civilian, uh, setting, uh, in that, and the employers are not always familiar with them, and family members are not always familiar, uh, with them, but, um, you're in enough pain to give it a shot, it sounds like, though. 

00:07:20
JODI S. JOYCE Sure. 

00:07:20
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:07:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY So, you know, give me some, kind of an idea, uh, which way to go. Maybe you can give me a, a little bit about what are the most uncomfortable, uh, emo-, feelings that you have or what are the types of things that trigger more than others 'cuz you're probably familiar with things that cause it more than others. 

00:07:45
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:07:45
JODI S. JOYCE Anything that's an absolutely loud noise. So when you hear a loud noise and you can kind of hear something in the distance and you can count 'cuz you know how long it's gonna be before that makes it to where you are and where your station is and, so experiencing that live, when you hear that, you start counting in real life. And then I have to say to myself, "Why am I counting?" So we typically would hear a boom, and you wait 60 seconds, and I'd start counting. So any kind of loud noise, I'd have, I'd feel like I'm a little kid just rocking in a corner, try-, counting for no reason at all. So the big, it's tough 'cuz every little thing that happens on a normal basis, it seems like I'm still living in that world. 

00:08:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So you magnify those types of things. 

00:08:30
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah. 

00:08:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY So it, after the 60 seconds, it continues on. So the event, even after the event is over. 

00:08:40
JODI S. JOYCE I can't even lay down and sleep without it continuing. Like, in the middle of my sleep, I'm shaking, my legs are shaking, I, I probably look like I'm convulsing. 

00:08:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY So is there anything that gives you any kind of relief? 

00:08:55
JODI S. JOYCE Headphones. Music. 

00:08:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY But if it's in your head, that really doesn't block, that might block, so there's external sounds, then the internal sounds, and so you went from external to internal. So you, that might be somewhere, but you still got the sounds running around in your head even with the headphones on, it sounds like. So... 

00:09:15
JODI S. JOYCE So then if I hear the stuff outside, I go crazy. I can't, I hear things on speakers and I, I literally just need it to be quiet, like stop talking. Stop listening, stop talking. So it's not quiet music, has to be really loud, like tone everything out. 

00:09:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY And you've learned somewhat to do that, but not totally. 

00:09:35
JODI S. JOYCE No. 

00:09:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Kinda hard to tone it out at, at home or at work. 

00:09:40
JODI S. JOYCE Just muffles it. 

00:09:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah. It got really (inaudible ). 

00:09:47
JODI S. JOYCE Right, right. 

00:09:47
LARRY L. ASHLEY So that's the sound issue. Uh, are there some other things? 

00:09:50
JODI S. JOYCE I'm really worried about the anxiety and the sleep and the stress. I have huge anxiety, huge panic and stress. I just, I mean, I used to be just very kinda go with the flow, get a job done, no problem, and now every little thing stresses me out. 

00:10:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY So are you, uh, taking any sleep aids or, uh, drinking alcohol, any, um, or? 

00:10:15
JODI S. JOYCE Haven't seen anybody yet for sleep aids. Um, alcohol started as soon as I got back. It was the only way to numb it. You can only deal with so much going on that every time you turn around you see it, and it does not go away. 

00:10:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So are you drinking more, then? 

00:10:30
JODI S. JOYCE I really didn't drink prior to it, so yes, I'm drinking more. 

00:10:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY Okay. And, but, are you see your tolerance to the alcohol increasing? You have to do more and more? 

00:10:45
JODI S. JOYCE Absolutely. About two to three a night, martinis, drank constantly, and I did-, I never was a drinker. Never needed it. Never smoked. And now I have to function, go home, and I need something. That's how I can fall asleep, but I know I'm not sleeping well 'cuz I'll have massive nightmares, and I know I'm waking up sweating and shaking and, so, but to try and do that and sleep, it won't work unless I drink. 

00:11:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY So you got a, a double whammy on the sleep. You're, you can't go to sleep, but when you go to sleep, you're afraid to be asleep, so you wake up. 

00:11:20
JODI S. JOYCE So I can't lay in bed, so I have to be out on the couch with my dog. 

00:11:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY So if we're looking at a continuum of maybe one to ten, uh, on the sleep, uncomfortable, or ten being really 

00:11:30
JODI S. JOYCE Actually being asleep? 

00:11:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah. Or, or ten can't being asleep at all. I mean, that's the extreme. 

00:11:40
JODI S. JOYCE I cannot remember the last time that I fell asleep without having absolute flashbacks, nightmares. I, I can't remember the last time I just slept. 

00:11:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY So sleep is an issue we'll, we'll look at. That's a nine or a ten area. 

00:11:50
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:11:50
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:11:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY Uh, as a rule. So, and the reality is, uh, if you have a nine or ten, uh, it, if we can get to a five or six, that's a big deal, right? 

00:12:05
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah. 

00:12:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Because, uh, uh, a one or a two is a long haul, but initially, we're trying to get you to have some sleep because sleep deprivation can be like a drug. And so we see folks with sleep deprivation, that it's, that's an altered state of consciousness, uh, on that. 

00:12:25
JODI S. JOYCE Are we gonna have to do drugs to do that? 

00:12:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Nope. Now, down the road if, you know, uh, after maybe 10 or 12 sessions of doing something that doesn't, or there might be some situational, uh, things. I know a physician that's familiar with combat-related stuff that I'm partnered with, might be, but medication doesn't mean forever. But I'll be honest with you, I've seen, uh, in severe cases where, uh, there might be some medication forever. But, you know, uh, again, medication is an adjunct to what we're doing. It's in lieu, because I've never seen a magic pill, uh. 

00:13:05
JODI S. JOYCE I just don't see how, I don't know how, I just don't see it happening. Like you go to sleep, how are you in control of what's gonna happen after that? That's why I just don't wanna sleep. 

00:13:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you don't know you have a choice if you don't know you have a choice. And since right now you don't ha-, you don't see any options here, you're in your last leg or you wouldn't be asking to see me, you know? So it's a matter of looking at the, the pain, the pain that you're going through, how can that be much worse than what we'll work on, you know? We have a, there's an old cliché in our business, are you tired of being tired, you know, of, uh, and so I have to, you know, take a look in. I'll be honest with you, you know, some days it'll be this way, and some days it'll be this way. And, you know, that's life, but like I said earlier, our goal is to get you to take back some of the power. 

00:14:00
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:14:00
LARRY L. ASHLEY You can't change anything, and there might be times, uh, as long as you're alive where you might have a bad dream or certain things, but the goal is, uh, through practice, like practice and, and stuff, that we can, uh, work on you taking some, uh, control. 

00:14:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY So sleep is definitely gonna be at the top of the things that we're gonna look at. Are there some other areas? 

00:14:25
JODI S. JOYCE 'Cuz in there we can work from getting me back to not sleeping in a recliner? 

00:14:30
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:14:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, that would be part of it. We'll look at your routines, and when we look at sleep issues, uh, we look at change in habits, you know? Uh, work with extreme, uh, sleep issues, and so part of that is changing, changing the environment, your sleeping environment, you know? Um, uh, it's not usually good, uh, when you can't sleep to have sounds and light and all of those types of things, you know, so I, I, when I work with clients that can't sleep, we look at changing where they sleep and how they sleep, you know? Uh, people laugh, but really, the, the bedroom is only for two functions, sleep and sex. And so any distractions, no matter how low they appear, can, uh, get in your head and stop you from sleeping. So we'll, we'll visit that routine a little bit more, uh, and that, and, uh, it's a, basically an issue about feeling safe. You don't feel safe, you don't feel safe in your bedroom, there is some safety in the recliner, uh, you know. 

00:15:40
JODI S. JOYCE I think it's only because I'm sitting up and I have 

00:15:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, whatever, yeah. Whatever that is, and you probably see differences depending on your day. So, and the stressors at work and family can exacerbate, you know, all types of things. And you're probably not getting much sympathy at work or at home because, uh, you know, employers or family members are not familiar what, what we're talking about and, uh, a lot of times, uh, you know, they just figure you should just say no and get back to 

00:16:15
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah, some people don't see it as an issue. 

00:16:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah. Well, the military doesn't see it as an issue a lot of times, so, you know, in the military if you present with that, a lot of times they'd just say, "Get back out and do your thing," so. Well, so, we were looking, uh, 'cuz they're all tied together. Part of our process will be a total, uh, mind/body wellness thing 'cuz you make yourself physically sick by how you think, and if you're physically ill then that can get in your head too. So a lot of the things, uh, we don't attribute to, uh, your past experiences because it's been years and we think that because it was years ago, get over it, and it shouldn't ha-, have that, you know? Just like, uh, sometimes, uh, teeth grinders, teeth grinding is a classic case of polytrauma or stress. Uh, we don't attribute it, uh 

00:17:05
JODI S. JOYCE During the night? 

00:17:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:17:10
JODI S. JOYCE 'Cuz during the day I don't teeth grind, but I have my jaw shut. 

00:17:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you can clamp it so hard that you have, uh, pain all the way up in that, but, so that's a physical manifestation of, uh, that. 

00:17:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Dizziness is another thing. I don't know if you're feeling, uh, being dizzy, but stress can cause that and what we would is, uh, you know, this is our first time and I read some of your intake and stuff, but, uh, uh, and it, and it impacts the immune system so I would guess that you probably get sick easier, have colds more often, all of those kind, and, you know, uh, and the, the reality is, you have a new brain. So we're gonna work on reprogramming the, reprogramming the brain, and I would guess that you would see some difference, uh, in your health, uh, getting colds, you know. 

00:18:05
JODI S. JOYCE That will help that? 

00:18:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Should help that 'cuz psychologically, um 

00:18:10
JODI S. JOYCE There's no doubt that that was horrible. I spent two sessions in the hospital last year, and neither session could they figure out what was wrong. 

00:18:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:18:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, even a simple things as cold sores can be traced, uh, uh, sometimes to, uh, stress and anxiety. So there's a lot of physical manifestations of emotional trauma that we don't look at. We figure, there are organic reasons for why our body shuts down, but there's a lot of psychological reason and I would guess as we go through this process you will notice some, uh, your health changes, your physical health changes, uh, your stomach won't seem like it's on fire a lot, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, uh, those types of things. Uh, you would see some improvement. It's gonna be over the long haul, but we're gonna do some short-term things that will help you when you're not here, how you can distress. 

00:19:10
JODI S. JOYCE What's "long haul" mean? 

00:19:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, uh, you didn't get this way overnight, did you? It's probably 10, 15, or 20 years, I'm just guessing, so the long haul was we plant the seeds and we'll work on how to water them, and then, uh, it, it could be a couple years or more before you start to see, a major, uh, significant change, but you'll see some change short-term, and it's like, uh, practice. 

00:19:40
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:19:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY We use the analogy of, uh, sports. The more you practice, uh, the baseball, the, the better you get the baseball. That doesn't mean you don't make an error occasionally or that, but it's practice. So practice of that. 

00:19:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY Self-affirmations, saying that you're not nuts. Or think, yeah, now, you can feel like you're going nuts, that doesn't mean, it's the behaviors that we're working on. And so we'll reframe the thought process. We'll do grounding exercises. "Jody back to earth," uh, you know, types of things which will, which will seem like, uh, simple things. So they don't have to be major surgery, brain surgery type of things. 

00:20:20
JODI S. JOYCE So if I go through all this work while I'm going through the work, what do I do about my husband? If he's a main trigger. 

00:20:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, that would be, uh, recommend some family therapy, some, uh, couples types of things 'cuz like, uh, in fact, I looked at my calendar before I came in, actually you're scheduled to come in to see me tomorrow, uh, we'll start, uh, talking about some family issues and eventually we'll work on maybe getting him to come in 'cuz education is a big, uh, thing with significant others. You know, uh, uh, uh, letting them know, uh, you know, what could be some of the signs and the ways to approach that, so that's part of the long-term pra-, uh, plan. You know, we'll work individually on you, we'll start planting the seeds for some family couples types of things, and move down the road. It depends on the, on the spouse, uh, you know, uh, significant other, or main significant other, depending on what the case is. Uh, uh, we can move, we'll move forward on some of that whether he decides to part of the, the solution anyways, uh, you know. 

00:21:30
JODI S. JOYCE He doesn't think there's a problem. 

00:21:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you can't change him. All you can do is change you and you're changing might have an impact on him, you know. And when I do work with employers, it's the same thing, you know, it's, uh, uh, so that's the, uh, so we have short-term, maybe intermediate and in the long term. But we gotta start. And starting is the great apprehension, uh, because, uh, you don't, uh, that's, you're not familiar with where we're gonna go. You're familiar with where you've been. And so sometimes no matter how painful the past is, it's comfortable and familiar. It's moving ahead and something new and how much you are invested in, in the process. 

00:22:20
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:22:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY So it'll start out uncomfortable. We'll be, it'll be a collaboration, uh, then we'll kind of phase, uh, me out of the picture, you know, so that would be kinda like the plan. So in the next, uh, the fir-, this session and the next couple I'll do more of a history, can you get me an idea what areas to focus on. Uh, the one that's the obvious again, is the sleep and the deprivations and that, but there might be other things that you don't attribute whatsoever that we might. So we're not gonna have a major list. I don't believe in having over three or four treatment goals anyways, initially. You can always stick one in there, but we'll have three or four goals that we'll focus on, uh, based on a severity type of a situation and impacting on your daily living. Uh, I'm not big on the diagnosis. Uh, I'll tell you up front, uh, you know, that's, uh, what managed care and, uh, folks, employers have. I don't believe in primary or secondary diagnosis. You either have it or you don't. Uh, so we'll, uh, work on that. So no matter what, uh, uh, even if, uh, you could maybe warrant a diagnosis, we won't put a lot of, uh, uh, thing on, on that 'cuz that's a mixed bag and, and a diagnosis. 

00:23:45
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:23:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY The goal. So the goal is to get you. How do you function in your daily living, that's the goal, no matter what we call it, whatever to prove, uh, your daily functioning. So so far does that sound like a livable plan? 

00:24:05
JODI S. JOYCE So far. 

00:24:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY So is there anything else you think I should know before we move forward? 

00:24:15
JODI S. JOYCE No, I, I just, I'm, I still don't see the process, I still don't see how it's, I know. 

00:24:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY I'm going back to the blind faith or, or, or the trust, right. But obviously, from this, what you've said and looking at your physical and that you look beat. That's not a diagnosis, being beat, but you look beat, you know. So obviously, you know, it's taken its toll, uh, all the way round. 

00:24:45
JODI S. JOYCE What do we do that's immediate so that it doesn't just get worse 'cuz we're on like a day-to-day thing right now. And like I said before is I'm close to getting a gun. Not that I was gonna do anything with it, but more of, the dog wasn't gonna protect me enough. 

00:25:00
LARRY L. ASHLEY Oh, getting a gun mean, can mean all kinds of things. 

00:25:00
JODI S. JOYCE 'Cuz I had a gun the whole time to protect me. 

00:25:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah, but what would you do with a gun? 

00:25:05
JODI S. JOYCE Make sure it'd keep me safer. Maybe I'd sleep. 

00:25:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY So having it sleeping beside you is one thing, now you're thinking about using it? 

00:25:15
JODI S. JOYCE No, I just wanted to sleep 'cuz I slept fine when I had a gun laying next to me. 

00:25:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY And so there's no, no weapons in the house? 

00:25:25
JODI S. JOYCE Not yet. 

00:25:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So have you, uh, told your husband or any-, anybody that you're thinking of getting a weapon? 

00:25:30
JODI S. JOYCE No. He thinks I'm crazy. He doesn't think there's a problem. 

00:25:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:25:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY So the gun would be a, a, a, a protective factor because nobody could if you, it felt like if you had the gun, then nobody could sneak up on you or you'd be prepared to defend yourself. Right now, then, you think you can't protect yourself. 

00:25:55
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:25:55
JODI S. JOYCE Very vulnerable. Which is why I can't sleep in the bedroom. I have to sleep out by the front door in the living room in the chair. 

00:26:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY More space. Is the chair looking at the front door? 

00:26:05
JODI S. JOYCE Yes. Pointing to it and dog sleeping right there. 

00:26:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY But you're tolerance now is increasing, so, uh, uh, that's why you're looking at the, the different to-, uh, ways to, uh, feel safer. 

00:26:20
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. So I'm wondering which will come first and help fastest so that I 

00:26:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it's only conjecture that, that a gun will, uh, make you feel safer, you know? Uh, can't tell you not to get that, but that might not be, uh, a good thing, a good option at this point because, uh, that, you, you're verbalizing that's why it would be as a protective factor towards others, but if you're in so much pain, uh, what's to stop you from, uh, using it on yourself? Or somebody else? 

00:27:05
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:27:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY You know, right now you're looking at tunnel vision. The gun is that. But we all know from being around weapons that guns can have all kinds of ramifications. 

00:27:20
JODI S. JOYCE I know exactly what they do. 

00:27:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY You know, so, and, uh, uh, a lot, we hear a lot of people verbalize about having a gun or a weapon and doing stuff, but my experience with, uh, combat veterans is that's probably not good because, uh, uh, a weapon is part of them, in a sense. 

00:27:40
JODI S. JOYCE That's the hardest part is dealing with it for so long and having it for protection for so long and then you don't. 

00:27:45
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:27:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yes. Well, I wouldn't recommend it, you know, option. I would, uh, if that would come up to that, I would think, uh, uh, we, we should have tried a lot of other things. And so I can understand your immediate need, but let, I'm go back to it, this doesn't happen overnight. It's st-, extenuating the process right now, and so, uh, uh, the next session we'll look at trying to get you here, uh, a schedule in a couple days and we'll, we'll start really quickly, uh, looking at some of those other options and homework, that types of things, so. 

00:28:25
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:28:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So do we need to come up with a, uh, uh, a plan, uh, a written contract like a thing right now that you won't hurt yourself? 

00:28:35
JODI S. JOYCE I don't have anything to hurt myself right now. 

00:28:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY No, but you're thinking, and you know how to. 

00:28:45
JODI S. JOYCE I know many ways. 

00:28:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah, so those are things, uh, uh, uh, prior to getting weapons, uh, you know, to think about. So would you be wil- 

00:28:55
JODI S. JOYCE Is it an agreement with you? 

00:28:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yes. We could go in many ways. Formally in writing or having you check in every day with me on the phone. 

00:29:05
JODI S. JOYCE That'd work. 

00:29:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY You know, uh, and so we'll be flexible in how we do certain, uh, things, but 

00:29:15
JODI S. JOYCE I'm just worried it's to a point, that's why I was asking is if it's a daily thing, I think that would be better 'cuz I'm not looking forward to going to sleep tonight. And so if I don't have somebody to talk to tomorrow, I'm not sure how it's gonna work. 

00:29:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So we talked about a ton of negative things. What positive things do you have going for you? Anything? Any strengths? Any positive types of things that could be mitigating factors? 

00:29:45
JODI S. JOYCE I have a job. 

00:29:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, but a job can be 

00:29:50
JODI S. JOYCE It sucks, but I have a job. 

00:29:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, jobs can be looked at good or bad or ugly depending on the situation. 

00:29:55
JODI S. JOYCE It's better than being unemployed. 

00:29:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, that it, it, it is. And it keeps you outta the house. It keeps you away from your husband. 

00:30:00
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah, but it causes more stress. 

00:30:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it is. It's a catch-22. Damned if you do and damned if you don't. 

00:30:10
JODI S. JOYCE So then I call in sick and stay home. 

00:30:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, there's a, you got a ton of options. I can't decide that for you, you know? All I know is that you're in pain now, to the point I would guess that you're willing to try some different things, no matter how, how uncomfortable they will feel. And there are, be things you haven't done in the past, so that's why there can be anxiety when we think about that, too. 

00:30:35
JODI S. JOYCE It's kind of like if I'm scared of an elevator, you're gonna put me in an elevator? 

00:30:40
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:30:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, that could be, uh, something if you can say possibly, but we won't be doing jumping in, like the elevator. We'll show you some of the buttons and how to, you know, and, in different reframing, uh, types of things. But, I'll be up front and honest like I have been so far, you know, you'll probably feel uncom-, more uncomfortable before getting better 'cuz there's no way, uh, ethically, I could say that this is gonna be a fun ride. And what, so look at your expectations of what you wanna get, uh, get outta this, and I'll go back to what I said earlier, you know, you didn't get this way overnight, so it's not gonna change overnight. You want it to change overnight, but realistically it's not gonna change overnight. You know, so, uh, the small steps are very significant in that. So look at, have a different ruler, a different compass, and be willing to take a look, uh 

00:31:35
JODI S. JOYCE There something I can do right now that with the noise problem? 

00:31:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, I, there's some things maybe you could, but there's some things you can't change, you know, uh, the kids are gonna be hollering, the job's gonna be doing, uh, uh, uh, uh, this, uh, this. You can, uh, uh, maybe look at taking the power away from some of that, uh, the noise, but, uh, initially, that's gonna be kinda hard because that's the driving thing, you know, uh, on that. But certainly we'll look at fast tracking some of those, uh, types of things 

00:32:15
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:32:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY And going back and, white noise it probably isn't just noise, it's the kind of noises, right? 

00:32:20
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:32:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY And when they happen and what, you know, type of, uh, uh, things, you know, uh, uh, uh, prob-, you're probably getting feedback, uh, at home and your employer like, "It's over, so get a life," and they don't realize 

00:32:35
JODI S. JOYCE It's never over. 

00:32:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY It's in your head. You know, and just because an event is over doesn't mean it's over. So you, you're doing a lot of "woulda, shoulda, coulda's," you know. "I should be able to," "I coulda done this," and, um, while that might work on some areas, that's not gonna, probably, uh, 'cuz you can always come up with a, a would or a could. The thing is what can you do, not what should you do, you know, and is there a right or wrong. So it's like an experiment on, on those types of things. 

00:33:15
JODI S. JOYCE Okay. 

00:33:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:33:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY I would be great if, uh, going through all of that was a fun ride and, uh, wasn't some of that, but, uh, that's usually not realistic, uh, on that. 

00:33:30
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah. 

00:33:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY So that, that's, uh, seems it would be the plan of attack, uh, from what we talked about so far. Then down the road we'll work on some of the, uh, other, other things that, take the power of the noise away and get you to sleep. Like I said earlier, I bet once you start to sleep, you'll notice a lot of different things. 

00:33:50
JODI S. JOYCE Maybe it'll help with the noise? 

00:33:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yep. Your appetite. 'Cuz once you can eat and sleep, then you pro-, that's progress, uh, on that. So down the road, uh, part of your thought process, you'll see pa-, your vocabulary change and your thought process. I would guess, uh, that when you talk, you talk in one or two or three syllable words and so 

00:34:20
JODI S. JOYCE Usually not good ones. 

00:34:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yes. Because that's how you're, you're thinking that way and that's, uh, that. And, and, and one of the things that a lot of times, and I will say, you're not the only one that thinks like that, so don't think you're alone. That doesn't make it feel any better necessarily, but you're not alone, uh 

00:34:40
JODI S. JOYCE Meaning my choice of words have changed on a, I'm, that's what you're saying? 

00:34:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, uh, the situation you're in. 

00:34:45
JODI S. JOYCE Oh. 

00:34:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY And, well, that, and the choice of words, too. You know, that's part of the, part of that process. That's just like we wanna have just good thoughts and not have bad thoughts, but it's impossible just to have good without bad thoughts. 

00:35:00
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:35:00
LARRY L. ASHLEY You know, because you have thoughts, and you learn to say this is, feels good, and this feels bad. And another person might have flopped it around, that what you feel as bad, they feel as good, or vice versa. Not good or bad or, or ugly, so to speak. 

00:35:20
JODI S. JOYCE I mean, some people in my family feel it's a whole different, I'm a, a whole different person. I, I think I should be censored sometimes. 

00:35:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you are a different person because you think differently and all of that. 

00:35:35
JODI S. JOYCE So then with the profanity and everything that comes out, it makes it even worse. 

00:35:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:35:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yes, I imagine it does. Especially if you live in an environment where that's not used. And, you know, if you come from a, a military context like we're talking about, uh, that's the norm, you know, and so part of the thing is to downshift your language a little bit, so you might get less feedback from them, negative feedback, but there's other ways to, to talk about, uh, different things, and that's part of that vocabulary thing, you know? 

00:36:15
JODI S. JOYCE 'Kay. 

00:36:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY 'Cuz in the military, we're very good at, uh, couple-syllable words, and they're not usually, they're all "F," whether they're F-words or not, you know? And so, in certain contexts, if you're teaching school, "fuck" is not a good word, usually. 

00:36:30
JODI S. JOYCE And it comes out a lot. 

00:36:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah. Even if the kids say it all the time, that, well, you know, there's a different, uh, uh, how to say it, uh. So I can you're your pain, and then we'll, we'll work on your pain, and we'll try the, the exposure stuff and if that doesn't seem to work after maybe 10 or 11 things, we'll look at shifting gears, but I think you will see, start to see, uh, some fairly immediate, uh, things. 

00:37:05
JODI S. JOYCE 'Kay. 

00:37:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY And immediate doesn't mean this big. Immediate could be this big. So that's about expectations. So I think that's very important in looking at, at, so after we've been together five or six times, uh, might not be realistic you have a whole night's sleep. But you might have a couple two, three hours at a time, or the sleep pattern. So the goal is not how much you sleep, it's the kind of sleep. 'Cuz we see people that sleep ten hours, but, but if you wake up every hour, that's not good sleep, right? 

00:37:40
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:37:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY So it's not just the amount, it's the productive sleep that, uh, we'll look at, and, so how you remem-, uh, measure, uh, progress, uh, and that type of stuff as well. 

00:37:55
LARRY L. ASHLEY And in the meantime between each session, uh, you can start thinking about things that, uh, surface that you didn't think about in the past or are heavier words, more powerful words that we can, uh, go over. 

00:38:05
JODI S. JOYCE Okay. 

00:38:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY So I think that homework will help because even if we're not around you can have 

00:38:15
JODI S. JOYCE You want me to write them, what do you want me to do with them when they come up? 'Cuz they're all day long. 

00:38:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:38:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you keep them down and they could be food for thought for what we do here, but at least put them on paper and hearing yourself because they run around in your head and so a lot of times, uh, folks say, "Well, I think about it all the time," and think other folks have ESP. I don't know what's in your head. And just because you're thinking it, doesn't mean I have any clue what's in your head, you know? And sometimes, even if we're not together, you can say it to yourself because there's a difference saying something out loud to yourself than to thinking it 'cuz we think too much. You're thinking probably too much. Your mind is racing. So how do we bring it back, and it might be just verbalizing some thoughts instead of thinking them, uh, might be something. So that might be some homework that we'll look at, you know, to, uh, uh, uh, that, so. There'll be all kinds of things and over the next couple times we'll look at, uh, ways to help kind of put them in action, uh, uh, on that, so. That will be kind of what we'll, uh, focus at. The, uh, is your husband, uh, uh, gonna be the type you think that will, soon as you go home from this session, try to probe you about what you talked about? 

00:39:35
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:39:35
JODI S. JOYCE Oh, yes. He wonders why I went in the first place. 'Cuz he doesn't know the half of what's happened, so. 

00:39:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY Yeah, well. You're doing it for you and not for him, and that's, you know, that's everything, but like I say, once we start getting into some of the family issues, we'll, uh, focus in on that. 

00:40:00
JODI S. JOYCE 'Kay. 

00:40:00
LARRY L. ASHLEY Just keep in mind the change is for you and not for him or the other things. So it can have benefits to your environment. 

00:40:10
JODI S. JOYCE Okay. 

00:40:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY But you gotta, uh, you know, buy into doing that or it's probably not gonna, and that can be a while. 

00:40:20
JODI S. JOYCE 'Kay. 

00:40:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY That's the gist of how we would go, uh, uh, forward. I think we can open it up to any, uh, uh, questions. Uh, this, uh, was, was like a first time and then there's all kinds of ways we could, uh, uh, go. 

00:40:35
Do you think with an average person there would've been so much disclosure? 

00:40:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, you know, uh, by the client? 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:40:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY I've seen it both. I, I've seen them like I'm playing dentist to have to pull teeth. Then you see some, whoa, whoa, back to earth, back to earth, you know, so it just depends. Uh, sometimes people that are in a lot of pain, this will, vomit all kinds of things and it goes too much, you know? Uh, then there're, uh, then as a, a, a therapist, you gotta look at how comfortable you are with silence, right? Uh, 'cuz I've always deal with my students that I think the best technique is shut up a lot of times, you know, and learning, uh, uh, uh, that. So it, it could be either one. And at one session, could be this way, the next session could be this way. 

00:41:25
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:41:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY It could be, it, it just, uh, so that goes back to, the therapists need to look at their moral inventory on a regular basis and see what their vested interest is and then if, if you want it more than your client, you already lost, and so, uh, and that. But on the first session, it just, you know, can be like a honeymoon so they're o-, and honest, then if they're driven by other people or whatever, they can just sit there and look at you, or in, uh, uh, I would say, uh, a caveat, uh, when you're doing combat stuff, uh, uh, uh, uh, the question almost, she didn't say it, but almost every time that I ever had a client, they wanna know if you're a combat veteran as a therapist and so, uh. If you are, uh, there's challenges. If you're not, there's challenges, uh, you know, because if you're, I call it the warrior-therapist phenomenon, and so, uh, uh, you gotta watch that your client don't suck you in because you can relate and how much you give. So I, uh, when they ask me, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I say, "Been there, done that. Next?" You know, it isn't about me, you know? And we're not gonna, uh, doing that. And I don't believe you have to have been, um, a combat veteran. It gives you a frame of reference, but it can be a risky frame of reference 'cuz you can relate to darn much, so you have to really watch, uh, where you're going. 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:00
How do you handle concealed weapons permits with a veteran with PTSD? 

00:43:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it is a tougher call with a veteran because, uh, uh, they're framed as a weapon, and I always say facetiously but serious-like, if, uh, uh, if you go to a gun store and they're out of guns, you know where they all are. And so, uh, I do a lot of work, I train police forces how to deal with combat veterans. And, uh, because, uh, they have a ton of them, whether they're concealed or licensed. And they, here's the thing, they know how to use them. 

00:43:30
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:43:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY And so when a veteran is talking about suicide types of things, I'm probably more active than a non-veteran because, uh, you can take it to the bank, when they're talking, they're seriously thinking, uh, in that. So the call, I had a good friend that was a, a chief of psychiatry at, uh, VA, and she always used to say the minute one of the, her patients says they're thinking about it, she, the door is shut, and they, they come and take that person. 

00:44:05
If a person has chronic PTSD and they believe they are more susceptible to suicide, should they have their gun taken away? 

00:44:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, here, here's an, uh, uh, uh, analogy, uh, if it helps. We, in traditional mental health, whatever that is, I'm not sure what it is, but you know, what we train, we always use the phrase, "Is the glass half full or half empty?" Combat veterans, I, I throw that one away. The glass is always half empty. So I'm concerned with how they look at death. You cannot be, anybody that's ever been in combat has killed somebody, seen somebody killed, knows somebody, or all of the above. So death is planted in your head. 

00:44:40
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:44:45
LARRY L. ASHLEY So you can think about it nonstop. That doesn't mean you're gonna do it. "It's in my head. I can't get it out. I think death around the clock. Probably when I'm sleeping." That doesn't mean I'm gonna kill myself, but death is who I am. And so it, in the civilian world, you know, when we hear, uh, the person says, "I've had these thoughts," uh, you know, this and that. Uh, that might have a different thing to, to, uh, see, there's a different norm. 

00:45:10
LARRY L. ASHLEY I once, I developed a program, uh, for combat veterans in residential substance abuse, a mandatory, uh, one. Uh, and, uh, at the end, the last part was death groups. What, what I find is a lot of times therapists don't wanna deal with death issues because their own personal stuff or it's, it's heavy. So never ask about, uh, did you ever think about killing yourself or death because you might get their an-, uh, what they think, and there's different types of things and they, that's a different head set, and so the, making peace with the death issues. And so, and how you die. Uh, soldiers, you know, if you ever been in combat, you figure you're gonna die a violent way. Somebody's gonna kill you and shoot you or whatever. Now I'll give you a personal experience. I almost died in Vietnam, but it wasn't from being shot, almost that times too, I got anaphylactic shock from dysentery from the medications. My tongue swelled up, I couldn't breathe or damn swallow. That was not fair. For years, uh, decades after that, I could never, uh, could make peace with that way of, uh, kissing Death. I was ready to, as much, I figured I'd be blown to hell or vaporized or some shit like that, but, uh, that, that wasn't fair, you know? So there's different ways of death, so I do major death histories. I do major death treatment type of thing after certain stuff is, uh, we've laid the groundwork and, because I don't think ethically you can turn somebody loose without halfway making peace of what death looks like. 

00:46:45
Do you think it's important to bring in the spouse for couples counseling or a separate counseling session with the spouse? 

00:46:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY Oh, both is, uh, what I would recommend, but we see this as a major family, uh, uh, thing. You know, uh, some spouses, you'd have to lock them up, tie them in, and drag them in 'cuz it's not their problem, it's everybody else's. I'd recommend that, but I would go ahead and do, uh, uh, it's not the same as having the couple, but I would work on couples things individually if I couldn't get, uh, the person, uh, yeah, because they're not always, uh, they're, they come in and like this, or, or, or, or whatever, uh, in that. And also, I'm glad you brought up the National Guard piece because, uh, there's some uniqueness. Uh, there's gender issues, there's Na-, difference in National Guard and Reserve. As a fact, I'm doing a conference, if you're interested in, in the main, just another combat trauma conference just on the National Guard and Reservists, just because of the unique, uh, citizen head set. And the, and you have to understand, these multiple deployments are worse. I always use an example, in World War II, you know how long you were in World War II? Until you came home! It was four or five years, that's what it was. Psychologically, this, that, you know, uh. 

00:48:05
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:48:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY I, the Army, I spent last May at Fort, a week at Fort Bliss, the Army had me go to Fort Bliss to train their, work with their therapists and their family advocacy program, and, and there were several guys going back for number five, and, and if you ask them, "What do you think?" "I'm going home!" Hey, I can relate. "I couldn't relate to come home 'cuz my wife was bitching at me, the kids are doing this shit, so I slapped them around." You know, over there, yeah, that, that's going home. Well, we fle-, figure you just flip the damn switch when you come home and get a life. And the younger you are, you're 17, 18, you can't even shave, you're going over there and, and, and doing that, it's in your head. I always tell my students, permanent means forever. That's what permanent means. Forever. So we, we work on programming to get to that point, uh, you know, and, and it's individual, that's why we call it individualized treatment, right? Because everybody's different. 

00:49:00
How do you deal with veterans that self medicate? 

00:49:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, yeah, that's a big, uh, thing. In fact, I just did a poster on combat trauma and addiction. That's my, uh, thing. Yeah, we see it all, uh, uh, of that. 

00:49:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:49:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY Depending on what stat you read, 20-25% of anybody's been downrange has been on Ambient or anxiety/depression. If the Department of Defense pulled the plug on buying Ambient, the whole company would go out of business. Uh, and so, uh, I've never seen the, uh, much, uh, so, uh, I think being anxious is a good survival tool in combat. I don't, I don't want you to be numbed. Uh, it might be uncomfortable, but that's just a, uh, so we're dependent and magic, uh, magic pill. Uh, one time these prescriptions were indefinite, almost. Uh, last year the DOD said, "Well, maybe they shouldn't be forever." Duh. But, uh, and so we'll look at maybe a six month type of thing. So when I like to make the military nervous, which I like to do, or, or people, I, I say, "Well, I'd like to do a study, I'd like to do a study, I wanna do a study on everybody got a script while they were downrange and are out of the military now, and see if they're still on scripts." Or the, so we do that, and they, there's the self-medication, but I'll put in a plug for what I call my "unholy trinity." Problem gambling, eating disorders, and sex. More people have sold their soul and body on those than ever thought about what heroin and alcohol. There's an epidemic of problem gambling in the military, and it's all machine-driven primarily. I've done some stuff with the Navy at San Diego and that, and they'll tell, I, I had them tell me up front, they're seeing more of that than they are of the drug and alcohol. Uh, the army makes millions of dollars in the clubs and that, that's. There's no natural satiation of any of the unholy trinity. You can go into it, you know, heroin and alcohol, you can only use so much, you get dead or you pass out or something, uh, uh, there. So we need to screen for those. Uh, you know, as a civilian, you can do that, but the military won't let you do that, as, as a rule, but those, uh, things. There's that self-medication, you know, to block out, that's a natural thing to numb out stuff. You just get too good at being numb, uh, uh, on that, so that's a big, uh, thing, you know? I'm, I'm right now, we're, I'm on a doctoral nursing, um, uh, committee with a VA nurse practitioner, male nurse practitioner at the local VA, uh, who wants to start a, uh, uh, opiate pain reduction clinic because they're passing off zillions of scripts in the VA clinics now for high-end opiates. I, and, you know, I'm not saying there isn't pain, but there's more pain clinics than gas stations, you know, or even maybe Starbucks, heaven forbid. But, you know. So it, it is a, it is a big, uh, deal. 

00:52:00
How do we know as counselors that what we're doing is successful? 

00:52:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, the, the, the reality is, we never know if it's helping, you know? If we were in this business so that we, we would know, we don't always know. Uh, this is like what's the sign of, what's success anyways, you know? It, it's very hard. 

00:52:20
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:52:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY We, it goes back to expectations. It's, uh, it's not realistic to not have those thoughts based on, you know, what you've gone through probably, but how's it impacting your daily living? So are you functioning more, uh, is it more productive at home, more at work, you know, those types of things, you know? So it, this is very hard to measure, you know? Uh, and we're in the movement to brief therapy. Brief therapy works for certain folks, but Jesus, you know, uh, it's like going to the emergency room, you're bleeding all to hell, they put a Band-Aid on it, and the blood's stopped, but you didn't do anything about he got bleeding, you know, uh. So it, it, it just depe-, it, it, you know, it just depends. Uh, is it user-friendly? I'll give an example 'cuz I do a ton of stuff with female veterans, uh, I would challenge you to find, your local VA clinics, if they have an obgyn doc. Uh, you know, uh, there's been a movement to try to get some, but user-friendly. I, I, I know, uh, that, that, that General Halstead's retired. She was the first woman that graduated from West Point and became a general. And, and, you know, some of her trials were. The Army makes one boot size, basically, you know, uh, it doesn't take into consideration male or female boot sizes or, uh, so a lot of those types of things. The stress from jumping out of a helicopter is different from a woman than a man. You know, we see menstruation issues. We see a lot of other physical things, uh, but they haven't been really, uh, up, it might vary from according where you're at, but as across the board, they're not user-friendly to women which probably depending on the stats or, could be as high as 15% in the military are, are, uh, female, and probably 6 or 7% are married couples, you know, so we got a whole different, you know, ball game. We've never had this many National Guard and Reservists. I know National Guard and Reservists that are doing five and six deployments. And we can't understand, well, that Dad, uh, uh, Daddy's different. Well, Daddy's the same body, but he ain't got the same head, or, or the women, you know? This is a major family issue, you know, how, uh, uh, this. And so we got tons of kind of unique, uh, issues. 

00:54:45
How many families are there where a spouse or the children have secondary PTSD? 

00:54:50
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it's a family disease to me, and so it impacts. So, well, we see more divorces, with males we see a lot more violence and acting out than normally, uh, you know? Uh, it's a trans-generational, almost, like that. You know, I've, I've seen, uh, it's just like working with rape victims. You'd think the, the daughter was raped, but it was grandma, and so we see a lot of, uh, based on that frame of reference, you know? The, that I had a cousin that was a Marine DI, all the kids had to call him Sir. You know, uh, because, you know how things, uh, get translated down. So it is not a genetic thing, it's a frame of reference thing. It can be, uh, you know, like that, and so, uh, we're, that's why we're seeing the World War II vets with PTSD, 60 years after they're out. There's glue, there's, uh, functional PTS glue, and it tends to be jobs and family. So when you, more so with men, but it varies, and once they have, don't have a job and empty nest, that's why I'm always after unions and retires, you gotta have reti-, or, you know, with the, it is a big deal in family issues. Now, you take a guy that's 80. 

00:56:05
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:56:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY In fact the, uh, LA VA has a group just for these guys this age, and, and, and some-, it's been 50 years or 60, 40, 50, 60, and all of a sudden, and they haven't slept for 40 or 50 years or they haven't done something, but they don't work or they don't have anything else, now the stuff is manifesting and they, and they couldn't figure out what the hell it was and then they started, "Well, you know, there might be a name to that," or there was something like that, at least they can die in peace. Here's another group that you never any, chaplains, chaplains with PTSD from combat, because the, you know, they're considered, uh, whether they are or not, uh, mental health professionals. So they hear crap that the shrink don't hear, and they can be overwhelmed, uh, you know? Uh, so it's just a different, uh, uh, religious aversion is another area that we, uh, or spiritual aversion, you know? It can either make everything stronger or worse, but this definitely is an assault on your system. Uh, so these are types of issues, you know, uh, what, uh, we're doing, uh, we're seeing now, uh, more, uh, young guys now in the prison system that, not as much as Vietnam, but it will be in a hot minute because, and the continuum, there's no gray area. It's zero or ten, uh, you know, on that. So we're, we're, uh, the police, you know, again with the work with the police, uh, you know, the police have had tons in the National Guard and Reserve. You lock and load a gun Iraq and Afghanistan, now you're, you're back on the street carrying your weapon in two weeks. A kid gets in your face or a woman yells at you, they get dead. It ain't a thought process, this is part of the education. This is an automatic thing 'cuz if you, in combat, if you have to think, you're dead. There ain't no thinking. It's gotta be damn automatic! We figure you get home and you throw away the automatic and just think about, uh, and so we're seeing tons of, uh, veterans now that go to the, uh, the first responders. Police, fire, EMT, or prison guards, those are the four, uh, that are gonna get the most because they're the, as a rule, most similar. 

00:58:20
How does confidentiality work with a C.O. on Active Duty? 

00:58:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it's different. There's no such thing as confidentiality in active duty, or the VA, really, is there? So this is what we would, we would go over. I, I be over to the civilian therapist all the time and say, uh, you know, uh, this and that. 

00:58:40
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:58:40
LARRY L. ASHLEY And they find out in the VA or the military that, "Who in the heck do you think goes to those meetings? the First Sergeant is in all those damn cases," you know? Uh, when you staff a case in the active military, here's the First Sergeant who might be your platoon leader or, uh, there's no secrets so confidentiality has, has a big difference depending on how you got there. If they said you go there, there's definitely no confidentially. If you chose to go there, then it can depend on, uh, who the person is, so. 

00:59:10
What are your thoughts on the term "Post Traumatic Growth?" 

00:59:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, that's two, and another, just another thing, uh, uh, if, I don't know if you buy into the 12 steps, but, you know, um, if you took out "drugs" and put in "victim," there you go. Uh, uh, there is, uh, hardly any, there's something called War Veterans Anonymous, but we hardly see any meetings in the country, uh, where they do that, but if you, what it is is, uh, you've accepted the victim role. And so if you've accepted the victim role big time, that means everything was done to you and, and so, so we work on not being the victim, uh, on that. So I found that very good individual therapy just, uh, plugging some of those out and if you just take a, take out drugs and powerless and put in, uh, sometimes, uh, that works. 

01:00:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY So reframing, that's part of that reframing. I have to say, of course, I have a lot of (inaudible) And they're not always official, uh, but, uh, and DSN, but I always say, "If you think you're a piece of shit, you are." And so I know it's crude, but I never said that I was politically correct. Uh, so the, the phrase is how you think about yourself is who you are. And so if you think that, there it is. It's a self-affirmation in a sense, maybe a negative one. So it, it, it's a reframing. But I, what I wanna mention 'cuz I'm running across it in, in Vegas, is civilians that will not take a, a combat veteran if they know they're a combat veteran. Part of that stigma is, uh, not realizing about what that means, but I've heard of the National Guard is reser-, uh, referred people to therapists and they're, uh, civilians, and, uh, they've said, "No, because they're dangerous. I won't touch them. I'm afraid of them." And part of the stigma we have to go out is, and, and say they're people too, they have come from a different frame of reference, but they're not all like that Rambo or, you know? Uh, they're, pe-, and there are var-, you keep in mind, there's resilience factors too, so everybody responds, uh, differently. 

01:01:30
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

01:01:30
LARRY L. ASHLEY We don't have enough people to treat, you know, therapists in the first place. Uh, but, uh, to rule out automatically you're not gonna take any veteran that's seen, uh, action, is unethical, immoral, to me. But it's happening. It, it's happening, you know? Uh, so, it really concerns me big time 'cuz we got some cases and people have different (inaudible ), but that reminds me about the, the officer type of thing. We had a case in Vegas about five years ago, a young guy, 20 years old or something, just back from Iraq. He's walking in, I don't know if you're familiar with Vegas, it's a, a part of town called Naked City, and it ain't because it's on the strip, but, uh, he probably shouldn't be there at 2:00 in the morning. But, uh, a long trench coat, two guys came out and stuck a gun in his face, he killed them so damned fast that he didn't even know what happened. And so he's arrested for first degree murder, and it happened that he happened to get a judge that was kinda user-friendly, and, uh, took that into, uh, consideration. So he got treatment in lieu. But it was an automatic thing. The guy, under his coat, had an A, AR15 locked and loaded and, and knew how to use it. So he killed those guys that stuck the gun in his face so damned fast they didn't even know what happened. Uh, but, you know, the system was not, uh, equipped, you know, as a rule, to deal, uh, with that. So you get programmed automatically. And well, then we had a case in an emergency room, this young guy comes back, another National, uh, Guard guy comes back. He's out throwing down, drinking, what like, what young jitterbug guys do, um, and he gets in the emergency room of this hospital, and, uh, the nurse is doing her thing and, and he says, "Well, you know, I just got back, and I've been, several, several deployments, and I would like to be, uh, get respect, you know, for treatment." She kept, she started arguing with him, "Well, you've never been. You're too damn young to be down there." She was arguing and arguing. Eventually, he almost killed her. They had to come in and peel him off of her neck, and one of the security guards at the hospital was in his unit, and he said, "He's not lying. He just got back." He almost killed her in an emergency room, the nurse, just for a simple thing, raising her voice and, and dissing him right there, almost kil-, she almost committed suicide, and she didn't know it. Uh, so you, the moral to the story is don't be afraid, but they got a different head and they look at things differently, so sights, sounds, noises to you might be innocuous, you know, uh, you know, those types of things. 

01:04:15
With confidentiality, stigma and re-entry issues, how do you promote better mental health treatment? 

01:04:20
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, it, it, it, in some cases, it's damned if you do and damned if you don't, but it's, you know, uh, are you, uh, in more pain now or are you gonna be, is it worth it, uh, you know, uh, uh. There is still a stigma in the military that, even if there wasn't gonna be something happening to them, uh, you can't be, you know, a real man or a real woman don't talk about crap, uh, and that. So we, we have to, that's a plus, not a weakness, that's a sign, uh, of strength, uh, uh, to do that. And, and you have to be up front with them, you know if, uh, uh, you're in, in that system and I'm in that system and there's some realities of, uh, uh, uh, that. And, and now so they, you know, uh, I would not, um, seek them out to tell those, those info-, you know, that information 'cuz there's a trust issue, right? You know, they can't believe that you wouldn't be telling everybody everything. So it, it depends on their frame of reference and where they come, but these are big issues. Like we talked about earlier, if you wanna make a career, I see the same thing in the police force, in the fire department. And I'll never forget that case, I was called to evaluate a, a homicide cop who was trying to retire, uh, and get a medical discharge. He drank like a damn fish and the cops let him go, one of the big city police departments, he was good 'cuz he volunteered to do what nobody else would do and, uh, he drank and, and so they wouldn't do any of the DUI, you know, they let him, because he's a good ol' boy and that, but eventually they couldn't do that. This is a guy, had his jaw shot off in Vietnam. They shot his damn jaw off. They built him a hell of a face, and if, if you didn't tell him, looking at him, you wouldn't know he had a new face, but he had a new face. Took a couple years, but he had a new face. Not once did anybody ever address any of that, uh, uh, trauma or, or anything. Now, after pushing 30 years at, as, as a homicide cop, uh, it was never addressed, and so he can't get a medical re-, uh, retirement unless he's sober, right? 

01:06:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

01:06:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY Uh, so I, I, I evaluate him and then they said, "Well, what do you think?" "I think, here's what I think. He ain't gonna like it, but this is what I think, since you ask me. If a miracle happened today, that man can't break even." Look at all of this baggage for all these years! Not once has he ever talked about it. He's got a family don't know anything about it. The police department don't know anything about it. Nobody's asked him, and he sure in the hell ain't volunteering. Now the man's in his, uh, late 50s or pushing 60, whatever the hell he was, now you're gonna say, "May the Force be with you." Now the man's gonna be sitting home, thinking too damn much, mind racing, cleaning his weapons, and doing other things. And you say, "Get a life." That is his life. What's he got to live for? I don't say he's gonna run amuck or anything, but you know? Not once during that did anybody take time to do anything and he sure in hell didn't volunteer it. He had his new face. They didn't do anything else, but he got a nice face. And so, you know, we see, uh, tons of that. And I will throw in the TBI thing because that's a thing, uh, and it's kinda hard to tell TBI from PTSD. In fact, lot of the first cases that were diagnosed as TBI were actually PTSD cases and the, because of their, and they're similar, and you get people have both of them. So what the hell, you know? Uh, this is not a new phenomenon. This was not invented in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was in a mechanized infantry unit in Vietnam, we, we would be hit, and a track would be hit and it'd blow everybody's damn eardrums out of their head. You also saw it in World War II. We got tons of veterans my age and older with TBI. There's no evidence whatsoever, but if you look at it, that might explain some things, so I'm glad they're doing stuff now. This is not new. I always say when military psychiatry, it has amnesia or other things. We, we tend to, you know, uh, forget like that. Uh, want PTSD? Get to the, the, the battalion aid docs out there that gotta make those calls. I've had, um, cases of physicians that had PTSD because, you know, they were obgyn, pediatrician, or something in the military and they said, "Guess it's your number!" You're shipped to, down to the, to the battalion aid or wherever so you're seeing blood and guts way beyond anything you've ever, ever thought, you know? So it, it, it, it's different, you know? Uh, uh, did some work with a, our local congressman is an emergency room physician, Joe Heck. He's a colonel in the Reser-, Army Reserves so he's been, uh, but we were talking about, his concern was, 'cuz he, a battalion aid doc makes the call do you go back into combat. And, and for two or three days, you can't tell diddly crap. How do you make a call to send somebody back because usually the symptoms don't come out for days or months and, and, and that. So we'd see all kinds of things, right? Uh, we talked about military sexual trauma, the number of men that'd been raped in the mo-, the military had just, you'd fall over if you were honest. And, and you gotta cut their arms off for them to cop to that one 'cuz there's all kinds of, 'cuz rape is a way to put those guys in their place. 

01:10:20
How do you feel about prolong exposure therapy? 

01:10:20
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

01:10:25
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, yeah, and, and I think it's, uh, like, uh, with a toolbox, you gotta have more than a hammer 'cuz everybody's a nail, so, uh, that. I, I find it, uh, most successful, but there's a point like, you know, after maybe 10 or 12, or times, or just could be different than maybe something, uh, as hell. What I get concerned about is I see a lot of, uh, therapists holder single out their experts in this and this and they want you a two-hour online, uh, training so they're, they can do this or this or this. Uh, uh, prolonged exposure is very, uh, user-intensive, uh, you know, takes its toll on the therapist too. So you gotta, you know, see what fits. You know, a friend of mine, David Foy at Pepperdine did that monster style, uh, study that the VA did where they compared exposure base to traditional present-centered in about 10 or 12, uh, VA centers, all done by PhD clinical psychologists, manualized, you know, uh, whatever. And so the outcome was what? There was no damn difference. I thought, I felt vindicated because I hear horror stories all the time. "Well, don't talk about the past because they're traumatized they're gonna be doing that." Uh, I really think, I'm present-centered too, but before I'm going prison-centered, I'm going back to help you make your present-centered. Now that might not always be that, uh, but that's what I would start out with, based on my evaluation. If I have to shift gears, I have shift gears, uh, on that. 

01:12:00
How do you feel about meditation therapy? 

01:12:05
LARRY L. ASHLEY You know, a lot of it I re-, I find is how you sell it to the client. You know, uh, the message we give out, you know? 

01:12:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

01:12:15
LARRY L. ASHLEY If we say they're, it looks like there's no or this is gonna be, you know, that has a lot to do, and it depends on the person. You get somebody that's a frequent flyer in the system, they know more about therapy than you do, uh, you know, that's, uh, uh, so there's a lot of that. That's why I go back, again, "individualize." 

01:12:35
LARRY L. ASHLEY Well, I've been, the hook is coming out, so, uh, it's been real. So, uh.
