Counseling Men: Key Concepts and Implications 

00:00:00
Dr. Carlos P. Zalaquett and Dr. Ryan E. Barbeau

Dr. Ryan E. Barbeau 

00:00:15
>DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Welcome. My name is Carlos Zalaquett. I am a professor at the University of South Florida and here with me today is Dr. Ryan Barbeau, a clinical psychologist who's a professional practitioner in an our area and also an instructor and also adjunct faculty at USF and at the Professional School of American Psychology in Tampa. We have had the privilege of collaborating and co-teaching multicultural courses and I have enjoyed learning and working with Dr. Barbeau. So I thank you so much for being here today. 

00:00:55
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Thank you for having me. I've enjoyed teaching with you as well and I look forward to collaborating on this project as well. 

00:01:00
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Thank you. And actually this is a very interesting project because it's about counseling men. And what we're going to do is discuss key issues about counseling and psychotherapy with males and introduce specific solutions and recommendations to increase your effectiveness in working with this particular cultural group. And on that note, let me introduce our conversation by asking Dr. Barbeau, what do we mean when we talk about counseling men? 

00:01:35
Counseling Men 

00:01:35
Dr. Ryan E. Barbeau 

00:01:35
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Yeah, great. I appreciate the question. So, when we look at the multicultural counseling literature, there's lots of different literature on lots of different ethnic groups, gender groups and things of that nature. But one area that we found where's there not a significant amount is on counseling men. I think that makes sense because one of the main ideas is we want to pay appropriate attention to groups that are more oppressed by society and typically men are seen more as the oppressors. But that doesn't mean that they aren't also victims of some internalized societal messages that cause problems for them. So in the same way that we wouldn't want to take a color blind approach when working with certain ethnic minorities, we wouldn't want to ignore the fact that this male client sitting in front of us also has been significantly impacted by things such as sexism, such as racism in our society. So a brief example to illustrate would be comparing a female client versus a male client with similar presenting issues. So for example, in a campus counseling center a female client who is graduate student in one of the hard sciences such as physics or chemistry, may have concerns that she's experiencing discrimination both implied and explicit from supervisors, from other faculty. And most counselors because of the significant progress of the feminist literature and counseling from that perspective would recognize that they need to really help this client flesh out and better understand what sort of internalized societal stereotypes she's experiencing and how better to combat those and with a sense of empowerment. Alternatively, a male client who's looking into entering a field such as elementary education that is seen more as a feminine field, may experience similar internalized stereotypes that make that decision process very difficult. But counselors may not always be as aware of the necessity of bringing that issue to light and exploring that with them. So many of the topics we're talking about kind of come from that angle. The idea that ignoring the male client's maleness as an important aspect to explore would be really tantamount to ignoring or taking a color blind approach with an ethnic minority client. 

00:03:45
Men as oppressors or perpetrators 

00:03:50
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT What an important concept. But also, it ties up with something you mentioned earlier which is the idea of males as oppressors. What can we share with our audience in terms of that concept? Males as oppressors. 

00:04:05
21-34% of women are physically assaulted by male partners 

00:04:05
33-50% of males admit to some act of sexual aggression 

00:04:05
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Sure, sure, good question. When we look at oppressors or perpetrators and males fitting that role, there certainly are unfortunately plenty examples of that. Statistically the rates of, you know, aggression, murder, rape, things of that nature, are significantly higher in the male population. Anecdotally, just picking up any newspaper, there's plenty examples of politicians and athletes who have behaved in highly self-destructive ways. Self-destructive ways having to do with sexual exploits, aggression, basically fitting into that real male stereotype. So unfortunately, that is the case in our society. It's hard to ignore and argue with that data. 

00:04:50
Men as victims 

00:04:50
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT I can certainly understand that. Now what about the other view? Males as victims. 

00:04:55
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Mm-hmm. I think that's a very important, sort of mindset for the counselor to consider. If we just look at them as perpetrators, it's hard to really bring forth that, that empathy that we need to be therapeutic with them. So we also have to consider what comes with that. Higher rates of homelessness, higher rates of substance abuse and many other issues as well. So if we kind of flip the script there and recognize that males are also victims of these internalized societal norms, societal stereotypes, we can kind of approach them more with a therapeutic sense of empathy for their plight in our society. 

00:05:30
Reasons for lower utilization rate among men 

00:05:35
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Also help us understand, why do you think there's a lower utilization rate of our services, you know, of counseling, psychotherapy and other mental health services by men? 

00:05:45
Client reasons e.g., "Big boys don't cry" 

00:05:45
Some Counselors view males as not ideal therapy clients due to difficulty working with emotions 

00:05:50
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Okay, so that's a great question. Let's look at that. In the therapy relationship, there's the client and the counselor and they both contribute to the relationship. Let's take them one at a time. First of all is the client. When you look at how young men are raised in our society there's certain messages, again, both implied and explicit, that men shouldn't cry. They shouldn't be sissies. They should toughen up, you know. Perhaps talking about one's problems or being emotional is something that a female would do and in a male that would show weakness. So when a male is experiencing distress and considering what their options might be, it takes a lot of real effort and courage to kind of transcend those messages and pursue a counseling relationship. On the other side, counselors, we're trained to kind of identify what aspects are, would make for an ideal psychotherapy client. Some of those would be kind of emotional awareness, ability and skill to express those emotions and willingness to be open with the counselor. So when counselors experience clients who are able to do that, able to understand their emotions, articulate their emotions, they'll feel more comfortable with that client and probably behave in ways that will encourage that client to come into counseling in the first place and to continue with the counseling process. Alternatively, counselors may not be thrilled when they get a male client who seems very closed off to emotions, not very willing to open up. And the counselor both consciously and unconsciously may behave in ways that sort of discourage that client from continuing with counseling. Sort of send that message that you're not an ideal client. So really, I think there's responsibility on both sides of that equation. 

00:07:35
The paradox of society progress 

00:07:35
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT How fascinating. And we were also talking about the paradox of societal progress. What an interesting concept too. What is your take on that paradox? 

00:07:45
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Right. So there's definitely a lot of examples we can be proud of in our society in terms of advances when it comes to sexism, racism, etc. With males in our society, definitely some prime examples would be just that if you walk into a bathroom, there's now changing tables where males can now do that if they're providing for their young children. So that's definitely an excellent example. But at the same time, males are now expected to be more contributors to raising children as well as also providing financially, etc. So with any kind of progress, there's also growing pains and challenges there. And it can really bring about a lot of shame for males when they're not able to satisfy all the different expectations that are placed on them. But again, it's kind of like a double shame because for males, it's not just the shame. But then when you feel the shame, you're ashamed to be ashamed because males aren't supposed to feel that way. So it's really kind of a double whammy when you think about it. 

00:08:50
What can counselors and psychotherapists do? 

00:08:50
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT I'm so glad you mentioned that because to an extent counseling men is a complex issue. So what can we share about what counselors, psychotherapists and mental health professionals can do when counseling males? And I remember during our conversations you mentioned several key recommendations and I would appreciate it if we can summarize those here today. 

00:09:25
1. Combat shame using a culturally sensitive approach 

00:09:25
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Sure, sure. I appreciate that. Yeah, there's several points that I'd like to make in terms of things to be aware of when working with male clients. Our first opportunity to help the male client comes in the initial intake. If we consider that there probably is at least some shame involved with them seeking psychotherapy, we can recognize that and address before attempting to jump into any particular issues. With that, some analogies may be helpful to help the male kind of understand, reframe and appreciate the importance of coming into counseling. For example, the analogy of a carpenter sharpening his saw rather than just continuing TO plug on and cut away. Or the analogy of a professional golfer using a swing coach to consult with and help his game. Both of those would probably be readily accepted as wise rather than shameful. Once that premise is accepted, males can enter the counseling relationship feeling proud of the courage it took and the intelligence it took to address those issues rather than the shame. 

00:10:25
2. Be careful with your professional language 

00:10:30
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. What about the idea of language, using appropriate language. 

00:10:35
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Certainly, that's a very important point as well. So as clinicians we may use certain language such as intake and client and not think much of them because it's part of our daily terminology, the daily words we use. But for the male client coming in, this is kind of strange or different or unusual and makes it seem kind of overly clinical perhaps. So when possible using other more benign terms such as our first meeting, or if it's in a college counseling center referring to them to as a student instead of a client, can really kind of lessen some of that clinical feel and make the client feel more comfortable. 

00:11:10
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Another interesting concept you and I have discussed before is the idea of validating before pointing out weaknesses. What an interesting idea in working with males. How do you see that? 

00:11:25
3. Validate Strengths 

00:11:25
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Definitely very important as well. So males may come in with certain comments or certain world views such as winning isn't everything, it's the only thing. And as counselors we're trained to kind of quickly pick up on maybe the pathological nature of some of those comments, the black and white thinking. And in our efforts to be helpful may be quick to jump in and point that out and encourage some kind of modification or being able to see the gray. But with male clients it's important to realize that in our society it is a very hyper competitive society and really that attitude may have reaped certain benefits for them. And until we kind of acknowledge, respect and honor that, they probably won't be open to us looking to kind of modify that world view. And instead of really changing it, I think that idea of modification, something that's additive and augments it is really better so it doesn't become a power struggle between their world view and a world view that you're trying to convince them of. But rather accepting, acknowledging their world view and building upon it. 

00:12:30
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT We did talk about the idea of being careful with the language we use, but what about the idea of using male language and male analogies? How could that help in the counseling or psychotherapy process? 

00:12:45
4. use male language and analogies 

00:12:45
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Anytime that analogies can be used, or language can be used that draws from the male's career field or hobby, is definitely beneficial. So sports analogies kind of abound. There's plenty of examples of those. There's also the analogy of a tool belt and adding to a tool belt that certainly fits within the male language and world view and can be used in a lot of different valuable ways. So for example, anytime there's work being done on broadening the male's emotional repertoire beyond just anger, or anytime we're working on broadening the male's interpersonal skills to solve conflicts beyond aggression, the idea of having a tool belt. So we're not trying to take away the tool of anger or take away the tool of aggression, rather we're trying to add additional tools so that there's a broader repertoire to make them more flexible, more adaptable in different situations. 

00:13:40
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And you also mentioned the idea of attaching an emotional image to issues and issues highly charged emotionally. What will be the best way to approach those issues initially with the client? 

00:14:00
5. Use "one step removed" when approaching emotional issues 

00:14:00
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Often I find that using a sort of one step removed approach can be very helpful to gauge where the male client is at. So for example if I can just mention that the other day I was speaking with this guy and he was mentioning xyz and seeing if the male client buys into that, relates to that in some way, can help me gauge where he's at and better decide sort of on what level I can approach him. And when I determine that, what kind of level he's at, so to speak, I can then offer certain psycho education that may be in line before proceeding into the topic. So I've found that often when males are kind of skittish around certain emotions, it seems like they're kind of out of bounds if you will, that perhaps they really are for that male something that's looked upon as unacceptable, not beneficial. They really do want to stay away from it. In this case, offering the analogy of touching a stove and feeling physical pain and recognizing that it's important for us to feel that physical pain because it allows us to take our hand away so that we don't get burned. If we left our hand there, we would get burned. In the same way, different emotions are valuable. We wouldn't want to not be able to experience sadness because it's really an important kind of insight and an awareness that tells us that there's something awry in ourselves and in our interpersonal relationships that we need to tend to. And once males can accept that premise, they may be more willing to acknowledge and explore with you emotions beyond simple aggression or beyond simple anger and really kind of get more in touch with some of those other feelings such as sadness. 

00:15:40
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Another interesting concept that you shared with me was the idea of using action empathy of counselors. Another important concept that you shared with me was the idea of counselors and psychotherapists and mental health professionals using the idea of action empathy. Help us understand that. 

00:16:00
6. Use "Action empathy" 

00:16:00
DR. RYAN BARBEAU That really follows along with the idea of using the client's sort of natural language, natural understanding. So males kind of tend to have very good analytical skills, may be able to predict how someone will behave. So for example, if we're looking at maybe a romantic relationship, rather than quickly jumping into emotions and saying, well how do you think your significant other feels in this situation. Ask a question along the lines of, what do you think she's going to do next? Males will likely be able to predict that. Once they've made that prediction, then you can ask the question along the lines of, well I wonder why she acts that way. That can lead you into a discussion that touches more on emotions rather than going directly for it. The same important emotional content will get addressed but it will do so more seamlessly rather than this abrupt transition into emotion-laden topics that males may not be as comfortable discussing right away. 

00:17:00
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Another interesting conversation we had was around the concept of using a "one step down" approach and helping males save face. How do you think counselors and psychotherapists can do that in actual sessions? 

00:17:20
7. Use a "one down" position and allow men to "save face" 

00:17:20
"You mentioned a, b, and c. Do you think there is any other way these might all be connected?" 

00:17:20
"You've explained being really good at helping others out, I wonder what you might advise a friend to do if they explained ______ to you." 

00:17:20
"I'm sorry, I got confused. Can you help me understand...?" 

00:17:25
DR. RYAN BARBEAU In counseling with males it's important not to sort of replicate a competitive environment with them. And oftentimes they will feel like they're coming in as the client, you're the professional, it can already put them back on their heels. So anything you can do to make the relationship more egalitarian will help them feel more comfortable and they'll be easier to collaborate with you. So some examples of statements that one might use that fit into that approach would be, you mentioned a, b, and c. Do you think there is any other way that these might all be connected? So rather than offering their interpretation for the client, you kind of lay it out and let them make the connection for themselves. Another comment that fits into that may be, you've explained being really good at helping others out, I wonder what you might advise a friend to do if they explained blank situation to you. So again, rather than you offering your view, give the client the opportunity to sort of offer themselves advice, so to speak. Another situation would be if the male client is having a difficult time articulating themselves. This may make them feel quite uncomfortable. When you look for clarification it's important to watch your language. And instead of saying things that will sort of place the blame on them for not being able to explain themselves more clearly, the counselor can say something along the lines of I'm confused. Can you help me understand better? And take responsibility for their half of the interaction so the male client is not felt blamed or totally responsible for the understanding. Lastly, when the counselor does offer certain ideas or opinions, they might want to kind of couch it or present it with a caveat that this might be a throwaway idea but I just thought I'd put it out there and see what you think. This provides sort of a way out in case the male client feels like that's not particularly accurate to what might helpful for them. Rather than throwing it out there in such a way that they feel either compelled to accept it even if they don't agree with it, or they feel like now there's a power struggle where they're trying to argue with you. As much as possible we want to avoid any sense of competition in the relationship and make it a purely collaborative process. 

00:19:35
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Another issue my colleagues bring up sometimes in working with males is the idea of the male bravado. And that makes it difficult to work with them and they don't seem to be willing to engage in the process. What is your reflection about that? 

00:19:55
8. Don't be fooled by false bravado 

00:19:55
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Right. I definitely think this can be very challenging for the counselor to work with. When the males come in with that certain bravado, it's very difficult to know how to respond. In some ways, it may kind of put us on our heels and we're not sure quite how to behave. In another way, we may want to challenge them quickly and, and sort of see what's underneath that. And oftentimes there is some insecurity underneath it, but we have to be very careful with our timing and let that unfold as it will. If we challenge too quickly, that may lead into higher attrition rates in male populations. So we need to be more patient as counselors and empathic and trust that underneath that there probably is some insecurity but it will unfold in time rather than us pressing buttons that's going to lead to higher attrition rates. 

00:20:45
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Another interesting suggestion that we have discussed is modeling. The fact that we don't need to have all the answers. It is okay sometimes to be in doubt or reaching out to find out more about a particular issue. What is your suggestion about that? 

00:21:00
9. Help clients realize they don't need to know all the answers 

00:21:00
DR. RYAN BARBEAU As counselors we often feel a great deal of pressure to have answers, to have solutions, but if we consider one of the issues being that males kind of have internalized this hyper competitiveness, this need for kind of perfection or having all the right answers, perhaps one of the most therapeutic things we can do when encountered with a real dilemma concerning the client, is to model that we don't have all the answers, that we don't have all the solutions. And then the fact that that's okay, that one doesn't always need to be perfect or have everything just right. As an example, I'm reminded of my work with a war refuge client who was dealing with a severely mentally ill wife and his two children, working around 70 hours per week to provide for them financially. And he consistently was insecure and hard on himself concerning the fact that he wasn't doing enough. And he constantly asked me questions about what could I be doing better. Help me understand this more. Help me do better so I can do a better job. And I found that over time one of the most therapeutic messages that I could provide for him was really taking a more humble approach and saying that I really kind of honored and respected and admired him. That really if I was in his shoes, I don't think that I could have done as good a job as he was doing. That of course didn't provide any sort of specific ideas for what he could do better, but just the idea that he could stop beating himself up so much, I found to be a very therapeutic intervention with that particular client. 

00:22:30
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And another issue that I've seen mentioned and that you also discuss is the idea of reviewing, addressing, you know, with males the specific conditions and situations they're in and the potential element or responses that they will face as they begin to change. 

00:22:55
10. Anticipate, embrace, and learn from roadblocks in change process 

00:23:00
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Mm-hmm. Yeah, I find as male clients start to become more emotionally expressive, there's certain kind of roadblocks or barriers that they commonly experience. So take for example, the male client whose partner all along has been saying that they're not emotionally expressive enough. That they want them to be able to be more in touch with their emotions. What if this male client begins making progress and instead of reacting with anger, may be in touch more with sadness, may even cry at times? His female partner, although this is something she wished for and hoped for, may not be comfortable herself kind of witnessing or being with the male client in that moment because she hasn't had a lot of experience watching males with that. So he may hit that road block where now he's made that progress but it's hard to negotiate that in the new relationship, both for him and for his partner who's not really used to him or other males expressing emotions in that way. In a similar way, males' relationships with other males may also be impacted. As they develop higher levels of identity development, moral development they may find that some of their male friends are not at the similar levels and they're really kind of just communicating in different ways now. The male client who has made those changes may feel misunderstood and may feel like the need to associate with other clients. And of course that's hard, to remake one's social group. So there certainly are challenges that as counselors we need to respect. That the change is positive, yes, but also comes with some very significant challenges. 

00:24:30
Female counselors working with male clients 

00:24:35
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yes, that's a very important issue to keep in mind, especially because the response from our peers and friends and colleagues, you know, may not be supportive initially. Now we've been talking about counseling, providing psychotherapy for males. So what can we say about a situation where a female counselor or psychotherapist is providing counseling for a male? 

00:25:10
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Yes. I definitely think if we're considering gender as an important variable here, then it makes sense to pay attention to the dynamic that there will be differences in the male counselor male client relationship and in the female counselor male client relationship. Female counselors, I think, would first off would benefit from recognizing that not all coaches were great athletes. So there shouldn't be a sense of insecurity in terms of, oh I can't help this male client because I'm not a male. Alternatively, females come with the ability to offer a very unique, helpful perspective, the idea of the female perspective. How might other females see, understand, feel and react to that male client? They also have benefits that in our society they've been able to learn how to balance or negotiate the professional life and the personal life. As our society progresses and males are expected, as well, to contribute both kind of professionally and personally in terms of child-rearing, that female perspective and experience can be quite beneficial. Some of the challenges that female counselors might experience is that when they're providing feedback to the male clients, they need to be real careful in terms of their countertransference. That when they're offering feedback, it needs to be objective, not subjective. So a real clear kind of understanding of are they reacting to the client in a way that all counselors, all female counselors would, or is this something particular about their experiences? Being able to tease those apart puts them in a better place to offer more therapeutic, objective feedback. I've also found that as female counselors work with male clients, the clients really appreciate the opportunity to be in a relationship where they're allowed to be more emotionally expressive and they'll form a very important, strong emotional attachment to the female counselor. This is a very important part of therapy and should certainly be embraced. However, it's important for the female counselor not to become the quote, unquote special woman in that male's life. As much as possible and as early as possible, the male should aim to have similar emotionally connected, emotionally expressive relationships with others in his personal life so that the female counselor doesn't take on a role that's too important and he becomes locked into that. We have to remember that therapy is always the practice, it's not the actual game. So we have to encourage male clients to make those connections outside. 

00:27:25
Male counselors working with male clients 

00:27:30
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very, very good. Now what about the reverse, when males are providing counseling psychotherapy to males? 

00:27:40
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Sure, sure, so certainly other issues to consider there. With male counselors, it's important to understand that the male counselor was raised in the same society that the client was. So the male counselor has also internalized certain societal ideas in terms of emotional expression. And it may be that the counselor and the client collude together to avoid emotions. So it's very important that the male counselor make sure that they don't kind of fit into a comfortable interaction of, let's just be real analytical and let's not explore emotions. That can be a real issue for male counselors. Alternatively, similar to things we've discussed in the past, you wouldn't want to push the male client towards those emotions too quickly. It needs to be a gradual kind of exploration, where the male client is really taking the lead and there's not a competitive sense to it. So I'm not placing myself as a counselor above the client and sort of making them feel as if they need to sort of get on my level. I'm really collaborating with them and at their own pace we can explore emotional topics together. I think that's a very important piece. So that modeling as well too, that this doesn't need to be a place for competition and this is place for collaboration. Or if anything, the client can really be the leader in those situations. 

00:28:55
Dr. Carlos P. Zalaquett 

00:29:00
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT What an important set of views about counseling men. I believe, and we have discussed it with Dr. Barbeau and we both agree, that counseling can be as beneficial to males as to any other group, cultural, ethnic groups. So the more we learn about how to provide effective services for males, the better service, excuse the redundancy, we can provide. So the question is now, what do you think? What have been your experiences with working with males? How some of these key concepts have panned out in your experience? And also, what other elements can you add or share about your perception of males as clients and of counseling males? So on that note, let me let Dr. Barbeau finish up our presentation for today. And at the same time, reiterate how appreciative I am that you were here. 

00:30:15
DR. RYAN BARBEAU Well I thank you as well for the opportunity to do this. So I really hope that this is kind of a starting point where we can kind of go beyond here and look more at the idea of male clients. What particularly unique presenting issues do they have? And what can we do as counselors to improve, to make them feel more comfortable to attend counseling, more comfortable to stay in counseling, and more likely to come back counseling in the future? 

00:30:40
DR. CARLOS ZALAQUETT Thank you.
