00:00:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Hello, I'm Dr. Kathryn Geldard. In the last two lectures in this series, I described the use of miniature animals and the use of symbols in a sand tray to join with a child and to help them to tell their history. However, just joining with a child and enabling them to tell their story is not in my view is efficient. Initially, after the child has talked about their worries, they need to be given the opportunity to talk about these in more detail. We need to go with the child's phase, so that the child can begin to give us some more detailed picture of their world. As the child shares their innermost thoughts, they're likely to start to get in touch with uncomfortable emotional feelings. Can you see how a sequential counseling process starts to develop? Firstly, we join with the child and help them to talk about their troubles. Then, we give them time to continue talking in more detail and as they do this, they are likely to get in touch with their emotional feelings. Now, if the child is to feel better, they will usually need to release any pent-up emotions. Some counselors believe that once a child has released their pent-up emotions, the counseling process is complete. I have a different point of view, this is because I believe that when children have been troubled for a while and are bottling up emotions, they will inevitably develop unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving. If we are to help them feel better in the long term, we need to help them make changes to the way they think and behave. Let me give you an example. As in the first lecture, I will not use a real case, but rather an invented one. 

00:02:45
A case study 

00:02:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Imagine a child called Amy, aged eight. Amy lives with her parents and has a brother Mark, who is five months old. Amy's parents have brought her to see me because her teacher has told them that Amy has emotional outbursts and is very aggressive with other children and disruptive in class. Amy's parents report that for the last few months she has been very emotional, throwing tantrums like a two year old and frequently crying over the trivial matters. At night, she won't go to sleep unless either her mother or father stay with her until she nods off. During the counseling process, it might emerge that Amy is sad because she feels rejected by her parents and angry with her baby brother blaming him for the displacing her from her previously central position in the family. Mum never gives me hugs. She spends all her time cuddling him. Dad doesn't care about me either. He likes Mark better than me, because Mark is a boy, she says. Mrs. Twigley my teacher doesn't like me either. She likes April(ph) and Francis, but not me. She keeps picking on me. If Amy is to feel better, it may help her if she is able to tell someone how she feels and to express and release her feelings with sadness and anger. However, just expressing and releasing her feelings might probably not be sufficient to help her feel better in the future, to think more positively or to change her aggressive behavior at school. As with many emotionally troubled children, Amy has developed some unhelpful thoughts and maladaptive behaviors in response to her sadness and anger. If she is to feel better in the future, she will not only need to release her emotions, but also will need to start to think differently. She will need to recognize that her mother and father do love her, clearly her parents would need to be involved in this process. Also she would need to start to think more positively about her teacher and more positively about herself. However, even these changes in Amy's thinking might not be sufficient on their own to change her aggressive and disruptive behavior at school or her tantrums at home. Unfortunately, when children have been using unhelpful behaviors for a while, these behaviors tend to become entrenched and may not change spontaneously, even though the underlying emotional issues have been dealt with. Consequently, counseling needs to continue until the undesirable behaviors are replaced by more adaptive behaviors. I wonder if you can think about how you would start to work with Amy. My belief is, that it would be a mistake to begin by focusing on Amy's emotional outbursts and aggressive behavior to other children. Instead, I would follow a number of steps in the counseling process, starting with joining. 

00:06:25
Steps in the counseling process 

00:06:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I believe it is useful to follow a series of steps or phases in the counseling process. These would include phase one. 

00:06:40
PHASE 1 Joining with the child & enabling the child to tell their story 

00:06:40

DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Phase five, helping the child to discover ways to change unhelpful behaviors. 

00:07:30
[sil.] 

00:07:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In our book Counseling Children, my husband David and I have described the series of phases which we believe are required when counseling children. We have developed a counseling model for use when working with children and I've called this Sequentially Planned Integrative Counseling for Children, the SPICC model. The SPICC model is sequentially planned because generally the phases follow each other in a sequence, also it is integrative, because it integrates the use of counseling skills taken from a number of different counseling models. Each of the five phases requires the use of a specific set of counseling skills taken from the particular counseling model, which is relevant for that phase. Let's look at each of the phases in turn. 

00:08:40
PHASE 1 Joining with the child & enabling the child to tell their story 

00:08:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In the first phase, while using media such as miniature animals or the sand tray, the Rogerian client centered counseling skills of reflection of content and feeling are the most useful. The skills are particularly non-threatening and invite the child to talk freely. When working with Amy in the initial phase, I would invite her to choose miniature animals to represent herself and her family members and we would reflect back to her the content of what she told me and what I perceive to be her feelings. I might follow up by using the sand tray in another session to encourage Amy to create a picture in the sand tray to show me what life is like for her both at home and at school before, during and after Mark's birth. While Amy was working in the sand tray, I would rely largely on using the counseling skills of reflection of content and feeling. Additionally, I would feedback to her my observations with regard to her placement of symbols in the sand tray and with regard to any theme that might develop. In her particular case, the major theme might be related to her belief that Mark's inclusion in the family has had very negative consequences for her. As a result of Amy working in the sand tray, her awareness of the issues that were troubling her and the way she was feeling might start to raise spontaneously and become apparent to me as the counselor. As a consequence, I might recognize that if Amy were to have her way of expressing her emotions more fully they could be released and she might be able to feel better. In this case, I would move into phase two. 

00:10:50
PHASE 2 Enabling the child to openly express and release emotional feelings 

00:10:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD During the second phase of counseling with children, I prefer to use skills from Gestalt Therapy as suggested by Violet Oaklander. Gestalt Therapy is experiential and because of this is particularly useful in enabling a child to express emotions, while working with an expressive media such as painting, drawing or clay. With Amy, I might use clay in conjunction with Gestalt Therapy skills, to encourage her to get more fully in touch with the physical sensations in her body, with her emotions and with her thoughts. I would encourage her to act out her anger as explained later in this lecture. Such a process could be very cathartic allowing her to yell, shout, jump up and down and release pent-up emotions in a safe situation. 

00:11:55
PHASE 3 Helping the child to feel better about themselves 

00:12:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Often, when a child has been emotionally troubled they will develop unhelpful thoughts and behaviors and will perceive themselves negatively, so that their self-esteem is compromised. Once the child has released their emotions it is generally useful to help the child to start to see themselves more positively. In the third phase of the counseling process, where we are helping the child to feel better about themselves, it can be useful to use strategies taken from narrative therapy, where the counselor helps a child to deconstruct the negative story they have of themselves and to place the story by a more positive one. Once again, if I were working with Amy, I would make use of media while using a narrative therapy approach. In Amy's case, I might get her to draw herself as a fruit tree using colored felt pens. On processing Amy's picture of herself as a fruit tree, I would encourage her to focus on her strengths, positive qualities and her preferred sense of herself. I will explain how to use the fruit tree activity in the next lecture. 

00:13:20
PHASE 4 Helping the child to replace unhelpful thoughts by more useful ones & and to look at their options and choices 

00:13:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In the previous three phases, the child has had an opportunity to tell her story, to express her emotions and to start to feel better about herself. It would be tempting for a new counselor to stop at this point, believing that all the useful work had been done. Certainly, at this point the child will feel better and it is possible that the child will spontaneously start to think and behave differently. However, in many cases unhelpful thoughts and behaviors which I've developed overtime will persist unless they are directly addressed. The best way to start to address unhelpful thoughts and behaviors is to use counseling skills taken from cognitive behavioral therapy. Using skills from rational emotive behavior therapy, the child can be encouraged to challenge self-destructive beliefs and to replace these by more positive thoughts. Additionally, by using skills taken from Glasser's Reality Therapy, the child can be invited to explore their options and choices and to recognize the consequences of making particular choices. As in previous phases, I think that it is important at all times when working with children to involve them in an activity. If I were working with Amy in this stage, I would make use of either a worksheet or the comic strip technique. I will explain these in the next lecture. 

00:15:10
PHASE 5 Helping the child to discover ways to change unhelpful behaviours 

00:15:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Clearly, cognitive behavioral work can enable a child to replace the unhelpful thoughts by more helpful ones and to look at their options and choices. However, it is sometimes difficult for children to change their behavior when this is becoming trenched. If this is the case, then the cooperation of parents, teachers and other adults may be needed, so they can collaborate with the child in devising a program, which can positively reinforce behavior change. I'm convinced that behavioral management programs are most effective when they are devised jointly in cooperation with the child after emotional issues have been addressed. And the child has had an opportunity to make changes to their thinking, so that they themselves are keen to change their behavior. Behavior management programs can be very successful in changing a child's behavior, where the child does not have underlying emotional issues. However, I have come across many cases in my counseling career, where behavior management programs have failed. Either they have not worked at all in changing the targeted behavior or although the targeted behavior has changed, it has been replaced by another maladaptive behavior. I believe that when programs have failed in this way, it is usually been because the child's underlying emotional problems, which have been driving the behavior have not been addressed first. 

00:16:55
Sequentially Planned Integrative Counselling for Children The SPICC model 

00:17:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD As I have explained, the SPICC model sequentially takes the child through a process, where they first tell their story, get in touch with and express their emotions feel more positive about themselves and then change their thinking and behavior. Instead of using skills from a number of therapeutic approaches in an ad hoc way, counselors using the SPICC model, selectively use the skills which are appropriate for each stage in the counseling process. Thus, client centered skills are used while the child is telling their story. Gestalt Therapy skills are used to help the child express their emotions. Narrative therapy skills are used to help the child reconstruct their view of themselves and cognitive behavioral skills are used in order to help the child change their thinking and behavior. Finally, a behavioral program may be necessary, where behaviors have become entrenched. Throughout this process the counselor makes extensive use of media and activity to ensure that the child is fully engaged in the counseling experience. If you read the book "Counseling Children" you will say that we have arranged the phases or steps in the SPICC process around a spiral to show how at times we might need to move from one of the phases back to a previous one or may need to go right through the sequence again if new issues arise. Naturally, I don't stick rigidly to the process I described, but vary it to suit the individual needs of the child and their responses to counseling. Today, I have described the SPICC process. In the previous lectures, I described ways to join with the child and to help them to tell their story. I would like to continue now by describing one way of helping a child to get in touch with and release emotions. This is by using clay. 

00:19:25
The use of CLAY 

00:19:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Most children but not all enjoy working with clay. A few children don't like getting their hands dirty and clay does tend to be bit messy. As you can see, I'm working with some clay now. Just working with clay like this can be calming for a child. I'm often asked by new counselors whether play dough can be used instead of clay. It can't be used in the same way as clay. Play dough is useful when working with young children and using imaginative pretend play. In this situation, children often like to use the play dough as pretend food, making it into shapes and putting it on toy plates. Clay is much heavier material than play dough, it is firmer and can be used to make large shapes. It can be flattened punched and stamped on. It can also be thrown, but I am not going to demonstrate that. Because of these qualities, clays are ideal for enabling children to express angry emotions powerfully. I buy clay in large blocks like this one here. It's relatively inexpensive and can be bought from shops that sell clay for artistic works such as making clay sculptures or pottery. This clay is to be usable for working with children. It needs to be in a condition, where it is soft and pliable. If you find that your clay is too hard, it probably means that it's dried out. You can always condition the clay by putting some holes in it like this. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Then, filling them with water. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Like this and sealing up the holes over the top like this. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Then put the clay inside a plastic bag so that it doesn't dry out again and in 24 hours the water will have dispersed through the clay making it more workable. Clay is best cut using a cheese cutter like this. You can easily make one out of a piece of nylon fishing line. It's also helpful to have some spatulas or wooden tools suitable for sculpting the clay. I prefer to work on a vinyl floor when using clay, because this gives the child an opportunity to act out emotions by throwing the clay at the floor or by jumping on it. However, in some situations it may be better to work on a table. Whenever, I intend to work with clay or paint with children in order to help them express emotions, I try to (inaudible ) the parents, so that the child wears cloths which are suitable for a messy process. Fortunately, clay will washout of cloths, whereas often paint won't. I will start work with clay by encouraging the child to make friends with the clay. This is a process first suggested by Violet Oaklander. 

00:23:30
Making friends with the CLAY 

00:23:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The idea of making friends with clay is just to allow the child to enjoy the texture of the clay and to enjoy handling and manipulating it into various shapes. Let me demonstrate what I do. I give the child a piece of clay and I take a piece myself. As I give instructions, I demonstrate what to do using my piece of clay, I say to the child let's make friends with the clay. First of all let's roll the clay into a ball like this. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now, let's flatten it. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Scrape it up, poke a hole in it, pinch it, pull it into pieces. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Gather it all up again, and roll it into a ball. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Like that, now tear a piece off and let's make a snake. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now, let's wrap the snake around your finger. I can then ask the child, what was it like to make friends with your clay and what did you like doing most. Once has the child has made friends with the clay I give instructions to help them use the clay to address a particular issue. Clay can be used for several different purposes as described in the book "Counseling Children". However, in this lecture I will only deal with the use of clay to help the child to get in touch with their emotional feelings and then express and release them. 

00:26:20
Using clay to help the child release and express emotions 

00:26:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Let's imagine that I'm working with Amy, the child I described previously. Firstly, I would say to Amy, I would like you to make a shape in the clay, which will be you and while you are doing that I will make a shape, which I will call me. Now, we could make shapes with the body, arms, legs and head, but I don't want you do that. I want you to make any shape and we will call it you, Amy. The shape can be any shape you like, it can be square or round, big or small, flat or curved have holes in it or be solid just any shape you like. Amy, might make a shape like this. Next, I would ask Amy to make different shapes, one for each member of the family. She might make shapes like these. This one for her father, this one for her mother. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD And this for her baby brother. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Next, I would give Amy feedback of what I had observed about the way she made the sculptures. For example, I might say, you took a lot of time to make shapes for yourself, your mom and your dad or you seem to be in a big hurry to make the shape for your brother or you have made the shape for yourself very small and the shape for your baby brother much larger. By giving Amy such feedback she might start to talk more animatedly than before about how her brother is always in the way and she doesn't get noticed any more. I would then ask Amy to arrange her clay sculptures into a picture, so that I could see how her family looked. How the family members relate to each other, Amy might rearrange the clay sculptures like this. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I would then give her feedback of what I had observed. I might say, I noticed that your mom and dad or touching each other and your brother is on top of them both and you are on your own over here. In response to this feedback, Amy might get in touch with her anger. She might say, "Yes, he's always with them and I'm not." I would then ask Amy to make a clay shape to represent her anger. I would say to her that if were her, I would be very angry, so it might be a good idea to make a very large shape to be her anger. Amy might make a shape like this. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now, assuming that I had been working on the floor with Amy, I would ask her to stand up and pick up the piece of clay that represented her anger and hold it in her hands. I would then ask her to say out loud what she was angry about. If Amy had trouble doing this, I would suggest to her that she start with the words I'm angry because… Amy might say, "I'm angry because Mark cries and get cuddled, I get smacked", or "I'm angry at mom for cuddling Mark instead of me", or "I'm angry with dad because he likes Mark better than me, just because Mark is a boy." I would then ask her to say the words very loudly. For example to say, I'm angry with daddy because he likes Mark better than me and as she says the words to through the clay as hard as she can onto the floor. I would encourage her to do this several times, raising her voice as she did. Now, many children will have problems expressing themselves loudly and enthusiastically in this way, because they've be correctly taught that it is not okay to act out the anger in front of other people. Because of this, I will usually pickup a piece of clay myself and shout the words with the child as we both thorough our clay onto the floor. With Amy I would also ask her to give me other reasons why she was angry and get her to say or better still shout these reasons one at a time, as she threw the clay onto the floor. Can you see that by doing this, I'd been encouraging Amy to release and act out her anger both physically and verbally. Particularly, when working on a table instead of the floor some children prefer to bash the clay with their hands, in order to express their anger like this. Although, in this case it is important to make sure that they don't hurt themselves. Others like to cut up the clay that represents their anger into small pieces and then energetically throw the pieces away into the garden outside while saying sentences representing their anger such as I'm angry at Mark for crying all the time. Once the child's energy drops and I believe that they've released their anger, I will sit down with them and talk to them about what they have done. I would say, you've done well to get your anger out, congratulations. However, most importantly I will point out to the child that acting out anger in front of other people is not okay, because they won't like it and if we were to do this we would get into trouble. I will then talk to the child about how she or he might be able to act out their anger in a way that won't upset anyone else and won't damage property. For example, the child might be able to go into their bedroom and punch a pillow with their hands while saying what they are angry about. Clearly, in this regard it is useful if the parents are made aware of their child's preferred way of dealing with their anger. I would explain that often when we are angry it is useful to talk to someone else about our anger. In Amy's case, I would ask her whether she felt that she would be able to talk to her mother or father about the reasons why she was angry. I would check out with her whether she thought that this would be useful or whether she thought that his would just get her into more trouble. Next, I would invite Amy to rearrange the sculpture she had made originally of her family into a new arrangement so that everyone in the family was as happy as possible. She might make an arrangement like this. 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I would then comment on what I had observed about the new arrangement and its difference from the previous arrangement. I might say, I noticed this shape representing Mark is no longer on top of your mom and dad, that your mother is close to you and Mark is close to your dad. By feeding back what I've noticed Amy might be able to tell me more about how she felt now. She might even say that she sometimes likes her baby brother and because she is older can teach him things. Finally, I would ask Amy whether she would like to show her sculptures to her mother and father or whether she would like to keep in private. I would try to respect her choice in this naturally, if important information had emerged which the parents needed to know I would tell her that I thought it was important for them to know. For example, in Amy's case, I think that it would be particularly useful for Amy to tell her parents why she has been angry. I would ask whether she would like to do that with me there or whether she would like to me to tell her mother for her, either with her there or not. At the end of the counseling session, I would tell Amy that the clay needed to go back into the big block and would ask her whether she would like me to do this after she had gone or whether she would like to do it herself or whether she would like me to help her. I think that this step in the process is very important, so that the child realizes that these sculptures will not be kept and will not be available in the future counseling session. Generally, I don't let children take clay sculptures home although they frequently ask if they can. My reason for not letting them, take the sculptures home, is that in those instances where I have done this in the past, I found that other members of the family have sometimes undermined the therapeutic value of the work by making unhelpful comments about the sculptures. A big advantage in using clay is that it is a medium which it generally allows the child to feel good about what they've done. Particularly, if the counselor comments positively about their work. 

00:38:20
The relationship between Sadness & Anger 

00:38:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD You will have noticed that in the example that I have chosen, I've explained how clay can be used in particular to help the child to express anger. Clearly, it can be used to represent similar emotions such as resentment, in the way I have explained. Often when counseling children, sadness is a major issue. In this case it can be helpful to get the child to make a sculpture of their sadness. As a counselor, you can feedback to the child what you have observed about their sculpture, so that the child has an opportunity to talk more fully about their sadness. I found that often when a child is sad, they will also be angry and the sadness sculpture may well change into an anger sculpture. When a child is sad through experiencing a loss, if they are able to get in touch with the anger resulting from the loss and to express this, their sadness is likely to diminish. 

00:39:35
Dealing with RESISTANCE 

00:39:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In this lecture, I have described the SPICC process and won by helping a child to release emotions. Sometimes the SPICC process will be interrupted, as there may be a time when a child unconsciously or consciously decides to avoid talking about a painful issue. We call this resistance. We need to recognize that when we encounter resistance that the child is in effect protecting themselves from something they perceive is too hard or frightening. We need to know how to deal with resistance when counseling children, so that more useful work can continue. Imagine in Amy's case that while working in the sand tray and talking about her brother, her non-verbal behavior suggested that she was becoming worried or anxious, as a consequence of high anxiety instead of continuing to talk openly, she might deflect away from her troubling issue and instead engage in playing unproductively with the symbols in the sand tray. It is very tempting for new counselors to pressure a child to continue talking about matters that they are avoiding, but to do this is usually very counterproductive. If we try to pressure a child into the talking about issues that they are not ready to talk, we are certain to raise the child's level of anxiety even further. The child will almost certainly withdraw further, what is worse the child may no longer feel safe in the counseling situation, so the possibility of engaging them in further useful work in minimized. You might then ask what should we do when a child deflect away from talking about important issues. The first step is to raise the child's awareness of the resistance itself. We need to identify the resistance and recognize that the child is protecting themselves from something they perceive is too hard or frightening. If the child can own or acknowledge the difficulty of fear then they can discover new ways of coping. I like to give the child feedback about what I notice and what I suspect the child is finding too difficult or frightening. For example, in Amy's case, I might identify Amy's resistance as being related to her being scared to talk openly about her attitude to her baby brother. I might say to her, I wonder if it might be a bit scary for you to talk about the way you feel about your baby brother. By doing this, I would have validated that child's fear and acknowledge that it is acceptable for her to respond by withdrawing and not talking about it at that time. Paradoxically, once the child has permission to withdraw, they are more likely to continue talking. This is because the child knows that their wish to withdraw will be respected. They then feel safer about continuing. If Amy was able to continue talking, I might ask her what would be the scariest thing that might happen if you did stop to talk about the way you feel about your brother. Amy might reply by saying, "I don't think that mom and dad would like me anymore." That issue could then be explored. However, in some cases the child will be unable be continue talking, in which case it is best to just let the child know that it's okay not to talk if they don't want to and to either draw the session to a close or to select another activity which might help the child continue to tell their story. In the next session with the same child, it is best to go back to the beginning of the SPICC process and to focus on joining with the child and enabling them to start to tell their story from the beginning again. However, to maintain the child's interest it will usually be best to choose a different media so that the issues are approached from a different direction. By helping the child to tell their story in a different way without pressuring them to prematurely disclose worrying material they're more likely to start to trust the counseling process and to feel more able to open up. 

00:44:35
The Tutorial 

00:44:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD If you take part in the tutorial that follows this lecture and is described in the lecture's manual, you will have an experience of working with clay, because of this you may wish to wear cloths, that are both suitable for sitting on the floor and also will not be spoiled by getting clay on them. The tutorial should be useful in helping you to experience, what it is like using clay, because if you ought to be effective in working with children using clay then you will need to be able to feel comfortable yourself when using clay. Once again, I hope that you have enjoyed this lecture and I look forward to discussing in the next lecture ways of working which can help a child to change their thinking and behavior.
