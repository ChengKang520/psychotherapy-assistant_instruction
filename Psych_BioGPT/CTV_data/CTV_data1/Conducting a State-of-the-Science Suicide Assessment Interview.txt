JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hi, I'm John Sommers-Flanagan and I'm a professor in Counselor Education at the University of Montana. It's my pleasure to be here. I'm also the author of several books including Tough Kids School Counseling, Counseling and Psychotherapy Skills in Context and Practice, and the one that we're gonna talk about today Clinical interviewing which has a state of the science chapter on Suicide Assessment Interviewing. And so that's our focus for today. And I hope you guys are ready. Umm… This is both uh… difficult and an exciting topic. I want to say by way of introduction that the content of the workshop includes emotionally provocative material. Uh… It can be really challenging umm… but I also really like to talk about this topic and I know that's a little bit weird. But one of the reasons I like to talk about it is because it's so important. If we don't talk about it, if we don't share our experiences and try to do better at suicide assessment interviewing, we will fail our clients and we don't want to do that. And we don't want those kinds of outcomes. So, I want you to during our time together today, engage in self-care as needed, that might mean some deep breathing, it might mean focusing on some positive pleasant thoughts in your own mind, it might mean that you'll do what a lot of my teenage clients do and that is you can just ignore me. You can… I like it to be pretend like you're listening, but some of my clients will just put their hands over their ears and so if you're doing that, that's okay. So are you ready? Tough topic. Opening story. So, I just want you to imagine this possible scenario. Umm… I'm just cutting to the chase here, I'm not messing around. Let's say you've been working with somebody for five sessions, 10 sessions, maybe 15 sessions. You knew the person was suicidal and depressed and yet nevertheless you get the call that you had dreaded, one morning a family member calls and says that your client with whom you have worked has died by suicide. Now that is going to shake your world, right. That is going to be super upsetting and it should be. Umm… And I've had that experience myself, umm… and it's a terrible experience and I would like it if no one had to have that experience, but in fact suicide completion is a reality. In the world about 12 out of every 100,000 people die by suicide and, uh… that's a very low rate, but if you think about the kind of people with whom we work, survey show. If I were to ask you guys do you know of anyone who has ever worked with someone who has attempted or committed suicide, you would undoubtedly say, yeah, umm… I do. And so we know it's a real problem. The risk and the base rates among clients who come for counseling or psychotherapy is higher than the 12 per 100,000 in the general population. So most of us will have contact with individuals who are suicidal, at a relatively high rate and we know, umm… Before I go on about suicide rates, I also want to do something that I like to do when I'm stressed and it's a difficult topic and so let's intellectualize for a second, together. Umm… Let's think about it, in the history of suicide, 1949, Edwin Shneidman, now called or referred to as the father of suicidology, not sure I would want that title myself. But he was sent on an errand by his boss at the VA to the coroner's office and he found several hundred suicide notes, unopened, in a vault. And he decided, at that moment, not to open them, instead to do some systematic research on them to develop hypothesis before he opened them. So, he didn't read them immediately. And in the process, he discovered a thing called "Psychache." And I'm going to read this, it's a little bit long, I don't usually read slides, but I want everybody, I want us to get a feel for what Shneidman discovered. And the way he articulated it because he was a fabulous author. "In general," he says, "it is probably accurate to say that suicide always involves an individual's tortured and tunneled logic." And I put that in bold, tortured and tunneled logic, important words. "In a state of inner-felt, intolerable emotion." Inner-felt, intolerable emotion. "In addition, this mixture of constricted thinking and unbearable anguish," get the feel for what he is talking about. "Is infused with that individual's conscious and unconscious psychodynamics." And so we've got our psychodynamics, it gets woven in there of hate, dependency, hope, etcetera, playing themselves out within a social and cultural context, which itself imposes various degrees of restraints on, or facilitations of, the suicidal act. Okay. He has captured a lot in those two sentences. Umm… And I think it's really important for us to focus on theory from time to time when we're working with suicidal people because it helps give us a target, it helps us to understand what we should be looking for and what we should focus on. So, Shneidman's theory, is we have this thing called psychache which is that tortured feeling, right, that unbearable anguish, psychache. And it's combined with the thing he called tunneled or torture… tunneled or mental constriction. So, the stress and the pain and the aguish is big and pretty soon the person can see only two choices, to stay alive in unbearable anguish or to terminate one's life. So the person gets stuck in only seeing those two options, mental constriction. That makes sense to you, yes? It's almost like putting blinders on. And then in addition he says, there is this thing called perturbation, which is an agitation. And that that also contributes, like I must do something. I must do something about this situation. And in combination with psychache and mental constriction, perturbation can contribute to uh… death by suicide. Now Thomas Joiner, another person who's written a lot in this area has an interpersonal theory, it's a little different than Shneidman's, but also equally important because it gives us some clues about things to focus on. He says people who commit suicide, who die by suicide have experienced to some extent thwarted belongingness, in other words, they wanted to belong, then we think about choice theory and we think about other theories, Adlerian theory, we know that belonging is so important, right. There's thwarted belongingness and there's a perception that I am a burden, okay. And so those social or interpersonal dynamics also seem to be something that drives the suicide attempt or the death by suicide. Now, when it comes to evaluating and treating people who are suicidal, we have a… what I like to call, a big myth or an old narrative about the way we think about it. And so I'm introducing some, I'm gonna introduce a new narrative or a new way of thinking about it. But the old one is suicide ideation is a sign of deviance. If you have suicidal thoughts, I need to assess, I need to get a no suicide contract, okay. And I need to intervene and prevent suicide that might mean hospitalization or whatever I deem to be necessary. I'm the medical authority or the psychological or the counseling authority and I need to make a decision about you, okay. Much more authoritarian or authoritative than it's now viewed. This is the old medical model, right. Now let's bust it, because it's not the way we operate anymore. Those are, uh… remnants of the past and we don't want to operate that way. I know, I wish I had had this new way of operating back when I lost a client to suicide, because I think this is a better, more effective way of operating. We should not see suicidal thoughts as a sign of de… deviance. They are not a sign of deviance. That's partly because 10% of the human population will attempt suicide, right. So, how could thoughts of suicide and when you think about it, you know, it's a natural thing to struggle with the decision to stay alive and how shall we then live, right. We need to approach life and there are lot of people who have experienced really hard things and sometimes they begin to question whether or not life is worth living. What I am saying is it's natural to have those thoughts. It's not deviant. Also up to 50% of teens are reported being bothered by suicidal thoughts. That's not deviance, right. By definition, deviance has to be unusual. So, why bust the big myth II. If we think suicide ideation represents deviance, people with suicidal thoughts will feel more isolated, right. It's like, if we're in a conversation you say, that you've had suicidal thoughts, I take on my medical authoritarian or authoritative role and I begin assessing you because I think there's some kind of danger, I may be scared myself, all this feeds into you feeling probably more isolated and may be less like you want to talk anymore to me. Okay. If we're scared of suicidal thoughts as practitioners, we convey that message. So, one of my big recommendations to you is let's embrace, this is not a deviance. We should be ready to talk about it. Umm… in addition, another reason why as Marsha Linehan from the University of Washington, she says her research has shown clearly that individuals with… diagnosed with, umm… Borderline Personality Disorder, if they are told not to or they can't think about suicide, it makes them more distressed. It makes them feel worse because the idea of being able to think about suicide can be a relief, right. Just to even think about it, doesn't mean that you're ever gonna act on it, but to be able to think about. Here's the new narrative. Suicide thoughts and gestures don't represent deviance. They're natural, they're normal things that humans think. Suicide thoughts and gestures represent distress, right. They represent that psychache, they represent pain, emotional pain. We need to have empathy with our clients and their distress and collaboratively develop safety plans, not in those suicide contract and there's a big difference. It's the safety plan, it's a collaborative endeavor. One of the problems with the old "No suicide," contract is I might say, well, like you to sign this to say that you won't try to kill yourself. And no matter how genuine and sincere I'm about that, there's a certain amount of it that looks like I'm covering my ass, right. And so it comes across as like, oh, who is this for? Right. But if we make a safety plan, we're collaboratively working on how we're gonna keep you alive and we value that. Now I'm gonna go through, quickly, the Suicide Interview Components, okay. We're gonna through them and then, umm… I'm gonna say that I'm very happy with myself because I have turned this into an acronym. I'd never had done it, but I went to Cincinnati and I did a uh… three hour workshop on suicide assessment and Robert Wubbolding was there. And if you don't know Bob Wubbolding is one of the… he is the premier individual with regard to Choice Theory and Reality Therapy now. And he has made up lots of acronyms. He has WDEP, wanting, doing, evaluating, planning. He's got that on his license plate. And so I knew he was gonna be in the audience. He had told me he was going to attend. So, I developed my own acronym for my suicide assessment protocol. S to the sixth power or RIPSCIP. And, umm… here it is. Suicide risk factors, Suicide ideation, Suicide plan, Self-control, Suicide intent, Safety planning and other suicide interventions. Sometimes I think I'm really funny, I'm really not that funny. But, I get some personal entertainment value out of if, I was so proud and I don't even know for sure that Bob noticed that I had done that especially for him. So, we are gonna go to that first one on the list, RIPSCIP. So it's an R, Suicide Risk Factors. There are many, 25 or more, I have listed in the chapter in the Clinical Interviewing text. We can't go through all of them. Uh… There are also lots of different acronyms to remember them. There is IS PATH WARM. That's one of the, ones that was developed by suicidologists, I think pretty recently, 2011, 2012. Uh… Turns out IS PATH WARM doesn't have depression on it. I… I mean, I… I don't know what they were thinking, but almost all of our efforts to do anything with risk factors fall short. One of my points, they're helpful, but they're just limited in how helpful they are. The SAD PERSON SCALE was also another one where sex, obviously, males commit or die by suicide four times the rate of females on average. Age, depression, okay. So, there the acronym SAD PERSONS was used to, umm… talk about uh… to help people remember suicide risk factors. Really, the big predictors include previous attempt, depression, plus some other agitated feelings, right. A slowed down depressive episode is not necessarily linked to suicidality, but if there's hopelessness and there's sort of this agitated quality to it, perturbation is what Shneidman would say then depression is a big risk. Umm… And veteran status is one of the biggest risks also. Umm… That's really one of the most, uh… significant status variables. Umm… Interestingly culture and ethnicity, uh… if we look at culture and ethnicity, we find that native American teenagers committed higher rates, but native American elders don't, whereas with Caucasian or white populations, we have, umm… higher suicide rates among older people, 60 and older in particular. But then when it comes to African-Americans, African-American women, lowest suicide rate on the planet, okay, very rare. Does that mean that we would then if we're working with the African-American women not think that she is ever gonna be suicidal? Of course not, that's the myth or the problem associated with risk factors. No risk factors really substitute for a good collaborative suicide assessment interview. So now suicide assessment, suicide ideation, we're gonna, umm… have to ask directly. We cannot ask this indirectly. We just have to say, "Have you had some thoughts about suicide?" No. "Have you thought about hurting yourself?" Okay, different. They're both important. Cutting maybe something someone does or racing or burning or branding, right. But that's not the same as a suicide attempt. Often times, cutting is for emotional regulation purposes, whereas suicide is for the cessation of life and suicide attempts are for that purpose. So, the word suicide has to be used, we have to ask directly. Umm… We have to frame the question appropriately. Now here's an example. I'm gonna give you guys the words for this, but you want to use your own words whatever really fits with you because most importantly, you need to have a genuine interaction with your clients. But I will say things like, I ask everyone I meet with about suicide and so I'm gonna ask you, have you had any thoughts about death or about suicide? Okay. I'm making it a normal or natural thing. I'm not gonna act weird or anxious about it. I might say I've read with the teenager, between 10% to 50% of all teenagers have been troubled by thoughts about suicide. Is that the case for you? Have you had some trouble and thoughts about that? Okay. So, I'm gonna right there, I'm gonna frame the question in a way that makes it feel natural and normal. Now earlier, in an earlier lecture I did this and I'm gonna do it one more time, okay. Are you ready? Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being you are just going to kill yourself because you're so depressed. And 10 being you're the happiest you could possibly be. Where would you rate yourself, right now? 

00:17:40
KELLY ANN CHANEY A nine. 

00:17:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A nine. You're still a nine. Now in the last two weeks, what's the lowest rating that you would give yourself? 

00:17:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… Maybe a five. 

00:17:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Maybe a five. What was going on? 

00:17:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY My jump drive got, uh… hit with a virus and all my doctorial stuff got wiped out. 

00:18:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, that would take me to number 2, I'm just saying. You must be naturally resilient. 

00:18:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… The semester was over so that things I don't need any more, but it did bring me down. 

00:18:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And what's the highest you've been in the last two weeks? 

00:18:15
KELLY ANN CHANEY Oh, the highest, probably a 10. 

00:18:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Maybe a 10. 

00:18:15
KELLY ANN CHANEY Yeah. 

00:18:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What was going on then? 

00:18:20
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… I have two girls and their birthdays are week apart, so it's always party, party, it's like. 

00:18:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Big time celebration. 

00:18:25
KELLY ANN CHANEY Yeah. 

00:18:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Nice. So, now one of the reasons that you would do three parts of this is I want to know, I want to try to bind or connect her mood with real life events. This is the foundation of some therapeutic interventions that we might use later. You know, we'll talk about reasons for living as being a protective factor against suicide. And it's clear that she has some connections with her daughters, that are deep and meaningful and joyful for her, okay. And so as we look at this mood rating scale, this is really one of my favorite ways to try to ask about suicide. Because I'll say that, nobody hardly ever says 0, okay. Because most people are not actively suicidal in the moment that they're meeting with me. But then I'm gonna ask back two weeks… I might back… ask back a month or two months to see when they were the furthest down and it gives me some understanding of what brings the person down. And then I'll ask about what… I'll end with the highest rating 'cause I want to end on a positive. And so this is a way to evaluate suicide ideation, I think in a way that's very efficient and can build the foundation for later therapeutic activity. But we also need to know about suicide plans. And I know, you might say, do we have to ask about suicide plans. I would ask that question. And then another solution, focused people would say, no, you don't, yeah, you know, you're gonna stay more focused on positive, why go back and ask about plans for suicide, right. Now this could happen based on your risk factor assessment for… related to previous attempts, right. And previous attempts, the more severe or the more dangerous, the lethal the previous attempt, the higher the current risk. And so, assessing the plan might flow from that, but you also might just have to introduce it. Sometimes when people are down and depressed, they think about how they might kill themselves. I'm wondering if you had any thoughts about that? Okay. Just ask it directly. People will often say, oh, you know, I thought about it, but I don't really want to. And they'll go into the reasons they don't want to. That can be very relieving to you, umm… and it can be informative. But we always SLAP the PLAN. Okay, SLAP the PLAN that means, the specificity. Do you have a specific plan or is it just, ah, you know, a vague thing, like, it might be the difference between, umm… active and passive suicidal thoughts. A passive suicidal thought being, ah, I just, kind of wish I wouldn't wake up some days, okay. Active, I'm gonna kill myself, right. And it's much different. Lethality of the plan, firearms, the most lethal. Umm… Availability of the means, are there firearms available? Are there drugs available? Most people have in their medicine cabinets more than enough to complete suicide. Proximity of social support. You know, so Kelly is telling me about her suicidality and her plan, but is there someone around who might help. Umm… And that can be very important and informative as well. The rest of the SCIP, self control, intent and safety planning. Uh… We're gonna want to know those, there are history of loss of control. We're gonna want to know self-reported sense of control. Do you feel like there is a chance that you might lose control, uh… any particular time when you think that might happen, more or less? Times when you have more control, less control. We're gonna want to know about, umm… intent and reasons for living. You know, lot of people say that they think about suicide, but they don't really want to. And one intervention is to separate the suicidal thoughts from the self. In other words, I'm just trying to get clear, Kelly, is it more that you really want to kill yourself or is it more that you're saying that you want to stop feeling so miserable. If it's more you want to stop feeling miserable, then we have an opening. Let's work on some strategies to help you feel less miserable, more positive. None of these evaluative things replaces the collaborative safety plan. There's a lot written about safety plans, especially recently. I really recommend that you go and you read those things, including some portions of the chapter that I've written on it. But we're heading down the home stretch of this particular lecture, and so I want to get to decision making and a couple of more things and then we'll stop. We have to be sometimes in the position of an authoritative professional who makes a decision about what to do about the suicide. That might mean hospitalization. There is no good formula, right. There is no snappy formula that we can use to make decisions. But we want to look at the frequency, the intensity and the power of the suicide ideation. We do want to look at the specificity and the lethality of the plan. We want to look at other risk factors, but we also want to look at protective factors like reasons for living, okay. And then, responsiveness to interventions. We want to definitely look at, if I talk about separating this, the… the pain from the desire to die, do you go with me on that? Or are you unresponsive to my effort to find something that we can work on together? Developing a safety plan. Are you willing to tell me, uh… what are the times when you're most likely to have the thoughts? What could you do? Who could you call? Are you willing to call 911 or some… not a person you don't know, if you were in the midst of a suicidal crisis, okay. And umm… we want to make and build a really good plan. And then, uh… the last thing is we want a consultant document. You can't do this alone. Let me just say, if you don't remember anything else about anything I said today, remember, don't go here alone. If you're working with suicidal people, you consult because the mind can be a terrible place to go by yourself. It can trigger some really hard and difficult content of your thoughts. It can actually trigger some suicidal thoughts yourself so please talk to each other, that's part of what you ha… that's part of what we have as a mental health professional community. Closing comments. Normalize. Collaborate, it's the connection more than anything. I might use a reality therapy thing and say, I want you to live, okay. Are you willing to work on this together with me? Can we make a good plan? Focus on strengths whenever you can. Consult and document, and for more detailed information, you can see the chapter in my clinical interviewing text, which I think is pretty darn comprehensive, and can be helpful to you in your work with this population. Now I know, I have covered a lot and it's probably stressful and overwhelming to focus that much on suicide assessment interviewing and so thank you for listening and I hope that you guys have some questions. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN I was wondering, umm… as you mentioned it's kind of an emotion producing topic. How would you recommend a beginning counselor to sort of prepare ourselves because most likely we'll be working with clients who are suicidal? 

00:25:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Fabulous question. Umm… And I would say that the first thing is to get comfortable with the topic and you can do that in a number of ways and one way is to read. And I think Edwin Shneidman has great material, Marsha Linehan has great material. I've got the book chapter. But the other thing is there is nothing, no replacement for practice, right. So, I think, with your classmates that you practice suicide assessment interviews and in particular, be sure to practice using the words asking the question on a scale of 0 to 10. The 0 is you're so depressed you're gonna just kill yourself. Okay. Many people have thoughts about suicide, I'm wondering if you have had any thoughts about… thoughts about suicide, so to get your… your tongue around it, in some way, so that you are comfortable saying it. Because it's really important that you believe that it's a natural thing and the sign of distress that you're prepared to work with someone through. And uh… And it's only by practice that you can get to the point of really believing that, otherwise the belief is theoretical. And then the first person who walks into your office who says that she or he is suicidal, will freak you out, right. And so you got to practice it. You got to practice breathing when you say the word suicide. So that's… those are my first ideas, umm… but I would just say, gosh, the more role-plays you can do around the issue, not just asking directly, but around the issue of doing some interventions, uh… creating a safely plan. Yeah, all those things. Important skills to practice. Thank you for that question and other questions? 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:27:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN How would you proceed with a client who attempted suicide? How would you go further with that client? 

00:27:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. Another great question and uh… not an easy question. That is gonna be very stressful, right. I mean, as counselor, you might feel like this is a communication back to you that you're not doing any good. You're not helping me at all. And so, you will have to deal with your own feelings and your own emotions about, umm… about that. I remember a young man I worked with, who did a suicide attempt and it's terrible, devastating, hard, but you know, if you think about it, this is an opportunity too. It's an opportunity for deepening the collaboration. And so that, to me, is the way we have look at it. We have to say, okay, how can I take this and say, all right, now let's talk deeper, let's talk more, let's figure out a… a better safety plan. Let's double our efforts, so that we can be more successful. Umm… And you're gonna need some support. Again, don't be alone in that. So, any other questions? 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN I have one. As a clinical supervisor, how would you help a counselor who has had a client commit suicide and is really feeling the effects of that experience? 

00:29:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Well, umm… as a person who had a client commit suicide, I can speak from some personal, umm… perspective, but also just in general, from the literature. Uh… What helped me the most was having a supervision group, okay. Uh… Group of colleagues, umm… who really surrounded me with support. And without that, I think I would have been much… I was devastated as it was. But I'd be even… I would have been in worse shape. So I would say, as a supervisor, you would guide somebody toward… Who's your support group? Who do you have in the program, whatever program you're in, if it's counseling or psychology or social work? Who do you have who might help and might talk and might support you? Because again, don't go through this alone. And then I would think, in terms of your supervision, you know, we want to think about, well, how are you providing some support, but also how are you doing some teaching. And uh… even though and this is one of those things that as a counselor and a supervisor, in the midst of a crisis or a difficult situation, umm… it's hard to take a step back and say, now, what have we learned from this, okay. But as a supervisor, that's really one of your jobs, right. Let's take a step back and say, what… what have you learned from this? Okay. And I might use some tricky things like uh… may be even a little solution focused assignment, I want you to write me a letter from five years in the future telling me how you learned from this and how it has made you a better counselor. Okay. So I would try to do some things that are little bit therapeutic as a supervisor and we know that that's sort of within the domain of supervision sometimes at a certain level, so. Those were… Those were three great questions, umm… we could talk all day about those, umm… but we do have to stop and so thank you very much for listening. I've… I've enjoyed talking with you.
