DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the important of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in the trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Sometimes we need to cue our minds with both messages and corrective relaxing messages to the body. Two channels definitely works better than one. In this exercise, we will work with the Trauma Treatment Online Program, Breath Trainer Application. You will find the application online at our www.WhatIsPTSD.com site, within the Trauma Treatment Online Program section. You need to log in to your user account to find the breath trainer. If you have an iPhone or an Android, you can also download a copy there as well, just to make it easy for you. Ensure that you're in a safe, quiet place where you will not be disturbed for the duration of this breath training practice. Today's practice is: Breath trainer with safety cues. So, let's practice together. When you download a copy of the breath trainer or view it, at http://www.whatisptsd.com/ site simply or simply watch this video, it's going to be a good opportunity for you to get control, over your breathing practice. Two, I believe that breath is the window into the nervous system and if you are able to settle down your breathing at an early stage of stress, anxiety or fear, you'll have an easier time of managing, life demand and posttraumatic reminders, every single day. Three, the application gives you flexibility over the amount of time you practice. I'll just start with five minutes and use that. The speed is something you can also make slower or faster, start with a pace that feels comfortable and manageable and then slow down, the inhale-exhale by adjusting the slider on the lower-left hand side. Now, just watch and inhale as the ball gets larger and exhale as the ball gets smaller. Allow yourself to receive the messages that you see on the screen. Allow the messages to give a corrected experience in this moment. The breath trainer will now play for three minutes. Just go along with it and allow your body and mind to integrate the experience.
