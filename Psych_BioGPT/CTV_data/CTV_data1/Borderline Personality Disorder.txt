 Welcome to the dialogue on Borderline Personality Disorder. This morning, we have the great fortune of having with us one of the fathers of modern, modern theories on, ah, personality disorder, Dr. Otto Kernberg and in this dialogue with him, ah, Daniel Amen. So, ah, I will, ah, Dr. Kernberg has agreed to go first. I will, ah, turn the mic over to him and then, ah, if there's time at the end of the talk we will have, ah, people come to mics for discussion. In the meanwhile if you will make sure that your, ah, cellphones had been turn down, ah, you will have people look at you with great eye if, if your cellphone goes off. And that now, ah, please join me in welcoming Dr. Kernberg and Daniel Amen.

OTTO KERNBERG Very thankful. Okay, ah, ah, can you hear me in the row? Yeah, is this working? Okay. Uhm, well, uhm, this is a kind of a spontaneous dialogue. We have not prepared anything jointly so, ah, in a way we'll select faces that, ah, seen most relevance and important to us. Uhm, I am-- ah, I direct an, an institute, uhm, for personality disorders that, uhm, in Cornell University Medical College in New York and, uhm, uhm, we have been working with a group colleagues for the last 30 years in trying to study personality disorders, ah, descriptively which like a pathology, theology, and treatment and help develop specific psychoanalytically base, psychotherapy for server personality disorders, ah, that is called transference-focused psychotherapy that has been, uhm, empirically studied and validated in, uhm, at least to three hours it is and, uhm, so we are engage in research, in education, and in, ah, treating patients. Uhm, ah, what I could do is very briefly tell you the main areas in which we are involved in, in, in 12 and all of them of course, there are open questions. Perhaps, one can divide the field into, uhm, descriptive, uhm, psychiatric syndromes, psychopathology, differential diagnosis, etiology, and treatment. I think that's kind of broad enough, uhm, briefly where we stand in all of this areas. Ah, descriptively that description of borderline personality disorder in DSM-IV and DSM-V, uhm, basically corresponds to how we would see the specific constellation of personality disorder, the main symptoms, being a disturbances in personal identity, disturbances in relationship with significant others, uhm, severe alteration and instability of mood with a dominant of strong negative effects, generalize impulsivity, lack of impulse control, and, uhm, general immaturity of emotional relations. There are additional symptoms suicidal and kind of suicidal behaviors, dissociative reactions, uhm, ah, that, that are more symptomatic behaviors rather than in the strict sense part of the personality, that sensual features of the personality I've also got mention before. Now our particular contribution has been to observe and this goes 30 years back that one central disturbance of this patient from which everything else can be derived descriptively is to what we have called the disturbance in identity referring to what Eric, Eric for many years ago describe as a syndrome of identity diffusion, a lack of integration of the concept of self, a lack of integration of the concept of significant others were shows in instability of the view of oneself incapacity to determine one's long range goals, ah, to determine one's commitments, uhm, then of oscillation about oneself esteem from high to very low feelings of emptiness and at the same time, lack of integration of the concept of significant others with a tendency of dividing people to all good or all bad idealizing them or seeing them as potentially a hostile enemies. In other words, the experience of others is divided and, ah, idealize in a persecutory world and that this two central characteristics; lack of integrational self, lack of integrational significant others, we found also in many other personality disorders such as the, uhm, uhm, infantile histrionic that paranoid to the narcissistic, antisocial, uhm, uhm, the schizo-- the schizotypal. Ah, in most personality disorders, the DSM-IV, DSM-V description and some other steps were lift out of the description. Uhm, in contrast to other personality disorders that did not show this and those of a patient is generally functioning much better, ah, that includes the obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality, hysterical personality, the depressive masochistic personality, and we describe those better functioning personalities that had rigidities in their behavior that had personality disorders in the sense of rigidification of their habitual behavior pattern that limited their capacity to adjust their own needs and to the needs of other patient. In other words, restricting the flexibility of the freedom of individual. That's common characteristic of or personality disorders. Those that maintain an integrated identity, we called neurotic personality organization in contrast to borderline personality organization, not borderline personality disorder, is that severe type of personality organization with identity diffusion and for which we developed a specific kind of treatment. Uhm, we have proven right in that it was demonstrated that the severe personality disorder have become comorbidity with at least one and probably several of over 60% so that, uhm, ah, that identity diffusion is general mark of severity of personality disorder gradually has become generally recognize that is now included in the new classification proposed as classification for DSM-V, uhm, in, in which the severity of any personality disorder is decided by the pathology of the self concept and of the relation with significant others. That's in a nutshell what I would say about descriptive psychopathology. Regarding, ah, underlying deeper psychological structure, we found that these patients suffer from a predominance of severe negative affix rage and that irritation, hatred, envy discussed, uhm, a negative effects that can be subsided with a general concept of aggression, a predominance of, of conflict around the tense aggression that shows in their behavior toward others into itself and that is shocked and dissociated from search from idealize relationships to escape from that, uhm, problem of being submerge in a world of hostility and fear, and rejection. So their internal life had an idealized segment of experience into persecutory segment of experience which are split between them that showed in split of their representational self, split in their representation of significant others. In primitive defensive mechanisms help them to try to protect themselves against the activation of this negative interactions, uhm, defensive operations that can maybe familiar with, ah, projective identifications, split in denial, omnipotent control evaluation, uhm, different from the defense mechanisms of the neurotic personalities that were mild, ah, and not observable in ordinary behavior. Defensive operation of the severe personality disorder can be seen into action. Etiology, where does all of this come from? Of course, here this, a bond on research and we have been very open to being alert to and incorporating the findings throughout the research carried out in this country and other country, in Europe, and, uhm, uhm, there is no evidence that there is a combination of causes of diff-- different importance in each patient. Uhm, there are genetic dispositions to, uhm, excessive development, ah, of, uhm, negative effects, uhm, there's evidence for, ah, genetic, uhm, uhm, predisposition to, ah, failure in, ah, a transported gene, uhm, of serotonin, one of the basic, uhm, affects determining neurotransmitters, ah, the serotonergic system in real-- in, in general has a kind of a calming function that here is decreased with a tendency of hyperreactivity, particularly negative hyperreactivity which shows in temperament from birth onwards. So there's a temperamental disposition, I'm simplifying. Second, there's a bond on evidence that abnormal attachment has an important ideological feature and the mechanism of normal attachment is by, ah, a lack of attunement and, and, uhm, congruence between mother-infant reaction. There's an excessive build up on negative affect, again, it's an important cause for buildup of negative effect. Then there is abundant evidence that, uhm, a borderline personality disorder, uhm, is, uhm, related to, uhm, severe trauma, severe sexual abuse, physical abuse, chronic witnessing of sexual and physical abuse, of, of normal parenting chaotic unpredictably family behavior and, uhm, ah, so that psychological, psychosocial causes are probably is or more important than genetic dispositional one that show in temperament and they reinforced each other because once pathological de-- behavior develop, the response of the environment, uhm, creates visual cycles and redevelop a general theory of development based upon psychoanalytic object relations theory by which the basic units of subjective psychic experience are constituted by representations of self related through representation of others derive from the affective intense moments that the affects states in which the individual is involved in significant others that are internalize is affective memory and then a buildup in an idealize of persecutory segment of all good representation of self related to representation of others or all bad representation of self relation to others. On this basis of self which we talk about descriptive dynamic, neurologic aspects. On this basis, we develop a particular type of treatment. The treatment consist in permitting the primitive split of dissociated dispositions of this patients to become activated in the relations with a therapist what is called transference within psychodynamic, uhm, approaches. In other words, the unconscious activation of pathogenic experiences from the past in the present relation with the therapist facilitated by the fact that the therapist is very open to the experiences that, uhm, invites the patient to freely express all the feelings, memories, wishes, fears in the relationship, ah, with a degree of enormous tolerance for whatever comes up limited by creating a clear boundary of what is possible in the treatment, was not boundary that protects the patient, that protects the treatment from excessive violent aggression that might destroy the treatment. And in that context, the treatment consists in helping the patient become a well of the activation of this idealize and persecutory relationships in which the patient unconsciously-- it identifies not only with one aspect of this dynamic relation between self and other but typically, at time with self while projecting the other onto the therapist and to times with the other while he projecting the self onto the therapist. For example, the patient was severely traumatized, I'm not talking about post traumatic stress syndrome but trauma that increases con-- chronically than negative segment of experience and, and determines this tremendous predominance of the negative, uhm, ah, negative segment of emotional experience split off from an idealize one. On the normal conditions, in the first few months of life, in the first, ah, few years of life, there is such a tendency, normal tendency on the part of babies to divide the world into all good or bad one with the normal predominance of a good experience, gradually that seals over gets integrated modulated but with severe predominance of the negative segment that's not possible. Therefore, the sharp split that determines identity diffusion. So in the treatment, we permit the activation of positive and negative relationships and gradually increase the tolerance of the patient and bring them together. I am in the briefest way one might say that for example if patient who has been severely traumatized, repeats the experience in the treatment, feels himself being a victim and the therapist becomes the perpetrator and the patients feels abused, persecuted, mistreated by the therapist, and the same patient 15 minutes later, may become aggressive and violent, and without being aware of it, identifies with a perpetrator while projecting the victim's status unto the therapist. And what the therapist does is help the patient understand that both these entities are really part of what the has been his mind, permits the patient to familiarize himself with this identification with an internal dangerous terrible relationship that is trying to externalize. By the same talking, at moments of idealization whether patients sees the therapist doesn't go to-- his goin' to protect him and the patient is like well taken care of baby which also reverse and sometimes the patient, in the grandiose way protects the poor little therapist. We help the patient become a well fetch split of segment and then help the patient become a well-- always trying to permit to, to maintain an idealize segment to avoid the overwhelming nature of being overwhelmed by the negative ones. That in a nutshell is the strategy of the treatment, uhm, call it transference-focused psychotherapy, one of the treatment approaches through borderline patient and let me say immediately that's the others very effectively approaches. Uhm, one can divide them into cognitive behavior one, particularly DBT and most effective treatment for this patients and also, uhm, ah, frame therapist, schemas therapist-- therapy for this patients and Beck's Cognitive Therapy, they are effective although DBT is the one that has most empirical evidence. And on this psychodynamic side, in addition to transference-focused psychotherapy, that is supportive psychotherapy base on psychoanalytic principle and metallization based therapy which tends to increase the patients awareness of experience of self and other increase metallization and to some extent corresponds to le-- early stages of transference-focused psychotherapy and there is empirical evidence that all these treatments work at least, ah, in terms of, uhm, empirical research, uhm, RCTs carried out of a period a year, two years that demonstrate their effectiveness for reducing symptoms, the anxiety, the depression, dissociative reaction need for hospitalization with somatizations, uhm, that, that these patients experience with differences. Uhm, DBT and transference-focused psychotherapy are more effective to deal with suicidal and kind of suicidal, ah, behaviors than supportive psychotherapy. The more structured the treatment, the better it helps the patient. But in any case, what is als-- what long range study of these patients are shown is that while their symptoms improves, the big, let's say impoverishment of the personality that does not improve over period. We have follow ups up to 18 years and, uhm, uhm, particularly carried out by the Boston group eclip-- the, the ECLIPSE study on major, uhm, leadership in the field has been under someone's sovereign in that regard. And transference-focused psychotherapy focus is not on particular symptoms but on the basic lesion of the personality, the split between idea-- idealize and persecutory segment. Uhm, at the same, we are interested to study to what extent either genetically determined. What very early determined alteration of the central nervous system, very fundamental function in controlling that affective distortion, lack of impulse control of this patients and to what extent the, the treatment that we're carrying out is modifying this distortion within the functioning of the central nervous system within the functioning of the brain. Uhm, we-- in our studies in that regard, we found that borderline patient in contrast to controls to hyperactivity of the amygdala, important center of the limbic system that controls the activation of negative affect in both anxiety and raging. Different portions of the amygdala, on the one hand and the prefrontal cortex and the anterior po-- part of the cingulum that, uhm, tend to contextualize affect, uhm, in terms of the total experience of the individual that it point, uhm, control affect, uhm, and uhm, have a kind, ah, ah, a controlling, uhm, framing-- cognitive framing of affects and we discover that borderline patients have a hyperactivity of the amygdala, excessive activation of negative affect and the primary inhibition of the function of prefrontal cortex and cingulum. And that with treatment, this reaction is reversed with a decrease of the hyperactivity of the amygdala and an increase of the control function, uhm, of the prefrontal, uhm, ah, prefrontal periorbital cortex and anterior part of the cingulum. Uhm, this is research at present going on and of course, there are other brain functions that are alerted in borderline patients. Uhm, I received a (inaudible ) have shown how other, ah, brain centers are involved in the negative hyper alertness on vigorous, stimulus-- stimuli and, uhm, ah, tendency to interpret as negative, ah, ambiguous neutral stimuli in contrast are in normal population. Uhm, so future, what are open questions? Uhm, to what extent can we better understand and relate the neurobiological determinants of both normal and abnormal behavior and the psychological organization of experience under the influence of interaction between, ah, neurobiology and environment that constitute a second layer of organization, basic layer of organization. There would be a logical second layer, a psychological one to what extent do this two layers interact to determine final descriptive behavior and, uhm, interaction with the environment. That's one general important conceptual issue to understand better interaction between neurobiological and psychological determinants of behavior. They are leading scientist to a working, uhm, in that regard, ah, concept, ah, neuroscientist in this country always made very important advances on affective neuroscience. The United States, they have taught in, ah, Germany who has been studying, uhm, the determination of the self experience by the coordinated integration of about eight different, uhm, module, uhm, uhm, of the brain and the neutral influence between psychological treatment of self pathology and, uhm, ah, it changes in the central nervous. I think that's of interest in, into the main questions is to what extent can we really develop treatment that change the personality that long-term impoverishment, ah, that shows in remaining lonely, not getting involved in couples, not being able to be promoted at work, not being ambitious that the, the kind of burn out that remains even with a best treatments that we have nowadays, that's a task for the future. So these are the issues I'm very interested. Where you stand through? What you-- your contributions are and, uhm, so I'm, I'm looking forward to that. 

00:26:25
 Thank you so much.

00:26:30
DANIEL AMEN You know, I appreciate your work and so as you been doing this for 30 years, 30 years when I was a student and I'd listen to you and over the last 22, we've built this database of 85,000 scans on people from 93 countries and we get the difficult people who come through our clinics and how we conceptualize personality disorders is we always are looking at four circles of their lives. So we look at the biology and imaging helps us with the biology but it's never just biology, we're also looking how they think, what developmental issues they are in. I know that's very important to you. There also social issues and when I think of the spiritual issues, where's the deep meaning and purpose in their lives. The problem with our field and especially the DSM whatever version. It's, it's based on any underlying neuroscience and so because of that, there is a lack of trust in among our colleagues about what we do. Uhm, and so for those people who don't know - 

00:28:05
OTTO KERNBERG Okay. 

00:28:05
Brain SPECT >Single photon emission computed tomography >Measures brain blood flow see areas that work well, low and high >Database 85,000 scans on >50,000 patients with detailed clinical information Healthy Surface and Active View Underactive Overactive 15F Cutter, Dramatic, Unstable Relationships, Failed Multiple Meds and Treatments Baseline Concentration 

00:28:10
DANIEL AMEN - and I only had a couple of slides. The study we do is SPECT which is been around for very long time. Uhm, single photon emission computed tomography, it looks a blood flow and, ah, among our 85,000 scans, we have about 800 borderline patients. And here is someone who's not yet but is on her way to being borderline. She's a 15-year-old who's a cutter, she's dramatic, she's very unstable relationships, she failed multiple medications, multiple treatment centers, and she comes to us. And the image on the left is her brain at rest and the image on the light-- right is what happens when she concentrates. And at rest there's, uhm, low activity in her right prefrontal cortex or orbital prefrontal cortex as you mention. There's also some decreased activity in her left temporal lobe and, for me, in my experience with borderline personality, it tends to be three findings; decrease prefrontal cortex so the impulse control issues, decrease typically in the left temporal lobe. Usually the anterior medial temporal lobe where the amygdala is and then, hyperactivity in the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus and I think of the anterior cingulate, uhm, is the brain's gear shifter. It sort of let you go from thought to thought, move from idea to idea, be flexible, go with the flow. Allan Mirsky when he was at NIMH talked about it as that's one of the main areas where you shift the tension and so they got stock on the things. So clearly my experience with borderline have trouble letting things go, have this dark evil awful thoughts, and then, have trouble supervising them. But the interesting thing about this scan in this girl that was also suicidal is when she concentrates, her brain deactivates so what is happening? That sort to mean the harder she tries the worst it gets and when you look at her neuropsychological and educational testing, she scores when an IQ of 94 and she's in a college prep school. And if her brain is always deactivating and she comes from highly accomplish parents, she gets demoralized because she can't activate her own brain to use it properly and there is this constant sense that she's less that other people. And I went-- I wonder if I can fix this cuz that sort of what my work is about, understand your brain within those four circles and then see if you can change their brain and in that process help them live more effective lives. 

00:31:40
3 Days Later ... Stimulant, HBOT, Supplements ... Her Brain Can Respond! Conc. Before Conc. After Tx 15F Cutter, Dramatic, Unstable Relationships, Failed Multiple Meds and Treatments Baseline Concentration 

00:31:40
DANIEL AMEN And so, uhm, I put around a stimulant, put it on hyperbaric chamber, and gave her some simple supplements and three days later, we rescan and we found that her brain in fact could activate. But I, I want you to think about what happens if your brain turns off when it should turn on and we have a large normal group of people that when they try to concentrate, they typically got activation in their frontal lobes. If your brain turns off when it should turn on, you then do things to turn it back on and one of the things that we found is people use negativity to turn it on. They become not excitement seeking drama driven. They also become conflicts seeking. So if I have a loving thought about my wife, I mean that sort of nice and it's peaceful. If I have a hateful thought about her, that will totally turn on my brain and so when see the idealization and devaluation, both of them are sort of excitement seeking drama driven paradigms. And Betty, my patience for many years ago, thought me that she would come in and she would be diagnosed borderline personality disorder and every session, she start with the most awful way, she was going to kill herself and then one day, it hit me. She was using that as her stimulant and when we scanned her, she had low activity in her frontal lobe and when I stimulated it, she started, "You stop using the negativity." 

00:33:40
3 Days Later ... Stimulant, HBOT, Supplements ... Her Brain Can Respond! Conc. Before Conc. After Tx 6 Months Later ... Straight As, Stable Relationships, Psychotherapy More Effective To get Dr. A's slides, TEXT your name and email to (949) 220-0891 Healthy Brain Happier Healthier More loving Wiser More effective More successful Unhealthy Brain Sadder Sicker Troubled relationships Less wise Less effective Less successful 

00:33:45
DANIEL AMEN So, uhm, for this girl, six months later, straight as stable relationships psychotherapy was more effective, ah, I have never oppose to psychotherapy. I'm just opposed to psychotherapy with brains that aren't fully optimize because then its stressful for the patient and it doesn't work and it's really stressful for me because I really like it when it works. Uhm, with a healthy brain, people are happier, healthier, more loving, more successful. You know, in all those success book you ever read, nobody ever talks about the physical health of your brain. When your brain is not healthy for whatever reason and, and I would be interested to know cuz I just don't know the research and the incidents of traumatic brain injury in borderline personality disorder. I would suspect it would be high if your relationships are unstable and you're really impulsive and, ah, your frontal lobes got hurt at some point or what about toxic exposure or infections. Toxoplasmosis has now been significantly correlated with suicide so wonder and if you never look at that their brain, you actually never know. 

00:35:10
BPD Sxs and the Brain 1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment 2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation -- ADHD 3.Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self -- Right PFC 4.Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., substance abuse, binge eating, and reckless driving) -- PFC 5.Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior -- TLs 6.Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) 7.Chronic feelings of emptiness 8.Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights) -- TLs 9.Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms -- TLs BPD and ADHD >Associated with ADHD (Davids and Gaspar 2005) >ADHD early stage of BPD (Step) >ADHD is a risk factor - OR 13.2 (Miller 2008) >ADHD/BPD 49% correlation of genetic factors (Distel 2011) >11% ADHD with comorbid BPD (Speranza 2011) >38% BPD with comorbid ADHD (Ferrer 2010) 

00:35:10
DANIEL AMEN Uhm, to Dr. Kernberg did a beautiful job of going through the symptoms and as I went through the DSM-V and I'm thinking there a lot of ADHD symptoms and in fact, just go through this, uhm, ADHD has been associated with bipolar disorder. Uhm, some people think it's actually in early stage. It's clearly a risk factor. When you look at the odds ratio, it increases the risk 13 fold. That's impressive. Uhm, they're both have generic factors. They're certainly comorbid with each other. Uhm, its 11% of people with ADHD according to one study, comorbid borderline personalities were 38% of people with borderline personality disorder with comorbid ADD. And so the research shown ADD or ADHD and I'll just take this little side bar, I hate the name ADHD, it was big mistake, ah, because DSM-III, ADD with or without hyperactivity. So it was really clear there were these two disorders and they're very different. DSM-III-R, they switch it to ADHD highlighting the hyperactive component, that was furious, because I'm like will you just throw away, all the girls will had it. And DSM-IV, they realize the errors of their ways but guys, you know, on this committees don't know how to say they're sorry and they turn-- change the name to AD/HD. Now, what the hell is happening? It means half of the people who have it are never hyperactive. Anyways, uhm, so the ADD still comes out in my language. 

00:37:15
BPD and Amen Clinics Database (n=117) Increased >L/R Anterior/Middle/Posterior Cingulate >L/R caudate and insula >L anterior temporal pole >L/R amygdala, hippocampus >L/R thalamus To get Dr. A's slides, TEXT your name and email to (949) 220-0891 

00:37:15
DANIEL AMEN Uhm, when we look at 117 cases what we saw significant increases in the anterior cingulate so what does that mean? Our experience with borderline personality disorders worried, rigid, and flexible things don't go their way. They get upset and they can't stand it. On the surface, they appear selfish but they're really not selfish, they're rigid, and there's a big difference because one is a judgmental, ah, response. The other one is you feel sorry for them as they just aren't flexible. Hyperactivity in the cingulate gyrus has been associated with low levels of serotonin and serotonergic drugs can help but I would argue, don't get borderline serotoner-- serotonergic jug-- drugs to start because they also have, uhm, increase activity in the caudate which is interesting, the left anterior temporal pole so very close to where the amygdalas and that's why we start with anticonvulsants because of the emotional storms and we find that they help and then an SSRI and the stimulant. So it's those-- that's the cocktail we have used in the context of psychotherapy and family therapy because borderline personality disorders wear their families out. All of you I think know that. So, so these were our findings, uhm, we're really excited about the future of psychiatry and the future of psychiatry is going to, you know, if I was medical student today, I absolutely go into psychiatry. Why? Because we have-- we're profession that has the most room for growth. Ah, that what we're gonna find 20 years from now is we will be imaging all of our patients. You know, cardiologist won't have anything on us but just because there's a biological base and no way does that diminished the mind and the need for great psychotherapy. So once you optimize physical brain function, it still needs the proper, ah, discipline and the proper programming is not quite the way it were but its what's coming in my mind and we're gonna be using social interventions and spiritual interventions. You know, psychiatry is a field that sort to hates that stuff right, ah, but I went to Oral Roberts University and I learn psychiatry sort of in the context of spirituality and, I don't know, what is it, 78% of Americans had deep rooted spiritual beliefs and I think if you don't understand their beliefs system, that you don't understand them, and you with-- will not full help them integrate because people who go to church or go to a synagogue and have those beliefs tend to get better, faster, and I just think it's important to honor that even if it's not in the new book that just came out last week and I'm pretty excited about. Uhm, and ho-- how we described the faith apart was why do you care? What does your life mean? And clearly, one of my friends who's a spiritual teacher, uhm, who before she had her epiphany, uhm, we clearly mean the criteria for borderline personality disorder. She raged, ah, valued people, ah, had an eating disorder and then alcohol abuse, multiple marriages, and in 1986, she woke up on the floor of a halfway house and really-- and realized when she believed her thought she suffered and when she didn't believe her thoughts, she didn't suffer. So her name is Byron Katie and she's written this lovely book called Loving What Is which I highly recommend cuz I think of it is the most elegant form of cognitive therapy as much I love Aaron Beck. Some of that stuff is complicated and hard. First stuff is really easy but I scanned her 20 years later and she clearly had the brain of a murderer. Low frontal lobe activity, low temporal lobe activity but clearly she was now a psychologically healthy driven motivated person. So just because, you have troubled biology doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have a troubled life because of some of those are there circles can help. Just one more thinking, uhm, just one more thought that deactivation is really the idea I wanted to highlight with you that if people's brain deactivate, they unconsciously try to turn it back on and they often do it idealizing you and then hating you. And then idealizing you and then hating you again. And so if you missed the fact that they may have ADD which is that's the classic pattern for ADD and our research but also Allen Matkins(ph), Joel Lubar and other people. So fairly healthy at rest drops with concentration, if, if you missed that, it's going to be much harder to treat them. 

00:43:45
 All right. Ah, at this point, would you, gentlemen, have any questions for each other or any comments that you care to make? 

00:43:55
OTTO KERNBERG Well, uhm, I, I think that, ah, you have suggested a number of very interesting areas. First of all, ah, I think you stretch the importance of doing research implying SPECT as a method for studying brain functioning. Uhm, I think that's a, a very interesting and perhaps, a promising way to clarify further, uhm, ah, the pathology of brain functioning in borderline patients and to study possibility that changes with treatment that may show in studies with SPECT. Ah, I don't know, at this point, systematic comparison of borderline patients in normal pop-- populations with SPECT so I trust that you have going to develop that research. I'm going to polish it. Ah, we have been working with, uhm, fMRI. All our research, ah, our neuroimaging that utilizes fMRI, ah, under the leadership first of, ah, Dr. Silbersweig, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard and has, ah, been directing our, uhm, neuroimaging study of the major RCT that we did some years ago and, ah, B. J. Casey who is now the director of our neuroimaging studies so we are not planning to do SPECT studies but I think it's a very important instrument and, and is missing so far in the literature in terms of systematic comparison. Uhm, regarding, uhm, - 

00:45:35
 Ah, can I... 

00:45:35
OTTO KERNBERG - the effect-- ah, regarding what you said about treatment, uhm, we have been, ah, very interested in two major aspects. One, the study of functioning of patients in concrete events. Uhm, we are planning-- this is a mix research effort to relate changes that occur with analysis of transference development in the session, in comparison to how patients deal, ah, with their relationships outside the sessions using, uhm, ah, the registration, uhm, ah, ah, using the advance spe-- specific programs to reach the reactions to immediate events and correlating them with the changes that we observed in the psychotherapy session as one method to study... 

00:46:35
DANIEL AMEN So, you're gonna have apps for that . 

00:46:40
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:40
DANIEL AMEN I love that. 

00:46:40
OTTO KERNBERG And, ah, a major emphasis has been, ah, the three major areas of human functioning that tend to be neglected in traditional, uhm, psychothe-- therapeutic endeavors. How patient functions in relationship through work and profession? How they function in relationship to love and sex? How they function in relationship to their social contacts, friendships, and creativity? And we are not talking simply whether the patient is employed or not but what's the degree of effectiveness of work? How does it relate to level of education, ah, ah, to ambitions, to relationship with superior and subordinates? Ah, uhm, what is the capacity of the patient to develop intimate relations man-- in the maintained formed to, to integrate eroticism and tenderness, ah, in contrast to maintaining split or severe inhibition in some of this areas to what extent, ah, are the relationships capacity for intimacy as well as autonomy increasing? So, ah, the search on pinpointing where the patient is now, ah, in those of the areas and how he changes with treatment, ah, are a very practical immediate concern. I agree that there's spiritual dimension. In other words, uhm, a dimension dealing with the importance of ethical values both as an expression of, uhm, intimacy and commitment to relationship and work and, uhm, as a high level of, uhm, autonomy in terms of value assistance that, ah, depend on the internal sense of morality and not on conventional adaptation through the environment. Uhm, I agree that these are important dimension that have not been consider sufficiently psychotherapy and we'll building them in our next research projects. So it seems to me that what you have to have offer is one more instrument, uhm, and we have to use the number of roads to learn how the brain is functioning. SPECT, maybe one, uhm, fMRI studies, in other words, MRIs studies under the affect of specific, ah, positive and negative stimuli are another one. Uhm, the study of, uhm, uhm, neuropsychological functioning, ah, maybe providing, ah, very sharp and precise analysis of the functioning for example of the prefrontal cortex instruments such, ah, uhm, Wisconsin, ah, test, uhm, for cognitive analysis that commits starting, uhm, prefrontal functions in, in milliseconds, uhm, ah, may provide a functional analysis, ah, of, of the brain and specialized neuropsychological test that, that will give us more detail information that the relatively grows one that we can get right now because after all both SPECT and, and, ah, fMRI show us modern theory, high or low areas of brain functioning but, uhm, ah, ah, uhm, ah, difficult to assess in terms of long range changes of capabilities. Ah, for example relationship amygdala and prefrontal cortex, 

00:50:30
DANIEL AMEN So, so think of fMRI as very fast snapshot this moment in time. Think of SPECT as a long snapshot, so that's more to state of the brain at that moment in time. That's one of the reasons that we like - 

00:50:50
OTTO KERNBERG Yes. 

00:50:50
DANIEL AMEN - SPECT but SPECT has its problems, fMRI there's no radiation, SPECT, it's a nuclear study like path so there is, so you can't do six. I, I'd might argue that like cardiologist, we should be looking at the electrical activity of the brain. We should be looking at the blood flow pattern to the brain. And, and my hope for DSM-VI as it didn't seen much change with DSM-V. I don't think it really had any big practical impact on my practice, uhm, except the ADHD changed. They changed its symptoms by 12 as supposed to symptoms by seven and that's actually very important for the 7-year-olds who are not hyperactive because they may actually there are not hyperactive in their brain. They may not show symptoms to later but I'm hoping with six that we go beyond the diagnosing by symptom clusters which is exactly how they diagnose Lincoln in 1840. Ah, I'm not happy about this. You know, talking to people, looking at people, giving them a psychiatric diagnosis. Ah, uhm, ah, I think that hurts us as a field. So I'm hoping with six, its-- you'll have borderline symptoms because it's real, right, and it devastate people's lives. You'll have the symptoms and then in the next column, you'll go what's the brain function. And then in the next column, what's the underlying genetic markers? And then, you come up with a diagnosis of borderline personality with low temporal prefrontal and high cingulate cuz I ain't guarantee you not 100% a borderline personality disorders will have what we think of whatever we would agree is the classic borderline pattern in the brain. It's like not everybody who's depressed is gonna have the same pattern but you see the problem, if you have the symptoms that have many different combinations of roads to the symptoms, then whatever beautiful treatment program whether it's transference base psychoanalysis or DBT will never work in large scale studies because we have to appreciate the individual genetic and brain variations that get to that. So that's my hope for with and, and hopefully, it's time, you know, it's, it's time, ah, with DSM-VI whenever that is 10 years from now that will add those other categories so they'll-- we'll, we'll be able in a consistent replical-- ra-- radical way to say this is a better way to diagnose people.

 Ah, we have five more minutes so, ah, perhaps we can have maybe, ah, three, maybe four people from the audience that like to ask questions.

 Hi there. Thank you very much for-- it would a great presentations. I just wanted to point out, uhm, minimally, most of, ah, patients with borderline personality disorder also have PTSD at least 60% conservatively in the studies. I just wanna to notice that there are numerous therapeutic modalities that can actually quickly and effectively help with the PTSD things like EMDR, hypnosis, energy psychology techniques, sensory motor and other body based techniques. Some of the fMRI data - 

00:54:35
 All right. 

00:54:40
 - suggest--- some of the the F-- fMRI data suggest that, ah, people's prefrontal cortex goes off line during traumatic reactivation and some of these of alternative can quickly bring it back on mind. I wanted to know either of the two centers have a comment on that. 

00:55:00
 Ah, Dr. Kernberg. 

00:55:00
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah. Ah, I would like, ah, you to, ah, summarize the question to me. I have a hearing difficulty and particularly sensitive to the micro-- to the wavelength of microphones so I have difficulty in hearing question. If you-- I should have said that at the beginning, if you will, if you can come, privately, just summarize the question to me, it would be helpful. 

00:55:20
 Yes, and, ah, ah, if I understand you question correctly, you said there are certain treatments that have been shown with fMRI studies to produces, ah, quick results. 

00:55:35
 Clinically, there are several alternative techniques including hypnosis. 

00:55:40
DANIEL AMEN Let me do that - 

00:55:40
OTTO KERNBERG Yeah. 

00:55:40
DANIEL AMEN - since I'm right here. 

00:55:40
OTTO KERNBERG Go ahead. 

00:55:40
DANIEL AMEN The, the question was there a lot of borderline patients who have PTSD and there are certain quick treatments for PTSD such as EMDR and hypnosis. 

00:56:00
OTTO KERNBERG Hypnosis. 

00:56:00
DANIEL AMEN Uhm, fMRI studies have shown that-- and SPECT, with regards to SPECT-- study with SPECT and the EMDR - 

00:56:10
OTTO KERNBERG Yes. 

00:56:10
DANIEL AMEN - and shows that it when they bring up the trauma, it drops their frontal lobes but after the treatment they come back on what? So that was the question for your comment. 

00:56:25
OTTO KERNBERG Uhm, regarding the relationship with the treatment of, uhm, PTSD and, uhm, borderline personality disorder, general and severe personality disorders. Severe trauma is one of the theological features of borderline personality disorder. There's evidence for that. But clinically, one has to differentiate whether the individual has syn-- has a symptoms of the PTSD which, is, ah, very concrete, uhm, syndrome that emerges six months to year after the or within six months or a year after the trauma and those symptoms may persist two or three years. And the treatment is the treatment for PTSD which is, ah, in effect as you pointed out a brief concrete treatment with amidst to relieve the traumatic situation in the controlled, safe environment that permits to rather become to terms with it. Uhm, that's different from trauma acting as an etiological factor of severe personality disorder bringing about profound splits within the personality structure, ah, where the total personality has been effective they are PTSD no longer, uhm, is the treatment of choice. Those are cases that need long-term intensive treatment whether it's cognitive behavior one or psychodynamic. In the course of that such treatment, ah, the traumatic experience may be re-experience and should be dealt with differently according to whether the treatment approach is a cognitive behavioral one or, uhm, ah, or is a psycho dynamic one. Typically, in the psychodynamic approach to such patients. For example a patient who has been severe, ah, let's say a woman was been severely traumatized sexually in her early childhood. In the middle of the treatment, this may be reactivate as part of transference developments and then the patient may experience herself as the victim of the potential sexual assault by the therapist, ah, who is in the role of the perpetrator so that relationship has to be highlighted as deactivation of, ah, of a frightening, traumatizing past that need to ex-- be explore in all its detailed, ah, of the assumed reaction of both participants. Typically, we find that if the past traumatic situation indeed, has been an important etiological features, we find that double identification and before we know it, the, the patient behaves like a perpetrator and, ah, a seductive aggressive perpetrator of which the therapist is, is, ah, experience himself as victim and that need in term to be interpret as part of the activation of the same relationship so that patient's unconscious tolerance of identifying with victim and perpetrator in the context by and another part of her, she realizes that the therapist is somebody who is trying to get her out that internal nightmare, uhm, is the therapeutic approach which is different from usual, ah, ah, treatment approaches to PTSD. 

01:00:00
 Dr. Amen, would you care a comment? 

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:10
DANIEL AMEN Uhm, so as when I put up this slide on what we found in 117 bipolar patient are borderline patients. It shows basically a diamond pattern in the brain. What we see on scans? Increased anterior cingulate thalamus basal ganglia in both sides, so we correlated that with PTSD and in our work with EMDR, we, we saw initially and heightened it during the first, ah, EMDR session where they were reliving the trauma but then afterwards ended up settling it down. So, so we're very excited about trauma treatment however somebody who has a long standing personality disorder dealing with the traumas absolutely essential and one of the things we really have been talk about, if you been severely abused as a child, odds are somebody has also picked you up and thrown you against the wall, so the incidence of traumatic brain injury in borderline personality disorders in our experience is very high and your temporal lobe, so we've talked about the amygdala sit right behind the lesser wing of sphenoid bone which in human skull is often very sharp. And so what you'll see with head trauma is damage to the temporal lobes and damage to the frontal lobes and unfortunately, if you never look at the brains of these patients, you've missed that they have TBI or traumatic brain injury pattern which when patients and this is one of the things that hooked me on scans in 1991 when I started wondering them, is I would take a person who was severely emotionally disable. They hated themselves. They didn't trust psychiatry because we were making symptom based diagnosis. They would see their scan and almost immediately shame and stigma would mount and they began to see their problem as a medical problem rather than a character problem. I mean personally, I've just never been a big fan of access to just because of my own experience and training, because what, what access to sort of means to many therapist is you are really difficult and you're not likely to get better and it's not my fault, your fault. And so I've never been a fan of, of the-- but when we could show them their scans, they would then become more and gage in the treatment both more compliant with medicine and lifestyle changes and more compliant with the psychotherapy, because they develop this thing I called brain envy. They would want a better brain so I think Freud completely got it wrong with penis envy. Unlike now, that's not word should be. It should be with brain envy, right? The better brain, better life and, you know, it's like-- and Freud tried right? It was 1895 in the project of for scientific psychology, he tried. He was a neurologist. A lot of people don't remember that but Freud was a neurologist and he said the brain science of my time is not up to the task of explaining patient's symptoms. The DSM-V didn't do it either. I mean it's like common, we have to do a better job.
