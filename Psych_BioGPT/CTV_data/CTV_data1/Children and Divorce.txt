What Divorce Means To Me 

00:00:35
MACY 

00:00:40
MACY To me divorce means that your parents are not married anymore and they-- and something has happened between them that has caused that. 

00:00:55
SAMMY 

00:00:55
SAMMY What divorce means to me is like your two parents are like separated and then switching from house to house. 

00:01:00
BRYNN 

00:01:05
BRYNN Divorce means to me parents separating and they're not gonna see you one at this time or one at the other. 

00:01:10
CANON 

00:01:15
CANON Divorce means, uhm, to me that my parents weren't happy married to each other and that they split apart so that they could be happy again. 

00:01:20
SILVIE 

00:01:25
SILVIE Divorce means to me, uhm, that they're ju-- they're not in the same house and they're not married. 

00:01:30
MAC 

00:01:35
MAC Divorce means to me, ah, your parents are not talking to each other as much as they used to be, uhm, living in separate houses and having separate rules as the other. 

00:01:45
SOPHIA 

00:01:45
SOPHIA Divorce means to me, well, at the beginning, it meant sadness but I found a way to live with it. I prefer it never happen but it's just a part of life. 

00:02:00
How I Heard 

00:02:05
CANON Well, I found that my parents were divorcing. I kind of thought about it one time because I will grow up and I was pretty going five or six I maybe and I heard them fighting but I didn't really think about it so I just went back to bed. But then, a couple of years later, we had this, uhm, playroom that's long and we also done watch TV with-- and eat there which we never do and then they told us. And we were kind of sad but you know, we kinda knew it was coming after all the fighting but it was night so it wake up and see it. 

00:02:30
BRYNN 

00:02:35
BRYNN I was actually, ah, uhm, in my mom's best friend's house and, uhm, we hang out with her a lot. And so we we're over there and I was outside I playing with my friends and my mom goes inside and I go back inside with her and she's crying on the bed. And I should've like, "What's wrong?", and she's like, "Daddy, daddy and me are getting separated." I'm like, "What is that mean?". And she talks about to me about it and I start losing my mind. I was like crying. 

00:03:10
SOPHIA 

00:03:10
SOPHIA Well, one day in the morning before school, it was Wednesday and she told me I've some really bad news. And then she told me all about it. I think she said some same like, "Me and your dad are getting divorce." I cried and then I cried so much. I have some friends that are divorce and they don't like it one bit so I was scared that I wasn't going like it. It was a complete surprise for me when I've found out they were getting divorce. 

00:03:40
MACY 

00:03:45
MACY I walked down the stairs because my brother and I we're doing something upstairs and I walked down the stairs and my mom, uhm, came downstairs and she said, "Macy and Jeffry, it's time that I need-- we need to tell you this that we're going-- your dad and I were going to get a divorce." And then Jeffry and I both started crying and we all hugged each other." Uhm, my brother and I knew why. My parents were getting divorce kind of because, uhm, we've seen my dad get really frustrated and mad and we kind of tell. I kinda felt it coming but I was like seven so I can really-- I understood quite a bit actually but I didn't really take all it in. But I, but I knew that it was gonna happen soon. And then my mom felt really bad so she gave us both a scooter. 

00:04:40
SAMMY 

00:04:45
SAMMY Well, I was like four and so I can't remember a lot about it but the one thing I can remember is sitting at the playroom and them sitting us on the couch watching Tom and Jerry and then they told us. They said they were fighting a lot and it just wasn't working out that they were getting divorce. I was pretty freaked out. I didn't know where was gonna leave. If someone was gonna move to different state. I wasn't gonna see my family like my Aunts and my Uncles anymore. I think they got into divorce because they disagreed on a lot of things and then they started fighting a lot more than they used to. 

00:05:25
SILVIE 

00:05:30
SILVIE They called me and my brother to go on the couch and, uhm, then they just told us that they were gonna get divorce and my dad was gonna move out. I was sad but I wasn't surprise like when they told us to go in the couch I knew like why? I didn't see anything. I was just really sad. I was crying. 

00:05:50
Mac 

00:05:55
MAC Oh, I found out that my parents were divorcing. They, uhm, all sat down in our playroom and they told us that they were getting a divorce. Uhm, at first, I was a little shocked and a little confused cuz I hadn't really know what divorce meant the full way. So I thought they're just gonna be like separating houses and not like being best friends, just like pals. I just think that they weren't as happy as they used to be and, uhm, just so much stuff for us going on. I really don't really know what but seemed like they were getting more unhappy with each other. 

00:06:40
[music] 

00:06:40
My Biggest Worry 

00:06:45
MACY 

00:06:50
MACY The first thing I thought was is my family that I think is my family? Is it going to become separated and more separated than it really needs to be? And thought nobody would talk to each other and so. I've felt that I've caused a divorce before but I just know that I didn't cause it. It was the parent that cause, that cause it or the parents that cause it. And kind of know in my heart that I didn't cause it but sometimes I tend to think that. I've talked to my mom about it and she gives me advise and she just says that, "It's not your fault. It's one of our faults." 

00:07:40
BRYNN 

00:07:40
BRYNN When my parents divorced I blamed myself cuz I thought they are arguing over me or something like what I did and arguing about the time machine or something. That day as she told because of me or something like that. One of my sister are like I were going my sister too like, "Oh, it's your fault," or something like that. 

00:08:00
MAC 

00:08:05
MAC Well, my biggest concern was that-- we were gonna start all, all five of us we're gonna start getting more and more unhappy without, ah, the other parent. 

00:08:15
SAMMY 

00:08:20
SAMMY Sometimes I feel like I caused the divorce like where I was a little kid sometimes I want like my mom's food and then my dad will get mad at me, and then they'd fight that night. So sometimes I feel like I caused the divorce. And before it was about not seeing people and it was really scary. 

00:08:35
CANON 

00:08:40
CANON When I found out they were divorcing, my biggest worry was definitely the stepparents. I was worried mostly about the same like evil step-mother gonna treat me bad, not let me do stuff same with the step dad being really mean and could not let me do stuff either. 

00:08:55
SILVIE 

00:08:55
SILVIE So my parents, they got divorced because they disagreed on a lot of things especially with each other. My biggest worry was, uhm, I may not getting to see my dad a lot or, uhm, another one I really didn't like was-- that we, we won't really again go on another whole family trip. I don't feel like I have caused the divorce and neither does my brother because my parents tell us that so often it's, it's kind of hard to believe it, it is your fault. 

00:09:40
[music] 

00:09:45
What has changed since the divorce? 

00:09:50
SILVIE What changed in my life since my parents have separated, uhm, not getting to see my dad everyday but pretty much fi-- four or five days a week I think that I've gone better. The others still a lot does fighting and they get along better when do see each other. 

00:10:10
CANON Uhm, I have four new siblings that are great. We have a new house at my mom that we has recently got. Mom, I have to say that my-- it's really different with my friends because instead of them coming out of one house, I have to make sure I get both houses, okay? 

00:10:30
SAMMY The things that have changed is my schedule like if, ah, like I wanna go to my friends, I sometimes I have to call my step mom and then my step-- and then my step-- step dad if I forget about my mom. 

00:10:45
BRYNN When my parents were divorcing, I didn't have to worry cuz I thought it'd fun going back and forth and having two different rooms and telling my fri-- friends, uhm, "Oh, I have two houses," or something like that cuz I thought it would be fun but no. 

00:11:05
MAC Well, my mom met my step dad. Well they're not married but they're just, yeah, he was with us. And with his two step-- with his two stepsons, we are, ah, happy family now. We like the same things and we dinner together and all that stuff. And then, my dad married my step mom but it has been a little rough at the beginning. It sort of hard to get a new mom so yeah, so it's been a lot more better now. 

00:11:35
BRYNN Things have been better for me since my parents' divorce cuz, uhm, I have more friends cuz I go to two different churches so I got to meet different friends. And, uhm, I have some really good friends at my dad's house. I got to see them a lot. And really good friends at my mom's like I see them a lot too. But being under the same roof with all my stepsisters and my step dad. It's really fun. 

00:12:05
CANON There is some hard part for having steps part for but it's-- there you know, there are brothers and sisters so you're gonna fight with them just like enough brothers and sisters over space or whatever. But, yeah, at the beginning it's kind of awkward when you first meet them and they're moving in with you or you know, their-- the sons of your-- or daughters of stepmother or father. But once they live for you in a while, you get over and you treat them just like a normal brother or sister. 

00:12:35
SAMMY Now I have more friends because I have my brothers now and my sisters. 

00:12:40
MAC Yeah, I was been better since that. Uhm, I got to know a little bit more people outside because, ah, my step mom and my step dad and their sons and daughters and their friends so it's sort of been a funny experience so learn more about people and meet more people than I don't-- than I think my parents we-- weren't divorced. 

00:13:10
MACY Divorce had changed a little bit about who I am and I feel like but not a ton like its seems li-- it changed my attitude a little bit. Well, not like my-- it hasn't my whole attitude but it changed what I feel. And if one of my parents said something and my attitude definitely changes a lot. But it doesn't change like right now. It's just if something bad happens. 

00:13:40
SAMMY The divorce has sort of change me like sometimes on my friends are asking like, "Hey, can we come to your house?" I say, uhm, " I really don't want you to," cuz my-- this was my like when I was five and-- cuz my parents were, were still fighting and then they were already divorce and still fight a lot. So I said, "No. They'll, they'll probably fighting and you guys don't wanna see that." 

00:14:00
CANON I was pretty sad for a while but once you do it, you forgot they're a lot happier. 

00:14:05
SILVIE I think it was a good thing that they did get divorce. I mean, I don't like it but it was-- it's way better than, than fighting all the time. 

00:14:15
SOPHIA Di-- divorce has made me a tiny bit happy but it doesn't really change me that much. Honestly, I just wish you would all go away. I don't wanna handle it. 

00:14:25
MAC I think divorce has changed me as a person a little bit more cuz I, I think it made me stronger and more emotional at the same time because I can't-- I said before I can't see the other parent as much. And making me stronger is, uhm, you see your parents by a lot more which is sort of sad but it-- you know that it's gonna happen because no-- it's not all loving in the world itself. 

00:15:00
[music] 

00:15:05
Caught In The Middle 

00:15:10
BRYNN There's a time I feel I, I am in the middle because I am like it's the usual thing I said. And my friends keep on telling me, "Be careful what you say over there, be careful what you say over here." So if you like I have to keep secrets from them or something that-- I think once I get along, it won't be that way and it will be okay. 

00:15:30
CANON I ever really felt like I was in the middle of my parent's problem because they all seemed to be just towards each other and not towards any of us except for me if you got that grade or something. But I never really felt like I was in the middle of anything. 

00:15:45
MAC Sometimes my dad is not secret-- clear to my mom and he sometimes get mad at her if she drops a soft laid and brings us a little too early. And sometimes I have to agree with my mom that she-- we have a lot of stuff going on at her house because six boys and one girl. It's a lot harder to get it my family somewhere you need to be on time. 

00:16:10
MACY Sometimes I feel like I have to two, two sides but I don't-- sometimes I feel like it but, but I don't do the action. I don't, uhm, two sides. 

00:16:25
SILVIE Sometimes I do feel like I have the two sides. Sometimes it's hard when I know when, when, when they're both fighting and one's right, and they're both really like they're really mad. And so I know if I say something like, "This parent is right." I know I'm really get in to trouble or something, and so I tried to stay out of it as much as I can. 

00:16:50
BRYNN I think that I should have, have to keep sec-- secrets from the parents but if you're in a situation like I am, it's a good thing to do. It, uhm, was not exactly good but if your parents-- if you don't want your parents saying, "Oh, you're not gonna see him or her for maybe a very, very long time just try it so you won't hurt yourself." 

00:17:20
MACY When time one of my parents have a-- have asked me to, to tell something mean to the other parent and that didn't make me very well so I told the parent-- they told me to tell the other parent, uhm, to stop it and I don't like it when they told me to say me things to my parent. 

00:17:45
SAMMY I think what would help them that you're in the middle of parents' divorce would to be try to go to more friend's house or try to invite a friend over to destruct you from your parents. And if you can't, just like go up in your room and play with something or go watch TV and don't listen like around to see if your parents fighting. Just focus on the TV. You're focus on what you're playing with. 

00:18:15
[music] 

00:18:20
Things That Help 

00:18:20
SILVIE What helped me get through with my parents' divorce was probably-- all I went to, ah, therapist for a while and I had a lot of friends to talk to about it. 

00:18:35
BRYNN My parents just talking at them to help me like-- they'll say like, "Oh, it's gonna be okay or sometimes they just have a private talk at me and saying, "Oh, you can do this. It will help yourself calm down or just go and stay in your room for a little while and just think to yourself or something like that." 

00:19:00
CANON And when they told us, they told us when we were all together. It wasn't like one by one and we spent a lot of time with them. After they told us and then after the divorce. Uhm, I think it was right that they need an equal, uhm, sharing because I don't think I could live a week at-- for someone else it isn't a day. Again, it wouldn't be very fun. 

00:19:20
SOPHIA When I'm at my dad's house, I asked him if I can call my mom and he let me. And when I'm at my mom I asked him if-- I mean, I asked her if I can tell my dad and she said yes. 

00:19:30
MACY A girl named Molly, she's my counselor. I talked to her about the divorce and stuff. She only just calms me and she asks me questions about it so I feel like I'm been actually someone's listening to me and so I really like how she does that. 

00:19:50
SAMMY Who gives me the strength and the courage is always having friends around and always going to school and thinking, "Okay, if I, if I do this right, I won't have to go home and practice on this," cuz sometimes my parents don't help me with Math problems or something. Uhm, so I, I always focus on my people work really hard and then we-- a-- it also helps me to go home and play with my brothers. 

00:20:20
Cameron 

00:20:20
CAMERON The things that helped me, or like maybe I'll play with toys, I'm gonna be playing a DS. 

00:20:30
SOPHIA I was involved in this group and it was helpful to me because, uhm, there were a lot of kids you went through the same experience and they were just so kind to me and it was really great. 

00:20:50
CAMERON I would talk about my mom and dad. I got to talk about my feelings. It made me happy inside because I'll talking about my feelings sometimes. 

00:21:00
MACY I, I talked to people about it and it, it helps a lot to get my feelings out. 

00:21:05
SOPHIA Well, mainly, my brother, he's always there for me to talk to and how he's always so understanding. He's my twin for bee's sake. 

00:21:15
SAMMY My best friend is Max. The thing I like about Max is he's the person I become talk to when something goes wrong with my parents or he's just really fun to have around. 

00:21:30
MAC And if I needed help to someone about the experience, I go to my brothers cuz they're usually going to the same thing as me so... 

00:21:40
SAMMY What helped me to get through the hard times where was my friend Max and, uhm, I talked to my teacher and my counselor. They just let me like say what I was feeling and then they, they would like to say, "It's okay. Just gotta be strong. If you need any more help, just come right back to me. I'll help you with anything." That really helped. They said, "Don't think it was you. It wasn't you. It's your parents' fault cuz they don't-- they fight a lot." 

00:22:10
SOPHIA Uhm, do do something you really like. It takes you more enough anything that's happening or, uhm, like listening music or again talk to your sibling. I talked to parents about it all the time like after that they will calm down and at me or something. 

00:22:30
MACY My, my best friend she's given me quite a bit of advice and I really like it because it's advise but it's not super strong advise so I don't have to deal a lot of things with it. She just really comforts me and I really like how she is always there for me whe-- if I need to talk to her whether she is at soccer practice or uhm, lying on the couch watching TV. She's always there for me so that's what I really like about her. 

00:23:05
SILVIE It's easier, way easier when you talk to someone about it and to not be afraid to ask people for help like-- and uhm, it will get better and to think good things instead of-- and try to find the the go-- better things in-- when you hav-- when there's the doors uhm, better things in it instead of the bad things. 

00:23:35
[music] 

00:23:40
Back and Forth 

00:23:45
MAC The hardest thing about my uhm, my parents being divorced is not being able to see the other parent. 

00:23:55
MACY I actually don't get to see my dad a lot. It's starting to get a little more but I see him once every two months probably. I personally don't like that I don't really see my dad a lot but it's kinda how it works out. I talk to my dad almost everyday, about five times a week and I call him and we talk. 

00:24:20
BRYNN Uhm, well I'm mostly with my mom so I'm used to being at my mom's and my dad has used to have this job where he'd be gone for like a week or something and so I would-- won't really get to see him and sometimes I wouldn't even get to talk to him cuz he's just like so of far away or it's to cost money to call him. Now I'm sort of used to being with my mom instead of my dad so when I go to my dad's it's sort of like not really uncomfortable but uhm, it's just different. 

00:24:55
SILVIE Well I usually-- on the weekdays I sleep with my mom uhm, like I am sometimes-- a lot of the times I'll have dinner at my dad's and then my mom would pick us up. In the summer especially we usually spend most of our days with our dad cuz my mom was working. 

00:25:15
SOPHIA Well, on summers we see each pair on a week at a time. 

00:25:20
MAC We split our time by, ah, one parent gets us for two days and the next one gets for two days and then one-- the other parent gets us for five days and then the next parent gets us for five days and it just goes in that pattern. Sometimes it's a little annoying because, like in school I have a bunch of stuff to bring from one parent's house to the other cuz I play a lot of soccer so uhm, I have a soccer bag and I have all my soccer stuff and it's very heavy sometimes so I have to carry it from school to the house and then two days later from school to the other house again. 

00:25:55
SAMMY The hardest part would probably be, be the, like if I'm, if I need to bring something to my mom's then forgetting and we have to drive all the way to dad's and then pick it up. 

00:26:10
SOPHIA The hardest part is mainly that I don't get to see the them and stuff and sometimes I feel a mess. 

00:26:25
If I Had A Magic Wand 

00:26:30
CAMERON Uhm, I wish my parents would get back together because, well, I miss my dad and I want him to like come back and live with my mom. It would look like they would all be together, a big, big family. My grandmas would be cooking uhm, and resting. My mom would be actually-- my grandmas would be resting, my mom would be cooking, my dad would be like, playing a board game maybe with me. 

00:27:05
CANON Ah, I do-- I did sometimes wish that my parents would get back together but then I realized that they are a lot alone without the other parent. 

00:27:15
BRYNN If I had a magical wand that would uhm, put uhm, my parents back together cuz I feel different this way and I have a step dad so now it's like and they keep on saying, "Oh, it's never gonna happen." But if it did I would so put them together. 

00:27:30
SAMMY If I had a magic wand my fa-- my family would probably be-- my parents would be back together. It would be me and my brothers and it may be living in a different house and the big one my dad's living in, like the one my mom's living in. They say like, "Well I wish I-- we could to make you guys happy or-- but it wasn't working so..." 

00:27:55
MAC In some occasions yes, I wish they would get back together but uhm, not right now because that right now our families have been put under control and how happy they are just makes me feel good so... 

00:28:10
SOPHIA Sometimes I feel they would get back together cuz then I could all say good bye to this. 

00:28:15
MACY Uhm, not-- I don't really wish that my parents would get back together because I feel like that would not be good for the choices that my parents-- our parent has made. There is a lot of like yelling uhm, when they were married and lived together and so now it's just now there's not a lot of yelling, there's not any yelling. 

00:28:45
[music] 

00:28:50
My Parents' Relationship Now 

00:28:55
SAMMY Now my parents are nice to each other but they're still kind of mean to each other and they still don't like to talk. 

00:29:05
BRYNN My parents don't say the kindest things about each other but I'm sort of used to it. 

00:29:10
MAC There-- they don't say mean things but they don't always don't say the most positive things about each other. But that's how they are because they used to be married and now they're not so they still are a little bit more unfriendly. So I think they're doing, ah, fine with how they talk but sometimes they need to be a little more nicer like, yeah. 

00:29:35
CANON Ah, my parents get along now like there are little things because they do own property together so there's things like that but they get along pretty well. Sometimes there's miss communication and everyone has those bad days where you're kind of mad at each other. 

00:29:50
SAMMY Then sometimes my step mom or my step dad starts fighting with the other parent like my real parent. One time I was around to hear that because I was to hear that because I was at my brother's soccer game, indoor soccer game and my step dad and my real dad started fighting. It made me feel really embarrassed and I'm really sad. I said, "Dad, stop it." He's just telling him what we said. 

00:30:15
MACY I'm feeling okay about my mom getting remarried. Uhm, I'm a little bit nervous cuz it's-- it was a, a month from yesterday and I'm a little bit nervous about it because there's gonna be quite a bit of kids and people on the house. There's gonna be six kids on the house and eight people on-- so it's gonna be a lot. 

00:30:40
BRYNN Like even when my step dad was sick my dad just went to the store and we got 'em some ginger ale and brought it back and that, that was one example of uhm, him being really nice. 

00:30:55
MACY Well I kind of think of what we're going to be doing is that we're going to be building a compound word like sunshine. One person's going to be the sun, one family's going to be the sun, one person's gonna be the sign-- the shine so it's gonna be one word and one kinda big family. I worry that my mom and the guy my mom's going to marry might fight but I know that they won't because they're really good together and they haven't fought ever once. What's good about their relationship is they know uhm, what's wrong and what's right to do and I think it's gonna be a good relationship because Nate doesn't yell and my mom doesn't yell so it's-- so there won't be any yelling or fighting. 

00:31:50
SAMMY I think I love both-- most about my family is probably that we're really close and some-- it's really nice to have a lot of people around because if you get hurt and the parents are gone then they help you. 

00:32:00
BRYNN What I love most about my family is uhm, if you're not getting along with one kid there's four more to get along with or play with. 

00:32:15

Hopes and Dreams 

00:33:00
MAC Uhm, I hope to be a professional soccer player and I hope my family does not turn into one of those families that wants their kids gone away. They get grumpier and nastier and, yeah. 

00:33:15
CAMERON My hopes and dreams are uhm, they would get back together. 

00:33:25
SOPHIA Well I hope that one day uhm, everyone will just be happy and one day I hope to be a successful mother and veterinarian and I'm going to try the best I can to not get divorced. 

00:33:40
CAMERON My hopes and dreams are that one day parents will be nicer to each other and to grow up and live a good life even though my parents had a divorce. 

00:33:50
SILVIE Ah, I hope to get married someday to someone really nice and who loves animals like me and uhm, who can-- like my mom, her really is they have to be smart and be able to take care of themselves and nice. And I think those are good. 

00:34:10
MACY I do hope to get married because I'd like to build a relationship after seeing not good things with my parents uhm, I know when I get married I'm not going to be doing that. 

00:34:30
MAC Yeah, I hope to get married someday. Uhm, hopefully not getting a divorce and not being happy with whoever I marry and uhm, yeah. 

00:34:40
SOPHIA When I get married I'm going to pick out the guy that's right for me. Someone who will understand me, someone who won't be betray me and get divorced. 

00:34:50
SILVIE I'll do things differently than how my parents did it when they were married. Uhm, it probably try to if it's reasonable uhm, agreed to things and try instead of to yell, try to work things out. 

00:35:10
MACY Uhm, I think I'll do differently is if my husband starts fighting then I'll think-- I think I'll just walk away from it and know that it wasn't pretty when I saw it as I was a kid cuz I know we'll all-- I'll always remember in a kid and seeing it. 

00:35:35
SAMMY I, I do hope to get married someday. I think all-- I think I will realize how hard it was for my-- for me as a kid to go through divorce and I will try not to get a divorce so my kids don't have to suffer that. 

00:35:55

00:36:00
Advice To Kids 

00:36:00
SILVIE Advice I would give to kids, that it will get better uhm, after a while and it will get easier and you'll get more used to it and but even though it's really hard at first, at the start. 

00:36:15
BRYNN Uhm, the advice I give other kids is just think to yourself that they're always there with each other and not, never gonna separate. Think-- what I do is I think, oh, mom's right here. She's just running errands or something and she'll be back in like a day or two or something like that. Just not really worrying about it. 

00:36:40
MACY Uhm, if I had a friend that felt that she was being-- that she was causing the divorce I would most likely tell her that you're not causing it, it's uhm, it's you parents that are causing it and you may think that you're causing it but really you're not causing it and you're doing everything you can and you can't really control what their ac-- actions are. 

00:37:10
BRYNN Uhm, if someone came up to me and blamed it on himself I'd say, "It's not your fault. Uhm, just think to yourself oh, it's not my fault, it's gonna be okay." You're, you're-- it's, it's not you. It's-- you know, your parents arguing, fighting but don't-- you don't need to worry about it, you're gonna be okay. 

00:37:35
SAMMY If I know a kid who was going through divorce I would probably say to him like It's not your fault, don't worry you're gonna be okay, I went through this, I felt this way and then after you get used to it it's not so bad and you just have to get past the emotional part. 

00:37:55
CAMERON I would give the advice to kids, you have your mom and she's the best thing so is your dad but he lives far away so you should ask your dad if you could visit him. 

00:38:15
CAMERON I told him everything's gonna be all right even though your parents aren't together. I told, told him that you just go with it and eventually you'll be happy. 

00:38:25
SILVIE There are really hard times, uhm, but they're-- they'll get better and that maybe when your parents are fighting you go do something that you like or if you have a sibling go-- you can go talk to them, younger, older I go to my little brother all the time. And or do something just either go outside or like do whatever you need to, to not be part of it or listen to it. 

00:39:00
MAC Advice that I would give to kids is to not to worry about uhm, being in separate houses and not being able to see the parents as much as I did because that's what it tore me apart for like a couple of months so... 

00:39:15
MACY Uhm, I've learned from my family that it's, it's okay to be hurt and it's okay to be-- its occurrence-- it's okay to cry and it's sometimes good to cry so you, so you get out all your feelings and it's-- you never want to hold in your feelings, holding all your emotions. You always want to get them out and talk to someone and if you don't have anybody to talk to you can talk to you pillow or your stuffed animal because you know that they don't have a brain so they can't tell anybody. 

00:39:55
SAMMY My advice would be, don't worry it's not your fault. Be strong, talk to anyone you can about it that you feel safe talking to and let your emotions pour out. It doesn't matter if kids laugh at you, just let your feelings pour out and don't be afraid. 

00:40:20

00:40:25
Advice To Parents 

00:40:30
SOPHIA I would tell parents to uhm, help make it easier and do whatever they could. I don't really know how but... 

00:40:40
MACY I think they need to try to spend a little more time with their kids, the opposite parent uhm, that's not living with them. I think they kinda make a little more effort. 

00:40:55
SILVIE Okay, so advice I would give to parents, if one's mad at something not having to do anything with the other. Try not to let show that you are mad cuz a lot of the times the other parent will react to that. For me it really makes me sad and affect-- uhm, and it's just hard, like my brother won't listen to it. He's like, "Are you still fighting?" you know. 

00:41:25
SAMMY Maybe they could have told us separately because we-- all of my brothers started freaking out all at one time and it was kind of really crazy. 

00:41:30
MAC I, advice that I would give to other parents divorces is to not to try to fight in front of the other kids or if you're on the phone, talk meanly in front of the other kids because that can set an example of how you sh-- you think you should ask cuz act-- because they are your parents and you think that they are, most of the time, right so you're sort of setting a bad example for yourself. 

00:41:55
SOPHIA I wish they had not moved and let me tell you that house was the first house I've ever remembered and it was great. There was this secret door between mine and my brother's room. There was a la-- waterfall in a pond in a bridge that you had to cross to go to the front door. Uhm, it was the memory where I got my first pet and my first pet that breathe on land and it was like leaving all my memories behind. 

00:42:30
MACY But actually I think he-- my dad to make it better for me and other kids I think that dads could uhm, come over if they live farther away because my dad always makes us drive over there. 

00:42:45
MAC They should either uhm, go into a room like their room and lock the door if they're talking on the phone or fighting and ask the kids to just like watch TV or go play outside. I think parents need to not fight as much and try to be nice around the kids when they're going through divorce. Try to toughen up a little bit and just be a little nice and then they can change their emotions or whatever later on when the divorce is over and they are uhm, in different houses, separate houses. 

00:43:25
MACY Uhm, I would say just try to keep your mouth shut or just go in another room or do it when the kids aren't around so the kids don't have to grow up in that type of relationship. Uhm, it makes them feel like it's okay to do that so you don't want your kids to grow up being mean to other kids or adults. 

00:43:50
MAC For like, genes like you get, same stuff as your parents and you think you're gonna grow up to be exactly like them sometimes cuz the genes but uhm, it's not about the genes, it's how you control your life and how you do stuff. 

00:44:05
BRYNN The advice I give parents is don't say it in front of your kids, just act like if you do say something mean act like it never happened and, and uhm, forgive each other or something. So don't like, be all mad at that person for a while and just forgive and forget.
