UNKNOWN Join me in welcoming Dr. Art Becker-Weidman 

00:00:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Thank you, that was very nice. Good afternoon, everybody. Hope you're somewhat awake after that nice lunch. Umm… Okay, I think I'm wired now properly. Umm… So, what we're here to talk about, or at least what I'll talk about and… and hopefully be useful for you, is umm… a… a Really what I want to talk about is the importance of parent capacity. You've heard, if you attended some of the pre-conference events, you heard that Dan and I as well as others talk about the importance of working with parents, a few were at the keynote speech today, certainly that came through in Dr. Perry's material that… that parents are vital. I really describe the role of parents as being the keystone for treatment success, the lynchpin. So, if we agree that that's true, then assessing parent capacity becomes a very, very important piece of our work before we begin treatment, or you might consider it part of the initial stages of treatment. But it becomes vital, not as a tool to screen in or screen out people, because I don't think that that would be a useful, umm… way to use this material, but it's a way to understand what are parent's capacity, so we know what their strengths are, and as helpers, what we need to focus on to help them be the kind of parent they would like to be. You know, I… I've… maybe you have… I've yet to meet a parent who would like to be incompetent, who would like to be neglectful, who would like to be a poor parent. Pretty much every parent I meet would like to be a good parent. Not everybody knows how to do that, umm… but they would like to be. So, the purpose of this, umm… presentation is to discuss some of the elements that you can use in assessing parent capacity so that you can then direct your work in the appropriate way, 'cause again, not one size fits all, you have to work with different parents in different kinds of ways. So, the first thing I want to talk about, just by way of background, is the factors that lead to placement stability, okay. What… And there is some research on this, and it's important to understand what factors lead to placement stability and what factors lead to placement breakdown, so that then we know what it is we want to look at, right. Because what we would want to do is pay most attention to the factors that lead to stability or breakdown. And the ones I'll be specifically talking about are insightfulness, reflective capacity, sensitivity commitment and the person's state of mind with respect to attachment or patterns of attachment. Okay, and at the end, I'll talk a little bit about implications. If the sound is good, umm… I'm hoping it is, there are couple of DVD clips of sessions I'll show you to exemplify each of these. Umm… If the sound isn't good then I'll just skip those and we'll have time for other stuff, okay. I'll pause periodically for questions. If you do have question that's… if you have a question that's relevant to, you know, kind of, what I've talked about to explain or elaborate, raise your hand. If you have a questions that's irrelevant or way off topic, hold that till the end. Okay. And then after this is over, I'll be glad to chat with you about that. Oh, the other thing, I always do this, every time I do a workshop, I love to have lotteries, because I like people to win, right. Those of you who've heard me before, you're probably getting sick of this. But anyway, the way this lottery is gonna work is whosoever… Does everybody have the cell phone, pager and beeper? Does anyone not have a cell phone pager or beeper? 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Here? 

00:04:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Here with you, right with you. You don't, you don't, okay. If you have a friend, maybe you can share. But anyway, the way this works is the first one whose cell phone, pager or beeper goes off, will take us out for a drink at the end of the day in the hotel bar. So, if you want to play, turn the sound up really loud so we can make sure that we can hear it, okay. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN What if it vibrate? 

00:04:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, well, it's unless we can't hear it. But if you want to play, you had to turn it up loud so you can hear it. Okay. All right, factors associated with placement stability include some of the following. Umm… First… And some of these are self-evident. Sometimes I do find it really amazing that we have to do research to prove what we already know, umm… but that sometimes is the case. Multiple foster placements increase the likelihood of permanency placement disruption. We all know that from our clinical experience, we've seen that, umm… if anybody doubts that then now you have a study that you can point to, you know, for that. By the way, the PowerPoint slides will be on the ATTACh members-only site. So, if you are a member of ATTACh, you'll be able to download those at no cost. If you're not a member of ATTACh, this is just one more reason to join ATTACh. Okay, and also the… on the… the DVD or CD that's been produced by Resourceful Recordings that you can get. What else? Okay, there we go. Foster placements instability, instability is associated with poor child outcomes. That's again one of these "duh". Of course, we know that. But again, there is a study to show that. Umm… Placement stability and attachment and trauma resolution promote healthy development in children. Again, obvious, self-evident, but just important to, kind of, set the ground work for this. So why is it some foster placements succeed and others don't? One of the things that I talk about or mention when I do training of therapists in dyadic developmental psychotherapy, or just other kinds of trainings, is that in my experience, the best predictor of treatment outcome is not how disturbed is this child, it's the parent capacity. It doesn't mean I don't do an assessment of the children and… and, you know, really try to thoroughly, carefully look at where they're developmentally, in terms of mental health, in terms of some of the issues that Dr. Perry raised earlier, because that makes a difference in the kinds of treatment and when we deliver the treatment and in what manner. But it is the parent's capacity to be insightful and sensitive and all these other things I've talked about, that determine whether a treatment, it will be successful or not. So, what researchers found, people who work with Mary Dozier, is that the commitment of foster parents is one of the best and primary predictors of foster placement stability. In fact, of all the things she looked at, and she looked at a whole variety of issues, that one factor, commitment, was the best predictor of placement stability. Umm… Now one of the interesting things that she found, which again, probably shouldn't be surprising, is that the longer someone's been a foster parent, the more children they've had in their home, the less committed they're to each child. Not that they don't provide good care, but their emotional investment in that child is lower. And again, if you think about it, that seems self-evident, right. Think about it just for your yourself. How many times could you open up your heart and fall in love with a child and claim them as your own and then have them be taken away to be reunited or to be adopted or something like that? You can probably do that a couple of times, but at some point, you're just not gonna be able to do that anymore, okay. So, commitments lower. Now at the end of the day what I'll talk about, in terms of implications, umm… I've probably given it away at this point, but I should ask the question before I do this. Umm… Oh well, but anyway. Umm… So, you'll get the answer, which is good. If you have a child, okay, I'll paint this sort of fictitious picture for you, and this child, umm… was removed from her home when she was six, severe abuse and neglect. Put in the temporary foster home, went to another foster home, bombed out of that, went into residential treatment, therapeutic foster care, couple of psychiatric hospitalizations. She is now, say eight-years-old, nine-years-old, and you're looking at placing her in a foster home, maybe pre-adoptive home, but a foster home. And you've got two homes, the dossier is in front of you, one of them is a family that was just certified last week. And the other one is Mrs. Jones, who has been a foster parent for 20 years. She's seen everything under the sun, she is pretty much unflappable. Where do we… I'll ask it this way, where do we usually place that child? 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Mrs. Jones. 

00:09:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN With Mrs. Jones, right. Why? Because she's got all this experience, she is unflappable, she is the perfect placement. And what Mary… the… one of the implications of Mary Dozier's research is that that's exactly the wrong home for her. She should be placed in the home of the family that was certified last week. Why? Because they will have more commitment, and the placement is more likely to be stable, okay. Now… that's not to say that that family won't need significant support and… and… and… and help and involvement of the… of the professionals, but the placement is more likely to be successful in that first home, not in the experienced home, okay counter intuitive. Umm… Second factor is adequate information, knowledge, training and very important, I want to… I should underline that, we'll put it in capital, bold letters, felt Support. Now what your… I think is supportive, but what the family experiences as supportive, okay. I mean, there are some things that are obvious, like I have found over, umm… over the years, families generally like it and they find it supportive if when they make a phone call to your office, you call them back within an hour or two, okay. They just… that's helpful, umm… and that you're available, okay. Whenever I finish an assessment and begin working with a family, I always say to them, if anything comes up, please give me a call. We can always chat on the phone. Most families actually don't. And I think part of the reason is, well, a lot of families I worked with, they're reasonably competent, but also I think, part of the reason is… is that, just that little piece of creating a bit of a secure base that they… that they know and they believe me, maybe because they called up to make an appointment and I called back real quickly, right, that… that I'm pretty responsive, just knowing that they can call me if things get difficult, probably what, probably helps them feel a little more confident, a little more relaxed or, to put it differently, less stressed. Which means that even when difficult situations comes up, they're probably better able to handle them just for that reason, okay. And of course, I have some families that within a week or two, they call up, I call them right back and then they, kind of, never call again, because they kind of needed to check that out. But felt support, umm… support that's meaningful for the family, adequate information is important, adequate knowledge, that's why that first family I mentioned would need a lot of support. They'd need the training, they'd need, uh… the involvement of a… of professional in some regard who can be there to coach them and answer their questions and give them advice, and… and be helpful to. And then the other thing that's very important is that their birth children, if there are birth children in the family, not be adversely affected. Okay, that's very important, okay. Uh… Why do some foster placements break down? Well, in addition to the opposite of what I talked about just a moment ago, first, foster parents being under prepared to meet the child's needs, you know. You ever read some of the blue book(ph), you know what I'm talking about, buy the blue book. In Europe they call it the blue book. These are the profiles of adoptable children, okay. So, you know, you can get them online. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:12:58
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What's that? 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:13:01
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Yeah. Umm… And you read these descriptions of these… they all sound wonderful, you know. Uh… You know Johnny, eight-years-old, delightful little boy, needs a lot of structure, umm… is in counseling, is very active. And so now, you know, of course, those of us who work in the field are thinking, okay, clearly he has opportunity to find to this, sort of, probably ADD, I mean, you know. But sometimes, we… we aren't clear with foster parents. And that works to our detriment. So, they're unprepared, right. Lot's of families I see come in and, maybe they've adopted a child three, four, five years ago, and they're, kind of, relived when they get whatever the assessment is, the explanation, what's going on with their child, because now finally they know what to do. And they often would say, "I wish someone would have told us this stuff when we adopted this child. If we'd known, you know, we still would have adopted, just we would have done something differently." So people need to be adequately prepared. Umm… Can foster child who poses a serious physical risk to the foster parents or their children, will be another factor that can lead to breakdown. So we have to… which, as you all know, right, if you do trauma treatment, what's the first principle, what's the first thing that has to be present if you're gonna do good, appropriate and adequate trauma treatment? 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Safety. 

00:14:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Exactly, safety first. So, the same applies here, if you want a placement to be stable, safety first. It has to be a safe home for… for everybody. Uh… Other issues, you know, health of the family members, umm… and, umm… then, again the opposite of what I talked about earlier, foster parents who feel unsupported by the system. They call their case work when they get a call back next week, right, or they're told, "Oh, don't worry, all kids do that. That's normal." Umm… That's not helpful. Even if it's true, that's not helpful, okay. Okay, umm… now, just again to underscore the importance of… of parents. This is another study done by Mary Dozier, umm… which underscores the power of good parenting. And by that I mean not providing, not doing good stuff. It's not the doing, it's not the things, it is how it's done that matters. And that's what this underscores. It's… It's the parent capacity, the how they do what they do, that is so important. What Mary Dozier did in this study, this was in Delaware, uh… she looked at children who had been in placement for eight months, and using something that I'll talk about in a moment, called the adult… well not a moment, maybe a couple of minutes, the adult attachment interview. She determined the foster mother's state of mind with respect to attachment. And she does… there are several categories. She just divided that population into two broad categories. Either they had a secure pattern of attachment, or everything else, which includes dismissing, preoccupied, disorganized. Okay. And then using something called the strange situation protocol, which was developed by Mary Ainsworth, and is a methodology for assessing a infant or young child's pattern of attachment with a particular caregiver. She looked at just two of the four patterns, secured pattern and disorganized. The disorganized pattern of attachment is the one that is most likely to develop into the mental health diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. Umm… Disorganized attachment typically is caused by parenting by somebody who is frightening or frightened in their interactions with the child. In other words, they've got significant trauma issues of their own that interfere with their capacity to do all the things that Bruce Perry talked about earlier today, okay. So, just looked at those two. And so what she found was after an infant, a child, young child, had been in placement for eight months, if they were placed with the foster mother with a secure state of mind with respect to attachment, about two thirds of them also had a secure pattern of attachment. Which is great, that's exactly what we'd like to see. About a fifth had the disorganized pattern, more than in the general population. In general population, it runs 5% to 10%, but… but pretty good. Foster mothers who had any other pattern of attachment, what we see there is the reverse. Two thirds of the infants in their homes had a disorganized pattern of attachment, and only a fifth had the secure pattern of attachment just after eight months. Not doing anything in particular, not been trained in any particular way to do anything special, just by who they were, just by looking at their state of mind with respect to attachment. So, it's very, very important, okay. Okay, couldn't tell if you were stretching or if you had a question. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN I have a question (inaudible ). Why (inaudible ) eight months? (inaudible ). 

00:18:32
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, good question. His question is why did Mary Dozier pick the eight months. It's an excellent question, and I don't know. Umm… I'm not sure. I know that Mary Dozier is very, very particular about the research she does and the measures, and everything has to be, you know, in just the right box, which again, if you're doing research, makes sense. My guess is it had something to do with numbers and… and placement stability and getting enough numbers in each group. That would be my guess, but I really don't know. Yes? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN I might be able to answer that. We keep track children placement at a time at which the honeymoon is over, and the mom is getting a little tired. Things start falling apart between eight months and ten months. So, it's a really a good time to look at that. I'm just saying, we've done that research at our agency, and that's what we learned. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN It still doesn't answer why. 

00:19:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Pardon me. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Why. (inaudible ), doesn't matter. 

00:19:41
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, doesn't matter. Okay. Umm… So, important issues then. Parent… the… the… In… In my way of thinking, these are the important issues that you need to consider in assessing parent capacity. First, reflective ability, reflective ability… I don't want to embarrass anyone, but does anyone not know what reflective ability refers to? Or what the reflective function refers to? If you don't, it's fine, raise your hands, because, you know, I'll elaborate in more detail. If everybody understands, I'll go through it real quickly. Everybody knows what that is? Okay. So, parent reflective function is very important. That ability, as Peter Fonagy describes it, to mentalize the relationship and have a mental representation of me, my internal states, my intensions, my feelings, you and what I think are your internal state's feelings and intensions, which are different than mine, okay. An example at the extreme other end of what would be called, umm… mind site blindness, which would be the opposite of that. If I held up a box of mints, okay, and umm…, you know, showed you what's in them, or you know, you could say, and I showed them to you, you would say mints are in the box, right, yes. Okay, good, good. Okay. Now if I dumped them out and put paper clips in them and close the box and say, "Now what's in it?" You would say what? 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN Paper clips. 

00:21:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Paper clips, exactly, good, you know, these are not trick questions. If you had a secure pattern of attachment, you would just answer. You wouldn't think I have any ulterior motive. So, now everyone is gonna answer. If I took that, umm… that box is full of paper clips, and went out into the hallway and showed it to somebody there, this box of, uh, mint… the mint box with paper clips, and showed it someone there, what do you think they would say is in the box? 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Mints. 

00:21:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mints, exactly, because you can mentalize and think about them and understand what their perspective would be. It's different than yours. Someone with autism, if you ask them the same question, their answer will be, they'll say there are paper clips in the box, because they don't have the… the ability to recognize that somebody else can have a different perspective, that they can know stuff that somebody else doesn't know or vice versa, okay, so reflective ability, very important. Parent insightfulness, okay, that ability to have insight into yourself and… and the other person, state of mind with respect to attachment, and commitment, okay, very important issue. These are the ones that we want to take a look at and… and assess. Key dimensions for successfully parenting challenging children, umm… you're on attachment history, or the parent's attachment umm… history is extremely important, umm… and your ability to be aware of it and reflect on it is very important. Umm… Dr. Perry earlier talked about how children who have had significant negative experiences don't find relationships intrinsically rewarding, and that some children have this sort of push-pull. They start to get close then they push away, right. Remember… Do you remember that? Okay. I describe that as, many of the children we work with, I use a different word to thinking about, I describe it that they're relationship phobic. It's not a clinical term, but it's a way to think about it. What does that mean? It means that they find relationships threatening and frightening. Why, because they've been threatened and frightened because of their involvement in relationships. So, like all of us, just like all of us, there is a degree of intimacy that they're comfortable with in their relationship. For them, it's a great deal of distance. For some of us, it's, you know, much less distance. So, what happens, they come into a family and there is a degree of intimacy that begins to develop, maybe they begin to feel uncomfortable with it, right, because it's too close, they are relationship phobic. And then they do a lot of different things. And all of a sudden, one day, they do something and that creates a degree of intimacy that they're comfortable with. What do they do, they're just sort of pushing all these different buttons on, sort of, some control board, and then they hit the one button for you that irritates you, annoys you, frustrates you and creates the degree of intimacy that they're comfortable with. So, your attachment history then becomes very important, and your ability to reflect on your attachment history, and have insight into it so that you can disconnect that button, and so that you remove all barriers to a rewarding, positive, enjoyable, joyful, playful, interactive relationship, okay. You got a question or you're just stretching? 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN I have this (inaudible ) reflective function. But I am not sure (inaudible ). 

00:25:00
(inaudible) 

00:25:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN To see the way they reflect on you and the other person, and you can do that and recognize points of view, okay. Generally… Generally husbands don't have that ability. So… but… but lots of other people do. It's funny, sometimes, I'm afraid to so… well, it's okay. Sometimes my wife and I, we have these discussions, umm… and, you know, I say to her, "Wait a minute, let me… let me you know explain to you what I mean." And… And because it's obvious to me she is not agreeing with me because she just doesn't understand, right, you know. And… And she is great, she'll look at me and say, "No, I understand perfectly. You're just a moron, you know." No, no, no really." She says, "No, no, you… you really think I can't understand you and that if I did, I'd agree with you. But no, I understand exactly what you're saying. You're just wrong, you know." It's like, okay, fine. So, I've learned… I wish I've learned… I don't know that I always believe that, but I've learned to say that and then be quite. You know, someone else once said, umm… in the relationship, the… the… the wife always gets the last word, but if the husband says something else, then it's the beginning of a new argument, okay. So, I've learned that one too. Anyway… Flexibility, flexibility is very important, psychological and emotional flexibility. Why, because again, if you have a child who comes to you with this trauma history, who is "relationship phobic", right, as I think about it, you have to be relatively flexible to avoid that. Or to describe it differently, right, how many people does it take to have a power struggle? 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Two. 

00:26:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Two, right. So if I don't engage, I don't know what I have left, but it's certainly not a power struggle, right. So, very… but you have to be flexible to be able to do that. You have to be able to, umm… disconnect your own buttons, so that they don't get pressed, and be flexible, umm… playful, do all of those things. Just do a real quick… quick story, I think it exemplifies this. I was working with a family and they're little 9-year-old girl, umm… I forget what I said or did, but she got very annoyed about it. Anyone here bothered by profanity? If you are, close your ears for just one moment please. Anyway, she got really annoyed with me and she… you know, her face got screwed up and she started snarling at me, "You fucker, you're a…" And she was going on and on like that, right. And so after about 15 seconds, which believe me, that's a lot to sit there, umm… you know, because I'm trying to think, "Now, what do I say, what would I do here? I did something to provoke her, you know, what can I do to salvage the situation?" Anyway, then I just looked at her and it sprang to my mind, and I said to her, "You know, that's Dr. Fucker to you." And she just, you know, she started laughing, her parents, you know, smiled like, kind of, got that. But I think of that as, sort of, flexibility, I mean, I think the interaction she was expecting is that, because… I guess would normally happen if she did that in school, or… or… or even maybe at home, she would say things like that to people and then they would either yell at her or they would put her in time out, or they'd give her a lecture, right, about, that's disrespectful, that sort of stuff. So, by not responding in that way, it just changed the dynamics. So, flexibility is very, very important. And of course, self-awareness so that you can always be thinking about, "What's being invoked in me, what's my emotion." What does that reflect? Is it reflecting what's happening here or is it reflecting what I'm bringing to the situation/ Is this a reaction, or is it what I want to say, is it gonna be helpful or not helpful? You have to have that continual, sort of, internal dialogue going, okay. But… But it shouldn't be too loud, otherwise that's considered psychotic, okay. Importance of place, this is just a way to think about, then… then putting all of that together, this again gets a little bit into treatment, and I'm not gonna talk much about that, but umm… but what you're looking for is… is for the caregivers to create an environment that's healing for the child, which is being playful and loving, and accepting of the feelings and the motivations of the behavior, and then being curious and having empathy, okay, curious in about what's driving the behavior, okay. You might think you know why the kid did what they did, but very often you don't know why they did what they did. Why, because our background is different than theirs. So, we can't assume that we know, okay. And you can't ask them, right and wouldn't it be so much easier if you could say, "Why did you do that?" "Oh, I did that for this reason. I did that because I was thinking about my birthmother and you reminded me of her, so that's why I bit you." "Oh, okay. Well, now we've got that cleared up." But they don't know why, they can't answer that. So, by being curious, you can eventually get to that. So, just briefly on that. Family of origin issues again, umm… I touched on that and that's key, that's important, you have to know as I described it, as I described it here. Buttons, who owns the button, you do. Your child, the child may push the button, but it's your button and so you're the one responsible for making it not a button anymore, not the child. Okay. You're the one responsible for creating an environment that is healing and helpful, not the child. Umm… And then… with that last… the second point that really refers to is that in my experience, umm… again, parents wants to be successful, they want to be helpful. So, if you give them some ideas or some things to do, and then they come back next week and say, "Oh, you know, I tried it, but then I lost my temper and I yelled again." Oh, so you talk about it, you figure out. "Okay, good, good. I got it now, I know what to do." And then they come back the next week and say, "Oh, you know, I lost temper again, right." But they're not happy about that, and that's… that becomes, sort of, your way in to then helping them figure out, well, where does that button come from, what does it connect to? Because they'll want to disconnect it, they'll want to be successful. They're not happy… most parents are not happy when they say, "I know what I should do. I just keep blowing it every time." Okay. So, usually, I figure… I just assume most people, after the assessment, kind of do what, you know, they would like to do, and if there is an obstacle, then we kind of figure that out together. Parents with unresolved trauma, right, we see a lot of those parents, right, either we're working birth families, even a lot of foster and adoptive families, have their own unresolved trauma that will interfere with all of this, right. Umm… Parents with unresolved trauma need a lot more work. I call it a lot more ACE time, or a lot more time with you trying to be an ACE therapist, meaning being accepting, curious and having empathy, okay. That's the basic way to build a relationship and to umm… to help them begin to resolve their trauma, right. And again, you know, if you… if you've read anything about trauma treatment, that's, uh… the core of trauma treatment, safety first and then revisiting the trauma to integrate it, okay. And how do you do that? You have to do that by being accepting of the person, accepting what they feel, accepting of their perspective, being curious to help them explore that and then having some empathy for them that creates the… the what, the secure base that's necessary if you're going do exploration and then achieve integration and… Bless you… and then healing, okay. Relationship first, okay, so all about relationships. That needs to be the focus of treatments. It's… Because what we're talking about here are what, relational disturbances, and so if it's… if there are relational disturbances, then we need the relationship, sort of, in the room and that's what we treat is the relationship. Umm… So, building a relationship is really a key. And for a lot of families that we see, especially if they have unresolved trauma, even though it's not considered psychotherapy, uh… often the most therapeutic thing you can do, especially in terms of if you focus initially, right, you're thinking about this family, they have all this stuff that they're bringing, trauma that's happed to them, they've been to the child welfare system themselves, they have a lot of things that need to be cleared up. Umm… So, your thought is, "Okay, first I got to build the relationship with them." One of the ways sometimes to do that is through case management. We don't think of that as psychotherapy, but it is. It is because it facilitates building relationship. So, helping someone get the benefits they're entitled to, public housing, whatever it happens to be, can be a way to build a relationship. And it's through the relationship that then you'll help the parent address any of these issues, unresolved trauma, difficulties in their own pattern of attachment. You can help them develop greater insightfulness, greater reflective abilities, greater sensitivity, that all comes through the relationship, okay. So… 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN So you're saying, I mean… (inaudible ). 

00:35:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Absolutely, yeah, yeah, so that, you know, I'm working… 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:35:16
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, I remember that… I remember that's where if someone… if someone is in the (inaudible ), I'll help them. Yeah, in private practice, you might see someone who… who, you know, maybe they have, you know, a Family Health Plus or whatever, and they could get food stamps, they could get public housing or whatever, and, yeah, I would… I would help them get that. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Advocacy with his goals. 

00:35:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Advocacy with his goals, exactly, you know, not just… again I, you know, I don't just say the parents, "Gee, you should have an IEP. Your kid clearly qualifies for that." I'll write a letter, I'll call the chair of the community on Special Education, umm… if they want me to, I'll go to a meeting, okay. Umm… And parents find that really helpful, okay. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN lot of times parents aren't able to fill out any of the simplest forms on their own in private… I mean, I'm in private and that's just part of what I do. If they need assistance in doing something, filling that form, if they can't figure out… 

00:36:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. She was saying, just sometimes filling out a form that they don't know how to. Well, they don't know the magic words to use. And all of those things are a way to demonstrate your value to them. Again, what we're talking about is, I want to build the relationship with this parent or parents, who probably are somewhat suspicious. Why, well, they have their own baggage they're bringing in, right, umm… they may have had negative experiences. So, this becomes a way to build the relationship, okay. You always want to be thinking, "What's my goal?" Once you know what your goals is, then there are lots of ways to achieve it, okay. So, I'm not doing case management or filling out a form, because I think that those are intrinsically good things, or what they may be. I'm doing it because it's a way to achieve my goal, which is building a relationship with the parents, so we can do the work to help them be the sort of parents they would like to be to help the child, okay. Okay. Okay, so methods to assess. This is what I'm gonna then talk about for the rest of the afternoon, is I'm going to talk about the insightfulness assessment and how you can assess insightfulness, reflective capacity, sensitivity, the commitment assessment and then patterns of attachment. I'll talk a little bit about the adult attachment interview in the clinical use of that instrument, not the research use, but the… the clinical use, okay. Okay, okay, great. Patterns of attachment then, umm… these are the… broadly speaking, these are the four different patterns, umm… secure, avoidant, ambivalent, disorganized, these… this refers to adults now, okay, I'm talking about adults. Generally, if you, the ranges are all over the place, but if you look broadly speaking, about 60%, so about 60% of the people in this room probably have a secure pattern, umm… in the population generally, that's what it is. About 20% have an avoidant pattern, 15% have an ambivalent pattern and then 5% have a disorganized pattern, okay. These are not mental health diagnosis, let's be clear about that, these are not disorders. These are ways of managing relationships. The first three are, you know, by and large are functional, healthy people, okay. This is the way they manage their relationships. The avoidant person tends to discount emotions, maintains some distance, not put a lot of, you know, stock and… and… and faith in… in patterns of attachment and… and… and emotions and all that. The ambivalent pattern, umm… or preoccupied, actually, would be in the adult, preoccupied pattern refers more to that being really over involved in umm… thinking about emotions and relationships and… and all those kinds of things. So, I guess, if you are gonna do stereotypes, I would say the… actually, I probably would change. It wouldn't be 60% of the people in this room… would be healthy and secure. Probably most of the people here might be ambivalent, because we spend so much time thinking about relationships and feelings and emotions. And, if anyone here have a friend or partner who is an engineer? Anybody? Yeah, that might be your avoidant pattern, perhaps, okay, I'm just… these are ster… I'm just joking. Take that off the tape. Okay, and then this just sort of compares the… oh, yeah. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Wouldn't you want to assess yourself? 

00:40:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, actually, (inaudible ) but yeah, yes. 

00:40:08
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:40:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah, you would want to, yes, as a therapist, as a helper, you would want to know what your patterns are, umm… what your own pattern is, so that you can take that into account. Some other… I don't have it here… some other… this is a different subject, but some other very interesting research that Mary Dozier did looking at patterns of attachment in therapists, what she found was that therapists who had a secure pattern, generally could work well with lots of people. Therapists who had a umm… preoccupied pattern could do very good treatment with patients who had an avoidant pattern. They didn't do so well with patients who had a preoccupied pattern. And… And therapists who had an avoidant pattern tend to do well with those who had a preoccupied pattern. So, again it was a… the implication of it was again, like you're suggesting, if you know your own pattern, then you can do some better matching. Good point. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN What about people with borderline personalities? 

00:41:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, excellent question. Question… what about people with borderline personalities? What pattern of attachment would they fall into and, umm… I think it's in the references on this PowerPoint slides, but an excellent, umm… book that you might want to look at is Clinical Applications of the Adult Attachment Interview, edited by Steele and Steele, came out in, I think, in 2009, Guilford Press, New York, umm… and they addressed that and several other questions. They're actually isn't much of a linkage between many mental health diagnosis and patterns of attachment. Umm… There might be some slightly more, uh… over… umm… you know, higher percentage of people with borderline having a disorganized pattern, but… but… but not… it's not like 80%, like, you like might think just knowing about it. No, it's just a slight elevation and… and overall, umm… there is not a statistical link between patterns of attachment and different mental health diagnosis. So, that's an excellent book to look at, and especially if you want to use the adult attachment interview clinically as I'm going to talk about it, you really should get that book and read it. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Could you repeat it? 

00:42:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, yeah, it's called Clinical Applications of the Adult Attachment Interview. I was looking for a pad, but there is nothing up here to write on. I guess I could write on the screen, but then I'd get in trouble. And it's edited by Steele and Steele, S-T-E-E-L-E, and Steele, Howard and Miriam or and Miriam and Howard, I forget who the first one is. And Guilford Press… what… Guilford Press, and I think it's 2009, could be 2008. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) if we were not able to help them to develop kind of clear attachment, umm… abilities, he'll grow up to be spoilt or hard. 

00:43:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Uh… Some do, may do, but again, if you go back to your… umm… if you took umm… philosophy and logic in… in college, it's true that every pine is a tree, but not every tree is a pine, and that's what you're… that's what you're looking at there. It's very true, every tree is a pine, but not every… not every tree is a pine, but every pine is a tree, okay, so… Yes? Umm… good question. The question is why wouldn't there be a pattern, 'cause it sort of seems obvious, and in fact, John Bowlby even wrote a… a chapter or did a lecture on, you know, for example, talking about the, umm… you know, anxious patterns of attachment and anxiety disorders. But it just turns out, in terms of research there isn't really a strong link. And part of it because there… there should have… they're different domains. Umm… They're related, but they're somewhat different domains. Again, there is an overlap, because certainly, experiences effect the brain and all of that stuff, umm… but they're still slightly different domains. And so there… there just isn't that one-to-one correspondence. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) ever be some (inaudible ). 

00:44:35
(inaudible) 

00:44:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… Yeah, probably, could be, 'cause again they tend to be not complete… directly umm… related. And that's why… that's why I think this book is so wonderful because… because it presents a truly interesting, uh… empirical research showing that there… there can be some linkages, but they're just very weak. They're very, very weak linkages. So you… you… you really should not use the AAI to make or confirm a psychiatric diagnosis. You really shouldn't do that because the linkages are so weak. Not to say that there are not some overlap or some linkages, but you really should not, you know, say, "Well, this person's borderline and it's confirmed by the fact that they have a disorganized…" But you really shouldn't do that, they are… they are… they are different issues. Okay. Okay. 

00:45:30
(inaudible) 

00:45:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It's personality disorder and this is a way of managing uh… relationships and, they obviously have some impairments, but again, they're… these are different domains. Okay, so, I talked about this one. The adult states of mind with respect to attachment in the child states of mind are related, they're measured differently, but they are… again, this is another example of… in different areas we're seeing, like, the same phenomenon. And patterns of attachment tend to be stable. Once… Once the person hits about age five, approximately, give or take couple of years, your pattern of attachment crystallizes into one pattern that you use across the broad. And it tends to be stable throughout the lifecycle, unless there are important significant relationships that the person gets involved in that change that. Okay. So, a person could have a… a avoidant pattern of attachment, and because of marriage to somebody or involvement in, uh… you know with a coach or some long term relationship that could change. Okay. But again, it changes through relationship. Psychotherapy would be another way. Okay. I'm not gonna go through that. Okay. So, let me talk a bit about, umm… methodologies to assess. And I'm gonna talk first about the insightfulness assessment. The insightfulness assessment, well, kind of like it sounds, is a methodology for assessing a caregiver's insightfulness regarding that particular child, okay. Umm… I like this methodology because it's relatively, umm… it's not that time consuming, um… overall, you need about an hour to do the first part and then you probably need about umm… maybe 30 minutes to 45 minutes to do the… to do the second part of it. So, overall in terms of your time, umm… you know, you're probably looking at maybe two and a half hours, maybe three, probably two and a half hours, to do the entire thing. So, the way you do this is first, the first component, is you have to umm… have four episodes of parent-child interaction. And so what I usually do umm… the four are first 10 to 15 minutes of free play, and you're videotaping this, okay. So, you have a playroom, you're videotaping it. Umm… What I instruct the parent and child, what I instruct the parent to do is go into the playroom with your child and I would just like you to play. And there are stuff in there, there's a dollhouse, there are puppets, there is Lego, you know, it's a regular playroom, okay. And then after 10 or 15 minutes, I go in and I give them the next activity, which is a teaching task. And the one I use, umm… which seems to work reasonably well, is I give the parent a big container of do a Duplo blocks… Anyone not know what Duplo blocks are? They're big Legos. And so little pieces, they're like… they're as big as this deck of cards, okay, so they're just easier to, umm… manipulate. And I say to the parent, "What I'd like you to do is build a pattern and have your child… teach your child how to make exactly the same shape, color and pattern." Okay, so they have to teach the child there. And then after about 15 minutes, I come back and I have them do a competitive activity. And, umm… for this what I usually do is I usually have parents play Connect Four. Anyone not familiar with that game? Okay. Good game, I forget what the age range is, but even like four-year-olds can play it with parents. So, it's a pretty good game. And they can play many, umm… iterations of it in a 10 to 15 minute time period. And then at the end of that, I come back in and ask them to do a nurturing activity. And usually what I have them do is I want the parent to read to the child. I give them several books, read. So, now I've got all this tape… Oh, uh… yes, back there? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN I just want to ask, can you give an example of what you do with older children? 

00:50:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, what… oh, good… that's a good point. Thank you. The question was what do I do with older children. Umm… This really is a methodology for say, you know, maybe three, four-year-olds, up to probably about 10. So, if you're asking about teenagers, umm… I don't know that I would use this. I mean, you could adapt it. Umm… So, you might have them read a story together, or make up a story, umm… might have them prepare… depending on your setup, you might have them prepare a snack together. So, it might be something like that you could do. You could still have them play freely in the playroom, it's just instead of having blocks and doll houses, you'd have other things for them to do, maybe more like a… like a sand tray table, might be something they could all get involved with, clay, pens, pencils, chalk, oil pastels, that sort of stuff. Teaching tasks… probably do the same thing. Uh… Competition, you could do the same thing. So, those would be… that the two ends is where I probably do most of the adaption. Okay. Good question, thank you. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Observation where I just stumbled across (inaudible ), assessment tools it's called a parent or adolescent, it's called a parent-adolescent relationship questionnaire. I really like them 'cause they examine so specifically aspects of that relationship, (inaudible ), each depicted independently (inaudible ). 

00:51:53
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay, thank you. Then after you've don't that, they… they go home and then what you do is you look at the video tape. And umm… what I would say is that now at this point, they're actually two different… not two different, there are two paths you can follow if you want. If you're gonna do just the insightfulness assessment, what you do is you take a two-minute clip from each of the four episodes. And it should be the same, in terms of the protocol, it should be the same two-minute clip. Meaning, the first two minutes of each four or the fourth two minutes of each four, whatever, but should be that and you put that on a separate tape or DVD. Okay, I also look at the entire tape, because I also will use that later with the parents, often, to talk about different things. But I'll talk about that, maybe… maybe later. Then the parent comes back and they meet with you in a room with a TV and a DVD or a, you know, VHS player. And, you show them the first two-minute clip, and then you ask them these three questions. What do you think went through Mary's mind? What do you think… assuming the child's name, Mary, just call the kid "Mary", the parent will have no idea what you're talking about. What did Jonny feel and think during this segment? Then you see what their answer is, you can write it down. You could also audio record it if you prefer. Then is this segment characteristic of John more generally? Does it tell you something about John's personality or characteristics? See what they say. I would now like to ask you about what you felt while watching this segment. Did anything concern you, surprise you or make you happy in the segment? You have to make sure they answer each of those. So they may… they give you what surprised them, you would then go back, "Okay, good. But did anything make you happy, or concern you?" Okay, and you write all that down and you audio record it, and then you do that for each of the four episodes, okay. Then when you're all done, then there are series of questions you ask more generally, and these are the questions, okay. So the first… and so you can see how these questions tap into insightfulness, right. You know, what do you think went through your child's mind? Well, you have to have some degree, right, of insightfulness to think about that, right. And, you know, as you who've seen the interaction, you probably have your own theories, and so that begins to allow you to start to at least qualitatively assess their level of insightfulness. You know what the… So, you have a child who is, you know, who to your mind looks frightened, right. Who looks very cautious and freighted, and the parent says, umm… "Oh, what did they feel and think?" "Oh, I think they were just thinking about, you know, that this was fun and they were having a good time playing with dad." Okay. And you would then… and you might think to yourself there is some other mismatch here, okay. Okay, so the last section. You ask, "From what we've talked about during this interview until now, and from what you know about your child in general? What characterizes your child as a person, as a child?" In others words, what makes Eric, Eric. I will now write down what you say and ask you for examples later." So, you write down exactly what they say. And, oops… oh no yeah, and then you go through this. "Based on how well you know your child, are these… are there things about… are there things about your child that surprise you, concern you, make you happy?" Etcetera, etcetera. So, these are the questions that you ask at the end. And so, like a lot of the methodology I'll talk about today, you can either use this qualitatively and informally, using… using your clinical judgment, because don't forget you have clinical judgment, right. Everyone should be nodding your head at this point. If you're not nodding your head, then you need to call your licensing board up and turn your license back in, okay. So, you have clinical judgment, you have particular orientation, you can bring that to bear and use this material, you know, bring your perspective to interpret this material, okay, within that. You can use it that way. It's a more informal qualitative way to use it. Umm… if you want to be a little more formal about it, then you would, uh… go through articles that this is based on and they give you more details about, kind of, how to score this and how to evaluate this. Okay, so that's insightfulness. Any questions about this before I move on? No. Okay. Umm… okay. Reflective ability, umm… I've talked a little bit about that, what it is, it's a theory of mind, the ability to reflect on yourself, other and the relationship. Could I… just a simple clinical example, and then I think I will, umm… maybe… then I'll show you a video clip that sort of exemplifies that. But just a simple example, I like to use this one. I was talking with a boy, he is about, at the time he was about 14. And he was describing to me, umm… all of the things his birth mother had done to his sister and his brothers, okay. At the start of the conversation he was describing to me how she had hurt him, okay. But then he moved into that. And then he paused and then looked at me, and said, "Oh, Dr. Art, I just want you to know, I'm not changing the subject. I just want you to know that she really hurt me, but she also hurt my sister and my brothers." And then he went back his… his story. And… And I remember that because it's a great example of what the reflective function looks like. It's nothing grand or dramatic. We see it all the time. But if you think about it for a moment, when he paused and said, "Oh, Dr. Art, I'm not changing the subject, I just want you to understand, you know, kind of, what my family was like." To do that, first, he had to be thinking about what was going on between us, and he knew why he was telling me the story, right. He knew what his intension was, his purpose, he knew what he was doing. He also, in his mind, had to have a mental representation of me and what I could be thinking based on his experience with me. And based on that he… you know, must have thought, "Oh, he could be I'm changing the subject, because I'm talking about my sister and brothers and not me, but I'm not. And so I better tell him that." Right. So, to do that, he had to have a reasonable, you know, a reasonably well developed reflective ability to… to have that happen. Okay, so that's kind of how you see that. It's… Right… It's the thinking mind, thinking about yourself. Understanding and empathy to develop a new meaning that leads to new choices of action that lead to healthier functioning. When you're able to reflect on your own motives and other people's motives, what you feel, what they feel, then you can develop new meanings. Right, and that's what we're looking for in treatment, right. We want the parents, right… It's not helpful, I don't think, it's not helpful, if the parents' understanding of their situation is that, "I have a monster in my home and this child is intentionally trying to ruin my life," right. That's not helpful. Okay, and… and… and the meeting we ascribe to events affects how we feel about them and affects what we do. So, if I think my child is a monster who is intentionally trying to make my life difficult, who actually, you know, sits up at night and thinks about, "Hmm, what can I do tomorrow morning to make dad pissed off? I think what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna pick my nose and put blood on the towels, because that will piss him off, right." I'm gonna respond one way when I see that happen, right. And if I have a different conceptualization that, you know, when I get worried, I get anxious and if I pick at myself, that distracts me and it makes me feel better. So, when I find blood on the towels, that must mean my daughter is really upset and something is scaring her. I'm gonna feel differently and respond to that differently, right. Okay, so, reflection leads to thinking about alternative meanings, and can lead to a better, umm… better responses. All right, promoting… it promotes the child's experience of existing in the heart and mind of parent, okay. And then when the parents can do that, it helps the child not feel alone. If you can reflect on their feelings, experiences, motives, intensions, you know, affect and then reflect that back, you know, reflect on it yourself, but then reflect that back, then the child is not alone with their intense feelings. And that's how you organize their experience for them, right. They can't do it for themselves. You must do it for them. Okay, right, and we do that, right, don't we? When a baby is upset, what do we do? Baby is crying, what do you do? You pick him up and what? You pat them on the back, you rock them. You what, calm them down, right. They are now dysregulated, they're crying, they're yelling, you know, they're… they're really unhappy, red in the face, right. You pick them up, you calm them down. You do that for them because they can't do it for themselves. And over time, you know, as we saw this morning, if you keep doing that, they'll learn to that for themselves and then they can do it for themselves. Same thing here, we have to able to reflect the child's experience back to them, so it takes a parent who's able to that, right. Okay, umm… okay, all of that, I think I'll skip that. It's not that important. Umm… right. Your own attachment strategy will, affect that and okay, before I go into sensitivity then, there is one… hopefully this'll work. Okay, what I want to show you is just very briefly, umm… this clip. Uh… is this the… yeah this one, umm… This is a family at the end of treatment, okay. Umm… And you don't really need to know all the background. All I want you to pay attention to is the, umm… the dad in this case, the father, because it's a nice example of insight and reflection, okay. So, it's the, umm… well, it's called… they're called mom and dad, it's really her great uncle and her great aunt who, umm… who are raising her, and she's 16. They've been in treatment for a while. A little curious about, umm… is you are… you are saying Joe that, umm… you know, I might make suggestions or have to think about how to do things better. I was just sort of curious about, that's what I'd like to hear, umm… is umm… I don't think you can put a finger on it, but… but, umm… how did that happen in a way that didn't make you feel either guilty or… or bad about what you have been doing, in other words, I understand what you're saying, I would still try this or when Crystal was this, you might want to think about this. And I'm just wondering, what was it if you could put your finger, that didn't make you feel, "Oh, you know, every time we go there, you criticize, or you know or… or… or blamed or told that nothing we do is right." I'm just curious. 

01:04:55
JOE Well, you know the… for me and the logic that I use is the same things that we were doing with Crystal, we had done with our three previous kids and it worked, it really worked. 

01:05:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah. 

01:05:15
JOE So, we knew that it can't be all bad. 

01:05:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

01:05:20
JOE But, you know, when you give the uh… analogy… 

01:05:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, what I was trying to get at here… I don't know if you could… could you hear it, what he said? Oh, okay, good. Well, what I was really trying to get at, 'cause like find out this from parents that at some point I often do wind up giving a lot of suggestions or ideas and… and I try to be very sensitive. I don't want parents to feel like, "Goddamn it, every time we go there, all he does is tell us to do this, do that," and… and that they wind up feeling, umm… that all that's happening is being, in effect, told they're not doing good job. So I was just curious with him about what was it that happened so he didn't feel that way. Umm… And then, well actually what he then gets into is, umm… another important point, which I think is pretty insightful, is umm… that it's the way that we describe things that's important. We have to find a way to explain things to people within their frame of reference, okay. And you hear that just… just keep in mind as you listen to Joe, that he is an engineer, okay. Just keep that in mind. 

01:06:25
JOE That, you know, the, umm… the bonds and relationships that are in the first two years of life didn't exist for Crystal, and she was a house built on sand, because we had trouble initially. We don't… If we recall, we had trouble understanding why we're giving that love, and affection, and, you know, all these other things. 

01:06:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Years, and for years you… 

01:06:50
JOE Yeah, and… And yet it isn't working, you know, and everything else. So, it was a case where, you know, we didn't know what to do in terms of what was going on, so we were like an open book in that relation, and then we got… 

01:07:00
BARBARA And then we started to learn. 

01:07:05
JOE And… And… And then when you give the, like I said, the analogy that, you know, hers was the house built on sand, so the foundation is crumbling and collapsing, and you need to get that foundation going and build up from there. You know, then there was a case where the door's open now to be opened for anything, and… and for us, there wasn't (inaudible ) that was positive. 

01:07:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

01:07:30
JOE And, you know, as uh… I said that on… I think on our first meeting or so, you know, we had basically three years say, Crystal, was going to be with us. 

01:07:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

01:07:40
JOE Before she left the home and in her current condition, what we saw was her having a… an existence in a cardboard box or whatever. And we knew that she was capable of living better than that and we wanted what was best for her. So in our… and… and… and Barbara, in my mind was a case of, you know, we need to do what it takes to… to make sure that Crystal's gonna be a success, you know, because you want the best for your kids, no matter what you do. 

01:08:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Sure, yeah. 

01:08:10
JOE And… And with that as our primary goal, looking for what's best for Crystal and that she's capable of achieving and doing that stuff, which she is, now more so than ever. You know, there is… that really real guilt on our part, you know, and I'm not sure. 

01:08:30
BARBARA I think we are just, we… we… 

01:08:35
JOE We're more open, we're open to suggestions, 'cause we wanted to… 

01:08:35
BARBARA Yeah. Because we knew what we were doing was not working. 

01:08:40
JOE So, we knew what we were doing… 

01:08:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And you wanted the best for your daughter, so, okay. So… Okay, so that… that's just the clip I wanted to… to show you. Uh… Any questions or comments, umm… about that? 

01:08:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:08:56
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no, it was… it was… it was my metaphor, because I remember when I was meeting with them and, you know, his question was a legitimate one, when they came to me when she was uh… let me think now, about 15 or so. She'd been with them since she was, I think, three and that was their… you know… why is it that everything we've been doing and they've… they've raised three kids very successfully, who are doing really well. What's the problem here? Umm… And they… they… they a lot fighting, of course a lot of anger, because she wasn't the kind of kid she should be. All the things they expected her to do, she couldn't do, I mean, as a 15-year-old could've, but she wasn't really developmentally a 15-year-old. So, they expected her to do something, she couldn't do it. She felt like a bad kid, she'd be… you know, obviously was a bad kid because she couldn't do the things they wanted her to do, they'd get irritated. Umm… And I… I remember what just had flashed to my mind was, "Oh, he's was an engineer, so I've got to think of an analogy that will make sense to him." So the idea of a house, you know, the where the foundation is shaky, it's built on sand, would somehow fit his… and it did, it worked for him, all these analogies for different people. But, so… so we can help people with their reflective function and developing insight by finding ways to explain things in a way that fits their frame of reference. And that worked well with him. Any other comments or questions? Again very, very insightful, and you could see that, and as he thought things, as he reflected, umm… on… on different experiences in treatment, umm… on his expectations for, umm… for his daughter. The other thing, I think it's important or I find interesting, it's important to listen to words, he… he referred to, umm… he talked about "my kids, my other kids", right. It was clear Crystal was part of the whole group. It wasn't, "Crystal and my daughters and son," right, it was my kids. I want the best for your kids, right. And that's important to listen, because there are some… that gets to the commitment piece. When I hear parents talk about, umm… you know, "I've got… I've got three children and then Sarah", umm… that… that's a real red flag, umm… in terms of commitment. Then I need to try to figure out what is that that's going here, why is there that, umm… that that distance, okay. You know. Interesting, my… my youngest, we adopted from China and, umm… you know, every now and then, not so much now. I guess, well, she's 14 now, so won't walk even with me, but when she used to walk with me, umm… sometimes we'd be, like, in the grocery store, you know, get the weirdest comments, like, "Is she yours?" It's like, "No, I picked her up in produce in the back there having this. Yeah, she's mine." Or, you know, the other question I would get sometimes, and I like, you know, joshing people, like I get sometimes. "Oh, is her, umm…" because they'd look at me and say, "Oh, is her mother Chinese?" And I'd say, "I think so," you know, and I was pretty sure, well, you know we didn't know about her background, so it was a guess. She could've been Vietnamese, because the part of China that she was from was really the south part. So, yeah, I think… I think she's Chinese. I think she was. Anyway, okay, uh… oh, we're just getting to be near 3'o clock. We'll take a break. Well, any other questions then before I move on? 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:12:41
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It can be a long question. 

01:12:45
(inaudible) 

01:13:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Candy land… that's isn't really competitive, but it's a… it's… 

01:13:20
UNKNOWN It doesn't necessarily have to be competitive… competitive just in there. 

01:13:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I mean I prefer competitive because I want to… because I prefer an activity, uh… really the thing, umm… the reason I mentioned Candy Land, although it's not overtly competitive, there's only one winner. And that's where you want to see is how what… what we're looking at… now we've got a conflictual situation. You're winning, I'm winning, I'm ahead, you're ahead. How does… How does the parent manage that? If the child's comfortable with it, that's great. But supposing the child is unhappy or… or you know, how does the parent manage that? Again, it's… may be I'll talk a little bit about this. If you're using those four episodes for other purposes, it's just interesting you watch someone doing the umm… teaching activity, right. There are all kinds of ways to teach people things. But quite often I'll be looking at the tape, and you hear the parent, you know, they'll put a couple of blocks down, and they'll say, "Okay, now, you go," and the child picks up a blue block and instead of a red one, right. "No, that's wrong. No, that doesn't go there. No, no that's not right. No, no, it has to go somewhere else." And, you know, you listen to it, you realize what this child's hearing again and again and again is no, no, no versus the parent finding a way to say, "Oh, the child's getting it wrong, how do I coach them in a positive way? Oh, good, yeah, that's the right size. What color is it? Oh this is blue, right. So, what color, oh, that one's red, so you a need a blue one, okay." So there are different ways, so you look at that. 

01:14:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:14:51
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, or as I see actually, fairly frequently, all of a sudden the child's building and telling the parent what to do, okay. And the parent's along with that, okay. I mean, it could be an argument or learning. Or, I was very interesting that I'll… I'll just, umm… do this briefly. So, a mom who came in and primarily issue… primary issue was that her child was very defiant, oppositional, she felt, umm… that she couldn't really control this kid or contain him. And so, you know, when I began working with her, the part of the clip that I showed her, and her kid was every hyperactive too she thought, maybe he had ADD in addition to everything else. Anyway, the part of the tapes that I showed her is when we did… when did the nurturing activity. She was sitting on the couch, and when she is reading the book to her son who's over here, who is… I think he was like five or six, he is like… he is like a Mexican jumping bee, he's all over the place. You know, fidgeting and he wants to grab the book, and all of that. And then all of a sudden, the mom reaches over, puts her arm around him and then holds the book like this, and starts… and continues reading. And all of a sudden, he calmed down, he stopped moving, he started looking at the book, he'd look at her, he'd look at the book. And so I showed her that clip, uh… that piece of that clip to, uh… as a… as a beginning to talk with her about how important it is that she structure his environment to help him be regulated, and that she already knew how to do this, because look how beautifully you did that in this episode, okay. And… And that, you know, that made sense to her then, so rather saying, "Oh, your kid's out of control and it's because you're not doing a good job," right, we could follow… what I was looking for was something that demonstrated that ability, so now she just has to do it more, okay. So, again you can use this stuff in lots of, lots of different ways, beyond just the insightfulness piece if you want. I find it a really rich, rich, uh… tool to use. Yes? 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN Just a brief comment, it might be that the beauty of those, uh… videos, it's also showing the parents the strength they have. 

01:17:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes. 

01:17:05
UNKNOWN This mother is doing that naturally, probably she's not noticing that that is really helping her child. 

01:17:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Exactly. 

01:17:10
UNKNOWN Sometimes they don't notice that, and when someone else from outside let them know that they're doing something really good, and they need to keep doing that because it can help. 

01:17:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right. 

01:17:20
UNKNOWN Is very insightful. 

01:17:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What… What you… What you are really doing when you, did you hear her comment? You know, okay, good. What you… What I think you're really doing when you do that is, umm… you're acting as their reflective function for them. So you're reflecting on their experience thinking about it for them, telling them and again, if we do this… essentially what I'm suggesting I guess is that, whatever you want the parent to do with the child, you need to be able to with the parent, okay. So, we want the parent to be reflective and help the child be reflective then if we can help the parent be more reflective by doing it for them and then doing with them then they'll be able to it for themselves and that's a… that's a good example of just that. You pointed out, they're all ready doing it, but they didn't think about it, they haven't reflected on it. You do it for them, you reflex on it for them. It becomes part of their consciousness, now they can do it more intentionally, okay. Uh… let's then take our, umm… break, umm… we can be back here by 3:15 then we'll be able to get started by 3:30 as the schedule says and I'll put those references back up here if anybody wants to, umm… uh… copy them.
