MARY BRADFORD IVEY This is all about coaching and microcounseling about -- I want to find out who you are as a group, how many of -- how many identify as counselors here, raise your hand if you are a counselor. Great, that's what is our great majority. Are you psychologists, clinical psychologists, anybody, school counselors, school counselors, private practice, no one looks like private practice and counselors, great, great. How about professors, educators -- oh we've got some professors here, good, great, see you. How many are -- what -- oh, how many already identify yourself as a coach, how many already see yourself as a coach, okay, look at all the coaches we have already. Oh, I better put you coaches all together to coach each other. Okay, I'll call on you for -- you are my resource people here. Okay, this is coaching microcounseling. Allen here and I had read about coaching for sometime, but finally we decided to find out what really coaching was all about, so where did we go, we are in Massachusetts and we decided to attend a two-day Harvard University workshop with some of the best people in the country. What we found was surprising and not surprising. Our take on this is that we know the counseling skills, all of us here; many of us are counselors and thus immediately all they did in coaching made a lot of sense. 

00:01:35
Coaching Can Add to 

00:01:35
Counseling 

00:01:35
Effective counseling requires us to be a coach. The 

00:01:35
art of coaching belongs in counseling. 

00:01:35
Coaching uses the same skills as microcounseling 

00:01:35
and counseling. 

00:01:35
NOT PROBLEM ORIENTED, FOCUS ON 

00:01:35
STRENGTHS, RESCOURCES, AND GOALS 

00:01:35
Word "coaching" may be more acceptable to many 

00:01:35
clients 

00:01:35
Coaching already part of counseling, but not 

00:01:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY In fact, they use lot of the language that we use daily, listening skills are central in the work that they do and we are very good listeners as you know. As the days went along, we realized that much of what we do in counseling as coaching but we use different names. Nonetheless, there are some distinctions and we all as counselors can learn from the coaching movement, we have the skills and the knowledge but we need to consider using what we know differently. So this session, one session is not gonna make you a coach and perhaps we do have coaches here already. But it's gonna outline some of the basics of coaching and prepare you for the next steps, if you want to follow-up. Maybe you just want to learn about coaching. So in this workshop, we will give special attention to how microcounseling, this is the work that Allen and I have done for years, years and many of you -- how many have used an IV textbook some place along the way, so you might have heard a microcounseling and you have might have heard some of these things. Anyway, how microcounseling relates to coaching. I'll outline some of the basics and then we will see a video, but this time we will stop and start the video, DVD so that we can examine and then practice specific skills, this is a micro-training way of doing it, we'll see a video and then we'll stop and practice the particular skills. So here we have a slide, it's just before I left. Can I have the next slide? 

00:03:00
The word "coaching" can take the 

00:03:00
stigma out of helping 

00:03:00
Coaches say: "Counselors can get you from unwell (-10 to 0), 

00:03:00
while coaches move from you from neutral to peak performance (0 

00:03:00
to +10)." Their positive orientation needs to be listened to. 

00:03:00
But, coaches read the "Cliff Notes" from superior counseling 

00:03:00
programs 

00:03:00
You already have skills to be a life coach - think about it! 

00:03:00
Nonetheless, the word "coaching" will appeal to many clients. 

00:03:00
(More positive language for many who fear shrinks.) 

00:03:00
With some thought and reading, you many even want to become a 

00:03:00
professional coach yourself and describe yourself as a 

00:03:00
"counselor/coach." 

00:03:00
BUT, save the money it costs for certification. 

00:03:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Just before I left I read the Counseling Today journal and the fellow who wrote the article, the word coaching can take the stigma out of helping and I thought you know in some ways coaching has a bit of -- I mean counseling can have a bit of stigma, but coaching sounds pretty positive, coaches say, counselors can get you from unwell minus 10 to 0, while the coaches move you from neutral to peak performance, 0 to 10 plus, their positive orientation needs to be listened to. But we think coaches read the cliff notes from the superior counseling program, a lot of what they do in coaching is what we do in counseling and you already have the skills to be a life coach, think about it, that's what we do, we have life coaches. Nonetheless, coaching will appeal to many clients because of the positive language and people think, oh you're going to counseling, you must have some problems, you know, or anything that goes with counseling goes with the shrink -- they feel the shrinks. But with some thought and reading you may want to become -- you might know, you want to become a professional coach yourself and maybe describe yourself a counselor coach, use your counseling skills and describe yourself as a counseling coach and maybe some of you do that already. But if you are gonna go be a coach, sometimes they have to pay for certification, I'm giving you free certification here, get your own certification, costs a lot sometimes to join up and be part of these programs which we think should be part of counseling anyway. Okay, so we might want to consider the term counseling coaching as they are so closely related. Same skills involved but used differently, it’s not coaching, it's not problem-oriented. Here is my assistant right here, my trust -- my trusty assistant. I think we just get near technology and everything just starts -- somebody said they have the vibrations around technology and it just goes crazy, I think that's what happens to us, we get a little crazy. 

00:05:05
ALLEN IVEY I must have brought the wrong set of slides. 

00:05:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What? You brought the wrong set of slides, oh my gosh, coaching counseling. Keep looking for it, okay. Effective counseling requires us to be a coach, okay, related same social problems, but used differently, not problem oriented and I really like their emphasis on strengths because that what we've been talking about earlier in our workshop that we did pre-compass workshop, what we talked about this morning. Strengths, resources, goals, I like that positive approach, they don't talk much about problems, they don't talk about problems but rather about goals, opportunities for growth, I love that language. Career counseling does a lot of coaching skills but the term is not always used and when we do academic counseling or school career counseling or work teaching children and teen social skills, we are moving to coaching orientation. So I think already we are using some of those coaching orientations in our work as counselors. Assigning homework to clients, things to do at home, often involves coaching skills, and we don't often do that as much in counseling as we should, so I like that orientation with coaching. So, coaching is seeking to become more professional and we are pleased with the International Coaching Federation. 

00:06:20
International Coaching 

00:06:20
Federation 

00:06:20
The ICF defines coaching as partnering with clients in a 

00:06:20
thought-provoking and creative process that inspires 

00:06:20
them to maximize their personal and professional 

00:06:20
potential. www.coachfederation.org 

00:06:20
Seeks professionalism and ethics 

00:06:20
Credentialing and core competencies 

00:06:20
Code of ethnics 

00:06:20
Examination 

00:06:20
Many good people seeking to improve the 

00:06:20
profession 

00:06:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY This is the statement that they used to define coaching, which I think a very nice statement. The ICF defines coaching as partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. Now who doesn't want to maximize their personal and professional potential, I think it’s a very good, they also have very good ethic statements on this site, that's their site www.coachfederation.org, well worth taking a look at because of their ethic statements. We talk about dual relationships and they talk about conflict of interest, I like that too. They may be equally important term but even more important than dual relationships, they seek to credential professional coaches, complete with examination and they are many good people at this Harvard workshop and there is also a fellow from the University of Sydney, they are all seeking to work on improving the profession. But it is a new profession and as we see some of the issues in coaching, now I don't know who it is here, they have no regulation, no licensing and very little professional training, they are moving towards that way but it’s just not all there yet. 

00:07:25
What are some issues with 

00:07:25
coaching? 

00:07:25
No regulation, no licensing, little professional 

00:07:25
training 

00:07:25
Anyone can call themselves a coach, even with NO 

00:07:25
training! 

00:07:25
Many charlatans and dishonest coaches 

00:07:25
Little research justification 

00:07:25
BUT, MANY USEFUL CONCEPTS TO EXPAND OUR 

00:07:25
PRACTICE 

00:07:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Anyone can call themselves a coach, even with no training at all. So, and there are some charlatans and very dishonest coaches, so you have to be very, very careful about that. There is little research justification, although Tony Grant, the fellow from University of Sydney is doing some of the best work in the world. So his work is worth looking at and if you wanted to attend more workshops, I would -- he would be one person that I would look to, I'm sure there is other people and you people that are coaches would know the top people here in Australia. Anyway, there are many useful concepts in coaching that we can use to expand our -- even our counseling practice. So coaching can add to counseling, this slide summarizes what I've been saying that is positive about coaching. 

00:08:10
Relation Coaching to 

00:08:10
Counseling 

00:08:10
GOAL ORIENTED, NOT PROBLEM-ORIENTED (Brief therapy similar) 

00:08:10
More emphasis on strengths, resources, and attaining goals 

00:08:10
More emphasis on action: taking learning to the real world 

00:08:10
Uses microskills in similar fashion to counseling and therapy 

00:08:10
Requires a knowledgeable Counselor/Coach, often more 

00:08:10
specialized who listens, encourages, gives information, 

00:08:10
direction, provides useful feedback 

00:08:10
Example CC issues: career, health, retirement, life skills, 

00:08:10
spiritual, divorce, family, college admissions, dealing with 

00:08:10
illness, retirement 

00:08:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  I think effective counseling requires us to be a coach, the art of coaching belongs in the field of counseling. Coaching uses the same skills as microskills and counseling not problem-oriented, focused on strengths, resources and goals, the word coaching may be more acceptable to many clients, I'm going to a coach rather than to a counselor, might be acceptable. And we think coaching is already part of counseling which is just not recognized. Okay, a major strength of coaching is that it focuses far more on goals than counseling does. Microcounseling gives central attention to clear cut goals as cognitive behavioral theory often does, but too much of counseling can wander without purpose or direction, where are we dear, are we losing it? 

00:09:00
ALLEN IVEY  Go ahead. You are doing fine, I know it. 

00:09:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  That's my assistant, oh dear. Coaching is very good at generalizing an action from each session, something that we too often let go. Albert Ellis' homework emphasis was a breakthrough but action is more standard in coaching. Uses microskills a similar fashion, requires knowledge. The one thing about being a coach, you have to have knowledge in specific area like, someone came and told me she was a fitness coach, you have to know something about fitness, I mean she know the coaching skills but she has got to know about fitness or she has to know about, if she wants to be a health coach, she got to know about health, or if you want to be a career person, a career coach, you better know something about career, so you have the process is similar to counseling but you've got to know this content over here, maybe retirement coaching you want to specialize, you've got to know a lot of about retirement. So you have to be able to specialize and you can't know all those different areas, you got to sort of decide what area you would like to specialize in. Okay, I'm past that. 

00:10:05
ALLEN IVEY Don't worry about it. 

00:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I'm past that. I'm -- I'm -- 

00:10:05
ALLEN IVEY Maybe I'll just retire. 

00:10:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I was at did you do coaching, can I add, I'm relating coaching to counseling. Where are you? Oh wait, here we are, Mary and Allen's Bottom line. See, I cannot think and organize and then do this at the same time, so I have to take my assistant along but my assistant has difficulties too, okay, anyway. Where are we here? 

00:10:35
Allen and Mary's Bottom 

00:10:35
Line 

00:10:35
Counseling should take over coaching and develop 

00:10:35
our own training and certification standards. 

00:10:35
Counseling's research backs up much of what good 

00:10:35
coaching teaches. 

00:10:35
We have the skills and can identify as counseling/ 

00:10:35
coaches 

00:10:35
One to three courses and serious in-service training 

00:10:35
would allow coaches to be certified, by academic 

00:10:35
programs or in-service courses. 

00:10:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, our bottom line, we think that counseling should take over coaching and develop our own training and certification standards. Now that's just an idea to pass on to you in Australia, I don't know if it's going to happen in the States, sometime it's too big and we all need to do something but I think it should be an umbrella, we think it should be an umbrella out of the counseling program. Counseling's research backs up much of what's good about the coaching, what coaching teaches. And we have the skills and can identify as counseling coaches and I see Carol smiling down there, she has done some of the research in this area, yeah look at that. One -- we think one to three courses and serious in-service training would allow coaches to be certified, by academic programs or in-service courses. That's what our bottom line is and that's what we are thinking about. So, I don't know how you folks have gotten trained in different ways, but I think a really good counseling program could also add the arm of coaching. Okay, relationship is of course central in both coaching and in microskills. For intel, we have a good working relationship, nothing much will happen. Model I'm gonna work with today is called the grow model, it doesn't mention relationship but it is obviously important, it doesn't really bringing out, but we still think it's important and we would include relationship. Through listening skills, we draw out the clients' goals in coaching, just like coaching, we'd prefer story, issue, concern or even challenge to the word problem. The word problem has negative connotations and there is assumptions that problems can be solved, there is no cure for life.

4. Restory 

00:12:10
5. Action 

00:12:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, here we have our microskills hierarchy and you've seen this, those of you who've had the text books. We need to listen for strengths and anchor those strengths in the body, if you know where you -- if you don't know where you are going, you may end up somewhere else, there needs to be a reason for the session and goals set directly. So, what we used to call problem solving and expiration, we are not calling restoring, coaching calls it options, what happens is not all that different, but we now seek a clear positive story on which clients can build and change. So we are similar to coaching there. Finally, action, many of us is tired at the end of a session and we just want it to end. Generalization and homework is essential if the story is to be enacted and change to be taken home. And in coaching, and this particular model, this is coaching's way forward. So you can see the different things that we have certainly these are all, you're very familiar with microskills hierarchy, all the different skills that we have that are used in coaching and then you see the relationship story and strengths, goals, restory action very similar to model and coaching and what we are going to be talking about today. So, and I'm also gonna just mention this next slide is about mentoring. People have asked me about mentoring, what's the difference. 

00:13:30
What about Mentoring? 

00:13:30
FORMAL DEFINITION OF MENTOR 

00:13:30
Synonyms - guide, teacher, coach, adviser, tutor, 

00:13:30
instructor, counselor, guru 

00:13:30
Thus mentors use coaching skills, but often take a more 

00:13:30
instructional role. 

00:13:30
Mentors may be assigned and the "client" can be 

00:13:30
resistant, then counseling skills are critical 

00:13:30
Mentoring is different from coaching, but the concepts 

00:13:30
and strategies would help. 

00:13:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY There is a formal definition of mentoring, but look at the many words that are associated with the concept, guide, teacher, coach, adviser, tutor, instructor, counselor, guru. More teaching with mentoring, more of an expert novel -- novice relationship, so a little bit different than coaching the mentoring is, but people have asked about that, they are similar but I think that mentors, mentors may be assigned or people who are coached usually ask for independently, you are usually as you're a student, you are assigned to a mentor or an internship, you've got a mentor working with you, so it's more of an assigned thing. And we think that mentoring could profit from looking at the often more positive orientation and goal direction and action associated with coaching because sometimes mentoring comes in and can be a little bit negative. Things you need to improve on and can be like negative feedback, so we think that they might learn from the coaching model. 

00:14:20
Excellent Coaching 

00:14:20
often focuses on values 

00:14:20
It often asks questions such as: 

00:14:20
"What is your vision?" 

00:14:20
"What legacy do you want to leave to the 

00:14:20
world? 

00:14:20
Let's listen to Viktor Frankl on values, but first 

00:14:20
let us look at how values can change over 

00:14:20
the lifespan 

00:14:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Change. I've got expert coaching, often I got this, expert coaching often focuses on values, it often asks questions such as what is your vision? What legacy do you want to leave the world? The coaching model we're going to work with today is oriented to values and to vision. What does a client want to make of their lives? What are their deeper purposes? We met with Viktor Frankl in Vienna, who before our lecturing in Jagiellonian University and I'm going to show you some of his comments. Let me show you this cartoon first and then I'll do a little bit more about Viktor Frankl. This shows about values, I just kind of read this to you. This is another Doonesbury cartoon by Garry Trudeau. And here is a banker, this has to do with vision, look at, here is our banker, our U.S. banker, the banker progress, he gets, he graduates and says I hope to do something of value and be fairly paid, as he starts out from graduation, gets his diploma. And then, little more data, I'd like to be paid for doing something of value fairly well and then I want to be valued and paid fairly well for doing something. And then he is in big Wall Street office looking over New York City, I desired to be paid well for doing something of no value, and then there he is Chairman of the Board, I demand to be paid obscenely well for destroying value. And then he goes back to his alma mater always hold to your values. So, now the person that talks most about -- I think value and meanings in discerning life goals is Viktor Frankl. 

00:16:10
Viktor Frank 

00:16:10
l 

00:16:10
Values and meaning in 

00:16:10
discerning life goals 

00:16:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  And as I was saying, we were lecturing in the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland and next day we also went to Auschwitz, oh, my goodness, if those of you've been to the concentration camps, you know what a powerful experience it is. And the next day, after being in Auschwitz, we flew to Vienna to spend two hours with Viktor Frankl, this was a very powerful meeting. What stood out for me was what he said, there was one sentence, the best of us did not survive and indeed he survived because, first of all, he is tough, he is not a warm fuzzy, he kind of a cold prickly because of that but also because he had meaning and vision, the meaning was that if you read Man's Search for Meaning, he wanted to be with his wife and he was so, they were so close and he wanted to be with her, he wanted to be you know meet with her again and he also found meaning by helping other people, so he found meaning in a very terrible, awful situation, and that way he was able to make meaning for his life and that's really the critical issue in counseling and therapy is helping clients to find meaning and get through their very difficult situations and who can have a more difficult situation than Viktor Frankl in that situation. So, let's take a look at -- we have a just short video, don't have 'em. We have a short video of Viktor Frankl and some of his key points, now his -- 

00:17:45
 -- sort of controlled by drives and instincts and maybe it would be better for him if you were, you wouldn't have the same problems -- 

00:17:50
VIKTOR FRANKL Of course and it's a characteristic of new uptick existence that one thrives to get rid of one's freedom of choice and one thrives to just dare to intoxicate oneself by the way of pleasure seeking, actually, basically man is not concerned with pleasure of power, the will to power what I'm used to calling the will to pleasure is nothing original and primary, but rather a will to meaning as I'm used to calling it, this means man is basically concerned with finding and fulfilling a meaning in life, and if this search for meaning is frustrated, the noogenic neurosis, the feeling of meaninglessness results. 

00:18:35
 How will the supply for example of the increasing violence that we see today? 

00:18:40
VIKTOR FRANKL You see, when there is a feeling of meaninglessness, people do meaningless things, they resort to crime, to violence because the will to power exaggerated, you see lived out without restrain in violence, the will to power as well as the will to pleasure are substitutes for the frustrated will to meaning. The will to meaning, one's search for meaning is the original concern, and only a man who has been frustrated in this basic will to meaning then resorts either to power seeking or to pleasure seeking, and the crudest, most brutal form of power seeking of living out one's search for power is violence and on the other hand, this pleasure seeking the so-called pursuit of happiness is not only contradicting one's primary will to meaning but is more it shows it appears to be self defeating, it is the very pursuit of pleasure of happiness, that towards happiness because happiness is -- occurs as a byproduct as a side effect of finding and fulfilling a meaning or loving another being, another human being. 

00:20:05
Frankl's Key Points 

00:20:05
Questioning the meaning of life is not neurotic, it is a human 

00:20:05
achievement. It is our central concern. 

00:20:05
Finding meaning is central. We are not controlled by drives or 

00:20:05
the need for power. 

00:20:05
Meaninglessness can load to violence and crime. 

00:20:05
The "pursuit of happiness" and personal gain (wealth, power) 

00:20:05
will ultimately fail. We always want MORE! 

00:20:05
MEANING NEEDS TO A CENTRAL ISSUES IN COACHING AND 

00:20:05
ALSO IN COUNSELING. 

00:20:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Okay, was that good. 

00:20:10
 Yeah. 

00:20:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, here's -- can I put this on and here are some points that we'd like to make that I'm sure -- does anybody have comments, did you pick out what he was saying? Or just take a look up here. What his key points are. Questioning the meaning of life is not neurotic, it's human achievement. It is our central concern to look at the meaning of life. Finding meaning is central. We are not controlled by our drives or our need for power. Meaninglessness can lead to violence and crime and he talked about that. The pursuit of happiness and personal gain you know like this Wall Street guy that I just showed you, forget it, will ultimately fail because there is no end to desire, we always want more. Meaning needs to be a central issue in coaching and also in counseling. So meaning is very important and I think the idea of meaning comes right from Viktor Frankl, he is a good model. Now I would like to talk about the grow model, which we'll be working on today and you will have a chance to try some things. 

00:21:10
The Grow Model 

00:21:10
(Carol Kaufmann) 

00:21:10
USEFUL INTERVIEW STRUCTURE 

00:21:10
G=goal. What positive goal does the client seek? 

00:21:10
R=reality. What is the client's present situation and strengths to 

00:21:10
help toward the goal(s)? 

00:21:10
O=Options. How can the client AND coach generate possible ways 

00:21:10
to reach the goal? 

00:21:10
W=Way forward. How to we act on goals, measure success, and 

00:21:10
maintain changes over time? 

00:21:10
Carol Kaufmann's Powerful Questions in red 

00:21:10
as we continue 

00:21:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  The grow model will be familiar to you as I describe it, different words but concepts are very recognizable. I'll go through the slide a little bit in detail, this is Carol Kaufmann's Grow Model. There are many different models, we thought this was a good one that match with our microskills, so I thought that might be a model that we could use in our short hour and a half together and so that we come away learning something. G, coaching starts with goals, very similar to brief therapy. You'll have goals, if you don't know where you are going, you may end up some place else. Thus the front loading on vision for life or whatever issue the client presents, whatever they want to talk about, whatever they want to present, what is their ideal solution, what do they want to be, that's the ultimate question, you are gonna be asking, you wanna know about what is your vision is for life or your passion is and we see a video today, we are gonna show Allen with a student, finding their passion, finding their direction. And then there has got to be a reality check, what is the client's present situation and strengths to help towards the goal. And then we'd look at options, client and coach working together to find the goal, coaches are much more likely to give advice and provide information to counselors. That's where one of the differences is right there, they are experts in certain areas, so there is going to be more advice giving and information, but they certainly are going to combine that with lots and lots of listening. And then they are gonna look for a way forward, we prefer the word action but way forward is fine. Coaching is very concerned about doing something, to take action even after every interview. This is something we all need to think about as counselors. So you can notice the similarities between the grow model and microcounseling's five stage interview, very, very similar. The relationship part, explicit, implicit, goals, set up early goals, reality we call it story and strengths. Options, we review goals, we restory the problem and they go way forward and we do action generalization very similar to -- very similar to our counseling model but just a little bit variation. Okay, let's look at relationship.

MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, let's see where we are. Well, let's see, where are you? Okay, so, no right now I would like to have them, we are going to be doing that. Right now, I'd like to have you pair-up, you've got someone I sort of told you when you'd come into find you pair, find someone that doesn't have a pair, so you might like to sit together where we don't be exactly a cozy, it isn't exactly a real perfect environment, but you kind of bend your chair, turn your chair slightly, so you could look towards each other, because we are gonna do some work together, we'll -- now you have to be able to see the screen too, so you don't wanna turn too much, you can sort of slightly turn and then you can watch the screen and then we'll be working with your client at the same time, so. Does everybody have a -- everybody have a partner. And you might think -- just visit a minute, you might chat a bit about which of you wants to be the coach today and who has a concern or you know just something they might want to needs some coaching on, maybe you need help in some coaching on some particular issue. So you can decide right now, just take a minute or two and decide. 

00:24:40
Refer to Video Booklet 

00:24:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Okay, okay I may have everybody face up here. One thing about turning counselors lose to talk after they have been sitting all day, they have a lot to say, counselors and the coaches. You will also on your -- in your booklet pad, I'm gonna refer you to page 47 and just see 48 has some of the questions, 47, 48, and 49 has the material that you'll need actually just 47, 48. You can take a look at the things we're talking about and you can have that right here, and the questions that we are going to be asking, the powerful coaches questions will be on 40 -- page on 48. Now what we are gonna do, we've just got page 48, I looked around, looks like everybody has got a partner, we are all set, is anybody lose here not with a partner. I think we're all paired up, how did that happen. Okay, now I gonna show a video of Allen demonstrating the basics of the Grow Model and Carol Kaufmann's key question. 

00:25:45

MICROTRAINING 

00:26:05
ALLEN IVEY Here we integrate the idea of coaching profession into the interview process, counseling is definitely not coaching but there is some dimensions of that area that we can really find helpful. We discussed this in our intentional interviewing and counseling and that is part of training program and as we get into all these influencing skills that really is a coaching process that goes along and I'll turn to Jennifer, I'd like to explain to you a little about more about coaching as we start. Coaching really is a back and forth, almost more egalitarian relationship but the focus is very much on your goals, we don't worry about theory, and there is some specific questions they ask, and I think it's going to be a little new to most people, so I'm actually going to open the book and I recommend that people will also make this available handout, people have sort of the structure but -- of coaching session, the goal today in about 15 minutes at most to demonstrate a few of the basic principals of coaching, needless to say relationship is really essential to coaching, just like in counseling and we are going to have to assume to move along a little faster that we spent some time in developing relationship. And we've talked, we kind of know where we are going and how it is. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:50
This is a short demonstration of 

00:27:50
COACHING'S GROW MODEL. 

00:27:50
A full hour would be necessary 

00:27:50
for full exploration. 

00:27:50
G: GOALS: Vision and meaning 

00:27:50
R: REALITY: Story and strengths 

00:27:50
O: OPTIONS: Maximize alternatives 

00:27:50
W: WAY FORWARD: Commitment 

00:27:50
to action immediately 

00:27:50
ALLEN IVEY You've also been kind enough to share a general issue that you'd like to work on. And just as we -- I think we really might begin with you sharing that issue that you'd like to explore from a coaching frame of reference. 

00:28:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Sure, I've seen recently struggling with the or wrestling I should say with the decision to either graduate with my Masters and look for employment or move directly into doctorial program. So that's a hefty decision and one that I -- I'm not taking lightly but the time is -- is approaching where I would either need to start looking at applications for doctorial program or let things naturally play out for the job search process. 

00:28:35
ALLEN IVEY Now the counseling situation I really would draw out at this point more on the issue between these two. What coaching does, it tends to focus first of all in the interview goals, I like to know what are your goals? 

00:28:50
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI  Well, what I thought might goals were before entering the Masters program have somebody evolved but my goal still remain true to the initial thought of influencing children, I'd like to be a school counselor and bring what life experience I have in passion for diversity awareness to the schools. So moving along -- 

00:29:20
ALLEN IVEY I hear that passion for diversity awareness that interested in kids and I even see your -- I love when your eyes light up in the process so we look at really what your goal is and I think this is where coaching has some interesting thing to say as if we can lie to you where we want to go, some of the things may fall. But why does this vision matter to you and by the way as people practice this particular first time. 

00:29:50
Watch for coaching's 

00:29:50
9 Powerful Questions 

00:29:50
ALLEN IVEY You are comfortable to have the book with you or have a list of questions, but why does this vision of the future matter to you, the passion. 

00:29:55
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well because it will fuel both the drive for what I would pursue in a profession either influencing children or influencing others that may go into a profession with the children and I think that it's contagious when you feel passionate about something and you love what you do, others find that energizing and are able to -- 

00:30:20
ALLEN IVEY And I even get a little energy from you as I see the spark on your eye when you see that vision and that goal. And that really helps me understand what you might want to do, so that's what they call the goal. 

00:30:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay, let's stop right there, shall we. So you can see we develop a relationship -- 

00:30:40
ALLEN IVEY Then it's called -- it is also called Grow Model, that's the goal. Listen to reality what stops your hand --. 

00:30:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY How do we stop this. Wait, wait, wait, stop, we have to stop this. 

00:30:55
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Sure, I think that my strength is relating to others, listening to others. 

00:31:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I need two technicians. 

00:31:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI And if I -- 

00:31:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Two technicians. Why just take two. Oh my, what you may remember about this workshop with Iveys is that oh my god, they are so terrible at technical stuff, why you just sent 'em home. I think I need some, I need some coaching on technical stuff, I do indeed. Okay, so you can see she -- he is working with graduate student using Carol Kaufmann's questions, develop relationship, what -- some of the questions you might ask, you might ask what is the ideal person you want to be, your best self, what is the gap between now and your vision and why does this vision matter to you, those are some of the questions, heavy-duty questions right at the beginning, looking at goals but when you are working with your person who wants to be coached, what you call him coachee or a client, or a I don't know what you want to call it, anyway the coach can ask, experiment with some of these questions in this first stage and see how it goes. 

00:32:00
G: GOAL 

00:32:00
Develop relationship and set early goal. "What would 

00:32:00
you like to accomplish today? (or in our talks?) 

00:32:00
"What is the ideal person you want to be? Your best 

00:32:00
self? 

00:32:00
"What is the gap between the now and your vision? 

00:32:00
"Why does this vision matter to you? 

00:32:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  And then we will go onto the next stage, we'll just take it step by step but try different questions and see how your client responds to you. Do you all know who your -- let me have the coaches raise their hand, you are the coach, okay. And then we have the clients, okay, let's say about, what about five minutes, three minutes, three minutes, three or four minutes just to get the story out and begin your process, three minutes go ahead. Okay, let's come back as a group and process what we've done so far, you get to go back to your partner pretty soon, we're going step by step, I'm looking now for comments, issues, questions from the group. Comments, issues, questions based on what we did just this first section, let's hear from the groups, we can hear, learn from each other, and some of your coaches might have some comments too, okay, go ahead. 

00:32:55
 He instructed to add missed reality in what it was, two minutes? 

00:33:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY In two minutes. 

00:33:00
 Yeah, I thought it was. 

00:33:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Everybody needs a coach. 

00:33:05
 Yeah. 

00:33:05
 I just want to say the same thing, the goal came very clear. 

00:33:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY The goal came quick and nothing like asking for it, just boom like that. 

00:33:10
  It was. 

00:33:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Any other comments, observations, questions. Yes? 

00:33:15
 (inaudible ). 

00:33:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It helped you to focus on what you need to do. Brought in a focus. Anybody else, comments, issues, questions, how did this feel? I was thinking when Allen asked question, why, I was used to thinking counseling, we don't like to use a why question, that's a little acquainted. 

00:33:35
 It's not encouraging at all. 

00:33:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's not even encouraging coaching and I realized its in Carol Kaufmann's model, I just realized that's on the notes, I've reading a very good book that I would highly recommend, we haven't written a book on this at all, it's our in book, in our text book, a small section of it, but this is by psychology mail by Margaret Moore and Bob Moran and they also speak to the why question, so, we had a why question in there but it seemed to work, she was a little bit defensive, oh yes, it's called Coaching Psychology Manual, yes you may speak to the why question, Allen would like to speak to the why question. 

00:34:15
ALLEN IVEY I want to -- 

00:34:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You can come to -- 

00:34:20
ALLEN IVEY It's nice. 

00:34:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Why don't you go on this side. 

00:34:20
ALLEN IVEY Okay, I want to speak to the why question briefly. In our book, we coach Viktor Frankl who quotes Niche, the person who has a why, will find the how, as soon as you move into meaning, we're looking at the why of life, why, not so good in many situation but why do you want to have why -- oops why. 

00:34:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Why did you turned it off. 

00:34:45
ALLEN IVEY  Why am I -- and I -- 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:34:55
ALLEN IVEY  I'm so bad I can't even talk. To me -- 

00:35:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, we need new coaching, we need coaching- 

00:35:05
ALLEN IVEY My time with Frankl was very previous to both of us and the thing is that, meeting is a why question, how to live comes from that, so coaching, once -- one of the things I do like about coaching is, what's your vision rather than what's your problem, a big difference in the questions, why then -- oh that's your vision, oh why is that important to you, so it's a different thing, we got to add, link about thing just a little bit differently. 

00:35:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Okay, any other comments, questions from the group. Yes? 

00:35:35
 It's really important to -- 

00:35:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Maybe I'll bring the bring the microphone. Allen bring me the microphone. Allen bring the microphone. 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay, I will take it back. 

00:35:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Right over there. 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY I can at least do this. 

00:35:50
 It was really important to me to find the vision to see my client just had the moment of lifting and change the interview because now we were both onto a common goal and she was really now, oh yeah, I want to go there. 

00:36:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Okay. Any more -- one more comment before we move on. Here is another, back there on. I think we can also -- we learn a lot by talking together to, so that's why I have to stop and start. 

00:36:20
 A couple of questions that I often ask, what would I see and what would I hear you doing once you reached your vision, I'm just getting really somebody in the mind then. 

00:36:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  What you see here almost coming from our DCT questions that we asked in sensorimotor what you see, what you hear, what do you feel, yeah, would work well. Okay. 

00:36:45
ALLEN IVEY I would add just one thing, Mary and I, when we first moved to Sarasota, Florida, that was the early stages of retirement, when you get retired, we actually -- you --actually I've coached to help you plan, my god this is totally different, so what if -- tell them about the church. 

00:37:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  We went to a church session, they had a discernment, what you discern, what -- basically what you discerning what your life mission is it what the purpose of your life is. And, you know we went through all these sessions and studied the Bible and did all this and that and by the time we got done, Alan decided that we might -- both of us sort of said, well I guess we might as well just continue what we're doing, because this is really what's fun, this is what gives us energy and this is what's fun for us. We just want to do it on a little slower basis. And I like to travel, see places, do workshops but then I like to have fun. So, I planned the fun part. So after we leave here, we have to work at Singapore. But then, our fun part of this trip is, was to do the Orient Express across from Singapore to Bangkok. Guess what, Bangkok is right now underwater. We've already paid for Orient Express. So they might get us partly on the Orient Express and then they're gonna fly us, I guess, to Bangkok. And then we can't go to Bangkok. We're gonna have some sort of rigmarole, we're gonna go to Chiang Mai I guess or something else. Then we've gotta figure out how to go back Bangkok, if it's not underwater because they've got banks all around it. I'll be so happy to get back to Australia. So, my fun plan is totally ought to be a bit of a nightmare. But we do have fun doing this. So that's -- but we want a coach helping us, you know, with this retirement, because, you know, we're flat out working at the university and doctoral students and meetings and all that stuff. And it's a change when you finally retire. So that, we're sort of moving into. I think we're really failed retirement. We're sort of moving into -- whatever. 

00:38:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:38:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, she does this -- this is kind of interesting. 

00:38:50
 (inaudible ). 

00:38:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Which -- this is good. 

00:38:55
 That's the top of coaching. I do maturized transitions coaching because it is a change but also to the concept of retirement is changing. So, what is retirement now, is not what it looks like now, it's not what it used to be. 

00:39:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, that's right. 

00:39:10
 So -- oh, they also call it third eye, that sort of thing. But here it's a -- 

00:39:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you do different things different. Sometimes you do more of the same. And -- 

00:39:15
 Specializing with mature age group, who'll undergo whole range of transitions, not just into -- to -- 

00:39:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So there if you wanna retire here, here is your coach right here. Anybody ready to retire, there she is. She'll help with your retirement. Okay, let's us move on to the next stage. Okay. And Reality, Story and Strength. 

00:39:40
R: Reality, Story, and Strengths 

00:39:40
What strengths can your use to help you get there? 

00:39:40
What is the key challenge? (not problem- 

00:39:40
CHALLENGE!) 

00:39:40
How do your strengths and resources relate to this 

00:39:40
OPENING FOR GROWTH? 

00:39:40
FOCUS ON POSITIVE STRENGTHS AND 

00:39:40
RESOURCES THAT THE CLIENT HAS TO REACH 

00:39:40
GOALS AND SOLVE PROBLEMS 

00:39:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What strengths can you use to help you get there? What strengths do you have? Now you're gonna be focusing on client's strengths. And what is the key challenge? Let's not use the word problem. What's the key challenge to get to where you wanna go. And how do your strengths and resources relate to this opening for growth? Focus on positive strengths. This what we've been talking about, the prefrontal cortex and identify those resources that the client has to reach the goals and to solve the problems. So, let's take a look at Jennifer and Allen. And she's making a decision. 

00:40:20
2. THE GROWTH MODEL: 

00:40:20
REALITY 

00:40:20
ALLEN IVEY  Then let's call -- that's also called the GROW model. What's the goal? Let's look at reality. What strengths do you have that'll help you get to that goal? Tell me about your strengths. 

00:40:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Sure. I think that my strength is relating to others, listening to others. 

00:40:40
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-uhm, you're a good listener, you relate to others. 

00:40:40
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI And if I were to apply those strengths in a school counseling role, I think that, I'd be quite an effective school counselor in high school setting, which is what I appreciate myself doing before I become this far into my Masters program. I also think that those schools could be beneficial pursuing a doctoral degree and influencing others in the future that well. 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY So real part of your goal is kids, but you also ought to influence others to be. I think I sense a same passion of not just you, but to bring along other people with this. 

00:41:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Uhm. 

00:41:15
ALLEN IVEY  Ah-hah. And you see that as one of your strengths? 

00:41:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Uhm. 

00:41:20
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:41:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I also think I find learning opportunities and places that aren't necessarily so conventional. 

00:41:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And this is what the R in the role model, it's realities. So part of the reality is the strengths. And notice, as we do coaching model, we're not talking the problem. We're starting to put your vision and then what your strengths. And next one in the list here is, what is the key challenge? 

00:41:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Uhm. Moving forward toward x number of years into a doctoral program or jumping into a school counseling profession? So making that decision, I'm wrestling with where do I see myself. I think that the end result of either path would be drastically different, although maintaining different component of things that I'm very interested and passionate about, I'd rather be working in a school with high school students or I'd be pursuing my education further and wherever that may take me in the research and profession. 

00:42:25
ALLEN IVEY So that you really feel, you're strong -- strongly feeling that this is it. But it still roles down to this decision. 

00:42:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI It does. 

00:42:35
ALLEN IVEY So reality is strengths, part of the reality too is this challenge of making this important decision where we come from a vision, a point of vision and passion and excitement, caring for others and strengths then to work on the challenge. 

00:42:55
Positive reframe 

00:42:55
ALLEN IVEY So this almost sounds to me more like an opportunity than a problem. How you're gonna actualize the opportunity? How is that sound to you? 

00:43:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I think that -- it is an opportunity depending on how I look at it. If I don't view pursuing an education further or into a doctoral program as an absence of the role that I see myself potentially playing in a high school but rather as an opportunity, I think that sounds invigorating. 

00:43:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Another reality concern hits me when I think about you is there a wrong decision you can make between these two? 

00:43:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I mean, I think that there is time, if I were to choose option A, which was what I thought I would be doing, going into a school there it's always the option later to pursue a doctoral program and make sure that the fit is right and that I've got a little experience under my belt as well. If I were to go directly into a doctoral program without that experience, although I have life experience in other fields -- 

00:44:05
ALLEN IVEY But on the other hand, is there operating the coach, you get experience in internship and practicum. 

00:44:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Absolutely, which I'm entering next week and I'm so excited about it. 

00:44:20
ALLEN IVEY So excited about it. So that may be another part of your vision and reality is that we know this at this point, but we may know more at a later point, right? 

00:44:30
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Absolutely. 

00:44:30
ALLEN IVEY Maybe you will finally decide the day. 

00:44:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Right. 

00:44:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And you have the questions. We'll flash the questions up here. And let's take another what four minutes or so and go through and try this out. Look at the reality, story, the strengths. Look at the person's strengths and challenges. Can we come back as a group now and we'll talk again about what we done so far? 

00:44:55
ALLEN IVEY We've only got so much time. 

00:44:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Back to -- back to our group. Sorry to stop and stare at you. Comments, questions. What -- how did this part feel as you came with the -- looking at strengths again. Comments, questions from the group, so we can learn from each other. Yes, go ahead Carol. 

00:45:10
CAROL  I asked my coachee that what were her strengths and I got the answer of the challenge. 

00:45:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You got the answer of the challenge, instead of strengths. What did you do then? 

00:45:20
CAROL Well, I re-asked the question again, you know. 

00:45:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

00:45:25
CAROL In a word of context, explain what I observed, happened and then asked again. 

00:45:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Good. Anybody else here with -- over here Allen. You're doing a very good job. Let's reward him. The microphone is working. 

00:45:40
  We actually, when that question, that question has challenged us to go back and redefine the goal. 

00:45:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Redefine the goal, yeah. Very good. Anybody else? Back to questions, comments. How do you feel when you had, have to give your strengths? How's that feeling when you are talking about your strengths? Who are some of the coaches in here? I want to talk to them. Besides Carol, we've another coach. Yeah, go ahead. How did you feel talking about your strengths? 

00:46:15
  The approach I took was one of making sure that it wasn't too cliche and having the coachee determined -- determine what that strength was. 

00:46:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

00:46:35
 Yeah. So, that's why they, if wasn't so cliche and it was a bit more thoughtful, a little bit more in depths. 

00:46:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Good. Okay, very good. Next, I think we're going to combine the next two together. Some people already looked at the goals again. But let's take a look, we're gonna do goals, a review and then we're gonna look at options and restoring. 

00:47:05
Goals - a Review 

00:47:05
REVIEW AND ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS 

00:47:05
What do you really want? 

00:47:05
What is the ideal person you want to be? Your best 

00:47:05
self? Imagine your ideal self? 

00:47:05
What is the gap between where you are now and 

00:47:05
where you want to be? 

00:47:05
Why does the vision matter to you? 

00:47:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So they do -- someone said that they have to review their goals. And I think that does happen as you start through, you have to sort of go back and review the goals. We have this space as we find that early goals sometimes have to be reconsidered. It's exactly what some of you said. After reality comes in. You know, after talking about the reality and challenges, we have to say, well that's not gonna work. I'm gotta reconsider something else. Note the question they're going to ask here. So here are some, we're gonna review and establish clear goals. You're gonna look again. So the goals at the beginning might not appear as realistic, so now what do you really want? I like that question a lot. You know, what do you really want? And then here is what is ideal person you want to be? Your best self? Imagine your ideal self. These are some very good questions to use. What is the gap between where you are now and where you wanna be? That tells us we're here and we wanna be here. And why does this vision matter to you? That's a Viktor Frankl meaning question. Why does this vision matter to you? So, even though we don't use to make why questions, in some cases, you can probably slip that in and you might get some good results. So let's-- and then let's go on. Should I do the --. 

00:48:15
ALLEN IVEY Your options too. 

00:48:15
O: OPTIONS, Restorying 

00:48:15
Generate multiple possibilities to achieve goals 

00:48:15
What workable strategies can you apply? 

00:48:15
What new comes to you as we talk? 

00:48:15
How confident are you that you can reach this 

00:48:15
vision? 

00:48:15
CC - more advice, information giving, logical 

00:48:15
consequences, positive reframe, elicit and 

00:48:15
reflect meaning, examine consequences 

00:48:15
LISTEN-INFORM-ENCOURAGE-GIVE FEEDBACK 

00:48:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And I do options too. And then the options are -- that's the restorying. Generate multiple possibilities to achieve the goals. What workable strategies can you apply? What new comes to you as we talk? How confident are you that you can reach this vision? And here is counseling coach, you know, more advice. Here is for you, you get more advice, more information giving, logical consequences, little bit different than we do in counseling. We're doing much more of the influencing skills, positive reframe, elicit and reflect meaning and examine consequences. So, those kinds of skills that we take from micro-counseling would be more in the influencing skills. But we use them in counseling coaching. So you listen, inform, encourage and give feedback. That's what we're doing in the restorying. So we have a couple of things we're gonna do. Give you a little bit more time to go through two of those together. And then we'll -- 

00:49:10
ALLEN IVEY Do you wanna see some video? 

00:49:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, yeah. We've gotta see video. I'm sorry, forgot about video. Here is Allen again with Jennifer. 

00:49:15
3. THE GROW MODEL: 

00:49:15
OPTIONS 

00:49:15
ALLEN IVEY  I'll also say from my counseling background, I often thought my best counseling was done, a student will come in with a question and we might resolve that question. But they went out with three more questions, because they saw more possibilities for them. So that there is more possibilities. What are workable strategies? Next is O, options. The restorying part. What are some workable strategies we can apply to reach that vision, that goal, which you have such passion for? 

00:49:50
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I believe what you just mentioned was going into my practicum and internship experience. That's an opportunity to really ground truth my personal theory of what it would be like on the job in a high school. 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY So, it's again number one strategy. What is another strategy that might occur to you to sort of look at this decision. 

00:50:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Uhm, speak to -- speak to my mentors. 

00:50:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah-ha, speak to your mentor. And what about school observation? 

00:50:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI  Going into high school or are you referring to -- 

00:50:25
ALLEN IVEY  I'm talking about, I know that a lot of people can get a lot of shadowing somebody during the day. Have you ever thought about that possibility? 

00:50:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes, yes. I have -- I've had one short shadowing opportunity. And I'll have more going forward after next week. 

00:50:45
ALLEN IVEY So you have several options there then for strategies that will help you make the decision and then it will happen. Now next one's a easier one for you, I think I've got the answer. How confident are you that you're gonna reach this vision. 

00:51:00
Explore degree of confidence 

00:51:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yeah. I feel confident. 

00:51:05
O: OPTIONS, Restorying 

00:51:05
Generate multiple possibilities to achieve goals 

00:51:05
What workable strategies can you apply? 

00:51:05
What new comes to you as we talk? 

00:51:05
How confident are you that you can reach this 

00:51:05
vision? 

00:51:05
CC - more advice, information giving, logical 

00:51:05
consequences, positive reframe, elicit and 

00:51:05
reflect meaning, examine consequences 

00:51:05
LISTEN-INFORM-ENCOURAGE-GIVE FEEDBACK 

00:51:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Those are your questions. Options, restorying. Did you -- did you put the goal, redoing the goal? You can look back at Carol confidence goals if you wanna review the goals before you proceed ahead. You can review the goals, I think they are right here. And then you proceed ahead. 

00:51:20
 I do -- 

00:51:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Is that working. 

00:51:25
 Hello. 

00:51:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No, what you were going to say? Here. 

00:51:30
 What I wanna say is that keep in mind that vision, the ideal person, that you really want to be that micro -- Viktor Frankl vision. 

00:51:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. We're supposed to keep in mind the vision. Who you really want to be, use our vision. Okay, you may start. Okay, I think we're ready to comeback as a group. Okay, ready to comeback. One -- one thing -- what one thing stood out for you as you are looking at options and challenges, what one thing stood out for you as you were doing this section of the -- of the GROW model. Here's someone back here. 

00:52:05
 It just helped me to focus, get your ideas together. 

00:52:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It helps you focus, to get your ideas together. Helps you focus, put things together. Anybody else? What one thing stood out for you? 

00:52:15
  One thing. 

00:52:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Down here. We're taping this. We have to hear -- we have to hear your voices. 

00:52:25
 Sorry, I'm seated at the front for the coach, which I wasn't the coach. I was doing more work and she wasn't having to do it. I was having to come up with my own, what else, you know, what else could I think of and produce the, you know, the things that I knew I could do. 

00:52:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. So, you were doing the work and getting, coming up with answers? Yes. 

00:52:50
 I liked how it kept on coming back to meaning and goal. And that was like a compass that was going back to focus. 

00:53:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Going to meaning and goals and focus was helpful. 

00:53:00
 Yeah. 

00:53:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Good. Anyone else? Let's move on to -- 

00:53:10
ALLEN IVEY I'd like to just add one thing before we move on. I think maybe you can already see that basically many of you might realize you are already doing a lot of coaching. It's a little difference but doesn't take much to get there. And again Margaret Moore's book. I tell you, most of which you already know and put in the different frame of reference. I've often thought that at office, community counseling center might be more acceptable, lot of people, we call that community counseling and coaching center. 

00:53:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I have more people coming to see you. 

00:53:45
ALLEN IVEY And a high school counselor, you can say, you can come to me for counseling or for coaching and to find and make it a little bit different. 

00:53:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Sure we find it change in language isn't might be more open to coming to see you. Okay, last step. We're looking at way forward action plan. 

00:54:00
W: Way Forward=Action 

00:54:00
Summarize action plan 

00:54:00
Are you ready and committed? 

00:54:00
Will you do it tomorrow? 

00:54:00
Contract for homework and follow-up 

00:54:00
SOMETIMES MISSING INCOUNSELING AND 

00:54:00
THERAPY 

00:54:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And here we're going to take a look to summarize an action plan. Are you ready and committed? This is the step that's very important to coaching? Are you gonna do something? Will you do it tomorrow? Contract for homework and follow through. And I don't know if we're gonna see each other tomorrow, but most of you here for the conference tomorrow. So maybe you can check in. Maybe we've even done one little step. Sometimes missing in counseling and therapy as this homework and this follow through. And counselors generally do a lot of follow through and a lot of homework. And so, let's just take a few minutes to wind things up. Oh, we gotta see the tape. Let's see what happened with Jennifer and Allen. How they -- what she decided? 

00:54:45
ALLEN IVEY I don't think, I can explore that any further. I think you answered and we see you smiling. So we got the GRO, we move to W. It's called the way forward and will. Are you ready and committed? 

00:55:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I'm ready. Yes. 

00:55:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. And if we weren't doing, if coaching weren't going so smoothly and quickly, which I'm glad because they want to do the short demo, we really would need to explore that issue of commitment. And what is the nature of the commitment you have at this moment here in now? 

00:55:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Which may actually get at the nature of my dilemma, I feel stronger commitment to my first goal of entering a high school as a school counselor. And I also feel commitment to pursuing an education, although I'm not -- my confidence is not as strong in that area. So I've got stronger commitment to high school and very strong commitment to my education currently. 

00:55:45
ALLEN IVEY I also heard another commitment. That was a commitment to explore and not quite make the final decision until you explore just a little further. Is that right? 

00:55:55
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. I'm completely committed to the process. 

00:56:00
ALLEN IVEY Completely committed to process. Tell me a little bit more about that area where you are not quite so sure you are committed. 

00:56:05
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Uhm, about more than -- I think it gets to the absence of so excited about the idea that this program was gonna take me x amount of time to get through and when I'm through with my program, I get to enter a school and do the things that I've dreamt about doing or put into motion some of the things that are happening in my thought process towards school counseling. 

00:56:30
ALLEN IVEY Interesting. Okay. I'd like to give you a little bit of what we call feedback. And that is that just listening to you, I guess I had a feeling of, almost in my body a feeling of joy that a person -- young person like you is entering our field with that much commitment and passion, I really want to say that I gotta a good sensory of goals, I've got a good sensory of your passion. I've got a good sensory of options. By the way, the coaching model GROW makes sense. You are in the process of GROWing. Okay. Number nine, we're almost done. We kind of make our time too. Will you do it tomorrow? 

00:57:10
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. 

00:57:10
ALLEN IVEY Okay. This is what coaching is little sharper sometimes than counseling. I make a big stress in counseling, generalization, homework. You'll see lot in these tapes. On homework, use this DVD on homework. But will you do it tomorrow, which really critical. What you're gonna do tomorrow to start actualizing this vision, this passion, this goal. 

00:57:35
Coaching asks for immediate action 

00:57:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, I actually have an opportunity that will come up. I've got a meeting with one of mentoring professors tomorrow. So, this is something that we can discuss in our conversation. 

00:57:50
ALLEN IVEY So, you know, start right by talking to your mentor. I'm gonna ask you for some feedback, what one thing might stood up for you today from this short session? 

00:58:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I think, realizing that it doesn't have to happen -- that the decision doesn't have to happen tomorrow that I've gotta process that I can go through, opportunities that are coming right around the corner, starting next week with shadowing and internship next semester. So, realizing that the decision doesn’t have to be immediate and giving myself the time to feel comfortable with all of the different elements. 

00:58:25
ALLEN IVEY  Okay, even though I had the book in the hand, I was looking down and how did that feel for you? 

00:58:30
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Fine. Natural. Yeah. 

00:58:35
DEBRIEFING THE SESSION 

00:58:35
W: Way Forward=Action 

00:58:35
Summarize action plan 

00:58:35
Are you ready and committed? 

00:58:35
Will you do it tomorrow? 

00:58:35
Contract for homework and follow-up 

00:58:35
SOMETIMES MISSING IN COUNSELING AND 

00:58:35
THERAPY 

00:58:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hope some people came up with some good action plans and came up with some clarity. And I think, we should all think of what's next for you? Are you going to do more coaching, is you going to combine this with your counseling? You know, what you're gonna take away? And this -- these are the questions I want you to think about and we'll discuss as a group, just before we go to last five minutes. 

00:59:00
What next 

00:59:00
for 

00:59:00
you? 

00:59:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What is meaningful to you and your practice? What one thing stands out about counseling coaching? What's one thing stands out for you? What do you see as the major strengths and weaknesses? What's it major strengths and weaknesses of counseling coaching. And do you already use coaching? Will this enable you to do more? And what are the advantages and dangers of this approach? Any comments from the group on any one of these questions? Let's sort of wind up our discussion about this. I know we've compressed it in a short time, but I hope you have some general feeling for counseling coaching. Down here, thank you. 

00:59:35
  Thank you. It's just such a relief to know that it doesn't have to be one or the other. It's a combination of both. 

00:59:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What we think it is, I mean some people would say, it's one or the other. We think they blend together. Carol does it too sarcastic. I think they could go right together. I think we do a lot of it. 

00:59:55
 Absolutely, I sort of -- I was really in two minds, just to what should I do. I'm a counselor, psychotherapist. But so much of it involves in supporting and chasing out directions in a positive way and looking at the challenges. And I though, ah, today it's been such a relief to be able to sort of say, okay I can combine the two. Now, it's a matter of by just talking the women here and the group, that it's formulated in my mind that I gotta go on do the coaching side to support and add to the counseling side. 

01:00:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Add to your skills, good. Wonderful, thank you very much for sharing. Anybody else wanna react to any of the questions up here as a way of winding up our time together? Oh, you're also quite, I bet you are waiting for that party tonight, huh? Come on. I'm not gonna leave until we have three questions. Three more -- I've got two more --. 

01:00:55
 I just had a concern. I can see the positive. It's fast and it gets to the point and sees the positive things. I just have a small concern about, does it not -- you know, pick up on people's feelings, you know, if this anxiety or fear, is it just kind of tramming over it? 

01:01:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, you know, one of the thing -- do you want to speak to them -- what you're doing? Here, go up. I think that -- 

01:01:30
ALLEN IVEY If you were to look at this book, you'd say, oh, yeah, they pick up feelings. And obviously we're not doing a lot in 20 minutes. 

01:01:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, you would pick up feelings. And the other thing is to, I think you'll know, which client is best for coaching and which one's best for counseling. And there might be -- there you are, right there, I think it's a continuum right there. 

01:01:50
 You've got your skills intuition already (inaudible ). 

01:01:57
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Wait. We gotta get Carol here. Here Carol. 

01:01:57
  You've got your skills and intuition already, you know that you've earned through doing counseling and that's not gonna going at the door. You are tuned to listening to a client and understanding with the red. And you will know whether this is right or not. And make perfect adjustments. But it's always about being in the service of the client. It's what just the client need. And if it's what the coaching what they need, that's it. And if it's counseling, it's counseling. But having this skills to pick up what's best in the moment. 

01:02:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Good. 

01:02:25
 It's the feeling that the danger is that it might -- it might get practitioners that jump into, let's go, let's do, let's -- and this is the danger of that. 

01:02:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. Well, you know, coaching is an unregulated field right now. So, you know, you do have to be very careful. That's right. 

01:02:45
 My personal view is, I like the GROW model, I call it ROWG. I actually start with Reality. Reality for the client. What is their reality. And I actually bring the Goal bit into the end because once you understood the context, you're in a better position. So, I actually call the GROW model, ROWG. 

01:03:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay, good. And Carol is out there doing it. So. I told Carol, I said that, you can be my assistant coach up here. I think you have to adopt this to see how it works for you, you know, then to see, yeah. 

01:03:10
  Sorry. All the models you can use in counseling, you can use in coaching. You know, it is -- it's eclectic mix of models and methods and things that we talked about in the last session I was in. But you bring all of that into what's best for the client in the moment. 

01:03:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And I think, you can just add this to your skill bag of -- can't you just add this to the things that you can do. 

01:03:35
 Reach for the carpenter you know. 

01:03:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good. Any other comments from the group here. Thank you, one there, okay. 

01:03:45
 But I think that coaching has got some similarities with CBT in a way. 

01:03:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. There is a lot -- there's similarities. Um, I think this focused really much -- 

01:04:05
 But the questions (inaudible ). 

01:04:08
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. More solution focused. Probably more solution focused than CBT. Yeah. 

01:04:15
ALLEN IVEY You can use -- certainly you can use dimensions of CBT and you should, but keep in mind CBT ends with the word Therapy. And coaching is not therapy. But part of the skills of CBT are relevant. 

01:04:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Richard. 

01:04:30
RICHARD Just adding quick words. Adding a little comments in -- for those who were in the workshop before with me and some of the things with Allen in the first as with particularly this aspect of loosing your sense of -- shifting the way your mind works, when your values are externalized. When you are externally evaluated, you lose your sense of personalize with the walking exercise, where I could -- I actually turned in the phase of four minutes. People's motivation and focus on walking from the own volition to my volition, which was just you know, I just get mind-blowing every time I do it. And that the one such thing of coaching is lot of people coming. I feel awful and terrible and emotional, and distressed and upset because I can't manage I can't do, I can't do. And actually all I need to do is with this coaching prices of this beautiful return of the whole thing to this central focus of themselves, it's you who are retiring, it's you who were going into this and what are you going to do. And I'm not you wonderful, and how can I help. It's is quite fascinating. 

01:05:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's nice to be focused on the client. Certainly focus on the client. 

01:05:40
ALLEN IVEY Well, as a victim or a person who's been evolved in the life coaching, I think our coaches after the smashing has helped us an awful a lot. You know, on the other hand like anybody else, she's not perfect. Sometimes she goes on too long with little too much advice. In the other hand, it's kind of like parents. You listen to the advice, but she'll let us choose,(ph) and there's an interesting word that goes with coaching and it's championing. Championing the client's success, which is a nice word. 

01:06:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Just feels like she is on our side, we're working together with ten grandchildren and a crazy life. You know we've got a champion there working for us. And you folks have been absolutely terrific. I wanna thank Allen for his part. 

01:06:30
