00:00:55
INSIDE OUT 

00:00:55
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:00:55
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal. And then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This show brings together the leading strategist in the area of brief therapy. Each one will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

BOLSTERING SELF-ESTEEM & ALLAYING SELF-CRITICISM; ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY 

00:01:40
STEPHEN LANKTON THERAPIST 

00:01:50
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. 

00:01:50
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest Stephen Lankton. And he's going to talk to us today about Ericksonian therapy, um, a form of brief therapy. Steve just what does brief therapy mean to you? 

00:02:00
Stephen Lankton, M.S.W. ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY 

00:02:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, for me brief therapy is uh, a 1 to 10 session meeting with the client. Recognizing the changes uh, cynical or not uh, continuous in the person's life. So, the major components are to uh, to, to leverage the, the talents and resources the person has to propel them into that kind of change they wish to accomplish at this next moment into the next few weeks. And then we let them continue on with those successes uh, uh, behind them so that they, they increase their own sense of antinomy and they don't have a reliance on the therapist. Um, they don't walk away with uh, uh, a thick bunch of jargon about their life but rather they're going with a sense of, in fact, a sense of maybe I could of done this without going to therapy. 

00:02:50
JON CARLSON What can you tell us about your approach specifically? Just how does it work? 

00:02:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Um, uh, the major aspect of, of, of the approach I think it falls into one area specifically and that's retrieving experiential resources or if you want to leave off the word experiential, retrieving the resources, retrieving your own experiences that uh, you need to have to effectively meet the challenges of your developmental stage or immediate environment. So, for example, if I am unable to, to uh, go publicly because of anxiety. I can't uh, uh, go to a pie place because of uh, the lack of confidence. I can't urinate in the bathroom because of embarrassment or whatever. You're, you're comment is that I can't get the resources I need to have uh, into the foreground to perform and behave and think of myself and perceive my environment in a way that's creative and useful for myself. So, so, brief therapy and the approach itself whether it's brief or not has to do with helping the person uh, learn to have those resources available as automatically as possible. 

00:04:00
JON CARLSON So this is sort of solution focus. In that the solution is within and it's the therapist job to bring that. 

00:04:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Absolutely. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON Solution out. 

00:04:10
STEPHEN LANKTON That's right, going into a solution focus group. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON Are there steps or stages or a process that you use in this approach? 

00:04:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, I look at it as uh, as uh, five, six, seven stage. It just depends on how I break these things down. Probably the first one that goes uh, without saying sometimes in therapy aught to be said, and that's the, that's the therapist uh, attitude or orientation towards uh, uh, a human being and them self, and the problems and how a change occurs. 

00:04:35
JON CARLSON So orientation or the attitude toward the person that they're working with. 

00:04:40
STEPHEN LANKTON I think um, continually, we all should continually learning that uh, new world view actually. Because it's something that we, we've, the opposite of which we've been ingrained with all our life and all of our scientific thinking. Once and as you take that step then you're, then you're making distinctions about the client. Rather than what normal psychology seems to do historically which is lump people into one of 15 or 25 different categories. I want to lump uh, 6 billion people into 6 billion categories. I want to, I want to find out what is different about everybody and how those differences can uh, enhance uh, their ability to change quickly with my help, if necessary. Uh, so those, making those distinctions; what's the inner personal style, how does uh, distinctions apply to losing them self in the environment. And then there's the uh, uh, assessment of their, of their situation. Their development stages, their, their current family structure and so on. Uh, and their symptoms and how that plays out. Uh, and then the, the resources that they have available and how flexible they are in and how much energy is needed for them to get to those resources when they need them. Uh, then as you determine goals that will help make those contracts get actualized with the client, you have another stage. Realistic goals for the session or sessions. 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON And these are goals that are really going to help the client and fulfill their needs? 

00:06:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, they're the practical goals. Maybe you want to be a happy mother. But what's the really mean in terms of therapy session. Well, that means you have to be able to look someone in the eyes, you have to be comfortable in their presence, you have to be sexual, you to have to etc. And then uh, then choosing interventions that will help you get to those uh, uh, perturb the system and then and, and move the client in ways that haven't moved before. So some of those are probes and you to try to uh, intervention you find that it's helpful. You continue to use it. You find that it's not as helpful, you use something else and you switch to a different set of interventions or a different way of approaching it. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON Uh, go ahead. 

00:06:35
STEPHEN LANKTON And finally keep observing the whole time. I think that's the last uh, the last your first, at all times one of the uh, method pieces of methodology that you want to find out that at all times that this process is going to uh, in separate stages these things are in holding simultaneously. You're always assessing, you're always observing, you're always holding that attitude, and so on. 

00:07:00
JON CARLSON And isn't that what Milton Erickson was a master of, of observation. Didn't I hear a story of that, that's, didn't he have polio and he just observed for many years. 

00:07:05
STEPHEN LANKTON He was incredible with the suddlety of the observations that he would make. And if you try to play a joke on him, and uh, change something in his office. One time people, uh, we, there was a little owl that was turned sideways. And uh, we'd always play, not always but we'd often play little tricks to see. And one point at the end of this particular session when people were filing out, Erikson hadn't commented on this little bitty figurine that had been uh, changed in the dark corner of the office. As everyone was starting to move out the door, we had to move behind his wheelchair to get out the door. And he stopped everybody and he said, "Oh, and that other thing you want me to comment about, I don't give a hoot about." 

00:07:40
Stephen Lankton, M.S.W. ERICKSONIAN 

00:07:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And so, they, it was, it was, he would, he could recognize, he showed us times when he recognized. Uh, he had us all meet uh, a person who, who, who shook hands with him. And the he asked the fellows occupation. And uh, none of us had a clue uh, that he he had known from the way the fellow gripped his hand, and the Clausius on the man's hand uh, what his occupation was. 

00:08:05
DIANE KJOS So, you, you studied with Erickson and how did you get involved in that? How did you go there and what was your interest in Ericksonian? 

00:08:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. Well um, I had been gradually moving towards therapies that had of less and less of uh, uh, derogatory elements for the human structure as it were in it. So, I moved to uh, from uh, you know, away from the classical psychoanalytical analytic psychotherapy sort of things towards those uh, gestalt and transactional analysis. Those modern interpersonal therapies that had less to do with the negative aspect of the human quality. And, and actually Erickson uh, embodied that more than, than anyone else I ever meet. There was simply, that wasn't present. It was everything that the person is doing is a way of solving problems to get their experiences on line to be used as their call for in the world. And if you happen to be using it incorrectly in the moment then you're not making the best use of it. But uh, he felt, I think he wrote somewhere I can't find the quote I looked for it once. But, in the most disturbed person he figured that the, that there was 99% of the neurological pathways had to do with health. And uh, he, he really took the, the, he would ask us uh, have you caught our clients doing anything recently? And if you didn't realize it and said, yeah you caught your client doing something wrong the other day. You had flubbed up. He wanted to know if you caught your client doing something healthy today. 

00:09:35
DIANE KJOS Healthy, yeah, yeah. 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON In this approach can you kind of uh, talk about how change occurs. It almost seems like you're looking backwards. I mean you're starting with a person as. 

00:09:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Milton actually told a story once, about three days on, on inter-, on interpersonal development when a couple of us asked him. Uh, one little four minute segment of this thing was about his son going for his first date. And uh, he said that uh, he went to the malt shop and uh, had uh, malted milk, and mucus membrane stimulation and then they went to the dance for rhythmical physical activity and touching. And then back to the malt shop for hamburger and uh, for more mucus membrane stimulation. When the son got home he had told me he had gone to the malt shop and the dance. And he shook his head and he said,"But I know what you really been doing. He'd been looking at that girl and having rhythmical physical activity and mucus membrane stimulation." And so, we get from this a view of the human being that on the one hand your conscious mind is going through the world on agreed upon uh, reality. But on the other hand you're, you're putting together experiences and associated them and linking them and building increasingly complex uh, gestalt of your perception and experience to use yourself effectively. And that's what change is about. It's helping the person uh, perhaps suspend temporarily their, their mind set and their world view with hypnosis and metaphor and direction uh, assignment so that they can uh, find new experiences available to themselves. Not new to them necessarily but maybe but novel at least in the sense that they haven't been using them before. 

00:11:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah, you talked about um, about, we talked about solution focus and then you talked about the story. And I noticed that you use stories in, in your um, work and, and Erickson certainly did. Um, how, how would you compare this to other brief therapies in terms of. 

00:11:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Well not the techniques themselves don't particularly make the difference. I think the approach makes the difference. We try to say this in all of our writings that, that uh, Erickson's values are not in a bag of tricks but rather an approach to problem solving. A lot of therapies take the uh, uh, that I assess you and I find a label for you and now I know what you are. And that's the truth. And then I give you Valium or I give you an intervention or I give you an assignment. And um, if it doesn't work then maybe you're resistant or something. But uh, that, that angle of the approach is, is simply not there. There is an ongoing responsibility to the therapist in the uh, in the system with the person that the labels that you might use for convenience aren't the truth. They're just labels being used. And so if you don't find any value in the label manic depressive then it's not one that you should pass through your lips when you're uh, speaking to yourself or to the client. So, I think that's one of the major uh, differences and it's certainly an active therapy. Um, there's a good deal of ambiguity which uh, I think uh, uh, distinguishes it in some cases for other therapies because the, rather than saying I want you to do this, I need you to do this. Ambiguity says, here's what people could do and then it's like uh, leading a horse to water and finding out if they're thirsty before you make them drink. And uh, you continue to do that skillfully. 

00:12:55
DIANE KJOS So it's opening up that possibility. 

00:13:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Absolutely, uh-huh. 

00:13:00
JON CARLSON Does it work? I mean is there some research base or support for this approach? 

00:13:05
STEPHEN LANKTON It's hard to, it's hard to take such a complex thing and ask uh, uh, a question like that. Unless, you, you can find out whether Steve Lankton works. You can find out whether another therapist works. But it's hard to say is the approach being replicated by each person that you might want to uh, look at longitudinally. There's certainly a lot of anecdotal studies of cases that seem to be followed up upon. And there's a lot of research on hypnosis which is another distinguishing feature of the, of the Erickson's approach often. Uh, a lot of research on hypnosis, it's not uh, it's not the Erickson's hypnosis is different from anyone else's hypnosis. 

00:13:40
Stephen Lankton, M.S.W. ERICKSON HYPNOTHERAPY 

00:13:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Hypnosis is hypnosis. But if problem solving approach that's a little hard to research. A lot of research on hypnosis or anxiety, depression, sexual problems, uh, and uh, use of fantasy, use of indirect, indirect suggestion, and so on. Showing those things quite uh, effective. The uh, the actual problem solving approach itself, a little tougher to get your arms around to just do research on. 

00:14:05
DIANE KJOS We're going to watch you work with a women who uh, so really looking for personal growth, she said. What kinds of things were you thinking about before you began this interview and what were you looking for there. 

00:14:15
STEPHEN LANKTON The one thing I always uh, think of uh, that I guess I got from uh, reading Erick during long ago was uh, how can I help make this the very last session that this client has to have. 

00:14:30
DIANE KJOS Ah. 

00:14:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And uh, I want uh, I want have nothing on my mind other than that. I don't even want that on my mind. I want to uh, uh, be open to how that person is using themselves and then um, let uh, sort of the stop form on my mind and say, okay if I use myself that way am I going to accomplish what this person's asking for. Or if the person's asking for something that seems out of line uh, then that would be another question. So, so, I want to walk into the session with uh, figuring how to make this the last possibly session. And how would I be stuck if I, if I do what this client does. Could I understand how to be stuck and if so could I understand how I could unstick myself. And that works a great deal of the time. It doesn't work for the times when the persons behaviors is so much over the line and over the top of uh, acceptable to me. Uh, the certain murderers or whatever, I don't think I could work uh, effectively uh, this way because I don't want to stretch to figure out how they're stuck often. 

00:15:35
DIANE KJOS With somebody it just doesn't work with. 

00:15:35
STEPHEN LANKTON It doesn't work with people. I, I think the approach is especially useful for hypnosis. And the approach is not uh, is not useful for a couple of classes of, of uh, potential clients. Uh, folks who are already hugely disorganized to begin with. They're actively psychotic, it's not the way to go. Ambiguity is not what they need. Uh, now that doesn't mean you have to use ambiguity to use Erickson's approach. But the way I work off the use is that if you can't trust the person to, to use the information in a useful way. You shouldn't be giving ambiguous information out. So there certain kind of manipulative characters that uh, this would not also be my number one choice. And I often, often work with children with families but not children alone because it's the, it's the system of the influence, the, the way the family's framing it ties into the kids as it where. That really needs to be changed, the process. 

00:16:25
JON CARLSON You described that when you trained with Dr. Erickson, one of the things he had you do is to read the last page of a chapter, the last page of a book. And anticipate what had gone on before and so as we watch this, I'm going to watch you looking at this last page over the client and channel. 

00:16:45
STEPHEN LANKTON That's all you get with the client is the last page and, and uh, his little instructions to think, well what could of possibly happened that got you to, that got this author to this last page. Then read the last chapter. What could of happened in the book to get this last chapter. Very useful uh, way of, of positing yourself in front of the client and their problem. Thinking okay, what resources then could we have used to write this story differently. 

00:17:10
DIANE KJOS That's logic, yeah. 

00:17:10
JON CARLSON Yes. 

00:17:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay. Hi, Michelle. My name is Steve Lankton and I'm uh, in town from Florida to uh, produce these uh, videotapes. And uh, I don't know much about you now, just simply know that uh, your name's Michelle. So, if you could fill me in on your age and uh, what you do. 

00:17:30
MICHELLE 29. 

00:17:30
STEPHEN LANKTON 29. 

00:17:30
MICHELLE I'm uh, Title Office Clerk, for a title company, close real estate transactions. I've been doing it for about two-and-a-half months. I'm a mom. 

00:17:45
STEPHEN LANKTON How old is your? 

00:17:45
MICHELLE He's nine. 

00:17:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Boy? 

00:17:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Son? 

00:17:50
MICHELLE Yeah. One son. He's 9-years old. 

00:17:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, are you married or divorced? 

00:17:50
MICHELLE Niether. 

00:17:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Neither. Do you have, you're a single parent just the whole time. 

00:17:55
MICHELLE Right. 

00:17:55
STEPHEN LANKTON And uh, so you were pregnant when you where 20. 

00:18:00
MICHELLE Yes, I was.I had him when I was 20. 

00:18:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And have you done, you were working prior to that for a few years? 

00:18:05
MICHELLE Uh, yeah. I worked in um, I was, was actually still in the same industry, in banking, finance in one point or another most of the time. Almost all my life, so. Before that I worked at a bank during the time I was pregnant when I had him. 

00:18:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, you're doing a lot. I, I um, was there school in there some place along the way? 

00:18:25
MICHELLE I had a little bit on and off. Um, general classes at first and then I did, started doing a lot of banking classes, so. Most of what I have is banking related which is probably not what I want to do anymore,so. It's a little unfortunate. 

00:18:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And then you, you contacted uh, the therapy folks because you interested in something about your son? 

00:18:50
MICHELLE Uh, well initially yes. He was uh, um, a little, he was seemingly depressed. And I was concerned that, that had something to do with my changing jobs and new job I was working a lot more hours. And it was just you know, the sudden change that I thought that perhaps that it was my fault that he was so seemingly depressed. And as it turned out um, it was something at school that we had resolved. He had some kids picking on him at school. And he's very um, he's very, very sensitive. Kind of trying to get him to come out of his shell and he a little bit more aggressive. For a 9-year old boy he's very, very sensitive. 

00:19:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Mm-hmm. When I hear you say that I was thinking more about you, about your own continuous. But you decided to continue just for some kind of uh, more gray. 

00:19:45
MICHELLE Personal growth, experience. 

00:19:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh. What did you have in mind? 

00:19:45
MICHELLE I have no, I'm signing up for every personal growth experience I can. I'm going to be 30 this year, so, you know. Trying not cramming it all at once, but kind of maybe catch up with some of the things (crosstalk) maybe thought about. 

00:20:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, how will we know you have grown? What's your? 

00:20:00
MICHELLE When I've grown? 

00:20:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, how will you know when you've grown? What kind of personal growth are you going for here? 

00:20:05
MICHELLE I don't know, I don't know. I just, you know, I think there are a lot of things that I want to do by the time I was 30, and I haven't done a lot of them. There are a lot of things that I used to be interested in or maybe just went kind of pass by. 

00:20:20
STEPHEN LANKTON There are a lot of changes at foot here. You've changed jobs, you're you know you get this. 

00:20:25
MICHELLE I'm doing that again real soon. 

00:20:25
STEPHEN LANKTON You're like coming out of something, or coming out of some kind of other kind of mood that's now changing? 

00:20:30
MICHELLE No, not really. Just kind of uh, just more of a personal awareness that, you know, there's only, you know, so much time. You're only here for so long. I mean you never know how long it's going to be obviously. 

00:20:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. Your parents still alive? 

00:20:50
MICHELLE Yes. 

00:20:50
STEPHEN LANKTON So it could be quite a while. 

00:20:50
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:20:55
STEPHEN LANKTON So it's certainly there's a lot of things to do. I had you score a checklist for uh, the session and um, it might be of interest to show you the results of that. Because uh, your a little vague in this direction you're going. 

00:21:10
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:21:10
STEPHEN LANKTON This actually may uh, give us uh, a variance. At some point it makes some sense. That, this is the raw score of your answers. It's not actually intended to be used this way. It's intended to be used with a standard score that will reduce you to one point on this graph. Which is a graph of dominance and submission, and affiliation and disaffiliation. But the uh, the one point seems to reduce everybody to um, this little glob of similarities. If I leave it this way with the raw score and I see everyone with a range of differences. And I've done it for about, oh, 20 years now, this way. So, I've come to make some good sense of it. What if, if we look at this just uh, as uh, as uh, shape of a graph uh, in this circle here. It appears you have a lot of talents and resources all over the place. You can affiliate and be friendly as you do it. You can compete. Uh, D has to do with sort of aggression and, and moving away from people with anger. Uh, K is uh, sort of a dependency. We ask people for help if you need it. Uh, so is J. 

00:22:20
MICHELLE Oh. 

00:22:20
STEPHEN LANKTON And these have to do uh, those two there, F and G have to do with a uh, kind of provoking a rejection actually. Where you. 

00:22:25
MICHELLE A what? 

00:22:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Provoking rejection. Where you get a little rebellious and say, okay fine make me or whatever. 

00:22:35
MICHELLE Oh, really. 

00:22:35
STEPHEN LANKTON I don't know what that is. And then H is a self criticism score. Um, probably with all the things uh, on the graph there's nothing really wrong with any graph. It depends on how you use yourself in the world, how the world needs you to use yourself. If your world needs you to be like this you got it and you're perfect. It, it does strike me that somethings are high and their partners are low. Like you J is low and your K is high. Your J is a dependency score, too. It's like avoiding dependency. If you have to have needs you show them as long as you're friendly. But you don't want people to find you dependent. Your self criticism is the same way. You criticize yourself but not so that you get too dependent. 

00:23:20
MICHELLE That I'm, I'm very, very self-critical. 

00:23:25
STEPHEN LANKTON You uh, criticize yourself as you move away. As oppose to, in the Woody Allen style where you criticize yourself and stay there. Criticize me. And then uh, it doesn't look like you really want to be disaffiliated. It looks like you want to be friendly. And when you. 

00:23:40
MICHELLE Oh, I am. I do, but I don't um, when I decide that there's um, like you said, moving away from my anger. I, I won't, I won't. That's just not something that I think is worth, you know, somebody else is capable of being friendly that's, then let's be friends. But if not then I'm not running around begging. 

00:24:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, that's a good talent. To be able to say no. That's for sure. Um, you're, it's funny that A be low unless you're just so self-critical that you don't give yourself credit for the managerial skills you've got. 

00:24:15
MICHELLE No, I don't. 

00:24:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Why are you so self-critical? 

00:24:20
MICHELLE I don't know. I have no idea. 

00:24:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Self-growth would be a good place to get rid of self-critical. 

00:24:20
MICHELLE And I'm working on that I, I think, I'm working on that. 

00:24:25
STEPHEN LANKTON When you're talking about your son, you maybe uh, how did you put it. You thought that it might be your fault because you're changing jobs. 

00:24:35
MICHELLE It just, timing seemed very. 

00:24:35
STEPHEN LANKTON You're a. 

00:24:35
MICHELLE Coincidental. 

00:24:40
STEPHEN LANKTON You're a little anxious because, sitting her probably, but there's another emotion on your face, like uh, uh, when you've done something wrong or something. And you just look like you were. 

00:24:50
MICHELLE Guilty. 

00:24:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Crushed or something. 

00:24:55
MICHELLE Oh, it broke my heart. 

00:24:55
STEPHEN LANKTON I'm just asking. 

00:24:55
MICHELLE He would, he would cry for, he would wake up in the morning and cry and beg me to not go to school. And finally, I started sending him to school. I, I got wormed into it for a little while but then I had to send him back. And that, that was really hard to do. 

00:25:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, you've been kind of uh, uh, especially vulnerable to somebody saying you did something wrong if you're already criticizing yourself. 

00:25:20
MICHELLE Oh, yeah, sure. I, I was and I really, I was, I was working a lot, a lot of hours, we spent very little time together. He was constantly either with a babysitter or with my mother or, not that there's anything wrong with either of those two but it wasn't me. And that's, that's part of my job as his mother. Is to be there for him. And I didn't know about a lot of the things that were going on. He didn't confide them in me. He confided them in my mother or his father or my brother. He just, I was getting it from all sides. I had no clue what was going on. Absolutely no idea. 

00:25:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, so you kind of are silently suffering some of these things, aye. Without, people aren't really, you're not really, you have a social network you could? 

00:26:05
MICHELLE I do. And I, I. 

00:26:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Who support you? 

00:26:10
MICHELLE I have an incredible family. My family is wonderful. They're, they're absolutely fantastic. So, I, so, I have, you know, people to bounce these things off of. But they were I think were getting it first hand more, kind of bouncing it off of me. And I had, you know, and it was really the first time I had heard about it. And you know, as far as my incredible family goes, my mother is obviously the leader and you know, when it comes to her grandson. Not that um, not that I'm always wrong but she's always right. So we take that. 

00:26:45
STEPHEN LANKTON This is your mother? 

00:26:45
MICHELLE Yes. So we take that in stride. 

00:26:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, well, that brings me to I, this uh, score go over here. You looked in uh, how would a girl develop this sense of uh, of uh, submission and uh, moving away from people. It would have to be somebody who was hostile and dominant in your family of origin. 

00:27:05
MICHELLE Pretty much. Um. 

00:27:05
STEPHEN LANKTON That would be where the criticism would come from and also 

00:27:10
MICHELLE No, I think it's just come over uh, you know, a period of my life where, not even just a period but of I think I used to always be more the, the, this side. And I, I still am. The wanting to be friendly and wanting to have friends and you know, the wanting people, wanting people to like you. And then finding that they're just some people that aren't worth having as friends. And there's a lot, there's a lot of hostility out there in the world. And in the places that I've worked, people that I've dealt with and it's, it's not worth the energy to put out, to maintain, maybe not necessarily friendships. But different relationships, work relationships or just acquaintances I don't think it's worth the energy, to me to put out to, you know. 

00:28:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, you said a mouthful. 

00:28:00
MICHELLE Sorry. 

00:28:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, so um, where does that leave us. I, I, if we look at this from the big picture you're um, taken a lot of steps almost pro-actively to change your uh, life before you have a problem you need to change. That was pretty good. 

00:28:20
MICHELLE So to speak but I, and then I not necessarily and I don't, and I can't point myself as somebody who has a problem but, but to somebody that could use some change. Not because there's a problem or to work. 

00:28:35
STEPHEN LANKTON How do you know you need change? What's uh, what's one of the clues to you in your lifestyle of ideas? 

00:28:40
MICHELLE Well, I, I just, I've um, one of the clues to my life, in my lifestyle um, my son and I share an apartment with my roommate and her son. Which neither one of us, well my son and I, is what I mean by neither one of us, really um, are going to be happy for you know, over a long period of time. That's something that I need to change. I'm in a job that I'm not really happy with. And in an industry that I really pretty much run the gambit on. And um, there's a lot of things that I wanted to do that I've just kind of let, not let life pass me by but just kind of let it, let it go, let things go by the wayside. And not ever really focus on any of the other things that I always, that I always wanted to do. 

00:29:35
STEPHEN LANKTON There's this kind of sadness when you talk, you know. Is this endemic or something you're sad about. 

00:29:40
MICHELLE No, I don't think there's anything I'm sad about. I'm actually kind of, I'm, I'm actually kind of excited about it. 

00:29:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh, when you talk you get this uh, uh, gosh what is it, kind of uh, it's not just the dryness in your, in your mouth that makes it sound anxious, it's more of uh, color change or something in your cheeks it makes it sort of like you're, uh. 

00:30:05
MICHELLE Really? 

00:30:05
STEPHEN LANKTON What are the things that you haven't done that you? 

00:30:05
MICHELLE Um, there's things that I would like to do. 

00:30:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. 

00:30:10
MICHELLE I'm um, I'm actually going to um, I'm going to take a test to be a police officer. Which I never thought I'd ever do. It's always you know, I think little girls growing up with watching Angie Dickinson, you know. Just always an idea. But um, I just decided that it was something that, you know, I was going. At least, um, and again, I'm being self-critical and not going into it with any real high expectations but I'm going into it with the idea that I'm going to give it the best shot that I can. Um. 

00:30:50
STEPHEN LANKTON It will, tell me more about this self-critical thing, Michelle. I have two more ideas and I want to make sure that's not one of them before I abandon it. 

00:30:55
MICHELLE What's that? 

00:30:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Abandon it. Uh, how long have you been so critical of yourself? 

00:31:00
MICHELLE Always. 

00:31:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Like as a child or? 

00:31:05
MICHELLE Uh. 

00:31:05
STEPHEN LANKTON As a teenager? 

00:31:05
MICHELLE Yeah, kind of not good enough kind of complex. 

00:31:10
STEPHEN LANKTON It would be real nice to get rid of that. 

00:31:10
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:31:10
STEPHEN LANKTON I uh, there's a lot of it going around. And I don't want to be too redundant in what I, what I do here today but this, uh. 

00:31:25
MICHELLE So, I'm not the first one. 

00:31:25
STEPHEN LANKTON You're not the first person to feel that way. Well, take me back. What's the earliest time you fell, uh, you remember this feelings way. 

00:31:35
MICHELLE Mmm. I just, I remember um, when I, when I was younger probably my son's age maybe a little bit younger, I used to get picked on a lot like he is now. Um, I was small. I was very, very small. I was very tiny, very petite, very frail. So it was real easy even, you know. 

00:32:05
STEPHEN LANKTON This is uh, third or fourth grade? 

00:32:10
MICHELLE Um, yeah. Third and fourth, second, third grade. Second and third grade. And I never. 

00:32:15
STEPHEN LANKTON So you seen it as though peers not really making you feel welcomed. 

00:32:20
MICHELLE Yeah. So I grow into this I want everybody to like me kind of person. And wanting all of these friends but then I get this other side of it, that I'm actually okay, without half of them. Um, but yeah, I think kind of, I, I would have to say if I had, I had to pinpoint anything that would probably be it. 

00:32:45
STEPHEN LANKTON You didn't, and you went home and said, hey I'm getting picked on and. 

00:32:50
MICHELLE No, I didn't, I never said anything. 

00:32:50
STEPHEN LANKTON So you kept it to yourself. Why? 

00:32:55
MICHELLE I didn't, I don't know. I wish I did because then I'd know why my son didn't tell me. And I, and I, and I've actually tried to figure that out for, you know, for a little while anyway. Just so I could get a little more insight as to why he didn't say anything to me. I really don't know why I never said anything. 

00:33:15
STEPHEN LANKTON So when you feel out of it now, do you still keep it to yourself? 

00:33:25
MICHELLE Um, no not entirely. I vent. I have my roommate, I have my mother, I vent. I go off on little tangents and then I feel better. 

00:33:35
STEPHEN LANKTON All right, so, kids are rejecting you how does translate into self-criticism? And kids are picking on you? Do you internalize it? You say maybe they're right. Is something wrong with me? 

00:33:45
MICHELLE No. Yeah, I was just really thought that there was something wrong with me that um, I wasn't tall enough. Excuse me. I wasn't old enough. When I uh, I started, I was one of those kids that started school at like just got in by the cut-off, so. 

00:34:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Well let's talk about something you've done right, for just a second. 

00:34:00
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:34:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Um, one of the guys I uh, uh, studied with a lot uh, has a pretty interesting story of uh, of a guy who uh, succeeded at this um, barn dance. He looked in this old, old, old story. 

00:34:15
MICHELLE Barn dance? Okay. 

00:34:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Barn dance when they had those kind of things. 

00:34:20
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:34:20
STEPHEN LANKTON And uh, it comes to mind. Uh, as you're changing these things in your life. Uh, if you uh, could you, what's the most powerful experience you ever had in the stuff you've done really, just incredibly well? You don't have to tell me, but. Can you remember it for a second and then when you're there uh. 

00:34:40
MICHELLE No, the only thing that I can, the first thing that always comes to my mind is my son. Aside from that he's sensitive and he gets picked on, he's a great, great kid. He's an incredible person. 

00:34:50
STEPHEN LANKTON So you've given a relationship quality that you're proud of. 

00:34:55
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. 

00:34:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh. The way this scenario went was uh, uh, and the way I see it going with, with, if we can do hypnosis successfully in 25 minutes here and get you to, uh. Hypnosis is a state of heightened concentration where you, where you turn your awareness on internal experiences. If that internal experience you can get a hold of and magnify that then why can't we take that and have you project that into these future things that you haven't done and you want to do. Uh, sort of like uh, uh, a pre- uh, coding all of those future experiences with this confidence that you gain from the relationship with him. And, and uh, then those aren't events that you're going to, going to sort of uh, hap haphazardly hoping that you hit upon a good feeling of confidence as you go. Your brains already going to have put one in that neuro situation. I don't really know what those are, what those things are that you haven't done yet but you do. I don't think, I need to know really. 

00:36:00
MICHELLE Ah, I think the, the test was, was probably. 

00:36:05
STEPHEN LANKTON That police thing. 

00:36:05
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:36:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Police Academy and your graduation, that's a huge part of it. 

00:36:10
MICHELLE A lot of um, some, some things that I've just been afraid of for all my life. 

00:36:15
STEPHEN LANKTON You want to just name a couple for me. 

00:36:15
MICHELLE Heights. Last year, I uh, uh, I've always been uh, terribly afraid of heights, I have an incredible phobia of heights, falling, or drowning. I don't know anybody, you know, that's not afraid of drowning. Um, but those were always things that I. 

00:36:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Jacques Crusteo, I could say. So have you been in trance before? 

00:36:30
MICHELLE Pardon me? 

00:36:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Have you been in trance before? 

00:36:35
MICHELLE No. 

00:36:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Um, you're going to want to do this on your own if you're doing this personal growth uh, gig for the next uh, couple of years. 

00:36:40
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:36:40
STEPHEN LANKTON There's uh, let me show you, let me show you to, one way at least. 

00:36:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:36:45
STEPHEN LANKTON There are two leads on this that are useful and I think you'll probably uh, find this one pretty easy because you're able to visualize so well. Um, I sometimes draw this, so I'll draw with my hands here. This is uh, a way, I want, I want you just to use your imagination to help shift your experiences to your feelings. And uh, so I want you to picture like, this is your uh, body and head here. Picture a funnel with your head being held up at the top of the funnel the troft of the funnel going down to the spine to where your butt meets the chair. 

00:37:20
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:37:20
STEPHEN LANKTON And then, so close your eyes and do that picture that kind of, uh, imagination and if not visually loosely hold up your head and troft down your spine. 

00:37:35
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:37:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, next step is imagine that you begin to uh, travel down that tube and as you do it kind of a third step, let your eyes gradually gently roll upward a bit so that you can imagine seeing the hole of the funnel getting further above your head. 

00:37:50
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:37:50
STEPHEN LANKTON So, imagination heightens your sense of dropping down to your center of gravity. 

00:37:55
MICHELLE I'm going to fall. 

00:37:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. And then you'll fall for just a second and you'll hit the chair where your butt meets the chair with relaxation. And then when you do, I should see the movement shift, so I'll know you made it. 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:10
STEPHEN LANKTON And now when you got to that relaxation you should be there by now, it's a short step. And I'm going to ask you to hold to that don't move your awareness out of that spot for a couple of minutes because it takes two or three minutes for your awareness to gel on that relaxation. So, while you're doing that, I'm going to count from 10 to 1 backwards. So that we can limit, and then afterwards I'm going to show you the other one. 10, and let the relaxation spread up your hips and down towards your knees, 9, 8, and up over your waist up close to your chest, 7, and down to your knees and your thighs, 6, 5, and up your shoulders and beginning to be on top of your arms, 4, and down your ankles and your feet, 3, and the rest way down your eyes, and you're going to feel up your neck and your jaw, up around the back of your head, 2, and then around the front of your face, 1. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, I'll count forward even though you might can switch your eyes open real quick anyway. But uh, two, three, four, five, six. You're pretty relaxed. You really look absorbed pretty quickly in that. Now this other way is a slightly more um, feeling oriented way, sort of visual oriented way. And see which one works best for you. Put your hands about uh, half inch apart and then not touching anything as you do this one. And holding for just a second your eyes opened, focusing on your fingers. And as you relax you're probably feel a little tingle or uh, uh, pulsation, um, some kind of, almost feels magnetic to some people. You probably should leave your legs uncrossed too because something's going to get real heavy if we succeed. And as you relax and start to feel the little tingling let me know. In your fingertips. As you relax your hands you should feel sort of pulsing or tingling, do you feel that. 

00:40:35
MICHELLE Neither one of them. 

00:40:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Sure, close your eyes as you as you hear me, maybe that will help. Can you feel more than one of them yet? 

00:40:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:40:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, this is a suddle feeling, so I want you to hold on to it and do this with your eyes closed. Move your awareness from the spot where you feel it, about a half inch up towards your palm, and just and all the fingers and just wait there until you feel the feeling kind of catch up with that. 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:05
STEPHEN LANKTON And then move your awareness another half-inch up towards your palm, hold it there and wait for a second and then the feeling will catch up with that. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And I'm going to be shining a flashlight in front of it. Puppy here something that keeps following your unconscious experience, so just keep following it. Does that, hands working out for you? 

00:41:40
MICHELLE Uh, I'm sorry. 

00:41:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay, it's working. Did that? Is it working? Do you feel uh, the feeling catching up with your awareness? 

00:41:45
MICHELLE In, in some spots. 

00:41:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, you don't need to feel it everywhere. 

00:41:45
MICHELLE Okay. 

00:41:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, that seemed to be working as it was absorbing your awareness away from what I was saying even so. 

00:41:55
MICHELLE A little bit, okay. 

00:41:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Go ahead and do that some more. And either way it should work fine. But let's do the one that works the most profoundly and rapidly. See if you can catch back up with where you were with that uh, feeling. And I'll count backwards and also keep giving you some direction about it. If you tune me out don't worry about it, your unconscious listening still uh, keep you on target. So, moving your awareness another half inch and then or a quarter inch and then waiting for that pulsation catching up. And if it's only one or two fingers that's enough, that's all you need. As your conscious mind focuses on the next spot, you wait. Your conscious will catch up with that also. What you're actually feeling is your uh, uh, probably your capillary pressure in your finger. So it's, it's a normal feeling, just don't normally have your awareness, just tune that carefully. And then move it up towards the knuckle of your palm, fingers, and palm knuckles. And wait until it catches up to your fingers. 19, 18, 17, 16. And then feel the back of your palms become flooded with that feeling. 15, 14, 13, and let it more around towards your thumbs. And you might I imagine you can because some people can have a sensation of sort of stepping inside that little circle of your fingers and thumb uh, as if that part of your thumb and hand was replaced by your shoulders and neck and you feel the pulsation fairly uh, rapidly uh, swoosh over your upper torso 15, 14, 13, 12. Otherwise just let it spread up your wrist, up your arm, both sides. 10, 9, and around the back of your neck. 8, and then let it be kind of a cocoon, Michelle, so it sort of embraces all around your upper torso and head. 7, 6, and your hands are just really floating and they're weightlessly as you do that. So you can put your attention on other things. Such as thinking about that positive relationship. And so, a specific aspects of it that might come to mind as I speak. I worked with a woman once in West Palm Beach who had of all the things that gone right or wrong in her life, just the best sense of her relationship with her child that she was able to kindle by thinking about all the photos she kept in her wallet. 9, 8, and let it move on down your hips and down your thighs and butt. And as she sat there thinking about all the pictures she changed in her wallet over the last nine years. Places in the back of your mind that have to do with pride, we couldn't just say what those are. Bring pride into the foreground, begin to bring tone to your cheeks and color your face. And as she did that she flipped to another picture, and another one. So gradually and little by little six, five, and let the feeling go down into your legs and feet. Four she began to have experiences of motherhood that you couldn't put words to. Sacrifices that she made and feelings that she was able to share that she never known she'd be able to share. That gave her a sense of pride not only maturity. An identity that inevertingly she had formed for herself through the relationship. 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:10
STEPHEN LANKTON And the recognition that even though she had taken a great deal by learning that identity she hadn't taken away from her son at all, she had only given. And somehow there's only tax on receiving. Five, four and then notice as you have your own experiences how it gives certain shape to the muscle toneness in your cheeks and your lips, the corner of your eyes where a sense of your own balance comes into the foreground and. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:00
STEPHEN LANKTON It's all right to shift your awareness from time to time to let joy that you feel, adjust your breathing and maybe even feeling your heart beating in your chest. So many people fail to take the time to associate their good feelings to their heart. Now give lip service to it, but they don't really do it. So, while you're feeling those feelings of pride and joy, being touched there's the rhythm of your own heart beat. Because that brings those feelings to your face and to your shoulders, to your legs, and to your abdomen. Takes those hormones and those chemicals all over your body and increases your. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Immune system functioning simply by taking the time to pay attention to your own joy and your own pride and confidence and associated it to your heart. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:20
STEPHEN LANKTON And you couldn't consciously know how you do that but sooner or later your conscious symbols of doing that create the unconscious experience so that new ideas can be formed in your mind. And one of those ideas can be your conscious efforts to matching yourself, taking another step in your own personal growth. Picture yourself as you probably will look in the next few weeks and months. While you continue to hold that experience in your heart and your breathing. And you don't even need to know whether or not you're succeeding in any particular phase as long as you have those fleeting sensations of imagining and picturing that. Michelle, as she dresses for the interviews, she applies to the academy. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
STEPHEN LANKTON As she drives day after day to daycare and to the training. And there will be so many things you'll say hello and good bye to along the way. Their own private life that has to be sacrificed so that you can attend. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
STEPHEN LANKTON And the studying that you have to do. But add some other people to that picture while you continue to do what you were doing with your body. Picture people that you have to say, no I'm sorry I am busy too. Telling you friends you have to study. Figuring out how you can retain that same sense of confidence and pride and joy and deep compassion about your own life. 

00:50:20
[sil.] 

00:50:20
STEPHEN LANKTON As you deal with their jokes about you're carrying weapons and learning about self-defense, law. You might even do well, to picture yourself in a room somewhere with friends who are criticizing you. Telling you're to, this and that. You're to blind, you're too short, you're too feminine, you're too old, you're too something. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:51:00
STEPHEN LANKTON So watch yourself from beginning to end those scenarios as you take your maturity and your determination, and sense of centerness and hold on to that and not be drawed off by their criticisms. And notice there's no self-criticism going on in your own head. Just breathing comfortably, feeling tears down your cheek. Knowing it's partially due to your own self-made womanhood. 

00:51:45
[sil.] 

00:51:50
STEPHEN LANKTON One of the things that was really sad about the woman I was describing was that as she pictured her child through those years she had to relate the fact that her own mother had never seen her, her own mother had never had pictures of her in her wallet because of death and disease. She wasn't able to reach in and pull back into the foreground her own sense of bringing joy to a parent the way her child brought joy to her. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:25
STEPHEN LANKTON And the sorrow that she felt then. That relationship was gone, the loss of knowing the joy she would bring was enough. It was great and it was appreciated. Some people fail to realize that even though the raise children and the joy of having that child has meant so much to you that their own growth they don't realize how, as a child they meant that much to their parents. Maybe the parents never told them. Maybe there were so many other outside problems to deal with. The opportunity never arose. 

00:53:15
[sil.] 

00:53:15
STEPHEN LANKTON But that pride works both ways. So, as you feel the pride in you own relationship with your son know that it wasn't there except for something that came from your own heart. Your own ability to give. 

00:53:40
[sil.] 

00:53:40
STEPHEN LANKTON And some people think that you should do this and that an the other thing. But remember that Kat Steven song that said, "if they were right, I'd agree. But it's them they know not me." 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And it's great that you know what you want to do or what you want to try. Even if no one else understands. And so many times she wished that she would of been able to turn a parent who flashed a smile of joy back at her but she remembered all those flashes of joy that her own son gave her and she felt that joy any way. And picture yourself being criticized by those people but knowing that it's not effecting your own confidence. And once you've seen that in that picture Michelle, just for the fun of it change the in the picture but keep your feelings the same. And let that be that eight and nine year old Michelle that you see out there. And watch and listen as she is criticized but you retain the sense of your worth, and your value, and your strength while you watch so that it will change those memories to some level. And when those are rekindled by unexpected criticisms and rejections something new in your mind can be triggered that has to do with you, the strength you've gained by being a mom. You don't even need to know how it works. The conscious mind can discover that your unconscious is surprising you with a recognition that you're breathing, enjoying air going in and out. 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:50
STEPHEN LANKTON And then project that picture up into the the 29-year old Michelle, 30-year old Michelle, and the graduating from the academy Michelle, and the officer Michelle. And see graduation and wonder whether or not you'll have the capacity to hold as much pride in your face and in your posture as you really deserve for all that accomplishment. You might as well feel the success of it now. Some people wait until success is over before they feel the pride of having completed it. But you might as well feel it. Even before you do it and take that joy with you. All right. 

00:56:40

STEPHEN LANKTON Second book was being written and I decided to imagine with joy the signing of autographs of the book long before I ever started it. And then all of the pitfalls along the way weren't a sign that I was going to fall, they were simply pitfalls that happened until I succeeded. So imagine a couple of the pitfalls that you might have along the way. Running out of money, illnesses, weather problems, transportation problems. Sexism you'll run into. And you might also picture at how you succeed at overcoming each of those, while your at it. 

00:57:35
[sil.] 

00:57:35
STEPHEN LANKTON And there's some other things that you're going to do after that that you haven't thought of it. Maybe they'll be just a big blank screen trying to find yourself in those pictures. What Michelle's going to do at 35, at 41, 45, 51. 

00:58:05

00:58:05
STEPHEN LANKTON One of my friends in Germany was walking along in the woods just distraught about what he was going to do with a problem and he fell asleep leaning against a tree. And he dreamed that an older man came walking a long the walk and sat down beside him and they started talking. It turns out the older man was him, in older age, he says he was a Wolf. Wolf talks to the older man and says, what in the world did I ever do about that problem that I encountered back in the 1990's. The older Wolf said, "I don't remember what problem do you mean." He said," You remember the problem with", and he described all the difficulty in great detail. The old man said,"Oh, yeah, I don't know. That passed." And he woke up so happy to realize that what had been troubling him was just an insignificant temporary little worry. And somebody that you haven't been able to see as you look into the future to find the Michelle that your unconscious may fail to form for your conscious mind. Notice too, how you'll overcome those experiences, leave them in the past, and the guilt will have fallen away and the self-criticism will be laughably forgotten. I wonder what she looks like and when you'll know her. Sooner or later you will know her. As your conscious mind failing to understand how unconscious will come to know her won't prevent it from happening any sooner. And whether or not you just feel better and don't know why you actually recognized that you've dropped that self-criticism and guilt and some confidence remains. And maybe a confidence you feel in your breathing, your posture, confidence in your face. The feeling you have in your legs, your arms and chest. Or relaxation somewhere that you can bring back with you as you, two, three, four, five. Begin to reorient yourself back into the chair. Six, seven, and before you do you might want to imagine again that sense of falling through the funnel and down to the bottom of the chair. And with that sense of comfort and relaxation and security in the chair imagine yourself walking up to a second story window and looking out with comfort. 

01:01:15
[sil.] 

01:01:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Realizing that, that too, that thing about heights is not the same as before either. 

01:01:30
[sil.] 

01:01:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Or maybe make a picture of yourself swimming with your son somewhere and realize that there you are doing the back stroke and you weren't even thinking for a second about that old childhood fear. Whatever it was that you couldn't quite bring to mind but you were trying but you knew it had been there. But you just couldn't remember it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and just orient yourself back to the room. 17, 18, 19, 20, as you do, as you bring some of those feelings that you want open your eyes and come back to the room. Your hands can go back down to your lap. 

01:02:30
[sil.] 

01:02:30
MICHELLE I need this. 

01:02:35
STEPHEN LANKTON You end up with the Kleenex after all. 

01:02:40
[sil.] 

01:02:40
STEPHEN LANKTON How do you feel? 

01:02:40
MICHELLE Very good. That was a lot. 

01:02:45
STEPHEN LANKTON What? 

01:02:45
MICHELLE That was a lot. 

01:02:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. There was a lot, it was a lot of imagination going on in your mind and a lot of feelings. 

01:02:50
MICHELLE Oh yeah, it was a lot. I couldn't dream that much in one night. 

01:03:00
STEPHEN LANKTON All right so, is it still in the seat here. 

01:03:00
MICHELLE No. 

01:03:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Just going on, but your not thinking about it. 

01:03:05
MICHELLE No, I'm not. 

01:03:05
STEPHEN LANKTON But it's still going on in the back of your mind isn't it. 

01:03:10
MICHELLE You know, like when you wake up and you try to remember a dream, it's gone, you know. Sometimes you can get pieces of it. I was actually still trying to keep up with myself was kind of hard. 

01:03:20
STEPHEN LANKTON You uh, you don't um, actually remember what, already what you were thinking? 

01:03:25
MICHELLE Some of it, yeah. I mean 

01:03:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh. Do you know how much time you had your eyes closed for? 

01:03:25
MICHELLE No, I have no idea. 

01:03:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Take a guess. 

01:03:30
MICHELLE 10, 15 minutes. 

01:03:35
STEPHEN LANKTON 10, 15 um, I think it was um, about 25 maybe. 

01:03:40
MICHELLE Oh, okay. 

01:03:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Ah yeah. And do you have a sense that it's still kind of processing. It kind of looks by looking at your. Uh, when I don't talk your eyes dart off. You know, it's kind of like this, there's stuff still processing in the back there. Do you have that sense? 

01:03:55
MICHELLE Well, yeah. 

01:03:55
STEPHEN LANKTON That's good because those are the things that are making associations that you'll find uh, um, sort of impinging on your conscious mind from time to time. It's like little moments of, of revelation. Hey, I'm noticing how I've got these resources that I'm using and I feel really good about it. Ah, you were crying, you know. 

01:04:20
MICHELLE Yeah, it took me a little while before I realized that. I didn't, I didn't notice it until you said something. 

01:04:25
STEPHEN LANKTON What were the tears? 

01:04:30
MICHELLE I don't remember. 

01:04:30
STEPHEN LANKTON You've been crying quite a bit. 

01:04:30
MICHELLE I know. And I don't remember. I don't remember initially. 

01:04:35
STEPHEN LANKTON How do you? 

01:04:35
MICHELLE Because I heard you say something, and then I, then I realized. 

01:04:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh. 

01:04:40
MICHELLE That I was crying. I didn't jump out of my skin when you said that. 

01:04:45
STEPHEN LANKTON How do you feel now? Do you feel good? 

01:04:45
MICHELLE Okay, yeah. 

01:04:45
STEPHEN LANKTON You're certainly not discombobulated at all. 

01:04:50
MICHELLE No, I, I cry no matter what. 

01:04:50
STEPHEN LANKTON You cry no matter what? 

01:04:50
MICHELLE Yeah, it doesn't matter and movies. 

01:04:55
STEPHEN LANKTON So, if you try intuitively process just what you were doing. Is there, does it feel complete enough that we can stop? Is there a missing door that's not willing to close, do you think. 

01:05:10
MICHELLE No, no I don't think so. Again it was a lot. It's probably going to come back to me for the next week. 

01:05:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh, so you feel like a good time to stop, though. Would you say? 

01:05:20
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:05:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Anything else that you can think of that comes to mind before we do? 

01:05:25
MICHELLE No not really. My minds completely. 

01:05:30
STEPHEN LANKTON (crosstalk) took a vacation, didn't you. 

01:05:35
MICHELLE I did. 

01:05:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, maybe you should close your eyes for a second, see if there's anything that you need to bring back with you there. 

01:05:45
[sil.] 

01:05:50
MICHELLE No, no. I don't. 

01:05:55
STEPHEN LANKTON I don't even think you're going to remember me at the end of this. 

01:05:55
MICHELLE No, I'm not that bad. 

01:05:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay. 

01:05:55
MICHELLE I don't go that far away. 

01:05:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay. 

01:06:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, then let's stop and uh, move and wrap up and leave. 

01:06:00
MICHELLE Okay. 

01:06:00
STEPHEN LANKTON It was nice meeting you. 

01:06:05
MICHELLE It was nice meeting you. 

01:06:05
STEPHEN LANKTON I wish you had a few more thoughts at the end of this thing that you could share, so we know that uh, so we have some definitive brilliant feedback of some kind. But uh, it's certainly understandable that you don't. 

01:06:15
MICHELLE No, no. 

01:06:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh, by the way, uh, on that topic if you imagined yourself going uh back, back to the police academy soon. 

01:06:20
MICHELLE Mm-hmm. Well, I have to actually test first. I have go and get it done. Uh, a written test and a physical agility test, and I still have to train. 

01:06:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Mmm. 

01:06:35
MICHELLE Just to take the test. 

01:06:35
STEPHEN LANKTON How do you feel about your capability exam? 

01:06:40
MICHELLE Um, well, first I have to train. Um, my capability to train I have no problem with but I think it's um, I, the reason I say I'm going to it with a whole lot of with like a really high expectations like when I come out and they're going to have a list and I'm going to be the first one on it. Um, it's just because I know there's a lot of really qualified people doing it for a long time who probably also do the same thing. Um, but um, as far as my capability, I completely believe that I can do it. Um, I, I thoroughly believe that I'll pass. How well, I pass. 

01:07:15
STEPHEN LANKTON How well you get. 

01:07:15
MICHELLE That doesn't matter. Yeah. 

01:07:15
STEPHEN LANKTON But if you get. 

01:07:20
MICHELLE If I'm number 2 or number 22, that doesn't matter to me. 

01:07:20
STEPHEN LANKTON So that's no problem. 

01:07:25
MICHELLE No, as far as I'm concerned. I go and I take it and I pass it. I, you know, to personal for me. 

01:07:30
STEPHEN LANKTON I think you'll make a very fair and just uh, police officer. 

01:07:35
MICHELLE I, I actually do have a lot of um, I've gotten very, very little criticism from people about that. Very, very little, actually none. 

01:07:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, good luck to you. 

01:07:45
MICHELLE Thank you, very much. 

01:07:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Nice meeting you. Thanks for coming out and taking the risk of talking to a total stranger. 

01:07:50
MICHELLE Not a problem. 

01:07:50
STEPHEN LANKTON All right, good thanks. 

01:07:55
MICHELLE Thank you. 

01:07:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Let's uh, wrap it up. 

01:08:00
[sil.] 

01:08:00
JON CARLSON As we look at the video now, we're about 15 minutes into the interview with this very interesting woman who came wanting personal growth and indicating the she really didn't have any problems but then went on to delineate several things that she needed to change. What did you do to get her to this point? 

01:08:25
Stephen Lankton, M.S.W. ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY 

01:08:25
STEPHEN LANKTON There's always about uh, four or five things you're doing in any given time in the assessment period. One of the thing that's different here is we covered the uh, together and we looked at the inner personal checklist results that she filled out the raw score on that. 

01:08:40
JON CARLSON That's an adjective checklist? 

01:08:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Right, and uh, it, it gives us a picture uh, of the resources that she sees, herself image for solving problems and in this case it really stood out that she she has uh, a lot of skill, if you will, a lot of desire to please other people. Uh, self-criticism, self-doubt is pretty high. Uh, avoidance of dependency uh, I didn't say all those words exactly like that to her but, uh. And inability to uh, withdraw and say no, and set some limits as well. Which is a good sign to see for a, a single person, a single woman especially. 

01:09:15
JON CARLSON The process that you were using were there some series of steps or? 

01:09:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh yeah, we're always looking for uh, you, you got to draw some distinctions uh, assessing the interpersonal style of the person and those distinctions give you a bit of a clue to the uh, psycho-social dynamics of things. Uh, we uh, you want to find out what the conflict is that the person is trying to solve. We have something to hold on to and make sense with therapy. And uh, and as that develops a way the resources and flexibility that the person has against the developmental demands being made to reach those goals. That's what I'm trying to accomplish in this first few minutes. 

01:09:55
JON CARLSON Let's move on right now to this piece we're going to see her talking about what it was like uh, to be small and frail around the age of nine. 

01:10:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Take me back, what's the earliest time you feel, uh, you begin feeling this way. 

01:10:15
MICHELLE Hmm. 

01:10:20
[sil.] 

01:10:20
MICHELLE I just, I remember um, when I was, when I was younger probably my son's age maybe a little bit younger I used, I used to get picked up a lot, a lot like he is now. Um, I was small. I was very, very small. I was very tiny, very petite, very frail. So it was real easy even, you know. 

01:10:45
STEPHEN LANKTON This is uh, third or fourth grade? 

01:10:45
MICHELLE Um, yeah. Third and fourth, second, third grade. Second and third grade. And I never. 

01:10:55
STEPHEN LANKTON So you seen it as though peers not really making you feel welcomed. 

01:11:00
MICHELLE Yeah. So I grow into this I want everybody to like me kind of person. And wanting all of these friends but then I get this other side of it, that I'm actually okay, without half of them. Um, but yeah, I think kind of, I, I would have to say if I had, I had to pinpoint anything that would probably be it. 

01:11:25
STEPHEN LANKTON You didn't, and you went home and said, hey I'm getting picked on and. 

01:11:30
MICHELLE No, I didn't, I never said anything. 

01:11:30
STEPHEN LANKTON So you kept it to yourself. Why? 

01:11:35
MICHELLE I didn't, I don't know. I wish I did because then I'd know why my son didn't tell me. And I, and I. 

01:11:40
JON CARLSON What did it meant to you, Stephen that she was describing being picked on and not telling anybody about it? 

01:11:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Let's see a couple of things here that um, are crucial with the assessment. You, and observing carefully her face you see the uh, uh, dry mouth swallowing, looking away from, check muscles changing, cringing, and reporting that she uh, was uh, not being of the standards of her friends, and then uh, almost hostile towards herself. Uh, as describing she's frail, petite, and sort of the qualities some people would be pretty pleased with but you could tell of course, that she wasn't. And then she doesn't go home and tell her parents that she's being picked on. So we see uh, here both the need to please other people and her last criticism, and her avoidance of dependency. The three things that we also picked up earlier in the chart but here we have uh, her own uh, memory of it as opposed to some abstraction. 

01:12:45
JON CARLSON And so, this is something that happened in her developmental history. 

01:12:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Right, and this uh, this fits uh, as an iteration note. The same thing that she initially was thinking of seeking therapy about. Here she is, she said at the age of eight or nine uh, getting uh, uh, something not retrieved properly in her development so she could handle this in a more effective way. Now she has an eight or nine year old child and presto she doesn't know what exactly one does as a parent to help a child through this stage. So um, there's it's kind of a uh, compounding and stacking of uh, of her experience as both what do I do as a child at this age, what does a parent do with a child of this age, what should I have gotten. What do I now do? So really have uh, uh, crucial fixation almost of developmental difficulty. 

01:13:30
DIANE KJOS And her son is having the some problems that echos hers. 

01:13:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Right. She thought he did. 

01:13:35
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:13:35
STEPHEN LANKTON She couldn't accurately assess that in her and now she knows that problems over with, with her son. But you see her, her guilt in how to handle her son at that stage. And so, that self doubt really, really grows strongly right from this spot and that's going to be one of the key spots we're going to have to readdress when therapy begins. 

01:13:55
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:13:55
JON CARLSON And your observational skills are very acute. I mean they focus right in on very specific aspects and changes in her physiology. 

01:14:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Right, uh, it's called ideomotor behavior. I want to know when she gets a new idea, does this change her behavior and motor behavior in some way because if it does it gives us by watching those little changes in her face, her breathing, her skin tone, or her uh, and so on. We, we see oh, oh there went a thought that she was uncomfortable with. I wonder what that thought was. And what, what triggered, did I say, what are we discussing, what are the context that triggered that thought. So we uh, the client really doesn't need to verbalize uh, everything. I don't need to get her to, oh, gee. To get her feel uncomfortable about that didn't you because I can see that those things were uncomfortable. 

01:14:45
JON CARLSON Wow. 

01:14:45
DIANE KJOS So, picking up a lot of those visual cues that we're going to use later on. 

01:14:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Right, and, and also you're not really tipping your hat with regard to, I'm building a hypothesis but that may not be right. I may have to throw it out later on. And you're not uh, making a client defensive about the hypothesis you're building. You're simply observing those things and then going on, see if they reoccur. 

01:15:05
JON CARLSON In the next segment you going to introduce her to hypnosis. What is crucial in the induction process? 

01:15:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Well crucial in the introduction of hypnosis is to make sure that the clients have uh, non mythological understanding what's about to happen. That, that they understand, and probably the key, three key elements I think. One is that all hypnosis is self-hypnosis. Uh, that the uh, hypnosis itself is a heightened state of awareness of, a heightened state of concentration of events. 

01:15:35
JON CARLSON Rather than an anesthetic or something. 

01:15:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Right. Or rather than a numb state of consciousness like a coma. And but it's an internal event. So, the person is concentrating on their own experience not concentrating on me somehow. 

01:15:45
JON CARLSON Oh, okay. 

01:15:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And then, and then the third piece concerns me. That is that the suggestions that the operator makes is simply suggestions for every person to uh, uh, apply to their own experience. And those suggestions should be modified if they don't fit, discarded if they're way off base, or followed if they're helpful. Uh, then after probing the first comment that all hypnosis is self-hypnosis is sometimes useful with the client who is a little bit uh, wary in the first place to clearly present it as I'm going to teach you self-hypnosis. And in this case it was perfectly because she wants to do personal growth, so why not say, hey we're going to teach you self-hypnosis for your own personal growth to continue later on. 

01:16:25
DIANE KJOS Wow, yeah. 

01:16:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Was uh, uh, and the way I see things going is, if, if we can do hypnosis successfully in 25 minutes here and get you to, uh. Hypnosis is a state of heightened concentration where you, where you turn your awareness on internal experiences. If that internal experience you can get a hold of and magnify that then why can't we take that and have you project that into these future things that you haven't done and you want to do. Uh, sort of like uh, uh, a pre- uh, coding all of those future experiences with this confidence that you gain from the relationship with him. And, and uh, then those aren't events that you're going to, going to sort of uh, hap haphazardly hoping that you hit upon a good feeling of confidence as you go. Your brains already going to have put one in that neuro situation. I don't really know what those are, what those things are that you haven't done yet but you do. I don't think, I need to know really. 

01:17:30
MICHELLE Ah, I think the, the test is, is probably. 

01:17:35
STEPHEN LANKTON That police thing. 

01:17:35
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:17:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Police Academy and your graduation, that's a huge part of it. 

01:17:40
MICHELLE A lot of um, some, some things that I've just been afraid of for all my life. 

01:17:45
STEPHEN LANKTON You want to just name a couple for me. 

01:17:45
MICHELLE Heights. Last year, I uh, uh, I've always been uh, terribly afraid of heights, I have an incredible phobia of heights, falling, or drowning. I don't know anybody, you know, that's not afraid of drowning. Um, but those were always things that I. 

01:17:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Jacques Crusteo, I could say. So have you been in trance before? 

01:18:00
JON CARLSON Okay what was happening in this segment, Stephen? 

01:18:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, I wanted to make sure that understood the uh, the format that we were going to follow. I didn't, sometimes you can let it flow between the two of you. But there uh, there's uh, sense of her not revealing much about herself and not, not having uh, uh a strong focus to begin with it. And maybe want to tell her exactly how we're going to proceed. So she didn't feel the least bit uh, uh, surprised as we, we do this simple procedure as uh, the simple procedure having to do with treating the experience of confidence and pride and delight in whatever she has about raising her son. It gives her the greatest sense of strength. And then projecting that into the goals she has of the future. That is a reasonable thing to do and people don't know how to do it. So, that, that's what I outline that we would do. Uh, you see a couple of other things here. Uh, her need to please, her strong suggestibility. Uh, she's uh, I told her I didn't really need to know those other things and she might be uh, uh, interested in applying this to. And she quickly uh, volunteered immediately. So, uh, actually it's a good sign. It's shows her ego strength, it shows her ability uh, quickly pull other resources, just in a inter personal context of trying to please everybody. She's not really asking for help her so much, you know, as she is trying to please me by giving up an answer. But it makes her quite suggestible. 

01:19:25
JON CARLSON I'm wondering if she had the same experience that I did as I watched this. As I just began to feel comfortable with you and to began to feel even more comfortable with the process that I was in. 

01:19:35
STEPHEN LANKTON I hope so, yeah. Well, she's certainly comfortable enough to start volunteering things that she wasn't volunteering for the first 15 minutes, yeah. 

01:19:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:19:45
STEPHEN LANKTON So the first thing that we're doing here in this actual experience with hypnosis is having her try one of two techniques I intend to show her. I think I'm going to do that at this point. It depends on how the first one goes. But uh, you can lead your concentration to hypnosis in a couple of different ways. The first one relies on her visualizing and then shifting to a feeling. And uh, the next one will go the other way around. If you do both of them, I'm expecting the second one should exemplify a great depth trance than the first one because of the process called flatenation(ph) where you repeatedly uh, experience trance and come out of it in short spurts. Now next step is imagine that you begin to uh, travel down that tube and as you do it kind of a third step, let your eyes gradually gently roll upward a bit so that you can imagine seeing the hole of the funnel getting further above your head. 

01:20:35
MICHELLE Okay. 

01:20:35
STEPHEN LANKTON So, imagination heightens your sense of dropping down to your center of gravity. 

01:20:40
MICHELLE I'm going to fall. 

01:20:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. And then you'll fall for just a second and you'll hit the chair where your butt meets the chair with relaxation. And then when you do, I should see the movement shift, so I'll know you made it. 

01:20:55
[sil.] 

01:20:55
STEPHEN LANKTON And now when you got to that relaxation you should be there by now, it's only a short step. And I'm going to ask you to hold to that don't move your awareness out of that spot for a couple of minutes because it takes two or three minutes for your awareness to gel on that relaxation. So, while you're doing that. 

01:21:20
JON CARLSON What did you learn from this particular segment? 

01:21:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, not much yet. I uh, I'm not uh, as confident on her, some of her non verbals. Her cheeks are flattened out a little bit, her breathing changed. But it appeared she followed the directions. Um, I was glad that when she tried to express her fear of falling, the context of this that she was willing to drop, that shows that she's manipulative for attention in those ways. That's a good sign of her real devotion in trying to prove herself as oppose to, to uh, you know, take the wrong kind of support and attention through manipulation. 

01:21:55
DIANE KJOS Do you use that follow-up approach because she talked about fear of falling? 

01:22:00
STEPHEN LANKTON No, not particularly. But I have used it before with people who are claustrophobic, having fears of heights and falling that have a problem with it. So, uh, I thought skip by really quickly when we do it. 

01:22:10
JON CARLSON Let's move on to the second form that you used. Right now. 

01:22:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Now uh, I'll count forward even though you might can switch your eyes open real quick anyway. But uh, two, three, four, five, six. You're pretty relaxed. You really look absorbed pretty quickly in that. Now this other way is a slightly more um, feeling oriented way, sort of visual oriented way. And see which one works best for you. Put your hands about uh, half inch apart and then not touching anything as you do this one. And holding for just a second your eyes opened, focusing on your fingers. And as you relax you're probably feel a little tingle or uh, uh, pulsation, um, some kind of, almost feels magnetic to some people. You probably should leave your legs uncrossed too because something's going to get real heavy if we succeed. And as you relax and start to feel the little tingling in them, let me know. In your fingertips. As you relax your hands you should feel sort of pulsing or tingling, do you feel that. 

01:23:20
MICHELLE Neither one of them. 

01:23:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Sure, close your eyes as you as you hear me, maybe that will help. Can you feel more than one of them yet? 

01:23:30
MICHELLE Yeah. 

01:23:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, this is a suddle feeling, so I want you to hold on to it and do this with your eyes closed. Move your awareness from the spot where you feel it, about a half inch up towards your palm, and just and all the fingers and just wait there until you feel the feeling kind of catch up with that. 

01:23:50
[sil.] 

01:23:50
STEPHEN LANKTON And then move your awareness another half-inch up towards your palm, hold it there and wait for a second and then the feeling will catch up with that. 

01:24:05
[sil.] 

01:24:05
STEPHEN LANKTON And I'm going to be shining a flashlight in front of it. Puppy here something that keeps following your unconscious experience, so just keep following it. Does that, hands working out for you? 

01:24:20
MICHELLE Uh, I'm sorry. 

01:24:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay, it's working. Did that? Is it working? Do you feel uh, the feeling catching up with your awareness? 

01:24:30
MICHELLE In, in some spots. 

01:24:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, you don't need to feel it everywhere. 

01:24:30
MICHELLE Okay. 

01:24:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, that seemed to be. 

01:24:35
JON CARLSON Wow, she sure went into a trance quickly. I saw you, you looked like you were catching a fly or doing something and she didn't move. 

01:24:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, there was a fly in the room. It was very large, and uh, and the entire uh, rapid movement to break in the physical repore that people general sense and then uh, squashing it as it where. I bumped the table, she didn't hear any of those sounds and uh, and wasn't paying much attention to me. When person uh, the, the beauty of, of any of these is it's clear that it's heightened awareness internally then. So in this one it's especially so. It's a suddle internally that people don't pay attention to. When her awareness uh, shifts to her feelings, they, she is really in a altered state you might say for her. Her normal state is to be much more visually aware of the world. And uh, and this is confirmation of that. It also supports some of the other things we noticed that, that she has inner avoidance of her dependency needs and expressing her dependency. She's not very well in touch with her feelings. When she gets there she's in an altered state. She would spend much time there because she doesn't have much capability of operating well in that sort of state. Uh, but, anyway this, this induction is going to uh, be the one to continue to use and maybe it worked better because we did a shorter one just prior to that. So, when we do the third time again. You know I have quite a strong uh, compliance from her uh, trance induction. 

01:26:00
DIANE KJOS So, moving in an out makes for a stronger, a deeper trance? 

01:26:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Right, right. In hypnosis, which in literature is called vaux fascination technique, and it's like in Gestal(ph) therapy were you shuttle between awakening state and shuttle between the fantasy your having and back to the awakening state and back to the fantasy. Both of them become a little more enriched because you sort your experience according to those two polarities. So here the polarity is awakened state and trance. 

01:26:25
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:26:30
JON CARLSON In this next segment what we're going to see if the first of two stories that you tell. And this one has to do with West Palm Beach. Uh, can you talk about stories story-telling in you approach. How does that fit? 

01:26:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, the entire uh, matter of the approach is, you mentioned is the uh, uh, retrieval of experiences so that uh, through the experiential life you're having made some new associations, have some new resources, and options available to you. Uh, a metaphor, a story uh, sometimes called metaphor wrongly probably. But the, the use of the story allows the person to voluntarily select the participation to the degree that they wish. No one is actually told someone to have that experience that strongly but it's offered as uh, uh, with some ambiguity so the person can. Uh, and that's a probe that ambiguity a bit to, to say uh, if we give you this much latitude will you take it. How much, how much does this fit for you? 

01:27:25
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:27:25
STEPHEN LANKTON And if that person uh, finds that's a useful then they step into that story and play a role temporarily. So, in that role they're not themselves. As myself, I can't have experience XYZ but if I play this role I can have experience XYZ because that's not me. So the story gives them temporary reality through which they can have novel experiences. 

01:27:50
JON CARLSON So as a, in your brand of therapy you must have a lot of stories that you can call upon to fit different situations. 

01:27:55
STEPHEN LANKTON You think, but I found it's easier to have uh, sort if a process for constructing new stories as opposed to um, memorizing 6,000 stories. I could have, I could have five or six processes that I use to construct a story to retrieve an emotion or retrieve attitude or to heighten behavioral senses, so. 

01:28:20
DIANE KJOS And you watch her, her visual cues, through, your watching her face and so on, to see how this stories working then? And are you. 

01:28:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Your, your eyes observing to see whether or not some set of words uh, had a different meaning to the client than you expected. Uh, uh, you're trying to speak the language of the client. Of course in this case the metaphor of the woman who was uh, changing her experience by thinking about her relationship with her son is, is uh, is exactly using the very resource she suggested to me that, that supplied her strength to her. And so I want to speak in terms of her own language as much as possible. But I might, as I'm planning ahead I expect to be able to uh, alter the, the way the story is going to unfold to uh, strike at uh, a developmental twist I don't think she's thought of or spoken about. 

01:29:05
JON CARLSON Let's watch it now. 

01:29:10
STEPHEN LANKTON I worked with a woman once in West Palm Beach who had of all the things that gone right or wrong in her life, just the best sense of her relationship with her child that she was able to kindle by thinking about all the photos she kept in her wallet. 9, 8, and let it move on down your hips and down your thighs and butt. And as she sat there thinking about all the pictures she changed in her wallet over the last nine years. Places in the back of your mind that have to do with pride, we couldn't just say what those are. Bring pride into the foreground, begin to bring tone to your cheeks and color your face. And as she did that she flipped to another picture, and another one. So gradually and little by little six, five, and let the feeling go down into your legs and feet. Four she began to have experiences of motherhood that you couldn't put words to. Sacrifices that she made and feelings that she was able to share that she never known she'd be able to share. That gave her a sense of pride not only maturity. An identity that inevertingly she had formed for herself through the relationship. 

01:30:55
[sil.] 

01:31:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And the recognition that even though she had taken a great deal by learning that identity she hadn't taken away from her son at all, she had only given. 

01:31:10
JON CARLSON In that segment there were some physical changes going on with her. Can you talk about those? 

01:31:15
STEPHEN LANKTON As Diane was mentioning paying close attention the client's reactions when you're speaking because the, the hopefully the things you're saying are, are touching experiences for the client that they're coming into awareness. And that uh, gives them an opportunity to, to have a true inside in a sense that they're internal experiences have given them sight about them. 

01:31:40
JON CARLSON Right. 

01:31:40
STEPHEN LANKTON And, and uh, she uh, obviously raised her eyebrow up on her right side uh, twice uh, to illustrate to me that she hadn't looked at it that way before. That she didn't realize that her identity had been formed and strengthened and that she had grown. Now while she said it, she actually said words along those lines. This was uh, hearing it come back as changing her self image that I guess she hadn't quite but together that way before. That her uh, that she had formed a certain kind of strength and identity. She didn't know she had uh, prior to that. It was like, oh yes, that pulled out of me a growth that I didn't realize was, i could have pulled out of me. I didn't realize it was in me. Now as I, see the development of her therapy session there's a couple of important pieces that are crucial to having made this a success. One of them is the uh, contract. One of them is the retrieval of the experience and the meaning of that. Which we just saw on the last clip. And uh, I want to position that for two things. The first thing I want to position that for is to, is to keep my agreement with her that we're uh, uh, have her post-hypnotically link you might say uh, that experience to anticipate it moments of anxiety in her future. And that uh, has to do with her, her police academy work and some other things. 

01:33:00
JON CARLSON And those changes she knew needs to be done. 

01:33:05
Stephen Lankton, M.S.W. ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY 

01:33:05
STEPHEN LANKTON And, and while we doing that, we're doing, we're taking a piece where her self criticism is not a component. We're taking a piece where she's able to think of herself in those scenes and in those situations, free of criticism and with a present sense of confidence and pride and capability. So let's take a look. 

01:33:25
[sil.] 

01:33:30
STEPHEN LANKTON As she drives day after to day to daycare and to the training. And there will be so many things you'll say hello and good bye to along the way. Their own private life that has to be sacrificed so that you can attend. 

01:33:50
[sil.] 

01:33:55
STEPHEN LANKTON And the studying that you have to do. But add some other people to that picture while you continue to do what you were doing with your body. Picture people that you have to say, no I'm sorry I am busy too. Telling you friends you have to study. Figuring out how you can retain that same sense of confidence and pride and joy and deep compassion about your own life. 

01:34:25
[sil.] 

01:34:25
STEPHEN LANKTON As you deal with their jokes about you're carrying weapons and learning about self-defense, law. You might even do well, to picture yourself in a room somewhere with friends who are criticizing you. Telling you're to, this and that. You're to blind, you're too short, you're too feminine, you're too old, you're too something. 

01:35:00
[sil.] 

01:35:05
STEPHEN LANKTON The piece that I want to um, leverage from that resources that we're building from this metaphor. is the one where uh, she wouldn't expect and we haven't spoken about. But it, but it strikes the developmental issue that we've seen in terms of her visual appearance. I don't know if you noticed she actually looks about nine years old. 

01:35:20
JON CARLSON She does, yeah. 

01:35:25
STEPHEN LANKTON And she mentioned that that was a source of criticism. We see her looking a little bit guilty and defensive when she, just for a moment she spoke about her pregnancy and she doesn't ask for help from her mother. She doesn't know how to parent her nine year old child. So I'm uh, uh, certain that if we can, if I can use this metaphor and turn it around like a generalization sort of. Use something like this, I have confidence and pride because I share those experiences with my son. So, perhaps as the child myself my parents had confidence and pride in me even if I didn't get it or hear about it, or asked for it. And so I wanted to trend the metaphor to that angle so that she can in a sense uh, now appreciate herself as a child who was perhaps bringing more joy to her parents than she was willing to notice or notice. And was great and was appreciated. Some people fail to realize that even though the raise children and the joy of having that child has meant so much to you that their own growth they don't realize how, as a child they meant that much to their parents. Maybe the parents never told them. Maybe there were so many other outside problems to deal with. The opportunity never arose. 

01:36:55
[sil.] 

01:36:55
STEPHEN LANKTON But that pride works both ways. So, as you feel the pride in you own relationship with your son know that it wasn't there except for something that came from your own heart. Your own ability to give. 

01:37:20
[sil.] 

01:37:25
JON CARLSON Those physical reactions, the tears, and the eyebrow going up and down. 

01:37:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Right. And of course, this continues for some more minutes here. Um, there, the first three comments that I made the uh, perhaps the uh, there were outside uh, contingencies that interfered with them being spoken. And uh, that was my hinder that suggestion, suggesting that it might have to do with uh, that made that, that may fit the bill, the part explaining the pregnancy for example as something that kept you from getting, hearing about it. Other, two other uh, things I mentioned and every time I mention one there may of not, it may of been there but it wasn't said. And you see her eyebrows raise up again and her eyebrows raise up again. And finally, the tears coming that uh, that she clearly is uh, emoting an experience of need that she doesn't uh, admit to and didn't ask for. So what we can see here is that the, the resource of the confidence is retrieved in, from her telling us that this was an area in which she could do it. And the metaphor helping her get there in her own way has now given her the opportunity to walk in, into an expression of her, her need. And not uh, not shy away from that. And not even be critical of herself for being frail here or for being weak, like she had been moments earlier. So she's, she's bringing her range of understanding of herself and an assessment of her past, the possibility of those dependency needs that she didn't need them. Maybe that was there and she's feeling the uh, emoting of the comfort that, that brings. 

01:39:00
DIANE KJOS Would that be change you think in her relationship with her mother through that? 

01:39:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, you would expect that and you would want to measure that in, in and follow that up in subsequent sessions, suddley of course. You wouldn't want to insinuate that she should change that but in her own time. 

01:39:15
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm. 

01:39:15
JON CARLSON This very powerful reaction continues for the next four or five minutes. And then you go on to telling another story. And this is the story of the German and the butcher man named Wolf. Can you talk about what you were attempting to do with that story? 

01:39:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, um, we have a client here who's, who's a little anxious that everything she does may be wrong. And yet, so while some good things happening with regard to reducing herself down and reducing her confidence we're still going into uh, I'm still going into a lot of detail about uh, the academy, and what people might say, and how's she's going to take the exams, and how's she's going to be a police woman. Making uh, a lot of drama about this section of her life which it deserves and all. But on the other hand in the big picture of things this means nothing. She's going to go on and have a huge life ahead of her. Uh, so it's apposite(ph) to, to put this in some perspective and say when you think back on your life in the 90's um, you're going to go what problem, what problem. And, and of course it's also suggestion that she, that she uh, take that attitude that she uh, uh, that she have her attention on other things rather than on her problems. And it's very possible to that she has amnesia a great deal for this trance and it's very possible that she will amnesia for all this little sequence of problems, problems put away. As we remember how. 

01:40:50
[sil.] 

01:40:50
STEPHEN LANKTON One of my friends in Germany was walking along in the woods just distraught about what he was going to do with a problem and he fell asleep leaning against a tree. And he dreamed that an older man came walking a long the walk and sat down beside him and they started talking. It turns out the older man was him, at an older age, he says he was a Wolf. Wolf talks to the older man and says, what in the world did I ever do about that problem that I encountered back in the 1990's. The older Wolf said, "I don't remember what problem do you mean." He said," You remember the problem with", and then he described all the difficulty in great detail. The old man said, "Oh, yeah, I don't know. That passed." And he woke up so happy to realize that what had been troubling him was just an insignificant temporary little worry. 

01:41:55
JON CARLSON Sounds like just like you described. You just laid it out for her. When you were watching her so carefully, what did you notice in he physiology? 

01:42:05
STEPHEN LANKTON At this last? 

01:42:05
JON CARLSON At this point in time, yeah. 

01:42:10
STEPHEN LANKTON At this segment here. Um, by saying, I'm also saying that it went the way I uh, hoped or whatever. It was just to see the actual experiences to make one take the turn the attitude on one's life requires more attention, more experiences put together than what's offered in these pits of words. But it's a seed that kind of, gives you a little push, like saying uh, after you get your math work done you'll probably enjoy some uh, little dip in the pool and it just gives the child an idea that there will be something afterwards that they can look forward to. It doesn't really have to, you know, lock them in. And, and I notice that she uh, uh, she retained a concentration on what was important to her. Almost like what I was saying was uh, not even listened to in some ways. She raised her eyebrows just a little bit when I mentioned the world Wolf. And uh. 

01:43:00
JON CARLSON What were you thinking when you did that? What was going? 

01:43:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Well she was (crosstalk) concentration. I uh, because, you see, what's at stake here is what I'm saying when you look back from an older age, now that itself could triggered a reaction from her and gave me more information. She could already had a self-image at an older age, she'll never make it to an older age, she'll be dead. Or, or her life will be horrible, whatever. She clearly didn't change that mood that we set. So we know that, that's in a good place. I didn't use the word Bob or Fred because uh, uh, I wanted to a degree this uh, the concept of a wolf in gender terms to somebody who's uh, hitting upon you and manipulating you. And uh, uh, taking advantage of you and if I had gotten a larger reaction from her by that little probe word wolf I would of realized she's a little more sensitive and vigilant or that there's a little bit greater chance of that happening in her way of looking at things then the way it seems to be. She accepted she thought it was unusual, accepted as a name and went on. As opposed to uh, showing me historical reaction of hitting on her to often. Which would of been tensing the eyebrows perhaps or something of that nature. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS So, you're still making some assessment here. 

01:44:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, in, in, Dr. Erickson emphasizes uh, that you can continually notice the ongoing flow. You're not, you're not accepted from the system and, and you haven't got the truth that you're then giving Valium to your, it's an ongoing uh, unfolding of the relationship. And every word you say, and every suggestion has uh, uh, the potential of going some way different then you might it would. So, you want to continually be vigilant. If uh, the clues help you stay on track as much as possible. 

01:44:50
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:44:50
JON CARLSON In this next segment you're going to be doing some confusion. Can you talk about that? 

01:44:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, yeah, you have a very smart person with uh, very uh, articulate conscious mind. And they already have a lifestyle criticizing themselves and this is what this woman has. Then uh, left to one's own devices, to left to her own devices she could still reorganize some doubt. She can't do this right, or I understood everything you said but I still doubt myself. How do you uh, uh, how do you help the person temporarily suspend that as much as possible. Well, one way is the use of interaction. One way is the use of metaphor. One way is even these hypnosis in general. And another way is confusion technique. Which um, the part you're about to hear has a multiple negative uh, sets of sentences. You say triple negative or double negative, triple negative or double negatives. And it, it is unlikely that regardless of how intelligent the person is especially when concentrating they're concentrating like this on something else on their own experience, that they could unravel these next few sentences. So as you're sitting there going what, the next thing that happens is really the point, which is in this case the bind of comparable alternatives that she can feel better, she could just notice that that sense of doubt and guilt was gone. 

01:46:15
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:46:15
STEPHEN LANKTON And that's what ends up happening. And that's what you've forgotten. I wonder what she looks like and when you'll know her. Sooner or later you will know her. As your conscious mind failing to understand how unconscious will come to know her won't prevent it from happening any sooner. And whether or not you just feel better and don't know why you actually recognized that you've dropped that self-criticism and guilt and some confidence remains. And maybe a confidence you feel in your breathing, your posture. 

01:46:50
JON CARLSON You talked about the word confidence here and you emphasize that several points. And I notice a change in her face. 

01:47:00
STEPHEN LANKTON You noticed just a little upward movement in the corners of her mouth especially on the left-side when I, I said the confidence remains. 

01:47:05
JON CARLSON Right. 

01:47:05
STEPHEN LANKTON And uh, boom there was a little recognition. 

01:47:10
DIANE KJOS Hope. 

01:47:10
STEPHEN LANKTON In the inner motor signal that uh, I, I got the experience and gives the motor behavior that shows that she's still hold on to that. 

01:47:20
JON CARLSON In this next segment you're going to come back to just a few seconds later, you're going to come back to these original fears that she talked about. These uh, fears of what height, the water, and so forth. Yeah. What were you thinking and this interview is almost over. Is this just like a tack on, add on or? 

01:47:40
STEPHEN LANKTON I uh, yeah. I almost forgot because uh, the time constraints give uh, give rise to uh, suddenly coming to an end here where you hadn't uh, on your own rhythm might, might of gotten a little more slowly. But I realize as we're coming to the end she did mention those specific things. Now, I don't know that the brief suggestions that I made to her were enough. But considering her depth of concentration in trance and the strength of the resources we were retrieved uh, there's a darn good chance that at least her attitude about this will suspend the self image that I am afraid of these things. Given an opp-, giving herself an opportunity to find out whether she is or not. And uh, we definitely have given her opportunity if I mentioned the funnel technique she originally had, when I mentioned that she brought up spontaneously, oh I might fall. Now, I bring it up and there's no flinching on, in her at all. There's a sense of confidence we just had retrieved and worked with in those other areas remains the, the driving force. Uh, it loads her state of consciousness with that kind of confidence. And so, I go ahead and bring her up to when I have her lookout. Um, I also uh, stacked together some of the pieces that give her confidence about swimming. Saying that, with your son, uh, picturing, seeing yourself with your son swimming. Uh, that, that puts swimming uh, glues that tightly to those other resources of, that uh, I'm not going to leave her with fear or lack of confidence at all. 

01:49:10
JON CARLSON And, and the reason for coming back to it, was to honor the agreement that you made with her. 

01:49:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh absolutely. Right, these were some tangible things. And if, and if the client comes out of the trance thinking that you've answered the things that you went into then, then it gives a force of closure to that uh, uh, written about closing a frame. You want the, the uh, the end of that to um, reflect the entire intention of the therapy. Kind of like the uh, old comedian that who used to uh, I can't remember his name, but he was uh, Pinky Lee or somebody. He was on television, at the end of the television show the camera wasn't turned off and he made some derogatory comments about entertaining the children. And uh, and that, that frame at the end showed that what came before was just bologna. He didn't really mean that sincerely towards the kids. That force of closure is important. So here, this increases the forces the closure. It says this is for you, this is about, this was thinking about your needs. And especially important for somebody who's doesn't usually ask for her needs to be meet. Back into the chair. Six, seven, and before you do you might want to imagine again that sense of falling through the funnel and down to the bottom of the chair. And with that sense of comfort and relaxation and security in the chair imagine yourself walking up to a second story window and looking out with comfort. 

01:50:45
[sil.] 

01:50:50
STEPHEN LANKTON Realizing that, that too, that thing about heights is not the same as before either. 

01:51:00
[sil.] 

01:51:00
JON CARLSON As we watch this you can see that she's still with you. That it seems to be working. uh, it seems to be making a lot of sense to her. Is that the read that you got as you were watching her. 

01:51:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Right. I'm not trying to uh, uh, suggest to her at this point that she's going to be free of those difficulties. They may need a little bit more work but I'm, I'm making it indirect enough in saying, that you find it, I wonder if you're going to find it, I hope that you're going to find it. Those are different then you had thought. So, I'm only trying to open uh, a window of uh, of uh, reassessment so she doesn't keep as an inert reaction thinking of herself as somebody who is afraid of heights or water. 

01:51:45
DIANE KJOS There's a possibility that she might not. 

01:51:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And that can include that she's totally free of it. 

01:51:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:51:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Or could include just the sense that, mm-hmm, somethings changing and, and that itself is a new self image. 

01:51:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:51:55
JON CARLSON Uh, and in a few seconds, more in the interview where our final clip is going to be. And uh, that's where you bring her out of the trance. Can you talk about what's happening here. 

01:52:05
STEPHEN LANKTON When someone comes out of a trance the generally will go off in and make a few statements. Generally um, leading because they have not been speaking as far as they're concerned, they have not been communicating for sometime. And there's uh, sort of fine common pathways of expression that come together at that point. And uh, so you want to listen carefully at what the person says. Uh, you want to notice what degree the activity seems to still be going on in the back of their mind and you may need to, you may need to want to, certainly an opportunity to making uh, suggestions related to their further success. You don't want to um, unless you want to act like it's all over and, and leave it alone. Uh, you certainly don't want to act like, like uh, you're doubtful how the outcome was. Because it's not over yet and that will be part of what happens. So, even if you hadn't been doubtful about it you'd want to uh, suggest to the person that they can continue to wait for the reactions to become more apparent to them, for example. 

01:53:05
JON CARLSON Because if you planted the seed that's going to germinate. Yeah. 

01:53:10
STEPHEN LANKTON You expect the seeds to grow. You can't keep digging them up to look. You have to let them sit there for a while. So, uh, I'm interested in the fact that she has a great deal of time distortion and uh, obviously a lot of amnesia, as I expected she would. 

01:53:25
DIANE KJOS She was just kind of looking around when she first comes out. 

01:53:30
JON CARLSON Welcome, welcome back. 

01:53:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Right that looking around uh, is an indication that she's uh, as you know, she keeps track of things in her mind visually and conscious mind, she's quite visual. So here she's literally telling us she's looking around to catch, to get some bits and pieces of information. There's more there than she can cope with. 

01:53:50
DIANE KJOS Oh, okay. 

01:53:50
STEPHEN LANKTON There was a lot of imagination, it was a lot of imagination going on in your mind and a lot of feelings. 

01:53:55
MICHELLE Oh yeah, it was a lot. I couldn't dream that much in one night. 

01:54:00
STEPHEN LANKTON All right so, is it still in the seat here. 

01:54:05
MICHELLE No. 

01:54:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Just going on, but your not thinking about it. 

01:54:05
MICHELLE No, I'm not. 

01:54:05
STEPHEN LANKTON But it's still going on in the back of your mind isn't it. 

01:54:10
MICHELLE You know, like when you wake up and you try to remember a dream, it's gone, you know. Sometimes you can get pieces of it. I was actually still trying to keep up with myself was kind of hard. 

01:54:20
STEPHEN LANKTON You uh, you don't um, actually remember what, already what you were thinking? 

01:54:25
MICHELLE Some of it, yeah. I mean 

01:54:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh-huh. Do you know how much time you had your eyes closed for? 

01:54:30
MICHELLE No, I have no idea. 

01:54:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Take a guess. 

01:54:35
MICHELLE 10, 15 minutes. 

01:54:35
STEPHEN LANKTON 10, 15 um, I think it was um, about 25 maybe. 

01:54:40
MICHELLE Oh, okay. 

01:54:45
JON CARLSON She seemed to be really surprised at how long she was in a trance. 

01:54:50
STEPHEN LANKTON And surprised at how much she uh, wasn't remembering that she knew also happened. I, I think that um, you know, given a person that's, that's inclined to not ask for help and uh, avoidant of ask, having a dependency relationship it would be convenient for her to it's over and it's over. So, my suggestions here were to keep focusing on the fact that there's a lot of activity in the back of her mind. It wasn't over yet, so, she is um, social definition here says, no you're still growing, you still, you're still learning, you're still getting something. And that's okay. And then of course, you see her eye movements are all around and she, and her comments are I'm trying, I can't keep up with my self. 

01:55:35
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm. 

01:55:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh, she's, her own recognition in that there's a huge amount of processing still going on that she hasn't uh, uh, learned from yet. Learned from herself. It's beautiful because it means that uh, this was called self-hypnosis. Her realizing that they're still things she working on in the back of her mind. Uh, it really leaves her empowered with some anonymity to keep both growing on her own. There's also the uh, the time distortion and amnesia elements from uh, hypnotic standpoint. The longer a person stays in trance the greater the likelihood that they'll develop deeper and deeper extended experiences in time distortion as she did. Reducing it to about half. And uh, and a lot of amnesia, I don't think she remembers much of what I said in the looks of uh, of uh, her reaction to this. So, she had no understanding, crying for example until I mentioned it. So, she was having a lot of amnesia that uh, uh, we know especially for those areas that she has dependency. 

01:56:35
JON CARLSON So, it looks like there really were some things that were going on that she will take into the future. 

01:56:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Absolutely. 

01:56:45
