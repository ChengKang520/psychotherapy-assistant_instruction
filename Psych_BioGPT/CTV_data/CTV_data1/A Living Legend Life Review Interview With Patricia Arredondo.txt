UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA & SCOTT SEIFREIT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA 

00:00:00
  In this particular video, we have an opportunity to meet up close and personal with Dr. Patricia Arredondo. Dr. Patricia Arredondo is a well known counselor and psychologist who's recognized by her peers as a living legend in her field. In this particular tape she would share with us part of her personal upbringing, the type of mentoring that led her into pursuing counseling and psychology, and she will also share with us some of her basic ideas about her personal identity, developmental model and her multicultural, okay, conceptualization. So welcome to Dr. Patricia Arredondo's video. 

00:01:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well you asked me to talk a little bit about, uhm, ah, how I got into this and you know that I'll, I'll operate you into some of the professional work and in, one of the, ah, inspirations for me to come into the field of counseling was actually having worked with, ah, a couple of counselors, one in middle school and one in high school who were great, ah, mentors. I guess is the best word to call them and, ah, they were, uhm, you know both, ah, Caucasian people you know and, and when I was growing up I had grow up in Ohio, Northern Ohio. Ah, you know you'd, I'd, I actually, throughout my whole, ah, high school, undergraduates, graduate and, and most of my, uhm, doctoral program did not have any, ah, people of color as my professors or teachers, uhm, and you know I have these classmates. Ah, I have very few women actually in higher education unless they taught English. Uhm, but, uhm, very, very few women in, in the high school I had English teachers but, ah, it wasn't until I, in my whole masters program I had no women faculty, no women... (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
 Hmm. 

00:02:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...professors. Ah, and finally when I got to my doctoral program, uhm, I had two, uhm, women on the faculty. Uhm, as I was saying, so, you know it's a very interesting, uhm, a way of, of exposure to models and, and mentors, ah, but I was interested in, uhm, issue of culture and cultural differences go back, going back to my you know formative years because I grew up in what's, what I considered to be an immigrant city which was outside of Cleveland, Ohio and actually everybody who came to uhm, live there in the, you know, early twenties and thirties came from eastern European countries because there was a lot of, ah, industry there. We were up by the great lakes so you had the steel mill, you had, ah, the shipyards, you had all really heavy labor industry and so that brought a lot of men to, to work there and some of the men, ah, came a single man and, and you know, met their, their ah, wives there just like my father did and then others came with you know, intact families or as children with their parents and then stayed in that community. So, it was an immigrant community and that for, I always considered it immigrant community because all of the churches, ah, had their, ah, denomination and their nationality. So, we went to a Catholic church, uhm, it was a Slovenian Catholic church, I'm not Slovenian... (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...but, ah, we went to a Slovenian Catholic school, uhm, and across the street was a Hungarian Reformed Church which was, ah, you know, ah, a Protestant church. So the whole city was very much, ah, defined by ethnic uhm, enclaves, ah, and over time, people started moving around as, as if, you know, uhm, generations change and industry change. Uhm, but we were, ah, a Mexican-American by heritage and so we were the only Mexican family in this one Catholic school, ah, in the neighborhood. And you know, I always credit my mother for, ah, well, both parents but my mother wanted us to go to a school where she thought we would succeed. And I think her own experiences, ah, going to school and feeling marginalized, ah, she, she finished Ninth grade and, and there were socio-economic problems so she had to quit school and, and work. Ah, but I think she also knew that there was discrimination that occurred and then I saw a lot of her own personal experiences, uhm, were then would motivated her to, in a way protect us and get us what she thought would be a better education, so we went to Catholic school. And, ah, in many ways that was, ah, ah, an opportunity to, ah, be a good student because the nuns really made sure you were a good a student, if any of you went to Catholic school. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know what I'm talking about and so, you know, my whole milieu was growing up with, with, uhm, ah, children or going to school with other children who were you know, with this Eastern European background and then that progressed over time as I went to, uhm, middle school and high school, ah, that were public schools, so you know the, actually the, ah, more multiculturalism was presented to me as I went into those other educational sectors. So I was always aware of cultural differences growing up, uhm, and I was aware of cultural differences as it related to, ah, I guess people who were in the school as teachers, as administrators, ah, the elected officials and I, I, just, I mean, just for whatever reason it caught my attention early on. Ah, and my father was an immigrant and I used to think about the fact that he didn't go, go back to Mexico for many years, I mean, he would go, uhm, I remember he went like in 1956 or '57, I went with him on that trip, that was my first trip to Mexico. But when his father died, he was in the States and he didn't go back. He didn't have the chance to go back, I mean, finances and all that. But I used to think about that, how do immigrants really, uhm, manage to, uhm, you know, stay away and, you know, survive, you know, your whole separation from family and, and very frankly, that inspired a lot of my work on, on immigrants. Ah, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes but my early, uhm, ah, attempts to understand this separation from family and you know, the struggles and, and how people tried to, you know, make it in this new land, uhm, where, where they were still, ah, oftentimes marginalized. So, that, that's really how, that fueled my interest plus, uhm, you know, both of my, you know I come from a working class family so, also looking at the opportunities, uhm, that, uhm, I didn't think I had, and that's where my counselor really made a big difference because, uhm, I'm obviously wasn't dumb. (laughs) You know, otherwise I wouldn't have gone on to school and I was a good student. But you still needed, if you don't have family whose been in, in college before, you know, the expectations that you go to college isn't necessarily there. And so my mother would be, would've been happy if I had become a secretary which was really the norm in those days, you know, you, you become a secretary. If you go to college you become a teacher or nurse. Those were the sort of the major career paths. Uhm, but, ah, again, thanks to, uhm, my counselor and my parents for fortunately uhm, open-minded enough to, ah, understand that college was something I should do. So I was the first one from my whole family, both sides of the family to go to college. Ah, and I'm, I've come from a family of seven children, so I was the second oldest. I am not, was, I am the second oldest, (laughs) so what's (inaudible ) still I don't have (laughs) and, ah, and so subsequently, everyone else went to college. Ah, so there are ways that you begin to open the pathway to your own, in, within your own family and, ah, and that's been, you know, great success stories. So I've, and so with ah, all the kids in the family, I have no children of my own, but all our nieces and nephews, I mean, there is obviously total expectations that they're all going to college. I mean, that's not even, you know, talked, talked about otherwise, you know, that's everything is conditioned for that. Uhm, but I have the opportunity to go on and, and, uhm, I majored in Spanish and Journalism and, ah, I didn't know, well I knew in high school I like to write and I really found out that I, I do like to write. And certainly, that's an advantage if you go to a doctoral program... (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Or you do what I do I now. Ah, and so, I have this pension for journalistic typewriting. Ah, and if any of you get the, ah, Counseling Today, you know I have a monthly column in there with Michael D'Andrea that we've had for almost ten years, I mean, yeah, I think our first column came out in '94. Uhm, but as you know, that one, it's not, it's not considered academic writing, you know. Uhm, in fact, they want us to use any references. They just want you to commend and you know, give your point of view. But that's what I studied and, ah, and then I, I got my, uhm, masters and, ah, primarily school counseling, so those of you who are school counselors, I've worked as a school counselor, ah, in Boston and I got my masters at Boston College and had the opportunity to be the high school teacher and then a, a counselor. And it was again when I was a counselor that my, uhm, re, I guess I would say my interest in working with immigrants and immigrant families was refueled. Uhm, I was a, a high school counselor and, ah, at that time, this was like 1975, ah, we had a lot of refugees from Vietnam who were being resettled in the Boston area and we had also refugees from, ah, Russia, to se, with the city of Russia to Soviet Union. So these were Russian Jews who were being, ah, settled. They had the opportunity to leave the Soviet Union and some of them went to, uhm, Israel, ah, and then came into the U.S. Some went to Italy and then came into the U.S. or other parts. So we had two significant new populations that settled in, in our, all right, and, ah, Brooklyn, Massachusetts, which is right next to Boston. And, uhm, and I was ah, ah, the counselor there, one of the counselors there, we had a very big school, about two thousand or plus of the high school. For us that was big and, uhm, so I volunteered to more or less be the coordinator of all the immigrant students who were coming into the high school, who were at the high school. Because if we parceled them out the way the school was organized, yet, they would get uneven attention and they were all facing some of the similar issues of, of ah, trying to fit in, trying to manage the language, social relationships, uhm, and that was actually my first, ah, experience doing an organizational intervention. Ah, I, I didn't know at the time that's what we would call it. Uhm, but what I realized was that there were particular needs the students had. There were particular needs the teachers had about how to work with these students. And then from the social service side of it, there were agencies that were trying to work with these children and families and we needed to have a bridge to that. So the short long of it is, I, I began to develop a mechanism for pulling all of this together so that students could in fact have a successful, ah, high school experiences. It's very hard to come into high school from another country and that's, that's one of the toughest times to move in, you know, your social life is totally upset, ah, you know your, your language is different most, most cases. Ah, we found that you couldn't read the same transcripts, the transcripts just didn't translate the same. (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, ah, the students were used to different types of learning, you know, when you talk about learning styles. You know, they were used to lectures, you know you sit in the classroom and you take notes and the teacher's the authority. And now, they found themselves in, in classrooms where the teacher wanted to have discussion (laughs) or they did small group work. And so, ah, they just weren't used to it and that was the norms, so we had to work with the teachers to make sure that they knew how to create a climate so that these students felt included. Ah, so those who are all, you know, there're a lot of details to this and maybe some of you are, are ready in schools here as teachers and then counselors where you have students who come in speaking English as a second language or, again, from another part, even from another part of the country who do what we call a secondary migration. And, and that's a very hard adjustment to make. So I did that, uhm, well and, ah, I was working on my, uhm, my doctorate and, ah, so my interest actually in, in this immigrant student population led me to do my doctoral research on immigrant adolescent development. And so, I looked at, uhm, areas of identity development, that's actually my favorite focus, (laughs) identity development. And, ah, we also did, ah, moral development because that's what my professor was into and ego development. Uhm, and that led to, ah, a longitudinal study for me to really try to understand the development of these kids over time and, uhm, and follow them into college because we were really gearing to make sure these students were successful even though they were new comers. And so, it also got me interested in looking at some of the psychological consequences of immigration and, uhm, you may not have this article, Carlos, 'cause it's very old. Uhm, it came out in 1981, uhm, Personal Loss and Grief as a result of immigration. And in that article, I talked about different stages: ah, pre-migration, migration specific, and post-migration. And all of the, ah, plans, and, and emotions that course, that, that occurred during those different phases and then I talked about the post-migration phase as being the most when you would see people in counseling in schools, you know, and the, the whole, all the phases of, of culture shock, uhm, and, uhm, I also paramounted(ph) to the, uhm, Kubler-Ross Model of Loss and Grief, you know, when you, and looking at the homeland as your loss, you know, your loss of homeland and whatever that represents, you know, your friends, your family, what's familiar to you, uhm, and how that can have, ah, you know, a long term effect or for many people, it just takes a period of time to get over it, ah, or worked through it. And, and as I said, looking back on my father and other people that I knew were immigrants, uhm, I was, ah, ah, ah, always struggling to make sense of how people could that and, and what that, you know, what kind of, ah, coping mechanisms you could use once you were here, what kinds of defense mechanism. This is where, is where the psychology part also comes in you know. Uhm, what is the resilience? What keeps people going, you know, when you're miles and miles away from home? And, you know, I thought of these people from Vietnam, you know, the ones from Russia and you know, many of them really just didn't have, could never conceptualize going back because of what had happened in their countries, ah, and all of the, ah, issues on being a survivor when many of your family members were killed. Uhm, and then in the '80s I, I worked in Boston with a lot of Central Americans, ah, 80s and early 90s and there, we were having a lot of people, ah, who were also refugees from the war in Cen, wars in Central America. And if any, have you, any of you seen the movie "El Norte?" Okay, and, ah, what struck you about that movie? 

00:17:25
 I actually saw it in high school. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. 

00:17:30
 So I remember bits and pieces but I really wouldn't be able to comment a lot really on it. (laughs) 

00:17:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. But again, it's a story of two children who had to flee at night from their village because they saw everyone get killed. 

00:17:45
 Hmm. 

00:17:45
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And, ah, and their journey as children, El Norte, to the North, so they could go in to California, but all the struggles, you know, and, ah, all the trauma of, of having to leave under those conditions. And nowadays, ah, we still have a lot of people who are trying to come into the United States and, and often in, ah, what we call undocumented ways or, you know, what the press will say illegal ways, other than Arizona. So, ah, I think we had about 50 deaths already this year from people trying to come in through, ah, the desert. And you know, they, they pay someone to bring them and then often times they're abandoned, uhm, and crossing the desert I, I, you know, is just it, it gets very hot in Arizona, and we have 120 degrees this summer. And that's in the city, we had that in Phoenix. I think it got up to 120, I wasn't there that day, uhm, but if you can imagine crossing the desert and, ah, not having the water to do that or enough water to do that and just not being prepared for that kind of journey. So, and those people who did make it in, again, there's a lot of, uhm, uhm, residue of that trauma that goes with them so, you know, those all become presenting issues in counseling here. And so, if you're working with immigrant children, adolescents, families, uhm, these, these particular models help you conceptualize uhm, what some of the issues might be about, so you have to put it in context. It's not just the here and now, it's a historical piece. And in fact, the model that's right in front of you there, uhm, that little, uhm, that one there. 

00:19:30
 Yes. 

00:19:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-huh. That, uhm, I developed that, uhm, out of my work thinking about immigrants. Uhm, and as I said, I was very interested in identity issues for, for these immigrant adolescents I was working with and try to figure out, you know, when do you become bicultural, you know. Do you, uhm, uhm, give up who you are or, or you know, it's, it's really hard to do that and I believe to give up who you are. And what I also found working with immigrants and families is that people only categorize them in a very limited way because they were immigrants. 

00:20:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO So if you're an immigrant, what do people normally associate with, with that? Anybody? 

00:20:20
 Language Barriers. 

00:20:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Language Barriers, what else? 

00:20:25
 Poverty. 

00:20:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Poverty, uh hmm. What else? 

00:20:25
  Disease. 

00:20:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Disease, okay. 

00:20:30
 A sense of being less worldly, you know. 

00:20:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-huh, okay less worldly. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
 Negative(ph) 

00:20:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, okay, all right so those are all words that you can hear are very deficiency-oriented words. 

00:20:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And in fact, ah, when I worked in the schools and would hear that, you know, it used to really bother me because, you know, these were children and families who really had a life before they came here (laughs) Ah, some of them, ah, especially from the Soviet Union, they were educated people, the parents were educated. Ah, from some of the other countries, they all worked before they came here, so it, and you know, economics really drives a lot of immigration today, but I wanted, uhm, to demonstrate that we needed to look at immigrants in a more holistic way. So I developed some model that you have in front of you. And one of the cornerstones for the model was the historical piece of it and the historical moments. And, and I, I rather just elaborate a minute on this because I looked at the his, ah, immigration as a historical moment. 

00:21:40
 Hmm. 

00:21:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And as a result of immigration, a lot in someone's life changes. Uhm, we can look at 9/11 as being a historical moment in this country. And for many of us, things changed as a result of that, you know, our sense of security, our sense of safety, ah, our sense of confidence, uhm, for many people, racial profiling has been a real problem, increased problem as a result of 9/11. Uhm, another historical moment is looking at the United States, two others come to mind which(ph) are the depression and you know, we didn't live through it but you know, our parents and our grandparents, that had an effect on, on their life. Uhm, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a historical moment because it said that you can't discriminate against people in education, in housing, and employment based on racial background, religion and so forth. So, you know, my conceptualization was that immigration is a, ah, a historical moment. And when I put this model together, I still wanted to ensure that we knew that there were a lot of dimensions to people, not just their language, not just their ethnicity. So, the "A" model as you can see, identifies a lot of what are, are called social identities and we have our demographics about people. And, ah, my little hypothesis, uhm, is and continues to be that the "A" Dimensions and the "C" influence the "B," okay, that the "A" and "C" influence the "B." So my opportunities for higher education, uhm, really come about because at the time I was born and because the Civil Rights Act had been passed and the Women's Movement of the seventies was a big deal and there was really a lot more encouragement for women to go on in higher education and, and not just to get a bachelors degree but to get a doctoral degree. Ah, and so, I had the benefit of, of that kind of legislation. Uhm, nowadays, uhm, you know my "A" Dimensions in terms of, uhm, gender and language, uhm, and age are, are really assets in the workplace. Because I can bring that, it's, you know all of that now gives me more credentials, more credibility than I had twenty years ago, uhm, to bear on, on the work I do and whatever I, you look at here and the work experience is in the "B" Dimensions and what gets valued. So, uhm, the model really is designed to show us that the "A" Dimensions, we all have. Most of these were born with, we can't change, okay. A number of these are fixed by legis, are, are protected by legislation and, uhm, the "B" Dimensions, we have a little bit more flexibility to, uhm, to perhaps make choices about those, they may represent developmental opportunities for us, uhm, and, uhm, there's probably more you could add to this. It's just a template for, for trying to, ah, have us expand our thinking about how we, uhm, look at ourselves, uhm, number one, ah, as I said, I started this with immigrants. And, and for me, just because this is a not, and, and this is a multicultural counseling course, so you're looking at issues on stage models, you've probably looked up why(ph) the identity development (inaudible ) and so forth. This is not a stage model. Uhm, so it's a different way of, of looking at where people are in their life, ah, and maybe why they are where they are without categorizing them in a stage model, I mean, I, the stage models are there and they have their purpose, uhm, but I, you know, I, I, like what I've got here (laughs) ah, because I just think it just gives a snapshot and I, sort of a real quick autobiographical or biographical snapshot of, of, of a person. And, you know, for some of you, the "A" Dimensions, there's certain "A" Dimensions that are more important. Ah, there's certain "B" Dimensions that are more important. You all have historical moments that have been influenced you in your life, some of them out of your control, most, most historical moments are out of our control. Although, another, you know, we really could say some that are under your control, let's say you would get married, you have children, I mean, those are all historical and monumental in your life and those will affect some of your "B" Dimensions. But you have others that we don't control, the wars are always are out of control. Uhm, natio, ah, natural disasters, things like that, uhm. So you can also tie this into worldview that our worldview, uhm, you know, how we relate to people, how we, you know, uhm, relate to authority, uhm, how we manage our time in our activity, might all be a result of one of these major historical moments. So, those are things that don't necessarily appear on here but you know, you could see why, ah, someone who has in fact, uhm, been in the war, been ah, as, uhm, a part of the war, ah, actively part, will have a different worldview than someone who's never served in the military, you know. I don't know what it's like to be shot at or to, you know, to go through what these young people are going to in Iraq right now. I mean it, you know, actually I have no idea, ah, and how that affects people afterwards. Uhm, but we do know that post-traumatic stress disorder is not just one of the consequences of, of being in a war but also for a lot of people who, uhm, lived under traumatic situations on a day to day basis, you know, if you live in a neighborhood that's unsafe, uhm, you will have to fear for your life on a daily basis, I mean, that, that engenders the, not only the anxiety but potentially, ah, some, ah, PTSD symptoms. So anyway, sorry we got off the track there but this is, uhm, this I developed, uhm, in the 80's but I couldn't conceptualize it in the model until I had a colleague, Tom Klauner(ph) who kinda created the little model. Uhm, so he was supposed to win the Ernie(ph) Maxwell(ph) or something like that (laughs), I don't know, but he did not. But it said, I said it works for me you know (laughs), it just shows that all of these are interrelated and, ah, in fact all of this applies to, to many of us. But my journey in the, ah, you know, the multi, what today is called multicultural counseling competency development, uhm, started I'd say in the early 80's, and it started, uhm, in my work with the American Counseling Association and at that time, I think we were AACD, the American Association of Counseling and Development. Ah, how many of you are members of ACA? Everybody has to be a member of ACA, please (laughs). 

00:28:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:29:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Please you must. You, you do? Okay you have to join. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
 That's what it sounds like. 

00:29:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO You have to join ACA. Uhm, no, this is your professional identity, really gets reinforced when you're a member of your sort of professional association. It, it's so important, I, I can't tell you enough, because really and, and, uhm, Dr. (inaudible ) is a part, big part of, uhm, professional associations as well. I mean, when you do that, you just, ah, have the opportunity to be exposed to, ah, people and conferences and presentations and things that you wouldn't just get in your academic preparation. This kinda takes you to another level. That's one of the reasons I strongly encourage you to, to join and just from the magazine, the, the professional journals, you get the monthly newspaper and so forth, great opportunities and exposure. However, coming back to that, uhm, I, uhm, I got pushed into joining ACA when I was in graduate school which I always thank my advisor for doing and then I joined APA, American Psychological Association, when I completed my doctorate. Uhm, so I belong to boths and I'm active in both. Ah, but the ACA piece of it was important to me. I was, ah, a member of what's called still the Association for Counselor Educators and Supervisors, and the membership, uhm, are people like ourselves who are faculty and other people who are administrators of guidance programs in your public school systems. Those are mostly, uhm, who, who, who are members there. Uhm, and, ah, you know, it was obvious to me in my graduate training that we didn't focus on culture very much, ah, at all. I mean I never had a multicultural counseling course when I was in, ah, in my graduate training. Uhm, and you might worked with clients who were, ah, of ethnic minority backgrounds but that rarely really got talked about. Uhm, you know, in an academic way, you know, you would just notice all the student's Black or you know, the student speaks English as a second language, but it wasn't like, get out there there's more to it you know, other than that. So, uhm, in the association I was, uhm, ah, became a member of what was called then the Human Rights Committee. And the Human Rights Committee, ah, what we've started to do in the Human Rights Committee, there were about five or six of us who really kinda pulled together and they're all at other institutions now, so I'm, these people could've continued their mission on, uhm, multicultural issues. Uhm, what we did was develop I think one of the first training manuals that looked at, uhm, uhm, what are considered today some of the major diversity groups, uhm, based on gender differences. 

00:31:55
 Hmm. 

00:31:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO So we started the Human Rights Committee to try and address multicultural issues. And our first training manual talked about women's issues, issues for ethnic minorities, people for gay, gay and lesbian, disabled, I mean it was, and when I look back at that this was like 1983, I was like, we were a little ahead of the curve or we were so ahead of the curve that when we would have workshops, people often didn't come (laughs). So, I can think of conferences where you know, we had this wonderful you know set up, all of us were there and no one came to our, our, our, our workshop, (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
 (inaudible ).

DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO you know, these multinational conferences. But we didn't give up because we really believed in what we were doing. So, the human rights that sort of started translating into cross-cultural counseling and today what we call multicultural counseling but I was really aware at that time that we needed to have some guidelines for addressing cultural differences, you know, that we all bring cultural differences, uhm, to school, to counseling, uhm, and so much was focused on just the client, you know, ah, a kinda the textbook. I mean the cookbook approach, you know. Tell me how to work with, you know, this teenage mother, ah, who is Latina or how may it work with this, you know, poor White women who's got, you know, no resources and, but, but it was like a very limited how do I fix them rather than you know what do I bring to the picture? And, ah, so, uhm, in, uhm, I guess it was in '82 that I, I, actually in '81, I was, I had an article on talking about competency development, ah, in, in counselor(ph) education and that was followed and, and I didn't, I don't know if I knew Derald at that time, I think we had met Derald Wing Sue. And, ah, Derald Wing Sue then came out in '82 with, uhm, the first ten what were then called cross-cultural competencies, and that was for Division 17 of APA. Sorry, I'm just kinda giving you a little history. And those competencies really never went anywhere. They were published, uhm, in the, uhm, Counseling Psych Journal but the association never got behind them. And then in, uhm, the early 90's, uhm, through the Association of Multicultural Counseling and Development, Thomas Parham who was a president at that time, uhm, asked Derald, Rob McDavis, and myself to re-look at these competencies and see if we could come out with something else. So we then drafted what you'd probably known now as this '92, 1992 document, Multicultural Counseling Competencies: A Call to the Profession. And, uhm, you know, it became one of the most, it's probably one of the most quoted or cited, I should say cited articles, ah, in the multicultural literature. And, and then ah, there was still, ah, a question about implementation, people said to us, you know. Well, these are nice, you know, these are great statements, but how do you become multiculturally competent? What are some of the, ah, approaches or behaviors? Uhm, so I chaired the, the task force that then came out with the 1996 document Operationally, Operationalization of the Multicultural Counseling Competencies. And that has actually been a template for other organizations to adapt those competencies for, let's say, school counseling, group counseling, marriage and family counseling. Uhm, some, someone last week told me, they're, they're gonna see how they could use those in higher education, you know, training superintendents and people like that. So, the thing with those competencies is they, they're designed to be guidelines, more than anything, you know. This is, this is good, these are good practices, uhm, and that we all need to acquire the education and experience to help us become multiculturally competent. Now, I don't think it's an end point. I just think it's developmental process. So, we're always in the, in the process of becoming multiculturally competent. So, my work continues to, uhm, to be on the academic side. And as you've met Dr. D'Andrea, ah(ph), uhm, and he probably told you of our, our work together with the National MultiCultural Institute, and the work that we started back in the early 90's, and now we're beginning to see some of the results of that. Ah, and this is why of all these changed processes take time. Uhm, I never, you know, when we wrote the competencies in '92, uhm, I had no idea, ah, if we would ever go beyond, you know, getting them in one of the journals. I mean, really we never thought that would happen. And, you know, it took ten years but the American Counseling Association endorsed the competencies. That's a big deal. Okay, because they are now parallel with the ethical standards and we're saying, you know, you, if you're going to practice ethically, you also have to be multiculturally competent, in order to provide culturally responsive services. So, I mean, I've seen that in my lifetime at least. Uhm, then as a result of our work, uhm, we planned a number of strategies. Did Michael tell you all these things? If, if, you can interrupt me at anytime. 

00:37:30
  Well, what about the strategies? 

00:37:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. One of the strategies was to, uhm, try to support people to move into leadership roles in the American Counseling Association, who supported, you know, multicultural principles. So, we did several things. We would advise the ACA president on what he or she ought to be thinking about, ah, for their, uhm, agenda. Ah, we identified people who we encouraged to run for office in, in ACA. We were, uhm, the group that helped to start the Counselors for Social Justice. Uhm, that got formally approved, I think in the, uhm, about four years ago. We supported the Association of Gay and Lesbian, uhm, bisexuals to become a full division, because prior to that they have been a, like a, committee or an affiliate for almost twenty years. Ah, so we helped them get a full status. Uhm, we have a monthly column in the, uhm, as I've mentioned to you, in the ACA newsletter, (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
 Okay(ph). 

00:38:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO co-promoting dignity and development through diversity. And, and we have done other things with colleagues in other divisions, in order to, uhm, you know, make this an inclusive process, you know it's, it's a process that affects all of us, multicultural competency is about all of this. And so, we partner, ah, with people in Counselor Education in particular because that's where a lot of this happens. This is where a lot of the, you know, the crux of it begins is in how you're, you're taught, you know, that, I, you know, I believe personally that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
 Hmm. 

00:39:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...multicultural competencies have to be addressed in all your courses, not just in this course. Ah, and it becomes very important, obviously, in the internship and practicum because that's where the rubber(ph) meets the road where you're going... (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
 Yeah. 

00:39:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...to be working with people. And being able to look at their A and B and C dimensions, and see how those, you know, those contribute to some of the, the stress they might be going through, to try to understand it anyway. So, we have been active, uhm, doing uhm, those things and then, and with the American Psychological Association, uhm, it's not as, as though I don't have enough to do, (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
 Hmm. 

00:39:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO (coughs) but when I moved into Arizona State University four years ago, I've, I've only been there, uhm, four years. Uhm, I was, ah, encouraged to, uhm, to become more active in APA... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
 Okay. 

00:40:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...and, uhm, so I was elected President of, of Division, Division 45, which is the Society for the Study of Ethnic Minority Issues. (coughs) And it parallels the AMCD and ACA. Uhm, and our division in APA, again we have student affiliates as well? You're welcome to join, uhm, our student affiliate group in APA. Uhm, and, and that division, uhm, again, it's ah, really promotes, we promote a lot of the (coughs) education side in Psychology. Uhm, in Psychology, uhm, edu, training and research, are the two big areas that we focus on and practice, obviously. So, uhm, with Derald, uhm, then, ah, wanted us to do or suggest it is, to try to get the competencies into APA. Okay. Have APA also, buy into these competencies because APA in many ways is, ah, because of its scientific research rigor, you know, they think that everything can, you know, there's some people who think that, you know, well, you know, we measure it so, what we find is what we measure. Ah, and so that, you know, with culture, well, you know, (inaudible ) yeah, we, ah, we recognize culture but they didn't, they wouldn't talk about measuring it. They would only measure it in terms of how many Blacks they have in a group, how many Latinos and, and then they would explain their differences based on those large cohorts, which, you know, we know within, although within group differences for any one person so, you know. Uhm, so, ah, within APA, uhm, I worked about three, almost yeah, close to four years, with ah, a colleague, uhm, Nadya Fouad from the University of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee. Nadya and I are co-authors of a writing team that, uhm, developed what are called Multicultural Guidelines for the American Psych Association. And, uhm, those guidelines were formally approved in 2002. Now, if I, if somebody told me we're gonna make that happen in, in the American Psychological Association, I mean, I really, at times when I got involved with this, I said, this is really like ludicrous, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
 Uh hmm(ph). 

00:42:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO APA is so rigid, and APA this and APA. Well, you know, my commitment to this is really what kept me in it, uhm, because I believe it was important for the association and, uhm, we had so many check points in that writing process. Ah, we had to meet with the legal counsel of APA, because in, in the American Psych Association, you cannot have competencies because there's legal implications as you, you use that term. You can only have guidelines. It's much more structured than the ACA, uhm, organization. But I learned a lot ah, what we also did as a result of taking the approach we did with APA is got(ph) buying(ph) because their process, ah, cost(ph) us to write about four drafts of this document before it became finally approved. And in, in, in writing the various drafts, everybody has to give feedback. Now, APA has 52 divisions, okay? So you have to circulate this manuscript to all 52 divisions, to all APA boards and committees and to State associations. 

00:43:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  And it's a very, very, I don't know if the Federal Government is that complicated but I'll tell you. This really was a, a, a huge process, and you know when I, I knew pretty early on that, that was gonna happen and I said to Nadya, I don't know, I said this, "Are, are, are we ever gonna get this done?" But, uhm, fortunately there was a lot of support and people gave us feedback. We've responded to the feedback. We've circulated again till we got to a point where people said, you know, this is just about done. And we, we met in Washington, I think it was, uhm, where ah, it'll(ph) be, it was 2002, March 2002, ah, with representatives from the main APA boards and kinda did the final, "Okay, change this. Bring these references in," you know, 'coz they wanted a very scholarly publication. Uhm, and we finished it, uhm, and it went to what their governing body is in APA is called the Council of Representatives. And, uhm, they unanimous, unanimously approved it in the summer of 2002. It's been published in the American Psychologist. It's a big deal, then. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
 And not the last issue by the one before (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:45:01
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO It was, yeah, it was published in the May issue, I think, of, of, of, of the ah, (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
 (inaudible ) 

00:45:06
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO American Psychologist. I mean, that's monumental, I can't tell you, it's, you know, this word, it's like, I don't wanna say about(ph) anything about the American Psychiatric Association but I mean if something like that, hey, it's almost like as big a deal as if it happened there. Uhm, so uhm, now, my big, ah, our big task, my big task and, uhm, I guess, is to, uhm, work on implementation of the guidelines and try to help people implement these six guidelines. My big area of interest is organizational development. Uhm, I left teaching ah, in Boston to ah, set up an organizational consulting company and ran that for 15 years. And ah, you know, found that my counseling skills uhm, my teaching skills and, you know, my sort of intuitive sense for looking at systems, ah, were really important assets. So, all my work there was, uhm, focused on helping organizations who wanted to, ah, the, address workforce diversity. And become more diverse themselves, ah, change the climate of their organizations so that they would be, the climate would be more receptive and they would hold on to ah, people of color, or women, that women would get promoted, that there would be, you know, a safe environment for gays and lesbian and so forth, so that my consulting for 15 years before I went to ASU, was in this area. And I'd still consult to, part, particularly universities, uhm, who all want to create a climate that's more inclusive.
