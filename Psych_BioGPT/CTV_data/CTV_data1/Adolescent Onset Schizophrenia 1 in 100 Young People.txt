WINNIE KING Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental illness, and it's mostly likely to strike doing our lessons find now what you can do about it right now on keeping kids healthy. 

00:01:10
Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:15
WINNIE KING , MD Hi, I'm Dr. Winnie King and I'm coming to you right from the lobby of children's hospital at Mount of Fur in New York city, so you may hear some noise in the background. You know Schizophrenia is one of the most miss-understood mental illness there is. People as to think it has to do with the split personality, but that's not the case at all what it really is brain disorder. Affecting as many as one person in every one hundred stores a person's perception of what going on around them. They may see or hear things that aren't there or believe things that aren't true and overtime it can interferer with their ability to think clearly or to hold on to a train of though or even make decisions about how to make their daily lives. It's a truly tragic disease that made even worst by the fact that it's most likely to strike a just when the child is reached his mid or late teens or sometimes their early twenties and when it does strike it changes the close of his life. In a previous episode of Keeping Kids Healthy we should you what happens in the rarer situation when Schizophrenia hits a young child in that show about a boy name Parker his parents told us much of his story from the outside. Today we're going to meet a young man barely out of his teens who will be our tour guide from inside Hues' story. 

00:02:35
JASPER I knew something wasn't right when I would be all about myself somewhere hearing things, hearing people's voices. 

00:02:50
NARRATOR This is Jasper he is 22 year old a former model and art student a very soft spoken and gentle young man. To all outward appearances completely normal, when you meet him you could never imagine the challenges he's been facing in his life. Not right at the beginning of course the early days were wonderful. 

00:03:10
ALISON Jasper's Parents He was delightful, he was gorgeous as he is now, he was very social, always very bright. He had an independent balance and a very kind of sly raise of sense of humor. 

00:03:25
JIM BUNN But then when he turned to 15, the voices began. 

00:03:30
JASPER Voices in head, voice is the sound that's coming from somewhere else but it was hard because I couldn't really understand what they were saying. He was sort of like, muffled, like if you are talking to someone and then growing to a tunnel, so that I mean it was weird and then I would have hallucinations. I did (inaudible ) when I was in college but they were much clearer than any sort of drug that I could have been on. I wasn't really scared by the voices I was scared of the hallucinations I would have, because I would see sometimes see faces like in windows like that would freak me out, shadows freak me out. So yeah I got scared it was pretty creepy. I would hear a conversation for as little as 30 seconds, or as long as five minutes or I would see shadows passing me or walking in front of me, mostly I saw myself and for the most part it was sort of me doing violent things, violent disruptive things. When you're hallucinating sometimes you're in it or sometimes you're watching it. I mean hallucinating, I was sitting in the chair and I could see myself sitting in another chair and I was facing myself. So I was, there were two of myself and one of them jumped over to the other one and snapped his neck. 

00:05:40
NARRATOR While Jasper suspected for years that something was not quiet right, he didn't tell any one until a year ago when a hallucinations began happening almost daily. It was then on a road trip in summer house in Maine that Jasper finally told his mother something was wrong. 

00:05:55
ALISON We were driving along and Jasper said, he told me that he heard a voice and I was driving, I almost drove off the road. 

00:06:10
NARRATOR Jasper's parents had sense for a while that their son was going through some inner turmoil. But so many parents on teens, they blamed on the changes of adolescence, they never suspected ultimate diagnosis, Schizophrenia. A physically based brain disorder that creates sever disturbances in thinking and perception, a break with reality, the diagnosis would change their lives. 

00:06:35
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN , MD Lieber Center for Schizophrenic Research The specific symptoms that characterizes this break with reality are false perceptions, seeing hearing, feeling, smelling thinks that aren't there, then secondly false thoughts or believes or illusions, thinking things real that aren't real and not being able to talk out of it or convince by reason that this not the case. And then the third kind of positive symptoms is disorganization of thinking, experiencing difficulties in normal cognitive functions, paying attention to the things, being able to remember things, being able to complex abstract judgments about things, executive decisions about how to get through daily life. 

00:07:20
JUDITH RAPOPORT , MD Chief, Child Psychiartry Branch, NIMH They have illusionations, dilution which would be positive symptoms they withdraw from social interaction and lose interest in activity and interacting so called negative symptoms. 

00:07:35
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN So for example loss of emotionality instead of enthusiastic, about things somebody is really vacant barren of emotions neutral. With added lessons to earlier dealt onsets Schizophrenia the tragedy the part has to do with these people are just coming into the prime of their life and they have their own life to peruse with hopes and aspirations and dreams as well as those with their families. And then, all of a sudden they struck down and things may never be the same again. 

00:08:10
NARRATOR The diagnosis despite its severity brought a strange sense of relief. 

00:08:15
JASPER I was mostly relieved that it was you know not that it was like a common illness but that it was a real something that had a name to it and people were studying it researching it and they had medicine to not care but to make life easier. 

00:08:40
JODY Shapiro Jasper'S Father Unfortunately we were able to find some really great you know doctors who were incredibly wonderful about helping us and listening to Jasper and being involved. 

00:08:55
NARRATOR Within a year, the medication combined with regular therapy had made an enormous difference in Jasper's life. 

00:09:00
JASPER For the most part when I wake up in the morning, I don't really say to myself you know this is another day you have to deal with it and really have to struggle. As long as I take my medicine, I … it's there is pretty much… there pretty much 100% that I won't have any reoccurring symptoms. Sometimes here and there I hear you know little whispers or someone calling on my name. 

00:09:35
NARRATOR But there were still problems like the stigma. 

00:09:40
JASPER I don't tell all that many people. I'm cautious to tell all the people because I don't want them to be afraid of me or feel wired around me, people saw this has such a evil and terrible thing. 

00:10:00
DR. ELIZABETH PAPPADOPULOS , PhD Jasper's Psychologist The stigma does not only affect the patient, it affects the whole family. It's important to help parents to work through those issues because there is a lot of shame and embarrassment about having a child like this. It's very hard for a parent to say my child has Schizophrenia. 

00:10:15
NARRATOR But with the waning of the voices in the Japser'S head there was another more surprising respons. 

00:10:20
DR. ELIZABETH PAPPADOPULOS Ones the medication started to take affect and eliminated the voices he felt lost to some degree, he felt that these voices that made him special that gave him unique and creative thoughts that helped him with the heart work were no longer available to him. 

00:10:35
NARRATOR Jasper'S art particularly his painting helps him cope with his illness. 

00:10:40
JASPER I did this last year and its rats on a train. 

00:10:50
On the art train. 

00:10:50
JASPER On the art train exactly. This is peace I've been working of for a couple of months just doing layer after layer. 

00:11:10
NARRATOR Jasper has also made a video diary. It provides an intimate glimpse into his world and his inner struggles. 

00:11:15
JASPER It is one or two, I just woke up, the reason I wake up now is that I have insomnia and I think to sleep until around 4 O' Clock Insomnia is a big part of my life, it's still can't find what I'm looking for. I'm definitely lonely. I got a girl, they can't go. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:25
JASPER Too silence to every person. 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
JASPER There's a raw side to everything, fatigue meant. 

00:12:50
[sil.] 

00:13:10
JASPER More violent dreams for Jasper. 

00:13:15
NARRATOR Shortly after this video was shot Jasper was relapsed and hospitalized that's not unusual for Schizophrenia. 

00:13:25
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN Treatment now can control symptoms, but virtually all people even if they are treated effectively and their recovered fully go on to have relapses. And as they have these relapses, they can't necessarily recover as well as they had first time in return to how they were before they were real. 

00:13:45
NARRATOR But the most critical message for the parent to understand is this. Patients can significantly reduce relapses by staying on their prescribed medication and by staying off illicit drugs which many of them used to get away from their symptoms. 

00:14:00
JASPER What makes it worst is (inaudible ) drugs, especially (inaudible ). 

00:14:08
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN If you experiment with drugs, if you takes things like Cocaine, Methinefedamine, PCP, LST, you're chances of developing it with any genetic liability are much higher because this will precipitate the illness. The best chance for recovering is from you first episode, after that all bets are off. And each time you push your luck, incurring another relapse the likelihood of your not recovering goes up. Over time there is a decline that become reversible. Jasper's case is a good example of both the possibility and also the great challenge about Schizophrenia. Here you had somebody who has had a great response in treatment but the ability to make the most of where he is now depends on his ability to comply with the need for future treatment… 

00:15:10
NARRATOR And in Jasper's case his family there to help. 

00:15:15
JASPER Everything that's happened has made me closer to my family because I saw how much they care and I mean how much they wanted to help me. So it wasn't a good thing that happened but you know something good they come out of it. 

00:15:35
WINNIE KING When you actually have a chance to see someone's story from the inside like that it really makes it easier to understand what the disease is all about, but this terrible impact that has on the Adolescent himself is only part of story as with so many illness, family members become victims too. 

00:15:55
NARRATOR They look like a perfectly happy couple. 

00:15:55
ALISON We're going to have a feast tonight. 

00:16:00
NARRATOR But the life of Bob and Salwa bare the scars of Schizophrenia. Unlike Jasper there is story of Schizophrenia is told from the outside. A story of confusion and lost dreams. The story began in January 1980 with Salwa gave birth to a son. They named him Edward. 

00:16:20
SALWA Edward's Mother Well, I had tremendously high hopes for my son. I think it's cultural, part of my culture where men are suppose to I mean achieved but I mean men is suppose to achieve higher up and above. 

00:16:35
BOB Edward's Father I didn't have any set highways as to what he should do or where he should go or what he should study I wanted him just to me a healthy, normal, well integrated responsible person in society. 

00:16:55
NARRATOR In the early years all their dreams were fulfilled. 

00:17:00
SALWA He was still loving and warm and friendly considered of other people, loved his parents, loved his sister. 

00:17:10
FIONA Edward's Sister We used to (inaudible ) alike any brother and any sister. We would just do silly things like trying to get Sunday schools, unplug my parents (inaudible ) they would like to sleep late and you know it just sort of any kid does growing up. 

00:17:25
NARRATOR He was a start athlete too. 

00:17:25
SALWA You know when he scored the winning goal at the end and the hockey rain that kids just all through themselves on him and he was just a very, very happy little boy and very popular with his pears. 

00:17:40
BOB I love to go to his games and watch him like, I told to hockey practice and encouraged because this was really something that increased his self confidence. 

00:17:55
NARRATOR But then the first problems appeared. It seemed like ADHD. 

00:18:00
SALWA We are very much on top of it, we had him on medication for ADHD. He did reasonably did well in school, he had therapy, but when he turned his late thirteen's early fourteen's something just snapped. 

00:18:20
NARRATOR They didn't know it yet but they're seeing first signs of Schizophrenia. Unlike Jasper Ed wasn't seeing things or hearing voices but he was having dilutions, he imagined himself to be a drug king pin with the maphia. He began drinking heavily experimenting with and selling drugs. 

00:18:35
FIONA It was sort of this long progression that happened over five or six years and it got progressively worst. 

00:18:45
NARRATOR But for ten years the experts didn't figure it out Ed wasn't having classic symptoms like hearing voices on one suggested Schizophrenia. 

00:18:55
SALWA We kept asking to one another what is wrong with him, is it something that we did putting blame on one another. 

00:19:05
NARRATOR Ed'S downward viral continued, he was expelled from one high school he attended. Admitted to treatment facilities he walked away. At one point he trashed his own apartment. As his parents saw Ed'S life creaming out of control the life they have dreamed for their son died. 

00:19:25
SALWA I want a (ph) death of my child all though the dreams that we had for him and also the dreams that he had for himself are gone. It's like losing a child… 

00:19:40
BOB It's a living death. There is no formality in. 

00:19:45
NARRATOR And still no one suggested Schizophrenia. In fact Bob's impression of the disease remind the same as most peoples. 

00:19:55
BOB These are people that you want to avoid, there are not people that afraid that they want to knife you or they smell and you close your eyes to the situations. 

00:20:10
NARRATOR But their eyes were about to be opened. Twenty two year old Edward told his parents he was leaving the suburban Boston home to live on his own. 

00:20:20
BOB We didn't know where he was, but we fell he was in Boston and this was just after 9/11 and I happen to… 

00:20:30
SALWA And we got some food in the city. 

00:20:30
BOB And I noticed in the hall way building some vagrant with huge nails into nails that smelled that was eating food out of a box and that was my son. 

00:20:55
NARRATOR Ed's life has hit Rock Bottom, he been living on the street for three months, but with a renewed effort of diagnosis he and his family finally received an explanation for his dilutions for his disorganization in his thinking for his loss of judgment it was Schizophrenia. Ones they knew they took the first critical step medication and reached out for the best care they could find. 

00:21:20
BOB One of the wise things that we did was to find a third party like a case manager to basically be his guardian and be responsible for it. 

00:21:40
NARRATOR (inaudible ) runs a home for people with diseases Edwards lives there he could talk comfortably with the Keats about his disease. 

00:21:45
EDWARD I started drinking to mass the pain you know self medicating. 

00:21:50
KEAT Yeah now you're recognizing your self medicating you didn't recognize it back then right. 

00:21:55
EDWARD Well, I know, I know… 

00:21:55
KEAT You know that's you were trying to do? 

00:22:00
NARRATOR Edward has been (inaudible ) for three years and now for the first time he is agreed to be interviewed the television about his disease. 

00:22:05
What did you think about Schizophrenia before it came into your life what was its impression of it. 

00:22:15
EDWARD Well I thought it was for crazy people you know talk to themselves or hear voices. 

00:22:25
And what do you think. 

00:22:25
EDWARD I didn't think I was crazy like in the Schizophrenia sense. 

00:22:30
And what do you know about it now to think about it. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
EDWARD Well I know that there is many different times of Schizophrenia and you know I've had to accept the fact that's my diagnosis. 

00:22:55
NARRATOR That acceptance was hard for Edward. 

00:22:55
EDWARD Yeah it's really unpleasing but just got to live with it. 

00:23:05
How would you do that. 

00:23:10
EDWARD You know like taking medication, going to the doctors, putting myself in the main (inaudible ) society upstanding from alcohol and drugs working, having friends, family. 

00:23:30
NARRATOR Ed supports himself as the owner of the lucrative dog walking business, his sister Fiona has a family of her own, but she stays in close with him. 

00:23:40
FIONA There is amazing difference, I mean he's completely come out of the shell and he's more interactive and he is to understand things to by itself but the world. 

00:23:50
Can you say hi to you uncle, hi, hi 

00:23:55
FIONA I do think that he gains a tremendous amount of joy out of being alive and coming as far as he has. 

00:24:05
NARRATOR Ed's parents are working to raising awareness about Schizophrenia but there is also agree that it took 10 years that Ed to be diagnosed, 10 years with earlier treatment would have left Ed's brain less damaged. 

00:24:15
SALWA I am very angry. I had to do some work on that and I think the work I'm doing in trying to help other people understand in these illness. I think it's part to manage my anger and I hope that my sons example and him coming out and talking about it will help other people. 

00:24:45
WINNIE KING So what's the end of today's story is fortunately for both Jasper and Ed there is hope. It comes from the families and the support system that surround them. 

00:24:55
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN We know now that if you treat people early, effectively you can produce good levels of response and in many cases a full recovery assuming that we can convince people to remain in treatment indefinitely. 

00:25:10
NARRATOR Edward commitment to do that is clear. 

00:25:15
SALWA He has had a lot of help but he is better because of himself because he takes his medicine because he's (inaudible ) because he's working, his life is destructed, so a huge part of his success comes from his own willingness to get better. 

00:25:30
NARRATOR The same it true for Jasper 

00:25:30
JODY SHAPIRO He want somebody grow up and you can see a path that their on and then that part gets interrupted and fortunately he found his way with wonderful professional help back to a place were he can sort of see what's real to himself. 

00:25:50
JASPER The only advise I can give is that you can't let it bring it down, you can't like be diagnosed with and say you know there is nothing I can do and this is the end of the world for me to have to get back out there and live your life 

00:26:15
ALISON Jasper is so admirable because he is trying everyday to live with it and stay away from what may cause more destruction he's healing himself, he's healing himself.
