00:00:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi, I am Lewis Schlosser, I am a Professor of Counseling Psychology at Seton Hall University. With me today is Jane Dewey. Jane is an advance doctoral student and a candidate for the Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology at Seton Hall with me. She is about to begin her clinical internship this year at the East Orange VA Hospital. One of Jane’s areas of interest and research expertise is in Christian Privilege. So, Jane, thank you so much for agreeing to be here today and talking with me about this. 

00:00:55
JANE DEWEY Thank you. I am happy be here. 

00:01:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So we are just gonna jump right in and if you could for audience sort of talk a little about what… what is Christian privilege, like what does that term mean and then we’ll (inaudible ) sort of maybe at some actual examples of it. 

00:01:11
JANE DEWEY Sure. So, we talk about privilege in general, we are talking about privilege or advantages that are granted to one group over other groups in society. When we talk about Christian privilege in particular, we are referring to the advantages that are given, bestowed upon to Christians in US society. I mean in other societies where Christians tend to dominate in terms of population and their position in or their numbers in positions of authority within the government and this ends up being creating situation where there is power on one end and not on the other end… the other end in this circumstance being non-Christians. Guess that’s kind of the… the basic definition 

00:02:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And then maybe we could talk a bit about like some examples. So, I mean you already mentioned one like so that Christians tend to be in the positions of power. 

00:02:05
JANE DEWEY Sure. 

00:02:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But always some examples of how this manifest on the day to day basis, like so how people could see a Christian privilege when it was in action. 

00:02:15
JANE DEWEY Sure. Yeah and let me say that I’m trying to think is, okay I will give you some examples and then open up it a little broader, but in your article, your 2003 article “Breaking a Sacred Taboo”, you did a… a really great job by numerating 25 or 30 examples of how this manifest in daily life. 

00:02:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER (inaudible ). 

00:02:37
JANE DEWEY Okay, good. The one’s that that really jump out to me are that as a Christian person I know that my… my calendar for work, for school will lightly reflect my religious holidays that I won’t to have to go to my boss or go to my teacher and say look this is an important holiday in my religion. I’m in need of off because that’s already going to be granted, based on the schools calendar or the works calendar. I can wear a cross or a bumper sticker on my car that says “Jesus is Lord” or something along those lines and not have to worry that my car might be vandalized or that some physical harm may come on to me or my family. Let's see. One I think, great example you also had in the article that wasn’t in the list, but was in the body of the article the… do you remember what June 10th, 2000 was? 

00:03:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Of course. 

00:03:35
JANE DEWEY What? 

00:03:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right June 10th being Jesus Day in the state of Texas. 

00:03:40
JANE DEWEY Of course in the state of Texas. Then Governor George W. Bush declared that day to be… the day to be Jesus like, in terms of service to others and calling for a day of service to others is great, but calling at Jesus Day when you are in a position of authority and there is supposedly the separation of religion and state, really is Christian privilege at its finest in terms of being really out there. I can turn on the radio at any given time and find a Christian station, can find someone talking about this being a Christian nation. So those are some of the daily sort of advantages. One other really striking example that we’ve had in recent news is the election of the first Muslim congressman. When Alison(ph) was elected, when he was… wanting… needing to be sworn in, he asked to do so on a Quran and the firestorm that erupted after that was remarkable, for this being a secular nation, as it is, as we believe it is in… in the terms of the founding fathers. 

00:04:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. Like (inaudible ) sworn in a bible. 

00:04:52
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:04:52
LEWIS SCHLOSSER He wants to be sworn in on his holy text. 

00:04:55
JANE DEWEY Right. Yeah. 

00:04:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So. So good. You had said, you had referenced, I’ll start in general and then you meet some reference. I know if there are other things you wanted to… 

00:05:00
JANE DEWEY Yeah, yeah. What was that I was going to say? 

00:05:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So when you are talking, you are thinking about things from the list from the article that were salient for you. Was there something else you wanted to talk about as in the terms of examples? 

00:05:10
JANE DEWEY There was and it was in connection with the… with your first question more and the definition room. We talked about power and it being a function of their… Christians over representation in positions of power, in authority… one important thing to think about too is that as a Christian person I can talk about these things and write about these things and not be seen as self serving for example which is I think one of the reasons that you are interviewing me today, you are the expert on Christian privilege and I am your student and I am becoming an expert on Christian privilege and an expert on privilege you know in the way that we studied that in our field, but it’s an interesting sort of thing to be here you know and us having this conversation and… and having this aspect of Christian privilege prevalent or present. 

00:06:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, because we’ve talked about our previous joint presentations about who do people listen to and why do they listen to them and why does a Christian person actually have more face fluidity(ph) ironically if you will to talk about Christian privilege than a Jewish person, because the Jewish persons tends to understand it better because they haven’t had it because in general when you don't have privilege it’s often easier to sort of point it out in the privileged person, but in the case when you are a Christian person, then you are sort of like, well, “If Jane is talking about this like you know, it’s… it’s not going to benefit her to working, to work to dismantle it. So now I have to… now I am… and why in the world she is talking about it?” Which is agreed (inaudible ) to my next question which is if you could talk a bit about, sort of where your interest came from in the topic of Christian privilege? Like how did you get interested and wanted to study this and understand this construct better? 

00:07:00
JANE DEWEY So, the first time that I had terminology for this concept was when I read your article. Before it when I was looking into graduate schools and looking in to the professors that I was interested in working with and I came across your article, but the reason that the article resonated with me was that I have been thinking about this for a long time and I’d been trying to connect, pinpoint what is this exactly that I… that I sense and I think that I first started to sense it in a… in a big way in high school and college, when I was taking history classes and learning about this supposed separation of religion and state and realizing that that was a big sham. That there… there is not much of a division at all between Christianity, and state and even in the name we don’t say religion and state, we say church and state. That in itself is a Christian, is Christian privilege because there is an assumption that well this word church, people will get that, they’ll get what that means, they’ll get that we are talking about religious institutions. If someone said separation of mass and state or separation of temple and state, people would be like what? What’s that? The fact that we equate that that our… our language has incorporated Christian terminology as if these are the terms that we use across the world universally for all things and non-Christians will… will just know what they mean. People may say it’s semantics, but its more than that because language and words are what we use to communicate that what we use to write and to speak and to get to know one another. A Christian has the advantage of not having to really be aware that using these words in some way may make people who are non-Christians feel, that’s not a term I would use. You know that’s… that’s you specific, that’s your group specific, but Christians have the privilege of thinking well this is the universal term and that’s why it’s get caught up in that church and state distinction. 

00:09:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I remember an (inaudible ) from a colleague of mine who interviewed for a job in the mid-western part of the country and they said that this part of the job interview well of course you and your wife would go to church on Sunday and my colleague said well actually I am Jewish and then they said well we… they have a Jewish church about… about 50 miles away. 

00:09:35
JANE DEWEY That’s great. 

00:09:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But the reference to it as a Jewish church. 

00:09:40
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:09:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Again is that that idea. 

00:09:40
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:09:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That church is… church is synonymous with all religious institution. 

00:09:45
JANE DEWEY Right and they… they get what they need. It’s fine. 

00:09:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yeah. 

00:09:50
JANE DEWEY Yeah that assumption is based in Christian privilege. 

00:09:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. So you were talking about like you’re the origin of your interest came in high school and college where you were learning more about the separation of religion and government. 

00:10:00
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:10:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That's where you were going. 

00:10:00
JANE DEWEY Yes. 

00:10:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER (inaudible ) to do something more I want you to get you back to that was there something more about that? 

00:10:05
JANE DEWEY Sure, well that's when I started… I think really learning about history and when getting into psychology and sociology in college starting to be aware of why privilege my own privileges as a person with white skin, my own privilege as a person who identifies is heterosexual. I think a natural outgrowth of… of learning about my own privilege and learning about the way that power and systems working in this country was to kind of think about Christian privileges as well and to me Christian privilege is… is something that fascinating, and… and really important for Christian people to be aware and think about, because I… I see how it effects other areas of privilege and disempowerment in the country in other groups and I sure we'll get in to that more. 

00:11:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yeah we’ll and we can certainly sort of talk about that now if you want sort of… 

00:11:00
JANE DEWEY Sure. 

00:11:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER switch your gears and talk about how Christian privilege sort of intersects and interacts with other aspects of identity, because it’s sort of alluded to that just now. 

00:11:10
JANE DEWEY Sure. The biggest one that comes to mind, I was actually just hearing a really great talk, here at the convention. Recently there is been a lot of political activity around gay marriage, in the state of California and elsewhere and really that the argument against gay marriage there are… there are few arguments that hold any water, I don’t think any of them hold any water. But the just of them really is that marriage is between a… a man and a woman and that really is a… is a Christian value. Other religions hold that value as well, but the… the way that it has been wrapped up as an non-religious issues is kind… it’s also a sham and there is lot of shams that involved in this and so I… I knowing, growing up protestant, being the daughter of a protestant pastor, being within these systems that were having a lot of conflict around gay-lesbian bisexual issues in terms of ordination within the church in the terms of marriage, in terms of even membership in some denominations. I've been… I've struggled my whole life with identifying as a Christian because of this exclusionary sort of (inaudible ) that gets wrapped up in Christianity in general and I think a lot of Christian dominations even those that are progressive and… and moving in a positive direction in my opinion are still feuding internally and… and this… the impact of that on the (inaudible ) community is huge. I… I think that that is almost single handedly the biggest issue that is creating this inequity in that population. 

00:13:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yeah so the Christian privilege then as I see at (inaudible ) what you think is that I can be what I would call homophobic, I mean I believe that if I was, if I would say it's my religious beliefs. 

00:13:15
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:13:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But I could engage and what we might label it as homophobic behavior, but say well can’t challenge me about that. It's my religious beliefs. 

00:13:20
JANE DEWEY It's my religious belief. 

00:13:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It's my religious belief and… 

00:13:20
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:13:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …and that kind of ends the conversation. 

00:13:25
JANE DEWEY Yeah and we've seen evidence of that very recently at here at the university, you sent me an email. 

00:13:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right there is a recent… there is a recent court case. 

00:13:35
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:13:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Where a student was dismissed because she refused to work with LGP students. Said because for religious reason because of she believes what they are doing is sinful and sued over the… over her dismissal and lost. 

00:13:45
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:13:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But I'm surely will appeal I imagine. 

00:13:50
JANE DEWEY Right, she was given a remediation plan that said we fear that you can't work effectively with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients because you… you have been very vocal about having these religious beliefs, these convictions and she argued and said, “No, I can, I think I can work with LGBT individuals,” and her school said we're going to give you a remediation plan and she refused to take that remediation plan so then… so… so that's a really it's… it's interesting that, you know we’ve got some good timing in terms of thing that are happening in the world and… and in our country in particular around this issue. 

00:14:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if… if you want, if you could speak a little bit also too how religion and how Christian privilege intersects with… with sexuality but also how its gets messed up with politics. 

00:14:35
JANE DEWEY Oh! Oh big time! I don’t think that our aside from race, I don't think that our politicians get wetted on any bigger issue than religion. You know when… when a politician, when it comes out that a politician is not Christian it’s all over the press. Its… It's for some reason a big-big deal. We’ve never had an non-Christian President. 

00:15:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:15:00
JANE DEWEY We have very, we… 

00:15:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER We had one catholic President. 

00:15:05
JANE DEWEY But one… 

00:15:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And they killed him, right. 

00:15:05
JANE DEWEY Yeah that is true. We’ve had mostly Protestant Presidents and we are now starting to see of more non-Christians in the congress, in the senate, but it, I would say as far certain religions in particular Muslims we have one congressman. 

00:15:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:15:25
JANE DEWEY Right now and that is the first, so. 

00:15:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if you want to think of representativeness, Muslims are another second largest religious group behind Christians. In United States there are more Muslims now than there are Jews. 

00:15:35
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:15:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It used to be Jews as the second largest group. But there is certainly more Jewish senators and congressmen than there are Muslim. 

00:15:40
JANE DEWEY Yes. 

00:15:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I believe I saw something on the news that we now have I believe four Jewish Supreme court Justices and I think two or three catholic. 

00:15:55
JANE DEWEY That sounds probably right. 

00:15:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I can’t remember, I can't remember the break down. But someone was, was bemoaning the lack of… of protestants voice on the Supreme Courts and… and saw that also as an aspect of Christian produce(ph), here is a little bit of privilege going away. 

00:16:10
JANE DEWEY Uh… Uh… 

00:16:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And… And seeing when privilege is taken away from Christians. It seems sometimes that there is… that’s one we hear the… the war on… 

00:16:15
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:16:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …on Christians or soon that happens usually on Christmas time. 

00:16:20
JANE DEWEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:16:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if you want to speak to all that like the war on Christmas. 

00:16:25
JANE DEWEY Right and there… right, there is so many people will argue, many Christians will… will argue. Well really this is… this is becomes secularity for those who don't celebrate in the religious ways, so why can't we have Christmas parties in the work place.? I mean why can't we put up lights they're not… that's not a Christian symbol, why can't we have a tree that is not a Christian symbol. Okay you're right it's not a Christian symbol, but does it symbolize a holiday that has these religious undertones. Really overtones because Christmas has the word Christ in it ,it is a Christian holiday and people can celebrate the day with presents and Santa Claus and… and not be Christian and… and that's (inaudible ), but to have it be celebrate in such a big way and… and be and to have people get offended when you say, “You know I don’t… I don't want to you to wish me Merry Christmas because I don't celebrate Christmas, you know. That I don't, I can't really wrap my head around. 

00:17:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. Like what’s that about. 

00:17:25
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:17:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well and one of things that I… I guess I… I guess switching gears a little bit, but I wanted to frost(ph) the talk some time about us. If we think about if we understand what it is, we have a little bit about some your background like where you got interested is, how then can we help people who are educators working with students who might be watching this video or even professionals who don't really know much about the topic yet, how can we help people who are Christian, get Christian privilege meaning like sort of acknowledge that they have it as well as maybe be empathic for those who don't. You know Jewish and Muslims and Buddhists and Hindus, but also of course (inaudible )… 

00:18:06
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:18:06
LEWIS SCHLOSSER … and folks who you know are also sort of in that camp anyone who is not Christian in United States. 

00:18:10
JANE DEWEY Well in terms of helping Christians be more aware. A lot of it just has to do I thinking with broaching the topic, ah… which can be tricky, I… I… I'll tell you what in my family, I have to kind of really prepare my… not… not necessarily just in my family, but in my circle of my families friends, my family is very liberal and very progressive, but the term Christian privilege does tend to put Christians on edge. What… What is that? What do you mean by that? Because you know Christianity is a religion based on putting oneself last and putting others first and so my dad even said when I… when I introduced the term he said well, “That sounds like a oxymoron.” And I said, ”It is yeah, you're right. Because Christians in their essence are supposed to be humble and serving of others and not have privilege.” So I think that it’s jarring, its… its… cognitively and spiritually dissident think about oneself as being privileged in that round. I think also when people have multiple and minority statuses or even one major minority status to… to think about this privilege being taken, this privilege being deconstructed is very jarring too. Because maybe this is the one area where someone experience a privilege in society and this now want to re-link our status. So we’ll instead of admitting that we'll be (inaudible ) oppose the idea that it exits. 

00:19:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If so sounds like if there is a way in which that by labeling a Christian privilege or by talking about it, it may (inaudible ) defensive and are potentially (inaudible ) like a shame response to have any thoughts about how we might come out of differently. You know me and little bit of a bow(ph) in a china shop when it comes to, you know like well I see… I see Christian privilege here, I am gonna call that, but is there… is there other are the ways we might engage folks. You know in a way that they can tolerate it, you know and… and try to stick with it and then maybe get it and not just go oh, oh what is it? Like you said, what's that… what's that Christian privilege? What's that mean? 

00:20:25
JANE DEWEY Yeah. I think if we think about how we would approach a client coming to us and try to treat everyone in that same way. Where you know if a client, you know delivers the… the typical line, “Well I'm not racist or anything, but you know and then begins to tell you something that they think that’s very racist. To a client you might not directly say, “Boy that's… that's sounds like your white privileges just going crazy right now.” You know you are the one’s… really raises(ph) things that we might find a way to say it that's a little bit more empathic that’s thinking about where the fear is coming from and you know. I don’t know exactly how it would go about saying Christian privilege in different terms, but… 

00:21:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Sounds like you try to be bit empathic to be experience… 

00:21:10
JANE DEWEY Yeah to… 

00:21:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …to try to engage them in it. 

00:21:15
JANE DEWEY Yeah and maybe explore ways in their life that they have experienced being in a one down position, being out… out of a group and… and empathizing with that and then drawing a parallel, you know that I wonder how… what are your Jewish friend felt when you said that. You know I just wonder about that putting it… putting it in a different way or. 

00:21:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Or remember when you felt discriminated against because you're a woman. 

00:21:40
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:21:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And you nearly felt that that was unfair. You know it really help them see privilege in another arena where they might not have privilege. 

00:21:50
JANE DEWEY Exactly. 

00:21:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And say like see how you have privilege, you don't… you don't need to have a privilege here, but you have privilege here. So, also I guess the part of me also thinks the rule and you and I think I have talked about this the role of Christians and doing this. Because Jews and Muslims and Buddhists and folks are seen as again… seen as observing and…. 

00:22:10
JANE DEWEY Yeah. 

00:22:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If racism is gonna go away white people need to make it go away. 

00:22:15
JANE DEWEY Hmm… hmm. 

00:22:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER If Christian dominance is going to go away, Christians are probably the ones that need to. 

00:22:20
JANE DEWEY Right. Yeah that's a very good point and important point. 

00:22:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER As we get… as we're close to wrapping up one of the things I wanted to ask you is what for… for folks who are watching the video what would be like one or two things that's some sort like a take home message that you would like, people to sort of walk away with like. If they remember nothing else about the video like, “Uh… we are (inaudible ) his student, that sort of (inaudible ) they clearly enjoyed talking about this subject. 

00:22:45
JANE DEWEY Right. 

00:22:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But what do you want them to walk away with like these are some really important points about Christian privilege. 

00:22:50
JANE DEWEY Yeah. Well one of the most important things I think is that the… connection with what we're seeing happening politically with the… the civil rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual transgender people. Because I do think that this is a key area that if… if we see some awareness opening up here, if there is some awareness that not everyone believes these principles, not everyone is a biblical literalist even among Christians, that you know we need some more (inaudible ) that this… that… that there… there is much too much wrapped up in this religious identity that the country somehow believes it has, the Christian country somehow believes it has and… and is really missing out on a tremendous… that the very, the variability the difference of opinion and… and belief systems and… and all of this that goes into our society and also the… the big thing about Christian privilege is that it is a Christians privilege to deny it, to believe it does exist. That is the biggest privilege I think that… that Christians have and it's very important that… that awareness is raised that you know and what I said about words and language and it's not just semantic, it's a lot more than that. It's really important that we're careful with how we word things that they are not exclusionary and it's not just about being politically correct, it’s because it’s about caring about one another and making sure that people don’t feel excluded because you've used the word, you know church and state rather than religion and state. 

00:24:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That's excellent points. Is there anything that you… that you wanted me to ask you or do you wanted to talk about that I didn’t ask you during this interview? I think you know (inaudible ) really wanted to make sure we discussed this and we didn't get to or…? 

00:25:10
JANE DEWEY Not that I can think off. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well then we really want to thank you so much for your time and your expertise and sharing your respectives on this as it was informative. So, thank you so much. 

00:25:20
JANE DEWEY Thank you, thank you for inviting me.
