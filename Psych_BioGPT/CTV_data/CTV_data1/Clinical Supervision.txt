DAVE BARLOW  Okay, there we go. Sorry for the delay. Ahm, I'm Dave Barlow, and we are here to really focus on clinical issues, which is always interesting and -- and fun. Ahm, I will say a couple of things, how many of you were in the last presentation, where I talked about? Okay, about half of you as far as I can make out. Ahm, let me just touch on a couple of highlights for just two or three minutes and then what I will do actually is ask people to come up and sit with me and tell me about a case that we may want to discuss. I'll probably do it such that, you know, we've -- we have 10 or 15 -- we haven't got an hour, little less than an hour now. So, maybe you have 10 minutes per person to touch on some highlights of a case and we'll get as many people up as we can and I will attempt to moderate it and move it along, and of course that there are questions along the way that would be -- that would fine too, although I understand I will need to -- you know, would -- we'll see the mikes in here, I don't think so. So, I'll need to repeat the questions and oh, here is one here, yeah and one over there, so there are some here. Ahm, as those of you in the last session heard me say what we've operated in Boston in a center for anxiety and related disorders and by related disorders, interestingly, it kind of means the -- the old neurotic spectrum, which is what we're really conceptualizing as emotionally based disorders these days, maybe we'll go back to even calling it neurosis at that some point, if we look at the commonalities of -- of negative affect and attempts to really avoid or otherwise manage negative affect that -- that manifest themselves in these patients in very common ways across a variety of disorders and -- and obviously, while there may be some -- you know, when our conception of all these disorders originate, clearly there is -- there is a biological contribution. Ahm, we learned a lot about this in recent years, but it's a very non-specific, ah, biological contribution, it's -- it's kind of a the genetic contributions basically is a vulnerability that under certain conditions with the right learning experiences and the right kinds of stress or certain genes will seem to turn on and produce kind of the -- the biological bases of -- of negative affect and that other early learning experiences and very specific life experiences such as trauma, ahm, add on in a summary way to produce an emotional disorder, any one of them alone may not be sufficient. But when you look at the biological contribution, the -- the early learning experiences, where you develop kind of a sense that the world is -- is something that's, you know, in your control, that, that something you can manage, that you expect to be able to cope with life, that's a very important kind of cognitive set we develop early on. Attachment theory speaks very much to it, in terms of how that develops and -- and then the specific experiences, they all seem to summate to produce these emotional disorders. And there is only the specific experiences that really seem to point in one direction or the other in terms of just what disorder we develop as best we can tell. On the other hand, there is -- there is certainly some genetic contributions to having a panic attack, which are separate from contributions to experiences anxiety. Ahm, but just to give you a flavor for this stuff, you know, the current thinking is that depression and anxiety are two sides of the same coin, and this is the title of a very famous article by one of the leading behavioral geneticist a few years ago when describing anxiety and depression, same genes different environment, and you know, that pretty much sums it up. It also seems clear that depression is a consequence of being anxious. So in other words, aah, this is summed up by the famous kind of quote from Jerry Kleiman a number of years ago is that, you know, ahm, "all depressed people are anxious, but not all anxious people are depressed", aah, meaning that people develop kind of this anxious disposition, some then go on to develop depression and -- and others don't. So you know, there is a lot of commonalities, but what we talk about today are really cases, particularly we can focus on co-morbidity, because most of these cases have co-morbid features. We'll talk a little bit about, maybe if somebody comes up, I can demonstrate a little bit about how we, aah, go about provoking some of these emotions, aah, right in the office, so that we can actually work with them. And I'll say right now that, ahm, and we started this years ago with our patients who have panic attacks. You know, when they would come in and we'd treat them in groups, so they come into our clinic, ahm, of course we'd notice this -- all clinicians have noticed that they would tend to sit by the door, you know, with their ready exit and then maybe with their, you know, coat ready to run out the door and a variety of things, which and they might would be help them cope their -- their panic. And we would immediately bring them over to the other end of the room, whenever we notice that. And when -- then if they did have a panic attack, we would explicitly welcome it. We would say that, it's terrific, that's exactly what we want to have happen here, because although it doesn't feel good, now you can really describe for us, just exactly how you're feeling, what are you thinking, what's your bodily sensations, what sensations do you notice the most? And there's a very good chance for them to sort of, you know, step aside from themselves, while not avoiding it and focus on it, you know, really examine their emotion, which is the first step to processing it. So in our groups, we'd actually give them a little hand, you know, if they -- if they had the beginnings of a panic attack and -- and of course, this will go a long way toward changing their attitude. So we -- we do attempt to provoke, aah, emotions, obviously in collaboration -- full collaboration with the patient and I will be happy to show you a little bit about that. But in this clinical supervision, perhaps we can have some volunteers, who just may want to talk about briefly about a case they have and some sticking points. Yes, ma'am, would you like to come up? Yeah, you'd need to come up and yes I understand that come around the stairs there. Yeah. And you could have a seat here. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:30
DAVE BARLOW And she is signing a release that doesn't mean we're going to do anything real scary, but understand it's pro forma. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:45
DAVE BARLOW And the others of you might be thinking about you know, some cases you may wanna bring up and discuss that would be of some general interest. Yeah, right over here. Thanks. How are you? 

00:07:55
DEBORAH Good. 

00:07:55
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Deborah, I'm Dave. Yeah. 

00:08:00
DEBORAH Nice to meet you. 

00:08:00
DAVE BARLOW Have a seat. 

00:08:00
DEBORAH Okay. 

00:08:05
DAVE BARLOW Now, let's see we just... 

00:08:05
DEBORAH Now, help me with my own anxiety first. 

00:08:10
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, nothing like exposure. 

00:08:10
DEBORAH Ahm. 

00:08:15
DAVE BARLOW That maybe you could, yeah -- you could give me, ahm, you know, a little capsule summary of the case you might be seeing that -- and then we can take off from there. 

00:08:30
DEBORAH Okay. Ahm, I work in a pain management centre. 

00:08:30
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:08:30
DEBORAH And we have a patient who has severe back pain and Graves' disease and she has, ahm, she is -- her eyes are severely affected by the Graves' disease. Anyway, I knew she had gone into withdraw basically stayed at home in her bed for a year, year and a half, until she came to us. And she didn't reveal to me until recently I started working with her individually, and her lawyer called her out of the blue and she found out that a case she had filed with the EOC had come through and it turns out she had been through an experience that was very traumatic for her just before the onset of her Graves' disease and just before she withdrew into her house. And this case coming back up and her needing to testify his brat out a great deal of anger and anxiety and she's withdrawn again after she had started reactivating? 

00:09:30
DAVE BARLOW And -- and -- and how long have you been seeing her? 

00:09:30
DEBORAH She came for our pain management program probably about four months ago, and I've seen her somewhat erratically, because she doesn't always come or she comes 15 or 20 minutes late, so I can't always see her, but often... 

00:09:45
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:09:50
DEBORAH For about four months probably. 

00:09:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And the -- the -- ahm, she came to see you then after having been kind of house-bound, withdrawn into her house for a period of time? 

00:10:00
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:10:00
DAVE BARLOW Up to a year, you said? 

00:10:00
DEBORAH Yeah, little over a year. 

00:10:00
DAVE BARLOW And that seem to be an emotional reaction to her disabilities, ahm, that -- that withdrawal... 

00:10:05
DEBORAH That's what I thought until she shared. 

00:10:10
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, until she shared this EOC, Equal Opportunity Commission. 

00:10:15
DEBORAH Yeah. I don't know if you want the details of the traumatic experience or not? 

00:10:20
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Let me just briefly, it will be useful and when did that it occur? 

00:10:20
DEBORAH It occurred last January. 

00:10:20
DAVE BARLOW Last January. 

00:10:25
DEBORAH Yeah. And what she shared was that she had given up a number of physicians in that community where she felt like she was really helpful to work for a pastor at a church, the church she had been going to for all of her life. It was an important part of her life. And he was apparently doing some tax evasion and she brought it up to him and one night he came to her house and she welcomed him and introduced her sister and... 

00:10:50
DAVE BARLOW This is her that -- that the pastor? 

00:10:50
DEBORAH Pastor. 

00:10:50
DAVE BARLOW Pastor. 

00:10:50
DEBORAH She was working for, she gave up her other jobs to work for... 

00:10:50
DAVE BARLOW To work for this pastor, yeah. 

00:10:55
DEBORAH And she knew this stuff was going on and she brought it to his attention. So he invited her to come to the church and look over some plan, some building plans and, you know, she said great and she went with him and there was a room full of people who confronted her and blamed her for all the problems and she described that she said it was almost like he raped me. She said it felt like a lynching, you know that he came and he pretended he was her friend and she had shared that it destroyed her beliefs in the church and pastors and so this is what went into her withdrawals, her belief in the world was shattered. 

00:11:30
DAVE BARLOW Sure. Yeah. That would -- that would certainly do it. And so right after that, ahm, she began to withdraw. 

00:11:40
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:11:40
DAVE BARLOW And also came down with the Graves'. 

00:11:40
DEBORAH Yes, soon after, a couple of months after. 

00:11:45
DAVE BARLOW Couple of months after? 

00:11:45
DEBORAH This incident. 

00:11:45
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And generally, the pain. So she really had a major reaction to that... 

00:11:50
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:11:50
DAVE BARLOW Probably -- perhaps physically. 

00:11:55
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:11:55
DAVE BARLOW Or it could have been coincidence, but certainly emotionally and the two of them have been summed up. So that was last January, now it's December and you had -- you had begun to bring her out of this. 

00:12:05
DEBORAH Yes, yeah. She started to do some work again, she started to go out, she... 

00:12:10
DAVE BARLOW And when did you start to see her? Four months ago, you said. 

00:12:15
DEBORAH About then. 

00:12:15
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, so September something like that. 

00:12:15
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:12:15
DAVE BARLOW And she began to get out, began to do some work... 

00:12:20
DEBORAH Yeah and the lawyer called out of the blue, she had filed the case last January and he called to say they found 'em guilty of some counts, now we need to go to court now and it's just like paralyzed, but it also has brought up this rage. 

00:12:35
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:12:35
DEBORAH And it worsened to agoraphobia. She doesn't wanna go anywhere, she doesn't want to do anything. 

00:12:35
DAVE BARLOW Sure. Okay. Well that's -- that's very good. So let's talk about, here we -- here we have, you know, an incident of, you know, clear trauma and let me just ask up until the point of this traumatic experience, how was she functioning. Does she have a history at all of any, you know, emotional difficulties or other psychological disorders? 

00:13:00
DEBORAH She says no, she -- by -- by way of history, she grew up in a -- in a large family, very repressive, ahm, they basically were only allowed to go home and to school and church and that's all. 

00:13:15
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:13:15
DEBORAH So that's her background. In terms of emotional difficulty, she says she didn't have any up until that -- that time, up until last January. 

00:13:25
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And her living situation, does she have a family, is she married? 

00:13:30
DEBORAH She -- her sister lives with her, but they don't interact. She doesn't attract with her family very much at all, even her children and her grandchildren, she has a hard time when their run is over stimulating for her. So she doesn't interact much with anybody, and nobody in her family knows what's going on. 

00:13:45
DAVE BARLOW And how old is she now? 

00:13:45
DEBORAH How old is she? 

00:13:50
DAVE BARLOW Approximately? 

00:13:50
DEBORAH She is about 40. 

00:13:50
DAVE BARLOW She's about 40. So she -- she is currently married or divorced? 

00:13:55
DEBORAH No, she's not married. 

00:13:55
DAVE BARLOW Never married? 

00:13:55
DEBORAH No. 

00:13:55
DAVE BARLOW Okay. Never married, but there's a sister who lives with her in the same house, but they don't interact. 

00:14:05
DEBORAH No, there don't. 

00:14:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And then children in the community. 

00:14:10
DEBORAH She has a daughter who comes by and brings her children and she has, again she has a very hard time to noise, the movement, it's just overwhelming for her, so she has a very difficult time when they come over. 

00:14:20
DAVE BARLOW Okay. And when you first saw her, she was able to come out of the house and come to your office then... 

00:14:30
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:14:30
DAVE BARLOW There wasn't a home visit. Yeah. 

00:14:30
DEBORAH No, she came to our program... 

00:14:30
DAVE BARLOW Did she come accompanied? 

00:14:35
DEBORAH No. 

00:14:35
DAVE BARLOW Okay. But she came for pain management. 

00:14:35
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:14:35
DAVE BARLOW Okay. And this sort of thing. And who referred her to, I mean, how did she get there? 

00:14:45
DEBORAH Ahm, I assume, it was one of her pain physicians. 

00:14:45
DAVE BARLOW Okay. 

00:14:45
DEBORAH Sorry, I don't recall. 

00:14:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, who recognized she was in. 

00:14:50
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:14:50
DAVE BARLOW And more associated difficulties and some... 

00:14:50
DEBORAH Right. 

00:14:55
DAVE BARLOW The pain. Okay. And he was successful. But now she's faced with -- with the prospect of testifying, is there dates in? 

00:15:00
DEBORAH There was a date, ahm, in fact I saw her on the date that was supposed to be and then it was reset for February, so. 

00:15:10
DAVE BARLOW Okay. So she hasn't -- so you have a few weeks or -- come up or so... 

00:15:15
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:15:15
DAVE BARLOW To work with her. Well, looking ahead, ahm, you know, so here is a woman who -- actually it sounds like probably you came from what does it means, but was functioning reasonably well, working and productive and had given up, you know, one position for this working more closely with the pastor and then had her world shattered as she pointed out. 

00:15:40
DEBORAH Right. 

00:15:40
DAVE BARLOW So, now she's faced with the prospect. She's still, now, she's back to being kind of house-bound. 

00:15:45
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:15:45
DAVE BARLOW And what's going to -- and what happens, ahm, what seems to be keeping her in the house? Is it -- is it... 

00:15:55
DEBORAH It's -- right now, very, very significant depression. 

00:16:00
DAVE BARLOW Okay. So it's a withdrawal or shutdown? 

00:16:00
DEBORAH Also anxiety when she is around people, again she gets very overwhelmed, she feels like people are looking at her... 

00:16:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:16:05
DEBORAH And judging her, and it makes her very uncomfortable. But she is, ahm, you know, her thyroid levels go up and down and -- and so she can be very agitated and anxious and then she can have virtually no energy at all, where she feels it's very hard for her to move. And so right now her depression is very significant and she -- she has very little energy, very little motivation. 

00:16:30
DAVE BARLOW Did you have like a -- a back level on her depression or you did a back test or something like that? 

00:16:35
DEBORAH Aah, you know, I -- I measured it at the beginning and end of the program. 

00:16:40
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:16:40
DEBORAH But not recently and from what I recall that was probably in the severe range, probably around 30, 30, 35. 

00:16:45
DAVE BARLOW We'll often administer, you know, something like that, some... 

00:16:50
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:16:50
DAVE BARLOW Quick questionnaire, may be every couple of weeks, you know just to. 

00:16:55
DEBORAH Okay. 

00:16:55
DAVE BARLOW Have engaged on. 

00:16:55
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:16:55
DAVE BARLOW Kind of severity and how they're doing. All right. So, let's look ahead then to now you want her -- you kind of reactivate her... 

00:17:05
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:17:05
DAVE BARLOW Get her out of the house, get her ready for the... 

00:17:05
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:17:10
DAVE BARLOW The testimony. Ahm, and what you're pointing out obviously having observed her and knowing her now such as experiencing a number of emotions. 

00:17:20
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:17:20
DAVE BARLOW A lot having to do this, she's angry again and but also anxious. 

00:17:25
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:17:25
DAVE BARLOW And, ahm. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
DAVE BARLOW What does she say about the, ahm, prospect, you know, of actually getting up there and testifying. What is it that's the worst for her? 

00:17:50
DEBORAH Ahm, we've talked about her seeing him, she's having thoughts about killing him. Ahm, she has no intention at all to harm him, in fact she's a very peaceful person. 

00:18:00
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:18:00
DEBORAH But she's experiencing this rage, this almost homicidal rage, and at the same time, she doesn't wanna have a civil suit, of course she doesn't want to cause him monetary harm, it's a very odd dichotomy or something. Ahm, so she's very afraid of having to face him again and having that even intensify her emotions even further. That's one aspect of it. 

00:18:25
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:35
DAVE BARLOW In terms of the -- the -- the ambivalence about doing this. 

00:18:40
DEBORAH Okay. 

00:18:40
DAVE BARLOW Have you begun to work that through with her? 

00:18:45
DEBORAH Well, what we talked about is... 

00:18:45
DAVE BARLOW The pros and cons, how she really feels about them, I mean, then all the ambivalence. 

00:18:50
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:18:50
DAVE BARLOW Certainly, it sounds like it has an emotionally driven side to it? 

00:18:55
DEBORAH Yes. Well, we talked about, ahm, the possibility of using this as an empowering tool, you know, it's a means of expressing herself, her story, her belief in what is right in a -- in a format, where she is allowed to speak her truth. 

00:19:10
DAVE BARLOW Great. 

00:19:10
DEBORAH And she is definitely put that under advisement, let's say, you know, and really took that in and thought about it. That was just the last time I saw her, that she's -- when I came to the conference. 

00:19:20
DAVE BARLOW So you just began to work on that. 

00:19:25
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:19:25
DAVE BARLOW So that sounds like it'll be an important, you know, initial step, as you're beginning to work on -- on other things. 

00:19:30
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:19:30
DAVE BARLOW So that let's you get that straight, that it's really, you know, in her interest than it in society's interest to get the truth out and... 

00:19:40
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:19:40
DAVE BARLOW You know, if she can bring -- if you can bring in to that point and if she's willing to go to that point. And then beyond that, it sounds like as you pointed out very astutely that she is also afraid of her own emotional reactions. 

00:19:50
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:19:55
DAVE BARLOW And the emotions in particular she's worried about her anger and what -- and what fear, anxiety? 

00:20:00
DEBORAH Ahm, anger is what we discuss... 

00:20:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:20:05
DEBORAH An imagine anxiety, which may be related to the anger kuz it makes her very uncomfortable. Ahm... 

00:20:10
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:20:10
DEBORAH But, you know, I guess it’s important to know just in terms of the post-traumatic, she does keep replaying the event repeatedly in her mind, that's what she had shared with me. 

00:20:20
DAVE BARLOW Oh, usually the event in the -- in the church, which she where she... 

00:20:25
DEBORAH Last January. 

00:20:25
DAVE BARLOW The pastor brought her to... 

00:20:25
DEBORAH And particularly, when he came to her door that was it sounds like the most traumatic part of the event because she felt like it was a setup. 

00:20:35
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:20:35
DEBORAH And she see some coming to... 

00:20:35
DAVE BARLOW Oh, was that a setup? 

00:20:35
DEBORAH It was. And she sees his face, she keeps seeing his face over and over again, the face that's supposedly friendly, but it’s off a size. 

00:20:45
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Now what's her effect like as she's relating this. 

00:20:50
DEBORAH Well, she has, ahm, in general her effect is very blunted, ahm. 

00:20:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:20:50
DEBORAH But as she talks, you can see underlying it an agitation and anger, but it's very much controlled. 

00:21:00
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, yeah. And that probably relates also to your observation that she's afraid she's going to burst loose. 

00:21:10
DEBORAH Yes. 

00:21:10
DAVE BARLOW And therefore she being, you know, perhaps shouldn't go to this testimony because these worst things may happen, you know. So it sounds like then, you know, you are -- just focus on this, a bit of it because that's certainly the immediate problem something you have to work through. Ahm, there's a couple of things that certainly I would recommend doing. Ahm, first of all, we know that she -- while -- while she can identify the anger, you know, that as with most people who have been traumatizing this kind of a trust breaking situations, probably there are a lot of other emotions there too, ahm, there may well be some, you know, real anxiety about going to testify after all these must have been a horrendously frightening event, you know, to be confronted in the hostile way by -- by this whole group and here, what does she has to do now, she has to go to trial and, you know, and confront, you know, certainly he's gonna be hostile, she was -- someone you trusted. And these courtrooms are never easy. You know, maybe should be cross-examined are that just works -- sort of a testimony it is, but perhaps she knows, or she doesn't know yet. Ahm, and you know, maybe there is a bit of shame, I mean, you know, this is often this mix of emotions. Ahm, while doing the trauma work you're beginning -- that you're obviously beginning to do and that is, you know, bring out, you know having her... 

00:22:40
DEBORAH Yeah. 

00:22:40
DAVE BARLOW Go through the thing, but trying to get the effect. 

00:22:40
DEBORAH Right. 

00:22:45
DAVE BARLOW You know, in your presence in a safe place trying to get the effect out, you know, giving her permission. 

00:22:50
DEBORAH Right. 

00:22:50
DAVE BARLOW To feel the anger, the sadness, the -- the betrayal. Ahm, obviously, it's the first step. And one way we often, ahm, begin to get her that is by actually role playing. 

00:23:05
DEBORAH Okay. 

00:23:05
DAVE BARLOW Role playing some of this initial incident, you know, number one, just to help, you know, bring her to the point in your presence, you know, being able to work through this with the effect, not gonna do any good to discriminate about it. 

00:23:25
DEBORAH Right. 

00:23:25
DAVE BARLOW You know just kind of relive in a -- in a kind of a left brain as we say, kind of way, where it's just kind of a rebelling, kind of effect suppressing activity. But, you know, she needs to relive this. Ahm, the other thing that might be useful is to -- this is the advantage of this -- this kind of role playing, you know, almost like a stealth technique, is ahm, let's enact what this testimony is gonna be like. Right now, it's -- it's horribly overwhelming to her, isn't it? 

00:23:55
DEBORAH Right. 

00:24:00
DAVE BARLOW And well, let's go through it, you know. And what emotions is she feeling, and attempting to provide perhaps a little clarity, you know, to her emotions. 

00:24:10
DEBORAH Okay. 

00:24:10
DAVE BARLOW And in the very first instance there wouldn't be assessment with that. 

00:24:15
DEBORAH Right. 

00:24:15
DAVE BARLOW Because you'd say, now let's say what exactly are you feeling, some anger, what else, let's see what you're feeling. And, you know, sometimes, we'll do that several times with our patients. It also assists I think with the -- the sort of narrative reliving of the trauma. And then you might have, you know, first of all, you -- you began to make the unknown a little more known. So here is a mock testimony, you might even do a little research on it, say just exactly what they would be wanting you to do. 

00:24:45
DEBORAH Right. 

00:24:45
DAVE BARLOW Then what the setting would be and who would be there? What sort of questions you might have? 

00:24:50
DEBORAH Right. 

00:24:50
DAVE BARLOW You know, so that you can really do, you know, to dig into this quicker. Then the issue would be, you know, while continuing with -- with the trauma work, ahm, how can you best prepare her to deal with her principal fear, which may be her own uncontrollable emotion response. And so once you've identified the emotions, ahm, you know, then certainly you can look at it and do some other cognitive work, a little -- a little, you might have experience with some cognitive. 

00:25:20
DEBORAH Oh, yeah. 

00:25:20
DAVE BARLOW Sure. Yeah. Then a lot of that. So, okay. Let's say in the courtroom, you know, you get your anger wells up and you get fury, as just for the point of demonstration, I'm sure this is -- this sort of thing you would do in the cognitive work. Ahm, what's the sort of thing you are concerned about happening was at the end of that emotion and you've already given some hints she's afraid she's gonna kill him. 

00:25:55
DEBORAH Right. 

00:25:55
DAVE BARLOW Right. Okay. So then along the lines of, okay, you feel like you'd like to kill him, you're afraid you might actually kill him. Is there a difference between those two things. And let's deal with, I mean, what is the probability that if you go that -- if you did get angry, if you had some understandable anger, you would kill him. You know, how likely is that when you go through that, you know. 

00:26:25
DEBORAH Right. 

00:26:30
DEBORAH Sometimes we say to our patients, you might accept the scene first, you know, while you have to go through the metal detector, so you probably wouldn't have to bring a knife in, right or a gun, so you probably wouldn't have any weapon, could kill him with your bare hands, but chances are there is -- there are some guards around there, you know. 

00:26:50
DEBORAH Right. 

00:26:50
DAVE BARLOW Who -- who might be able to help you out a little bit. But nevertheless, so what's the thinking about realistically the situation, because now we're just dealing with it realistically, not emotionally, and you are not angry now, but we're just in anticipation of it. You know, what's the probability that you'd end up killing him, maybe say well it's not that high, maybe it's just 5%, I'll kill him. And we say so that means, you know that -- you know, if you went into this courtroom, aah, and you have the multiple visits. It still be a real good chance you would kill him. But how would you do that, then you -- you sort of examine the evidence for it, you know what's the chance your emotions are going actually cause you to do something that would be so horrific. Well, probably and working with her a little bit and of course this is a system that trauma work as you go along, and working with her a little bit, you know that the goal would be to help her to realize the probability, that was really, really pretty low. You know that it was -- it was not that bad. Okay, so then what's the next thing. This is just to take one more thing. What would, ahm, happen, let's say the probability to kill him really -- really almost not existing because that'll be a tough place to kill somebody. Ahm, what would happen if you just got angry? You know, what would be the worst thing to happen if you got -- if you got angry, but killing him was other option, because nobody would let you do it. What would happen? And then maybe, we might look at that consequence. Well it might be simple things. She shakes all uncontrollably that she, you know, aah, aah, fall down and beyond it loses her muscle and motor control and -- and particularly with her physical condition, you know, beyond able to function. Well that's -- there is a probability to that happen. So again, we'd look at, you know, these various consequences of scenarios and -- and see, you know, to kind of test them out in a typical cognitive therapy, right. We might also note -- we can go on -- go on with this, but just take one more thing. We say, oops, what if you really did get angry. You get so angry that you couldn't even answer a question for a minute, you know. We might say would that be the end of the world. Would that be the worst thing that ever happened. You certainly have the right to be angry, everybody would recognize that. And -- so that would be kind of decatastrophizing the anger so what, if you get really intense with emotion. So, you see, all of these procedures would be to basically set the stage for her to experience emotion, this intense anger and whatever other emotions you've now identified in the role play, you know, without the -- the with the different kind of, you know, way of appraising that state, this very fearful uncontrollable thing that's happening in her own body. Then we might actually, ahm, to get her ready for this, once you've completed your assessment. You know, we might, through some role-playing actually, you know, attempt to provoke a little bit of anger. Give her permission to be angry, say, you know, he is this minister who after all had disaffect in your life. Ahm, ahm, there's nothing wrong with being angry and we'll see what it feels like. Ahm, and finally -- and the sort of what we're talking about earlier in terms of changing, you know, action tendencies, what was the action tendency for anger, we're sticking with the anger for a minute, we recognizes other emotions here too shame, fear and there is probably some anxiety about just being in a -- in a courtroom. So what's the action tendency for anger? well she's expressed it. It's lunging at the person, you know, and doing some hard. So what would sort of be, you know, the antidote to that. Well there's a number of antidotes to that, but there's some wisdom certainly in some of the previous -- in psychotherapy over the ages. And some of that wisdom can be found in some of the humanistic therapists, such as Viktor Frankl, you know, had this technique, paradoxical intention. And what he would do is he made, well, know some of you have studied this, is often have the individual kind of inner spurs their anger with something, aah, that was sort of say, comical. You know, maybe there is something you might have -- listen something about this -- this individual that, you know, was a little weird or comical or maybe he's you can picture him with the helpless expression on his face after all these years or doing something funny or making a strange face and something what she said, you know -- you know may be this, ahm, and act this so in such a way may be she just finds a speck of humor, you know. And that will be something you have to be careful of. 

00:32:15
DEBORAH Right. 

00:32:15
DAVE BARLOW Because of course of the -- the traumatic component of it. But generally, we would go right to those emotions you've identified. We'd attempt to assess them, you know, even more fully get the range of them, and while doing the trauma work and the narrative and attempting to get out the emotions, remove her anxiety about feeling intense emotions over this and get it ready through role-playing to -- to actually testify. But this will be a challenge, yeah. 

00:32:45
DEBORAH Yeah. Well thank you. 

00:32:50
DAVE BARLOW Well thank you very much for coming up. Yeah. 

00:32:50
DEBORAH Thanks a lot. 

00:32:55
DAVE BARLOW Nice to meet you. Did very well. Yeah. Any questions about that case before we, yes sir you want to or just yeah, if you want to come with the microphone. We'll just take two or three questions and we'll give somebody else a chance for the case, let's see the time. Yes, sir. 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN How if at all what do you try to deal with what look to me like a basic world view, a devastation of the basic world view in this case? 

00:33:20
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, how would we deal with that? 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:33:25
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, I think and that's obviously not easy to deal with, you know that, that's a very difficult sort of situation. So, you know, and that sort of instance there is a lot of perspective taking and a lot would depend on, you know, the various strengths she had in her life. Ahm, so the question would be, you know, he was a -- woman who trusted of all people are pastor, you know, very, very important in her life. Ahm, and unfortunately this would be difficult work as it done someone like just from the -- we had, there is a lot of other people in her life she does trust, well that she does have close relationships with. But obviously the way to working, it's with the therapeutic relationship itself would be important is to attempt to, ahm, maybe look at examples, you know, in her life where they were people she could have trusted, perhaps growing up, perhaps there are other, you know, people in church, which has probably attracted to a church for a reason, that was a very safe place growing up. And maybe she had four or five other individuals who were very trustworthy. So then we would again perspective taking, probability estimates, that's just mean that everybody you ever meet again in your life, you know is gonna be the SOB that this guy was. Oh!, this maybe a bad apple that if we all run into occasions. So we'd -- we sort of take some kind of attack like that, you know, when look at it, I don't still trust. May we have then another volunteer, who could talk about a case? We have somebody here. Oh, good, great. Right. You are? 

00:35:05
CHUCK Chuck. 

00:35:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Have a seat Chuck. 

00:35:10
CHUCK Okay. 

00:35:10
DAVE BARLOW Chuck was nice enough to loan me his laptop, so I could show my PowerPoint. 

00:35:15
CHUCK This is payback. 

00:35:15
DAVE BARLOW In the last presentation. Yes. 

00:35:20
CHUCK I have a client who was -- she has PTSD, she was sexually abused by her stepfather being at about age nine and then by her half brother also by the age 12. Her coping mechanism was to run from the home early on and she got into drugs and alcohols seriously and severely for number of years and then had a stroke about two years ago. She has been clean since, ahm, and she's just -- she spends her time, she is safe coming to my office, going to church, going to see family and going to a GED program that she enrolled in about four -- two months ago. Otherwise she is at home watching soaps or sleeping. 

00:36:10
DAVE BARLOW Okay. And how old is she now? 

00:36:10
CHUCK Late 40s. 

00:36:15
DAVE BARLOW Oh, late 40s? 

00:36:15
CHUCK Late 40s, yes. 

00:36:15
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. So this has actually been going on a long one. 

00:36:20
CHUCK Long time, yes. 

00:36:20
DAVE BARLOW And it's only been the last two years, she's really been clean. 

00:36:20
CHUCK Right. 

00:36:20
DAVE BARLOW And that was precipitated by a stroke. 

00:36:25
CHUCK Stroke. Exactly, yes. 

00:36:25
DAVE BARLOW And the stroke, did it leave some sequelae? 

00:36:30
CHUCK Yes. There is some brain damage showed in a neuro psych eval in about April of this year. I don't know exact results, but it's pretty serious -- serious brain damage. 

00:36:35
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. So she have, just in the way of background, is there any period of her life, and it sounds unlikely from what you say, where she was let's say functioning at close to, you know, a reasonable levels such as carrying on her job or something? 

00:36:55
CHUCK Ahm, limited. She had some experience in housekeeping at one part of her life, but she dropped out of school at about 16... 

00:37:00
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:37:00
CHUCK So she could -- never finished high school, in fact, she's been trying to get her GED currently. 

00:37:05
DAVE BARLOW Oh, trying to get a GED currently. Well, that's -- that's very encouraging. 

00:37:10
CHUCK Right, it was, but she... 

00:37:10
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And you've been seeing her how long? 

00:37:10
CHUCK Since August. 

00:37:15
DAVE BARLOW Oh, yeah. So -- so in the last two years, then she's been drug-free, she's been clean as you point out. She's, aah, working towards a GED and is she close to it. 

00:37:25
CHUCK No, she's just beginning the work. 

00:37:25
DAVE BARLOW Just beginning the work towards GED, but she's begun that. 

00:37:30
CHUCK Right. 

00:37:30
DAVE BARLOW And her current living situation is what? 

00:37:30
CHUCK She's living with her boyfriend currently. Boyfriend she had known prior to this stroke and liked him quite a bit. But she's back with him now because he provides a place for her to live and she wants a place to live, she -- she's for quite -- a been homeless, it's one of her fears that she'll be homeless on the street if she leaves him. 

00:37:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:37:55
CHUCK She would like to marry him, but he -- he is stalling saying that he would marry her, it will ruin his credit rating. So... 

00:38:05
DAVE BARLOW If he marry, what? 

00:38:05
CHUCK If he marry her, it would ruin her -- his credit rating. She of course had bad credit record, of course you might imagine. But her fear seems is of abandonment by either him and or all of her family. She copes by doing whatever she can for any family member including buying things for her mom, for her -- she has two daughters, one late 20s, one got 14. 

00:38:30
DAVE BARLOW Oh, she does have two daughters. 

00:38:35
CHUCK Two daughters. 

00:38:35
DAVE BARLOW And where do they live? 

00:38:35
CHUCK They live in the town also, but separate from her that the older one is living on her own. 

00:38:40
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:38:40
CHUCK The younger one is living with one of her sisters. 

00:38:45
DAVE BARLOW One of her sisters? 

00:38:45
CHUCK Yes. 

00:38:45
DAVE BARLOW So she has a sister? 

00:38:45
CHUCK Yes. 

00:38:45
DAVE BARLOW Who evidently is reasonably responsible... 

00:38:50
CHUCK Yes. 

00:38:50
DAVE BARLOW And she is in a position to take care of her daughter. 

00:38:50
CHUCK Yes. 

00:38:50
DAVE BARLOW Any other family members? 

00:38:55
CHUCK Also there is a brother around somewhere, another sister also. 

00:38:55
DAVE BARLOW Brother around somewhere, but doesn't sound like she has much connection with him? 

00:39:00
CHUCK Well, she does -- she sees them irregularly, I would say. 

00:39:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:39:05
CHUCK She tends to avoid them because she sees them as always denigrating her. She says my opinion counts for nothing with my family. 

00:39:15
DAVE BARLOW She says what? 

00:39:15
CHUCK My opinion counts for nothing with my family. 

00:39:15
DAVE BARLOW Oh, in her family. I see. Yeah, okay. Yeah. And that's it for then or any -- any other close friends, any -- any other resources in her life that would be something to, you know, begin to hang -- had on social... 

00:39:30
CHUCK Only other possibility it is church... 

00:39:35
DAVE BARLOW Church. 

00:39:35
CHUCK Yeah. She goes to church on Sundays and she is in the process of joining a -- a programmatic church for mentoring others. It's like a team approach, she's gonna joining a few other ladies in mentoring some younger people in her church. 

00:39:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. And how is she, is she -- is her boyfriend supporting her financially now? Or does she receive some kind of assistance? 

00:39:55
CHUCK She receives, yes, the disability assistance. 

00:40:00
DAVE BARLOW Yeah, disability. 

00:40:00
CHUCK And then once she runs out, he fills in. Somewhat begrudgingly. 

00:40:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. But the -- the disability will continue with her, right? 

00:40:10
CHUCK Right. Yes. 

00:40:10
DAVE BARLOW But it's a small amount of money. 

00:40:10
CHUCK Yes. 

00:40:10
DAVE BARLOW And okay. And why is she coming to see you now? Four months ago. 

00:40:20
CHUCK She was referred by another agency that they were not being helpful with her. They've actually forward her to me by then because of our expertise in disabilities and brain injuries specifically. 

00:40:30
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:40:30
CHUCK Ahm, and she wants help to, I guess a little more normal life, she wanted to get her GED, wanted the motivation to get out of the house and do those things. 

00:40:40
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:40:40
CHUCK But she is -- I'm just so fearful of two things. One that is, if she goes anywhere else other than her safe places, she will either go back to drugs or to selling herself and getting a sexuality again. She was having the sexuality for number of years after the trauma in childhood obviously. Ahm, so she fears going back to old habits that she doesn't want, wants to get rid of. 

00:41:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Ahm, so she -- are there some things that she would specifically like to do, but again has the safety issue and is afraid to -- to take those steps? She's getting her GED. I mean, it sounds like you're doing great work, aah, supporting her and -- and kind of boosting her to the point where she is for the first time in, you know, her life even with the disability, pursuing some -- some very worthwhile goals. But what else would she -- would she like to do. Do you think she would like to or you mentioned the -- the mentoring others, the helping others. Ahm, ahm, is she -- is she able to take the first steps to do that or she restricted from doing that? 

00:41:55
CHUCK She has done to this point, although just recently she told me that it's getting hard for her to go to the GED classes because, you know, she recognizes there are things she just can't seem to catch on to. 

00:42:05
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:42:05
CHUCK Mathematics for example, it's very difficult for her. So she's getting kind of little somewhat discourage already with the GED classes. 

00:42:15
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:42:15
CHUCK Ahm, she wanted -- one of her goals was to, to go back to work. She did wanna get to some kind of a job, probably part-time. She realized that, but she wanted some kind of employment. 

00:42:25
DAVE BARLOW But so for she has missed with the school, the GED? 

00:42:30
CHUCK She is well, she has missed occasionally, but not... 

00:42:35
DAVE BARLOW But she's following through... 

00:42:35
CHUCK Right. Yes. 

00:42:35
DAVE BARLOW And how long she been doing that, the GED? 

00:42:35
CHUCK About two months now. 

00:42:40
DAVE BARLOW About two months. Oh, it’s great. So she did under you? 

00:42:40
CHUCK Yeah. 

00:42:40
DAVE BARLOW With your help. 

00:42:45
CHUCK Yeah. 

00:42:45
DAVE BARLOW Anything else she'd like to do? 

00:42:50
CHUCK I think, she hasn't voiced this to me, but it really seems she'd like to have, basically, just healthier relationship with the boyfriend especially. 

00:42:55
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Okay. To what extent is the trauma, which of course will always be with her, particularly that -- the extent in kind of a terrific quality of that trauma, but to what extent do you see at present in her current, aah, emotional life, relationships etcetera? Any flashbacks, any, any avoidance of -- I'm not telling disavoidance of sexuality, what about the sexual relationship with her boyfriend. 

00:43:25
CHUCK Well there is some dissociation of source with the sexuality. She's not there doing sex she says. 

00:43:30
DAVE BARLOW Okay. 

00:43:30
CHUCK She's elsewhere and there have been history of some pretty serious nightmares where she is being chased or being victimized in some way. 

00:43:35
DAVE BARLOW And are those present now or just occasionally in the past? 

00:43:40
CHUCK Since a recent change in medication they are -- they've almost disappeared the nightmares at least yeah. 

00:43:45
DAVE BARLOW Oh, then what meds of those? 

00:43:45
CHUCK It's one of the Neurops -- I've forgotten which one exactly. 

00:43:50
DAVE BARLOW Neuroleptics. 

00:43:50
CHUCK Neuroleptics, yeah. 

00:43:50
DAVE BARLOW Okay. Interesting. So I mean in this case, aah, I mean it sounds to me like -- like you're really doing some great work Chuck with -- with hers a very difficult case long-standing, ahm, ahm, aah, trauma induced, aah, aah, escape and dissociation and so often see these people running away from themselves, and the physical condition on top of that -- gee, you know, in four months she's begun to get her -- her GED. She obviously someone is looking on the edge and, but she is, you know, she has managed to survive up unto this point and is now turned her life around and she feel good about that. Is she able to recognize that she's been cleaned for two years, she's now getting her GED, she's on the verge perhaps, you know, going in a new direction in her life. 

00:44:45
CHUCK She -- she can state it, but she kind of discounts it. 

00:44:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:44:50
CHUCK As you might expect, that's not -- it's nothing. She also, you know, her faith is increased, of course that's her faith now that gets her through. 

00:45:00
DAVE BARLOW And so in the -- are there any family members who have recognized the positive steps you've taken, I mean the boyfriend give her any credit, any positive feedback or... 

00:45:10
CHUCK It doesn't seem to me that she gets much support from anyone really. 

00:45:15
DAVE BARLOW Her sister. 

00:45:15
CHUCK The sister's all blame her. In fact, just recently again in terms of that the flood they're going back. 

00:45:20
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:45:20
CHUCK She got into pretty serious conflict with family. She got angry, she yell at them, cursed at them, walked out of the house. 

00:45:25
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:45:30
CHUCK She even went to a -- her drug dealer to get someone on for old drugs and but didn't buy because he didn't have a pipe to sell her. 

00:45:35
DAVE BARLOW Oh, oh, yeah. Okay. So that's kind of a -- ahm, then, but, but she hasn't gone back to that. So that was a one good slip. 

00:45:45
CHUCK I said it's a good job you didn't... 

00:45:45
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Terrific. You kept her away from it. You know, I mean it tactually -- I mean, you're dealing with -- these is -- these are very difficult cases, but yet she is -- she has obviously got some strength in her, she's got some resilience, you know, she's taken these steps, she's trying very hard, it doesn't sound like, you know that -- this clearly her -- in her personal relationships, you know, are affected by this trauma. Have you done any trauma work with her, have other people attempted to do trauma work with her? 

00:46:15
CHUCK I wanted to get to that point, but I've been, mostly so far, I was just trying to be supportive... 

00:46:20
DAVE BARLOW Stabilize her. 

00:46:20
CHUCK I'm trying to get that next step... 

00:46:25
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:46:25
CHUCK Where I'd like to go from here. 

00:46:25
DAVE BARLOW Stabilize her. Well, I think you're doing a great job. I mean, I would certainly at this point that's exactly certain what I would do also and I expect most people in the audience. You know, ahm, you're going to look for, you know, what does she have in her environment. Ahm, what are the -- the sources of resilience and strength? Well if you get her into that stretch related mentoring program, I mean that might be a source of support despite the hard story we heard in the last case. Hopefully, that wouldn't be replicated in this one. 

00:47:00
CHUCK I hope that. 

00:47:00
DAVE BARLOW But, you know, that sounds like it might be the next step, while she continues her GED, you know, get a little more positive, aah, things going in her life you got her, aah, you know, retaining her being cleaned, you've got her, getting her, GED and, you know, then at that point, you know, maybe she'd be ready for, ahm, the -- the sorts of work that might begin to repair her ability to relate in a more productive way with -- with people and perhaps ready for a bit of trauma work. Boyfriend says, that sounds like a very shaky situation and so we'd all just hope that we'd hold together. 

00:47:40
CHUCK Yeah. I Hope so. 

00:47:45
DAVE BARLOW You know, for another say, you know, period of time, six to eight months. In the meantime, you know, I might also attempt this perhaps you already had done, trying to anticipate, you know, the pressure points in her life coming right up. Okay. What is it that, you know, emotionally throws her off to fight with her sister. In a relapse prevention kind of way, you know, how could we deal with that? Can we proactively rehearse with her in a way at least, you know, mentally you may be even role-playing thing that -- the types of things that might drive her to drug again, that might drive her to -- to relapse and, you know, perhaps extend some of the relapse prevention efforts that would anticipate there was skews and her reaction to it and make sure she has a good clear alternative, you know, place to go, including calling you, and certainly you already have done something like that. And, aah, it sounds to me like you've done great work already and you're on the right track and hopefully you can bring her further down that room to having some -- some happiness in her life. 

00:48:50
CHUCK Okay. Thank you. 

00:48:50
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. Thank you. Chuck. 

00:48:55
DAVE BARLOW We just have a couple of minutes left. Ahm, so I think if there are any questions, we will just maybe finish of the session by a little bit of discussion or questions or anything anyone would like to, ahm, add to this. The lights are blinding you from the sides, I can see you in the center now, yes ma'am. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Is it working. 

00:49:30
DAVE BARLOW Yes. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm wondering in session, I'm hearing you say, ahm, you help them with the perspective taking, help them to feel free to express their emotions and so for that sounds a lot like what we've done in the past with like, aah, desensitization and such. When you've visited and evoked the emotion in session with them, I'm hearing you suggest that we don't, you know, then at that point teach them to use distraction or relaxation as we might have done before, but instead, ahm, to encourage him to go toward a changed action tendency that's what I'm not quite understanding what do you mean -- what do we actually do when the emotion is evoked in session. If we're not going, moving toward to self soothing... 

00:50:10
DAVE BARLOW Yeah. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Activities that they can do in those moments, which is what we've I think often times been doing. What do you actually do in those moments in your office then to encourage an action tendency? 

00:50:20
DAVE BARLOW That's a very good question. That kinda go to the heart of the -- the distinction that we're trying to make, and so I'm going to ask that. Ahm, it's -- to state it kind of fundamentally, what we are really attempting to do is to move them away from any strategies, which would actively avoid the emotion reaching its full intensity or any strategies after the fact that would intend to suppress it. The -- what I didn't say, that question really prompts me to say it, is this is where acceptance comes in and acceptance is a very hard topic these days across many approaches to psychotherapy and -- and for good reason. But what acceptance does ideally is let you stand beside yourself and say go ahead, you know, let the emotion peak and let's just examine it, let's see what it looks like, tell me about it. You know, what physical sensations are you exactly feeling? What are the cognitive processes? Ahm, what is it -- what is subjectively what does it feel like? What do you feel like doing with the emotion? Tell me everything about this emotion. Now notice what happens with that kind of strategy, you know, and then -- and then let's -- just let the emotion flow, you know, let it flow right through, so we can get the best idea of -- of what's happening with it. Several things that happening with that -- it's supposed to be distracting itself from feeling the emotion or somehow doing something that dampen the emotion after the fact. You know, I'll get to the action tendency thing in a minute. So, what that accomplishes is -- is several things. First of all, at an emotional level, in addition to a rational level, ahm, they learn that, you know, experiencing this emotion, aah, is not the worst thing in the world, aah, you know, it can just happen and run its course and if I just let it happen, you know, there's really going to be no serious consequences to this. Remember the data I presented earlier that what these people with emotional disorders have in common is that they've been unable to tolerate intense emotion, and therefore they engage in all these maladaptive strategies to, aah, aah, prevent themselves from experiencing these emotions. If they just let it flow, just be a spectator, accept your emotion, let it go -- let it go through. We do the same thing with people with obsessions and this is an integral part of the treatment for obsessionality and -- and part of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The metaphor I use is, ahm, if somebody very common for women in our clinic for example to -- to particularly, young woman with young children, who come in for whatever problem, we now routinely ask this question. Do you ever have any thoughts of harming or hurting your children? And they are so relieved when we asked that question. Because these anxious woman no matter what they are diagnosed have never told anybody in many cases. And 25%, 40% of them will have this -- have had this thought and to them, it's the most horrific thought harming their baby, you know, and then what we do is we normalize it. We tell them these are the most normal things in the world. Everybody has these kinds of thoughts. You know, if we put a thought broadcaster on people’s heads, walking down the street, aah, you wouldn't wanna hear, you know, half of the things that people are thinking off, it would be, you know, horrendous. But what our most people do? Most people let the thoughts go in one ear and on the other, in one ear or the other, a couple of minutes later they won't even remember. We do the same thing then with emotions. We'd say, so the difference with the people's obsessions is they are horrified by the thought and they attempt to suppress it. Then what happens? It gets worse and more frightening. Same thing with emotions. They are horrified by the emotions, they attempt to suppress it. Let the emotion flow, just let it happen. Now in terms of the opposite action tendency, we're not telling them to suppress the emotion, we're telling them, while they're having the emotion, do something different. Let's do something different, let's take it from this side of things, obviously instead of running away from something extraordinarily frightening, let's approach it, you know, instead of attacking someone who is angry, let's be aware of the emotion, but perhaps, ahm, you know, look at the funny face and do something humorous or something like that. So it's the difference, we're not avoiding the emotion, we're encouraging the experience of it, while changing the behavior. Our time is up. Thank you very much for coming. I've enjoyed working with you, and thanks to all volunteers.
