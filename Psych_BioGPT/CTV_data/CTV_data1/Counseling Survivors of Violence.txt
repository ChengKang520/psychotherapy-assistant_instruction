COUNSELING SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE Nancy Baron Interviewed by Allen Ivey 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Nancy Baron, it's really a delight to have you here. Ah, your experience, as I've talk to you in getting ready for this tape is many ways taking away my breath. Ah, you've been in Japan. Ah, in case you had your own mental health practice there, then you've gone on to work in Cambodia, ah, Sri Lanka, and now your working in Uganda with, ah, victims, survivors of really serious trauma. And, ah, I found helpful talking to you and listening to these principles and common sense they are- 

00:00:40
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:00:40
ALLEN IVEY - in the way you organize and present your case is kind of fascinating. So, as we share your work, ah, I think we might start with, could you tell us a little bit about the work settings in the places you've been and, ah, some, some stories of your background, how you got into what you're doing? 

00:00:55
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm, well, uhm, I finished my doctorate in 1989, uhm, after a long haul and realized what I always really wanted to do is join the Peace Corps, uhm. I hadn't joined the Peace Corps when I was 20. So, there I was 15, 20 years later, feeling like it's really what I wanted to do. However, with the degree in, uhm, in Counseling Psychology and Family therapy, uhm, people overseas weren't quite sure what I could do. Uhm, so, I kinda went a very frustrating, ah, time in New York and in Washington, going to all of these organizations that do helping, like, ah, many organizations and found that they weren't very interested in mental health. So, I saw this ad in the newspaper that said I could go teach English in Japan and I got on a plane and I went to Japan. Uhm, and I had never been in Asia before, though I was fascinated by Asia. And slowly, over the couple of months, the first couple of months I was there, realized I was not gonna be much of an English teacher, uhm, and met some people who were interested in expanding a Psychotherapy practice. So, I spent my first three years working with ex-patriots, uhm, within Tokyo. We had about, a third of our population were Japanese and I specialized in couple's work. So I had Japanese married to anybody you can imagine. 

00:02:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:10
NANCY BARON So, it's very exciting and very interesting. Ah, my heart, however, still wanted, very much to be doing work with refugees or displaced people and worse things. 

00:02:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
NANCY BARON Uhm, so, I, I wasn't having much luck with the organizations, the kind of structured organizations. They keep saying to me, "Well, we deal with food and we deal with shelter," and I keep saying, "But people's mental health is critical to the success of any kind of project." But they didn't understand that very much, in those days. Uhm, so, I went to Sri Lanka, uhm, quite by accident. I thought I was going for a short time, uhm, and I met a group of people, group of women who where doing work with the war widows, uhm, and I found that they were, uhm, a very interesting group, uhm, and they didn't know what to do about mental health. So, I joined them. And they where doing empowerment workshops that we're looking at since we can all make a kind of technical training, and I started doing uhm, mental health work with the same war widows. 

00:03:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
NANCY BARON  And we did many, many things. Uhm, but, you know, most, I think the most interesting of which is that, I started doing something which was drawing the story of your life and working with the illiterate, basically illiterate, illiterate widows, uhm, drawing the story of their life and then having them tell the story, uhm, to other widows who were from the ethnic backgrounds that were politically opposed to each other. 

00:03:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
Story-telling is basic 

00:03:30
NANCY BARON So, for example, a Tamil woman might tell a Sinhalese woman the story of her life, which included her husband being murdered by the Sinhalese and the Sinhalese telling a Tamil woman the story of her life, which included her husband being murdered by a Tamil. And we did this as a way of both empowering these widows, but also as community building. So, that's when my work began. Uhm, and we, uhm, is very exciting. The wid-, the widows, uhm, developed so much strength from it. I mean, the empowerment was a beautiful thing to see. Uhm, so, it also empowered me - (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
NANCY BARON - to realise I could do more. Uhm, and I moved in to then doing this big book project with My Children's Book, ah, children book that I wrote about, uhm, a, a father dying and empowering children. We did that in Sri Lanka. And then, from there, uhm, I did a tour around Asia. When the war in Sri Lanka had stopped, uhm, I decided it was time to move on, and I ended up in Cambodia. Uhm, and in Cambodia, worked a lot with street children and then worked within the displacement camps that still exist in Cambodia. Uhm, there were still many tens of thousands of people living in displacement camps in Cambodia, uhm, where many people have forgotten them. Uhm, and so, I did work with those people, as well as with the 300,000 or so refugees who would come back to Cambodia after spending 12 years on the Thai border. Uhm, so, the experience in Cambodia was, uhm, very difficult one, uhm, also because that I'm afraid that, that the Western Governments, uhm, have not, been fair to Cambodia, uhm, in this present tense, anyway. They still suffer tremendously from a war that we kind of left them behind in. 

00:05:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
NANCY BARON So, there was a tremendous amount of suffering that still exists there. And I'm afraid just, I mean, the war seems to continue day by day. Uhm, so, I spent two years in Cambodia and, uhm, then was offered a position with work with the Sudanese refugees in Uganda, which is where now I am. Uhm, and I've just recently gotten there. 

00:05:30
Basics in Working with Survivors 

00:05:30
ALLEN IVEY  So, you've had a lot of experience. Let's go back to Sri Lanka. 

00:05:40
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, ah, the empowerment work with women- (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
ALLEN IVEY - and, ah, was at this part that you developed the model or out of that, you developed the model, you got to share it with us later? 

00:05:50
NANCY BARON  It began there. It very much began there. Uhm, what we, what, I had spend so, many years in school that, you know, we were, I was filled with models. I was filled with ideas and models and very complicated ideas. What I realized in my work in Sri Lanka was that I had, in order to be able to train people, in order to be able to help other people to do basic counseling, I had to simplify every model that I ever knew and kind of reduce it to its simplest form, uhm, and be very concrete, very practical, uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
NANCY BARON - and very common sensible. So, that, that's really where my model begin because I realized I had to do that- (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
NANCY BARON - beginning with that work in Sri Lanka. 

00:06:35
ALLEN IVEY So, working with, ah, women with mental health issues in Sri Lanka- (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
ALLEN IVEY - and, ah, what did you find worked with them? What was the process? 

00:06:40
Physical symptoms a common reaction among survivors 

00:06:40
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. Again, the what we found was the major complaint and I would have to say that this is true in Sri Lanka, Cambodia and in Uganda, the major complaints were always physical. Now, I think we might also find that true in America, uhm, that, that the major complaint is my head hurts, my stomach hurts, my back hurts, I feel anxious but, but not the essence of what the feeling that connects to it is. And- (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
Nancy Baron's approach to working on issues of emotion is in some ways similar to the way we teach emotion in schools and counseling training programs 

00:07:05
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
NANCY BARON - and, and in those countries, I'm afraid that, that, that they've not, there's no been, no one that's taught awareness about feelings. So, I would do simple things like draw faces on a, on a black board and show smiling faces, sad face, and I had to explain what feelings where. 

00:07:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
NANCY BARON Uhm, and once I kind of explained what I was talking about with feelings, then they begin to understand that, and then slowly, we connected these physical pains to the emotionality. So, that's where we always begin, was that the physical pain is always what comes forward first. 

00:07:45
ALLEN IVEY So, one of the things you began with is really kinda like, going back to elementary school where we might be teaching children to name and identify feelings- (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
ALLEN IVEY - is that that exercise you use as often used in elementary children. 

00:07:55
NANCY BARON Yes. That's right. 

00:07:55
ALLEN IVEY You found that working in Sri Lanka, that, ah, they were so out of touch with the feelings. They didn't know what a feeling. It was probably part of the culture as well. 

00:08:05
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
ALLEN IVEY So. (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
NANCY BARON Yeah. I, I think that, that we would say out of touch but that would have to do with our Western kind of influence. 

00:08:10
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:08:10
NANCY BARON For them, it just as never necessary. 

00:08:15
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:08:15
NANCY BARON Uhm, that life, again, in many of these cultures, life is a, much more simplified. As you get up in the money, the morning and if you live at an agricultural society, you get up in the morning and your day is filled with hard work in order to be able to survive, in order to be able to eat. There isn't a whole lot of time to spend and thinking about "how do I feel." Uhm, so there was really never a reason for that, besides the fact that for many of these people, if a country is basically politically calm, there's no major explosions emotionally going on. So life is fairly, uhm, stable. So there's not strong burst of emotionality anyway. Uhm, and I don't, I don't think people, in fact, were denying feelings or not aware. I just think it wasn't, just not part of the culture, just not, It's not culturally in context to what they understood. 

00:09:00
ALLEN IVEY  Naming feelings also means you have to start doing reflection to some extent- (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:09:05
ALLEN IVEY - about you're being- (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
ALLEN IVEY - or if you're just being and doing, you don't reflect. 

00:09:10
NANCY BARON Exactly. 

00:09:10
ALLEN IVEY And so, you actually began with these people in terms the real concrete, centering order, specific idea of naming feelings. 

00:09:20
NANCY BARON Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
ALLEN IVEY What happened after, after that? 

00:09:20
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
ALLEN IVEY I mean, name, this, this they began to name the feeling, the sadness, hurt, or whatever? 

00:09:25
NANCY BARON Uh hmm, but at first, I mean, it was like a game. It's like " how many feelings can we come up with?" And so, and, and they would. They would come up with feelings. And again, I did it with both adults and children. And so, they would come up with, you know, many, many, many feelings, feelings that, you know, we're different than what we would come up with, but they, they come up with many, many feeling. And then, as they would come up with them- 

00:09:45
From Feelings to Narrative: The importance of sharing stories 

00:09:45
NANCY BARON - stories. And so, for example, I might tell a story of, you know, there was this woman that I met one time and she came to talk me because she had this terrible, terrible pain in her head, and when I asked her, you know, "Where is this pain coming from?" she says, "Oh, I don't know, it just hurts terribly in my head," and then I would tell about how I asked her about the rest of her life and I might find in the, and I would tell the story of how maybe she told me about her son-in-law being away in prison and then coming back from prison and, uhm, how he's now living on the community and how he causes troubles in the community and on and on. 

00:10:30
Connecting emotion with the story 

00:10:30
NANCY BARON And then I might ask, "But when did your headache's begin?" "Well my headaches begin around the same time" and then being able to explain how the headache then connected to the story they were telling or this woman might tell. So, I would use telling a story about someone else as a way of showing them this kind of examples, connecting the emotionality with some of the physical response. By doing that, it was a very easy way, third person is always easy, as a way for them to understand what I was talking about, and then they very quickly on their own would come up with their own story about, "Oh, well, maybe my headache comes from my stomach ache, comes from..." also because they weren't accustomed to talking about feelings. They also weren't inclined to deny them either. So, they weren't gonna, not, not want to tell the story. They were actually quite willing to tell the stories. And once it kind of opened the faucet- (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
NANCY BARON - uhm, it was often hard to, to stop them, you know? And I'd have to be, sometimes, I had to find that I had to control it sometimes because I was worried that too much would be said too fast. 

00:11:25
ALLEN IVEY So, you're naming the feelings- (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
ALLEN IVEY - and you move from that to story-telling and the story telling. 

00:11:35
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
ALLEN IVEY And, and the story-telling, i think you stressed, was about others rather than themselves. 

00:11:40
NANCY BARON Right. 

00:11:40
Story telling about someone other then the client 

00:11:40
ALLEN IVEY  Explaining why you're having to tell a story about somebody else rather themselves,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
NANCY BARON I mean, it's. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
ALLEN IVEY - that's, ah, a little bit different. 

00:11:50
NANCY BARON Yeah, it's, it's easier. I mean, again, we're, two reasons. One is that, uhm, it's an easier way of recognizing something that I think when you talk about someone else, it's easier to, at least initially to be more open about it. Uhm, but also one of the things we had to be very careful of was that we had to work, I, I think in all my work, it has to be very gentle. 

00:12:15
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:12:15
NANCY BARON It's because people are not accustomed to this kind of feeling explanation, as the one wants to be very gentle about the, the way in which you approach it. 

00:12:25
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:12:25
NANCY BARON So, we don't want to, if you tell a story about yourself, the raw emotion is gonna be much stronger and much harsher. Uhm, when you tell a story about somebody else, though you might be thinking about yourself, the, the emotion is one step removed because a lot of our work is in war zones, a lot of our work is in areas where we don't know if we'll be back next week or the week after or when we'll be back. We have to keep everything in small segments. So, we don't want to open up too much, uhm, unless we're very confident that we're gonna be there. And for many of these people, too great an expression of this kind of emotionality, uhm, it, it, not just in my work, but in other's people work has been proven not particularly useful. There are studies and research projects that have been done in other, in other places that have shown that, too, brought an exposure, in fact, caused people greater, uhm, discomfort and, and was dangerous. So, that I think it's not just me but others that have found little or very gentle approach was, was safer. 

00:13:20
ALLEN IVEY So, dealing with, ah, a Cambodian family here in Amherst- (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
ALLEN IVEY - rather than asking that family tell their story, could you- (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
ALLEN IVEY - tell a story of another family- (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
NANCY BARON Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:30
ALLEN IVEY - and what happened to them. 

00:13:30
Emotions exist in a family context. Note concrete approach to Perspective taking 

00:13:30
NANCY BARON  Yes, and, and then work with them about understanding, uhm, the emotions within that family, uhm, and then maybe even working with them on role playing in that family, working with them on problem-solving with that family, doing all sorts of things surrounding that other family. 

00:13:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
NANCY BARON That, of course, would, we all know connect to their own family, but it's a safer way of doing it. And then on your own, when that family is prepared, they will then put themselves into those positions. And I found that people, on their own, moved to that next step and that was much better than you pushing them too fast and too hard into that, uhm, exposure. 

00:14:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. It's interesting thing you call me to just terms of perspective taking if you work with the concrete population and you're- (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
ALLEN IVEY - talking concretely about somebody else. They actually are or you're actually putting them on somebody else's perspective. 

00:14:30
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:14:30
ALLEN IVEY And, then they can come back to their own, that, actually, is a wonderful way to teach perspective-taking. 

00:14:35
NANCY BARON Exactly, so, it, it becomes, but also a community-building exercise. 

00:14:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
NANCY BARON I mean, so much of my work is revolving around that where we've got communities that have been destroyed if the families that have been destroyed. Again, by using that third person, I think you're very correct in saying is that then that person is having a perspective on another family. They're looking at the pain of another family. It also will open them up to think of the pain of the other families that surround them in the community in ways in which they can share the pain and hopefully support each other. Uhm, in a lot of the situation's that I see, people are so desperate, that it's very difficult to think about helping somebody else. 

00:15:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, So, I, I hear, I've got that now you talk, you used the word gentle catharsis, and the gentle catharsis is often telling somebody else's story first- (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
ALLEN IVEY - and come back as they were telling their own story in their own words, but they do or not. 

00:15:25
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
Individual, Group, and Community 

00:15:25
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, do you tend to work individually or in groups? 

00:15:35
NANCY BARON We do both. I mean, it depends on the situation and depends, you know, many, many different things. Uhm, again, I, I, I encourage community in family-building. So, uhm, as much as possible, I would like to do my work within group settings. Uhm, we're also working in environment, environments where confidentiality is absolutely impossible, is that if you're working in a refugee camp, you've got, you know, houses lined up, we've got one great big warehouse where you might have hundreds of families. You can't possibly have a confidential interview. It's just very, very difficult, as well as people want each other to know each other's business. In fact, they quite like that. The classic, I was doing an assessment in camps in, ah, Cambodia, and the classic was that I kept trying to ask the person I was interviewing with a question, but don't the neighbors by that al-, always were coming in to my interviews and the neighbor woman would always kind of answer the question for the woman and I started getting, it was very difficult for me. So, I would kind of try to push the neighbors away or I try to focus on the person I was asking the question to. I finally when I was smart enough to give that up and allow the natural course of events. I realized, in fact, that the woman that I was asking the question to would wait for the neighbor to answer, and in fact a very much liked when the neighbor or her mother or her sister or somebody else answer the question. And they usually answer them accurately, and it was part of this, this community, uhm, support network. There was a nat, this is the way this- (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
ALLEN IVEY A kind of natural circle of questioning. 

00:17:10
NANCY BARON - community talked. It's a natural circle, exactly, and when I allowed it to be, you know, rather than foolishly trying to push a western confidentiality perspective, when I allowed it to just be, uhm, I realized that in fact it, it was a very beautiful way of getting community building naturally to take place. Uhm, it's very easy. 

00:17:25
ALLEN IVEY  So, I imagine, you also have done some group work where you had sort of have a junk(ph) story- (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
ALLEN IVEY - told- (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:17:35
ALLEN IVEY - by the group. 

00:17:35
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:17:35
ALLEN IVEY And might be about the real or fictional person? 

00:17:40
NANCY BARON Yes, yes, with many times. We do real or fictional people or animals. Uhm, we'll create a problem and them we ask them. We go person by person to try to solve the problem. Uhm, I do that with kids and with adults, both. It doesn't mean that we don't talk to people about, directly about themselves or about, you know, their aunt, their uncle, or, you know, their families. We do, do that. Uhm, but again, it's a, it's an approach that by going this kind of side way, that allows us sometimes to, to get more information. 

00:18:10
ALLEN IVEY And when you got the story out, you draw the connections with often physical issues- (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
NANCY BARON That's right. 

00:18:15
ALLEN IVEY - and, ah, they seem to accept, accept that and then you move then to, ah, community building- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
ALLEN IVEY - and some acts on that- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
NANCY BARON Yes, yes. 

00:18:20
ALLEN IVEY - after, ah, you talk about that later. 

00:18:25
Working with severe trauma 

00:18:25
ALLEN IVEY - about that later. Ah, what if, does this works when you're dealing with really severe trauma, murders, rapes, ah, et cetera? 

00:18:40
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY You go through those stories? 

00:18:40
NANCY BARON Well, it depends. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
ALLEN IVEY Was that, is there that central of what you do? 

00:18:45
NANCY BARON Well it depends on who we're working with, again, is that, when I'm working, uhm, when I was working in Sri Lanka, in the displacements camps, uhm, a lot of, for example, if somebody had murdered somebody or somebody was a rebel, you, you weren't going to get that information and you didn't want to get that information. It's too dangerous for everybody. So, that you had to often times do the kind of stuff that I'm talking about is kind of circumventing work because you couldn't safely get some of this direct information. Uhm, so, yes, someone might be within that group who was a rebel and who might have done some pretty awful things, but you weren't going, you weren't gonna directly get that information in those group settings. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY And that's still true here in this country as well. 

00:19:25
NANCY BARON Yes, yes. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY  Because, ah, both, both the rebels and the people who work with the, with the certain regime- (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
ALLEN IVEY - are here. 

00:19:35
NANCY BARON Yes, exactly right. They're here and they can't really say who they are and to put them into, uhm, a one on one counseling or as, you know, more analytical kind of counseling situation, most of these people, first of all, they wouldn't come and, secondly, wouldn't be comfortable. But it doesn't mean that we can't help them find some kind of inner, uhm, peace or whatever, and that we can do that. This kind of work will allow somebody within a group to, to do some work by themselves. I mean, that's the kind of personal empowerment that goes on when you do this kind of work within a group, is you tell one story and everybody has their own take on it, and everybody does their own personal work at the same time. 

00:20:10
ALLEN IVEY  Some interesting parallels with, ah, alcoholics, anonymous,- (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
ALLEN IVEY - ah, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:20:20
ALLEN IVEY - they see where the groups- (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
NANCY BARON Exactly. Yeah. 

00:20:20
ALLEN IVEY - ah, et cetera, except that little more emphasis here in drawing connections to some of physical issues. 

00:20:30
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
Note That Nancy constantly seeks to connect stories to emotional and physical issues Community Development: Again note the skills development closely parallels counseling training issues. 

00:20:30
ALLEN IVEY  Also, you're specifically aiming toward the community development. I want you about must speak more to the community involvement and, ah, action places- (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ALLEN IVEY - this point. 

00:20:50
NANCY BARON Yeah. I, I think that a lot of work kind of stops after they do this kind of emotional work and, and it's not enough. Uhm, the, the people that I train, uhm, are very much, I, I train them in very practical problem-solving skills. Uhm, the issues, I mean, at first, we have to deal with emotional issues, but we also have to deal with the practical issues that some of the people were working where they are hungry or they have no shelter or, uhm, they, they are suffering, you know, some of the, yeah, I mean, just imagine the pictures- (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
ALLEN IVEY uh hmm. 

00:21:20
NANCY BARON - of refugee camps. I mean, that's where we are. 

00:21:20
ALLEN IVEY "Don't give me counseling, I'm hungry." 

00:21:20
NANCY BARON Yeah, right. Exactly. So, you know, you know, so, I very much train people that, you know, once we kind of open up some of this emotional stuff, then let's get very practical, I mean, very quickly because we can't push emotionality when people are hungry. I mean, it's ridiculous. I mean, so, we then have to look at, is there enough food? Is there, is there an adequate shelter? What is the health care situation? Uhm, and we have to do some very concrete problem-solving around that. I work very in trying to train people to, not only just give the problem-solving, but to try to empower the people as they're working, to teach them how to solve their own problems. It's one thing for me to take them by the hand to, you know, uhm, uhm, helping organization and say, "Please give them food." It's another thing if I take them by the had and show them where the organization is and, of course, show them how to do this themselves. 

00:22:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
NANCY BARON Uhm, we all, we all know that as a kind of basic knowledge. Uhm, but I. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
ALLEN IVEY So, so, how do you specifically go about teaching these people problem-solving? 

00:22:20
NANCY BARON Yeah, well, it's hard work. Uhm. 

00:22:20
ALLEN IVEY Are you using our traditional model to define the problem, generate alternatives? 

00:22:25
NANCY BARON Yeah, very much. Yes, very much so. I mean, we do very basic treatment planning and very basic treatment planning, look for goals and objectives and timetables and, you know, that's what we look for. And so, I teach the people who I'm training how to do that. 

00:22:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
NANCY BARON Remembering the people that I'm training are, uhm, people who are part of the communities that we're working with. So, if I'm working in a refugee community, I'm training refugees. 

00:22:50
Trainees for helping are also traumatized 

00:22:50
NANCY BARON Well, people I'm training have suffered just as much as the people who are helping. So their issues are very much the same. So, first, I have to teach them the problem-solving, help them to get their own lives in order. Once they get their own lives in order, then, I can help them to use the same skills that they've learned to help other people. 

00:23:10
ALLEN IVEY Now, to conquer (inaudible ) this just a bit, you see? 

00:23:12
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:23:12
ALLEN IVEY I think, the most people who look at this and know the problem-solving model- (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
NANCY BARON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:23:15
ALLEN IVEY - use it one way or another- (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
NANCY BARON Right. 

00:23:15
ALLEN IVEY - so, that the basic to our five-stage model there- (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
NANCY BARON Right. 

00:23:20
ALLEN IVEY - in microskills and all that. But what would be an example of the type of problem, ah, or type of problems you would have worked with in Sri Lanka-(crosstalk) 

00:23:30
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
ALLEN IVEY - and Cambodia? 

00:23:30
NANCY BARON I only think of a very concrete one. I, I worked in, ah, Cambodia in the refugee camps that, uhm, their, their displacement camps, not refugee camps, and when I went into the displacement camps, uhm, at the request of, uhm, of a major organization, uhm, that what was very clear, uhm, very quickly was that there wasn't enough food, uhm, and that food was supposed to be being delivered to these people and, and it wasn't getting there. Uhm, and so, I started talking to little old ladies and school teachers and community leaders and traditional healers, everybody, about just to be clear that this really was what the issue isn't sure enough, this was the issue. So, we worked with putting together groups of people where we could work very directly with them, and the problem is there's not enough food. The problem is, this is who's supposed to provide the food. The problem is, they're not providing it, they're not providing it for this, this and this reason, uhm, and then teaching the people how to approach who they needed to ask for help. Uhm, so, you need to ask this one. This is how you need to approach it. This is what one needs to say. If you approach it this way, what will happen? So, we would work out the ways in which one could approach the situation in order to solve it. Uhm, and, you know, we found that in fact, uhm, by teaching this, and then, but, but some of it, I mean, there's also the practical issues of the people we're talking about that need to talk to people who may be, you know, 50 miles away and there's no cars, there's no buses there. And so, we also had to take some of them by the hand and do some of it with them. Uhm, but what we found is once we did that with community leaders, we then went toward community leaders and said, "Okay, who now in your community, even if the food is provided, is still gonna be in trouble?" And they're helping them to identify the most vulnerable in their community, uhm, the elderly without family, the orphans, the abandoned children, uhm, the mentally-ill, the most seriously affected, helping them to identify those people and then helping them to develop plans for those people as well. So, there, it's very concrete. Uhm, and that's a combination of. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
ALLEN IVEY Well, you also work in a group of people in these places where lives were totally in chaos- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
NANCY BARON Complete chaos. 

00:25:30
ALLEN IVEY - so there's no, so, there's no organization. So, really, you're imposing some, some order on the disorder. 

00:25:40
NANCY BARON Exactly. And so, it's a combination of social work, uhm, and then psychotherapy depending on who we're dealing with it and when we're dealing with it. It's a combination of, of all of these factors kind of together. So, we do what I call community social work. Uhm, it's, it's, uhm, very, it's, it's a different model than just a social work or just psychotherapy. It's not just, it's not either one of these things alone. It's a combination of those things. 

00:26:05
ALLEN IVEY I do wanna stress here at this point is we talk, I mean, it stays now about school, community, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
ALLEN IVEY - communication, and variants of, of, a variant, involvement of parents and in the schools. 

00:26:15
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, there's everything you said in your model, ah, could be adapted, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:26:20
ALLEN IVEY - as a, as a general model for parents, family, school, relationships. 

00:26:25
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:26:25
Nancy stresses involvement of those "helped" in defining their own direction. The counselor and traditional healers 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY  So, ah, one thing I think you've done which is critical, I think we might wanna shift to as part of this now, uhm, is the role of traditional healers and, ah, you don't just do it but you're really, your main effort is this training- (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
ALLEN IVEY - ah, and training is treatment, and you're really, you're really interested in training others to do this. Ah, so, in fact, you're in there and other people carry on with the model. Tell me a little bit about- (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:27:05
ALLEN IVEY - how you select, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
ALLEN IVEY - I think, you mentioned traditional healers were- (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
NANCY BARON Right. 

00:27:10
ALLEN IVEY - important part of them. 

00:27:10
NANCY BARON Right. It's that, again, it depends on the, we were working with the population is but, again, we don't want to just impose western models. And so, we don't wanna just come in and choose a few people and kind of develop social workers or psychotherapists or whomever. Uhm, what we want to do is look at what is the natural way in which these communities usually take care of themselves. 

00:27:30
Search for natural leaders 

00:27:30
NANCY BARON And so, in many of these communities, uhm, that there are traditional healers, there are religious leaders, there are government leaders, there are women's leaders, midwives, I mean, they, they've got, each community has its own grouping of leaders that would be their natural people who would help them in times of crisis. What's. (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
ALLEN IVEY And this is even in a ref-, ref, ah, displacement camp. 

00:27:50
NANCY BARON  Absolutely, in any situation. 

00:27:55
ALLEN IVEY Any situations, certain people stand out as traditional healers or leaders? 

00:27:55
NANCY BARON Absolutely, always. And it because, again, if in a refuge situation, if a village is displaced, the whole village goes. 

00:28:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
NANCY BARON Uhm, if, you know, five villages are displaced, they all go. They might get scattered around a bit but a healer is still a healer and they still have their skills. And if you put into a camp situation, they still try to sell their skills to help people. Uhm, most of these healers don't work for free so that they try to sell their skills. Now, some are good and some are not good. I mean, it's like any, any professional. Uhm, but what we do is we go in and we try very hard to identify who the natural people are that would be doing this kind of work. We try to look at what the natural models would be that would be the models, that would be models for helping. So, for example, in some communities, uhm, spirituality or prayer or whatever might be the most powerful model in the past. Uhm, in other communities, you might have, uhm, what we would call exorcisms, might have been the, the most powerful model of the past. In other communities, you know, herbal remedies might be the most powerful model. And each community has its, you know, has its own. What, what we would do is look for these natural models, uhm, look for people who are credible and who look like they, you know, have good skills, but then we would recognize very often that the trauma had been so extreme that these people no longer could maintain, uhm, the balance. They, they just couldn't do it anymore. Uhm, so, they were trying very hard with their usual means or usual remedies to help a situation that had gone far beyond, uhm, what they knew what to do with. It also would be that they were suffering as well. So, what we've tried to do is then to use those people as the people we train, uhm, so we bring those people into our training groups. We teach them the kinds of things that I'm describing, different ways of existing, different ideas about mental health, ideas about communication, but building hope. I mean, we do all sorts of things with those groups and encourage them to use the skills that they get from us in their own workup. Uhm, so, what we do then is again, we're trying to strengthen the natural ways in which the communities help themselves. 

00:30:00
Teaching listening skills. If people are to tell stories, volunteers need to learn how to listen to them. 

00:30:00
ALLEN IVEY  Now, when you teach the listening skills to draw the stories- (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
ALLEN IVEY - together, what you do is that they, you do much with it in your training as you would do in your, in the framework of helping who are presented. Ah, do you actually go far as to teach specific listening skills or- (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
NANCY BARON Oh, yeah. 

00:30:25
ALLEN IVEY - how detailed do you get in that type of thing? 

00:30:25
NANCY BARON It was, again, it depends on where I am, what the situation is. I mean, I could do training for two hours, I could do training for months and months and months with people. Different places I've worked I, you get different opportunities and, uhm, and just based on settings. I mean, whether or not I'm in a, a setting that is more, uhm, ah, chaotic or less chaotic you, depends on how much time you have to train people, uhm, how much funding is available and all sorts of questions. But, I, certainly, when I'm trying to teach people, you know, listening skills, use many of the techniques we would use here to teach listening skills. I mean, I, I do exercises where I show them how to do it and I role play and then I have them do it in pairs and I have written all sorts of exercises where you ask each other questions. I mean, it's the usual stuff that we do here that increases and encourages listening skills. Uhm, so, it's very much from my training, you know, from here that, that, that I, I would use that listening and then it moves into active listening and how to ask questions and it moves into empathy and trying to show them how, uhm, the importance of empathy and obviously, the idea of, you know, sitting in someone else's shoes. I mean, every place I've ever been, I have big diagrams, you know, people trying to stand in each other's shoes. 

00:31:40
ALLEN IVEY So, so, the, one of the issues, I think, is important for people to think about whether at school or community, you know, how center is you get out of your office, find community leaders- (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:31:50
ALLEN IVEY - and then, basically, do what we already know how to do. 

00:31:50
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:31:50
ALLEN IVEY  But the main thing I've heard different in terms of action is the idea of story-telling about other people- (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
NANCY BARON Hmm. 

00:32:00
ALLEN IVEY - but it has particularly coz you're working with issues of severe trauma. 

00:32:05
NANCY BARON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:32:05
ALLEN IVEY And then you're gradually going back to, to a sharing type of situations. 

00:32:05
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
ALLEN IVEY So, in fact, you're telling us that we already know how to do this if we have a courage to do it and, by the way, how to get out- (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY - rather than sit and wait for the one person that it was. 

00:32:15
NANCY BARON That's right, that's right. 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY  You also meant that a group community work is much more important. 

00:32:20
NANCY BARON Exactly. It also is admitting and this is, I think, sometimes a little hard for all of us after so much, so many years of education, is admitting that you can, in fact, simplify what we know and that you can in fact teach people in a very simplistic way how to do active listening and empathetic work and do it and teach them this in a very short period of time, and they can be, in fact, quite effective. So, it's also admitting that, is that they don't have to come and talk to me the professional in my office. In fact, I can train this school teacher or this nurse or this other person or just this peer, uhm, where this mother in a, in a school, I can teach them how to do these things and in fact, they can quite effectively do this. 

00:33:05
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:33:05
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:33:05
ALLEN IVEY It sounds pretty clear. 

00:33:05
The counselor needs to be out in the community 

00:33:05
ALLEN IVEY  Now, in terms of, one thing we certainly observed here is getting out in the community, outside of your professional role. 

00:33:20
NANCY BARON Hmm. 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah, what are your thoughts about that? 

00:33:20
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah, ah, but are you, do you still stay away from the communities or do you go and enter into the communities where, where you feel it? 

00:33:30
NANCY BARON It, it depends on getting where I, where I am. I mean, I, I try to enter the communities as much as possible particularly because I have to understand the communities the best that I can. Uhm, the thing that I always say when I work and that, that I always begin almost every training program that I'm in with, with, uhm, I am an expert on mental health, on counseling on this and that. I am not an expert on the culture in which I am. The culture, if I'm in Uganda or if I'm in Cambodia, the people I'm training who are Cambodians or Ugandans, they are the experts on that culture. All I can do is teach them ideas and teach them techniques and then I expect them to teach me how it's going to impact or how's gonna fit into the culture and then I expect them to change a lot of what I teach them and modify it to suit the culture that we're in. So, I do have to join these communities as best I can but I'm always an outsider. I mean, in Uganda, I am always the, you know, the only white woman walking down the streets. In Cambodia, I'm always the only western woman, you know, sitting in those camps. I mean, I'm very obvious and it's very clear who I am so I can never enter those communities and I can never understand at the level in which the people I'm training can understand what's really going on there no matter how hard they try. 

00:34:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, so, one of the reasons I've asked that question is that, ah, as I see, ah, some of my friends are getting out of the office, we get out into the community and eventually- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
ALLEN IVEY - you start getting your referrals from the community. 

00:34:55
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
ALLEN IVEY You start developing that work- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
ALLEN IVEY - or if you sit in your office, you never develop relationship- (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:35:00
ALLEN IVEY - and you never get referrals from, ah, people who are culturally different from you. 

00:35:05
NANCY BARON That's right. 

00:35:05
ALLEN IVEY So, getting out in the community seems to be vital- (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
NANCY BARON That's right. 

00:35:05
ALLEN IVEY - at the same time, realizing that communities are not gonna have to teach you. 

00:35:10
NANCY BARON That's right. 

00:35:10
ALLEN IVEY And you gotta be open. 

00:35:10
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
ALLEN IVEY I mean, that may take a period of time. 

00:35:15
NANCY BARON Uh hmm. And it's very hard and hurt being out in those communities. I mean, it's not the same as in your office. 

00:35:20
Trauma issues and stories 

00:35:20
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, when you get stories of, you do much have stories of severe trauma? 

00:35:30
NANCY BARON Yeah, I, I did. We, we do many stories in many different kinds and that, in Sri Lanka, uhm, the, one of the major stories that kept getting told to me was the story, of course, of death and particularly, death of, uhm, parents and in particular, death of fathers. In Sri Lanka, there is a time when someone we won't politically get into who but someone came in and took many thousands and thousands of men out of villages and killed them all. We've got villagers that are all widows, uhm, and so, we've got many, many situations where, uhm, women are trying desperately to bring up children alone. In these communities, uhm, what I found was that many of these women, they just didn't know what to do. Uhm, they had no idea how to talk to the children about death. They were, in fact, uhm, avoiding it. And I had some situations where father had been dead for years and years already but mother was still not telling children. So, what I did is I, I developed, uhm, a story around that scenario and I started it orally and working with groups, widows groups in particular, with that story. What I found is that I got a very, very good response. It was a story of an animal, you know, a little elephant, uhm, and the need for, uhm, him to be able to build his courage in order to help take care of his mother because his father had, uhm, died, and so, died in, in conflict and violence. And so, uhm, again, when I told it orally, I found that I was getting this tremendous response so I've wrote the Children's Book. Uhm, and the Children's Book was this story, uhm, that- (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
ALLEN IVEY  Here's the book. 

00:37:05
NANCY BARON - and here's the book. And this is the little elephant. Uhm, that when the story was first developed, again, it was developed orally, uhm, that I only decided to do it in written form when I realize that other people were now using and telling my story, uhm, and that in fact, it was becoming a grand, uhm, kind of a grand story in, in Sri Lanka so, I decided I'd better put it into a book. And so, basically, it's the story of, you know, a, a happy little elephant, right? And the idea is that there's this happy little elephant and his father, ah, goes out to try to, ah, help animals who are fighting with each other. Uhm, and when the father leaves, it leaves mama who is pregnant and the baby alone. Uhm, and the war gets worse and mother and baby are left alone. They wait and wait and wait and of course, father doesn't return. Mother becomes very weak and so, the little elephant sets off, uhm, to find help for his mother and to find them, in particular, food. We start with the real basics. And so, it's the story of the adventures of the little elephant, asking the other animals for help. Uhm, some of the animals help him. Some of the animals don't. Some of the animals taunt him, uhm, and we, we have a very, very frustrated little elephant who finally is helped by, uhm, a heron who brings him to a herd of other elephants who were living in a camp and they take care of him. And then this big elephant, we call him the uncle elephant, talks to the little elephant and tell, explains to him that the little elephant's father has died and he died trying to save other animals. And now, what we begin with talking about, is the idea that the little elephant, of course is, you know, very, very much in pain and, and, and we talked about his grief and the understanding of the permanence of death, uhm, and the patience of the big elephant in trying to help the little elephant to deal with his, his grief. We deal with the idea of memories, and the big elephant explains to the little elephant that his father will always be alive in his memories. Uhm, and so, we show, the book shows the support of an adult to the little elephant, that the necessity of the little elephant to have courage in order to deal with. Uhm, and the book ends with the herons going and finding the mother and bringing the mother back to the little elephant. And it ends with the elephant and his mother living within the elephant community, on living communities. Now, so, this book was developed, uhm, primarily for these war widows to be able to explain to their children about the loss of their father. At the same time, initially, we did it with war widows. We would sit with the war widows and we would share the book, and then we would have it, them share it with their children. Is that what we found when we did that was the war widows gained tremendously, the kids gained tremendously. But it then became a very close knit group of war widows. Now, that is its benefits, but we decided it wasn't enough benefit and that we felt that we could do community work with, with the book, uhm, and that would be the more successful. So, what we did is we, uhm, developed a project where, uhm, I trained many, many staff, uhm, through war zones and camps all through Sri Lanka. And what they would do is they would go in and they would bring the community together, uhm, the only adults, men and women, community leaders. We'd get community permission. We'd sit down and we talk about the idea of communication and courage. We would then read the book with the adults. And the adults, uhm, it was fascinating because you never know how an adult's gonna respond to what we think as a children's book. To them, it wasn't a children's book because it was the story of their lives. And I'll never forget the very first work, the very first workshop we did, a very old lady raised her hand and looked at me and said, "I didn't know elephants had the same lives as us." 

00:40:50
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:50
NANCY BARON It's beautiful. I mean, and so, that they, they understood and they were touched by the story and we would, what would happen from it, it was a very non-threatening way to talk about their experiences. They could talk about the little elephant's experiences and then slowly they would talk about their own. The adults would do this together. There are lots of tears, there's a lot of support of each other, there's lots of talking together. And then, because our goal was the empowerment of families, not the empowerment of social workers or, or therapists or counselors. It was empowerment of families. Uhm, we wanted very much to help these families to maintain their unity which is what, it's so, important in, in Sri Lanka and so many of these, these countries. And so, what would happen is, we would sent the parents home with the books and the parent would sit with their own child, share the story of the book, and then we had, uhm, a special, ah, training manual for parents. So, the parents would then have questions they could ask their children and a way to talk to their children about the storybook. What we found is that, it was an instant way, a very uncomplicated instant way of allowing a parent and a child to talk about these issues. They talked about death, they talked about grief, they talked about communication, feelings, courage. The book elicited that as an automatic response. Uhm, so, it was a very simplified way of getting people to do these things. It was also that we gave the people credit for common sense. We knew that these were good families. We knew that they were not families looking to us for this kind of assistance, accepting that they had suffered some of the most horrible traumas. They didn't need long-term therapy. They didn't need long-term counseling. What they needed was the impetus to do this kind of work on their own and that's exactly what they did. Is that the families, on their own, use the book as the impetus, to build this courage, talk about the issues. And then we would go back again a week later, bring the adults together again and ask what happened with the children, and the adults would share the stories. At that point, very difficult to keep the children away. The children will all come as well, even though that wasn't the goal. And that we would often then have full communities where everybody would come together and they would talk, about their experiences, when we'd be there three times, and that was it. And it, and that was okay to be it. First of all, because we're dealing in war zones, huge numbers of people who worked with 20,000 families which is about, at least, a hundred thousand children. Uhm, so, we had huge numbers to work with and we weren't dealing with people who were, uhm, non-functional. They're quite functional but they had this kind of issue that, that needed to be addressed, uhm, and so that's what we did. Uhm, and so the issue was addressed and it was addressed within family and community settings. The children would then take these books and they still take them to school. It's also used as a reading book in all the schools coz the kids of course have copies of the books, uhm, and the project goes on and on and on. Books last forever, you know? So, it's, ah, a self help tool that's forever. The big joke in Sri Lanka is that the little elephant book sits in mud huts or in huts in the middle of nowhere in Muslim families next to the Koran and the Hindu families next to the Shiva gods. I mean, this is the only other possession that they have besides these, uhm, religious possessions. That's all. 

00:44:10
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. A wonderful treat- (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
NANCY BARON Yeah, yeah. 

00:44:10
ALLEN IVEY - for you to have done that further. 

00:44:15
We as helpers are honored to hear client stories 

00:44:15
NANCY BARON A thrill, well, a thrill for me to watch something be effective that you'd never really, weren't sure, we weren't sure. And I was just very fortunate that I had a wonderful staff and, uhm, I had foreign governments that were willing to give us the money to purchase these books. Uhm, so that was a real blessing and we're really very, very lucky. 

00:44:35
ALLEN IVEY So, one of the extensions occurs here in the States would be the use of a book like this or other books- (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:44:40
ALLEN IVEY - to those. I think the thing that you're adding, which is particularly different, is sending the books home with the parents. You have, or, or groups of parents that have common problems. 

00:44:50
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:44:50
ALLEN IVEY In effect, then the parents read the child, the book of the child. It serves as a way for the parent and child- (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:44:55
ALLEN IVEY - to communicate in any ways. 

00:44:55
NANCY BARON Exactly. 

00:44:55
ALLEN IVEY And, or tend to your surprise for adults to communicate in new ways. 

00:45:00
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:45:00
Conclusion 

00:45:00
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, so I put together exactly from what you were saying is, uhm, communicating through the other- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
ALLEN IVEY - to bring the, to bring the message home. I heard you correctly there? 

00:45:15
NANCY BARON Yes. 

00:45:15
ALLEN IVEY  Now, what would you, ah, as we're coming here and march from the end, ah, what might you like to add? Ah, what do you think is the most important from your experience as you like to share- (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
NANCY BARON Hmm. 

00:45:30
ALLEN IVEY - as in your, as we conclude. 

00:45:30
NANCY BARON  Yeah, the most important from my experience, uhm, hmm, that's a very hard question. I, I think that, I feel like I've been very lucky, uhm, to be able to live abroad and to be able to work in environments in which I worked. I, I feel that, uhm, I have learned so much by being outside of the United States and within environments where I am both a minority, where my ideas are the minority, uhm, that I think I, I left here feeling like a knew a lot more than I've come back knowing, uhm, because I, I feel that, I feel like I've very humbled, uhm, in very much learning that, ah, the ideas and attitudes we have here are not the only ideas and attitudes. There are many different ways to behave and many different ways to think and feel. And so, uhm, I think in many ways I feel that I've, I've been offered the opportunity by being in so many foreign countries to reexamine, uhm, myself and my own environment. 

00:46:25
ALLEN IVEY  That serve I'm reminded of Henry David, ah, Thoreau's words, "Simplify, simplify." 

00:46:35
NANCY BARON Yeah. 

00:46:35
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, through what you've been saying, we find mostly in very basic skills courses in counseling- (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
NANCY BARON  Yes, exactly. 

00:46:45
ALLEN IVEY - and complicate ourselves with theories. And you can add that some very important and useful ideas. 

00:46:50
NANCY BARON  Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
ALLEN IVEY I'll give you the last word. 

00:46:55
NANCY BARON I think you're right. I see, think, simplify, simplify and for all of us to be humble in understanding that, uhm, helping other people is very basic, you know, and that we all started. I, I think most of us have started in this profession from the heart and then we get chained or we kind of moved off into theory. I hope that what happens then is that after we get all this theory, we come back to our hearts. And I think that what I, I feel that we do most in the work that I'm doing now is that we go back to the heart and use very simple ideas with people who care about each other to try to help each other. 

00:47:30
ALLEN IVEY  Thank you very much. 

00:47:35
NANCY BARON Thank you.
