MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, my name is Matt Englar-Carlson and I'm the host of this video series on The Skills of Counseling. This program is on assessment strategies. I'd like welcome our featured expert, Dr John Sommers-Flanagan. Welcome. 

00:00:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. It's great to be here. 

00:00:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great for viewer too. Uh… Can talk about your, your approach to counseling? 

00:00:40
John Sommers-Flanagan, PhD 

00:00:40
Department of Counselor Education, University of Montana 

00:00:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, I can. Umm… You know, I think that I'm dogmatically aglectic. I really feel like… One thing that's important is for us not to expect for clients to be flexible and adapt to our approach. 

00:00:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:00:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But instead for us to be flexible and adapt to the client's needs, problems, the setting, goals, a whole range of different things. And so I feel very strongly about that. Umm…I don't use the word dogmatic uh…very often in my life. 

00:01:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I heard that it was emphatic the way you said it. 

00:01:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. I like to say, it's, you know, I'm dogmatically flexible. 

00:01:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:01:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… And, and so beyond that though, I also think that it's important to emphasize the relationship and I feel like that cuts across all different theoretical approaches. And in particular there's some research and some work on evidence based relationships that John Norcross has written about and spoken about. And I really feel like uh…some of those variables just have to pay attention to… 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm…The whole idea of the working alliances. 

00:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:01:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN For example and, and Roger's core conditions congregants, unconditional positive regard and empathic understanding and those are interpersonal variables that I feel like uh…I, I hope characterize my approach. 

00:02:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like you're saying that if, if, if the counseling with you is effective, it's gonna start with the relationship, it's gonna start with this, this connection you have with your client regardless of the theory in many ways, that the relationship is gonna be worth… 

00:02:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I do think that, that… I see that as foundational and that that's important. It's important for counselling in general, it's also important for assessment which we'll be talking about. 

00:02:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Are there other aspects in terms of…if, if the counseling is effective. What do you want to see happen? 

00:02:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I use this thing that I call the authentic purpose statement when I'm working with teenagers in particular. And what it really is, is a chance for me to speak to my purpose in the room. You know, why am I here? And I think that clients sometimes need to hear that. And so with teenagers I will say it like this often, not always, it depends on the client and it depends on the moment and the problem. Umm… But I'll say something like "My goals are to help you with your goals" as long as they are legal and healthy. So I have that caviar because one time I said it and the guy asked me if I help him be a better drug dealer. And I said, no, and he got upset and left. So… 

00:03:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well, we all have our needs. Right? 

00:03:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So, so really my, my main hope for an outcome is that the clients goals are, are met. Umm… But, of course that being said, there's also umm…I can't, I be lying if I didn't admit that I did…I have some values. I have some things that I think are important uh…and I think social interest is important. 

00:03:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:03:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know that kind of connection in a personally empathy. Uh… I think egalitarian and respectful relationships are important. I, I think those are good goals for people to have in counselling. Of course I'm not gonna force that on people, but I think that they are good. I think self-control, self management, umm…those are important things to strive for. Umm… And, you know, and I think that uh… symptom reduction, uh…happiness. 

00:04:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So a lot of people actually feel happier and, and see progress. 

00:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I think those are important. But, you know, I would also say, sometimes I think those, we put those on the front burner when really a life well lived. That is characterized by good decision making skills, another basic thing that we can help people with in counseling. 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And many ways if they make those good decisions any way the other symptoms will be reduced and they should, they should follow. 

00:04:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Should. 

00:04:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:04:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And nobody can be happy all the time right. And I think that's an important thing to acknowledge. So I do have some values, some things that I think are important goals. I don't really want to force them on clients, but they are in the back of my mind most the time. 

00:04:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, John, it really seems like again this notion of being egalitarian, being connected with the client, being, being collaborative, that these are values that, that are important to you and they really show through the way that, that you hope to work. 

00:05:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I hope they do. Yeah. That is my goal. And, you know, sometimes people… Everyone is different. Everyone is unique. And I certainly wouldn't want to say that I can connect with anybody, uh…but I feel like, I work hard to do that and to have a good counseling relationship. 

00:05:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. You mentioned earlier that, you know, you also, you know, you're in the room for a reason, you have some skills. And I wonder about in, in doing outcome measures… Do you use up the measures? Do you, do you assess the client as it goes on to kind of show that what the work you're doing actually is effective? 

00:05:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a great question. And I know right now there's a strong movement towards doing more and more of that. And I certainly have used outcome measures uh… in particular if it's a specific symptom, I might use the… For, for depression I might use the back depression inventory, second edition. And I might also use the… If it's more broad based, the OQ, the Outcome Questionnaire-45. If I'm working with young people, maybe the YOQ, The Youth Outcome Questionnaire. Maybe the child behavior checklist to try to get the parents to rate how their children are doing also because if I'm working with a family system, a child and some parents or caregivers, then it's really important for the parents and the caregivers to see progress. If they don't then counseling will stop rather quickly. Umm… So I've used those. But I also have to say that umm… I've had some clients who just, they don't like doing questionnaires. And I can't say that I blame them. So I'm not gonna force that. If they don't want to do it, then I'm happy not to do it also. 

00:06:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, those are examples of some, some kind of preexisting kind of measures and an assessment, someone if you do, do any kind of session, the session assessments or do you talk to your clients in terms of how, how they think the work is going, if, if, if that's valid as well? 

00:07:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think this session rating scale is a interesting thing to use incorporate. Uh…I do feel like he can do that formally with the session rating scale or the SRS. Or, you know, do it less formally just by saying, hey, Matt, how do you think our work is going? And I feel like, that is important to do. Umm… I don't want to be heading down a road that my client is not benefiting from or feel uncomfortable with. 

00:07:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And my hunch is that also kind of builds back that notion of being, being collaborative with the client, right? That the client also has a say and how things are going and which they have to give you feedback, right? 

00:07:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. As we talk today, I'll probably use the word collaborative over and over again. 

00:07:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:07:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But I do feel like it is important for us to be collaborative. Now I am familiar with some people who are kind of radical collaborationists, you know, and they say that the counselor should never be the expert. Well, you know, I think we have to be the expert sometimes. That we have to be the expert in being collaborators, right? So… And so that we know how to uh… give people an invitation for collaboration for example. 

00:08:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. That make sense. So can you give us a bit information about how you came to be a counselor and your background and how you got to where you are? 

00:08:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I, I love to. I've, I've a memory. Umm… It's not an early recollection. 

00:08:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's a later recollection. Umm…I was a junior at the Oregon State University. I had gone to a community college first. 

00:08:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… my life had been really all about athletics and focused on sports and I was in Oregon State and still doing some sports but umm… I had to declare a major. 

00:08:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, that stuff. 

00:08:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I was a junior. They made me. Umm… And I declared psychology and uh… and then later… Late in my junior year, I took a pre practicum class and my professor's name was Tom Murphy, Thomas Murphy. Uh…He was a Native American and he had us do counseling sessions with each other in front of the class. So we kind of build up to it. Learn some listening skills and then… And so I had my day umm…when I was gonna perform in front of a class. And my partner who was gonna be my client got in a bicycle accident. Somebody opened a door while she was biking and she hit it. It wasn't a terrible and she wasn't terribly injured, she was shock. Uh… she was upset, she was angry uh… and she arrived. And so it was odd. It was… It became … 

00:09:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It was real. 

00:09:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Real. 

00:09:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Yeah. 

00:09:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And I just I remember trying to use my best uh… counseling skills from the class. And I just got really good feedback and I remember thinking uh… I might be able to do this. Yeah. So a little, a pivotal moment I think. Uh… After that I went on and got my PhD umm…and I got in clinical psychology from the University of Montana. And it was an eclectic program. We had a psychoanalytic, hypno analytic professor, we had a cognitive therapist, better behavior therapist. We had an existentialist, we had a person centered guy. 

00:10:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So the full range. 

00:10:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Full range. Everybody had their, their niche umm… and I really appreciated that more in retrospect at the time obviously. 

00:10:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That time (inaudible ) somewhat confusing and they kind of learned all these different ways of thinking. 

00:10:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It was a little confusing to put all I see out there. 

00:10:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then I did… Uh… I've volunteered to help a guy with this dissertation and I learned uh…about collaborative assessment, which was a kind of approach to assessment that a woman named Constance Fisher had developed and it was pretty darn cool. And, and, you know, all of my training experiences I, I think back, they were imperfect. And I was an imperfect student. But overall I did manage to take advantage of and learn from some, some really amazing people over the years. 

00:10:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. So it sounds like, again there's, there's a lot of influences and sounds like, almost like, some plan happenstance, happen along the way. Which their, right place at the right time. Maybe it looks like it was random and at sometimes your previous experiences kind of got you set up for the next one. 

00:11:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. There you have to do some things to get in the right place for the right things to happen. And I feel like that happened for me and I was really lucky in a lot of ways, fortunate to have the mentors that I had. 

00:11:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. And I know in your role now you, you're counsel educator and, and your trained counselors. What are some of the most important kind of areas or things that you want to make sure that the counselors in training can learn about and, and develop? 

00:11:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I have a few strong feelings about that. 

00:11:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I'm assuming you do. Start. 

00:11:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know the first one is, I, I think that counselors, counseling students in my expectations, I try to make them clear is that… You know, you need to be able to listen non-directively. You need to be able to do some form of the Carl Rogers stuff. 

00:11:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:11:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And if you can't do that, If you can at least shift into it some times, then you might want to think about it different profession. And, and I know that sounds… I mean, I, I think about that. I, I wrote it down. Umm… I… And I think uh… that's a strong statement, uh…but I really believe it. And it's not… I don't mean that people have to be person centered all the time. But if they can't shift into really being with the person in the room and where the person is, then I think they could be an educator, they could be something else but maybe not a counselor. So that's one thing. 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… Another thing is open to supervision. 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Open to learning. 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… If they are not, I feel like, well, what is the point of wanting to learn this. 

00:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:12:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN None of us become perfect counselors. We all should be thinking about how we can continue to grow and development, and, and develop, not development, but… umm… 

00:12:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Do you mean… So we leave that over to supervision. Do you mean kind of non-defensive, when I look at oneself, uh…when we take feedback…. 

00:12:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. All that. 

00:12:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And not just feedback from me. I mean, even though obviously sometimes I think I'm right or I have good feedback for a student. I just want them to be open to learning because we, we shouldn't be thinking we… Oh, I know the best way to be. 

00:13:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Oh, certainly as a student you get feedback from all kinds of people all the time. Some gets the same and some gets the opposite. You have to learn how to kind of take it in and to make sense of it. So… 

00:13:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:13:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so also I think people should be umm… They should… I, I love theories, but I love techniques. And I think people should understand theory and understand the techniques to go with them. And to be able to say, if I stop our video recording and supervision and I say, Matt, what do you doing? And I'm gonna try to say that in a nice way. I don't want to make people defensive. But I let students know ahead of time, I'm going to ask that because I want you to have a sense of what you're doing and why. 

00:13:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So some intention. It sounds like intentionality. Okay. 

00:13:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I have an old professor who used to say don't fly by the seat of your paints. I don't know what that even means but, to have a sense of direction. And we might disagree on what that is but you know, that's a good place to start. And then the last thing I would say and it's certainly not the last thing or the only things. But uh…I, I like students to have a sense about research and science. I don't want to be (inaudible ). I use that word respectfully. But I also want them to not be scientific fundamentalists. So I want them to have a balance in that area too, to respect the science. And what we know about counseling and psychotherapy. But the same time, to be open to their intuition, to be able to recognize that there are way different, many different ways of knowing and that we need to be open to that. Uh… I feel like both of those are important. I guess, I'm preaching a balance. 

00:14:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So it's called that notion of, kind of being like a science practitioner, understanding that our field has a base. Uh…and learning how to apply that base, maybe through each person in the populations of these… 

00:15:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You are really good paraphrase they got. You got it. 

00:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Umm… So we're like a counselor, you know, counsel is a process. And in this video program, we're looking at that second stage which, which calling assessment. Uh… Would you consider assessment? 

00:15:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, assessment is everywhere all the time. 

00:15:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:15:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… Even right now you're assessing me, I'm assessing you. 

00:15:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:15:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… sometimes I'm assessing myself, you know. Thinking… Oh, did I just say something that sounded not so good? Right. And so it's happening all the time. And so uh…what is assessment? You know, it's observation. Could be, I listen to somebody, could be I saw some kind of nonverbal observation. Could be somebody filled out a questionnaire. I look at the results. And then from there we used to say, observation inference, right? And, then we make judgments about that. I think it's really important for us to go observation and then for us to build hypotheses. Uh… Stanley Sue, a multi-cultural psychologist talked about umm… how we need to be use scientific mindedness and I feel like that's really important. We make observations, we make hypotheses that then we collaboratively evaluate for accuracy. And so I might say to you. So I've noticed this about you wondering if that seems to fit. And then you say yes or no or it does fit a little bit in these situations and we refine it together. And then in the end, in terms of… If it's a good assessment, if it fits you and we can apply it to make a good case formulation and treatment plan. 

00:16:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like again you're collaborative with the client's but again, but it's, it's all to the purpose of kind of making that assessment sharper and sharper with the more information that we get. Uh… So then that leads to a treatment plan that's probably more appropriate. 

00:16:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:17:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The goodness of fit I think is important. And uh…it's, it's really hard to achieve that unless I get some feedback from the client right about whether or not my observations are accurate. 

00:17:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So when you talk about this… The process of assessment is an ongoing thing. It's, it's moment to moment. 

00:17:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:17:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And then are there other periods where it's more formal? 

00:17:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:17:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And of course beginning and end of counseling is traditionally where it's more formal, uh… where we want to do uh… precession measure and outcome measure. And as you mentioned before, we also might want to do periodic ratings, maybe at certain points in counseling. Umm… I've used the, you know, the BDI, every session with people who have a diagnosis of major depression and I want to monitor that. And I know I can do that assessments interpersonally in, in the counseling session. But it's, it's somewhat efficient to get that information and to have it. And so that if there's a worse score, uh… more depression, then I can know where to focus and how to get there quickly. 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like… Again you're using information, you're gathering information and there's moments in which you, you want information kind of monitor, kind of progress. 

00:18:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:18:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… and I'm wondering aspects around like some of suicidal as well, as that a period assessment as well that you're true. 

00:18:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. Yes. 

00:18:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, absolutely. Umm… And one of the things I'm gonna demonstrate is using a scaling system later to evaluate for suicidality. And of course there are standardized psychometric measures for assessing suicide uh…and there's, there are risk factors that we should check. But I feel like the interpersonal uh… process of evaluating for suicide is the, really the, the most important process because it leads right in to counseling. 

00:18:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Okay. I mean, I, I guess some people might believe that, that assessment is the most important stage of counseling, but you see it that way or…? 

00:19:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well this is a session. This… That's what I'm focusing on for, for this particular video. So I think it…. No. 

00:19:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Of course it is right. 

00:19:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Of course. 

00:19:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:19:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… No, I don't think it's the most important. Uh… It's hard to even identify the most important because it's such a big package with different parts. Uh…I would certainly not put it above the therapeutic relationship. 

00:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. As I was thinking as they built on that so… 

00:19:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I think good assessment is. 

00:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. So when you do assessment and you're in that process again, whether it's the moment to moment or the more formalized… What are some keys to success uh…when working with clients at this stage? 

00:19:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… Another great question and I think umm…collaboration. 

00:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Collaboration. 

00:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:19:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But also focusing on strengths. 

00:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh…a lot of times and over the years I think as umm….mental health professionals, we have maybe focused too much on problems. Problem, problem, problem, problem. You know, there's not as much focus on health and wellness. Now that's one great thing about council education is that there is a stronger focus on wellness. I think sometimes it's hard for us to figure out how to do it, even though we're trained in it in counselor education. Uh… But I would say that by collaborating and by focusing on strengths that really is something that's gonna make the assessment more effective. 

00:20:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's… I mean, that's true because I mean most of our clients will come in and talk about what's going wrong. Uh… but the idea being that we've the strengths so we can use the kind of create better treatment, also again, possibly the better happiness and that maybe leads to actual mental health, you know, as a mental health counselor, not as an illness counselor. 

00:20:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. I don't even use the term mental illness. It's out of my vocabulary. 

00:20:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it seems like in many ways we're so focused on that as well and that, that counseling does (inaudible ) an opportunity to kind of figure out what is going right. 

00:21:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. And, you know, clients want to talk about their problems sometimes. And so I, I'm not a… I wouldn't put myself in that solution focused counseling camp, like I never speak of problems. 

00:21:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:21:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Clients want to talk about problems. It gives me an opportunity to be empathic. It's a natural part of the process. But I do feel like another good part of assessment is, how do we transform the problem into a goal? Something that's not just pushing them to get better, but polling them to get better. 

00:21:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That sounds like and… That point again will be a shared pulling, that it has done well, the relationship is built appropriately, that, that pulling it shared amongst, (inaudible ) you and the client. 

00:21:43
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I mean, I think, this is where the whole concept of working alliance is really very useful because you have a relationship bond. You know, you and I are connected. And then we collaboratively identify goals. And then we engage in some tasks interactively and mutually in counseling that are designed to take us from the problems to the goals. And those tasks can be uh…wide variety of different things. But if they make some good sense and they connect to the goals, then we can work on them together. 

00:22:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that make sense, that make sense. So how do you… You know you probably see a wide range of clients. How do you tailor your suggestions, your assessments to each client and are there some assessments you do with all clients or there are some you might just use with certain clients or certain types of clients? 

00:22:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And there are times when you can get some precession information. You know, you might get that from a referral source, so that I know some things about the client ahead of time. 

00:22:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:22:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I try not to do too much of that because it can really bias me before the person even walks in the room. But if there's some information out there that I should have, I should have it so… Umm… You may be aware the fact that I'm a fan of the clinical interview. 

00:22:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:22:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the clinical interview is really an assessment interview. Sometimes we talk about it as an intake interview. And so as a part of that process umm… I try to evaluate three things consistently. 

00:23:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN More or less across all clients. 

00:23:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the first one is, get a sense of the first areas problems. What are the problems and what are the goals associated with those problems? So that's area number one or step one. Second thing is to talk about the past and the person. So who is this person in the room with me? And the psycho social history or bio psycho social spiritual history and that can help us to, to figure out who is this person and over time because there's often continuity between who the person was in the past. Certainly at the very minimum, this continuity and the symptoms from the past to the symptoms of the present, every current set of symptoms has a history. So I got to go back there at least that far. 

00:23:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON With this part also include like… It sounds like an assessment of, maybe the personality, but also maybe the cultural identity and how that's kind of changed and… 

00:23:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:23:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Totally and uh…obviously cultural identity is, is huge. And some people umm….will have that identity shift over time, but the roots are still important even though they may not be completely influential in the moment but the roots can still be important of the cultural identity. 

00:24:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like it's an understanding about the past, but also kind of present in terms of what's really salient for a person…? 

00:24:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so problem… 

00:24:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:24:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Problem goals as step one. Step two is the past psycho social history and the person. And the third part is, what's happening now? What's the current situation? And so in a, in a complete intake interview, I'm gonna want to try to hit those three areas. Now if I have somebody who comes in and she's really clear on what her problem is and she wants to get right to work. We'll probably focus on the problem and goals and uh…not do a lot of history, because this is somebody who is ready to roll. Other clients just won't be as clear and so it might be important for me to get more historical information in order to do a good case formulation. 

00:25:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like there, there are times when clients are gonna come in who maybe don't really know what they want to do or they have a sense, maybe what they present which isn't really what they want to do. So how do you work with that? How do you help clients find their way? 

00:25:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And for me there are a number of different kinds of assessment techniques that help. None of them will, like, suddenly illuminate the graph, a wish. Umm…. But, you know, the, the family constellation interview, early recollections. If you're just thinking Adlerian, both of those are really helpful for exploring the… You know, the Adlerians would say, the client style of life or lifestyle or sometimes the cognitive people would say that, the cognitive map or the schema or schemata that they are using to function in the world. And so hopefully by going into the past and exploring using some techniques, I can get clearer on what the nagging problem is. And the Adlerians would call it a basic mistake. And… uh…but the cognitive people would say that this is a uh… it's a cognition problem, maybe cognitive distortions and that they are consistently seeing things that are not quite adaptive. So… 

00:26:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Would, would that be different for the other set of clients, those clients who come in and kind of say, I know exactly what I want to work on. I have no problematically in my problem. Would you still go back and do some of this earlier assessment? 

00:26:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, it depends. 

00:26:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:26:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, one of the things that uh…is in John Norcross's book about evidence based relationships is the… Some of the factors that seem to be associate with positive outcomes and one is client preference. 

00:26:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:26:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so I, you know, I, I may just go with the client's preference. Uh…and if the client wants to just focus on the problems, we'll start there. That doesn't mean that there, maybe they will double back and we'll find that. Oh, let's do a little more history. Uh…And, and that will be… That would be a really useful thing if the client comes to that. But it's hard for me to say, you should do a history if it's just not relevant to the client. 

00:27:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So it sounds like, John, you have a process that you work with that you can insert clients into that process depending on the kind of where they are, what the readiness to change, all these kind of things. And so and that's part of the clinical interview and… 

00:27:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:27:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So if all that goes well… 

00:27:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:27:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What… What would you have accomplished in the end? 

00:27:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hoof. 

00:27:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hoof. 

00:27:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A miracle happens and the person is all better. Now umm… I'd say that what happens is, we've got a good case formulation and a, a treatment plan that fits the client and fits the particular unique aspects of the client's problem and the client's life. So that's what I would hope for. 

00:28:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, John, what I'm hearing you talk about is that, this stage is really critical because it helps us really understand our clients, it helps to understand how to work with them in a way that, that's appropriate and effective. And if you do that early assessment and kind of understand where they are in the other stages of counseling, then kind of go down a path that is probably much or tailored what the, the client actually wants? 

00:28:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. And I, I really feel like, you know, goodness of fit very important. And I think about that in terms of case formulation and treatment plan. And so we need to on, have an ongoing modification of that, if it turns out, we're three or four or five sessions in and it's, it's not fitting perfectly, that's the beauty of the progress monitoring, right? I'm checking in. Umm… It seems like, we want to make an adjustment and head a little different direction. So… So, yeah. 

00:29:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So umm… In just a moment we're gonna watch you work. We're gonna see you apply different interventions and, and different strategies, they kind of see what all these things look like. And so I'm, I'm excited. 

00:29:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm excited too. I'm a little bit, a little bit frightened. I'd be lying if I didn't say that. 

00:29:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Great. 

00:29:20
Assessment Strategies 

00:29:20
Assessment of Client's Strengths/ Focusing on What's Going Right 

00:29:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, often we do assessment. It seems like we really focused on problems. It seems like most of the assessments out there are based on your depression or anxiety or anger or something like that. Umm…kind of really what's not going well with clients. Why would we look at assessing client strengths? 

00:29:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, strengths are part of what clients can use to solve their problems. And, you know, all clients have some strengths and sometimes they're not aware of them, sometimes they are, but in either case, we, if we can identify those strengths, we might be able to capitalize on those and use those to help manage or reduce the problem or the symptoms. 

00:30:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So at, at what point in, in counseling or assessment might you do a strength place assessment? 

00:30:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know anytime. 

00:30:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:30:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I think certainly at the beginning. And especially if it's with somebody who, you know, Jerome Frank used to say that uh…what brings people to counseling is that they are demoralized, they are feeling distressed, they have problems and they are demoralized because they can't seem to solve them. Uh… And when people are demoralized, I think it's important for us to do things that are encouraging and that help people get lifted up and so… So yeah, I think that's an important time umm… 

00:30:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like there's, there's, there's, there's, there's (inaudible ) knowing that about, you're actually assessing this thing because you want to use them to help clients get better, but (inaudible ) like a, like a secondary thing of actually kind of maybe raising their spirits, encouraging them, recognizing things, where you are as bad as, as they thought or maybe other… They are just not looking other things are going well. 

00:31:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Right. And of course the term that Adler used was discouraged, right? And so that we need to help them regain some courage to face the life problems or life tasks that they have. You know one thing when I was in grad school and I was learning about Constance Fisher's collaborative assessment approach, we would give people the MMPI, The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which is all about assessing pathology. Right, psychopathology. And but we learned how to, you know, if somebody has a spike six which is the paranoia scale. We learn how to give positive feedback about that. Which I think it's a good skill and that how can we see the positive even in what people might traditionally think of as a set of negative symptoms? 

00:31:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Okay. So how do you do this? And what it give any particular techniques you like to use when, when you assess strengths? 

00:31:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you can do it implicitly, you can do explicitly. Uh…Sometimes I'll stop and I'll say, you know, we've been talking too much about problems. Can we talk about positive things, some of the strengths and some of the good times that you're having in your life? And so I might just turn the interview and focus on that. Umm…I also have an activity that I demonstrate in a moment. Uh… It's called "What's Good About You." And it's a very explicit sort of corny thing that I do. Umm… It was something that a friend of mine and I developed more doing after school groups with children with an ADHD diagnosis umm…and we found it helpful and interesting. Umm… And so there's also another technique that I like to use, which is very implicit, it's sort of behind the scenes. And it's whenever I hear a client say something about a personal strength or an adaptive behavior and I tell my students pretend you have a yellow highlighter. And when the person says, well, you know, I guess I'm pretty smart and I've been able to avoid drinking too much alcohol, whatever it is. I say get out that highlighter and say it back, now it's a metaphor. But to say, oh, so it sounds like you're saying that, you feel like you're pretty smart and that you have the good judgment not to drink too much alcohol. And it's really important for us to highlight that adaptive statement. A lot of times people forget their own adaptive statements. 

00:33:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like in a way what you also call for this is, this ability to get to hear that positivity and kind of hear those strengths when clients maybe just kind of tossing them off or just got out here this is happening. And you're gonna pull them that as a, as a point of assessment too, it sounds like. 

00:33:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I am definitely listening for problems but I'm listening for solutions and I'm listening for strength also. 

00:33:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna see you work with Omar. 

00:33:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:33:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I wonder if you can kind of set up that, this, this clip for the viewers. 

00:33:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This is a very simple straightforward procedure. And uh… it's just, I'm gonna, it's called "What's good about you?" I'm going to ask him ten times. I'll explain the activity to him and then I'm gonna ask him ten times "what's good about you?" The only big rule is, he can't use the same answer twice. 

00:34:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh…If he does then uh…I just say, okay, you can do that once and then I get him back on track. Umm… And it works differently with different people. Sometimes occasionally somebody will object and not want to do it. I don't know how comfortable Omar is gonna be with it, but we will see. 

00:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like you want us to watch for any possible, possible resistance to it. 

00:34:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:34:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… And then also kind of watch how you can kind of, kind of work with what he tells you? 

00:34:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And, and sort of get a sense for the process. Uh…and there may be times and one of the most revealing things about the process is, you know, what's Omar thinking as we do it? It's sort of like, Aaron Beck said years ago, he, when he was developing cognitive therapy that it wasn't the free association that what people were saying that was important, but it was their own personal commentary on the free association that was really valuable to focus on. And so I will try if it works out to access uh… with Omar. What were you thinking as you were saying some of these positive things about yourself? 

00:35:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. It sounds good. Let's watch. 

00:35:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. Thanks. Omar, we know each other a little bit. I guess in this process of counseling there are a lot of different ways to get to know people. And one of the things that I would like to do with you is an activity. 

00:35:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:35:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And it's an activity where I'm gonna ask you the same question ten times. 

00:35:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:35:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Your job is to just give the best answer you can each time. So it's the same question and one rule is you cannot use the same answer twice. 

00:35:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:35:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? 

00:35:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:35:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. So are you ready? 

00:35:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yes. 

00:35:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, here's the question. I'm gonna write him down. Uh… And then afterwards I'll just give them to you because you will have generated the answers. 

00:35:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:35:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So the question is "what's good about you?" 

00:36:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh…. See, I would say… Open minded. 

00:36:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So you're open minded? 

00:36:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… 

00:36:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:36:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Patient. 

00:36:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Patient. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:36:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Resilient. 

00:36:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Resilient? Having trouble spelling that, but I understand. I do my best. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:36:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA I'm adaptive. 

00:36:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Adaptive. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:36:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA The good sense of humor. 

00:37:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I have a good sense of humor. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:37:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA I'd say, I'm caring. 

00:37:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm caring. Thank you. What good about you? 

00:37:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Empathetic. 

00:37:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Empathetic. Very nice. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:37:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA I would say thoughtful. 

00:37:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thoughtful? 

00:37:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… 

00:37:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think I saw you being thoughtful to stand. It's esthetic. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:37:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Adventurous. 

00:37:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Adventurous? Last one. What's good about you? 

00:38:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Let's see. Gentle. 

00:38:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Gentle. Okay. Thank you. You got to ten very quickly, very efficiently. Uh… and I would just like to take a look at some of the things that you said. And if it's okay with you, I'm gonna see if I can add one or maybe two just based on what I know about you so far. 

00:38:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:38:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So I'm gonna see if I can add one that… I don't think you have yet. Umm… And so just in our short interactions before this and during this time, my sense is that you are very sensitive, sensitive in that you perceive and notice things and you want to be, I guess, gentle and responsive to people. Would you say that's true? 

00:39:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA I would say, yeah. I would say that's true. 

00:39:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So sensitive, I'm just adding that and it's okay with you. And then another one umm… Tell me if this is right or wrong. But as you gave me these very efficient one word answers, almost all one word answers uh… patient, resilient, adaptive, empathetic, thoughtful, I thought you seemed very efficient. Does that fit? 

00:39:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:39:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:39:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, it does fit. 

00:39:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:39:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:39:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Tell me an example of how you are efficient in your life, in your work? 

00:39:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh…In my life. So when I start something, I like to see it all the way through to the best that I can. Doesn't always turn out that way, but that's what I try and strive for. 

00:39:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So you set a goal and you try to get there as efficiently as you can. 

00:40:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yes. 

00:40:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you're very serious about those goals? 

00:40:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh… Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:40:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, to an extend. 

00:40:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, for sure. 

00:40:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And so when we look at these words, open minded, patient, resilient, adaptive, good sense of humor, caring, empathetic, thoughtful, adventurous, gentle, sensitive, efficient, uh…any of them really kind of speak to you in terms of like a core value or a way that you are? 

00:40:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm…Yeah. I would say adaptive. 

00:40:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Adaptive? 

00:40:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:40:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. I mean here you are doing this. 

00:40:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Right. 

00:40:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Kind of adaptive sort of give a sense of flexibility being able to go in different directions as needed. 

00:40:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA You're right. Yeah, I think that was important as needed for sure. 

00:40:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:40:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:40:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Can you think of an example in your life of uh… when you were especially adaptive? 

00:41:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh…adaptive? Yeah, there's been many times uh… moving from a country, different country over here. I had to learn how to be adaptive to, you know, over here to America. Uh…adaptive? Uh…from working uh…40, 50 hour a week job to almost none of that and full time school… I had to completely shift my uh…values and priorities to be able to, you know, make it as far as I have this far. So I would say those are a couple examples. 

00:41:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So you have some pretty clear evidence to support the adaptive quality. 

00:41:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:41:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So and other thing that I guess sometimes is interesting as you were saying these things and I'm saying what's good about you repeatedly. Do you have any thoughts go through your mind, any thing kind of commentary in the back your mind as we're doing this? 

00:42:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Any thoughts or commentary go through my mind? Umm… I just tried to I guess maybe reflect on the person that I am now as opposed to the person that I was, you know, a while ago. 

00:42:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:42:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:42:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So you really were focusing on being here now and now and who am I now and can I give you a list of things about myself that really capture? 

00:42:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, I would say that's accurate. 

00:42:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Who I am. All right. Any of these that as you said them, you thought umm…. had some doubt or some less confidence in? 

00:42:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA No. 

00:42:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No? So all these… 

00:42:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… 

00:42:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow. 

00:42:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:42:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's great. 

00:42:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. You know, maybe thoughtful uh…because sometimes it's like, okay, I got to like really sit down and, you know think about something. If I wanted to come out like, maybe like the way I'd like it to. I'd probably say, because I tend to think a lot, but I mean I guess that also in itself makes it true, so… 

00:43:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:43:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. And I would, I would, that's pretty… 

00:43:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right and I was even struck by the fact that when you said thoughtful, it seemed like that was one of the ones that you took the most time to… Yeah. 

00:43:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:43:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:43:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

00:43:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, Omar, thank you very much for doing this and we're going to use this off and on as we work together today and in the future. 

00:43:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

00:43:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:43:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA All right. 

00:43:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thanks. 

00:43:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Thank you. 

00:43:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, is this a good example of how to assess client strengths? 

00:43:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This is one way. 

00:43:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:43:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And like I said we talked about before. There are many different ways. Uh…you know, some people now contemporary therapist will just use a brief strengths questionnaire, perhaps you can take it online. And then they can talk about it in counseling. Umm… And a lot of times somebody might send somebody home with the homework assignment and make a list of ten good qualities about yourself. Now with Omar, I'm doing it one on one. It's an interpersonal process. And uh… I'm always fascinated with the different way that people respond to this interpersonal process (inaudible ). 

00:44:11
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And how do you assess his response to it? 

00:44:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, I, at the end at the couple of complements or positive qualities. 

00:44:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Right. Right. 

00:44:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm…And I think one of the words I used was efficient. And uh…he… To be, to be honest, it was a little surprising to me, how efficiently he said ten positive things about himself. Almost all of them are one word attributes, characteristics about himself. 

00:44:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:44:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Really quite impressive that he would focus in and be that articulate, boom, boom, boom, boom. Uh…most people don't get to ten quite that efficiently. 

00:44:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You know, it's interesting, earlier you kind of said, when you asked this, these questions to clients, you want to access kind of how they are making sense of what they are saying. 

00:45:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:45:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And I was… You did the same thing. 

00:45:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:45:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You, you made sense of what Omar was saying and then you gave him feedback. Is that normal? 

00:45:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, it's interesting. I mean, I, I find that uh… you know, since I kind of invented this procedure…. 

00:45:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Whatever, whatever… Anyway you want to do it's normal for you… 

00:45:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Umm…But I found a number of years ago that umm… And I think about this is outside in versus inside out. 

00:45:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A lot of times very supportive therapists will say, you know, Matt, you're good at this. You are… I really like this. Oh, you impressed me when you said that. Can I give you a compliment at this? And so I might as a counselor give you a lot of positive feedback outside in, right, and that's important. 

00:45:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:45:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This is a process and we got to see Omar accomplish it or respond to it fabulously, where I'm pulling out his own view of himself. 

00:45:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:45:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And there's something pretty strong about him in there to be able to identify ten positive qualities. Now I have found it's nice to add to from the outside in just to see how he responds. 

00:46:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If he'll accept some from me. Uh…I have had some people who uh…will reject mine. They like theirs. I've had some people really hang on mine and I do think it illustrates how important it is for people to have self-esteem that's boosted from the inside out. But also we all need a little positive from the outside in too. And so I think both are important. 

00:46:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I think it's good giving here some feedback as well about know how you're experiencing him as he's doing this and giving you some additional ideas. So how would you… If you were to think forward into the process of counseling, how would you use these, these strengths in the future with Omar? 

00:46:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Umm… I keep them in mind. I give… First of all I make a copy. I give a copy to him. I keep a copy from my file. Umm…I, I then and it depends on how he's doing emotionally, but I've had people who have some down times and who are interpersonally sensitive and sometimes we will talk about… Well, how can you use this as a resource in the room? Almost always when I do this with somebody, they feel pretty good at the end. 

00:47:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And so we'll… I'll make that observation and I'll say, you know, I'm wondering if this is something you could use as a cushion to those difficult times when you're feeling down? Umm… And I wonder if there's some new ones you can generate along the way. 

00:47:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like, in some ways this is almost like a tool you're giving back to the client that they can use to kind of pull out when necessary and also possibly (inaudible ) to him and embody as part of how they see themselves? 

00:47:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And sometimes you know we'll work on something as a strength. Like if… Uh…And Omar said adaptive was maybe his best one. 

00:47:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:47:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh…And I saw him adapting to the situation right in front of me. And so when we're talking about a problem that he has, he can use his skill of being flexible and adaptive and creative and, and I think that helps him to have more hope that he can uh… conquer or get over the problem. 

00:48:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I have one other little anecdote And that is, I have worked with some young people for many years and I use this with young clients as, as young as six or eight maybe. Umm…and I had one boy I think he was age 10 when I started and 18 when I ended in. We got back out that, that list from the first or second session or whenever we did it and uh…went over as a part of the termination process. 

00:48:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

00:48:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I have found that to be really nice. It's good to do some reminiscing. It's good to look at some of the positive things that he was thinking back then and then compared it. We did it again and compared uh… it to what he was thinking in the present. 

00:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So you captured the kind of that growth and he can look at how he's used, adapted and kind of changed. 

00:48:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:48:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Great idea. 

00:49:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's a nice little bonding, emotional bonding. 

00:49:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that's true, that's true. Good. Okay. Let's move on to, to our next technique, which is called "Emotionally Focused Early Recollections." 

00:49:10
Assessment Strategies 

00:49:10
Emotionally Focused Early Recollections 

00:49:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. John, can you explain what an Emotionally Focused Early Recollection is? 

00:49:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, I can. And I should say to start that I know, you know early recollections better than I do. So umm…I… 

00:49:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But, but the emotionally focus part caught me. Yeah. Yeah 

00:49:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, it's a little variation and I have uh…I have, I've just learned to use it in particular with people who have umm…anger issues. 

00:49:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:49:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And the reason that I use it is because it takes them from anger now and I try to get an example of recent anger, maybe in the last week, now. And then I try to go down, what's called uh… An old professor of my call it and affect bridge, the emotional bridge from now to then. 

00:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:50:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then I try to get an early or earliest recollection about anger. And I find that it's, uh…it's informative. It just… It helps me to get a better sense of triggers than I might get if I just explored anger in the present. And there are some classic triggers and one of them is feeling like things are unfair. Right. And so I'm, I'm looking for that always in the present. But then sometimes when you go all the way back to the past and get that early recollection of an angry moment… And it could be an anger moment that the person experienced and it could be one that the person viewed in a caregiver or a parent or grandparent. And so it, then it shapes just like an adult early recollection, whether it's true or not. It, it has, it seems to be significant in terms of how the person experience his anger now. And so it just sort of fills out the whole sense of umm… what really gets this person angry. 

00:51:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like you're gonna… Then… So you're gonna ask the client about kind of current experience and then you're ask them to recall kind our earlier memories, kind of earliest memories they can aware of, of a similar experience or and then you're gonna try to kind of connect. We're gonna connect those two together with that bridge which is kind of see how the past maybe influences the present. 

00:51:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And usually what I find is, is that the past, the early recollection of an angry moment gives me a deeper sense of what the anger dynamic is for this client. 

00:51:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So you said this is a, assessment technique that you typically use around anger. When do you use it in the process of counseling? 

00:51:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN We now use it around anger. You can use it around other emotions too, because one of the interesting things about emotions is that they tend to have continuity. What made me sad when I was five? Is probably the kind of things that still make me sad today. There may be some continuity there. I find it most helpful with anger maybe because anger is a secondary emotion and then I get more depth and detail about what the primary emotion might be underlying the anger. When? You know, usually it's best probably not to explore it like the first few minutes of the session. Umm… But if anger comes up, and as the client gets comfortable talking about anger uh…and we do a, a recent example of anger… Uh…I want to look at that recent example of anger like I'm a mouse in the corner. We now want the person to tell me details. 

00:52:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:52:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so if I have time, I'm going to want to try to umm… do an assessment of all the different dimensions of the current anger episode and that will include a cognitive You know, what's a person thinking and the details of that, but physical, breathing, skin, shakiness, uh… urges to poncho. I mean, all that stuff I'm gonna wanna try to get in the present. And then I want to go back to the past and, and the, and the past gives me just a different angle at it. And a different angle I think is sometimes deeper. It helps me understand the dynamics of the anger episodes better. 

00:53:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like what you're saying is that, in the present state it's a, it's a, it's a total kind of emotional kind of assessment. You said like the, like the body, the feelings, the sensations, all of that, then there's the recall from the past in terms of what their early, earliest memories are like and then making that bridge. Do you find that clients then begin to kind of, you know, in a way gave their own insight by connecting the past with the present or uh… 

00:53:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, and I will ask the client umm… Do you see any similarities? 

00:53:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:53:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Between the past anger episode and the present anger episode. 

00:53:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:53:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's an important connection. I can try to make interpretations. And I think the same thing would be true with the traditional earliest recollection is that, if I take up on too much responsibility for doing all the interpretation, it becomes my interpretation and it may be less, less alive for the clients. And so I want the client to be participating and saying, well, I think that this is similar. 

00:54:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:54:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm…And hopefully that we can get there. And it will just give us a different perspective on the anger. And, and, you know, Adlerian would say, insight improves motivation. 

00:54:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. So in a moment we're going to see you work with Chris. Can you set up, set up this clip for us. 

00:54:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I'm gonna do basically what I just said. And I'm going to try to get him to describe a current or a recent anger incident or episode. 

00:54:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:54:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then a minute should take him out of the past. Uh…you know, I don't know. Sometimes there's nothing there. Sometimes clients don't want to talk about an early anger incident and that's okay. Usually, almost anything can be contra indicated if the client says, I know, I'm not comfortable with that. And so we'll see. I hope that he'll go back to a past anger memory and we can link the two up and then explore him. And see, see if it informs us a little bit. 

00:55:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like we should look for kind of the, like the president, going to the past and watching the kind of bridge, bridge come together. 

00:55:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah and I will… I'll try to remember to ask him what his… If, if he sees similarities between the two. And so that will be us getting a chance to see what it seems like from his perspective. 

00:55:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Great. 

00:55:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Chris, we've been talking a little bit about what brings you in for counseling and it sounds like anger is one of the things. And uh…you have a recent example of when you felt some anger coming up inside of you? 

00:55:45
CHRIS Umm…Yeah there's probably a time last week that I remember being just so, so angry and it's being really, you know, hard headed seeing rare, just uh… kind of not having like as much control as I usually do. 

00:55:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So just in this last week. What, what was happening? What, what happened? 

00:56:00
CHRIS Well, I was having… Well, I was having fight with my boyfriend at the time. And uh…we were so sweet just going to the aquariums, just go to the beach. Uh…just to have like a fun day. And he brings a just feeling, kind of sad and I was confused because we did have a fight, you know, than I prior uh… about… So when I was talking to and he uh… didn't trust me and so he got angry about that, but then we solved it. I thought we were done. 

00:56:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You thought that was over. 

00:56:35
CHRIS So then he brings up being, still kind of sad and are you confused? And then I asked, you know, so what's going on, like what's happening? And he just doesn't have any words. And he won't say what he's feeling, he just kind of locks up. And then I started get frustrated because, you know, if you're going to ring up a fight then or bring up something that you're feeling then talk to me about it. I want to know what you're feeling, but he's not saying anything. 

00:57:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:57:00
CHRIS So I started getting frustrated and before we get to the car, I'm trying to ask him what's going on. She's not saying thing, I get frustrated. So I just leave. Uh… I, I don't know what to say, I just walk outside, umm… and I walk around the neighborhood for about ten minutes, so that I can kind of calm down a little bit. 

00:57:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Uh-huh…Okay. Well, I want to say uh… and give you a complement that it's a good thing to walk around and calm down. Do we able to calm down a little bit? 

00:57:35
CHRIS Umm…. A little bit. I mean, I said a few things that I wish I hadn't said. And I kind of punched a wall but… Umm… It's not my greatest moment, but I did kind of manage to walk outside and it took me a while. Umm… I walked around for ten minutes and I was still feeling kind of, kind of warm I guess. But I didn't want to just leave him there. So I try to come back and there's a little bit more yelling but and then… That's the second time. Umm… And that was for long and that was about 20, 30 minutes. 

00:58:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:58:05
CHRIS And then after that I came back and we kind of smooth things out I guess. So we just didn't talk about it. 

00:58:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So I want to make sure I understand the current or the recent anger situation. And so you were expecting a good time near the aquarium. Things are going fine and then you recognize that or he says that, he's still a little upset about a previous fight. You're confused. You want to process it, right? He then shuts down emotionally and that kind of pushes a button for you. 

00:58:40
CHRIS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You, you feel more angry and maybe some words you get said that are uh…. representative of that kind of anger, you take off and you walk, you punch a wall. Okay. So that's a anger situation now. Uh…I'd like you if you can to think about when in the past, maybe even the first time ever, but way back in the past, certainly before age eight or so had, did you feel that kind of anger in your body, in your, in your mind? 

00:59:20
CHRIS The earliest memory I got… The earliest memory I can have of being angry… It wasn't me being anger, it's my mom being angry. Umm… I remember that was… I think I was five at the time. 

00:59:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:59:35
CHRIS I think that's the earliest time I can remember. 

00:59:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay. And what exactly happened during that time? What was… What started the process of your mom being angry and what it looked like and then how did it end? 

00:59:50
CHRIS Umm… Well, it was kind of confusing. I remember I was in my room and I was just playing. I was just playing with my toys like, you know, I usually do. Umm…It was a Saturday. You know, favorite day in our school. Umm… And then my mom comes in and she's really angry. Uh…and I don't know why at first I'm confused. She just yelling at me. And I remember the words she said, I just drubber and just feeling like I'm oppressed by like how, how angry she was. 

01:00:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:00:20
CHRIS And then umm… she starts playing at the toys and she's yelling at me and saying that I need to clean up and I'm being too messy. And so then I start to put the toys in umm…but she's, she's still yelling and she won't stop. So umm…I start, I started crying because I didn't know what to do and I was confused. And then uh…I kind of paralyze, it kind of stuck and then uh…she like, walks away and I kind of just cry for a few minutes and then umm… that's about it, yeah. 

01:01:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Well, Chris, one of the things that umm… we think it's true about people is that sometimes some memories from the past can also uh…inform us about the kinds of things that make you angry in the present. And I don't know if you noticed, but I noticed a couple of things that were common or similar in your story from the past to the story with your boyfriend recently. Uh…did you notice any similarities? 

01:01:30
CHRIS Umm… I guess… I don't think I can think of is uh… my mom walking out, that was kind of similar. Yeah, I guess, I guess I can see that. 

01:01:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Her walking out similar to you walking out? 

01:01:40
CHRIS Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. 

01:01:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:01:45
CHRIS But I got to remember. 

01:01:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So maybe it's a pattern that you saw growing up and maybe one that you sort of have adopted. I also noticed you used the word confused both times and that you seem confused and that the anger came out of nowhere. And your, your boyfriend's being upset, sort of came out of nowhere. It was… That's not what you expected, right? 

01:02:10
CHRIS Yeah. Yeah. Actually, yeah. I think…I mean, I guess, now that you mentioned, yeah, I think that probably start to be the most. The most frustrating last week was that it was unexpected. 

01:02:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:02:20
CHRIS Umm…Anything that got me with… When I was five was that it just, it came out from nowhere that I just didn't know what to do. 

01:02:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:02:25
CHRIS I didn't know what to do. 

01:02:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So one trigger or button for anger for you might be, when someone's unhappiness comes out of nowhere and then all of a sudden you're just confused and taken aback by what, what's this coming from? And then that seems… I get a sense that seems unfair like you, you know, it's not right for things to come out of nowhere and people to be unhappy with you. 

01:02:55
CHRIS Yeah. Umm… I think for the last week, you know, I thought we had solved it. And I thought like I had, you know, taken the effort to fix and I would just move it over. So, and we just have a good day. We had… You know, we have fun things planned. So it's just… I don't know where it just seems ruined something. I thought like, I finally gonna have a good day and it just comes out nowhere and now it's ruined. I'm pissed. 

01:03:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Something out of the blue that just doesn't seem right, come out of nowhere and wrecks the day, that was gonna be good. And the other thing I heard in the old memory as well as in the present memory or the recent memory was that, a sort of a sense of helplessness like, I don't know what to do. Uh… and, you know, you kind of freeze up, you end up crying with your mom umm…and your mom walks out. But with your boyfriend, it does seem like you feel… uh…I guess the right word might be helpless, like what do I do? I don't know what to do. I can't fix things. He's kind of shut down, right? 

01:03:55
CHRIS Uh-huh… huh… Yeah, I think. Yeah, and that's, that's frustrating because he does shut down and then he really stops talking. And I know that he's feeling bad and I want to do something to help. I don't know what to do. And he isn't talking to me, so I don't know how to figure out what to do. And that's when I, I lose it and then I get frustrated and then I have to leave. 

01:04:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN His shutting down is certainly a button pusher for you and partly related to then what do you do? You feel helpless. There's nothing. So in our work together, sometimes with anger stuff it helps to know what the triggers or the buttons are in advance. And it sounds like you know this one with your boyfriend. And so that's something that maybe you and I can keep talking about in our counseling together, so that we understand it a little bit more. And so you don't have to feel helpless. We can actually think of maybe some constructive things for you to do instead of punching a wall or walking away. Uh…although walking away is not a bad thing. Umm… If you do it, you know, kind of get your boyfriend's permission ahead of time like, I'm gonna walk away when I get too angry. So it might be a constructive way of handling it. But that's really what I'd like to focus on in counseling with you, if that's okay? 

01:05:10
CHRIS Yeah. No, no problem. 

01:05:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Triggers and then how we can help you not feel so helpless. Okay. 

01:05:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, it's just a good example of, of an emotionally focus early recollection? 

01:05:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I really think it was a pretty good one. Uh…He was able to come up with a memory. Uh… the memory was of his mom being mad and not him being mad. Uh…but I gave him permission to go either way. Now if I had more time, I might ask him for another memory and might keep probing until I got one of him being angry as a younger version of himself. 

01:05:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:05:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm…But I thought it was a pretty good example. Uh…his current anger episode had to do with a relational situation. 

01:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:05:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Boyfriend. 

01:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And it had to do with uh… sort of an emotional abandonment. The boyfriend uh… shutdown. He couldn't talk about what was bothering him. We go back to the past. Uh… mom gets angry out of nowhere. And his boyfriend being upset came out of nowhere. And so we had that to link. And then mom continues to be angry, he find, he's starts crying and then mom abandons him physically, walks away. And so a lot of dynamics there. 

01:06:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. How did you feel that Chris responded to that? 

01:06:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I felt like he was, he was pretty much on target in terms of being uh… very expressive young man. You know, he's able to articulate his, the dynamics with his boy-friended him and then he was able to… I, I could see his mom walking into the room and being angry. So I thought he, he, he handled the activity well. Uh…and then I did manage to ask him. Uh…what… I, I remembered to ask him what his uh… what similarities he saw between the two? 

01:07:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:07:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And when I say I remembered to ask him and I'm glad of that, it's because it's so easy as a counselor for me to jump in with my interpretation because I think I've, I've got it. 

01:07:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:07:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But this is where it, it would interfere with the collaboration, right? 

01:07:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:07:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And he picked up on something I hadn't even thought of. He said, well, because eventually in his episode with his boyfriend, he walked away. And then he said, well, and then my mom eventually just walked away when he was crying. I thought that was interesting. And he said, you know, I guess I learned that from her, you know. And, and that may well be true that in his family you couldn't deal with those angry feelings and so you have to at a certain point walk away. 

01:08:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, John, that's, that's a good example about how, how collaboration comes into assessment I think. You mentioned that in other places that you really, really emphasize that. And, and I think many of our viewers might think, you know, assessment isn't being that, the counselor does to the client. But that's a really good example of how, you know, you may bring in that technique within the client again, it's integrated, fully through that. Yeah. 

01:08:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I really think, I'm, I'm glad you're highlighting it because for me it's easy to forget to be collaborative with assessment because we're the expert. I, I, I know how the assessment device works. I know what, you know, the emotion focused early recollection thing is. I've done dozens and hundreds of times, right? So it's easy for me to be the expert. I have to remember to ask him. Ask him what he found to be similar, but also, you know, ongoing way… Does that seem to fit, you know? Here's something I saw and I expressed to him some things that I saw in terms of that dynamics. And uh… and I bounce it off him, you know, he was he was open to hearing my perspective. 

01:09:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:09:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… and that's a good sign in terms of assessing his capability of doing inside oriented counseling. 

01:09:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. You know, I understood you used, you use your trigger button and that came up. How would you use that moving forward in, in working with Chris? 

01:09:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I would say Chris, you know, knowledge is power. And if you know what pisses you off, then you have a chance to have power over it. 

01:09:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:09:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the cool thing about anger and I say this to kids and adults who have anger, repeating anger issues, is it's gonna come back around. You're gonna get another chance to deal with it, because we're human, we all will feel angry at some point in the future. And if we know what makes us angry, then we have a chance to make a new plan. If we don't know what makes us angry, we got awareness, we have no chance to make a new plan. So that's what I'm gonna work on with Chris is, what's the new plan? What's a plan that Chris, you're gonna go to sleep that night thinking to yourself, I did my best. 

01:10:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:10:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I did the best job I could, dealing with my anger and it was better than it used to be. 

01:10:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, I think this is a really good example of, of assessment strategy that will lead to our next one. And our next one is called " Generating a Problem-List and Collaborative Goal-Setting." 

01:10:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:10:25
Assessment Strategies 

01:10:30
Generating a Problem-List and Collaborative Goal-Setting 

01:10:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, well, what is your problem list and collaborative goal-setting? 

01:10:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So problem list is really just a basic CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approach to a first session assessment. Uh… Judith Beck writes about it. And, you know, it's, it's not so narrow that it's only CBT, it's only cognitive behavioral therapy, but it also can be used by people of other different uh… theoretical perspectives. It's just, it's very basic. It's all about the presenting problem. Now a collaborative uh… goal list is something that we want to because of the, of the problem that we talked about before where we focused too much on problems that uh… it just, you know, the old rule. If you focus on something too much, what if you pay attention to grow us (ph)? So we want to try to transform problems into goals. And again Judith Beck writes about this and she also writes about this being an opportunity for therapists to show empathy. So as we identify the problems that brings the counselor, the client for counseling. We have a chance to then have empathy for what those problems are. 

01:11:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So solving in some ways that, you know, if you, you just try and generate a problem list than what you're doing is, you're gonna overemphasizing the problems only by adding the goal setting. What you're doing is kind of creating kind of a bridge again, out of that to where it's not so problem focused, but they are… it's also potential focused in some ways. 

01:12:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, exactly. And if you think about it, the problems sometimes push people toward making some changes. 

01:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:12:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But we want some goals out here that they can actually have a direction for the, for that momentum to go and it can kind of pull them toward the goals. It's also very wellness focused. And I think that's a really good fit for counseling. 

01:12:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. So when we would you use an assessment technique like this? 

01:12:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I think if you were practicing cognitive behavioral therapy, you'd always use it. 

01:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:12:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I think as most sensible counselors, we're going to be open to listening to problems because clients like to talk about problems and they want empathy for their problems. Sometimes they want to have the worst problems and that, that we should be able to attend to that and focus on that. And then… And so I think just about always you're gonna try to include that in an initial interview, an intake interview, uh… some kind of, at least cursory look at, at the problem. 

01:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But it also sounds like that you might continue to do this as certain particular, particular problems arise or client brings in things that they want you know about. 

01:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:13:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And if you think about it from uh… different theoretical perspectives. Once you've got the problem identified… I mean, maybe the problem is uh… you know, fear of social contact. Right? As a behavior, so I'm gonna think about that one way, but if am an sensual, so I'm want to think about another way. Uh… And so you can use it for different theoretical orientations. As long as you don't use too much problem laden psychopathology Laden like which. 

01:13:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. So in a minute we're gonna see you work with Omar. 

01:13:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… 

01:13:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you please set up this, this for us here? 

01:13:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Umm… Well, so I'm gonna try my best to get Omar to share two or three or four problems. Now recognizing that it's a tough thing to do and sometimes at the beginning it's hard for people to clearly articulate their problems. And, and yet sometimes somebody will come in and say, "I think I have obsessive compulsive disorder and they have read about it online and they are pretty clear. But even then we have to sort of break it down and say… 

01:14:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Figure out what's exactly what's going on. 

01:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:14:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN These people misdiagnosed themselves all the time. 

01:14:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

01:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And, and so for him I'm gonna try to give, generate that problem list then you're gonna, you're gonna see me make an effort to transform those problems into goals. Uh…and it's easier and harder depending on the clarity of the problem and uh…some problems just translate to goals more easily than others. And so who knows, I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out. 

01:14:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So we're, we're gonna watch you kind of, you may begin to unpack the problem list. And then we're gonna see you kind of transform that problem list and into goals and how you work together with the client. 

01:14:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I like you're using that phrase under that word unpack. 

01:14:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:14:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So because that's really what we're gonna do. 

01:15:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. 

01:15:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Omar, uh… I'm glad that you have come in for counseling. And one of the things that we should do here at the very beginning, now that we've talked about kind of the red tape confidentiality things is uh…I love to know what brings you here. What kinds of life challenges, concerns, things have been happening? What are the problems that uh… made you decide to come for counseling? 

01:15:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm…Well, I really have been feeling overwhelmed lately. Umm… I feel like I can't… It's just hard for me to get my day started, you know, like on the right foot. Umm… I just don't seem to have the, you know, the, you know, the energy or like a positive outlook, like my day is gonna be good or fruitful or anything like that. 

01:15:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So a sense of being overwhelmed umm… and hard to start your day, that's what I hear you saying. 

01:16:00
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. It really… It's uh… hard for me to get out of bed at times. I just, you know, in the morning or, you know, my alarm clock will wake up or wake me up and I just, I don't, I just… I mean I want to everything's time to get up, but my body is just not really responsive. It's not really moving. 

01:16:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay. What kind of things are happening in your life now that, that feel overwhelming? 

01:16:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh… Well, I've… I'm… I, I recently ended her four year relationship. Uh…about three, three months ago. 

01:16:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:16:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA And umm…there's talk at work of there being I guess, my, you know, some positions being moved around and one of my position… And my position is I think on that list. So that may have something to do with that, I don't know. 

01:17:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. So, at least at the very least you've had the change of the relationship that ended and the possible change at work. And so I think that's, that seems to be the kind of life experience that can bring on a sense of overwhelming feelings. So you get those two things. Anything else going on that kind of contributes to the overwhelmed feeling? 

01:17:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm not really drinking as much. I'm trying to cut that down and I'm kind of used to taking, the few to take off the edge, but I just feel with the way things have being going, if I just go that if, you know, it might turn into something else. 

01:17:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And so you have this sense in your mind like umm… you are, maybe vulnerable or it's possible that you could drink too much. And you're also kind of have a goal for yourself that you would drink less, is that, is it right? 

01:18:00
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:18:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you're trying to drink less and you realize it this overwhelming state would make it. 

01:18:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA I think so. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't wanted to get any worse than what it is and I think I know myself okay enough to not do that because this is really kind of freaking me out. 

01:18:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. So I just… If it's okay can I give you a little compliment? 

01:18:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Sure. 

01:18:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I mean, I… It sounds to me like there's quite a bit of awareness around. You've had this pattern of maybe drinking a little too much and now you realized during a stressful time, overwhelmed time that that you really shouldn't drink so much and that seems like, seem like good judgment. 

01:18:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Oh, thank you. Yeah, I mean, I know, it's happened in my family, so I don't want to end up like some people. So… 

01:18:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You've seen that in your family history? 

01:18:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:18:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Is it okay if I write down a couple a notes? 

01:18:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Sure. 

01:18:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… One of the reasons I asked that is, I, I want to try to take those concerns that you have now and then we want to try to move them into goals that we can work on together in counseling. And so umm… So you said feeling overwhelmed. Okay? 

01:19:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:19:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you said hard to get up in the morning. 

01:19:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:19:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then it sounds like there's some uncertainty about work umm… 

01:19:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Like my position can be, you know, removed essentially because they are, they are doing this whole management shift thing and… Yeah, there's talk of just my job possibly, you know, yeah, being eradicated. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen it happen before. 

01:19:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:19:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:19:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so, I mean, I, when I think about, think about, that's, that's probably pretty high stress and probably contributes to your stress level. 

01:19:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah, it's very stressful because I need to be able to make, make, you know, my, make my payments, make my bills. 

01:20:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… Umm…So those are some thoughts that go through your mind associated with some possibility of having your job disappear. 

01:20:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… And, and since we divorced umm…you know, I'm kind of left with half, so… 

01:20:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And so that the break up was an actual divorce and so you have half of the resources. 

01:20:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Right. 

01:20:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so I'm just writing down these things, sort of using uh… words that reflect problems. But now I want to, I want to just, just take a look at them briefly. I've got four things listed and uh…we're gonna focus on those now. Uh… I know other things may come up. And if they do, just throw them out here and I'll write him down. 

01:20:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

01:20:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But umm… So the sense of being overwhelmed seems like umm… overwhelmed with stress. And so if we made that overwhelming feeling go away, what would be there instead? 

01:21:00
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… I would probably say… I know whatever normal is. 

01:21:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. What feels normal to you? 

01:21:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Probably content with. 

01:21:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So you'd wake up in the morning… 

01:21:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Or not as stressed yet. 

01:21:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. You feel content and less stress. 

01:21:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Less stress, yes. Yeah. 

01:21:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Would uh… the word calm or feeling more calm, would that fits you? 

01:21:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, more… Yeah, more calm, not as edgy. Umm… Yeah. Yeah, I would say that. Yeah, definitely I could use more calmness. 

01:21:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay. 

01:21:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:21:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So that might be one word we would put in a goal is a free to feel contented and calm. Those maybe, maybe a couple words for goals. Is that fit? 

01:21:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA That fits. 

01:21:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And then you have trouble getting up in the morning umm… and so I'm wondering if one goal would just be to get up in the morning? 

01:22:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:22:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's simple. What's your… What do you think when I say that? 

01:22:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Yeah, I just, I think I have to force myself into getting up, just, just getting up. It has to… It has to happen. 

01:22:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It has to happen. 

01:22:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA It has to happen. 

01:22:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:22:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:22:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So we'll put that on the list of goals recognizing that sometimes when you try to do something, it's really basic like getting up. There are a number of things that happen in your head that sabotage that. So we might have to work on those too. 

01:22:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

01:22:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? 

01:22:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

01:22:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… And then the work stress. 

01:22:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… 

01:22:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It seems like it's out of control, out of your control to transform your workplace into a place where you have a secure position, right? 

01:22:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:22:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What would that look like as a goal being comfortable with some of the uncertainty? 

01:23:00
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, I guess just maybe try not to worry about it so much. Umm… just go in and just, you know, do the best that I can and maybe just hope for the best. I think, maybe I'm just looking for some sort of hope. 

01:23:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So the goal might be to develop some positive hope for the future. Uh… and the negative side of that is just to try not to worry, to try to reduce the worry, for the worry time. And maybe what we'll try to do is to replace that worry time with something that's more positive. So that makes sense? 

01:23:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA That makes sense. 

01:23:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay.. And then the break up. 

01:23:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:23:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What do you… What do you see as some way that we can talk about that as a goal or adjusting to being by yourself? What? 

01:23:45
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Adjusting umm… would be… Adjusting would be good. Umm…just being on my own, you know, because I've been in a relationship for so long. I think just getting back into the swing of just, just being alone. 

01:24:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So being comfortable being on your own, being adjusted, feeling like you're adjusted to that situation of being on your own. 

01:24:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, sure. 

01:24:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Now we've put some positive words on that and so those are all goals and we're going to go back and forth. Umm… and we're gonna talk about these things some more as we work. Umm…because I haven't asked you much about, for example, that relationship that broke up. And so I hope we can talk more about that. But for now we've got four ideas about goals that we can work on together. 

01:24:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Okay. 

01:24:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, is this a good example of generating a problem list and, and doing clerical setting? 

01:24:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I think it was a reasonable example umm… I have to say that, you know, as I experienced the process, it was pretty challenging. And the thing that I felt umm… was I felt a little rushed. And it may or may not have come through, I don't know, if you noticed that. But umm… it was like, we got four problems. The first one was being overwhelmed. You know, second one was having trouble getting up in the morning. And, and I knew I had some time pressure and so transforming those into goals was just hard. Overwhelming was relatively easy, because I equated it to some extent with stress and so then being… I asked him what the goal would be. He said content or contentment. And I used the word calm. Uh… you know, and, and going to… Having trouble getting up in the morning we, we transformed to getting up in the morning. Right. 

01:25:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

01:25:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Which was pretty simple. Uh…but then he had a relationship break up, a long term relationship break up. And then he was worried about getting fired from work. Now some of those things are just a little less clear in terms of how do I transform that into a goal? In the moment I struggled a little bit, but I felt like we managed to get some words around it. And so yeah it was a pretty good example. Maybe a little compressed. 

01:26:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. But it's always it sounds like that's typical work with clients and that clients come in with real life scenarios. And as they impact these things, they impact things in all different areas. 

01:26:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wouldn't be nice if fit where we're going to a nice box that we could deal with. 

01:26:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. I know that during that clip you took notes, umm…but you also asked, asked Omar's permission to take notes. Is that typical? 

01:26:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I like to do that. Umm…. So one of my thoughts is that uh… asking permission is an invitation for collaboration. So I want him to be fully engaged and involved in our interactions. And so when I say, is it okay if I write down? Especially if I haven't started with taking notes… But I would do it at the beginning anyway. 

01:26:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:26:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But if you haven't started taking those and then suddenly you pick up your notepad… 

01:26:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So writing things down and…. 

01:26:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, yes. It makes people a little paranoid. 

01:27:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:27:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… So I want him to know that this is just routine. I want to get his permission. He says, yes. And then if he wants to know what I wrote, I'll hand him my notepad. You know… 

01:27:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Good. I think it's often a question students have is that of a client wants to see your notes, do you show him your notes and you're saying… Right. 

01:27:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Again, my, my emphasis is on the, is on the working alliance, on collaborative relationships. If I said, no, I'm keeping my notes to myself. I am putting a stake in the heart in the… The stake in the heart of, of a collaborative trusting relationship. 

01:27:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So it sounds like again like there's a small kind of twists you, you put in the work that you do, that kind of builds up this larger piece that kind of including the client. The client feels like this is their counseling, their therapy, and, and they are working together on it, so… Good. How would you use this moving forward? So you generate a problem list, you, you beginning to set these kind of goals moving forward. How would you use this? 

01:28:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I use that… The goals really formulate in the problems. Both of those are, are a big part of the treatment plan. Okay. 

01:28:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. We want to get from here to here to here. 

01:28:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:28:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And it's nice to have, be clear about the problem and about what's contributing to the problem. And so we later we'll get into more detail about that. Then we want to know, have a clear image of the goals and of course the solution. Focused people would say, the more we can keep those goals in our mind, the more, the better chance we have of reaching there. It's not a magical or miracle process. But it is true that if we can keep people focused on the goal, it helps to motivate them to go that direction. So now we've got to build a plan, right? Now the case formulation is gonna be based on my theoretical orientation. If I'm a CBT guy, you can bet I'm gonna be prescribing behaviors and different substitute cognitions and other kinds of activities to help him reframe himself and the problem and move closer to the solutions. 

01:29:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:29:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… but if I have a different theoretical orientation, it's gonna make it a different case formulation about what's causing this or what's driving this and then that will shape the treatment plan a little bit different, to make a little different. 

01:29:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON We're looking at, at this clip with Omar's or anything that you might do differently. Well, again I think my pace. 

01:29:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:29:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It was a little uh… tight. Well, you know, we have time boundaries. 

01:29:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:29:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… And so I would linger a little longer on the problems because I want him to really see that I have compassion. He has broke up from a four year relationship. I need to spend time on that, unless he doesn't want to. If he says, always in the past, I don't want to talk about it. I'll avoid it with him at least for now. But for the most part, most people want to tell you about the pain, a little bit about the pain that they have experienced. And so I would have lingered there longer. And then I would have lingered with the goals longer and, and have him imagine it and maybe even take a moment to do a visualization. So I want you to just imagine yourself getting up in the morning and you see what does it take? What do you move first, you know? 

01:30:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:30:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What do you think? And so I would have lingered with both those a little longer. 

01:30:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So many ways this, this aspect of assessment could almost be a whole session as you begin to kind of really understand what people bring in? Yeah. Yeah. 

01:30:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Well, if you think about it, umm…. if we can accomplish by the end of a session. If we can have the problem, case formulation treatment plan… 

01:30:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's a pretty good session pretty good session. 

01:30:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's a pretty good session pretty good session. 

01:30:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Good. Okay. Let's move on, on to our, to our next uh… clip which is on using scaling questions. 

01:30:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:30:45
Assessment Strategies 

01:30:45
Using Scaling 

01:30:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is scaling and how is that used in the process of assessment? 

01:30:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN There are lot of ways, a lot of the ways to think about scaling. And maybe the first one was uh… used primarily with systematic desensitization by behaviors and they called them SUDS, Subjective Units of Distress. I'm trying to think what the scale? So the SUD scale. 

01:31:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:31:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, you know, and that was on a 0-100 scale. And that 100 would be complete distress, zero would be no distress. Here's mellow as a jellyfish or… 

01:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:31:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… You know, and solution focused counselors have uh… transformed scaling to some extent into a very positive therapeutic process. Where if you're, if you're, if we're doing a zero to ten rating of mood, zero is the worst, ten is the best. And you're at three and I say, "What would it look like for you to get to a four? And then we can get a concrete idea of what a four looks like to you, not to me. And then we can start to build that image and how you get to the four. And it's, it's based on the solution focused or constructive theoretical idea that small changes create big changes. 

01:32:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Is that how you use that typically or…? 

01:32:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So I am trying… I'm using umm… a mood rating. 

01:32:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:32:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Zero to ten. And I'm using… It's a combination of a solution focused model with a mental status examination mood assessment. And so I ask… I, I will ask the, the client. Is it okay if I do a little assessment of your mood? The person says, yes, they always say, yes. Then I, then I give out the scale. And uh… so the scale is, zero is the bottom. It's the worst possible your mood could be. You're so down and depressed, you're just gonna kill yourself. So I want that to be the basement solid bottom, anchoring the bottom. And then the top is, as happy as you could possibly be. Maybe you're so happy, you're dancing or singing or whatever it is that you do when you're really, really happy. So I start there umm… and I say, and I've anchored the scale. Sometimes I repeat it second time because if individuals are depressed, sometimes they are not tracking really well. And I'll say, so where you are right Now? And then the client gives me, you know, whatever the client gives, you know, a three, I'm a three. And I'll say, well, what's going on right now today that has made you three? 

01:33:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then I usually go from there to the worst in the last two months. 

01:33:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I want to get a sense of the stability of mood, but also how low it's gotten. 

01:33:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so the worst mood in the last two months, person give me a rating, maybe it's, maybe it's three, maybe it's two, many it's six. Uh… What was going on then to make it a two or three or six? And then uh… I usually will ask right at that point. Well, and what's, what's about average for you? Because I want to know what's a person's average mood. A lot of people will say five, but a lot of people surprise me and they will say eight. You know, eight is my average. I'm like ah… 

01:34:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow. Yeah. 

01:34:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're a good mood person. Umm… And then I finish it by going back to a high rating in the last two, two months. What's the best rating, the highest mood rating you give. I want to end on a positive. Uh… And my goal in this assessment, uh… which we will see I think shortly is, I want to know what brings the client down and I want to know what brings the client up and it's going to getting a treatment for depressed mood. 

01:34:35
Okay. 

01:34:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm…and possibly suicidality, if you get that. I like to embed suicidality at the floor because it naturally give us a way to talk about it. 

01:34:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. Sure. It sounds like this is the assessment that you would kind of use ongoing throughout, throughout the process of counseling. Like to get, you know, information about current functioning, past functioning, what how the client is viewing, their experiences? 

01:35:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, you know, it is subjective, right? 

01:35:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:35:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh…but it's also a self report. And, you know, I'm hearing from her and we have a mutual language for talking about her level of mood. 

01:35:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that's a useful thing for us to have. 

01:35:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna watch you work with Kayle. Can you tell us a bit more about what we might see? 

01:35:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And I hope you're gonna see me do exactly what I just described, umm…which is, explain the scale to her. First ask permission. That's the invitation for collaboration. And then describe the scale and then hopefully have a productive discussion about uh…, you know, where she is now, worst. How do you improve moods, things like that. 

01:35:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds good. 

01:35:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Kayle, do you mind if we do a little mood assessment. Uh…is it okay for you, if I ask a few questions about that? Umm… So I'm gonna use a scale. And so on a scale of zero to ten. Zero is the bottom. It's the worst you could possibly feel. It's a very, very depressed and you're just gonna kill yourself because it's the worst. You can't get any worse than that. And ten is the top. Ten is the best it could be. And maybe you're singing or dancing or whatever you do when you're really, really as happy as you could be. So that's our scale. And so thinking about that scale, zero being the bottom, ten being the top. Uh… How will you rate yourself right now? 

01:36:25
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… I think right now I'm at about four. 

01:36:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So your mood is about four right now. 

01:36:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:36:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What is it that's going on in your life or in our session that makes it a four? 

01:36:40
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… Well, last time my boyfriend and I got in a fight and so umm… Yeah, because of that I feel like (inaudible ) up in the air. And umm… I just, I wasn't, haven't been able to sleep all night and then coming here, it's just like, it's just been on my mind and just all the negative things that could happen, so I'm feeling pretty down there. 

01:37:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So a fight with, with your boyfriend brings you down. Maybe… So I get a sense that average for you is higher than four. 

01:37:10
KAYLEIGH SOTO I'd say, usually I'm about like at least a seven. 

01:37:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:37:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:37:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You go along in life around seven, but because of the fight last night, not being able to sleep, things like that, you're about four right now. Okay. If you were to look back in the last two months, umm… what would be the lowest that you would give yourself on that same scale, zero being the very bottom and ten being the top? 

01:37:35
KAYLEIGH SOTO I want to say a zero. 

01:37:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You were down to a zero in the last couple of months. What was going on then? 

01:37:40
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… I mean, like another fight either fight that I had with my boyfriend, but umm…he was kind of threatening to break up with me and umm…I don't take that very well. Umm…And I just… Like I was alone and I was feeling really suicidal and umm… I… You know, I found like a box cutter and I just umm… like I did some self relief because I just didn't know like what else to do. I didn't… Uh… I just felt alone and I have anyone to call or anything and uh… I just felt like at the low, so the low like, what's the point after this, if this ends and like… 

01:38:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:38:20
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… Yeah, just really, really a bad time. 

01:38:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So you're really at the bottom. And that was uh…some time in the last couple months? 

01:38:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO It's like two months ago. 

01:38:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:38:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:38:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And uh… with same boyfriend? 

01:38:35
KAYLEIGH SOTO Uh-huh… 

01:38:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So big fight and he threatened to break up umm… and so you did a little bit of umm… You found some box cutters, you did some cutting, it sounds like… Umm… And that changed your mood a little Bit? 

01:38:55
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah, I brought it up to like a one because, you know, the, the pain although it was kind of a relieving because it took away from like the heart, the heart ache. Umm… It was too scary for me to kind of follow through further So that's why, I was like okay, I don't want to die, but I just mean, like something. Like to feel something. 

01:39:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So even in that moment, you're pretty clear in your mind, I don't want to die. 

01:39:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:39:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… but you were very low. And it sounds like part of it was a sense that umm… he was breaking up with you, abandoning you, but also you felt really alone then. There was… And you said, there was no one you could call. 

01:39:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. Like, he's all I have. And so just and I've been abandoned before. 

01:39:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know how painful that is. 

01:39:40
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:39:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so that is a very vulnerable hard spot. Yeah. So if we were to look at the last two months and say, well, what's the highest rate that you've ever had in the last two months? What will the highest rating be? 

01:40:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… I mean, like I finished the semester in my school a couple days ago and so I felt really happy about that, just to kind of have all my stress done. So I'd say, I was about, like uh… eight or nine up there, like just being happy and feeling accomplished. 

01:40:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay. So umm… so that accomplishment brought you up above average for you, which is about a seven. And you're up an eight or nine, it seems like that would be pretty happy. 

01:40:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:40:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And so… And I don't want to… You know, I don't want to overlook the fact that as you were talking about the zero, I could see that, even thinking about being abandoned and being alone brought up a lot of feelings. And so I don't want you to think that I missed that. But also it's important for us as we talk about your moods. What brings you up as well as the kinds of things that have you go down? So, so eight or nine, not long ago, seven on average, but… I, I, I get that impression that, when there's some relationship uh…break up possibility, you go down that scale pretty fast. 

01:41:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:41:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Do you go back up the scale just as fast? 

01:41:20
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… I would say, so. Like if the fight resolved or, you know, he apologizes, just the thing I, I find myself and being like… Oh, was I still worried about? Like everything's fine. I feel like I do go up just as fast, umm… but I feel like, I don't stay there as far as long. When it's lower, I stay there longer. 

01:41:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Okay. So you can go up pretty fast, but the lower you are, the harder it is to get back up very quickly. Umm… And other things that bring you up and I know that maybe one thing that would bring you up is, you and your boyfriend sort of mend do things and you feel better. Uh… And then I heard you say that the little tiny bit of cutting that you did uh…helped bring you from a zero to one. Uh… But what are some other things umm… besides those two that might bring you up a little bit? 

01:42:10
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm…I may again think of some bad ones like drinking. Uh… It's less, better than cutting, but it's not great. Uh… If I'm going more positive, maybe like, sometimes I like to go for a run. And I just feel, if I just like to run out the stress and like the sadness, sometimes I feel better after. 

01:42:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:42:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:42:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So running uh… positive and constructive one. 

01:42:35
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:42:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Drinking can bring you up a little bit. It sounds like sometimes, but maybe you recognize that it's not a good coping tool. 

01:42:45
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:42:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:42:45
KAYLEIGH SOTO Sometimes that downward spirals and, that backlashes. 

01:42:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It could go either way. 

01:42:50
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

01:42:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay, good to know that. Yeah. How about, if you're down umm… can you ever remember like during that moment that you're down that… Hey, you're just, you're just graduated. I mean, you just had a big accomplishment in your life. What happens if you try to insert a positive thought like that? 

01:43:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO I'd tried, I could try to, but then I just feel like… Then I think, well, what's the point of being accomplished if there's nobody there to like share it with me, like it's all that, it's like all the negative talk kind of overrides any positives I have. Umm… Like what's the point of being accomplished when I'm overwhelmed? 

01:43:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So if you try to think about being accomplish in that moment, you find a way to spoil it. It's like, oh, but I'll be alone. Yeah. And really it sounds like you're sort of a permanent thought, like, but I'll be alone. You won't find anybody new, at that, it doesn't… Like you don't think umm… I'm accomplished and successful. And I might meet somebody new, that doesn't go through? 

01:44:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO I've never thought about that. That's an interesting umm…. Yeah, I mean thinking about that, now that makes more sense than my, my negative self doubting thoughts. Yeah. 

01:44:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I'm not saying that you should think that. All I'm doing is, we're trying to kind of experiment with you to see what different kinds of thoughts, how they might affect you in different kinds of behaviors. And we know running is a behavior that brings you up. Umm… And it's just hard for you to hang on to that accomplished thought when you're really low. Umm… But there might be some things as we work together in the future, that we can figure out to help you have a plan for… If you come down low, if there's a breakup possibility, umm…what are some things that you could do that are more positive coping responses. And so if it's okay with you. That's… Those are some of the kinds of things I'd like to work with you on in our counseling together. 

01:45:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah, I like that. 

01:45:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. I really appreciate you being open. I know it's hard for some people sometimes to talk about suicidal thoughts uh… or impulses. And I, I think it takes a lot of courage to do that. So thank you for doing that. 

01:45:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Thank you. 

01:45:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, is this a typical example of using scaling? 

01:45:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think it went out really well. You know, Kayle was, uh…was very articulate and responsive. And so was it a typical example? It might be better than typical. You know, she was, she was very clear about some things that I think were important for us to focus on in counseling. 

01:45:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So she kind of… With this as a technique, you mean, she really could respond to it and rose the occasion and, and could really kind of match with what, what you're looking for? 

01:45:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You know, and so, I really was impressed with the fact that uh…in the last two months she could give me a zero. Okay. Well, she's then telling me that there was suicide and she was able to share with me that she felt suicidal after, almost break up with her boyfriend. She thought maybe they were breaking up. And the idea that her boyfriend would break up with her was uh… terrible thing for her to feel. And then she's able to tell me about cutting that she did to get from it, took her from a zero to a one during that suicidal crisis. Uh… difficult stuff to talk about it for her, difficult stuff for me to listen to, but it's way better if we talk about it. You know, I don't want her to leave my office, if she's had those kinds of thoughts and feelings and she might be in a suicidal crisis next week. And I got, I have no idea what, where it's coming from or why, what might have triggered it? 

01:46:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You mentioned earlier that, when you do the assessment, you kind of look at where the client is, kind of their best and their worst and I kind of gives the range and, and when she gave you her worst, you know, she gave us these feelings of suicide, the source of suicide and pretty, pretty strong detail. So how would you continue to assess that with her and work with her on that? 

01:47:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, one thing just really quickly. Some people will go uh…further than she did. She didn't really talk about a suicide attempt. In fact, she said uh…,you know, after she cut a little bit, she also realized that she… I, I want to live. I tried to use my highlighter technique there, where I said, so in this moment, you also noticed the feeling of… that you want to live. Okay. So that's really focusing on suicide intent and that's a part of counseling going forward. Right? I now have a little bit of leverage here. This… I, I know even in the suicidal crisis moment, she didn't really want to die. She wanted to feel better. And she managed to have to feel better, a little bit with cutting. Now we don't want that to be a long term coping solution. She also mentioned drinking helps her feel a little better. Uh… We don't want that to be a long term coping situation. And finally, she mentioned exercise helps her feel a little bit better. And we do want that to be an ongoing coping strategy. And so in all those cases, I'm, I'm figuring out, I'm learning from her what uh… destructive coping, what's constructive coping and uh… what brings her down to the pit of despair. And that gives us a chance to make a plan uh…for how she can deal with a suicide crisis in the future. But maybe even more importantly, how we can avoid a suicide crisis in a future which is way better, because it's hard when somebody is in a suicide crisis, for them to think of anything positive. 

01:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Yeah, I'm struck by, you know, when she talked about, about cutting and the drinking. I know it's that, there was no judgment, just understanding what you're saying and why she was saying that, recognizing that, that helped her get from zero to one, but really allowing her to kind of speak the truth and this is the way things are and… Yeah. 

01:49:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, one of my big perspectives on suicide and on working with clients who have suicide ideation or impulses, is that, we have to be super accepting, because they are so used to judging, being judged. And uh… she doesn't need my judgment. Uh…she needs my compassion. Uh….she's in emotional pain. Uh…and if I judge… If I freak out, that's another thing, that… If I am not ready for it and I would really advocate for students to practice this, so that they are ready for somebody to talk about suicide. Because if I'm not ready for it uh…and I freak out a little bit, you cut yourself? You know, I don't have to. You know, lots of people cut. And, you know, they, you know, some college sororities they talk about 50% being cutters, right? Well, I don't have to make any emergency crisis move there. I need to have compassion. I need to understand the dynamic and help her move forward in a more constructive way. It's, it's no, no… It's too soon to panic. 

01:50:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It just struck me as you did that. I mean, you know, you're going to doing this question of scaling. You don't know what you're gonna get. You know, so you, you get something like that which certainly draws your attention. So you're gonna talk about it. 

01:50:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. But then even and as you engaged with her, there really was a with her again. This is a, a collaborative conversation about something that we're going to talk about because it's important umm…an idea being and you're gonna help her work through, uh…through it. 

01:50:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And I think I asked her a couple of times, you know, are you okay with us as we go forward in counseling? 

01:50:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:50:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Are you okay with us focusing in? Because for me the most profound part, you know, and, uh…and… You know, in cognitive therapy you might call it a core maladaptive belief, right? She says that her father abandoned her at age three months and that… So now she has this core belief. She's unwanted. Right? And that, that's what's getting trigger. She's carried that along with her for years, a couple of decades. And she's got that, those thoughts in the back of her mind. And so I asked her permission basically, can we go after that? Because… What a terrible way to have to live? 

01:51:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, again like again that invitation to, to work together on it, to offered the, the empathy. You know, and even as you're saying, I can see kind of feeling that, kind of what that's like to kind of have that core belief. Yeah. 

01:51:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I would, it would be a terrible, terrible painful core belief. 

01:51:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:51:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So the last thing I guess worth commenting on about the session, was I then tried to give her a quick homework assignment. And, I know, it was a hastily thought of homework assignment. You know, and sometimes we have to do that because on the spot, the client doesn't really fit our pre-planned homework assignment. Umm… And I have her just noticing when she feels desirable, any kind of desirable quality. And I also, and this is I think important. As I give her permission to not necessarily succeed. I wish I hadn't used the word fail, but I did use word, if you happen to fail at this, that's okay. We'll learn something from that. Uh…I would have rather have phrased it as… If, if you don't happen to succeed and come up with a list of desirable qualities, that's okay too. Uh…because it's just part of our work together. 

01:52:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Let's move on to, to our next assessment strategy called, " The Typical Day." 

01:52:45
Assessment Strategies 

01:52:50
Assessment of Current Functioning: 

01:52:50
The Typical Day 

01:52:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, what you mean by, by assessing the typical day? 

01:53:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, if you think back to the clinical interview, uh… one of the three parts of the clinical interview is to assess current functioning or current situation in life. And we start with a problem, we go to the past of the person and I want to come back to the present in a full in take interview. And so this is a way for us to do it. Umm… and it's really nice continuity for the flow of an interview to come back to the present. 

01:53:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:53:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Typical day is exactly what it sounds like. Umm… Well, I hope you don't have typical day. But, you know, a typical work day. 

01:53:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:53:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Typical weekend day. Sometimes you might want to make a distinction. Umm…but it gives you a glimpse into the person's life. Sometimes you just can't get any other way. 

01:53:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it's not like this would as part of the clinical interview. And my hunch is that you might revisit it again down the road, in the course of a treatment? 

01:53:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I certainly could. I certainly could. You know, Irvin Yalom, the great existential and group therapist. He says, he uses it in every first session. He thinks he does. Umm… And, and he does because, again, you know, you, you'll run into things, that you just don't run into like you might run into a person lying in bed too long. You might run into somebody using a substance. You might run into somebody who is just bombarded with stress every minute of the day. And so it's really important for us to get that. Well, what happened next? And then you had lunch. And what happened next? 

01:54:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So in some ways are a typical days evolve over time with us, right? So new things may come into our typical day, other things may leave and you just gets a sense of kind of what's really happening to the person in the present. 

01:54:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And some people live more in routine than others. 

01:54:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:54:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, some people get up and, you know, do some exercise first thing in the morning. Uh… And that could be a really good healthy habit to have and a typical day. So people would never have that fire crossed… 

01:55:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how exactly do you, do you do this? 

01:55:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm just gonna ask… 

01:55:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:55:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Please just walk me through. Is it okay? Will you mind walking me through your typical day? 

01:55:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna watch you work with Omar. Umm… Can you, can you set us up for us? 

01:55:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You know, uh…I'm gonna just uh… be really clear and direct. It's interesting uh…George Kelly, that one of the guys historically associated with constructive therapy said that, one of the best forms of assessment is credulous assessment. It's just asking clients, what's going on? 

01:55:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds good though. Yeah, it's great way… 

01:55:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It is. It is a very credulous. 

01:55:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:55:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I'm just going to be asking Omar, what's happening in a typical day in your life? 

01:55:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:55:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So in our time together today so far, Omar, we talked some about the problems that brought you to counseling. We transformed them into some goals. We talked about you as a person and your past, your growing up years. And now we've got maybe 10, 15 minutes left. And so I'd like to come back to the present and find out if you could tell me, walk me through typical day for you in your life. Uh… It just gives me a different glimpse, a different way of seeing into what's happening for you right now in your life. 

01:56:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA Oh, okay. So umm…I wake up. Umm…I have a little hard time getting out of bed. Umm… And I think about uh… you know, the day ahead and what I'm, what I'm faced with and… 

01:56:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So why you're lying in bed in the morning? 

01:56:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… 

01:56:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN About what time are you getting up and..? 

01:56:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA About 7:30. 

01:56:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So about 7:30 on a typical day, you're laying in bed, you're awake and you may be thinking of some of the things that you're facing. 

01:56:50
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh-huh… Yeah. I'm, not the day I had. I'm thinking about the commute. I'm thinking about what I'm gonna have to eat. Umm… You know, I'm just thinking about some of the stuff that's, that's happened uh…in, in the past. And uh…, you know, just how am I gonna, how am I gonna make it through this day? 

01:57:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure. 

01:57:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:57:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And not unusual, I think, for people when you're lying in bed, sometimes before you go to sleep at night, sometimes first thing in the morning for there to be a little bit of a flood of… It sounds like not all negative thoughts, but quite a few? 

01:57:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just… It's a very stressful and hard for me to get up. So… But once I do manage to get up… 

01:57:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What happens? What gets you up? 

01:57:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… I just… I have to force myself. It's just, I have to pay the bills, I have to go to work. So… 

01:57:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you have that kind of thought bouncing around your head. I got to get up. I've got to pay the bills like… Is that what finally…? 

01:57:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yes. Yes. It's… It's that… I won't be able to live here if I don't go to work and make, make the, the money. 

01:58:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:58:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

01:58:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay. So… So then you finally kind of coach yourself. Like inner-coach says, you got to get up, man, and you do. And then what happens? 

01:58:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA So I, I get up and then I just go and start trying to make breakfast. And as I'm making breakfast, uh… I think of the drive ahead of me and, you know, (inaudible ). You know, if I'm running late, it's even worse. So sometimes I don't eat uh…but… Yeah. After breakfast I'm just trying to get ready as fast as I can, because it's always last minute. I'm in bed. It is, until the very last minute. Where it's like, if I don't get up right now then I'm gonna be late to work. 

01:58:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So you lay there a little too long and then you get up and rush around. And sometimes you even miss breakfast? 

01:58:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yes. 

01:58:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And you've got a bit of a commute. In your car or you taking public transportation? 

01:59:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, I'm taking my car. 

01:59:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:59:05
OMAR DE LA VEGA I'm taking my car. 

01:59:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you hop in my car and do the commute. 

01:59:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. I go and humping my car, I'm doing the commute and as, I'm, I'm going to work. I just, I just start, you know, I just get stressed out and I just dread going into work. 

01:59:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And as you're in the car, it sounds like you're still having some thoughts and that most of those thoughts are kind of negative, would that be accurate? 

01:59:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:59:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Any physical sensations as you're in the car? Sometimes those things go together. 

01:59:40
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, I feel like my heart's racing. I feel like umm…,you know, a little bit more sweaty hair than usual. Umm… You know, my… I'm very on edge. You know, I would say. You know, as I'm driving my hand kind of just… I don't know. I have to like do something to like try and calm myself down. 

02:00:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So it's pretty darn unpleasant. This is not a fun commute. You're thinking negative thoughts. You're feeling physically uncomfortable. Heart racing. Are you… Are you Safe? It feels, like you're safe on the road? 

02:00:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Uh…as safe as I can be. Umm… I just try and stick to my lane and just try to get there as, as quick as possible. 

02:00:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So you get to work, you stick in your lane and then, and then what happens? 

02:00:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA So I, I get to work and then I'd start working on… What I have to do? Look at my emails all. We have a meeting every time I get there. So there's always some apprehension with the meeting. And right after uh… You know, I'm just there for about seven or eight hours after work. Umm… I just can't wait to, to get back home and, yeah, and just lay down. 

02:01:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. So it sounds like we've kind of just slid right through your workday. And I think there's some distress going on then, certainly some negative thoughts. Apprehension was the word you used. We're gonna come back and talk more about that. But, so but after the workday ends, you're pretty relieved. It sounds like. 

02:01:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. 

02:01:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You head home. You want to go home lay down. So what exactly happens then? 

02:01:25
OMAR DE LA VEGA So as I'm going back to work, I just think about how good my bed is gonna feel, how good just being by myself and uh…not really having to deal with, you know, crazy drivers or my coworkers or, you know, just all these deadlines that I have to do. I can just… I guess, I could say, like, I could exhale. You know, take that breath of relaxation. 

02:01:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. What a relief. You get home. You lay down then or you do other things, typical? 

02:01:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Umm… Won't typically, I mean, I'll have a bit to eat, you know, as I'm watching some TV. But essentially I'm laying down and the T.V. is on mute, like… 

02:02:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And then through the evening uh… 

02:02:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, through the evening. It's just more of the same. 

02:02:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's laying around. 

02:02:15
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah. I just… Well, I mean I just a little. Just a little bit. I can't… I don't really seem to have that much of a appetite. 

02:02:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

02:02:20
OMAR DE LA VEGA But uh…. yeah, I'll just lay down and watch some T.V. and then just go to bed. 

02:02:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So that's kind of a routine typical day. 

02:02:30
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, a lot of worry. 

02:02:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Yeah, lot of worry. I want to ask one more question and then umm… we're gonna have to end. But umm…during that day there's a lot of apprehension and some negative thoughts and some physical discomfort and distress. There are any moments during the day when you're feeling umm…a little lift, a little bit better? 

02:02:55
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yeah, I would say when I… I think it's brief and it's when I get to work. 

02:03:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

02:03:00
OMAR DE LA VEGA It's knowing that I actually got there on time. 

02:03:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. There's a sense of accomplishment or relief or something like that? 

02:03:10
OMAR DE LA VEGA Yes, there's that. Yeah. And then when I'm going home uh… knowing that I just turned in my work, umm… it makes me feel good. 

02:03:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Good. Well, we're gonna wind up now. And I got a few things we're gonna do in terms of scheduling for our next appointment. But I really appreciate your openness and you sharing so much about yourself during our, our meeting today. 

02:03:35
OMAR DE LA VEGA Thank you. 

02:03:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, is this a typical example of asking someone about their typical day? 

02:03:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, it was. It was, I think, relatively representative. Everybody is different. Umm… And, yeah, Omar was… He was interesting. I felt like I wasn't gonna make it through his work day uh… because… 

02:04:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Because? 

02:04:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It just seemed like… I don't know. And it's my own, maybe my own (inaudible ) transference. But it's just didn't seemed like work was a good, very fun place to be. 

02:04:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I didn't know if I was going to get him out of bed in the morning either, because, you know, he started with that uh… basically morning rumination. 

02:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

02:04:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Tough. 

02:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

02:04:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, laying there just thinking negative thoughts. Uh… Finally managing to coach himself out of, out of bed. Uh… Interesting. 

02:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it strikes me as you said that there's that empathy then about how you connect with a client, what (inaudible ), and how… In some ways you, how do you walk through their day in their shoes? 

02:04:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:04:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

02:04:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, I thought to myself, uh… I asked him, I think, whether he drove himself to work or he took public transportation. I think he had a better 45 minute commute. Uh… Well, you know, could be my counter-transference, but that would not be something I would look forward to. I would think… I wonder if there's a way to take a bus. I could read. You know, something but uh… 

02:05:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well, maybe I read it sounds like you're beginning to think about potential interventions, potential way to intervene, maybe use some of the expertise you could offer. 

02:05:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, if you think about uh… He's spending a significant period of time in the morning ruminating with negative thoughts. And then that 45 minute commute is mostly thinking about the stress of work. 

02:05:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:05:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN He's got himself worn down. He said enough negative thoughts for a week. 

02:05:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And that's a hard way to open a new day. 

02:05:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… Yeah. So that gave me a feel for him and how much, how, how depressed he is, but how much that depression is characterized by negative cognitions uh…and anticipatory, anticipation of stress and distress? 

02:05:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I noticed that, in, in that clip. Uh… There's so much that is down for him. And it was that, you asked him for an exception to that? Can you explain kind of the reasoning behind that? 

02:06:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You know, umm… Everybody has times that are down. And when you're in the midst of it, it's sometimes hard to think of any other times. And so sometimes clients really need us to ask about an exception, because they wouldn't have thought of even volunteering an exception. Uh… And it's, so it's really crucial for us to take the lead a little bit there. So a little solution focused, you know, and exception question is a solution focused question. But it's really our responsibility if the client is so low that, he in this case is not gonna say… Oh, but I have some better times. I need to help him notice and articulate some of those better times. 

02:06:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's that notion of kind of maybe someone's down, but they are not down to thousand or 100% of a time. If there's 99%, what's that 1%? And just a little light in there. 

02:07:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yep. 

02:07:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So… Okay. 

02:07:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN In another way I would approach that would be uh… you know, when are you most down and when are you least down? When you're just a little less down? Because people oftentimes don't want to say, oh, I feel up. But almost everybody can say, well, yeah, being at work was worse than watching T.V.. 

02:07:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So you think, in that typical day, seeing how there's some variation in that day. 

02:07:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:07:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So with what you learned about Omar. How would you use that moving forward? 

02:07:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I was struck and this was sort of between the lines. 

02:07:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:07:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I was struck by how lonely that he is. How alone he is. His typical day had no other humans in it. I have a hypothesis because I'm gonna use the idea of scientific mindedness. And so one hypothesis based on my assessment is that, he is suffering in part from uh… social isolation. He never mentioned anybody at work that he had any really good interaction with. He never mentioned anybody at work. Right? So we get this absence of… And maybe he's shut down a little bit because of this relationship that's ended. That's a hypothesis. 

02:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:08:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And then his inactivity is also another leap off the page. 

02:08:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

02:08:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This guy's got to move. 

02:08:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:08:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I also got the distinct impression, he's not even well. Sometimes he misses breakfast because he ruminates in bed too long. Lunch, I wasn't sure what he was having for lunch. He said he had a bite to eat when he got home and then hung out on the couch basically. He's got to move. He's got to eat some healthy food. Uh… got to get some positive social interactions. You think about depression. Those are three things that just pull people down. 

02:08:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. John, during today you show us a range of, of different strategies for assessment. And I think your last ones gonna pull it all together, in which you show us how to develop a case formulation and offering a collaborative treatment plan. 

02:09:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I hope to illustrate that. 

02:09:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON We'll see. 

02:09:15
Assessment Strategies 

02:09:15
Development a Case Formulation and Offering a Collaborative Treatment Plan 

02:09:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, how does case formulation pull together all the assessment strategies? 

02:09:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, assessment is useless, unless you use it. How's that for a profound statement. 

02:09:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON There you go. 

02:09:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… You know, we have to have a purpose for our assessment. And if you think about it uh…as a sort of a linear process, we get assessment. Assessment contributes to case formulation. Case formulation, case conceptualization is really all about… What do we think is, has caused the problem? What's sustaining or driving the problem that making it continue? If we can have a psychoanalytic case conceptualization, we can have a behavioral case conceptualization. Uh… And so that's gonna be dictated to be great extent by our theoretical orientation. Problem… I mean…. We… So we… So we start with assessment, we move to case formulation. And case formulation is what we're gonna use to make our treatment plan. So if I'm a cognitive therapist, I'm probably gonna focus on… What are the maladaptive cognitions that are making this person's life worse? If I'm an Adlerian, I'm gonna thinking umm… Now there is a basic mistake in the lifestyle and I need to both bring it to the person's awareness and give the person some activities to help, deal with and modify that basic mistake. 

02:10:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… Do you have any (inaudible ) keys to, to conducting kind of assessments case formulation treatment planning? 

02:11:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, again… For, for people, for students I would say, think about this as a big picture. Uh…back when I was in grad school, they gave us three or four sessions to do all this. Uh… Don't be too hard on yourself if you get out of a first session and you feel kind of fuzzy. Ideally you're gonna be able to say something to the client at the end of the session that feels like a pretty good fit for the client in terms of… Okay, what should we focus on next week and where are we going? 

02:11:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:11:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so if you just even get a general… that you just get a general idea of what to focus on, the general direction to go. That's fine. It's not in stone. We don't have to put our case formulation and treatment plan in stone. It's a good thing because that changes. And it changes sometimes session to session. And so I would say for students in particular, uh…young professionals. You know, you want to try your best to develop a case formulation treatment plan, but, but don't have too high of expectations. Get yourself a good general direction, a good start, and then keep thinking about it and keep tuning into the client and whether it's working for the client. 

02:12:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like uh… recognition that's an ongoing kind of, kind of process, continuing to add information, which kind of sharpens the case formulation, which then kind of sharpens the kind of treatment. But that, that on going… It's like being flexible, being open and just going to adding, adding into it. 

02:12:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Think about it from the client's perspective. 

02:12:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:12:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If the client is going to want to feel known, right? He's gonna want… So better leave the session like… My counselor gets me. So that's really when we think about case formulation, we want our counselor, out clients to say, yeah, my counselor gets me. 

02:12:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like, somebody's, one of the goals of that, then is to be able to, to give back to the client that recognition, that, you know, I, I, I do get you. 

02:12:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:12:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:12:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Here's what I hear. Here's what I see. Here's what I think is going on. 

02:12:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And it sounds like when that's done, done really well. You know, that's going again go back to that relationship, better collaboration, and it kind of all comes together. 

02:13:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. 

02:13:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I'd like to say, it's like boom. You just hit a home run. 

02:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:13:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's not like that. You know, it's usually notch forward, you get a little more insight, you get a little more clue as to whether or not what you're doing is really being helpful. And we make smaller steps toward uh… longer term progress. Uh… not the boom home run never happens. But we shouldn't have that necessarily as our expectation. 

02:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment, we're gonna see you work, work with Kayle. 

02:13:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:13:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you set this up for us? 

02:13:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So I'm gonna ask Kayle a question that I learned about when I was working with parents. I was the umm…executive director of a parenting education organization for many years. And uh…I discovered that, one thing that really helped was to ask the parents. What's your best explanation for why your son isn't doing his homework? 

02:13:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:13:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And the answers are just illuminating. And sometimes illuminating in a, in a terrifying way. And other times illuminating in like, well ,that's a really interesting. That's better than I could do. 

02:14:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

02:14:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… And so I'm gonna ask that question with the hope that I'm going to get something really interesting uh…and helpful from Kayle. But also understanding that she may not have much insight and she may have some really bad ideas. I remember some parents telling me. Well, my son is possessed. That's why he's not doing his homework. I was like, okay. I'm not sure where to go with that. 

02:14:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like, what we want to look for is kind of, how you invite her into that process. And then once she gives, you know, her perspective, kind of how you cope with that, how you deal with that and how you work with it. 

02:14:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:14:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

02:14:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Kayle, we've talked to some in our time together about what brings you down and what brings you up. Uh…and one of the things that has been pretty clear is that, when you go down, you go down pretty far sometimes, not all the time. Umm… And so. I have a question for you and that is, what is your best explanation, your best theory as to why the idea of a break up for example takes you down so low, takes your mood down so low? What's your best explanation for that? 

02:15:25
KAYLEIGH SOTO Umm… I think the main thing that comes to mind is uh…my dad leaving when I was uh…three months old. Umm… And just that idea of he didn't want me umm… kind of replays a lot in my life. I was raised by a single mom and I saw all the other kids with their dads and I just never understood why. Like, what did I do to deserve not having that? And so I think that's just kind of inner constant fear of, I've been abandoned once. But that's not based on that was supposed to love me, you know, that I'm their child. So why would anyone else choose to love me? 

02:16:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And so this has been a theme or theory or an explanation that sort of rumbles around under the surface for you and that it's like… If there's a possibility of someone rejecting you, not wanting to be with you umm… that brings up those old issues from being three months old. And of course three months old, not just three months old, but all the times you thought about it. 

02:16:40
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

02:16:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What do you suppose the odds are that uh… What are some other ways to think about the fact that you had a dad who left you at three months? I mean, one explanation that you've given is, he didn't want you or to be with you. I wonder if there are any other explanations for him leaving when you were three months? 

02:17:05
KAYLEIGH SOTO I mean, like he used try getting back in contact with me and tried to explain his side. And what he said was that, he felt that, he wouldn't make a good father and that he wouldn't be able to protect us. Uh… I guess there is like some abuse in his childhood and so he felt that we were better off with him not around. So I guess that could be a theory for, it doesn't, maybe it doesn't have to do with me. Maybe it had to do more with him. Umm… It's just really hard for me to kind of wrap my head around it. 

02:17:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, you can recognize that as a possibility. Umm…but your number one theory or explanation is, he didn't want to be with you. 

02:17:55
KAYLEIGH SOTO Uh-huh… 

02:17:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And that's a hard thing to go through life thinking and I can see where it would make the I idea of a boyfriend breaking up with you. It's sort of like it, in your mind, it affirms this belief that you have had uh… rubble around there. Yeah. So as we work together. Umm… One of the things I would like to do is to, is together umm… agree to go right after that, to go right after that explanation or belief you have about, why it's so painful to have a possible break up. Umm… I think one of the things we could have as a goal that's related to that is, is for you to be strong in the face of a possible break up, umm… instead of having it sort of break everything down and make you believe that you're unlovable or not wanted. Would that be something that you're okay working on directly? 

02:19:05
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah, I think it would be good. It would be helpful. 

02:19:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. One of the things I'm, I'm really impressed about with you is, your ability to just speak directly about this. Uh…not always easy. Uh…and it's not always going to be easy for us in our work together as we… If we just tackle that big belief that you hold under there and that… Right now in your life does not appear to be very useful for you. It doesn't seem to me and correct me if I'm wrong. That holding that belief, that maybe you are not the kind of person who want, people want to be with that, it just doesn't seem helpful. So is there anything about that? 

02:19:50
KAYLEIGH SOTO I mean, I think it's like kind of having my guards up. Umm… but not, it's not helpful. 

02:19:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. How would your life be different if you just didn't have that at all? If you just didn't have that belief? 

02:20:05
KAYLEIGH SOTO I mean, I'd be nice to not like I have to depend on another person for happiness. I just don't know how to do that. So I could imagine that if… Like I wouldn't go to self harm like during a fight like, I think that would be amazing. I just don't know how to get there. 

02:20:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This is new territory. 

02:20:25
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

02:20:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And that's one of the things that we can do in counseling. As we can explore some new territory. Maybe focus on some skills and strengths and some qualities that you have that can help cushion you in the face of a possible breakup that can make you strong in the face of that. Uh… So if it's okay with you. Our plan will be, we're gonna focus right in on that belief, that explanation that you have for why your boyfriend might not want to be with you and then nobody might want to be with you. We're gonna try to modify that, so that you're stronger in the face of a possible break up. And so I have a homework assignment for you. 

02:21:10
KAYLEIGH SOTO Okay. 

02:21:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're okay with that? 

02:21:10
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

02:21:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I sometimes think I shouldn't use the word homework. I have a project. 

02:21:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Okay… 

02:21:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… And the project is, I want you, during this next week, between this session and our next one and this is just an experiment, just to see if it possibly would work. I want you to, to just sort of try to notice. Whenever there's something about you that you think might make you desirable in a relationship. So, do you know what I mean? 

02:21:50
KAYLEIGH SOTO So, if, like I was single, something about me that would make, someone want to be with me? 

02:21:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If you're single or not single. 

02:21:55
KAYLEIGH SOTO Okay. 

02:21:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Even if you're with your boyfriend and then you think, oh, this is why he should want to stay with me, because I'm a good cook or because. I have nice hygiene or whatever it is that you have, that might make you a desirable positive person for somebody to have in his life. 

02:22:20
KAYLEIGH SOTO Okay. 

02:22:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And it's… This is sort of an informal assignment. I just want you to notice it and track it. Now if you have a notebook and you want to jot it down when it comes into your mind, all the better. If you fail at this, in other words you don't think of any reasons why. That's okay, because we're gonna take this head on next week. We're gonna jump right into it. And umm… and it's okay if you didn't think of anything because we'll start working on that here. But if you have a few things that you notice about yourself that are desirable qualities, uh… I would love to, to start there next week and focus in on those. 

02:23:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Okay. 

02:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? 

02:23:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. 

02:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. 

02:23:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO All right. 

02:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thanks, Kayle. 

02:23:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Thank you. 

02:23:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON John, is this, is this a typical way in which you work? 

02:23:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It is. You know, I, I have a belief that I think this best explanation question is something that we've neglected as counselors. We really want to get into, you know, what's down deep… What's the theory that our client has about his or her or their problems? 

02:23:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You know, its funny, John. You said, that I was thinking that, I probably don't ask that question that much either. You know, you, you get so focused on our own beliefs, on our own expertise and you forget, you know, that the reality is it's the client, it's client driven outcomes, right? The client's the one who's gonna collaborate and kind of and so why are we asking those questions? 

02:23:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, in, in… Yeah, I mean, also the clients carrying that explanation around. You know, we might be able to get to it even without asking. We might be able to uh…help the client develop a new and better theory for why the problems are happening. But why not, why not ask? 

02:24:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And it sounds like again, if this is what the clients walking around every day thinking, it's true, as heck we want to know what they are walking around every day thinking in terms of kind of what's generating these concerns and, and distrust what they have. 

02:24:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. 

02:24:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I noticed that uh… when you asked her for her best explanation. Uh… she said what she said. But what if her explanation is so different from yours? 

02:24:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… 

02:24:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It's so off the charts or so different from how you see the work. What do you do with that? 

02:24:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Well, you know, umm… that's tough. That's tough. Uh… General rule. Umm… You want to try to be respectful of even the most bizarre explanations and they come from somewhere. Umm…,you know, the, the parent who says my child is possessed. That comes from somewhere. Uh… And so we want to try to have compassion for it. We want to try to umm…not be disrespectful in the least. 

02:25:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

02:25:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… And so one of the ways I might do that is to say, okay, so that's one possibility. 

02:25:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:25:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So what I'm now wanting to model and teach is an experimental mindset. I want to say, okay. 

02:25:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It could be others. 

02:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Let's, let's put that on the table as a possibility. And now let's put this other one of the table as a possibility. Let's put this other one on the table. And let's you and I work together to try to figure out which of these has the best chance of helping you feel better, do better. 

02:25:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. I know, so in that clip you ask this question How would your life be different if you did not have that belief? You tell me more about that, where that comes from? 

02:25:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, that comes from a guy named Alfred Adler. You might have heard of him? 

02:25:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

02:25:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I, I didn't plan to ask that. I asked that because uh…it seemed… I just… I thought to myself… Is there any secondary gain here? 

02:25:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:25:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. You know, that's a secondary gain question. And you know what I mean? Secondary gain meaning… Is she having some kind of benefit from believing that she is not a desirable person to be around? Maybe that helps her get more attention, right? Maybe he gives her some power in relationships. So it's a secondary gain question. It's also maybe the, the roots of the miracle question in schools focus therapy. 

02:26:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Right. Right. Right. 

02:26:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… But I'm getting that, you know, how would her life be different and I just thought of it in the moment, it seemed important to ask that. 

02:26:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So the point of a question like that then would be, secondary gain. And also beginning to get a sense of kind of, maybe some intentional goals there. 

02:26:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

02:26:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:26:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, just like the miracle question. Of course, this is a question that gets people to focus on goals. 

02:26:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:26:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The question as Adler articulated it. Both can inform you about secondary gain and inform you about… Well, how life would be different than how you can maybe have that be reasonable goal. 

02:27:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And my hunch is that, because that comes from the client, it's, her generation of kind of how she sees that, that becomes again sometimes a collaborative treatment plan. 

02:27:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It can be incorporated into it. Yeah. 

02:27:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

02:27:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And just like her. Let's say, she has a terrible idea that the reason that she is not umm… desirable umm…other men besides her boyfriend or never will be again. You know, maybe she has some mystical idea. Just like that the… Her answer to the question, maybe we'll use that, maybe we'll discard that. Again I want to just have an experimental mindset, especially early in counseling because I don't know her very well. 

02:27:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

02:27:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

02:27:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And, as at the end you gave her homework too. 

02:27:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

02:27:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I'm wondering kind of how does homework flow out of assessment or, or fit with assessment or a treatment plan. 

02:27:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, you want to try to have some ideas for homework ahead of time. And I had some, but of course I wanted this to be relatively spontaneous with Kayle. And so I didn't know exactly where she was gonna be and what she's gonna do. So I gave a general homework assignment. I had an old psychoanalytic professor who told me, who said to class. He said, if you've got one homework assignment, it's N equals 1. You never want the person to fail. 

02:28:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:28:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So one of the ways that I tried to adapt that, if I'm gonna give a homework assignment and it's going to flow from the case formulation and it's going to move us toward the treatment plan or goals, I want the… her to know that there's no failing. 

02:28:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

02:28:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Even if you think you fail, you have not failed. 

02:28:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

02:28:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I wish I hadn't used the word failure, I did. It came out of my mouth. I wish I'd really back and I said, just, if you're not successful with this homework assignment, uh… that's perfectly okay, because it would be okay. It just gives us more information. It's, you know, for the assessment oriented of us, just more data. 

02:29:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, again you had an idea, it seemed to fit. Uh… but you also wanted to, to set it up so that, you know, if the client wants to do it, it's a successful outcome whether she does or not, but it adds the process. 

02:29:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to have a… If it's N equals 1, you never want to have, ever being negative or a failure experience. 

02:29:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. John, as we kind of, kind of wrap this up, I realize you work with a lot of clients today and you've talked a lot, a lot about your approach. Weren't just anything else you'd like to kind of close with? 

02:29:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I guess when I listen to you listen to me. Yeah. You know, I think uh…that I appreciate some of the ways that you've summarized the way that I work. And I do hope that I have lots of empathy for seeing things through the client's eyes. I hope that the counseling that I provide is collaborative. Uh… I hope it's positive, mostly strength based, even assessment which a lot of us are used to looking at problems. You know, I know we've said this. I'm, I'm now beating the drum maybe one too many times. But I appreciated all the ways that you listen to me. So thanks for that. 

02:30:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, John, I was thinking that you know often I think with, with, with counseling, we think about assessment as… this is very separate kind of process. That is, is different, than maybe the counseling component. You know, and I, and I think you really show how, how counseling is part of assessment. And the counselor, him or herself, you know, really is gonna approach this with empathy and strength based and growth oriented approach and that assessment really kind of helps become a much better counselor that the client actually gains and it's outcome of it. 

02:30:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. 

02:30:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Thank you much. 

02:30:35
