Core Transformation 

00:00:20
Connirae Andreas, PhD 

00:00:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS All right. Umm… Good afternoon. That's right, right? Good, I'm relatively well oriented. So umm… we have one hour. I think it's going to feel very short for me anyway. Umm… so I'll get right, right into it. I'm thinking some of you right there… The demo persons are gonna be right here, some of you may want to move over. But before you do… Actually wait on second on that. Before you do that or getting a few more people joining in, come and find the seat, I'm going to just tell you a little bit about what I'm gonna be doing. So for the purposes of you knowing if you wanna to volunteer and if, what you would like to work with would be appropriate for what I'm gonna be demonstrating today. I'm going to be demonstrating a particular method, it's the core transformation method. How many of you have heard of that? If you, very many of, you know, fair number, okay. All right, that's what I'll be demonstrating. And usually I teach this in three days and then lay frame, teaching frames for everyone at the beginning of the demonstration. But today I'm just gonna do a straight, uh… demonstration of how I would work with an individual client, who may not know anything about the background of the method. So, so we'll be building frames as we, as we go along with a demonstration. But ahead of time what I want you to know is that the core transformation method it, it's a way of working that can work affectively with a wide range of things including emotions. So it could be something like a feeling of jealousy, feeling of hurt, feeling anger, temper, uh… anything else, fill in the blank. Umm… it can be a useful way of working with uh… behaviors that people are not so happy with. For example, umm… compulsive… Sometimes I've worked with people who, you know, I just crave sweets, I'm in the checkout line at the supermarket and I can't stop myself, I just grab them and buy them and eat them. So we can work with that, we can work with nail-biting, umm… any other behavior that someone has that they don't want to have. So I hope that gives you a bit of a picture of possibility, the range of options. Umm… it also, it's a gentle method, it's a kind method, it's a method that is not content based. So that if we… I will ask of the people who volunteer just a sentence or two, a little bit about what you want to work with, uh… so that I can get a sense of, is this appropriate, does this make sense for this method? Umm… but, but I won't ask for all kinds of details about it umm… and you won't need to, you won't need to share that. Umm… anything else I… I think that might be enough. Yes, you have a question. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN Oh, no, it's not the question. 

00:03:20
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Oh, okay. Yes. So who would like to volunteer? Who has something like that? 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:03:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS It, it can be. What I'd like you just to have, as a start… Thank you for asking that. What I'd like you to do is as a starting place because we have such a short amount of time, I would like to work with somebody who is already sorted a particular… I'm gonna call it a part that you want to work with. So it would be umm… Are you gonna raise your hand after all? He's, he's going back and forth so far. So, umm… yes, several people here. But, but before we go with, with that, I want you to know it would be helpful if you have it sorted so that you could phrase it, as I have a part that excess. I have a part of me that gets angry. I get angry sometimes and I want to work with that or I have this feeling, or have this particular behavior. If it's a weight issue, we would need to know the starting place. We would need to know enough to know the starting place yet. If somebody says, I have a craving for sweets, and when I'm at the checkout line I can't stop myself from buying them, we have a starting place. Umm… but if it's broader than that, it would take a little information gathering, sorting to tease out what's the part we're going to work with. If somebody goes, I, I… You know, I have to bite my nails, we know what the behavior is and we work with the part that makes me bite my nails. Does that make sense? It can work with shyness, it can work with a lot of things. It's helpful if you know the time and place when you experience either the behavior or the feeling that you want to work with. Is that help? Okay, so, so now for volunteer. You an volunteer? You know, the method, all right? Okay, this is… If we have somebody who doesn't know the method that would be my first choice because it would be cheating a little bit I think, although I'd love to work with Brian, but are you going to volunteer? 

00:05:20
NICKY Yes, please. 

00:05:20
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Oh, yeah, okay. All right. And what is it that you have that you want to work with? 

00:05:25
NICKY It's jealously. 

00:05:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, come on up. Okay, so you have already have something that you'd like to work with, right, and it's jealousy? 

00:05:35
NICKY Yeah, it's jealously. 

00:05:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS And I forgot your… I need my, the… My therapist tools that I always have when I have a session or my notepad, a pen, and a box of Kleenex. You know, just as backup in case. And most sessions actually don't need the box of Kleenex but every session I need my notepad and my paper, uh… because for this particular process, there's a certain, umm… a certain kind of precise tracking that I do, uh… that it's just easier if I use my paper to remember and I don't have to hold it all in my conscious mind. Umm… now I'm going to… Could I know your name? 

00:06:15
NICKY Yeah, it's Nicky. 

00:06:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Nicky? 

00:06:15
NICKY Yeah. 

00:06:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay. And I'm Connirae, I don't have my name tag in there anymore. 

00:06:20
NICKY Nice to meet you. 

00:06:20
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Nice to meet you, Nicky. And so, Nicky, I'm going to be probably from time to time turning to the group and saying some things to them. And, and most of the time it'll be you and I talking together. 

00:06:35
NICKY Cool. 

00:06:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, and occasionally I may look here at my clock. 

00:06:35
NICKY Thanks for warning me. 

00:06:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS So I know where I am in the hour. Umm… Okay, fantastic. So we're beginning. Nicky already has selected something that he'd like to work with and that's jealousy, is that correct? 

00:06:50
NICKY That's right, yeah. 

00:06:50
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay. So uh… when can you… You actually don't have to tell me but if you're okay, telling me when do you experience this. If you're okay with the contexts, if not we'll just… Okay. 

00:07:00
NICKY Yeah, so it happens when my friends do really well that I felt jealous. 

00:07:00
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, when my friends do really well I feel jealous. And there are the ones volunteering you for this? 

00:07:10
NICKY They are… typically there. It's in the best interest for me though. 

00:07:10
CONNIRAE ANDREAS They, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, I hope I meet your expectations or hopes here, we'll see. We'll see how it goes, okay. So when your friends do well you feel, it's jealousy. Is this something that will make a difference to you to not just your friends? 

00:07:30
NICKY Oh, it's, it's all for me, yeah. 

00:07:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, good, good. 

00:07:35
NICKY Well, I'm hoping it will affect their lives too. 

00:07:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS All right. Great, great. So and, so you got the context. When you, when your friends do really well, the next step is really to, to elicit the experience right now in real time. So when your friends do really well, can you think back to a time when that happened? 

00:07:50
NICKY Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:50
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, and then what happens in your experience? If you put yourself back into that time you see… Yeah, you, he's already doing it quite quickly. Then what's your experience? 

00:08:00
NICKY Oh, I, I get more into my head. Like I, I feel less in touch with my body. 

00:08:10
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:08:10
NICKY And then I, I start getting paranoid thoughts. 

00:08:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, less in my body, more in my head and I start getting paranoid thoughts. Okay, paranoid thoughts like what? 

00:08:20
NICKY Not like psychotic thoughts. No, I don't mean, like paranoid… It's like that… I just meant, some, like I have thoughts about like, umm… like I might not good enough, uh… what is to say about me. 

00:08:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:08:35
NICKY Yeah, that kind of thing. 

00:08:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, okay. So there's a little bit of a choice point about how we talk about and think about the part that we're gonna work with. It might be the part that, that uh… moves you out of the body and into the head that might would be one way of thinking about it. And it might be the part that has these thoughts. You know, what did you say? You're not good enough that kind of thing? 

00:08:55
NICKY Yeah, that type of thing. 

00:09:00
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah, you're… Is that an inner voice that you have? 

00:09:05
NICKY I think it's like discursive thoughts, it's probably the best way of… 

00:09:05
CONNIRAE ANDREAS It's what? 

00:09:05
NICKY Discursive thoughts. 

00:09:10
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Discursive thoughts. Discursive thoughts. What kind of are those? 

00:09:15
NICKY Like just the thoughts that I'm not… 

00:09:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Not quite. 

00:09:15
NICKY They, they don't quite resonate with me. 

00:09:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Uh-huh… Okay, okay. All right, so and when you have those thoughts, uh… where is the, where is the experience of those thoughts? 

00:09:25
NICKY It feels very much like at the top of my scalp. 

00:09:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Right here on the top of your scalp. Now I'm gonna go back and ask when you have the thoughts, is that a voice, you had another word, is it a voice or is it an image you see or what's the experience of the thoughts themselves? 

00:09:40
NICKY Yeah, it is like, it is like a voice. 

00:09:40
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Like a voice, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. For most of us that's how it works. We have these inner voices that say things to ourselves and so on. And it's how we get through the day off or its part of it. It's like okay, time to have breakfast or whatever but then sometimes the inner voice goes, umm… you're not good enough and that's not necessarily as much fun to have an inner voice, right? Okay, so that, that would be the easiest part to work with, the one that goes you're not good enough, because it's right here easy to access and experience. So I think that's gonna be the best place to start. It's possible that there's another experience that comes a bit sooner that goes with this experience of moving out of the body and to the head. And can you feel that happening before the thoughts happen or is that the thoughts happen at the same time or first? 

00:10:30
NICKY No, I think I moved out of… Like I feel less grounded. 

00:10:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS I feel less grounded, okay. So if you tune inward for a moment, you just turn inward and welcome. What we do then, as we, we welcome the part that we want to work with. And I'm still not clear exactly which one I'm gonna choose as we move in and how we're gonna talk about it. But as you… Yeah, let your eyes close and turn inward and just notice what you notice there. This feeling of, of moving out of my body, into my head, feeling less grounded. But it makes sense to you to think about this as the part of me that makes me move out of my body and to my head and feel less grounded. Does that… Can you… Does that make some sense to you? 

00:11:15
NICKY What do you mean? 

00:11:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS The part of me that makes me move out of my… It's not something… When we do things like this, there are a lot of things that we're doing consciously, we're not intentionally… You, you probably don't intentionally move out of your body, into your head, right? 

00:11:30
NICKY No. 

00:11:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS So it's, as if there's some unconscious part of you that just does that automatically without you're trying, right? 

00:11:35
NICKY Yeah. 

00:11:40
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay. So now if you turn inward in you, welcome that part, where is your sense of, where that part is located right now? Okay, great. Right here in the chest. So he can find that fairly quickly and fairly easily, lovely. So take a moment and just welcome that and sometimes the welcoming, sometimes what feels welcoming for people is to even put a hand towards the body and the locations where it is, yeah, if that feels welcoming. And when we welcome the part with this work, it's welcoming in the sense of umm… realizing that there's some positive purpose that this part has. We don't necessarily know what it is, most likely we don't. But that it has a positive intention. Does that make sense to you already? Okay, now if it doesn't, we would go into that more of it. He had already make sense to him that this has a positive purpose, okay. And can you congruently welcome that part now? Okay, great, great. Because usually we spent trying to push aside these parts and get rid of them or just not notice them and kind of override them. But now we're sort of doing the opposite, we're turning in and we're welcoming, we're creating the space for it. We're really going to attend to it, and what's perhaps a new way, and perhaps a way, may not ever have been attended to before. So, okay, great. And as you do that, in a moment I'm going to ask you to ask this part of you a question. And when you do that, you will ask the question and just notice what answer comes to you, okay. From this, it might come from this area, it'll be from this part, not something that you need to figure out. It make sense? Okay. So the question is, I'd like you to ask this part of you. What do you want? And just wait and let the question sit there. What do you want? And just wait for the answer, just like you would wait for the answer if you ask that of another human being or another person, just wait. And the answer can sometimes come in a feeling, sometimes the answer can come in words, or an image, or somehow, sometimes it's a knowing and we're not quite sure how we got to knowing, but the answer just comes. And so what were you aware of when you asked the question? 

00:13:55
NICKY Safety. 

00:13:55
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Pardon? 

00:13:55
NICKY Safety. 

00:13:55
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Safety. Excellent, excellent. So, and could you all hear that? Okay, good. So it's safety. So thank the part for letting you know that. And we all have parts that want safety and most, and we're happy to have parts that want safety, right? Are you pleased to have a part that wants safety for you? So you can thank it for letting you know and you can also thank it for wanting safety for you, wanting you to be safe. Yeah, and so now what we're gonna do is, invite this part, it wants safety. We're going to invite it to step in to what it would be like to have safety fully and completely the way that this part wants it. So, yeah, we just invite this part to step in. And when these parts want something like safety, it, we might not understand, we might have consciously one idea of what that means but it's important to recognize that our inner parts always have their own idea of that. So as you just turn inward now, what we're inviting is, this part to step into its own desire what it wants, when it says safety, it's stepping into what it wants by that. And oftentimes also these parts want something that's beyond what's really "Possible" or "Realistic," I'm putting those things in quotes here. But it's important and useful in this process to let the part step in fully to what it wants irrespective of whether it's possible or not. And this is for, for… Is that okay with you? Okay, great, great. So you can just let the part in, as that part already stepped in toward it's like to have the safety it wants. Yeah, great, great. So the next step now is thank the part and ask and when you have this safety fully and completely the way you wanted, then what do you want through having safety that is even deeper, even more important? Yeah, that's right. And then when you get an answer, you can let me know what that is. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS And have you gotten an answer yet? Okay, now my unconscious says, telling me that you got an answer already and I could be wrong, I could be mistaken or it's possible that an answer did come up that you just didn't notice or recognize. So what I'd like to ask is, when you went inside and asked what do you, when you have this safety, what do you want through having safety that's even deeper and more important, than what happened, what experience, what happened, what experience occurred? 

00:17:00
NICKY Just the word stillness. 

00:17:05
CONNIRAE ANDREAS The word stillness, okay. Now did that come up before and you rejected it for some reason? Okay, and I'm just curious why you rejected if there's a reason, you just thought it be something else? 

00:17:15
NICKY Mm-hmm. 

00:17:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, great, great. Okay, thank you. Okay, stillness. Okay, safety. Here I have my notepad and I forgot to write. Safety and stillness. Okay, wonderful. So thank the part for letting you know that. And thank the part for wanting stillness for you. Yeah, and then invite this part to step in to what it would be like to have this stillness fully and completely the way this part wants it. That's right, just let this part really step in to what it's like to have this stillness fully and the way that it's wanted. Yeah, and then ask, when you have this stillness fully, completely, is there anything even deeper, even more that's wanted through stillness, that's even more important, even more core? 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah and what do you get? 

00:18:25
NICKY To be loved. 

00:18:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS What? 

00:18:25
NICKY To be loved. 

00:18:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS To be loved. Okay, excellent, to be loved. Okay, thank the part for letting you know that. Yeah, and for wanting that for you. And now invite this part to step in to what it's like to be loved, what it would be like to be loved fully, fully and completely, the way this part wants to be loved. And again this is beyond what's possible, totally what's wanted. We're following, we're following the direction of this part seeking what it's really striving for. So, yeah, let it step in to what it would be like to be loved fully, the way this part wants. That's right, and when the part is there, then we can ask, then we're in a position to know. Until the part steps in, it's harder for it, it, it may not even be in touch with what it wants through that. But once the part is stepped in, it, it's easy for the, to receive the next revelation of what is wanted through this. So, yeah, so now ask, when you have this to be loved fully and completely the way you wanted, then what do you want through to be loved that is even more, even deeper, even more core? That's right. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:20:10
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah, what happens when you go inside and ask that question? 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:25
NICKY I just feel relaxed. 

00:20:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS You feel really relaxed. Yeah, yeah, okay. And in that relaxation, that is probably the answer to this next. So would that make sense that this is the answer to, to be relaxed? 

00:20:40
NICKY And spacious. 

00:20:45
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Pardon? 

00:20:45
NICKY Spacious. 

00:20:45
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Spacious, okay. Spacious. Okay, relaxed and then spacious is more a true word for it. And when we, when we get to this stage, it's often difficult for people to find words that adequately express the experience they're having. So it can be useful to acknowledge that, that we're, that we're, uh… being, the word is just a way to remember the experience, but it's really the experience we're speaking of. And this experience have subtlety for him that is, that is unique and we can't quite fit it into any word. Okay, great. So thank this part for letting you know this and for wanting this for you. And then, that's right. Yes, and then invite this part to step in to what it's like to feel this relaxed spacious feeling. This relaxed, spacious, yeah, fully and completely to be experiencing this, the way this part wants it. That's right. And then when this part is… That's right. Fully experience this spacious relaxed, then we ask. And when you have this relax, spacious experience, is there anything even deeper wanted through, through this, that even more core, even more important, even more and you can take sometime to let this part notice. So, and with this work by the way I tend to go along with him to some extent, because that makes it easier for me to offer the guiding in a, in a, in a way that fits with his experience and it also makes it quite and nice experience for me. That it is umm… an experience along with him to the core of what's wanted in a quite nice and special way. Okay, so you're, you're invited to also do that if you would like or track things more outwardly, however it fits for you. Okay, so and what do you get as you're enjoying, as this part has stepped into this relaxed spacious, that's right. When you have this, is there anything even deeper, even more and what happens, yeah. Yeah. What do you get? 

00:23:10
NICKY I don't, I don't feel like I even have skin. 

00:23:20
CONNIRAE ANDREAS What? 

00:23:20
NICKY I, I don't feel like there's any barriers. 

00:23:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS I don't feel like there's any barriers. Right, is that right? So what you said, okay. I have a little hearing trouble, so that's why sometimes I ask more than other people might. Okay, no barriers. Yeah, yeah and that looks like you like that. Okay, great. Umm… so great. Let this part step in and then this experience of no barriers and all that, that means an experience. Yeah, let the part really step in and enjoy this no barriers, no barriers fully and completely. And then ask, when you have this, also this no barriers fully, completely the way that it's wanted, is there anything you this part want through this, there's no barriers, that is even deeper, even more core. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:45
CONNIRAE ANDREAS And what happens when you ask that question? 

00:24:50
NICKY There's a lot of light. 

00:24:50
CONNIRAE ANDREAS What? 

00:24:50
NICKY A lot of light. 

00:24:55
CONNIRAE ANDREAS A lot of light. Okay, there's a light, light, a lot of light. So thank the part, invite the part to step in to this experience of light, of a lot of light fully, completely the way it's wanted. And ask, when you have this also this experience of a lot of light. Is there anything even deeper, even more wanted through this? And there doesn't have to be, we're close to the, we're close to what I call a core stay, and, and we're likely to be, this might be yet or there might be more. So I just let either, either as an option. Umm… at some point when people turn inward and keep asking this question, "what do you want through that, what do run through that?" There's a shift into a state of being. And sometimes there are several states of being like several of these are already states of being that we are, that we are getting, that he is getting from his part. So it's a state of being and then it all, but we let the part go, if it keeps wanting something deeper and it has something even more that it wants. We go and tell the part goes. Now that's it, that's really it, that is totally fully, completely what I'm seeking, what I've been seeking, then we're there. So you can let me know, does this part go, yeah, there's a lot of light, this is it or is there something? Okay, so this is it. Yeah, okay, great. So thank this part for wanting this for you. Yeah, yeah and for having this, this is the part it turns out, that is, has the wisdom and resource about this, this particular state of being. We could try to step into this kind of thing through meditation but that would be the hard way. When it turns out that the, that the easy doorway is through our limitations, through the things that we think stop us and hold us back. That when we keep going through the, through the layers of what these parts want, we inevitably, inevitably end up at what I call a core state of being, that's this sort of, we could talk about this is a kind of essence and people have different ways of relating to this. Yeah, you can just enjoy that as we talk a bit. Umm… perhaps I'll say a little bit more to you after, after we're done, because he's, he totally gets it, the part totally gets it. So we can just honor that and go with that. Now what I want to say to you, Nicky, and to this part is that, our part somehow get the idea that they want something, they want something that is really fundamental and basic to our being like, like this a lot of light is, can this, can this sound be turned off whatever that is? It's outside, okay. All right, maybe somebody can find it a way to… Yeah, thank you. All right. So, so yeah, so our parts want to get to this state of being and, and our parts at the unconscious level thought that they had to go through a certain sequence to get there. So this thought part, what it really wants is this being in the light, lots of light. But a thought, it's as if it thought at the unconscious level. Okay, so if I want that, the way to get there, let's see, I first have to start with umm… this jealousy thing. You know, I've got to make the move, move the consciousness out of the body into the head and then and then from there. And then, and then I have to make sure I'm safe, you know. And there were, these ideas of this whole sequence had to be gone through in order to get to that destination. And the only problem with that is, it doesn't work. That's it, right? I mean, how often does it work? We try feeling jealous. For some reason it doesn't get us to feeling in the light, the way we want to. So and that is because the, the first out comes, the first outcomes are usually about doing things in the world and getting things from the world, to put it really simply. And then, and then through this, if we track what's wanted, there's always a shift from doing and getting to something that's just being, something that's independent of, of doing and getting. So if we track deep enough what's wanted, we always get there. Then I didn't know this when I first started, umm… when this method came to me. The first person that I worked with and I just, I just had this intuition. We should keep going deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper. And then it popped out this sort of… I want peace and I could see it was a really strong state. And, and then, then there's the healing that we do with it and that's next. So the good news about it, is that the way their parts thought to get there doesn't work, but the way that does work is so much simpler actually. Because the only way to get into a state of being is to just step in and enjoy it, that is it, that is the only way, it's the one and only way. So now we could try consciously to do that but it wouldn't work in the same way. This is the part that knows that state, this is the part that wants that state, this is the part that has the capacity to do it. So ask that part, "would you like to start at the end, and start with what you want and just step in and have this being in the light as a way of being, as a beginning, as a way of moving through the world, just because you like it. Yeah, okay. Good, good. That part says, yes. 

00:30:45
NICKY Mm-hmm. 

00:30:45
CONNIRAE ANDREAS So great. So we invite now for this part to go ahead and step in, even more if that's possible, to what it's like to just have this big, lots of light, this experience, to just have this as a way of being, as a way of beginning, as a way of moving through the world. And invite this part to experience how, when you already have this being in the light, as a way of being, that's right. How already having this allows things to be different and you can just let that happen, how it happens. By the way, those of you frantically taking notes, there, you can access these steps umm… online. There, there is a free intro that has another demo where you can take notes, there, there's a book there, it's all, there are detailed notes available too if you wanted. What you can't get there is the live demo you know, at least in the book. So… Unless that… Some people taking the notes it's just a great way for the unconscious to be distracted and let things really go in. So if you're one of those people and I'm one of those sometimes then do feel free to keep taking notes. Yeah, okay. So great. Great. So has the part had time to do that? Wonderful. So now we invite this part to experience, how already having this being in the light, lots of light, as a way of being, as a beginning, how this naturally flows through and transforms the experience of no barriers. Yeah, and just allows that to go how it does when being in the light is already there. That's right, it can just flow through, enrich, color, however naturally happens. And that's the key that it goes, how goes, it does what it does, there's no effort in this, it's an allowing of it to happen however it naturally happens. Yeah, whatever it does, it does, whatever it doesn't do, doesn't do and that's all fun. So, yeah, so that's right. And as that continues to enrich and integrate at the unconscious level, we invite this part to experience how already being, experiencing this lots of light as the way of being, a way of beginning, moving through the world, how, already having this flows through transforms and enrich this relaxed spacious experience. Yeah, what that's like, what it's like to relax when this light is already there? What is like to experience spacious when the light is already there? That's right. That's right. And you can allow that to really flow through all the way through that experience. Yes. And as that continues to integrate at the unconscious level, we invite this part to experience how already having this being in the light, lots of light as a way of being, naturally flows through and transforms and enriches the experience of being loved, to be loved. Yeah, what it's like to be loved when the, being in the light is already there? And it's something we can't predict but when the part steps in, is already in there, in that light and it's experiencing this being loved. Uh… Uh… It's just experience differently. Sometimes it's, that the love is, is, can be… It has a landing place, you know. Whereas, if we're loved and there's, this is not there, often times it's not in the same landing place. So but, we each have our unique way and I don't know exactly how it is for Nicky. It is however it is. Yeah. And then, yeah, as this continues to integrate and deepened, we invite this part to experience also how when, being in the light, experiencing the light is already there as a way of being. How this transforms and enriches also an experience where another person may not be capable of offering love in the moment. Yeah, so we invite this part to just let to discover what that's like also and how that's also different when the light is already there. That's right. Yes. Yeah. And has a part had time to really understand that at the unconscious level? That's right. Exactly what needs to be understood. And we invite this part to also experience how when being in the light is already there as a way of being, how this naturally flows through and enriches the experience of stillness. Yeah, letting that be however it is, when being in the light is already there. That's right. Yeah, because each of these things is different when the being in the light is already there. And as that continues to integrate and flow through, we invite this part to experience how, when being in the light is already there as a way of being. How this transforms, this whole domain of safety? Yeah. And without thought just letting and do whatever it does, when there's lots of light is already there, just whatever happens in this whole experience of safety. And the part may begin to notice how when the light is already there, the no barriers are already there, the relax, spacious is already there. How, maybe even easier to sense and look out for safety in a very practical and specific way. As well as when the light is there already has a way of being, that the whole thought about safety, it just isn't the same thing anymore. 

00:37:30
[sil.] 

00:37:35
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah, and that can continue to transform itself, however it does. Yeah. With that being in the light already there. Yeah. yeah, and as that continues to deepen and integrate, we invite this part to experience how, when being in the light is already there as a way of being, as a beginning, as a way of moving through the world. How this transforms the situation where before you might have had that old response. One of these situations where a friend does well and what is it like when a being in the light is already there as a of being? And it can just be a curiosity, "what is it like?" And I'm noticing how is it when being in the light is already there? 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
CONNIRAE ANDREAS That's right. Yeah. And I'm just going to check, is it, is it uh… comfortable for you? How it is now being with, being in the light already there, what is it like? Perhaps it's a good time for you to let me know with words if that's okay with you? Yeah. So how is it now when you're being in the light, already there? A friend that has some good news of some sort, and what's it like for you to learn of that? 

00:39:20
NICKY It's nice. 

00:39:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS It's, what? 

00:39:25
NICKY It's nice. 

00:39:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS It's nice. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And you can check, this part can check in another situation also and, what another friend has good news and when this being in the light is already there, what is this like? Yeah. And you can begin checking in one more situation while your unconscious mind checks in, perhaps three more, perhaps five more, it could even be 50 more situations that your unconscious checks, I don't really know. Because you'll be just checking in this one situation at the conscious level that you're aware of, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. It's nice to be able to enjoy that experience along with a friend, isn't it? When the being in the light is already there, yeah. Okay. So what we're going to do now is because this part could probably hangout here for a while and really enjoy it, right? He's having a good time and so is the part having a good time, you know. And when, when I teach people to do this kind of work on their own as a practice, then I let people, umm… I let people know it can be useful to just hangout here for a while. You don't have to rush on, you can enjoy this, because this is very healing to the nervous system on a physical level as well as an emotional level, to just enjoy this experience. And of course after the experience, the way we're doing, the part now knows that it can do this as a beginning, as an ongoing way through, of moving through life. So actually, every moment of life is a part of that meditation going forward. There's just increasingly the experience of what it's like to live out of this. So it's not something that one even necessarily needs to do at a separate time during the day because, the living of life becomes the expression of that. So yes… So what we're going to do because we have umm… just about 10 more minutes now. Is there's… There are a few more things that we can do with this. And umm… my inclination is… What I'd like to do is just one, one simple piece, which we talk about as growing upper apart. Sometimes our parts that have a sense of being at a younger age in time, and what I'd like to you to do is ask this part of you that has this light as a gift, as a core state, "how old are you and just notice what answer you get." 

00:42:25
NICKY Eight. 

00:42:25
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Eight? Did you say eight? Okay, great, great. So thank this part and ask this part, "would you like to have this experience of having being in the light already there as a way of being at that eight year old age and be able to grow up to evolve through time?" Because at the age eight, these, these parts don't have the wisdom of all, our learning's and experience that we've gained through the years of life since then. But if they, they have, once they have the core state, they have the capacity due to easily grow up through time and join us. And then they have access to all of our wisdom and experience as well as it can give us even more fully this gift of being in the light. So with this part like to have that experience of having this being in the light as a way of being back at that eight year old time, okay, great. And then you, we just invite this part stepping in at eight to being in the light fully and completely. This part, you are invited to just… That's right, grow up evolve all the way through time, all the way through to current age, letting all the experiences be transformed and changed, how they are with being in the light already there as a way of being. 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:43:55
CONNIRAE ANDREAS And you can let me know. Just nod your head when you sense the part, is that current age? 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:05
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, good, good, good. And now where in space in this moment, do you sense this part is located? It was in the chest area, is it still there or is it somewhere else now? Maybe it's everywhere? Maybe it's in front of you? Where is the part with the being in the light now? 

00:44:30
NICKY I don't feel it. 

00:44:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Pardon? 

00:44:30
NICKY I don't feel it. 

00:44:30
CONNIRAE ANDREAS I don't feel. Okay, so it means, he doesn't feel the old response. And what, and so, and that fits, he's concurring about that. What I want to find out now is where is this part that has the being in the light resource? So it's really where's the one that just grew up with the being in the light? And maybe he's saying don't feel it, because it's already fully integrated. But is there a place that you feel this part more strongly, this one with the being in the light that just grew up to current age? 

00:45:00
NICKY The top of my, the roof of my mouth. 

00:45:05
CONNIRAE ANDREAS The roof of my mouth, most strongly there. Okay, lovely. Okay, so now let's just check in. Is that where this being in the light it's felt most strongly? Okay, great. So then just feel for, whether the whole body… Is there a welcoming through the whole body mind system of this being in the light experience? Okay, so then it can be allowed to be flowing through the whole body mind. Yeah, flowing through, radiating through, everywhere that it's welcomed. Yeah, that's right. And often people do shift their posture like you just did to accommodate for this experience, the core state to be fully present throughout the whole body mind. Yeah, great, great. Thank you. That's wonderful. Yeah, and as that continues to integrate… Yeah, and this, this integration that's happening now, now we started with a part that was experienced in a certain location. Once we go to the core state of being, we're in a position for deep transformation and we're in a position for a deeper kind of integration that we can get if we don't go to the core state level of experience. Once we're at something like being in the light, generally there's no part of us that has any objection to this, you know. So it's like, oh, yeah, I'm, I'm happy to have this through my whole body. At that time, this part is now welcome everywhere, usually, most of the time. Sometimes there are objections and we have ways of working with that, that just means another part, another core state, even more goodies in a way. It's, it's… There can't be a uh… This, this process is very inclusive of whatever happens. It all, it all, it was just a useful aspect of the whole that we get to. So, so yeah, letting this be fully felt throughout the whole body mind system. And then you can just again, with this being in the light fully through the whole body mind, again enjoy exploring what is it like now to experience when my friend has something good happened for them. And just notice now that even more enriched experience, perhaps a fuller experience of the, yeah, of the, the reflecting that good news from them or enjoying it, taking it in, however you might describe it or experience it. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Okay. And you can enjoy that as long as you want to and whenever you feel okay, this is enough integration time, you can just allow your eyes to open. And while you're sitting there or enjoying in a bit, I'm gonna talk to the, to the others and they may ask me a few questions. So, yeah, but there's no rush for you, you can just enjoy as long as you like. Yeah. Okay, so we have just five minutes. And so, so we're gonna close about five minutes early, so that the next person has a tiny break. Is there a question or two before, umm… Is, you… I've been explaining a little bit as I'm going along, what we're doing here. So and he is, he is demonstrating quite eloquently non-verbally, umm… how the process works. It tends to be a trance state of its own. We're not doing any induction but you can see how deep he's gone. And umm… so, so he's going particularly deep quickly, not everyone goes that deep that fast. And it's fine in both ways. It can get a dramatic shift whether or not someone does that on the first time. I just worked with a client, umm… I won't go into all the details because I don't have time, but the second time through he's going, "oh, I'm so glad we did this a second time because now I'm really getting it." So sometimes it's that repetition that allows the person to begin to access really deeply. But what I'd like to just point out though is that, with this kind of work… If there's enough clarity about what we need to access and what we need, what questioning we need to do, what path we need to follow, so that the trance itself is the healing. It's not that we need to do a separate trance state and then within that do something healing. They're both happening simultaneously. Yeah, one question there. Is there a mic for him? Oh, just speak loudly. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Oh, he's obviously quite interested and anxious to, to be involved in this and participate? 

00:50:00
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah, I'm not sure if I'd say anxious to participate, but he seems quite interested. Yes, yes. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN He's, he's got some drives, motivations. What are, a couple your comments about someone who's more resistant? 

00:50:15
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, umm…. nobody is resistant. If, if they come to you… Uh… now, if, if you're trying to impose it on a husband, wife, friend, you know, I wasn't sure at first because he's going, his friends volunteered, like you'd see they were joking back there, every time like volunteer, volunteer. But I could see that he was also ready to, to act on his own behalf, so that's why I went with that. Umm… If somebody comes to you… Are you in a position where you, are you treating court-ordered people, or you in a position where people come to you or what? 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN I work in a prison umm… 

00:50:50
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Okay, there we have it, there we have it. Good, good, thank you, thank you. You know, we have a blog post about, where a chaplain used this in prison uh… with a guy who was about to kill somebody and he probably prevented a murder right there. Umm… what he did was very… He did it conversationally, he artfully engaged the guy with what he wanted. You know, he could see that the man was, the man was speaking… I don't remember the details fully anymore, but the man was speaking, he was so pissed off. A particular guard had disrespected him. I believe it was a guard, it was somebody in this prison scene who had disrespected him. And he was gonna, you know, and he had the opportunity, he had the, he had kind of a plan. Umm… and, but this person would go, so what would it do for you to basically off him? You know, so, so we start with what he wanted. You want, "what will it do for you if you are able to do that?" You know, will I get some respect? You know, you know, I want respect. What's the, the part of you that wants to kill him, what's, what is it want? Respect, that was that right off the first thing. Respect is one of the first answers for a lot of these bullying and a lot of uh… violent offense, it comes in there quite often. Umm… and then we're all great. If you have respect what would… And you, you deserve respect. And if you had respect, what would that get you that you really want through Respect? And then we're often rolling the guy got to a really deep state, I forgot what it was, but he no longer cared about anything, other than just enjoying his state. He was not so interested anymore. And it didn't have to be expressed in that same old way. So thank you for bringing that up. It's a matter of allying with what the person wants. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:40
CONNIRAE ANDREAS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Do you mean that this process goes further that what we, we would consider to be therapy in and even goes into direction of that line and length and, and those kind of…. 

00:52:55
CONNIRAE ANDREAS You know, it's… I want to thank you for bringing that up. Does it? I think, yes, it does and we don't have to take it there and the client doesn't necessarily take it there. He's going into these states of, you know, spacious, being, you know, he's, you can see that. For some clients it come… And for me, for, for each of us, if we do this kind of work as a personal practice, I've experienced times when I'm more in his domain, what he's doing, and other times when I get, it's very ordinary stuff that these parts want. It doesn't sound, it's just respect, just being safe, being loved, being okay, that's it. And that's, that's good enough. You know, it doesn't have to be about enlightenment or something mystical or fancy or spiritual. But I did, when I started doing this work with people, I started having people tell me almost like they were telling me a secret. Are you aware that's a spiritual process? You know, and, and I'd go, and at that point I hadn't experienced that side of it myself. For me I was experiencing the Monday inside first quite a while before I… So I was thinking, fine, however you want to think about it, it's fine with me, I don't mind, you know. I'm just following their experience. However they want to think about is okay. And so it's inclusive of however the client experiences it. I have had atheists though I have parts that want oneness with God as their core state, that is also fine. And then I have also had people who are on big time spiritual trips, where their core states are very ordinary, and they were… And it's whatever we're inclined to dismiss, it shows up. You know, whatever we've been thinking we needed to exclude or bury ourselves from, it shows up. Yeah, thank you and I think we're, we're out of time, we're definitely out of time. So thank you all. And thank you very much…
