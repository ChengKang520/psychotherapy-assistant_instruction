ALEXANDER STREET PRESS HAWAII ACA 2014 Conference & Expo Aca Counseling in Action Demonstration Series Counselors Responding to Mass Violence Following a University Shoothing: A Live Demonstration of Crisis Counseling Stephanie F. Dailey, Jane Webber, J. Barry Mascari 

00:00:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY My name is Stephanie Dailey. I'm an assistant professor at Argosy University and an active disaster reponsor-- responder within the DC capital region. My colleagues. 

00:00:25
JANE WEBBER Good morning. I'm Jane Webber. I'm an assistant professor at Kean University and a New Jersey licensed Disaster Response Crisis Counselor. 

00:00:30
J. BARRY MASCARI I'm Barry Mascari and I'm associate professor and chair of the Counselor Education Department at Kean University in New Jersey and an NJDRCC as well. 

00:00:40
STEPHANIE DAILEY This is a simulation of mass violence. So the first thing is that if an actual emergency does occur, we will say or one of the facilitator or staff in the room will say, "This is a real emergency." It is not something we are going to say during the scripted simulation so if something does occur we will say, "This is a real emergency." 

00:01:10
JANE WEBBER For example a fire drill. 

00:01:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yes. 

00:01:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay. 

00:01:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY There you go. 

00:01:20
J. BARRY MASCARI It's far better than the other one. 

00:01:20
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yes it is. 

00:01:20
J. BARRY MASCARI If you have a real history of trauma and believe that they'll be challenging for you to witness a live demonstration of mass shooting where fatality has occur and love ones are lost, please consider whether or not this demonstration is for you. We humbly ask that you leave now for those of you who may need to leave, please feel free to contact us and discuss learning points in the demo or to obtain resources for further information about that shooting. Ah, this is a fictitious scenario but it does, ah, contain elements from real events that we made it up. The methods are ours so don't with the scenario. Take it on face value. Meaning don't say, "Well, I would have done it differently, " while you're doing that. Questioning the decision that we have made in constructing the demonstration does nothing but compromise your ability to focus on the learning objective. 

00:02:15
JANE WEBBER Just like an IRB proposal, we have an informed consent for you to understand some of the disclosures that maybe necessary. This is a role play and it could at least have physical or emotional responses whether you have been a survivor or not. Observers will be asked to check on you as we said periodically throughout the exercises for signs of physical or emotional stress. This may include making eye contact with you regardless of whether or not you are listening in emotional response. The floaters might ask you a question or even check in with you or an entire section just to see how everyone is doing kind of like a thumbs up or thumbs down. Emotions such as fear inside and killing shame or being overwhelmed should not be ignored. Other signs of stress might include crying which I cried at everything so you might see me do that. During that, becoming agitative with us or the actors, or the floaters, or those around you. 

00:03:10
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay. Do not ignore feeling numb or checking out like you're cut off from what's happening in here and now. Pay attention to physiological signs of stress such is tightness in your chest, sweating, having trouble breathing or sitting still, and wringing or other signs that indicate nervousness. Checking with yourself throughout the exercise, if you sense signs of stress, you can a few deep breaths like blowing up a balloon and exhale. You can also leave at any time, I'm checking with the floater, it would be happy to step outside with you. Again, these signs should not be ignored whereas in other demo series, we say you cannot leave the room or reenter. In this one, feel free to leave the room if necessary. You'll be allowed to come back in. Finally, feel free to contact at any of us following the demo to experience signs of stress outside of what you normally may experience as a result of having a part of this demonstration. 

00:04:05
STEPHANIE DAILEY So thank you everyone and we will begin the demonstration. 

00:04:15

00:07:45
REBECCA PENDER I, I can't find my brother. Uhm, I made him get up and come to work this morning and he didn't want. He said that he didn't wanna go in and I made him get up and, and I dropped him at the university or the student services building and then I, I went to library. It's my fault. It's my fault he was in the building and I, I don't where he is that he, he won't answer his phone. I keep trying to call him and he won't pick and he wouldn't send any text message either. 

00:08:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY Okay, so Rebecca, what, what I'm hearing you say is that your brother was working in the student services and that you had dropped him off. 

00:08:20
REBECCA PENDER Right. 

00:08:20
STEPHANIE DAILEY Ah, you were close, close by, okay. Now, I wana let you know right now that you are in a safe place. Okay, this, this is the family assistance center and it sounds like you're trying to find out information about your brother and where he might be.

He's providing family and friends that are all gathered here with his much information as we have available right now. Now, I can't, I can't promise or, or say that he has any information about your brother but again, you're, you're safe right here and this is the right place to try to find out information -

STEPHANIE DAILEY I saw, I saw you walking over here and you were walking with a limb. Is this, is this a recent injury? Is this something that might have happened this morning? 

00:09:20
REBECCA PENDER I think so. I, I was running-- I was all the way to the library before class and then I heard the shots so I ran back towards to the services building to see if I could find my brother and I, I think I fell and then I got up and I just keep running cuz I just-- I really wanted to find my bother. 

00:09:35
STEPHANIE DAILEY Okay, okay. So are you in any pain right now? 

00:09:40

REBECCA PENDER Well, I can't call my parents. 

00:11:45
STEPHANIE DAILEY Okay. 

00:11:45
REBECCA PENDER There is no way because, ah, it's my fault. It's my fault that my brother went in cuz he don't wanna go in. 

00:11:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY Okay. 

00:11:55
REBECCA PENDER And he said he don't wanna go in and I said, "No, you have to because you have to go to work." 

00:11:55
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah, and so-- and, and you took him onto... 

00:12:00
REBECCA PENDER Yeah, cuz I, I-- yeah, I don't think I can call them yet. I don't think I can. 

00:12:00
STEPHANIE DAILEY Okay, well, well-- I, I mean I, I understand the way that you're feeling and right now, there's, there's no need to, to put any blame anywhere.

00:15:05
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uhm, and I, I've received all this information from our communication's officer. Uhm, there's one active shooter that we know that has been taken into police custody. I do know that the entire campus is on lockdown, uhm, that individuals are not able to come in or out, uhm, that family and friends are all going to be meeting here and again this is where, uhm, the communications officer will be bringing in this much information as we have in and unfortunately, that's all that I really know as of right now. 

00:15:35
REBECCA PENDER But you said this is safe. 

00:15:35
STEPHANIE DAILEY Absolutely, this, this is a safe place for us to be. I know you've been through a lot in these last couple of hours. The resource is here. If you're foot starts hurting or if there's something else. If you begin to get, uhm, headache which would, you know might happen. You might begin to feel just a little bit, uhm, faint, little weak -

JANE WEBBER Sheena, do you feel any distress in any part of your body right now? 

00:19:30
SHEENA It's my head, it's pounding. My head is pounding. I can't even see straight. I'm just-- do you know where my roommate is? Have you seen her? Her name is Cathy.

00:28:50
SHEENA It's awful. Uhm, I, ah, can't sleep at all and, uhm, my roommate. 

00:29:00
JANE WEBBER Your roommate Cathy. 

00:29:05
SHEENA She died, she died in the shooting. 

00:29:15
JANE WEBBER We are so sorry, we're so sorry for your lost. 

00:29:20
SHEENA I, I can't sleep at all. They move my dorm room but... 

00:29:25
JANE WEBBER So you're in a different dorm, in a different room but you're not sleeping. 

00:29:30
SHEENA I can't go to class either that's why I came here today because I can't do anything. I'm just... 

00:29:35
JANE WEBBER But you came here so that's an important step. 

00:29:40
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:29:40
JANE WEBBER I'm glad but you look very, very distress. It's okay. 

00:29:45
J. BARRY MASCARI The last time you were calling your parents have-- you've been on regular contact with them? 

00:29:50
SHEENA Yeah, I just can't afford to go out. They had--- they live across the country, so they... 

00:29:55
JANE WEBBER So you came back. 

00:29:55
SHEENA They came here though for the funeral. 

00:30:00
JANE WEBBER Yeah, and you went to the funeral? 

00:30:05
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:30:10
JANE WEBBER It looks like it was very tough. 

00:30:15
J. BARRY MASCARI And what about friends now? 

00:30:20
SHEENA We're all at the funeral. I just-- I don't-- she was my best friend. I mean we did everything together and I just wish it were me sometimes instead of her because why did I send her to get my lunch that day? I mean. 

00:30:40
JANE WEBBER So you're feeling very responsible for that. 

00:30:40
SHEENA Yes. 

00:30:40
JANE WEBBER There's nothing you could have done differently. Sheena, it's not your fault. 

00:30:45
J. BARRY MASCARI It's a natural feeling after any kind of disastrous event to feel that way. 

00:30:55
JANE WEBBER Do you have any spiritual support? 

00:31:00
SHEENA Yeah, ah, my pastor. My pastor, ah, was at the funeral too and yeah, I go to church. 

00:31:10
JANE WEBBER So he is there for you and your church is there for you. 

00:31:15
SHEENA Yeah. But I just-- I can't, I can't live this way. I, I just can't live this way. I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating, I'm... 

00:31:25
JANE WEBBER And you feel so responsible. Sheena, I have to asked you a question, right. Can you help me? 

00:31:35
SHEENA Uh-hmm. 

00:31:35
JANE WEBBER Ah, with the funeral and the death of Cathy and everything, and how you can't cope right now. Have you been thinking of killing yourself? 

00:31:45
SHEENA No. I will never kill myself. I just-- I just wish it were me sometimes but I will never kill myself - 

00:31:55
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:31:55
SHEENA - and I didn't talk to my parents and my pastor about that and... 

00:31:55
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. You talk to them about suicide? 

00:32:00
SHEENA Yeah, they saw me that, you know, there's so much so live for and I can get through this so I'm not gonna kill myself. I just-- I feel like I'm going crazy. I, I stay up all night. 

00:32:15
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:32:15
SHEENA And I can't stay in my room alone. I'm not in the same dorm room but I can't be in there. 

00:32:20
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:32:20
SHEENA I don't have a roommate or anything. 

00:32:25
JANE WEBBER And you're not sleeping. These are very normal reactions to all the, the terrifying things that you been through and also with Cathy's death. These are normal and we'd like to work with you if you'd like to come back again and work with you so that you can make it, make it through this tough period but if you do have thoughts again on, on suicide, uhm, come right over here. We're here 24/7. If we're not, someone will be on duty and just let them know that you've seen us before or you can call 911 and, and I think I have a card over there and Barry, you could give Sheena. There's a hotline as well so if you do need to talk to someone and it's in the middle of the night, this is a great card to call but let's try do do something right now to, to help you feel that. Remember last time you're here, we asked you where you felt you're distress in your body. Now, can you feel distress in a certain places? 

00:33:15
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:33:15
JANE WEBBER Can you show us? In your chest, chest. Is it tight, is it sharp? 

00:33:20
SHEENA It's tight. 

00:33:25
JANE WEBBER Tight. 

00:33:25
SHEENA It's hard to breathe. 

00:33:25
JANE WEBBER Hard to breathe so we're gonna work on some breathing again. 

00:33:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Remember, we did some breathing? 

00:33:25
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:33:30
J. BARRY MASCARI Probably, you don't have chance to practice it. 

00:33:30
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm, so I am very glad that you came back today. 

00:33:35
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. So, you know, kinda get comfortable and we'll do a little different breathing. So we're gonna do, uhm, first of, wanna talk about a sad, it's a way of measuring how the stressed you are and then zero to 10, 10 being the worst they could possibly. What's your sad about now? 

00:34:00
JANE WEBBER It can be harder than 10, too. 

00:34:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah, 10 points. 

00:34:00
SHEENA Well, when I first saw you guys it was 20. 

00:34:05
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:34:05
JANE WEBBER At 20. 

00:34:05
SHEENA It's so awful. 

00:34:10
JANE WEBBER Awful. 

00:34:10
SHEENA Now, I'm at like 10, I guess. 

00:34:10
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay. 

00:34:10
JANE WEBBER Still very distressed. 

00:34:15
J. BARRY MASCARI So let's see if we can bring it down a little bit and help you to feel more calm because you have a lot going on and if you think back, this is like when you first started college all over again. You're in a new dorm, in a new setting so you said it feels likes you're going crazy, you're not. There's just a lot happening. 

00:34:30
SHEENA So I will not grieve? 

00:34:30
JANE WEBBER It's a normal reaction to terrible, terrible things and, and you're still grieving your friend and that's very important to be able to grieve for Cathy. So let's try this. 

00:34:45
J. BARRY MASCARI So we'll, we'll take a deep breath in. We're gonna do rational and try some thigh tapping which kinda helps you to react. Remember when we met, you are tapping you feet. 

00:34:55
JANE WEBBER Yes, I remember that. 

00:34:55
J. BARRY MASCARI It's kind of natural reaction and we just kinda may be over exaggerated a little and then, if this something you like, you can practice it in between time whenever you feel yourself distress. 

00:35:05
SHEENA Okay. 

00:35:05
J. BARRY MASCARI So you take a deep breath in, then slowly, not like, like a balloon but... 

00:35:20
JANE WEBBER Very, very good. 

00:35:25
J. BARRY MASCARI And then you're gonna look up and smile. 

00:35:25
JANE WEBBER I know it hard. Try to smile. Can't smile and be anxious at the same time. It helps a little bit, okay. 

00:35:35
J. BARRY MASCARI So we'll... 

00:35:35
JANE WEBBER Follow Barry. 

00:35:40
J. BARRY MASCARI A little tapping and you can close your eyes if you need to. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:36:10
J. BARRY MASCARI Take a deep breath in. 

00:36:15
JANE WEBBER Good, good. 

00:36:20
J. BARRY MASCARI Smile. Try it again. 

00:36:20
JANE WEBBER Okay, do it again. Ready? 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:50
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay, deep breath in. 

00:36:55
JANE WEBBER Good, good. Bring that breath a little way out down to your belly. 

00:37:05
J. BARRY MASCARI And look at me. 

00:37:10
JANE WEBBER Thank you. 

00:37:10
J. BARRY MASCARI A little one more? 

00:37:10
JANE WEBBER One more round. Ready? 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:35
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay, take a deep breath in. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
J. BARRY MASCARI And-- so think about that one to 10 scale. How are you feeling now? 

00:37:55
SHEENA Much better. 

00:37:55
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:37:55
JANE WEBBER Can you give it a number? 

00:38:00
SHEENA It was seven. 

00:38:00
JANE WEBBER Seven. 

00:38:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay. 

00:38:00
JANE WEBBER It is down. 

00:38:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

00:38:00
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:38:00
J. BARRY MASCARI So what we'd like you do is to practice this whenever you feel you're distress. You can find a calm place and be able to do it and also, you work on not thinking why you're doing it. Empty your mind. 

00:38:15
SHEENA Okay. 

00:38:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Do you meditate? 

00:38:20
SHEENA Uhm, not a lot. 

00:38:20
JANE WEBBER It's not a lot. 

00:38:20
J. BARRY MASCARI Okay. 

00:38:20
SHEENA A long a time ago. 

00:38:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Can you remember the idea of emptying your mind? 

00:38:25
SHEENA I remember something like that? 

00:38:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm, so you just focus on your breathing. 

00:38:30
SHEENA Okay. 

00:38:30
JANE WEBBER Now, you said all those things come back into your mind, in your head. I guess they're real headache. Is there a place somewhere, anywhere, the beach, the mountains, your home, your bedroom, somewhere that you feel really calm and secure, and safe? Do you have one of those places? 

00:38:50
SHEENA Yeah, ah... 

00:38:50
JANE WEBBER Tell us. 

00:38:50
SHEENA My room that I grow up in back home. 

00:38:55
JANE WEBBER Can you describe it to me? 

00:39:00
SHEENA It's a powder blue color, the walls. 

00:39:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:39:00
JANE WEBBER Blue. 

00:39:00
SHEENA Uhm, and it's yellow - 

00:39:05
JANE WEBBER And yellow. 

00:39:05
SHEENA - pillows and comforter. Just blue and yellow. It's where I feel... 

00:39:10
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm, and you feel good there. You feel safe? 

00:39:15
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:39:15
JANE WEBBER So if you get a lot of distressing thoughts particularly the pictures, those images that drive to be distress, I want you to try to picture your room. Can you picture your room in color in your mind? Close your eyes. Picture your room, picture your bed, the color of the walls, can you see yourself on your bed? 

00:39:35
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:39:35
JANE WEBBER Yeah. How's if feeling when you see yourself? 

00:39:40
SHEENA I just feel safe and warm there. 

00:39:40
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. Good. That's your safe place and I know you can picture it so whenever you need to picture your safe place, I want you to bring up the picture of room. Let's try it again. Close your eyes, I want you to go to your room. I want you to see the pale blue walls and yellow and the bed and I see you smiling a little bit. 

00:40:00
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:40:05
JANE WEBBER And how do you feel when you picture that room again? 

00:40:05
SHEENA It is very calming - 

00:40:05
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:40:10
SHEENA - and safe there. 

00:40:10
JANE WEBBER Good. So that's something you can do in between sessions. 

00:40:15
J. BARRY MASCARI And, and these are a favorite color. It helps to feel relax. 

00:40:20
SHEENA The blue. It is the powder blue of the room. 

00:40:20
JANE WEBBER The blue, powder blue. 

00:40:20
J. BARRY MASCARI So when you practice the breathing and the thigh tapping, close your eyes and picture that color. 

00:40:30
JANE WEBBER Okay. What else? What else would you want to talk about today? 

00:40:35
SHEENA Uhm, I just-- I don't what to do about my classes. 

00:40:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:40:40
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
SHEENA Every time I start to walk to class, I think about how - 

00:40:45
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:40:45
SHEENA - me and my roommate - 

00:40:50
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:40:50
JANE WEBBER And? 

00:40:50
SHEENA - had all of our classes together. 

00:40:50
JANE WEBBER Together. 

00:40:50
SHEENA We sat next to each other. 

00:40:55
JANE WEBBER Yeah, and you tried, the classes started again Monday. That's four weeks from the shooting and have you been to class? Have you been able to get in the room? None, okay. And, uhm, what, what do you feel as you try to go to class? 

00:41:10
SHEENA Just complete panic. 

00:41:10
JANE WEBBER Panic. 

00:41:15
SHEENA Just tighten ups - 

00:41:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:41:15
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:41:15
SHEENA - and I just freeze and I can't move. I can get about half way there and I just can't go further. 

00:41:20
J. BARRY MASCARI We probably can't do anything today about that but there's some things we can do to try and help you approach getting back to class. Uhm, but so we need to have a broader plan for you about what you see yourself doing for the rest of the semester. You give any thought to that? 

00:41:40
SHEENA I've been talking to my parents about going home but I don't know that will affect my classes in my semester but I don't know if I can handle this. 

00:41:50
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. We do have students, some of the graduate students are escorting students to those special classes where someone died and they've been able to sit with you but it doesn't sound like you've been able to get to the class and we can't tell you that there is a plan where we could help you work with the dean to perhaps finish your classes on your own. Uhm, but we've had to meet with them when you feel really comfortable in doing that. Would that be something that might work for you? And then, you could go home for the last three or four weeks of this semester. 

00:42:20
SHEENA I think I would be something that would be better being going to class. 

00:42:25
JANE WEBBER And I heard that your parents are a good support. 

00:42:30
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:42:30
JANE WEBBER And your pastor is a good support. 

00:42:30
SHEENA Yeah. 

00:42:30
JANE WEBBER And that your room is a safe place for you. 

00:42:35
J. BARRY MASCARI So we can probably talk to the dean and start finding more details and then get back to you on what we can do. 

00:42:40
SHEENA Okay. Thank you. 

00:42:45
JANE WEBBER Anything else for today? First, again, I want to tell you how, how proud I am that you came over and that you remembered us and I'm glad that I was on duty this morning. It was good to see you and I'm glad that we're working with you. 

00:42:55
SHEENA Thank you. 

00:42:55
JANE WEBBER And that you're willing to come back in a couple of days. 

00:43:00
SHEENA I would, I would like that very much. 

00:43:00
JANE WEBBER And you have your card that you know can call 24/7 on the hotline. 

00:43:05
SHEENA All right. 

00:43:05
JANE WEBBER And I am a little concern that you, you're in a new dorm with new people and no roommate and that maybe hard so that's something we would wanna talk about. So let's see what else was on your mind and as you decided to come over to see us today. 

00:43:20
SHEENA Ah, just not knowing how to cope with all the feelings and not knowing if I was crazy or not but, ah... 

00:43:30
J. BARRY MASCARI Well... 

00:43:30
JANE WEBBER And you know you're not crazy - 

00:43:30
SHEENA Right. 

00:43:30
JANE WEBBER - but this is a normal reaction and, and I can see that you're eyes are telling me that it's hard. You've been through terrible stuff. 

00:43:40
J. BARRY MASCARI True. 

00:43:40
JANE WEBBER And you have pictures in your mind that you want to work on but we can't do all of that in one day. 

00:43:45
J. BARRY MASCARI There's been a lot going on and you can see us as much as you need to. One of us will be here. You can just call on and fit in to the schedule and there's some techniques, I don't know how much longer you're gonna be here but we can teach you some other kinds of things to kinda help you erase some of these images. And the images are your brain's wave trying to make sense out of this so it' s going to take time but it will eventually sort itself out and we can help that. 

00:44:15
SHEENA I feel better after the breathing and the tappinng so - 

00:44:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Good. 

00:44:15
SHEENA - I'll try that home. 

00:44:20
JANE WEBBER And your body is reacting to all your stress. Distress stays in your body and in your mind and that's normal but now we can work with you to help you, ah, regain control over your body and reduce some of the images. 

00:44:30
SHEENA All right. 

00:44:30
JANE WEBBER But you know you can call at any time and if we're not here, you can talk to the person on duty. 

00:44:40
SHEENA Great. 

00:44:40
JANE WEBBER Right and your support between now and the next two day, who would be your support in those two days? 

00:44:45
SHEENA Well, uhm, I always have my parents to call. I have friends here but they're so distraught too. I mean nobody that goes here can help because everybody is going to their own thing. 

00:45:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Yes. 

00:45:00
SHEENA Uhm, but I have a little co-pastor and I have, ah, an aunt who lives close to the university. 

00:45:10
JANE WEBBER Good. 

00:45:10
SHEENA And she's a very, you know - 

00:45:10
JANE WEBBER A good support. 

00:45:10
SHEENA - a really good support. 

00:45:15
JANE WEBBER So you have a circle of support. We have a drop in group about three times a day for students. We can give you the schedule outside and that means you can come in and sit. You can talk or you can just listen but there will other people that are concerned, ah, about the shooting and, and recovering, and about loss. So you are welcome to join them as well. 

00:45:35
SHEENA Thank you. 

00:45:35
JANE WEBBER At one o'clock we can make an appointment. 

00:45:35
SHEENA Yes, please. 

00:45:40
JANE WEBBER I wanna thank you for coming. 

00:45:40
SHEENA Thank you. 

00:45:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Our favorite drink of the day. 

00:45:40
SHEENA Thank you. 

00:45:45
JANE WEBBER Good. 

00:45:45
J. BARRY MASCARI Just stay hydrated. 

00:45:45
JANE WEBBER Okay, so we'll make a new appointment and I give you the schedule. And I'm very proud that you came today. 

00:45:50
SHEENA Thank you. 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:46:00
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uhm, thank you everyone for being with us during the simulation. Uhm, can you hear me now? Uhm, what, what we're gonna send the next 25 minutes doing is discussing the simulation, discussing what we did. They were-- as you, as you can see there was almost three different scenes or, you know, uhm, scenarios that, that we portrayed. 

00:46:30
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:46:30
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uhm, the first scenario was, you know, psychological first aid and just providing information, providing comfort and support. I hope everybody was able to, to get a handout and, ah, if, if you weren't, you can come up to us afterwards and get Barry a business card. But in-- on that handout, it is-- it's gives a brief description of what psychological first aid and the eight core areas of psychological first aid and that was a lot of what you saw. Just the basic, basic skills. 

00:47:05
JANE WEBBER And as mental health counselors, we typically think we're dumbing ourselves down by giving out water or providing information or a psycho education and yet, that's what people need in the immediate aftermath. They don't need psychotherapy because we don't do that at that time. This is neighbor helping neighbor and it's very important that we stay at that level unless we see major triggers. 

00:47:30
J. BARRY MASCARI The, uhm, you probably seen like we had an over emphasis on drinking water but, ah, the things people forget to do right when they're upset, hydrate and breath. I mean sounds ridiculous that people forget to breath and, and I just wanted to share this because it's taking me a few seconds to come out of, ah, our, our role. 

00:47:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

00:47:50
JANE WEBBER Yeah, 

00:47:55
J. BARRY MASCARI Ah, there's definitely. If they portray after that event, I'm still thinking like wow and I don't know if you saw Sheena but she could became the academy award because, ah, you had, ah, tears coming down. That were real tears and so I mean it really help to go for us. 

00:48:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY I have-- yeah, and I've stay when Barry was always doing that, the sad score and the breathing. Uhm, started doing the breathing. Uhm, I mean that this simulation, the video cameras, the-- you guys but, but also this simulation and just thinking, am I doing the right thing for Rebecca? Am I giving her what she needs? I'm feeling stress, I'm feeling, uhm, like I'm not sure if, if, if I'm able like there's nothing I can do for her. As a counselor... 

00:48:40
 Tremendous feeling of frustration. 

00:48:45
STEPHANIE DAILEY As a coun-- when she talks about grief with her or-- not they got grief, the guilt with her brother. I-- I'm a mental health counselor. I wanna go there but, but I, I do not go there. I just no one is to blame, information. 

00:49:00
JANE WEBBER And it's very easy to say, "I'm sure your brother is fine," or, "I'm sure your friend is fine," - 

00:49:05
STEPHANIE DAILEY No promises. 

00:49:05
JANE WEBBER - which are totally wrong things to say and you have-- sometimes we feel a little stoic but it's incredibly important to say, "We only have this information, we'll have some more information later," because it can really, really upset a person because they're already in shock. Ah, but PFA seems so boring but I, I'll have to tell you after many disasters, it works for about 80% of the people - 

00:49:25
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uh-hmm. 

00:49:25
JANE WEBBER - and it really does work. 

00:49:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

00:49:30
JANE WEBBER You just have to sit through it and realize it works. 

00:49:30
J. BARRY MASCARI The last thing you wanna say is everything will be all right cuz you don't know that. 

00:49:35
STEPHANIE DAILEY Cuz it's, it's not 

00:49:35
JANE WEBBER No, your life is a change. 

00:49:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Six, six months from now, things will sort itself out. 

00:49:40
JANE WEBBER We jump started, ah, we had two sessions of PFA and then we jump started and we move forward four weeks which is kind of the timeline for whether or not you have PTST instead of acute stress disorder. Uhm., basically, the university shut down. It was in a crisis mode. It didn't have classes and a huge trigger is to start classes again after an absence. 

00:50:05
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:50:05
JANE WEBBER Who comes back? Who doesn't come back? Have you found out where they've gone. Uhm, you come back and hope thing will be just the way they were before you left and you have huge incidences of, of distressed and panic-- strict on students and we have a lot of attempted suicides at that time because it hits home when they come. You know, the people aren't there and so you do assess if the slightest idea that there is this. Now, you need to asses it quickly - 

00:50:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:50:25
JANE WEBBER - and see if they have a support system because they maybe coming because they're suicidal but they can't say that. 

00:50:30
J. BARRY MASCARI And we were kinda thinking ahead if Sheena is coming back for other sessions. Maybe some brain spotting, maybe helping her to, to let herself heal on her own. Something that you're not fam-- and if you're not familiar of brain spotting, right so if your not just go on the web. Look at David Grand's Brainspotting. Take a look at it. 

00:50:50
JANE WEBBER It's a modified aim to you. 

00:50:55
J. BARRY MASCARI The new neurobiology research suggest that the brain if its conditions are set right and people can stay calm, not retraumatize himself while telling this whole story, you know, as we try to avoid that, is the brain starts to heal itself, start to make sense out of things that don't really make sense. 

00:51:10
JANE WEBBER There is no sense in someone dying, or your roommate dying, or dropping off your brother and then, he's gone. There is no sense in that so we don't try to make sense. If they have made spiritual sense out of it some meaning, uhm, I'll rung the grief process and the other is four weeks is way too short for grieving, uhm, someone close to you. It may take a year or, two years, or six year and we can't minimize that but if you notice, we didn't ask for the trauma story. Ah, Sheena, you, you talk about running out the building - 

00:51:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:51:40
JANE WEBBER - but we didn't go into that. You don't wanna add anymore of that to that point because it just exacerbates the, the terror in your mind. 

00:51:45
J. BARRY MASCARI And then I saw it blips up and now we have to deal with comment, yeah. 

00:51:50
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

00:51:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY I do wanna add, there's a, there's fine balance between trying to identify risk factors - 

00:51:55
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:51:55
STEPHANIE DAILEY - uhm, as, ah, in the immediate, uhm, PFA phase and you know when you're in the family assistant center. So I was listening for Rebecca's experience - 

00:52:05
 Yes. 

00:52:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY - and the red flags, internal red flags that I, I had in my mind was she heard gun shots. 

00:52:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:52:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY This is somebody that we need to keep our eye on, we, disaster counselors. She ran and she was hurt so certainly, the phy-- they physical, the, the physical injury, a big deal but as a disaster mental health counselor, what's also a big deal that she got to the point emotionally. So arouse emotionally, she felt like she need to run, she might have fell and, and I don't go into this but I'm, it's a risk factor that she felt that she was in danger. 

00:52:45
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:52:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY So that-- those are two key risk factors. It doesn't have anybody in the area. It seem like didn't have a lot of, of social supports so I've tried to connect to her with, you know. So I'm, I'm not try-- I'm really trying not to re-- retraumatize but there is an information that I need to gather. 

00:53:05
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah, the three big is see, hear, and smell. 

00:53:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uh-hmm. 

00:53:10
J. BARRY MASCARI Smell is the strongest. 

00:53:15
JANE WEBBER Ah, the smell of, uhm, bombs, the smell of weapons, the smell of blood, uhm, stay with you and imprints in your body, very strong. 

00:53:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Or wherever it is. Ah, the smell of french fries in the student center. 

00:53:30
JANE WEBBER Yeah. You may never eat a french fries forever. 

00:53:30
J. BARRY MASCARI So that's all of the triggers. 

00:53:30
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah, and with the sounds, uhm, the announcements that we played before the, the montage of the news reports kind of flashing. That will list it's an emotional response even for individuals that have not been involve whatsoever. So imagine if you are a survivor and have a loved one and you, you are gonna continue they'll be hearing that. Now, we really were unable to, you know shut down media but in the family assistant center, we wouldn't have a TV. I would be screening people for their-- being on their phones or any type of electronic devices and really trying to limit exposure to that. 

00:54:15
JANE WEBBER Now, you saw one on one in a family assistance center, imagine two or three-- 400 people streaming in, looking for help, all at once so it's usually noisy, chaotic, crazy, and you're looking for wall or a corner to talk with someone. So there's a large amount of noise, uhm, and we tend not to do that we tell what you see, what you touch or feel, I try not do hearing if it's a real chaotic place because it just, it just magnifies all the chaos that they're already hearing. 

00:54:45
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

00:54:45
JANE WEBBER And so I tend to leave that one out and we found in situations to be much safer for them. And that's grounding because Sheena was starting to lose her own sense of reality like why am I here? You know, and looking a scans like how did I get here and I know Jim brought her here but there are points when you're just there in shock and you don't so we try to reground by just saying, "Let's take a look at where we are," and doing that in a very gentle way. 

00:55:05
J. BARRY MASCARI So you have a natural dissociation that occurs, right, after something happens and as soon as where you can bring the person back to where we are, the better. Of course, it's gonna be upsetting because then they start to think about all the horrific things that have happened. Also, uhm, we tend to work in teams that's a kind of preferred - 

00:55:25
JANE WEBBER Yes, yes. 

00:55:25
J. BARRY MASCARI - ideas. So somebody can always keep an eye out for something else. You don't necessarily have to both sit with the person but teams is a preffered modality. 

00:55:35
STEPHANIE DAILEY Tara was there. Tara, my disaster counselor, was very aware of, of where I was and what I was doing and also to Jane's point, uhm, normally, I would try to ask Rebecca if she would move to the side with me. Try as the best I could to provide some sort of confidential space but not the confidential space we're talking about in, in a ty-- typical mental health setting. 

00:56:00
JANE WEBBER Right, and typically, uhm, at least with our, our disaster response is licensed in New Jersey, uhm, we have four to six pairs for every team supervisors. So we're always looking for a team leader around if we have a crisis. So we call, you know, if you look at site start with the Red Cross. If you got a purple or a red crisis, ah, someone who died, someone who, who has seen something. I'm always looking for my supervisor for referral. We're not gonna do crisis-- serious crisis right there. We're going to bring them to another place or another private area so the team has really help. We, we simulated that a month later at the counseling center because we also work at the counseling center and I'm looking and have you said schedule for the day and I'm chatting with Barry but Sheena ask for us because she remembered us and that was a contact. Ah, if are those one of us, fine but if she want to see both, it does create the same sense of safety that she was-- it was created before and two are always better than one if you have enough people to go around. 

00:57:00
J. BARRY MASCARI Speaking of safety, safety is primary for you, right? 

00:57:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
J. BARRY MASCARI You don't know a lot of these folks, you don't know how they're reacting, uhm, and depending on who might drift in. A lot of folks who take advantage of people on crisis so you're always, if necessary, sacrifice confidentiality or as you would suggested, you know, a secure place for safety. Safety should never be sacrifice. 

00:57:30
 Accidentally, we get this as a question. 

00:57:30
JANE WEBBER Yes. 

00:57:30
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

00:57:35
 I just have, uhm, one question from that. Uhm, in the situation that I've been, sometimes people wanna tell their stories. 

00:57:40
JANE WEBBER Yes. 

00:57:40
 I'm not cutting off to tell their story. 

00:57:45
JANE WEBBER That's correct. 

00:57:45
J. BARRY MASCARI Right. 

00:57:45
 It's so important to them to been able to be heard. 

00:57:45
JANE WEBBER But it is the individual's choice and we provide-- the question was, uhm, I'm lost data. Do you wanna say it again. 

00:57:55
STEPHANIE DAILEY Telling their situation. 

00:57:55
J. BARRY MASCARI People want to tell their story 

00:57:55
JANE WEBBER Let them tell their story and you are there for support and sometimes, it comes out completely. That's a good thing for them and you provide support but we don't go and ask for the story to come out. It does, clients will say it when they need and I've had them on the first day of a, of disaster and sometimes never but yes. It's not that we're detouring them but it is their call. 

00:58:20
J. BARRY MASCARI And you talking about it initially, right? When they come in they wanna spill their guts. 

00:58:20
 Sometimes they do. 

00:58:20
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

00:58:25
JANE WEBBER And that, that provides safety for some people. 

00:58:25
J. BARRY MASCARI And sometimes that's enough and it's done, and they don't need to come back at the counseling center. It's their-- the whole issue of, you know, ah, resiliency and post traumatic growth is amazing. I mean people are amazingly resilient. 

00:58:40
 Sometimes. 

00:58:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Yes. 

00:58:40
JANE WEBBER I have heard an entire graphic stories blow by blow of a school shooting, uhm, high school and they get it all out. Uhm, they some water, they sit quietly, they drew some, they go home, and they're fine. 

00:58:50
J. BARRY MASCARI Right. 

00:58:55
JANE WEBBER Other people can't say anything and they're not fine for years so it's so individual and you need to be attuned and listen to where they're going with it and it is hard but definitely watch for other signs. 

00:59:05
J. BARRY MASCARI And then somebody like four weeks later who's showing those signs, chances are they've had prior trauma. Right, we know that. 

00:59:10
STEPHANIE DAILEY Probably, 80% chance. 

00:59:15
J. BARRY MASCARI How's that? 

00:59:15
 Uhm, you mention the brain spotting ah, a little bit in, in EMDR is that the main technique? 

00:59:25
J. BARRY MASCARI There is no, I mean... 

00:59:25
JANE WEBBER There is main technique. 

00:59:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

00:59:25
STEPHANIE DAILEY You-- he said, uhm, you mention EMDR and brain spotting, is there another technique? 

00:59:30
J. BARRY MASCARI There are so many of-- kind of techniques out there. I mean they really hasn't been. You know, if you go on some of website those that you're interested, there's a list of evidence based kinds of interventions. I mean we're in the infancy of this stuff, really. When you think about it I mean for the last, the 100 years we've been traumatizing and retraumatizing people by encouraging to tell their story. We, we talk about yesterday in our session, how many people leave a session feeling worst than when they went in. You're great. You know, I'm gonna let your client go on and get in the car and they're feeling worst. You know, the idea is to try and only approach to the level that they can come feeling good. Nobody really wants to go to see somebody can feel worst than you went in the door. Brainspotting and EMDR techniques we, we are familiar with them. 

01:00:20
JANE WEBBER People use cognitive processing therapy or trauma focus - 

01:00:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Right. 

01:00:25
JANE WEBBER - the CBT or emotionally focus trauma therapy. I could probably go through 14 that I've tried and I find-- I use whatever works when I really get to know that client ant that's what's important. 

01:00:35
J. BARRY MASCARI I mention that to Sheena about trying them to your mind because I watching her when she was doing this tapping thinking there's a possibility that your visualizing those images. 

01:00:45
JANE WEBBER Yes, and so it is... 

01:00:50
J. BARRY MASCARI And so of course, self talk. 

01:00:50
 Another question. 

01:00:55
JANE WEBBER Yes. 

01:00:55
 I couldn't really see from over here but when you were guiding her with the, when you where guiding her with the breathing exercise and asking her to, ah, look at the box, what was the box part? 

01:01:05
J. BARRY MASCARI Box, box breathing is just a way to get people to, to picture going up and breathing, holding for three, and exhaling for three. 

01:01:15
JANE WEBBER It adds the visual and it definitely focus. 

01:01:20
J. BARRY MASCARI And it's... 

01:01:20
 It gives structure. 

01:01:20
JANE WEBBER I put a box right on it. 

01:01:20
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. Right. 

01:01:20
JANE WEBBER Piece of tape, put the box on the wall, making look out of it. 

01:01:25
J. BARRY MASCARI And it stops the hyperventilation because were having trouble with that cuz she was ready to go right back in and stop breathing and they're like, okay. 

01:01:30
JANE WEBBER As many senses as you can employ in any activity or exercise is a safe to breathing but any of that as many visual auditory touching, it helps because, uhm, trauma is placed in the body and so as many sense that are used to do that and a lot people just try to breath and if you see it, it's not focus 

01:01:50
J. BARRY MASCARI And also we're trying to distract them what's the chance, she was in her in head and running all of this over and over again. So the more we can distract them from that. 

01:02:00
J. BARRY MASCARI So it's kind of a target to look at in and distract what's in your head. 

01:02:10
 Uhm, earlier you had, uhm, briefly mention about the sort of balance, the safety thing, the confidentiality. 

01:02:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

01:02:15
 So I was wondering like in a situation like this, what would it look like four-- like 4% or something, if maybe not in the right term of mine, you can, can give that form of sentence. 

01:02:30
STEPHANIE DAILEY So what-- the question was, you know, an correct me if I'm wrong, but the question was, you know, what about confidentiality, informed consent, you mention balancing safety, HIPAA, ah, FERPA, ah, we're in a school setting, uhm, so I introduced myself as a disaster counselor. Uhm, if I get into a situation where I'm beginning to realize that, uhm, more-- someone is getting into story, uhm, and, and it often helps I just wanna-- you know, I often repeat my name, my role, you know, I am and also has been say I am a disaster mental health counselor. I wanna make sure that they know who I am. I'm not a case worker, I'm mascara, I'm not sheltering, I'm not feeding, you know, I am, uhm, I've try, there is, there is no confidentiality. I mean, of course, there-- I attempt but I do the best I can to move someone aside but as Jane said I'm in shelters, I've been in cafeterias, I've been sitting down with someone, other people sit down next to us and it would be completely inappropriate for me to be me like, oh, we'll, you know, we got this whole thing like hmp-hmp because we need to go, uhm, but if it, if it-- if there becomes a time where it is necessary for, for, for me to say and it usually has to do with deal harm to self rather then I, I will always say you know, I'm a disaster counselor. We've had a lot of resources here and, uhm, and I do think it would be really helpful for us to walk over and to talk to someone. 

01:04:05
J. BARRY MASCARI I think also what happens is because everyone experiences event, this is sort of not real big confidentiality about that. 

01:04:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

01:04:15
J. BARRY MASCARI It's kinda like in a group. They're all willing to share and hear this. 

01:04:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

01:04:15
JANE WEBBER We go with, ah, three words - 

01:04:20
J. BARRY MASCARI It's a good question. 

01:04:20
JANE WEBBER - protect, direct, and connect. Connect immediately with a loved one, uhm, the right person, or friend. Uhm, you are protecting them for great, uhm, additional emotional or physical harm. So we do assess when necessary for suicide but almost always it's shocked rather than that and this is four weeks later so we know she is grieving and considering herself responsible a death. Uhm, but the protect is really not to overdo it. So if when someone wants to tells us their story, I am willing to listen, uhm, but I'm not going to, uhm, exacerbate the situation. Uhm, and the direct is we have skills and whether we use PFA or we use mental health or assessment, or with triage, we do have skills but we use them next Ah, but confidentiality, you know, we try our best and the things do not harm and so I have to move someone or talk to someone seriously and I have a million people around, I have an imaginary circle around ourselves and that's about all we get. 

01:05:15
J. BARRY MASCARI You know, this kind of situation, people are upset, but other kinds of scenarios, people can get ugly. They can get angry and you saw that with the Malaysian airlines thing where, ah, people were getting pushed over and punching people. So that's why one of the things I always say is the better to leave too soon than too late. If you see they're getting ugly, you need to get out of there, uhm, because that not your room. Fortunately, most of these settings have, ah, some kind of public safety officers present. 

01:05:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah, usually if you're a family assistance center or a shelter or something like that, there is some sort of security/ police presents. Yes? 

01:05:55
 So in the scenario where it was four weeks later, uhm, I notice that the student was-- mentioned several times about lack of sleep, uhm, what, what point would you address that since it was worrying for weeks for the appropriate regressive at that time or some other time? 

01:06:15
JANE WEBBER If we had more than 18 minutes yes. We do know that she's no longer sleeping in the room that her roommate lived her-- with her and that was urgent and so we knew that happens so we-- in rather than that she brought that up. She's probably out in the lobby sitting and, and fidgeting the whole time. And that would be the next thing to do but to get her calm, we wanted to make sure she could left with some calming and safety information. An information that she can then ponder and come back. Ah, if we have more time, we had that on our list to do but we've just, we want it to be immediate. 

01:06:45
J. BARRY MASCARI And also trying to normalize some of what you're experiencing. You know, she's got a whole lot of changes. 

01:06:55
STEPHANIE DAILEY We'll take. 

01:06:55
 What about annulment that happens often great, if you get any suicidal person what your first respond into it? How would you address that? 

01:07:05
STEPHANIE DAILEY Well, again we do not work an isolation. We do not work alone. We have a supervisor that has resources depending on the scenario, 911 is always an option. If you have a scenario like this, 911 is gonna be like very, very slow. Uhm, we have that-- at that point we would pull, pull someone over, bring in the team, do assessment, and decide whether or not a hospitalization or whatever our resources, where we have being practical. Whatever our resources were at that moment. Certainly, I would not allow that person to leave and I would not allow that person to be alone. 

01:07:45
J. BARRY MASCARI And, and since 9/11, we've all learned that you need to keep records. 

01:07:50
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

01:07:50
J. BARRY MASCARI Like, wow, who is that person that was suicidal that just walk out the door. 

01:07:55
STEPHANIE DAILEY I don't know. I this she was in red shirt. Yeah. 

01:07:55
J. BARRY MASCARI Right, so we've gotten better with that. 

01:08:00
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:00
 And I'm sorry but I do have another quick question. I'm wresting on-- that you mention, I was in New York for 9/11. I was living there and I couldn't watch a movie, see a TV show now I think for 10 years. 

01:08:10
J. BARRY MASCARI Wow. 

01:08:10
 How do you address since like that and I wasn't even close to the site. It was just family, friends, you know, the whole scene, it was immense and when I came back to the site a month later, I could still smell, you know, the-- so if you-- I didn't realize. I was even in mental health by then but I didn't realized how-- what I mean by big hush. 

01:08:30
JANE WEBBER Yes. 

01:08:35
 Would you entrance the whole, ah, college school in ways? Would you have give like 20 minutes for everyone to kinda process things even if they don't come to the office? 

01:08:45
JANE WEBBER Well, I can give you the example of Virginia attack. They did private personal and public, personal grieving, public grieving, personal traumatic processing public. They always handled it in those, both, both of those ways. Uhm, and it's stays within our body and now we have many neurological, uhm, tools to use like EMDR and brain spotting which I'll tell you really do work. And I live 22 miles from Manhattan, uhm, and it took me three years to go through a tunnel and I thought I was a pretty normal person but it just I couldn't do it. I would stepped that. I couldn't even get on a bus that going to do it. And, and I needed - 

01:09:20
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

01:09:20
JANE WEBBER - to get som help with that imprinting in my brain. Yes? 

01:09:25
STEPHANIE DAILEY I want-- can I just add one thinking back to that. We, we also-- thank you. But we also wanna make sure, I'm checking out Barry and Jane. I ask a disaster mental health worker. I'm, I'm watching them with someone who I see. I mean we, we have to be aware, you know, that's why eight to 12 hours shifts, uhm, eight if possible. I know, but, uhm, you know, I'm watching this happen. I'm seeing it, we're aware we're communicating. You know, Jane is flagging, Jim down and, and I am going to check in with my fellow workers whether they're disaster mental health personnel or not. 

01:10:05
JANE WEBBER And we might deal with 10, 12, 15, 20 people or families that day. Okay, they go back with their one story and their experience. We're going back within us of 18 or 20 stories and our reason-- ah, well, is felt. There's nothing left. 

01:10:20
J. BARRY MASCARI We does the commercial. We need to do more of public education. 

01:10:25
JANE WEBBER Yeah. 

01:10:25
J. BARRY MASCARI Even in an event like this, right, there is sometimes information providing people with simple tools. Not everybody needs to come to counseling. 

01:10:35
JANE WEBBER We have one more brief question I've just seen, please stand up there. 

01:10:40
 I don't wanna talk about how they responded - 

01:10:40
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yes. 

01:10:40
 - but I was watching. 

01:10:45
J. BARRY MASCARI Uh-hmm. 

01:10:45
 I could believe the intensity in your listening skills especially at the very beginning going through all the public, ah, that was going back there. 

01:10:55
JANE WEBBER Uh-hmm. 

01:10:55
J. BARRY MASCARI Yeah. 

01:11:00
 Ah, I mean you could a little pin drop on the rug. You was so intent in listening. Also your bodies were forwards and some of you, your faces change coerce and that they were really, really involve and when I went over to the person, to you, I had no idea she was an actor. I have no idea so I was just watching, ah, you guys respond in, I notice that. Then, when you started to do the relaxation techniques, they relaxed. 

01:11:35
STEPHANIE DAILEY Uh-hmm. 

01:11:35
 I know this point and people just - 

01:11:40
J. BARRY MASCARI Interesting. 

01:11:40
 - were doing it with you so they really got involved. 

01:11:45
STEPHANIE DAILEY If I carries relaxation. 

01:11:45
J. BARRY MASCARI She was a process observer. 

01:11:45
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yeah. 

01:11:50
JANE WEBBER And if anything you can take well-- that, that rough child, if you'd not read body remembers, a classic. Now that says you teach your clients breaks before you put the gas on and so you don't start the trauma story unless they, uhm, are ready to do it themselves without giving them emotional regulations, deep breathing, calming, a safe place to divert the mind, so breaking before gas. I, I do wanna also recognized and thank - 

01:12:15
STEPHANIE DAILEY Yes. 

01:12:15
JANE WEBBER - our graduate students. 

01:12:15
J. BARRY MASCARI Yes. 

01:12:15
JANE WEBBER Ah, Sheena, Jim, Rebecca, and that is a professor, colleague of arts and graduate schools. 

01:12:25
STEPHANIE DAILEY I will-- and also, I also like to thank our floaters, Tara and Claudia. 

01:12:35
J. BARRY MASCARI Yes. 

01:12:40
STEPHANIE DAILEY And of course, you guys for, for being here. Thank you so much. 

01:12:40
