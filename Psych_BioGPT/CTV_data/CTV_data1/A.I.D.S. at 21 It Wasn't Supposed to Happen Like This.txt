BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN We are in a health crisis. Actually, this is a health emergency in the African American community. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN I don't care who are you, how rich, how poor, how, what the color of your skin is. You are at risk and we want to have that conversation with you. 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN Man, it's, it's a dangerous game, you know? 

00:00:10
L Don't be lying when somebody tells you because there is statistics that just came out from the CDC that said that, what, one out of every eight young gay or homosexual black kids don't know they're positive. 

00:00:25
A.I.D.S. AT 21 

00:00:25
NARRATOR AIDS at 21. The specter of an epidemic. In June of 2001, the CDC released a report stating the number one killer of black men, 15 to 29, was the HIV/AIDS virus. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN It has now reached epidemic proportions, uh, in the black community as well as the Hispanic community. 

00:00:50
NARRATOR Why is this happening now when so many minority men are breaking barriers? 

00:00:55
JESSICA R. All this information we have and yet, somehow we're not using it either right or not getting it to the people who really need it. 

00:01:05
VERNON HARRIS HIV and AIDS doesn't kill you. It's the opportunistic infections that come behind having HIV and AIDs. 

00:01:10
NARRATOR And how is this affecting minority women? 

00:01:15
MARCYA OWENS I knew that, uh, if you put yourself at risk 1% of the time, you put yourself at risk 100% of the time. 

00:01:20
NARRATOR Experts and a host of fresh voices explore these questions in the search for answers. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN I don't believe that we survived the middle passage and slavery and Jim Crow and the LAPD, uh, to only die from HIV and AIDS. 

00:01:40
"It wasn't supposed to be happening like this" 

00:01:40
MARCYA OWENS HIV/AIDS Activist, ATL. 

00:01:40
MARCYA OWENS As soon as I found out that I was HIV positive, the first thing I told the doctor who, um, told me that I had HIV was that I was gonna show the world how to live with HIV. 

00:01:55
NARRATOR Marcya Owens discovered she was pregnant and HIV positive at the same time. 

00:02:00
MARCYA OWENS This was, be, when I was pregnant with Mary Ella. Um, I was diagnosed with pregnancy, HIV, and displaysia, which is a precursor to cervical cancer. I, um, I knew how I became infected. I became, from unprotected sex. 

00:02:20
JOE PRESSLEY NY A.I.D.S. Coalition, NYC 

00:02:20
JOE PRESSLEY When I started working here at the New York AIDS Coalition, um, I didn't know my HIB status. Um, you know, I was not diagnosed or did not, I didn't have an HIV test at that point and it wasn't until later during this work that I said well, I need to get tested. Um, that I felt like, you know, I need to know my own status also in terms of being able to be a better advocate. 

00:02:35
NARRATOR Joe Pressley, who is HIV positive, continues his work as an AIDS activist. 

00:02:45
JOE PRESSLEY Well I thank God for the work that I do and for, and I'm going to try to keep this as personal as possible, you know, I thank God for the work that I do and that, look, I know that becoming HIV positive or getting a diagnosis of having HIV is not a death sentence. 

00:03:00
In June 2000 282,720 African Americans Were living With HIV/AIDS In the U.S. CDC Semi-annual HIV/AIDS surveillance report June 2000 

00:03:00
NARRATOR Marcya and Joe are but two of the nearly 300,000 African Americans infected with the HIV virus. 

00:03:05
PHILL WILSON African American AIDS Policy and Training Inst., L.A. 

00:03:05
AIDS Cases in 13- to 19- Year-Olds by Race/Ethnicity, United States AIDS Cases 2001 n = 372 AIDS Cases 1981-2001 N = 4,428 U.S. Population 13-19 N-28 Million White not Hispanic Black not Hispanic Hispanic Asian/Pacific Island and American Alaska Native 

00:03:05
PHILL WILSON A recent study by the CDC showed that 95% of young black men who are HIV positive, these are young, black, gay men, who are HIV positive a, don't know that they're HIV positive and don't think that they're at risk. Those are frightening statistics, particularly when over 50% of the new HIV/AIDS cases in this country are among young people. 

00:03:30
JESSICA R. Montefiore Adolescent AIDS Program, NYC 

00:03:30
JESSICA R. People see statistics and statistics say that a lot of people are dying, less from AIDS but they're not seeing that there's more new cases on HIV, especially among youth between the ages of 13 and 21. 

00:03:40
BISHOP KENNETH ULMER Faithful Central Bible Church, L.A. 

00:03:40
BISHOP KENNETH ULMER We think it is a gay problem or we think it is the other side of town. I think that we, we don't understand how pervasive this disease is. 

00:03:50
AID ATLANTA Atlanta, GA 

00:03:50
NARRATOR While many still don't, some grassroots organizations like AID Atlanta, founded in 1982, are reaching out with an army of skilled volunteers and over 30 outreach programs. They're providing the compassionate environment needed for minority gay men and women to feel secure, improve their health, and build their self esteem. 

00:04:10
CHARLES AID Atlanta, ATL 

00:04:10
CHARLES You know, we are the generation of, of, of young folks that grew up with AIDS. Like, from, you know, from early on, it's like I just always remember it being there. So I think that it's not that, I think, we forget or we don't know, but I think that we're afraid, that a lot of us are really afraid of this and rather than feel the fear, um, we'd rather ignore it. 

00:04:30
WILLIAM PETERS Gay Men of African Descent, NYC 

00:04:30
WILLIAM PETERS I think the numbers are rising and we're seeing more people because this is a generation that has lived their entire lives with HIV as opposed to some that are, like myself, that are older, had to change behavior right in midstream if we were going to survive. 

00:04:50
PERNESSA SEELE The Balm in Gilead, NYC 

00:04:50
PERNESSA SEELE And it's like there's this big, bad monster and it's now in our community but the reality is is that it has been there all the time. 

00:04:55
SORAYA ELCOCK Harlem United, NYC 

00:04:55
SORAYA ELCOCK Before HIV/AIDS, we had the social, economic, educational issues that was devastating and ravaging a community. You add HIV on top of that and it was immense. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN I was on a plane a few weeks ago and I sat down and the guy asked me what I did for a living and I told him and his response was well, I'm really glad that we've solved the problem here, that the only time I hear about AIDS is AIDS in Africa. Well, you know, I'm still going to funerals. I get calls everyday from, from young men and young women who just found out that they're HIV positive. 

00:05:25
REV. WALLACE C. SMITH Shiloh Baptist Church, D.C. 

00:05:25
REV. WALLACE SMITH There's no question that people are coming to me more and more, uh, with, uh, the question, you know, Reverend, what do we do? You know, my nephew, my son, my grandson has come down with this and the people are, at that point, at least in their conversations with me, indicating that they, they're struggling with it more now than before. 

00:05:50
LOUIS STOKES Former Chairman CBC Health Brain Trust 

00:05:50
LOUIS STOKES When I first began, uh, yelling and screaming about the problem of AIDS and the necessity for black leadership to speak out, uh, long before I left the Congress, uh, it fell on deaf ears. 

00:06:05
RONALD JOHNSON Gay Men's Health Crisis, NYC 

00:06:05
RONALD JOHNSON The, the degree of denial of this epidemic within the black community, particularly in the early stages of the epidemic, was a very real factor. 

00:06:15
DR. AMY HARTSFELD Interdenominational Theological Center, ATL 

00:06:15
DR. AMY HARTSFELD I feel in my day to day work in dealing with young persons, uh, in this whole area of, um, sexual responsibility, HIV, AIDS, is that there's the feeling that it just won't happen to me. 

00:06:30
AURI Latin American Youth Center, DC 

00:06:30
AURI I think people are aware of the fact of HIV and AIDS but they just don't take, they just think like it's not gonna happen to them. They're like oh no, it's not gonna happen to me. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN No, I, I was just like any other kid. You know? Like, like it couldn't happen to me or, like, I didn't know anybody who had it so, like I really didn't, I really wasn't concerned about it, really. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm really scared of AIDS. It's always on my mind and it's something I think about all the time. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN When I first heard about AIDS, it didn't really affect me, uh, personally but as a worldwide event, I would say that it needs to be addressed with a certain harshness that it has yet to be, uh, established. 

00:07:15
NARRATOR In Washington, DC, SMYAL nurtures and affirms the needs of gay, lesbian, and transgender youth. 

00:07:20
ANDREAS SMYAL, D.C. 

00:07:20
ANDREAS There have been problems where the stigma around AIDS and HIV, as well as the reality have completely devastated and just ripped me apart emotionally. 

00:07:30
CRISSY SMYAL, D.C. 

00:07:30
CRISSY I think that HIV and AIDS prevention is taken more seriously now and I'm thankful for that but there still, you know, isn't really enough. 

00:07:45
RODNEY, SMYAL, D.C. 

00:07:45
RODNEY I take it very serious too and it affects, you know, the gay community very hard as far as, you know, they label black males or, you know, gay males period as the, you know, number one carriers of HIV/AIDS. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN A lot of the messages that were targeted in the early '80's or in the mid '80's were more towards white gay men and, and rightly so but the epidemic always existed amongst community of colors. But unfortunately, in the mid '80's, you know, those messages weren't really being tailored to communities of color. 

00:08:20
SEDRICK GARDNER Hillside Chapel and Truth Center, ATL 

00:08:20
SEDRICK GARDNER The greatest challenge I think at this point is 21 years within the epidemic, there are such large numbers of African American people who are positive and who have been infected with HIV disease. I think that no one within our community really recognized that this enormity. 

00:08:40
"A re-occurring nightmare" 

00:08:40
[music] 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN When you look at the statistics, AIDS is disproportionally impacting black people, no matter how you look at it. Over 54% of the new cases, over 60% of women, over 63% of children, over 50% of men, over 30% of gay and bisexual men, you know. So every single day, the disease gets darker and darker and darker. So we figured that it's not just a message, you know, it's the messenger. 

00:09:10
NARRATOR Too many people still don't know what the HIV virus is or how it affects our bodies. 

00:09:15
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases/NHI, D.C. 

00:09:15
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI In order for the virus to efficiently function in spreading itself throughout the body, what it does is that it gets into a cell that's activated and then it replicates itself. So you're dealing with an unfortunate paradox is that when the immune system sees the virus, in order to react against it, it gets activated, which is like pouring gasoline on a fire because as the immune system gets activated, it provides, as I have said, the engine for the propagation of the disease process itself. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN I'm HIV positive. I was diagnosed, uh, with full blown AIDS over a decade ago. Uh, in 1996, I got very, very sick. In fact, my doctors didn't think I was going to survive, uh, and as a result of that episode, I in fact had to stop working for a few years and with the new therapies that are available, you know, fortunately I got better. 

00:10:10
DR. HELENE GAYLE Rep. Centers for Disease Control 

00:10:10
DR. HELENE GAYLE Early on, when these new therapies, the combination therapies, were first, um, discovered and first starting to be used, uh, around 1996, we saw headlines that, that indicated or suggested that the epidemic was over, that we had found a cure. Uh, and so I think this led all of us into, um, the whole nation, into a certain sense of, uh, of false security about this epidemic. 

00:10:35
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI And essentially everyone, not all, but essentially everyone who was doing well on therapy when we empirically stop the drug to see if, in fact, we had eradicated the virus, in virtually all of them, the virus came right back up to it's level that it was prior to therapy, indicating, I think, beyond any doubt, that at least with the regimens of drugs that we're using now, we are not able to eradicate the virus, which leads us to the next question, is well, if you can't eradicate it, what about long term control? 

00:11:05
VERNON HARRIS Former Inmate, NYC 

00:11:05
VERNON HARRIS I knew at that time that there was help for this, um, this illness. I went looking for the help, you know, because I didn't wanna suffer, so to speak, and I knew that the advent of (inaudible ) inhibitors, uh, was something that was helping people to prolong their life, the ones who were infected with this illness. 

00:11:25
NARRATOR Vernon Harris survived the jail sentence and the uncertainty of living with HIV. 

00:11:30
VERNON HARRIS You know, you just have to ask for help. You have to, um, realize that you're not in this alone and you may need help. Who do you go to for help? 

00:11:40
JOANNE PAGE The Fortune Society, NYC 

00:11:40
JOANNE PAGE I, I think that when people come out of prison with HIV, they're scared of stigma and so they come guarded or often people won't reveal their HIV status at all until they feel safe. 

00:11:55
VERNON HARRIS I found out about Fortune, um, Society through a, a prison outreach program. There was a young gentleman by the name of Troy Armstrong. He used to come up to (inaudible ) Correctional Facility and he would tell us about, um, Fortune Society, about how they were gonna build a castle, as Allen spoke about, to, um, help people into the transition once they're released from prison, to have somewhere to go. 

00:12:20
JOANNE PAGE When the Fortune Society started in 1967, HIV wasn't an issue for us. When I came as executive director in 1989, I realized that just about everybody walking through our doors was either HIV positive, loved somebody HIV positive, or were scared they were positive. 

00:12:35
VERNON HARRIS When I came to Fortune Society, um, I was searching for some type of support group, um, to help me to deal with my personal problems, things of that nature, such as being HIV positive and, um, my drug use problems. 

00:12:50
JOANNE PAGE HIV poses enormous challenges to anybody who's affected. The experience of incarceration layers on a level of trauma, a layer of damage, a level of dysfunction that I think is unconscionable. 

00:13:05
ROMEO SANCHEZ Prisoner's Rights Project, NYC 

00:13:05
ROMEO SANCHEZ When, when you're coming up in the streets, you have a, a certain image that you need to maintain and in prison, you certainly have to carry that. You have to either be tough or act tough. You know, practice looking tough because otherwise the choices are you fight in prison to defend your manhood, or your manhood is taken. 

00:13:25
VERNON HARRIS If, if a young person was to come to me and explain to, to me that he is HIV positive and he's frightened. Um, he doesn't know what to do, things of that nature, I'd probably try and keep him with me the majority of the day and walk him through some things that I've been through in my life, some of the fears that I had to overcome, um, once I found out I was HIV positive. It can become frightening. Um, you're gonna have your moments where you cry. 

00:13:50
MALIK WILLIAMS And so the question I wanna put to you all is what do you think is preventing the messages from getting to... 

00:13:55
ANTHONY McWILLIAMS AID Atlanta, ATL 

00:13:55
ANTHONY MCWILLIAMS Ultimately, we have to settle back in to the reality that each individual's HIV status is their own responsibility. That wasn't my responsibility. My responsibility was to connect you to resources, connect you to AID Atlanta, to get you in touch with what can help you in, in these crazy worlds of having to make these kind of decisions. It wasn't my responsibility to keep you negative. That is ultimately your responsibility. 

00:14:20
MALIK WILLIAMS AID Atlanta, ATL 

00:14:20
MALIK WILLIAMS I think for me the biggest challenge really is dealing with my own despair and my own feelings of powerlessness around this epidemic 

00:14:30
ANTHONY MCWILLIAMS We shove the sexuality discussion into the closet so quickly and we won't, how can you address HIV and AIDS if you can't even have a conversation about sexuality? 

00:14:40
DR. DONNA FUTTERMAN Montefiore Medical Center, NYC 

00:14:40
DR. DONNA FUTTERMAN Right now, HIV prevention has become very politicized. There's people out there who are saying abstinence only. You can only teach kids about not having sex. Well, that's great for young people who aren't having sex, but more than half the young people in our country are sexually involved. So to politicize something that's a matter of life and death, I think has been very destructive. 

00:15:05
ARTHUR PADILLA Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League, D.C. 

00:15:05
ARTHUR PADILLA What happens is from a national perspective or from a really larger voice, a federal government voice saying, they're telling young people this, you are not okay. You are not, you are not fitting into the paradigm that is normal or part of our culture or part of our values. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Many people think that they won't get it because, probably when they're having sex, they're just like oh I wanna do it and even though they probably think oh, probably won't get, I mean, HIV. They're probably gonna be like oh no, but I love him. I don't think he's gonna have something. So, I mean, I don't know. 

00:15:45
JESSICA M. Montefiore Adolescent AIDS Program, NYC 

00:15:45
JESSICA M. The parents don't talk to their children about sex. Like my mother doesn't talk to me about sex. So I came here and I learned a whole bunch of things about sex and HIV and STDs and I was like wow, but where did all this come from and, you know, I'm living in this world. So it's, it's kind of scary that you don't know things that are affecting you right in your face. 

00:16:05
JESSICA R In the work that I do and seen how this affects my community, the way I feel is overwhelming in a sense because these are people my age and at some point in their life, they made the wrong decision. Not wrong, I don't wanna say the wrong decision but they made the decision that affected them for the rest of their lives. 

00:16:25
DR. DONNA FUTTERMAN It takes an average of 10 years from the time someone's infected until they become sick, so many of the people who are infected as teenagers aren't really aware that they're, have HIV or AIDS until they're in their 20's. So again, the problem is hidden in teenagers. 

00:16:45
GARY BELL Bebashi, Inc., PHILA 

00:16:45
GARY BELL I think the first barrier we find is denial. Whether they're HIV positive or HIV negative, there, there's really a state of denial about whether this is really going on and whether it's impacting us and then when we find they're HIV positive, um, there's really a sense that they, they don't wanna deal with it. They don't wanna deal with the news. They don't wanna tell anyone. They don't necessarily even wanna practice safe sex. They actually act as if they're not HIV positive. So a big point, an important point of what we're trying to do is get them to be responsible for their, their health, responsible for their behavior. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Well, I think first of all, there must be the understanding that, unfortunately, uh, AIDS is a, and HIV, is an equal opportunity employer. It crosses all strata. Uh, it is not just limited to certain, uh, to certain, a certain race, a certain lifestyle. Uh, there was a time when we would all, when, when most people believed that it was, it was exclusive to the, the gay community. Um, if that was ever true, it's not true now.

MARIO PALMA Montefiore Adolescent AIDS Program, NYC 

00:17:55
MARIO PALMA The way a gay man looks is not the way it's been depicted in the past. You know, you can have someone with a do rag and a, and a baseball cap and a basketball jersey that might engage with sex with some, with another man but still on the outside, he has this kind of, this uniform that doesn't present him to be someone that's gay. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN I look at how I told my family about being gay, about my sexuality, and you know, I guess I was sort of what you would call a late bloomer and I didn't tell my family about my sexuality until I was 26, uh, 26, 27 and that was probably one of the most difficult things that I ever had to do in my life, um, and I think that because of my family construct, you know, it didn't fit in with what they perceived was my life's path and when I told my family about my sexuality, it was a difficult thing because it was, I think, really one of the first times that I really sort of debunked or sort of shattered, in their eyes, what their life choices were for me. 

00:18:50
ANDREAS My name is Andreas Smith. I go by Dequon (ph). I'm 21 years old. 

00:18:55
RODNEY My name is Rodney Wright. I go by Monteire (ph) and I'm 21 years old. 

00:19:00
CRISSY My name is Christina Cole Williams. I go by Crissy and I am 21 years old. 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN SMYAL youth are generally between the ages of 13 and, um, 21. Most of 'em are between the ages of 16 and 19. That's the majority of them. 

00:19:15
CRISSY Um, I first heard about SMYAL when I was 16 years old. I was just coming out. I was not Crissy then. I was, um, little Chris back then and I found out about it in school. 

00:19:30
RODNEY Um, I started coming here because I had no one to talk to about my sexuality or anything, just coming out and stuff. 

00:19:35
CRISSY SMYAL is a place where you learn to gain that confidence and say hey, it's all right for me to be this way. It's all right for me to be if I choose bisexual, if I choose homosexuality and it's okay for us, you know, to get along with everyone and that's how I identified with myself and coped with life. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN I think the way, particularly young people, uh, are identifying themselves, they're, they're not locking themselves into one thing, gay or bi, or, I mean, many of them are questioning. Um, many of them feel, uh, that the labels don't really, uh, accurately describe who they are. 

00:20:15
CRISSY Well, being transgender, I felt that HIV and AIDS is a very serious issue. Being as though I take hormones and you know, that automatically begins to weaken your immune system. So I have to really take care of myself. 

00:20:30
"L" AID Atlanta, ATL 

00:20:30
L I was this way, this open, this out, this expressive, when I was 7 years old, um, but even just because I was expressive, I didn't even articulate it as being gay when I was a younger, when I was a teenager, when I was in elementary school. 

00:20:45
DR. WILBERT JORDAN Infectious Disease Specialist, L.A. 

00:20:45
DR. WILBERT JORDAN When I talk to young people now, they don't see themselves in a category. We are putting the categories out there. They don't think of themselves as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any kind of sexual. They're themselves and their sexuality in that sense as we're talking about it, is really the least important. 

00:21:00
L Now that I'm gay, I'm openly gay and secure in my sexuality, I don't wanna have to battle the, the stigmas and the judgments that I deal with when I have to walk into these churches and so now... 

00:21:10
NARRATOR Traditionally, black churches have openly ostracized homosexuals, denying their very existence, turning a blind eye to the fact that gay men have been a part of the church experience since the very beginning. 

00:21:25
LARRY FERGUSON 

00:21:25
LARRY FERGUSON People have participated in church when church was not welcoming to them. People who, uh, who are part of this community have also been very instrumental in developing their own alternatives, um, in the sense of, uh, uh, a black gay church community. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN A few friends of mine who are, you know, deacons and assistant pastors or 11:00, you know, at the, at the, at the main line church, you know, uh, and then in the evening, they go to, you know, the black gay church in the, in the, in the evening with their community and it's the prayer that one congregation will not meet the other congregation. That the 11:00 congregation will, does not, does not learn that I'm, I'm actually also a deacon, you know, at the gay church, you know, in the evening. You know? And, um, you know, that's, that's a problem for our community. That we're, we're at a time when we need to, uh, create wholeness. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN What we do is instill with our young people the spirit is first, connection with God is first and that through that, you make good decisions and so we try to teach our young people how to make informed decisions that may add to prolonged life. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Here we are in the center of Harlem. If I went downstairs and, on the streets and said are you a gay male or are you a bisexual male, I better have my track shoes on ready to run. 

00:22:50
L You know, I wouldn't say, like, if I said I was bisexual, everybody in this table would try to, like, choke me but suggesting that just because I'm a homosexual man and I've made a conscious choice to be with men does not mean that I do not honor and appreciate women for their beauty and their sexual attraction. 

00:23:10
What you don't know can kill you... ...Get the facts. Get tested! 

00:23:10
J.L. KING HIV/AIDS Activist, CHI 

00:23:10
J.L. KING Down low means when you are having sex with both men and women and you do not consider yourself gay, bisexual or homosexual. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Well, what kind of bothers me about the down low, I mean, down low is a, is a, a label. Uh, for me, I think it's just sort of, uh, a media label. The phenomena of people being in the closet has been there all the, for a long time and it, and it certainly not confined to the black community. 

00:23:45
J.L. KING It's not new by no means but what keeps it on the down low is, in the black community, you can be a mad rapist, you could be the sniper that's killing people, but you cannot say you're having sex with men. We're pulled. You know, we have a desire to have sex with men. We have a desire to have sex with women. We know in our community we can't really be who we are, so we would rather put ourselves at risk and not even think about it to satisfy that desire of having sex with, with, uh, with men.

UNKNOWN The Gay Men's Health Crisis is the oldest AIDS service organization in the United States, the first in the fight against AIDS. We were formed even before the word AIDS was, uh, in existence.

NARRATOR GMHC is supporting programs geared toward gay youth, like Soul Food and the House of Latex.

ANTHONY MORGAN Soul Food, NYC 

00:24:40
ANTHONY MORGAN And what Soul Food does is provides educational, actually it's sort of psychoeducational groups, um, spiritual groups, support group for HIV positive, um, black men and also a creative outlet, which is a new project we're working with called Giovanni's Room, which actually takes a piece of James Baldwin work and, and, you know, we're playing with that, but what we do is we try to provide a space for, for issues, for sort of exploring different ways of life that, that, that are barriers for black men trying to sort of survive with these different identities. So that, that's sort of what we do.

DAVID RODRIGUEZ House of Latex, NYC 

00:25:20
DAVID RODRIGUEZ The House of Latex started in, uh, the late '80's, the the Mother of the House of Africa approached GMHC. Um, she noticed that there was no outreach being done in the, in the House and Ball community. They were being ignored when it came to prevention with HIV and STDs. We reached through as a community, so in that comes social networking and, um, you know, positive, like self-esteem assurance, um, skill building. So we offer our method of prevention is through many forms of prevention, not just condom usage.

UNKNOWN I think individuals who, uh, who feel good about themselves, uh, who feel affirmed are, are more likely to, to be sexually responsible in a sense of, uh, of, of being, um, uh, cognizant of protecting themselves as well as other people.
