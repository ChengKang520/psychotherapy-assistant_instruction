MARSHA LINEHAN Hello everyone. Thank you for coming. Uhm, you're gonna see me move around a little bit because I sometimes can't stand the whole time. And if I do, I'll just move back and put knees up, and I hope you don't mind. But I'm gonna start with, ah, telling you what I'm gonna do. And now I'm gonna sort of be explaining what it is. And while all that's happening, I need to have some volunteers. And for each one of this, I'll tell you what kind of volunteer I need. But I'm gonna teach you first chain analysis and we're gonna do a practice of chain analysis. I'm gonna need a really good person with really problematic behaviors. Unfortunately, you can't roleplay this because roleplays don't work so it has to actually be a real situation. You can't be one of your clients, which I'm sure you'd prefer. But still you have to think of something. So we need somebody, ah, who has dysfunctional behavior that they would like to change. Well, listen, I know of sorts have really good dysfunctional behaviors just in case. Those who are here we hear last time, we have this wonderful one of a person who always went to church late even though her husband was a minister. And we had a fabulous time. So then it had to be something that would be too humiliating. And my advice is not to do that because this video I was gonna be seen God knows by who. So it's gonna be real, but not so terrible, so, you know, having in the fear that your husband does no balance and not the balance. That's a chain analysis. So a chain analysis, if you can read this, is for when, ah, you engage in ineffective behavior. Okay. It, ah, you know, and psychotherapy, you parallel that, that's dysfunctional behavior but I asked one of my clients two weeks ago, I said, you know, that may-- what I-- you know what I'm talking about when I say dysfunctional she is in now. I said, "Oh, how about if I say ineffective? You know what that mean? She said, "Yeah." I said, "Good, I'm changing all my stuff." All right. So a chain analysis analyzes. The reason is called this is because it analyzes the chain of events that lead to ineffective behavior and examines the consequences of that behavior and focuses on. That's, that's the assessment. Once you have the assessment done, it also focuses on every time you come to an ineffective part of the chain-- sorry, I don't have this whole thing, you can't see the whole thing. I've done such a great job, I thought, but obviously not. Uhm, you start looking at the consequences of the behavior that make it hard to change them. This being one of the single biggest problems in therapies, I think, watching therapists, the millions of dollars-- not millions, but loads. Oh, too defying. Thank you. Let's all clap. You brought me a chair. Certifying. This what happens when you're 70, just be ready. Oh, so much better. Thank you. Okey-dokey. So I was practicing radical acceptance. And you probably didn't even notice it. It's because I've practiced it a lot. Okay. Next, so what-- so one of the biggest problems of therapies is that they don't pay attention to consequences of behavior and notice that was controlling the behaviors of consequence. Now chain analysis allows you to examine that hypothesis but you also want, of course, solely a hy-- you wanna be looking at the causal factors. In other words, what's stimulating other, what the-- what variables are setting it off. Okay. Now, the one I think what I wanna tell you about a chain analysis, and I'm just giving you a little information here as we go. A chain is one chain. So even if you find that a behavior got reinforced once, you could never say that's what causes the behavior to stay. Because one chain does not do that for you. Okay? So you can never make a causal statement about one assessment. So generally, what we advised people to do of the same behavior is to do chain analysis, uhm, frequently and tell you have a set of chains of events, they're the typical chains to that person's problematic behavior. My exper-- this is purely clinical experience. My experience had been that the average person for the average dysfunctional behavior has around five chains. But not too many more. In other words, there's not an, you know, an unlimited number of ways people get in trouble. And so you don't keep doing chains once you know that chains cuz then you can say, "Okay, as this, this one, this one, this one," and then you start working. Then at that point, you start working on how to change the behavior. In other words, we're in the chain which you have a chance of doing something different. Okay? And then, uhm, the current way we teach it to clients, cuz this is now, of course, is a skill in DVTs that chain analysis skill so we discovered not only can therapist do this, but clients can do it, you can do it on yourselves. It turns out they're very effective and to help you figure out and understand behavior. So the next one that you do is then if you've, you've figured out have you done a damage and how would you repair it. And, uhm, really one of the most important other factors that you went into with clients is that it's amazing to me that people don't know how to repair damage, primarily because they never figure out what damage they did. Okay? So, for example, I have a client who tries to kill herself again and knows that I don't like that which I don't so she brings me flowers as if the problem was that, ah, she'd taken away my flowers by trying to kill herself. But it was not the damage that she did and so trying to repair something that's not the damage is really where the problem is. So in general, when we do chain analysis, we also try to help people. Now, the people that I work with are im-- ah, unbelievably non-skilled at noticing the damage of their own behavior on others. So, a chain analysis allows you to start talking about what effects do you think that had on yourself and on others then you have to really repair or correct. And from there you can do what we do and I'm gonna show you so much how to do this and this time it's called correction over correction. So correction over correction is when you do something to correct what you did. So, if you stole something from someone, you give it back, okay. And over correction is you go a little bit further. Maybe you buy them another book or something like that. So, it's a little bit like if you spill milk on the floor, you clean the milk up and you clean the whole kitchen. And using correction over correction has mean that we almost rebuilt our clinic cuz we've had clients kicking walls so they had to fix the wall and then fix the whole room, we've had people trash our, our, our entrance so they had agreed to that and make it look better. So we have had a percent of people who ran out of group and what the damage was that they lost my dress and I was anxious. So they had to hire a person to sit outside the group whenever they were there so I wouldn't have to worry. So with all kinds of good things come from correction over correction, so I wanna encourage you to work on it with your clients. Okay. So that's a chain. So I'm gonna-- or I need some of you to be-- I need a volunteer. This is no fun at all if don't have volunteer group. I mean, none at all. Okay. Now the second thing I'm gonna teach you, this is my fabulous new skill. I haven't even polished this, okay? Well, I do skills training if people don't do their skills, homework, assignment, whatever the practice they're supposed to do, we always do analysis for got-- what got in the way. And the key to all of this stuff, both chain and also the same missing links is being to do it in such a way that doesn't come across as critical to the person. I mean, this is really the key to the whole thing. There is-- so you can't come across this meanspirited judgment or any of that. So I was-- ah, so I have a particular way of doing analyzing missing behavior. So it's kind of when a person is not down to something that they were expected to do or that was needed, okay? So it's called the missing links analysis. And the way it got to be a skill is I'm now doing work with high risk for suicide to adolescence and we do our skills training with their parents and the adolescence at once what a trip this has been. And, ah, really I love these kids and I love their parents too. And, ah, so, ah, the-- we do this all the times but then once the parents doing their homework, so I told their daughter, I said, "Why did she do the analysis on this?" I said, I said, "I'll give you the questions and you ask the questions and then we'll figure out what you should do as the answer." So you go right. So we did the whole thing and figured out the whole thing of what the problem was with the mom and how was she was gonna solve that problem next and bla, bla, bla. And at the end of-- she is-- we wanna know how to do that ourselves how do we do what you've just did. I said, "Okay, fine, I'll write it up for you." So if he's gonna write up for them, I teach it to everyone. So it's a new skill. Okay. So what I need now is to have a volunteer of someone who is suppose to do something that they didn't do. Now this one is so fast. I mean, it takes zero time practically. You can't waste time when you're teaching quirks. Are you having trouble hearing me? Oh, we've got volunteers? Oh, why can't I have a volunteer yet? But whoever the volunteer is, come and sit up here and be ready. But I have to interview slightly and make sure your problem fit. Okay. So the missing links is when you haven't done things that you need to do. But the problem with those is they go like this cuz you can't spend a lot of time on that kind of thing. It's not for-- ah, and the reason you can't spend a lot of time on it is because when you're doing a group, nobody wants to hear other people's failure to do homework and analyze for a long periods of time. So these aren't problem solving strategies. These are assessment strategies. Okay? All right. So before we get going, let's-- let me just go through the basic points we have. Okay. For a chain analysis, you have to-- there, there-- these are the components of it, okay? You can see up there on top. Can you read this? Oh, well, don't worry. I'm gonna tell you what it means. The first thing you do is you find out what is the problem behavior. You'd be surprised how many therapist think they know the problem behavior of that asking about it. So you have to get a good description. Okay. And when people cut themselves and stuff like that, I usually look to see, you know, their skin or whatever, or whatever they really did. Okay? And that's the first thing you have to do. Then you go back to-- the next thing you do is you do the prompting event. The prompting event is what happened right before the urge to engage in the behavior occurred or the behavior itself occurred if it was sort of automatic like that. So in other words, when did the first time the thought show up? Okay. What happened right before that. So the question is something like, uhm, you did it three o'clock in the afternoon, how is it you didn't do it at 10 in the morning? In other words, why, why was it three instead of 10? Okay. So you're finding out exactly what the prompting event was. Now once you get the prompting event, you o-- usually often wanna know how is it that that prompting event prompted anything? So you're generally, like, like a-- let's say, it was an urge to kill yourself. Okay. So for example I have, I have one client who comes in, we-- ah, he's one of my teams, and, ah, I said, "Well, ah, what was your highest urge to kill yourself?" "Five, on a scale of one to five." Fi-- I said, oh, I said, "Well, what prompted that?" "I was angry at my mother." I said, ah, "So was it just the anger?" She said, yeah. I said-- she said, "Whenever I get angry." I said, "How is it getting angry would set off why are you killing yourself?" She said, "well, whenever I get angry I wanna kill myself." So in general, this is an important thing to have found out by the way. That I get angry, the first thought in my mind is I'm gonna kill myself. Okay. And it turns out, in this particular case is I'll kill myself and prove and show my mother what a jerk she is. She'll feel sorry when I kill myself. So don't forget, sometimes people kill themselves for that reason. So what, anyway, but then you wanna look at, what's the vulnerability? In other words, what event did the mo-- what did the mother do to set that often? And how is it that that had such a big impact on you? It sets the vulnerability factor. So for example, if you-- if your boyfriend broke up with you the day before and then the next day your boss tells you you're not doing a good job at work, that's gonna have a much bigger impact on you than if the day before your boyfriend had asked you to marry him. Okay? So in other words, you always wanna be thinking about, how is it that on this particular day that particular event had such an effect? Is there some factor before. PTSD being a perfect example of a vulnerability factor. Because I got raped in an alley, I'm afraid to wanna go in alleys. Okay. So you wanna remember that. So, uhm, then you wanna-- then you started looking at link to link to link. In other words, ah, you have to very behavioral here. It's like exactly what happened, exactly what-- and what happened is what did you do, what did you think, what did you feel, and what happened in the environment. So you've got the environment, thoughts, feelings, action, and you want everyone of those as you go. Okay? So, uhm, that's essentially what the process is and you're gonna see me do that. So I think I'm gonna, uhm, do that first. And maybe I'll tell you about missing links first because they're quicker, very easy to share with you. So let me go down and show what the missing links is. Uhm, the missing links is simply a series of questions that you ask and what it is is you ask the, the first-- so I'm not gonna tell you what the series of questions is, I realized, because I wanna ask the person who comes up these series of questions. But the questions are designed to get you to where your would problem-solve. So I'll do one or two of this and then I can go over with the actual questions. So, so every-- so do we have anybody with missing behavior? Do we have volunteers? You've got it good. Okay. Did you sign your paperwork? You're all ready? Okay. Come on over. Okay. So if you sit here. So your name is? 

00:15:50
LYN Lyn. 

00:15:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Hi Lyn. 

00:15:50
LYN Hi. 

00:15:50
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm Marsha. Okay. Are you a therapist? Wait a minute, do you have your sound thing on? They, they wanna hear you as much as me. Okay. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you've got a behavior that's missing, right? 

00:16:15
LYN Yes. 

00:16:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Too fabulous for words. 

00:16:20
LYN Thank you. 

00:16:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You can put it there or you can just hold that. Okay. Sit down. Remind me of your name again. 

00:16:25
LYN Lyn. 

00:16:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Lyn. Okay. You're Lyn, I'm Marsha. 

00:16:30
LYN Thank you. 

00:16:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Nice to meet you. 

00:16:30
LYN Nice to meet you. 

00:16:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. I hope you feel honored at the end. 

00:16:35
LYN I have a feeling I will. 

00:16:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So listen, what's the behavior that was expected or needed that you didn't do? 

00:16:45
LYN I would like to be in shape. I, I look at a sport-- people who are sportsmen and they have this excellent built body. I don't wanna be a bodybuilder necessarily but I... 

00:16:55
MARSHA LINEHAN I'll get to that. But what specific behavior are we talking about? 

00:17:00
LYN I want to be in shape. 

00:17:00
MARSHA LINEHAN In shape is not a behavior, just be clear. And shape is a result of a behavior. 

00:17:05
LYN Okay. 

00:17:10
MARSHA LINEHAN If it were a behavior, I would be in shape. 

00:17:15
LYN Okay. Excellent. 

00:17:15
MARSHA LINEHAN What behavior do you actually want? 

00:17:20
LYN The behavior I want is to be able to eat right and to... 

00:17:25
MARSHA LINEHAN No, you don't wanna be-- you only wanna be able, you don't want to do it? 

00:17:25
LYN Okay. I want to eat ri-- well, right. 

00:17:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So stop. Okay. So we need to be much more specific here. 

00:17:35
LYN Okay. 

00:17:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So let's take today, let's take one instance, okay? So is there a behavior today that you wanted that wasn't there? 

00:17:45
LYN Yes. Exercise regularly. 

00:17:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you didn't exercise today? 

00:17:50
LYN I tried, but I didn't. 

00:17:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Wait a second. 

00:17:55
LYN I did like 100, uhm, dumbbells. 

00:17:55
MARSHA LINEHAN How, how is that not exercising exactly? 

00:18:05
LYN Exercise would have been to put in at least 30 minutes of workout, sweating, and something that will contribute to a better result that's supposed to... 

00:18:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So wait, wait a minute. You're-- it's gonna be very hard for you to figure out how to get this behavior if you don't know what the behavior is. 

00:18:20
LYN All right. 

00:18:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So the first thing we have to do is figure out exactly what behavior is do you want. But we have to be specific cuz we have all this general things. I can understand why it would be so difficult. 

00:18:30
LYN Yes. 

00:18:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, so for me for example when I exercise, I do exactly 14 minutes, 14 minutes on my electrical trainer, 13 lower level-- ah, I mean, sorry, seven low and seven high. Okay. Now that's a specific statement. And either I do it or I doubt. Okay. And so what we wanna do is very hard to get a behavior to show up if you're ge-- if you're generalized like you're saying, "I wanna be thin or I wanna be in good shape or I wanna be this or I wanna be that." So what we have to work on with you is a specific behavior that you want that's not there. So today you did this, right? 

00:19:10
LYN Yes. 

00:19:10
MARSHA LINEHAN A 100 times? 

00:19:15
LYN About, yeah, a 100 times. 

00:19:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, okay. And so you want another behavior in and round of that, right? 

00:19:20
LYN Yes. 

00:19:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So what behavior was missing today? 

00:19:20
LYN Uhm, cardio? 

00:19:25
MARSHA LINEHAN What's cardio? That's not a behavior that I know of. 

00:19:25
LYN Oh, really. I guess I'm not very verbal. 

00:19:30
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm working on it. 

00:19:35
LYN I'm sorry. 

00:19:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Don't worry, you're gonna get good at this by the end. 

00:19:35
LYN I'm sorry. 

00:19:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Are you nervous facing them? Would you rather face me? 

00:19:40
LYN Oh. I, I actually do. I'd, I'd rather face you. 

00:19:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Would you rather just turn the table around-- the chair around a little bit? I don't think they want us to, but it will keep you up to be with this so that would be good. Would you ra-- are you uncomfortable? 

00:19:55
LYN I'm nervous, yeah, yes. 

00:19:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So why don't we turn your chair to your listener. Okay? 

00:19:55
LYN All right. Well... 

00:19:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Because I've, I've got to say-- ah, no, no, dear. That put you right in front of the people. You wanna just be facing me. That way you can kind of not pay attention to them. 

00:20:10
LYN All right. Thanks. 

00:20:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Because I want you to pay attention to me. 

00:20:15
LYN Thanks. 

00:20:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So just you and me anyway. 

00:20:15
LYN All right. 

00:20:15
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. 

00:20:15
LYN Thank you. 

00:20:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So and, and they're only laughing because they're enjoying. Okay. So, do you have any clients? 

00:20:25
LYN Yes. 

00:20:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So here's the deal. Just think of this. Think how much they're gonna admire you - 

00:20:30
LYN Thanks. 

00:20:30
MARSHA LINEHAN - for having done this. Plus you're gonna have a lot of leverage on that. You're gonna be able to say, "Look, if I could go up there in front of a thousand people and talk Marsha Linehan, for God's sake," you can do that little thing. So you've, you've got-- so just keep this in mind. 

00:20:45
LYN All right. Thanks. 

00:20:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I mean, you've got this, you've got-- yeah, this is really gonna be good when you get harmed. You can use this. 

00:20:55
LYN Thank you. That's, that's the whole-- that's the goal. 

00:20:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Yeah, yeah, so okay. So, what I wanna help you do this. 

00:21:00
LYN Yeah. 

00:21:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Just practice breathing. 

00:21:05
LYN All right. 

00:21:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Breathe it in, deepen. Okay. What you wanna do is hit your vagus nerve right here cuz that will just lower the action. Okay. So if you can't-- if you start getting anxious, and talk to me again, let's start at the beginning, come down. Okay. Because it's gonna be more useful cuz you'll remember better. All right? Are you ready? 

00:21:25
LYN Yes. 

00:21:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, good. Snail. Are you trained as a behavior therapist? 

00:21:35
LYN No. No. 

00:21:35
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. So here's the deal. If you're not trained as a behavior therapist, then we're doing a behavioral intervention. It's understandable that you would not think like me. Okay? 

00:21:40
LYN That's okay. 

00:21:45
MARSHA LINEHAN But I'm trying to get you think like me. 

00:21:45
LYN All right. 

00:21:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So that's what I'm working on. But it's not like you should be thinking about me before you get here. 

00:21:50
LYN Oh, yeah. 

00:21:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So keep that in mind. All right? 

00:21:55
LYN Oh, thank you. 

00:21:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. No, why would you? 

00:21:55
LYN Yeah. No, I think... 

00:21:55
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, I mean, hardly anyone in this place has behaviors. In my whole thing, I said, "How many of your behaviorals?" Like three people raised their hand, okay? 

00:22:05
LYN All right. 

00:22:05
MARSHA LINEHAN So you're in the majority here. 

00:22:05
LYN Yes. 

00:22:10
MARSHA LINEHAN And I'm in the minority. But never fear. 

00:22:10
LYN Okay. 

00:22:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm working on adding you to the majority. 

00:22:15
LYN Okay. Exemplary minor. 

00:22:15
MARSHA LINEHAN To the minority, sorry. Okay. Anyway, okay, so you see that? 

00:22:20
LYN Yes. 

00:22:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So here's the deal. Uhm, if you weren't in front of all this people, you wouldn't be this nervous. Just remember that. 

00:22:25
LYN Yes. 

00:22:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:22:25
LYN I believe you. 

00:22:25
MARSHA LINEHAN No, no, I'm sure it's strict. No. Okay, so let's go back. So, okay, so, you did a 100 of this, but the problem is there were some other behavior that you wanted. Okay, so what was that behavior? 

00:22:35
LYN More of it. More... 

00:22:40
MARSHA LINEHAN How much more? We need to be specific. 

00:22:40
LYN About a 1,000 of it at least or, uhm, combined... 

00:22:45
MARSHA LINEHAN In the morning? 

00:22:45
LYN Yes. Or combined... 

00:22:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Before you came-- went to anything? 

00:22:45
LYN I'm sorry? 

00:22:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Is this possible? 

00:22:50
LYN Yes. I've actually done that once in the evening. Uhm, it was evening. I did it only once. 

00:22:55
MARSHA LINEHAN In your lifetime once or... 

00:22:55
LYN Like about a week ago or two weeks ago. 

00:22:55
MARSHA LINEHAN A week ago? 

00:22:55
LYN Yeah. 

00:22:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Is this a reasonable expectation at this very time? I mean, does this make sense? 

00:23:00
LYN Okay. That's a very good question. 

00:23:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:23:05
LYN I'm not aware. I am-- I have-- I don't have the discipline of, uhm, exercise in my life and... 

00:23:10
MARSHA LINEHAN No, no, we're not on discipline right now, we're on, is it reasonable to do 1,000 of this? 

00:23:15
LYN Yeah, why not? Why not? People do it all the time. 

00:23:15
MARSHA LINEHAN How long, how long, how long does it take? I don't know cuz I've never done any of this. So I might-- you're a mercy here. How long does it take to do a 1,000? 

00:23:25
LYN Well, I guess, if I, uhm, put-- set my mind to it and I dedicate my - 

00:23:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Uh-hmm. 

00:23:30
LYN - time to it and motivate myself, probably I will be able to do it within an hour. 

00:23:35
MARSHA LINEHAN And do you wanna do one hour of exercise everyday? 

00:23:40
LYN Yes. That's would be ideal. 

00:23:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Thank you. Okay, so we've got it. One-- and it's-- and that's what you wanna do in the hour? 

00:23:45
LYN Yes, that or any other exercise. 

00:23:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So in other words the behavior that you want is one hour of continuous exercise. 

00:23:50
LYN Yes. 

00:23:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Would you say continuous? 

00:23:50
LYN Yes, absolutely. 

00:23:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. That's correct. 

00:23:55
LYN Yes. 

00:23:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, good. We want one hour continuous, but you didn't do it this morning. 

00:23:55
LYN I'm late. 

00:24:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So now, we're gonna get to the missing links analysis which is, did the thought of doing, uhm, did the thought of doing, uhm, an hour of exercise enter your mind this morning? 

00:24:15
LYN No, not exactly. I just thought it's, it's time to do exercise and I should be doing the exercise. So I just did like 100. 

00:24:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, uhm, so the problem-- was the problem then par-- partially that the idea of doing an hour never enter your mind? 

00:24:30
LYN Probably. 

00:24:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So if you want, you should do it everyday. How do we get you? Do you wanna do this everyday? 

00:24:35
LYN Yes, I would love to do this at least... 

00:24:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Is this, is this plan? I mean, it's the realistic plan? 

00:24:40
LYN Yes, yes. 

00:24:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you wanna do it everyday but the thought didn't come into your mind. If the thought doesn't come into your mind, I guarantee you you're not gonna do it. 

00:24:45
LYN Right. 

00:24:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So what we have to figure out is how would you give that thought to come in your mind everyday? 

00:24:55
LYN I can write it on the mirror. 

00:24:55
MARSHA LINEHAN What, what mirror? 

00:24:55
LYN Every mirror that I have. 

00:24:55
MARSHA LINEHAN In your whole house? 

00:24:55
LYN Yes. 

00:25:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Is that reasonable? 

00:25:00
LYN Yes. That's ac-- absolutely reasonable. 

00:25:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Are you sure? 

00:25:00
LYN Yes. I have done things like that before and it works because I, I love my mirror. 

00:25:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Okay, good. Okay. So you're gonna write it on your mirror? 

00:25:10
LYN Yes. 

00:25:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And if you write it on your mirror and the thought comes into your mind and you remember to do it, what's probably you're actually going to do? 

00:25:20
LYN 50-50 probably. 

00:25:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So in other words, even if you wanna do it, you might not do it? 

00:25:25
LYN Yes. 

00:25:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So how are we gonna solve that problem? 

00:25:30
LYN Ah, I probably need to schedule. I have to, uhm, find a way, a constant reminder or, or a constant motivator for myself because I do have-- certainly, I have constant excuses for why I shouldn't be doing it right now, why I shouldn't be doing... 

00:25:45
MARSHA LINEHAN You realize that's a judgmental statement to say, "I have excuses"? 

00:25:50
LYN Really? 

00:25:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, just like I make excuses. But it could be that you actually have reasons not to do it. 

00:26:00
LYN Okay. That's so nice. Thank you. 

00:26:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Don't you think it's possibility? You actually have reasons not to do it? 

00:26:05
LYN Possible. 

00:26:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So if we look at those reasons, do you think you'd have to go backwards and say, do you think it's reasonable to think that you could do an hour everyday - 

00:26:15
LYN Yes. 

00:26:15
MARSHA LINEHAN - if you actually have reasons not to do it. 

00:26:15
LYN Yes. I'm sorry, what was the question? 

00:26:20
MARSHA LINEHAN How would you solve the reason? Like, give me a reason not to do it. 

00:26:25
LYN Okay, the reason would be, unfortunately, ah, it would be, uhm, if I continue exercising everyday I will be in a better shape and automatically I'll start thinking I will look desirable. I will-- and it's... 

00:26:35
MARSHA LINEHAN No, no, that's the reason to do it, right? 

00:26:40
LYN Yes, that would be a reason to do it - 

00:26:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So... 

00:26:40
LYN - and that's where it gets to... 

00:26:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So let's work on what are the reasons not to do it. When you wake up in the morning and the thought comes to your mind. 

00:26:45
LYN Yes. 

00:26:45
MARSHA LINEHAN And then you have a reason not to do it. What's the reason not to do it? 

00:26:50
LYN Variety of reasons. 

00:26:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Well give me one. 

00:26:50
LYN Well, I can sleep a little bit more instead. 

00:26:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, I'm tired. 

00:26:55
LYN I feel tired, yes. 

00:26:55
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm tired-- I feel tired or I am tired? 

00:26:55
LYN Ah, I'm, I'm-- I am tired, but, but if someone knocked on the door... 

00:27:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Good. Let's just-- let's, let's, let's just go with that, "I am tired." 

00:27:05
LYN Yes. 

00:27:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. All right. So, are you tired because you're not getting enough sleep, or are you tired? So why are you tired in the morning? 

00:27:15
LYN Because I'm trying not to work out. I am just-- that thought of working out is exhausting. 

00:27:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Wait a minute. What? Wait a second. 

00:27:20
LYN Because the... 

00:27:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You mean, you wouldn't be tired if you didn't have to exercise? 

00:27:25
LYN If someone-- like, if someone knocked on the door, and said, "I have pizza for you," I would jump out of the bed and run for the pizza. I wouldn't mind, I would even like pizza... 

00:27:30
MARSHA LINEHAN That doesn't mean that-- but that doesn't mean you're not tired. 

00:27:35
LYN Right. 

00:27:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, so, is that the number one thing that happens it's when you wake up you seem tired? 

00:27:40
LYN That's the excuse I give myself. 

00:27:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Excuse or the reason? 

00:27:45
LYN The reason would be... 

00:27:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I'll just wanna point out to you that you put yourself down a fair amount. 

00:27:50
LYN Okay. That sort of motivates me to, to, to rise above my problems and my excuses. 

00:27:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, I see. In other words, you're motivated by putting yourself down and saying you'd be a better person? 

00:28:00
LYN Yes. 

00:28:00
MARSHA LINEHAN How about if you'd just said you'd be happier if we did what you wanna do? 

00:28:05
LYN Huh? I would be happier if... 

00:28:05
MARSHA LINEHAN If I did what I wanted to do. 

00:28:10
LYN I would love that. 

00:28:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, good. Let's stick with that. 

00:28:10
LYN Okay. 

00:28:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Now, so here's the deal. I'm not gonna go too much further with you because generally, uhm, the missing links analysis right now would be complete because we would know now that what we had to do was deal with what you say to yourself in the morning. Okay? 

00:28:30
LYN Okay. 

00:28:30
MARSHA LINEHAN However, I will discuss in such a good soul and give you an idea. Okay? Mainly cuz I do exactly the same thing every single morning, okay? 

00:28:40
LYN All right. 

00:28:40
MARSHA LINEHAN However, I have a way to get up. But you'd have to find out if this true for you. You do pros and cons, okay, in your mind. 

00:28:50
LYN Okay. 

00:28:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, for example, for me, I say I'm really too tired I should stay in bed and get more sleep rather than getting up and going in exercise. Okay? However, I then say to myself, "Hmm, that doesn't fit the research. If I exercise, I'll be more energized during the day and if I stay out of bed. So I actually need this exercise more than I need staying in bed." And that's how I get out of bed. Mainly because I've sold myself a very good sales one, which happens to be true. What would happen if you said that to yourself? 

00:29:25
LYN Well if I do it, I will, I will be more desirable. I will obtain more attention. I will be having more options to choose, ah, ah, a guy for myself, a man for myself. And that's not-- that's discouraging because then I would be doing for some guy who's not there for me right now when I need a man and it's not for me. Apparently, it's not for me, it's for somebody else. 

00:29:50
MARSHA LINEHAN So let's skip all that. Let's drop all that. 

00:29:50
LYN I would love to skip on that. 

00:29:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Let's just skip that. Your, your point is a good point. How about saying you'll feel better? 

00:30:00
LYN I love that. That actually did help once for a little. 

00:30:05
MARSHA LINEHAN How about saying, "I'll feel better about myself"? Cuz it'll give you a sense of mastery and confidence. 

00:30:10
LYN Yes. 

00:30:10
MARSHA LINEHAN That's during confidence through the offset of being depressed. So, that's good. And if you're looking for a man, you therefore gonna be able to fight depression. 

00:30:20
LYN Yeah, I agree. 

00:30:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, exactly. Okay, so you need something that will keep you mobilized and will keep you happy, mastery and confidence. Okay. And secondly, you'll actually be less tired if you get up and exercise. 

00:30:30
LYN I agree. I agree. 

00:30:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So pros and cons. The truth to have the pros and cons for yourself. 

00:30:40
LYN Okay. 

00:30:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Is this helpful at all? 

00:30:40
LYN Yes, yes. I just need to write it down and, and probably if I... 

00:30:45
MARSHA LINEHAN The first thing you need to do is put everything on your mirror. 

00:30:50
LYN Yes. Yes, the longer the list, the better. Probably motivating... 

00:30:50
MARSHA LINEHAN The-- but the other is to say once you give yourself a certain amount, once-- first of all, how about bringing it down for-- do-- or do you wanted to do it seven days a week or five days a week? 

00:31:00
LYN Probably seven days a week. 

00:31:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I'm gonna suggest that it's knocked down to five. In fact, other suggestions, knock it down to sometimes doable and then you do-- do you know what shaping is? 

00:31:10
LYN Yes. 

00:31:15
MARSHA LINEHAN That you shape yourself into more. 

00:31:15
LYN I'd like that. 

00:31:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So you could either do-- you could say three days a week. 

00:31:20
LYN Okay. 

00:31:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Five days a week. What's gonna work? 

00:31:25
LYN I, I get-- ah, I, I think I get-- can get addicted very well so if I start from three, I will automatically push myself to get up more and do more. And the, the, the discouraging part probably will be what, what has been in the past, like, "I'm exhausted, I keep doing this everyday. I can't do it." But at least, if I put myself, ah, ah, on a schedule of three days a week, that would probably help me out. 

00:31:50
MARSHA LINEHAN I just wanna point out to you. If doing the exercise is making you discouraged, it's possible that you've overdone the idea of 1,000. Are you sure you have to face the fact that you may have gotten the behavior for yourself that's way too extreme. 

00:32:10
LYN I, ah, I wanna see result. 

00:32:10
MARSHA LINEHAN One hour of exercise I don't think is extreme but it maybe that what you need to do is have a more reasonable expectations. What do you think? 

00:32:25
LYN All right. I guess I could reasonably expect myself to work out an hour a day and, uhm, not give myself breaks between within the one hour and see where-- ah, how-- however, many I can push at. 

00:32:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So how many days a week are you going to add? 

00:32:40
LYN I guess I'm gonna have to set myself for three days only. 

00:32:45
MARSHA LINEHAN You're gonna start with three? 

00:32:45
LYN Yeah. 

00:32:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So the trick is not to say things like three days only. 

00:32:50
LYN Okay. 

00:32:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay? You realize that sort have put down, right? 

00:32:55
LYN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:32:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you wanna say, "I'm doing three days a week. Wow." 

00:33:00
LYN Yeah. 

00:33:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Then I'll go up. Okay? Okay. So what reinforcement you're gonna give yourself for doing this? 

00:33:05
LYN I will feel better. 

00:33:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:33:10
LYN I will not feel depressed. I will see the results. I will be able to enjoy the results and I will definitely be able to enjoy the outfits when I try them on. So I can-- when I go shopping. 

00:33:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Meaning, you're back to doing it for others. 

00:33:25
LYN No, no, for myself. 

00:33:25
MARSHA LINEHAN For yourself? Okay. 

00:33:25
LYN Yeah, but that's very easily links me to others. 

00:33:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, exactly. 

00:33:30
LYN Because people come... 

00:33:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So you wanna stick with, "I'll have a sense of mastery. I'll have a sense of confidence. I feel good about myself." 

00:33:40
LYN Okay. So no-- not about the looks because that's visible. But if itself co... 

00:33:45
MARSHA LINEHAN The real problem is you can't control the looks. You can only-- the only thing you can control is the behavior that you're engaging. 

00:33:50
LYN All right. I like that. 

00:33:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, you're not coming to see me next week. So who are you gonna report to? 

00:34:00
LYN I can email. 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I just wanna be clear. You're gonna have to write your name down just so all know if you didn't email me. 

00:34:15
LYN Yes. 

00:34:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:34:15
LYN Yes. 

00:34:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Because if I don't hear from you. 

00:34:20
LYN I would love to get back. 

00:34:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You, you won't, you, you won't wanna come next year? 

00:34:30
LYN Okay. Yes. 

00:34:30
MARSHA LINEHAN All right? 

00:34:30
LYN Yes. 

00:34:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:34:30
LYN Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Dr. Linehan. 

00:34:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

00:34:35
LYN I wanna give you a hug. Thank you. 

00:34:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I think you did, by the way, I think, I think in my personal opinion is that you did a fabulous job and that you helped all the people out here so let's see if that's true. Is that true? 

00:34:50
LYN Really? Thank you. 

00:34:50
MARSHA LINEHAN You did, really it's true. Okay. 

00:34:55
LYN Thank you. 

00:34:55
MARSHA LINEHAN That's the route. Okay. Okay, so that had a lot more problem solving than I would ever do in a group setting or usually with missing links. Usually missing links is one thing that I didn't do today. But what happened there was, ah, it moved a lot more into problem solving. In the individual therapy, I do a lot of problem solving. I would have actually probably probe much more, in that particular case, uhm, the function of the behavior. Although an hour of the exercise is a reasonable amount of exercise for most people, you know, on a daily basis, it means an unreasonable amount, a 1,000 of this seems unreasonable to me but that's because I couldn't do that. But if I could do it, it might be reasonable. Uhm, I do other things. And so, uhm, let me see what time it is. Okay. I have a couple of minutes for any questions on that particular one. I'm gonna move through chain analysis next so we've got people down here. But, ah, let me just ask if there are any questions. I can take probably two questions, three are the most. Are there microphones? If you yell, I can-- and I can hear you, I'll, I'll, I'll say it. There's-- can I put the missing links lie back up? This is the missing link. So here's-- ah, so let me actually-- instead of a question, let me go through-- I think it will be useful for you to have me go through the questions because they didn't work quite with her. The first missing links is, did you know the effective behavior was needed or expected? If a person says no, there's no point in going further. You know, because if they didn't know what, you-- now you've got to figure out how could you know what. Okay? And I asked her, did the thought go through your mind? And she said no. So the next thing was how are we gonna-- you know, if it doesn't hit your mind, why are you gonna do it? So that's the first one. Then you have to ask when you-- if, if they say no, then you solve that problem. If they say yes, it would hit my mind, then you have to ask at the time it was through your mind, did you wanna do it? Because if the version says, well, it went through my mind, well, I know I won't gonna do it. There's no point in going further. Now you have to solve that problem. How is it that-- how can we get you to want to do the behavior, okay? If they say, but I did remember that, then you say, did the thought come through your mind when it was needed? So like for-- in skills, I'll say, did you know you had assignment? Yes. Did you know what it was? Yes. Did you wanna do it at that time? My teenage will say, "No, I wasn't gonna do it." I knew I'm not gonna do it. Those are willful teenagers once we're acting willful. But the other one might say, "Yes, I want to do it." Then you have to say, "When you got home, we're in another time of your day, did it enter your mind?" What you get very often is no. And so-- or you'll sometimes get a yes. And now I'll say, "So what happened if it came into your mind? How is it you didn't do it?" At which point, what do you think everybody says? I put it off. I thought I would do it later. Then you say, "Okay, did it ever come into your mind later?" If they-- if it didn't, then you start having to figure out how can you get it come into your mind later, what can you do. And if it came into their mind and they kept putting it off, then you have to start working on how could you stop putting this off all time. And so in effect is a series of questions that each time you get a no on a-- or an answer, then you problem solve when you have to. Ah, otherwise you keep going. So, uhm, so I always start anytime anyone hadn't done something I always start with did, did you know you're supposed to do that. So it starts to add a very nonjudgmental approach. That's what this has got it going for it. So the client's experience you being ready to believe that the facts were they just didn't know they had to do it. And once you-- if that's true, then, then you say, "Okay, how could we solve that problem? How could we make it so that you do know?" So for example on our accords, we now text people once or twice a week, we send emails to people once or twice a week, we have a little-- everyone has a page with them and they can write down what skills they're supposed to practice during the week. And we've done an enormous amount to make it so that people actually know what they're supposed to be doing. Uhm, people don't want to do it, then we really put a lot of focus on the pros and cons. My own personal opinion, I've started really thinking through how is it the most of this get ourselves to do things? And if you really, really starts thinking about it, most of us do pros and cons all the time in our lives. Why do this? Why not? What will happen if I don't? And I've discovered that most of my clients don't do pros and cons. They just do dysfunctional behavior without really thinking about it. So I'm putting a lot more emphasis in my treatment with the clients on trying to get them to practice more often reviewing in their mind pros and cons. And, ah, everyone of our skills groups now we have a pros and cons page which is if you don't-- if you find yourself not wanting to practice this skill do a pros and cons. I mean, pros and cons for dysfunctional-- we have pros and cons for everything, really. And so trying to-- so I think most successful people do a lot of pros and cons, kind of automatically really without thinking about-- automatically in their mind. So that's where that comes in. Uhm, you know the problem is that I can't read my calendar. So I do-- I don't have a clock so I can't remember where I am. But suddenly, I'm almost out of time, but I know that I'm not almost out of time. So I got to 11:20. It's not close-- it's not 11:20 yet so-- 11:40. Okay, so I have time. Okay. So I'm gonna have to skip this. We all gonna have to work on helping me know what time it is cuz I have no timer up here. And my-- I'm run by clocks but I don't have a clock. Okey-dokey. Any other question on this? I'll take one more question if there one. Yell. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, that sounds like that except that it's set up in a-- as, as the skill that you can teach, give it, give it to parents, give it to everyone else to do. So the big difference between this, and it's got-- it also goes through. It doesn't start with what got in the way because it, it, it, it starts with, "Did you know you were suppose to do it?" So it has to say-- it's similar, it's very similar. There's, there's really nothing new in behavior therapy, let's be clear, and, uhm, that you can do. And, and so, it's just a more structured form of the same thing and it's organized in a way that you can teach clients to do it. You can teach parents to do it. You can teach anyone how to do it. That's really the only difference as far as-- I mean, what got in the way, uhm, shows up, ah, and it's-- at various point so that's very similar. I never read glass or stuff, but it's similar. Sorry to say there are a lot of people I haven't read. But you know, there's just so many books you can read in a day. Okay. Uhm, let's move now to chain. So I'll put the questions up here. Oh, does anybody have a question about the-- what I did with our person here? Hey, thanks. You've got to call me Marsha. People call me Dr. Linehan. I sometimes don't know who they're talking to. This is very hard to read though so I think it's gonna be unhelpful, I'm sorry to say. I'm really sorry to say. I've got 15 minutes over all for the whole thing? Okay. We're doing the chain. Who is my chain person? Okay. Now, can you tell me secretly? Can you tell me secretly? 

00:43:20
MARY Secretly with the microphone on or off? 

00:43:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Can, can you turn the microphone off once? I just got to find out what the problem is to make sure that we wanna do this. Tell me what... 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:45
MARSHA LINEHAN That's it. You can turn this on. Thank you. Okey-dokey. What is your name? 

00:43:55
MARY Mary. 

00:43:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Hi, Mary. 

00:43:55
MARY Hi. 

00:43:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha. Okay. I appreciate you're doing this, by the way, so does the entire audience. Okay. So have a seat. Thank you. Oh yeah, oh my God. Okay. So what-- I dwell too long on the other one so unfortunately we're gonna have to go a little bit fast here. 

00:44:15
MARY Okay. 

00:44:15
MARSHA LINEHAN But what's the behavior that were-- you're engaging in that you wanna not engage in? 

00:44:25
MARY Uhm, well, it's an emotional eating problem, particular Ben & Jerry's. I don't know if any other women in the room have... 

00:44:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So is the problem that you went to, you went to Ben & Jerry's more often that you wanna go or is it probably you went at all? 

00:44:35
MARY I-- well, I don't wanna eat Ben & Jerry's at all. 

00:44:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:44:40
MARY It's sort of like emotional stress eating after a long clinic day, usually. 

00:44:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. All right. Okay, I won't ask you why it's a problem. Let's just assume you don't wanna do it. 

00:44:50
MARY It's not good for health. 

00:44:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:44:50
MARY I'm turning 50 this year and I'm thinking about these things more. 

00:44:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So the behavior we're trying to solve is be-- it's not being at Ben & Jerry's after ther-- after a long day at the office? 

00:45:00
MARY Yeah, yeah. 

00:45:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So when is the last day that you stopped? 

00:45:05
MARY Well, uhm, you know, probably the last time that I bought a pint was, hmm, two or three weeks ago. But what happens is there's replacement behavior so I, you know, I'm not having to Ben & Jerry's but then I'm having other candy during the day instead. 

00:45:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Which behavior do you wanna work on? 

00:45:20
MARY Well, all the sweets. I really wanna get rid of the sweets. The doctor says... 

00:45:25
MARSHA LINEHAN But, but the problem is to do a chain, we had to find one. 

00:45:30
MARY One, okay. 

00:45:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Because you know you can't, you can't analyze and prove your behaviors. I mean, you can have a heart to heart talk about it, but it doesn't tell you too much. So we have to find your more serious event that you really actually remember. So can we-- maybe we could go back to buying a pint at Ben & Jerry's. 

00:45:45
MARY Okay. Yeah, and getting it at the grocery store, yeah. 

00:45:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you remember it? Do you remember it? 

00:45:50
MARY Uhm, yeah. Uh-hmm. 

00:45:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. More often than that? When is the la-- did you get it at the grocery store center? 

00:45:55
MARY No, I'll get it you know, probably, hmm, once every week or two. 

00:46:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:46:00
MARY I'll pick up a pint. 

00:46:00
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. So the object here is to not pick up and is to not take ice cream cup. 

00:46:05
MARY Uh-hmm. Right. 

00:46:05
MARSHA LINEHAN As that basically the goal. 

00:46:05
MARY I eat it all at once. 

00:46:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So that's the goal. 

00:46:10
MARY Eat it all at once then go to bed and sleep. 

00:46:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. All right. And you've decided not to do it, but you find yourself doing it anyway. 

00:46:15
MARY Right. 

00:46:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Is that right? 

00:46:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:46:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, good. Okay. So the last time you did it, it was when? 

00:46:20
MARY Two weeks ago, I'd say. 

00:46:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You'd say or for sure? I do-- just to be clear, to do a chain we really do pretty much have to get back to something you actually remember. 

00:46:30
MARY Okay. Uhm, yeah, for sure, two weeks ago. 

00:46:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So when did the urge to buy ice cream come into your mind? 

00:46:40
MARY Uhm, when I was in the grocery store. 

00:46:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Ah, so you hadn't thought of it any time during the day? 

00:46:45
MARY No, I was busy, you know, so I had clients all day. 

00:46:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you're in the grocery store and where were you in the grocery store that set this thought of? 

00:46:55
MARY By the frozen foods. 

00:46:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Is it by the frozen ice cream or the frozen food? 

00:47:00
MARY Uhm, anywhere near that isle. So I'm picking up milk, you know, and I know that it's just a mere 30 feet away. 

00:47:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Ben & Jerry? 

00:47:05
MARY Right. 

00:47:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So in other words, you don't have an urge to buy ice cream in the grocery-- in the grocery store? 

00:47:15
MARY No. I'm just feeling stressed. 

00:47:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:47:15
MARY You know, when I'm looking, I wanna relax somehow so I'm... 

00:47:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:47:20
MARY When I'm near the Ben & Jerry's, it calls to me. 

00:47:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you saw that and, uhm, were you actually feeling stress at the time? 

00:47:30
MARY Oh, yeah. Uh-hmm. 

00:47:30
MARSHA LINEHAN What are you stressed about? 

00:47:30
MARY Just tired. Long, long day. 

00:47:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And when you thought of getting-- when you've got the, when you've got the urge to get the ice cream, did anything else come into your mind like did you try to get yourself not to do it? 

00:47:45
MARY Yeah. Like I'm thinking I shouldn't be doing this, this isn't good for me, it's not what I wanna be doing. I'm not hungry, even, you know. 

00:47:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
MARY I just know that I'm in a feel good when I eat this. 

00:47:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:47:55
MARY And it taste good, and it's a treat, and I deserve a treat I had a long day. 

00:48:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So when you're tired, you have a long day, you want something to relax with, you know that ice cream relaxes you. 

00:48:10
MARY Uh-hmm. 

00:48:10
MARSHA LINEHAN If you go into a grocery store near the frozen food and those situations, does that ordinarily happen that you'll then get the urge to get Ben & Jerry? 

00:48:20
MARY Probably, yeah, mostly. Most of the time. 

00:48:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So in other words, uhm, big-- was this a big grocery store or a small one? 

00:48:25
MARY Smallish. 

00:48:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Grocery stores are dangerous in other words. Okay. 

00:48:30
MARY Seems like, yeah. 

00:48:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, all right. 

00:48:30
MARY Especially when I'm tired, stressed. 

00:48:35
MARSHA LINEHAN When you're tired. Okay. All right. Now, the facts that you knew that when the good idea, how is it that you ended up-- where do you go to Ben & Jerry's? 

00:48:40
MARY Pardon? 

00:48:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Where was Ben & Jerry? Did you get to Ben & Jerry in the store or somewhere else? 

00:48:45
MARY Yes, it's always in the store so... 

00:48:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, it's in the store, oh. 

00:48:50
MARY In Minneapolis, we don't have Ben & Jerry's other than what's in the store. 

00:48:50
MARSHA LINEHAN I say, in other words, it's buying ice cream at the grocery store. 

00:48:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:48:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So how is it that when you have the idea of doing it you said yourself it's not a good idea? How is it that you ended up doing it? What happened between this is not a good idea and getting the Ben & Jerry's? 

00:49:05
MARY Well, I have to go to the grocery store, you know, cuz we have to-- we need things... 

00:49:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I know, but you're in the grocery store thinking this way. 

00:49:10
MARY Yeah. 

00:49:10
MARSHA LINEHAN And so in the grocery store you're thinking this is not a good idea. It's in you've-- when you've got it. So what happened between, it's not a good idea and you're getting it? 

00:49:20
MARY Like I just have no control. 

00:49:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You said that to yourself? 

00:49:25
MARY No, I just seem to-- there seems to be no-- nothing I can say to myself that will stop it. You know, I'm just-- I'm there, I'm tired, I'm stressed, I'm close to the Ben & Jerry's, it just happens. 

00:49:35
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. 

00:49:35
MARY There's no stopping that. 

00:49:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So it's an automatic behavior? 

00:49:40
MARY Uh-hmm. 

00:49:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And the consequence is that you feel better when you eat it. 

00:49:50
MARY Yeah, but then I also feel worse cuz I'm thinking this isn't... 

00:49:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. You did-- you immediately enforce to work a lot better than long term-- than long term effects. So you get the immediate feel better which is kind of be more powerful than the next negative. 

00:50:05
MARY Uh-hmm. 

00:50:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. More than like that, in general. And so that's the real problem here so you get an immediate reinforcement when you made it. And since you've got a pattern of creating it, you've got the pattern of a highly reinforced behavior. So now what I'm gonna say about this is that we've done a chain, we know what the events are. The events are, had a hard day at work, very tired. I go-- I, I, I wanna feel better I go to the grocery store and they have the ice cream I like. I buy-- by the way, if they quit selling, ah, this and that kind of ice cream, do you think you'd buy something else? 

00:50:45
MARY No. The bar crunch is to die for. Never try it. I'd be good. I think I'd really be fine if, if it was-- if it didn't exist. 

00:50:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Uh-hmm. 

00:50:55
MARY It's just too tempting. 

00:50:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Uh-hmm. 

00:50:55
MARY Yeah. It's amazing. 

00:51:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So I know what the solution is, do you? 

00:51:00
MARY Uhm, well... 

00:51:05
MARSHA LINEHAN I'll listen to you. 

00:51:05
MARY If I never went into a grocery store, you know, life would be grand, but I have three kids and you know. 

00:51:10
MARSHA LINEHAN No, no, I don't think the problem is never going in. So in other words, on a Saturday morning, when you get up and go to the grocery store at 10 on a Saturday morning, will you buy ice cream, Ben & Jerry? 

00:51:20
MARY When I'm at work, uhm, but... 

00:51:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, no, no, not would-- not if you went on a Saturday morning at 10. 

00:51:25
MARY Yeah, I'm always at-- I'm seeing clients at that time but if I went to see, you know, on a day I'm not working at 10 - 

00:51:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:30
MARY - no, I'm not gonna buy it. 

00:51:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Right. Because you're not tired. 

00:51:30
MARY Yeah. 

00:51:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So it seems the problem is that when you're tired and you get the stimulus of grocery store and you have the highly reinforced behavior that in effect you're not doing well, ah, to continue yourself. So what we have to do is come up with the solution to how to, how to not buy it. So what we've got is the pattern, so we know what the pattern is, okay? So what's the predictors? The predictor is being tired. So can you do grocery shopping other than when you, ah, go out and get off and work on entire day. 

00:52:05
MARY Well, maybe, you know, like there's a lot... 

00:52:10
MARSHA LINEHAN What do you mean maybe? 

00:52:10
MARY Well, there's a lot of moving pieces. 

00:52:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:52:10
MARY I'm sure of it that like stage where I've got you know launching children and aging parents and you know, lots of, lots of plates in the air. 

00:52:20
MARSHA LINEHAN What time do you go to work in the morning? 

00:52:20
MARY Uhm, 6:30. 

00:52:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Morning? 

00:52:25
MARY Uh-hmm. 

00:52:25
MARSHA LINEHAN What time do you get up? 

00:52:25
MARY About 10:30 at night. 

00:52:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You work 6:30 to 10:30? 

00:52:30
MARY Yup. 

00:52:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, no wonder you want ice cream. 

00:52:30
MARY Yeah. But it works with my life though, you know, because my husband and I tag team with our kids so I do Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, he's Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It works for a lot in our life. 

00:52:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Monday, Wednesday, and Friday you're at home? 

00:52:40
MARY Yeah. It sounds like... 

00:52:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, good. That's the solution. 

00:52:45
MARY Oh, grocery is out there. 

00:52:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:52:50
MARY But then the house isn't get cleaned. You know, the meal doesn't get... 

00:52:50
MARSHA LINEHAN How long do you take to grocery and shopping? 

00:52:55
MARY Well... 

00:52:55
MARSHA LINEHAN No, you could do that when you come off from water. 

00:52:55
MARY At 10:30. 

00:52:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, if you can eat ice cream at 10:30. You can shift for sure and do the mail. My point is this, is that you have a high-- you're, you're going to eat-- or you have to figure out a way to either get the reinforcer down. Now your other option would be to do something to interfere with you buying it in the grocery store. Okay. One is to not go to grocery store when you have all this. But the other is to-- ah, the, the skill that you need is problem solving because, ah, pros and cons aren't gonna work because you're already doing them in the, in the header work. You're already tired of all the bad things about eating it and it doesn't work. So there's no-- you don't wanna use skills that don't work. So you need a new skill. So the, the skill you need is problem solving. So what would happen if you picked up one of your children and took him with you to the grocery store? 

00:53:50
MARY Well, it's 10:30 at night. 

00:53:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, it's 10:30. It's all bad. Okay. So, how are you gonna solve that? First of all, how important is it? I mean, if it's not important enough to go to groceries, you, you really have to ask yourself how important it is to solve that. Like, you could take someone with you. The other thing you could do-- you know, there are a lot of things to put in a negative consequence. Uhm, for example, you might do something like put something up on the kitchen and say that you will lie it down probably for your children to see every time you buy ice cream and eat it night. 

00:54:30
MARY Like a shame sort of thing or... 

00:54:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You've got it exactly. 

00:54:35
MARY But I'm mom, I'm perfect. 

00:54:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean, you know, my point is, is that thing that you have to do now is go through a series of problem solving. Because you're in a really difficult spot. Because anytime you've got a behavior that's been really highly reinforced. And so you're tired. It's difficult. You've had a hard day. Anybody would feel that way after working that many hours. And therefore, this little positive thing over here, you're still attractive so you can't tell yourself, "I'm not attractive. You know, I'm really obese," and all that, cuz you're not. You have a loving husband and loving kids. So really, you know, your incentives to do this are not the same as your incentive to eat ice cream. So what you're gonna have to do is find incentives that will get you not to eat it or to get rid of the stimulus by going at times when you don't feel that way. So one is to find the incentives to get you not to. And meaning incentives people have, you don't have. Because you seem to be doing fine. You know, ha-- cuz you tell me you don't have an eating disorder. So you seem to be doing fine not doing it. So it seems the incentive to eat it is stronger than the incentive not to. So you would have to modify that or change the stimulus, and go at other times. 

00:55:50
MARY Uh-hmm. It seems to be okay if I don't stop. If I don't stop at all, then I won't, I won't eat the ice cream. But maybe... 

00:55:55
MARSHA LINEHAN No, I've, I've got that. 

00:55:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:55:55
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm very clear that it's this grocery store that's you're at downfall. 

00:56:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:56:00
MARSHA LINEHAN And you're at grocery store at that time just listing to the chain of events. That's where the problem is. 

00:56:05
MARY Uh-hmm. 

00:56:05
MARSHA LINEHAN And then you could say it's only three moreover. And why not? 

00:56:10
MARY Yeah. 

00:56:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So you have to pass the grocery. Or you have to come up with the negative consequence strong enough to outweigh the positive consequence. And it would be better if you found something else at home that you would really like not to eat. Massage something positive that you can afford to have. 

00:56:30
MARY I've been trying to plug in things like that. You know, when I'm still at home, I'm tired and thinking, "Oh, sweets, I have to have sweets." So like I have this massager thing that I tried putting on which you know, like I would pick it up or broke stone or something and it's, it's great, but I'll do that and hand in sweets. You know. Or, uhm,... 

00:56:45
MARSHA LINEHAN No, what you have to do is find a competing positive behavior. So competing positive behavior might be that. I'm not gonna say drink alcohol. 

00:57:00
MARY Yeah. Everybody is in bed, you know. So I get home and the house... 

00:57:00
MARSHA LINEHAN I could-- I'm gonna say, you could-- you know, you could drink soda, water, or something with lemon and lime. But my point is you have to find a competing response-- be good to get a competing response. So I'm just gonna step back for a minute. So what I would do with you through a container top is work on problem solving. Okay? And ideas to work on problem solving. But the chain was useful cuz we've found out what the problems are which are being tired, working late, being tired, the stimulus of the grocery store and the power of the reinforcer which is more powerful than there is not to do it at the moment. Okay? All right. So because we're almost done, I am done, I think. Ah, so what's your, what your feeling about that? What's your-- what was your experience with me doing this? 

00:57:55
MARY Uhm, well, I experience you as being very warm. 

00:57:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:55
MARY And gentle and caring. So you know, I think, yeah, everything that you're doing after that was sort of, ah, well, that-- those are the things I mostly noticed. 

00:58:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Give it... 

00:58:05
MARY And you were pro-- solving a problem too. 

00:58:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you think it might be helpful? 

00:58:10
MARY Yeah. 

00:58:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. The other options to cite this not so important stop and give yourself a break and just do it. 

00:58:15
MARY Oh, no. I want long life. 

00:58:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You want long life, okay? 

00:58:20
MARY Yeah. 

00:58:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So listen, uhm, are you gonna, are you gonna put one of this problem solving into effect? 

00:58:25
MARY Uhm, yeah, I could to chop it other times. There really isn't, ah, ever anything we need so badly that I have to pick it up at 10:30 night. Usually, you know, my husband and I have had some conversations so the really essential stuff is in the house. 

00:58:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. So in other words, part of this is that you know if you go to the grocery store you'll be able to get it. 

00:58:40
MARY Yeah. 

00:58:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So if you just decide that you're gonna make a room, you don't go to the grocery store at night at 10:30? You'd probably get passed that? 

00:58:50
MARY Yeah. 

00:58:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So send me an email if you do that. 

00:58:55
MARY Okay. 

00:58:55
MARSHA LINEHAN You don't have to do that. Okay. Thank you so much. 

00:58:55
MARY All right. Thank you. 

00:58:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Okay. I just wanna say something to everybody in the room, okay? I have to give another talk in 10 minutes at a very far... 

00:59:10
