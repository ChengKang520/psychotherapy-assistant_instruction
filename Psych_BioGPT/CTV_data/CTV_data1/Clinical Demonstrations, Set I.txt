Clinical Demonstrations Set / Jeffrey Zeig, Ph.D 

00:00:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so our purpose here is to do a clinical demonstration and that's kind of similar to therapy. But it's a demonstration and it's not therapy, because there's no ongoing relationship and we're just going to work with somebody for one hour, but not a roleplay, a real situation. We want something where you can experience how different speakers, different members of the faculty might approach clinical situations. So I'm going to ask for a volunteer, and somebody who wants to work on something that is- and solve something that is troubling to them. And, uh, probably in this case, ask for something that's like a habit problem. Something that can be worked on in, uh, the time that we have. Now I'd ask you to be conscious of the fact that there could be some personal disclosure, and that we are webcasting, and we're also video recording for posterity, so we try not to have much personal disclosure, which is why I would suggest something that was simple, like a habit problem, like somebody who wants to get over schizophrenia or something like that. And because we're- we're webcasting, this would be a really good time to turn your cell phone to silent, and remember to do that for all of the different demonstrations and all of the meeting rooms, of course. So what's traditional for me is to ask for a number of volunteers, because what we do is we track the evolution of the psychotherapist. You- you could watch video demonstrations of me from 198- uh, from the early 1980s through today and we keep this archive at the Erickson Foundation, which is wonderful material for some young researcher who would like to really do a- a qualitative study of how a therapist can evolve, so we have videos of me and Gilligan and Rossi and Steven Langdon, and we see the development of therapists over- over many years. So, what I'd like to do is because we have done so many demonstrations about different topics that I try to choose somebody to work with, with a problem that I haven't worked with before, that we don't already have a demonstration for. So, um, I would just ask a few people, and then if I don't select you please, it's just a matter of deciding what kind of demonstration would be good in consideration of the history of demonstrations that we've done. And sometimes we involve the audience and ask the audience to help, so I know, um, we'll have a couple of hands, and please, who's got something that they want to solve? Yes, ma'am, what is it that you'd like to solve? 

00:03:20
JOANNE I've just been diagnosed with (inaudible ) arthritis-type condition. 

00:03:25
JEFFREY ZEIG An arthritis? 

00:03:25
JOANNE Yeah. (inaudible ) 

00:03:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So it's more of a pain? 

00:03:35
JOANNE All over my body, and when it hits- 

00:03:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And what you want to accomplish is more comfort? 

00:03:40
JOANNE What I want to accomplish is, I think part of my problem is that I have a tendency to push myself- 

00:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Too far. 

00:03:45
JOANNE Than I should. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG I got it. 

00:03:50
JOANNE All my life and I'd like to slow it down 

00:03:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. That's a possibility. Also a possibility would be working with Dr. Rossi because of his mind/body approach and he might be able to help- be helpful in other areas, but, uh, I will- That's- What you're saying is pushing yourself too much in consideration of having a chronic condition and so that may be something that we can work on. Somebody else? I understand. Yeah? In the back? 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Um, I have a - 

00:04:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, now I can't hear. That's- that's impossible. You'd have to move closer for me to hear. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN May I ask whoever wants to volunteer to go to the mic? (inaudible ) So that Jeff doesn't have to repeat everything you say. 

00:04:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And we have nobody with a simple habit problem, like stopping smoking, or stopping- no? Okay. So, what happens? You gave up? 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN It's not that simple, I (inaudible )- 

00:04:58
JEFFREY ZEIG No, I, it's okay. It's okay. Anybody else, while we're waiting? Yes? You did, you did a great, a great demonstration. Who did you demonstrate with? You did stopping smoking, with Gilligan, it was a wonderful demonstration. If you have a chance to look at that demonstration, it's really fabulous. Okay. So. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN I may have misunderstood you. I didn't realize it specifically had to be a habit. 

00:05:25
JEFFREY ZEIG No, no it doesn't. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY ZEIG It was about finding somebody. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay I have extreme, uh, airport issues. 

00:05:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Airport issues? 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN Like, with control and despite the fact that I'm a professional and almost every time I go in the airport I nearly get arrested. Because of the control issues. 

00:05:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. I worked with so- with a lot of anxiety issues, so- 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN What's that? I didn't hear you, I'm sorry. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG I've worked with a lot of anxiety issues for doing demonstrations so I think- 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN It's not anxiety. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh no. 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN It's- no. 

00:06:05
JEFFREY ZEIG It is. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN It's not anxiety. 

00:06:05
JEFFREY ZEIG No? 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN It's- no. 

00:06:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Oh, you're telling me that it's anxiety? 

00:06:10
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know. I was taking my best guess. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN It's, it's aggression. It's- 

00:06:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Aggression. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's- I- When people are controlling my things, and not responding to me respectfully and- it's just not, like an interaction that I have with anybody else in my life. 

00:06:35
JEFFREY ZEIG You become a little bit pixelated with these people. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Pretty much. If you call nearly getting arrested every time you go in the airport- I guess, if that's pixelated, sure. 

00:06:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And you could, uh, enquire about, why are they doing things that are so pixelating to you. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN That's what I'm asking you. You're the expert. I just woke up. 

00:07:00
JEFFREY ZEIG That's their job, they're being paid $15 an hour for that. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:07:05
JEFFREY ZEIG But if you pixelated them back a little bit you might feel a little discharge of some of that pent-up energy that's been pixelating to you before. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:07:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay let's take one more and then decide. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Um, I can't seem to, um, conquer my photograph, uh, clutter. 

00:07:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Clutter. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN I'm very neat and clean but the photographs are accumulating, tons and boxes full and I can't get started. 

00:07:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN And anxiety keeps building as I see the boxes and I do nothing about it. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, let me think for just one minute here. So, they're all three interesting problems, I'm just going through my archive of things that I've worked with before and trying to make some decision. You know, I think- 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN One more thing. 

00:08:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Because- because this medical issue is so pressing, and that there's something that is, uh, to be said for being the first person to volunteer. I think that I'll do that, because it must be a vexation to you to be dealing with that chronic medical issue. So please excuse me and let's, let's have you come up on stage. And thank you so much for volunteering and can we express our appreciation? And we're going to hook you up with this microphone and we'll worry about the signing afterwards. So that we just don't have to take time for that. Hey, are you right-eared, or left eared? 

00:08:50
JOANNE Ooh, I don't know. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So. So you'll- yep. Yep. 

00:08:55
JOANNE There we go. 

00:08:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And Joanne? 

00:09:00
JOANNE Joanne, yes. 

00:09:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And then you just hook that over your ear. Like glasses. Great. And then if you can put this in your pocket. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And so, what you've explained to me, and we'll need to just record it again, is that you've got this chronic condition. 

00:09:30
JOANNE Yes. 

00:09:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And the chronic condition is an arthritis. 

00:09:30
JOANNE Yes. 

00:09:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And the extent of the arthritis has been considerable. 

00:09:35
JOANNE Yes, and it's an odd thing. I just um, it moves. And that's why I thought at first it was just nothing. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:09:45
GROUP We can't hear! 

00:09:45
JEFFREY ZEIG We need- 

00:09:45
JOANNE Got it turned on? 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Microphone- her microphone. 

00:09:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Mic is turned on, we just need an attendant to work with the sound board. So, we'll just wait a minute and... And we'll just have to do a mic level check. I always set myself for the first demonstration because there's always some issues that need to be resolved and they might as well be resolved with me. Just say Testing one-two-three. 

00:10:15
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. I don't hear anything coming out- 

00:10:20
JEFFREY ZEIG No that's okay, he's at the sound board, just keep on saying Testing- 

00:10:25
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. Testing one-two-three.Testing one-two-three. Testing. 

00:10:35
JEFFREY ZEIG No? 

00:10:35
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. 

00:10:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Nothing there. One-two-three testing. 

00:10:40
JOANNE One-two-three testing. I can hear a little something coming through- Testing one-two-three. 

00:10:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Call the audio-visual people. 

00:10:50
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. Maybe it's the way I've got it in my- 

00:10:55
JEFFREY ZEIG No no no. It's not you. You're- you're- okay. 

00:11:00
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. Testing one-two-three. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY ZEIG No? 

00:11:10
JOANNE No. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Make sure the mic's pushed all the way in. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:20
JOANNE Testing one-two-three. I can't tell whether it's in. 

00:11:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So, uh, while we're sitting here, chatting casually, we can begin to think about what some of the processes would be and how you might set up your assessment. And in a psychological issue, assessment is not necessarily a way of getting a treatment plan, but assessment is intervention. Now if you're doing a medical procedure, then you have a history, physical examination, then you have tests that you do, and once you've collected all of the data,then you formulate a treatment plan and in some way psychotherapy has modeled similarly what we have done in the medical world, except Milton Erickson. And for Erickson especially, and for those people who have been following him, assessment and intervention intermingle, so as you're doing your intervention, you're doing an assessment. As you're doing assessment, assessment becomes an intervention. And so our assessment should be positive, it should be constructive, it should be solution-focused, it should be oriented towards things that people can change and that part of the issue of assessment is to jump into action. And this I'll be talking about tomorrow when I talk about Erickson and Beethoven. When Beethoven did the Fifth Symphony, one of his principles was jump into action. When Erickson worked with somebody, he would say, do the hypnosis in the first part of the session and then in the second part of the session, you can have the discussion. So hypnosis came first and Erickson would often initiate his treatment by doing trance work. Now that is not something that I am easily capable of doing, because I don't have the particular orientation or genius that Erickson had, but more and more as I gather clinical acumen and experience, this idea of jumping into action. The idea is "people come to therapy for experience, they don't come to therapy for information. "Now I wish I could say that I- that I could take credit for that quote, but I can't, because that quote was really Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, a psychoanalyst. She said, patients come to therapy for an experience and not for information, and so when we want to enter into this Ericksonian world we're entering into a world in which we're creating experiences. If we wanted to define psychotherapy, from an Ericksonian perspective, at least according to Jeff Zeig, we would say that psychotherapy is a symbolic drama of change, the imperative of which is living this experience you will be different. So now we have our technician here, we can do Joanne's mic- mic check. We're on, but we just don't have any sound from that mic. So one-two-three testing, Joanne? 

00:14:35
JOANNE One-two-three testing. One-two-three testing. 

00:14:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Now we're getting there. 

00:14:40
JOANNE Are we hearing it? 

00:14:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah we're getting there. 

00:14:40
JOANNE There, something's coming, yeah. 

00:14:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. We're good. Ready? Okay great. 

00:14:50
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:14:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So now, this arthritis and all over, moving, and didn't know what it was at first. 

00:14:55
JOANNE Right. 

00:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And then you got an assessment and found out- what did you learn? 

00:15:00
JOANNE I learned that I have this type of arthritis and one of the things that's helpful in it sometimes is to be able to kind of slow down, relax, do things in a more measured way. 

00:15:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And that feeling of knowing that you can slow down, let your body relax, and suddenly there's this idea that you can do things in a measured way. And measured is like a waltz. Yeah okay. And so then you've been prompting yourself- 

00:15:35
JOANNE Mmhm. 

00:15:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And you've been saying to yourself, Joan, slow down, do things in a more relaxed way, and operate at a waltz. And why is that meaningful? Why is that important to you? 

00:15:55
JOANNE I'd like to get rid of the medication, because that bothers me. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:16:00
JOANNE And, um- 

00:16:00
JEFFREY ZEIG You'd like to decrease or even get rid of the medication. 

00:16:05
JOANNE Right. Well, the odd part is the amount of medication I'm taking is not very much. It's prednisone and I'm only taking three milligrams. 

00:16:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. 

00:16:15
JOANNE And that's just- I've worked my way down from 10 to three. 

00:16:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh, that's the maintenance dose right now. 

00:16:20
JOANNE Yeah. But I just can't seem to get off of that, and I- I'd like to get off of that. Because it- it has some feelings to it that don't work real well. 

00:16:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And your sense is that as you slow down, as you waltz through life, as you take time to just let yourself relax, that you may be able to go off of the prednisone. 

00:16:45
JOANNE Right. 

00:16:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. 

00:16:45
JOANNE But it also feels like, right now in my life, it's really hard to do that. Because I've got- my husband has illnesses, and he's had- we've been working on that for about three years. Now he's doing much better. He's finally on some medication that's doing well, but it feels like, you know, I'm having to do kind of like double duty. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So now somehow you've got to do double duty and there's your husband and he's got his medical challenges- 

00:17:10
JOANNE Yeah. And he's doing better but I've got- somehow I've got to slow, slow this down, and yet- For example, he's lost his eyesight in his left eye. So now he can't drive. So now I'm the driver. So whenever we go somewhere, I have to do the driving, or if he wants to go somewhere, or needs to go somewhere, I have to go with him. And to his medical appointments, you know, it seems like I have to kind of be there because he- And I think also his- his- it has affected him mentally. His- he's- he's had some, um- 

00:17:50
JEFFREY ZEIG It's huge in your life. 

00:17:50
JOANNE Yeah. And so you know, he's functioning pretty well, but he's had to give up his- you know, his work he's been doing, which is fine, it's time to do that, but, um, so we've got all these things. So the slowing down for me seems harder and harder. 

00:18:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And when you started talking about your husband, suddenly it was as if you were at a kazatzka. Do you know what a kazatzka is? 

00:18:15
JOANNE No. 

00:18:15
JEFFREY ZEIG The Russian dance? Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta? 

00:18:20
JOANNE That's it, that's how it feels, yeah. 

00:18:20
JEFFREY ZEIG I remember I was in Kell Hall at Georgia State University, and I was um, a graduate student, and I was moving ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. And I remember that one of my teachers, one of the great psychotherapists of the 20th century, Irma Lee Shepard, a great gestalt psychotherapist. And suddenly she just got my attention and she looked at me meaningfully, and she put her hand on my chest. And she said to me, support yourself with air. And I remember when she said that it was almost was almost a hypnotic flavor, and she said to me, Just support yourself with air. And it was if that moment became a flashbulb memory in my mind. And I could really get that feeling, because she moved closer, she looked at me meaningfully, she was smiling, and so part of the message that you've been giving yourself is that life is a marathon, and not a sprint, and that you want to interiorize and internalize this idea that you can waltz through your days. Right? 

00:19:50
JOANNE Mmhm, 

00:19:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, now you used a metaphor before, when you were coming up on stage, which was about pushing yourself, right? 

00:19:55
JOANNE Mmhm. 

00:19:55
JEFFREY ZEIG So let's say that there was a part of you that had been avidly pushing yourself. Would that be reasonable to say? 

00:20:10
JOANNE Mmhm. 

00:20:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Now if I was talking to somebody from Asia, China, or Japan, and I said to them, point to yourself, then immediately they wouldn't think in any deliberate or intentional way, but immediately they would do this, because in Asia, if you say point to yourself, they may point here, although western people, if they say point to yourself, yeah. We might point there. So if I say to you to immediately, without any thought, where's that part of you been housed, the part of you that's pushed yourself? There. Okay. Well take it for a minute, hold it, and then move it a little quickly and breathlessly, because that's been part of its MO, right? And then what I'd like you to do if it's okay is just hand it to me for a minute. And I've got it. And wow, it's heavy and dense and lively and moving and breathless and meaningful. Because there's these tremendous difficulties and complications with your husband and all of the things that you have to do and want to do in your life, and this has been the part of you that's pushing you. And for a moment I, and if you wanted to join me, you could- we could honor it, because it's had some meaning in pushing you. And Joan, as you look at it- Joanne, as you look at it, what is it that you see? 

00:22:05
JOANNE I see kind of a big space, 

00:22:05
JEFFREY ZEIG A big space. 

00:22:10
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:22:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. 

00:22:10
JOANNE It's big. 

00:22:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Mmhm. And what's the qualities of that space? 

00:22:20
JOANNE It's light in color, yeah it's light in color and it's- It looks like it's movable. 

00:22:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Looks movable? 

00:22:30
JOANNE Mmhm. It looks- It's big, but it- 

00:22:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Big. But movable. 

00:22:35
JOANNE But movable. 

00:22:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And light in color? What color? 

00:22:40
JOANNE Oh, kind of a- Kind of a whitish color, kind of- maybe with a pink tinge to it. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Mmhm. Whitish color with a pink tinge. Mmhm. Can we do something with this for just a minute. Take this- this space and let's have you stand up and come out of your chair. And- 

00:23:05
JOANNE Oops, there it goes. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Just place that in your pocket and we'll be good. 

00:23:05
JOANNE Not much of a pocket. There we go. 

00:23:10
JEFFREY ZEIG That's good. Okay and then what I'd like you to do is take it, hold it, alright, and then move around the back- put it back inside you for a moment. Got it? 

00:23:20
JOANNE Mmhm. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. And then come around the back of the chair this way. And then put your hands on the chair, great, and then I want you to be that part of yourself that has pushed Joanne. And then just physicalize it for a moment and imagine that Joanne is sitting in the chair and you need to drive your husband, you need to do some things in your life. Uh huh, good, right? And get that breathless feeling uh huh and the rhythm that that part is representing and just physicalize it for a minute, as if you're pushing Jo, uh, Joan- Joanne? Joan? 

00:24:10
JOANNE Joanne. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Joanne. Joanne. As if you're pushing Joanne. Uh huh. Yeah. Keep doing it, and then perhaps you could exaggerate it a little bit, as if you're really pushing her. Mmhm. And then be that part that's been pushing Joanne. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And what can we call you? Can we call you Mrs. P for the moment, because you've been pushing her? Mrs. P, is that all right? 

00:25:00
JOANNE Yeah, uh huh. 

00:25:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Just to make things a little quicker. Mrs. P, you've been pushing Joanne, and I know that you're big and that you're light, and that you're movable, and you've been pushing her. I know that you didn't come in here with the intent of being involved in the demonstration, but Joanne has expressed this desire to make some changes in her life, and to also do things that have a different rhythm and that have a different pace, and that make life into more of a marathon. But you've been there, and you've been pushing at her, and what's the story? What's your message to Joanne and what words would you give to those actions? 

00:25:55
JOANNE Well it's uncomfortable. For me to push her. 

00:26:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh yeah. You don't want to push her? 

00:26:05
JOANNE No, no. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY ZEIG But you've been pushing her. 

00:26:05
JOANNE I know. But it feels uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. 

00:26:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Well help me to understand what- what's your discomfort? Could you just sat that to her, I'm uncomfortable pushing you? 

00:26:20
JOANNE Yeah, it seems so unnecessary, really. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. 

00:26:25
JOANNE You know, it's- And you should be at the place in your life now where you're slowing down instead of speeding up. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So say that back to her. You can be in a place in your life where you're slowing down. 

00:26:40
JOANNE You can be in a place in your life where you're slowing down. 

00:26:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. 

00:26:45
JOANNE Slowing down. 

00:26:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And have you attended any of the hypnosis courses? 

00:26:50
JOANNE Uh huh. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Alright, okay. So look down at her as if you were speaking to her hypnotically and find a few ways to say that suggestion to her again. You can- 

00:27:05
JOANNE You can slow down. You can learn to waltz. You can- 

00:27:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Realize that life is a marathon. 

00:27:15
JOANNE That life's a marathon not a sprint, and um, Yeah and you're- you'd be helping- I think you'd be helping Joe too. I think in some ways I don't think I'm helping him by pushing. Even though I'm trying not to push too hard. 

00:27:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And you really want to. And what would be a waltz? What waltz do you like? Do you have one in mind? 

00:27:50
JOANNE Blue Danube, how's that? 

00:27:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Could you- because sometimes people respond better to sounds than they do to the lovely hypnotic words that you are saying to her, could you do a few bars of Blue Danube? 

00:28:05
JOANNE I don't think so. 

00:28:10
JEFFREY ZEIG But fortunately, we have an audience. 

00:28:10
JOANNE Oh that would be good. 

00:28:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Who do we have that could help us with Blue Danube? La-da-da- 

00:28:25
[music] 

00:28:30
JEFFREY ZEIG This is the enthusiastic audience. Okay one- two- three- 

00:28:40
[music] 

00:29:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. Thank you. Uh huh. Come here. And uh, they're going to do that again, and this time what I'd like you to do is to just face them, so that you can feel their concern and you can feel their warmth and that you can sense the sentiment of all of these people here, and they're supporting you. And that they can add to your accountability. I'll help with that in a minute. 

00:29:55
JOANNE Okay. 

00:29:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay? So, uh huh, just scan the audience, all of these people who are looking at you, concerned and interested. Many of them smiling. Right? And if you wouldn't mind in helping, just to increase the amount of impact that we can- that we can have, let's stand up. And because we can stand up, we don't just need to use our voice, and we can use our gestures, and that our voice can be complimented by those gestures, so that we can hypnotically reinforce that sense of the waltz and the sense of the support that it represents. Okay? So use any gesture that you want. Ready? One, two, three. 

00:30:55
[music] 

00:31:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Breathe it in. [music]Really breathe it in. 

00:31:25
[music] 

00:31:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And now you can take a deep breath and close your eyes and listen and really hear it one more time. Okay? 

00:31:50
[music] 

00:31:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Breathe it in. 

00:32:00
[music] 

00:32:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. And where did that just take you? 

00:32:45
JOANNE Well it was very restful. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Very restful. 

00:32:45
JOANNE Very restful. Like taking a nap, you know? 

00:32:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Uh huh. 

00:32:55
JOANNE And the motion, the one that struck me was this back and forth motion, which I hadn't- I hadn't thought of that until- 

00:33:05
JEFFREY ZEIG This is the gentle swaying- 

00:33:05
JOANNE That back and forth. Back and forth. 

00:33:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And that back and forth motion would be like how you would hold a baby. 

00:33:10
JOANNE Yes that's right. 

00:33:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And how you would honor the child, and how you would nurture it. 

00:33:15
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:33:20
JEFFREY ZEIG How you would care for it. 

00:33:20
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:33:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. Yeah. 

00:33:20
JOANNE Maybe that's what I need to do is nurture myself more. 

00:33:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Maybe? 

00:33:30
JOANNE Maybe. 

00:33:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And why is it that you know- so suspending any objection for a moment- why is it that you know that you can nurture yourself, that you can change the rhythms of life, why is it that you know that you can rest back, why is it that you know that you can interiorize this realization. Life is a marathon. Why do you know that? 

00:34:10
JOANNE I don't know, it just seems true. 

00:34:15
JEFFREY ZEIG It is true. What do you know about yourself? 

00:34:20
JOANNE I've been sprinting a lot. In my lifetime. 

00:34:20
JEFFREY ZEIG What do you know about yourself that lets you know that you can do that? 

00:34:25
JOANNE That I can relax. Because I have had times that I can do that. 

00:34:30
JEFFREY ZEIG That's right. 

00:34:30
JOANNE I know I can do that. 

00:34:30
JEFFREY ZEIG That's right. 

00:34:35
JOANNE In fact it feels really good. 

00:34:35
JEFFREY ZEIG That's right. And what is it that you know about you? That you're intelligent, that you're strong, that you're creative, that you're motivated? 

00:34:45
JOANNE Yes, all of those. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY ZEIG All of those things. And also you know that you have a goal in mind. Something that's really important for you to accomplish. 

00:34:55
JOANNE That's right. 

00:34:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? 

00:34:55
JOANNE Yes. 

00:34:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Why else is it- why else is it that you know that you can do this? Because it's meaningful- how? It's meaningful that you do this? 

00:35:10
JOANNE I just think that I'd get more done, to be truthful. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And, uh huh. 

00:35:15
JOANNE I mean, it- it just seems now when you sprint, um, that's too tiring. It's just exhausting. 

00:35:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So I don't remember who that was, it wasn't the Beach Boys, but it was sometimes you get there faster by taking it slow. 

00:35:30
JOANNE Yeah. 

00:35:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Who was that? Kokomo? Yep, uh huh. 

00:35:40
JOANNE Yeah. I know- I know that. 

00:35:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And you know that. 

00:35:45
JOANNE I do know that. 

00:35:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And the important thing is that you realize that. 

00:35:50
JOANNE I give myself permission to do that. 

00:35:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh, uh huh. And would it be all right for you to give yourself permission to have a more- even more deeply entrancing moment? 

00:36:00
JOANNE Sure. 

00:36:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And then how would you begin to orient yourself differently? So that you could take that easy breath, you could allow yourself to sit back, you could allow your arms to rest back so that you would take any pressure off of your shoulders, and then you could begin by just focusing for a moment on how that moment at which you exhale fully, that moment in which you really exhale fully, that's the moment of most profound physiological comfort. And it could be that just sitting back is a way that you orient yourself, so that time begins to change. And I don't know just how your perception of time- 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Your perception of time can be realized now differently. And how there can be a memorable and enduring sense, and how you can realize and appreciate that memorable and enduring sense and the way in which the rhythms of motion can change. And how there can be pleasant thoughts, little baby thoughts, that begin to start in your inner mind, and begin to nurture, nurture the experience of developing those rhythms of comfort, those rhythms of peace and tranquility. Those rhythms of relaxation that we call trance. And you really don't need to pay attention to the way in which you unconsciously turned your right ear toward me. Probably your dominant ear. You don't need to notice that there could be those fluttery feelings around your eyelids. You don't need to pay attention to the support and how your body- that's right, supports itself. And how, in the air, there can be that sense of real warmth. Sometimes people come to me for consultations from the world of sports, athletics, and I had a - a man come to me, and he was a semi-professional boxer and hew as coming because he had some circumscribed concern that he wanted to solve in his life, and I asked him to think, and take time and in a meditative state, in a positive way, to really think and really feel and realize- of course I can accomplish this. Because I'm intelligent and motivated and wise and strong and while he was meditating on those things, I asked him, I said, How is it that when you're in the boxing ring, you can perform so well? And the explanation was, Time slows down. And being curious, I wondered how was it that that could be accomplished. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And the answer was, once the pressure of being involved is there, then suddenly there's that different rhythm, there's that difference where suddenly, time slows down and, as he explained to me, there's so much time to act and react, and to be able to understand how to take those steps, to be able to understand. This is about protection. To be able to realize this is a tool to protect the body. And to get the real felt sense time just slows down, and there's a very pleasant different rhythm of caring. Now I really don't know how he did that, if suddenly when the pressure of performing was there, that suddenly he could realize. You want to do the best that you can and really protect the important interests. And truthfully Joanne, I don't know how you can understand my words, how you can listen to my words. How you can begin to realize and memorize some of those important words, just like as a girl, you may have learned to ride a bicycle. And without consciously deliberating, you don't have to think about, this is how you keep your balance. There's just that moment in which suddenly this is something that you memorize in your body. And that once you practice a little bit and you try a little bit, suddenly you have that sense of balance. And that's something that you don't learn in your brain. This is something that you get a felt sense, and once you get that felt sense of balance, there's the realization that you can really go far. 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:45:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And there's that realization that the distance that you can travel increases. Because you've got that felt sense that is effortless and something that you realize in the body of your experience. And of course you think about it in your mind, but it's that moment in which you really get it in your body. And you feel that sense of balance, unconsciously. That you can suddenly experience the pride of knowing that the distance that you can travel so much greater. And in this meditative state, this very pleasant state of sitting back and enjoying and being comfortable, you're capable of just quietly taking some time to yourself. And I would invite you to take some time for yourself to view and review some of the things that we've been doing and talking about. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And in just a few moments of actual time, it could feel to you in doing that review that you have all of the time in the world. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And I really don't know, and you really don't know just how you can use these realizations, how you can use this new sense of balance, and how you can continue to nurture those realizations. Recognizing, to your own delight, that you can experience those realizations at work. Inside you. That you can envision, envision those rhythms sounding so musically, ringing true inside your mind, inside your body, inside the spirit of your experience so that you can envision yourself really being at home with those rhythms, those realizations. Continuing to nurture them inside. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And in your own mind, you can continue, continue to envision, envision that sense of balance, those rhythms, evolving. As you nurture them, nurture them in relationship. To the capacity of your own inner mind to guide you. 

00:49:50
[sil.] 

00:50:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And I was just remembering this moment, one of those other reference experiences that was a personal revelation, that I could share with you. I was studying for my doctoral degree in Atlanta, Georgia and I was taking some friends to an evening event. And I had a little Volkswagen, there were four of us in the car and I was driving and trying to get there, get there, get there, get there, and got caught by a light. And I remember, we were stopped in front of Piedmont Park and the wind was blowing in the trees, and I was trying to get there, get there, get there, and I must have thumped on the steering wheel and my friend Janice, who was sitting in the back of the car, in her lovely Southern drawl, said, What a beautiful time, what a, what a beautiful time for a rest. 

00:51:25
[sil.] 

00:51:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Now that was so curious, because that was so so many years ago, and even to this day there has never been a moment where I've been stopped in traffic and been the slightest bit pixellated. As if somewhere I have interiorized the realization without any conscious realization what a beautiful time for a rest. And Joanne, I'd like you to begin to bring yourself back and to recognize that you can bring yourself back here. Reoriented and completely reoriented and pleasantly reoriented, as straight ahead you can begin to orient yourself fully by here now, now here, and completely here now, taking one or two or three easy breaths, just take one or two or three easy breaths and then begin to reorient yourself and bring yourself back completely, fully rested, refreshed, energized. Hi, how was that? 

00:53:05
JOANNE It was very good. 

00:53:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Very good. What was very good about it? 

00:53:05
JOANNE Well the part about the Volkswagen just brought a memory back to me. Years ago I was going to school in Dallas, Texas and heading home I had about a two hour drive or a three hour drive home from there and it was raining. And I had a Volkswagen, a little Volkswagen bug, I was driving. And I got caught on the freeway by two big semis, went by and just engulfed me with water. I couldn't see anything and it really scared me. I was just terrified, and I looked up, and there was a, i think it used to be a Howard Johnson motel or something, and I saw that sign, and I just hit the next exit and I went and checked in there, and called my husband, and said, I'm not coming home tonight, I'm gonna stay here, and it was the most- 

00:54:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And you took care of yourself. 

00:54:05
JOANNE And it was the most restful thing I did, because I was really scared, and life went on and I was- 

00:54:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Beautiful memory. 

00:54:15
JOANNE Yes. Yes. 

00:54:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh. 

00:54:15
JOANNE And that's maybe what I need to do more of. 

00:54:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Maybe. 

00:54:20
JOANNE Maybe taking care. 

00:54:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh huh, and you felt that without any conscious deliberation that as soon as you came out of the trance the sense of movement and the sense of rhythm- Uh huh. 

00:54:35
JOANNE Uh huh, it was all right there, yeah. 

00:54:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It was right there, it was right there for you. 

00:54:35
JOANNE Yeah. Yes, it was. 

00:54:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. I'd like to thank you very much. 

00:54:45
JOANNE Thank you. Thank you very much. 

00:54:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And thanks for helping. 

00:54:50
JOANNE But thank the audience mostly for getting me out of having to remember how to do the Blue Danube Waltz, but let's see, there you go. But when it came, it came in good. Yes. 

00:55:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's stop here because we need to set up for the next session and thanks so much for coming. 

00:55:10
JOANNE Well thank you. 

00:55:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Thanks so much for supporting the foundation. 

00:55:10
JOANNE Yeah, thank you. 

00:55:10
Michael Yapko, Ph D 

00:55:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Welcome everybody. Let's go ahead and get this demonstration hour underway. Thank you all for coming on this early Saturday morning. I appreciate it. I'm Michael Yapko. Before I begin, I would like to encourage you to turn off your cell phone, because it's really important that you turn off your cell phone. And in case I forgot to mention it, it would be really helpful if you would turn off your cell phone. Um, I'm trying to remember the last time I did a presentation where somebody's phone didn't go off, and I th- the best that I can recollect was it was 1951, so I'd like to see if we can duplicate that this morning. Um, the title of the demonstration was 'Hypnosis as a Catalyst for Taking the Next Growthful Step' and one of the things that has always impressed me about hypnosis and continues to impress me about hypnosis is the fact that hypnosis creates this context, this atmosphere, both intrapersonally and interpersonally that allows people to connect with their own resources that's the most compelling reason of course for wanting to do hypnosis in the first place. But the things that people struggle with, the challenges that they face so often they get stuck in a moment, in a sense, and that moment, unfortunately, can last for decades. Where people can lose sight of what the next step is and where the next step is taking them, and so often you don't really necessarily know what the next step is as much as you want there to be a next step, and you find yourself taking a course of action that leads you someplace that you don't even necessarily even know where it's going to go, but it's movement. And the ability to respond to that movement spontaneously, the ability to utilize the feedback from the environment around you as you move yourself to new arenas, to me is what I mean by a growthful next step. You know, it's great on one hand to be very deliberate to have a plan, have a structure, know exactly what you're doing and follow it, and that's great. I love the idea of being able to be linear and be able to be planful, organized in the way that you approach things, but the reality is that so much of life can't be planned, and requires the ability to respond spontaneously and what it takes to do that well, is enough self-trust that you can reach inside yourself and pull out the salient resources that help you handle this situation skillfully. And for me, so often people talk about the importance of good self-esteem and actually I think self-esteem has been overrated as a construct, but where the self-esteem building comes in is when you move through your day, move through the things that you have to face, and when you're looking at what you've done, and how you've responded, to be able to say to yourself, I like the way I handled that. I like the way I responded to that. And that is what becomes growthful, as you discover more of your own resources. And so what I hope to be able to demonstrate in this hypnosis session is the value of hypnosis in connecting people to resources and then thinking in terms of what is the next growthful step and can I take it with that greater sense of confidence that I have resources to that I can use to handle things in ways that really make me do feel good about the way that I handled things. Now I came into this demonstration hour not having anyone predetermined to be my partner in this process, but as I was standing up here waiting for the time to begin, Babette came up to me and said, do you have anybody? I said no, she volunteered herself, and so Babette's going to be my partner, so if you would welcome Babette to the stage. Come on up. 

01:00:45
[sil.] 

01:00:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Now this is your microphone, that goes behind your ear. That's good. And then I don't know where you're going to want to put that. You wanna just- yeah, you can just hold it, or you can kind of tuck it by your side and let's turn it on. There's a button up top here. Alright. 

01:01:15
BABETTE Okay. 

01:01:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi Babette. 

01:01:15
BABETTE Hi. 

01:01:20
MICHAEL YAPKO What would you like help with? 

01:01:20
BABETTE I dunno. 

01:01:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Did you say you don't know? 

01:01:25
BABETTE I don't know. 

01:01:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Alright. That makes it easy. 

01:01:30
BABETTE Okay good. 

01:01:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Um, tell me a little bit about yourself. 

01:01:35
BABETTE Um- 

01:01:35
UNKNOWN Can't hear. A little bit louder! 

01:01:40
BABETTE Can't hear me? Um, well I'm a little nervous right now. Being up here. Um, I'm from Florida, Um- 

01:01:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Could we turn up the volume on the microphones any? And if you move it a little bit closer to your mouth it might help too- yeah, it's on kind of a wire that you can bend. 

01:02:00
BABETTE Okay, is that better? 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN A lot better! 

01:02:05
BABETTE Okay. I have a very soft voice. 

01:02:05
MICHAEL YAPKO There we go. 

01:02:05
BABETTE Okay. Is that okay? Okay. 

01:02:10
MICHAEL YAPKO I've got it as close to my mouth as I can get it. 

01:02:15
BABETTE I know. If you hold it it's probably easier but okay. Alright. 

01:02:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Go ahead. 

01:02:25
BABETTE Um, so I'm from Florida, and um, I came to this conference because I'm very interested in hypnosis and I'm um, writing my dissertation for my PhD as we speak and um, I have my youngest child leaving for college next year, and what else? In clinical practice, I have my own practice, um, and I don't know what else to tell you. 

01:03:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Has hypnosis been a part of your work before? 

01:03:00
BABETTE Yes it has. 

01:03:05
MICHAEL YAPKO What exactly do you do? 

01:03:05
BABETTE Um, I use hypnosis, um, oftentimes with isolated peers, and I feel comfortable using hypnosis but, um, I would definitely like to learn more. I've learned a lot so far here. 

01:03:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. Alright. And so in volunteering to come up here you didn't really have anything particular in mind, apparently. 

01:03:30
BABETTE True. 

01:03:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And is that still the case? 

01:03:35
BABETTE Um, well as I was thinking about it, I feel this, writing my dissertation and moving on to the next phase which will be, um, completing my dissertation is a large step, and I'm nervous about the process and going through it. I'm hopeful to get through it and um, then to have my PhD and kind of what the next step after that is. 

01:04:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you already have specific plans in place or is this going to be kind of a discover as you go sort of thing? 

01:04:20
BABETTE Uh, discover as I go. 

01:04:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And is that typical for you? 

01:04:25
BABETTE That's very typical of me. 

01:04:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Kind of wing your way through life. 

01:04:35
BABETTE Yes, just like coming up here. 

01:04:35
MICHAEL YAPKO And how's it been going? 

01:04:40
BABETTE Very good so far. 

01:04:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You can trust your winging, huh? 

01:04:40
BABETTE Yes, yeah I kind of fly by the seat of my pants. 

01:04:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But somehow it works out? 

01:04:45
BABETTE Yeah, it works out well. 

01:04:45
MICHAEL YAPKO How? 

01:04:50
BABETTE Um, I go with my gut, and um, I don't plan, um, because a lot of times if I plan I have a tendency to worry to much, so when I take on things I just do it cause it feels like it's the right thing to do. And I think a lot of people in my life think that that doesn't make a lot of sense and they don't understand that but it works for me. 

01:05:15
MICHAEL YAPKO How does it work for you? How is it that you know somehow in your gut that this is a gut feeling that you can follow? 

01:05:25
BABETTE Um, I don't, I don't know if I know for sure if it's the right thing to follow. Um, something tells me to do it. Something compels me to do it. 

01:05:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Are there times when you have this gut feeling and you don't listen to it? 

01:05:50
BABETTE Um, not so often. More often I listen to it. And I was going to say that some of it's based in competition, and wanting to succeed. And, um, I keep pushing myself to do better, to do more. I have done a lot of triathlons, a lot of competitive sports, so- And I feel like my dissertation now is part of- is similar to running a, or doing a triathlon. Just getting into it, just doing it and getting it done, and then once you get it done it's gonna be incredible, hopefully. 

01:06:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. And in terms of your own experience with hypnosis, this is, as your said, part of your practice. 

01:06:50
BABETTE Mmhm. 

01:06:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Is it also something that you do with yourself at all? 

01:06:55
BABETTE Uh, I took a hypnosis course, uh, with Douglas Flemings, uh, last year, and um, I did a lot of self-meditation and I found it to be very helpful because I have migraine headaches, and when I was doing it on a regular basis my migraines diminished significantly, but I don't do it very often because I'm writing my dissertation and so that is what I do during all my free time right now. Yeah. 

01:07:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Well then it might be a really nice time for you to just be able to take this break. 

01:07:35
BABETTE I agree. 

01:07:35
MICHAEL YAPKO So I would encourage you to do what you know how to do. 

01:07:35
BABETTE Okay. 

01:07:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Orient yourself in whatever way. 

01:07:40
BABETTE Okay. 

01:07:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Given that you're as experienced as you are, you already know something then about what it's like to be able to start to narrow your focus. That's right. Whether you focus on your breathing, whether you focus on my voice, whether you focus on the comfort of the chair. In a way it really doesn't even matter what you focus on at the beginning. Because all you're really doing is challenging yourself and at the same time supporting yourself to be able to create an experience and co-create an experience that's useful to you in some way. Now it's interesting that you've lived by this ability to use your gut as an indicator of what to do. And I really don't know what it was that rose up from within you to motivate you to want to volunteer yourself for this experience. But it's certainly my intention to validate the correctness of that gut feeling. Because there's a lot that I can say to you. Things that will remind you of things you already know. It's always interesting how things that we know recede into the background. easy to forget about them until you have an experience that reminds you of what you know that's valuable. And of course there are also things that I can talk about, things that might introduce a slightly different perspective. Or perhaps, a lack of perspective. But here at the outside as your focus continues to build, as your breathing slows just as it has been, as your thoughts grow more focused. 

01:11:35
[sil.] 

01:11:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And yet at the same time thoughts going in different directions, easy to appreciate the merits of saying that you can listen to me, but you don't need to listen to me. 

01:12:05
[sil.] 

01:12:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Now here's a situation where you can acknowledge that you really didn't have a goal in mind, and yet at the same time you were willing to experience just being here. And here you are. And you really don't know just what I'm going to say. You really don't know what points I'm going to raise. You really don't know how immediately relevant this will be. And the fact that you could be here in this way not knowing demonstrates something quite extraordinary. It says quite a lot about your ability, to walk into a situation that is by its very nature ambiguous and uncertain. And even though you don't know what's going to happen, you trust yourself to be able to handle it, to be able to respond to it, in a way that's meaningful, sensible, more than that, in a way that's effective. Now I've spent so much of my professional life studying people who are prone to particular disorders, like anxiety, depression, and they have such an entirely different response to ambiguity. Something that's well-documented in clinical literature. The virtual antithesis of your willingness to experiment. Your willingness to challenge yourself. And this might be your first formal hypnosis experience today, first stage of the hypnosis triathlon. Only the unusual hardiness. Here's a context in which speed doesn't matter and nobody's keeping track of your time. Now you know and I know that there are lots of people who enter triathlons, not necessarily because they want to win as much as they want to improve their own time, and that's the marker that they use to know that they're getting stronger, more skillful, competing against themselves. Now that's a curious phrase, competing against yourself. But I would guess it's one that you understand quite well. Because when you can acknowledge having a competitive nature. Is there anything more powerful than someone who's on a mission? The power of drive that keeps you moving form one step to the next. And it didn't escape my notice the value of drive that radiates from you and motivates your child to want to go off to college. What a great gift to have given, the seed of desire to keep growing and keep learning and what an extraordinary next step in your child's life. And that didn't arise in a vacuum. It's something that you've modeled, that unique blend of following your gut and having a plan. Now I'm all for spontaneity, but I really like the idea of sometimes planning to be spontaneous. And just allowing the next step to unfold, knowing that there is that underlying drive, ambition, counter-balanced by a willingness to experiment and a willingness to discover what's possible. 

01:20:50
[sil.] 

01:20:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And given the phase that you're in right now, academically, working on the dissertation, and anyone can appreciate exactly what you meant when you said every spare minute and it's a curious thing. There are some people that will complete all of their coursework but can't seem to get to the dissertation. I'm sure you've hear the phrase A-B-D enough times in your life and it's a curious thing because what it speaks to, Babette, is how people deal with structure, or the absence of structure. When class is scheduled and it starts on a certain day at a certain time. All students really have to do is show up and look reasonably alert. It's structured for them, when the paper is due. It's structured for them when the midterm will be. It's structured for them when the final will be. And as long as you keep one foot moving in front of the other pretty good chance you'll get through the class. But then you come to this phase where there isn't a structure imposed on you. It's a structure you create for yourself. And you're doing that and it isn't easy but you're doing that. Now you know and I know that this is a temporary phase in your life. There's a very low probability that you'll be 67 and still working on your dissertation. And moving through any temporary phase means coming out the other side of it having something. It was that way in having a child. A 15-month pregnancy just wasn't part of the deal. There's an end point and you had something to show for it. And still have something to show for it. And once that PhD is yours no one can take it away. It's like the time in your last triathlon, no one can take it away. And how you get from here to there and how when you get there you remember being here. And what it's like to hear what you need to hear here to get there. It's all part of that fluid process of moving, always moving. And of course, focus changes, interest fluctuates, dedication wavers, nothing unusual about that. There aren't many mornings when you're going to wake up and say, today I feel like editing. And the real challenge is how to keep moving, how to take another step, even when you're not particularly in the mood today. 

01:27:35
[sil.] 

01:27:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And that is a capacity you've already demonstrated, just being here this morning, Babette. To hear you say at the beginning that you felt nervous, well that seems a long time ago now, but to still be here and to be able to absorb highlights one very important thing. Sometimes our guts can be wonderful purveyors of the truth. And sometimes our guts can easily lead to a misstep. And what you've learned without really realizing you've learned it is that you're really good at listening to your gut, but you're also good at knowing what the next step is and what the relationship between the two really is. 

01:29:15
[sil.] 

01:29:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Because when you wake up and you don't say, Today I feel like editing, and you're still able to move forward, there's the value of a competitive spirit that wants to finish the race. A little tired, maybe even a little shaky, but nothing that a little Gatorade and a few hours of rest won't fix. And something really good to eat. That reminds you that part's over and on to the next thing. Now I've been talking about a lit of different things, Babette, and I really have no way of knowing what you've been focused on and absorbed in during this time and so in just a moment I'd like to be able to check in with you and so I'm going to ask you, without disturbing your focus any, still being comfortable, still being absorbed, if you can describe out loud for me what you're aware of. 

01:31:30
BABETTE Um. I feel like I'm going to finish my dissertation and feel very proud of the fact that I finished my dissertation. Um, I think sometimes I am worried that I won't finish it, but I feel like now I can and I also feel like a lot of change is happening, and that I- that I didn't realize before. So I'm going to be really sad when my daughter leaves for college. And it will be right about the time when I get my PhD. 

01:32:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Mmhm. And proud too. 

01:32:30
BABETTE Yeah. 

01:32:30
MICHAEL YAPKO For her next step. 

01:32:30
BABETTE Yeah. 

01:32:35
MICHAEL YAPKO And how she'll feel about your next step. 

01:32:35
BABETTE Yeah. 

01:32:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And a curious thing to be on parallel tracks together. 

01:32:45
BABETTE Yeah. 

01:32:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And isn't that always the way? How each step forward? 

01:32:55
BABETTE Yeah and I didn't plan that either. 

01:32:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

01:32:55
BABETTE It just happened that way. 

01:33:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It just happened that way. 

01:33:00
BABETTE It did. 

01:33:00
MICHAEL YAPKO But isn't it true that every step forward means leaving something behind? 

01:33:10
BABETTE Yeah. 

01:33:10
MICHAEL YAPKO But embracing something new. 

01:33:10
BABETTE Yes. 

01:33:15
MICHAEL YAPKO And to hear you say that now you know you can finish, even those mornings when you wake up and say, today I don't feel like it. As you're walking into your office and turning on the computer and moving onto the next and the next and the next, but instead of being A-B-D, you'll be B-A-D, which is kinda cool, don't you think? 

01:34:00
BABETTE Mmhm. This is really, um, I feel like this is the biggest accomplishment that I've achieved. 

01:34:10
MICHAEL YAPKO The biggest one so far. 

01:34:15
BABETTE Yeah, exactly, so far. Because it was hard. 

01:34:20
MICHAEL YAPKO You look like you've got a few good years left. 

01:34:25
BABETTE Thank you. I almost- I almost feel like this is taking so much out of me to get through this, while raising kids and working and practice and just keeping life going. It's like, what's on the other end of this? 

01:34:50
MICHAEL YAPKO But you know there's going to be times where you're doing hypnosis sessions with your clients and what you're going to discover then is how much it's put into you to be able to talk about with authority and experience. 

01:35:05
BABETTE Mmhm. 

01:35:10
MICHAEL YAPKO So it's not unlike the triathlon where it takes a lot out of you and puts how much back, when you're talking about it later. 

01:35:20
BABETTE The triathlons are easy. 

01:35:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Much- much more temporary aren't they? 

01:35:25
BABETTE Yeah- they- it was not, it was not like this. This is very tedious. I enjoyed working for the triathlons because it was, um, I like, I like the physical, the physicality of exercising, movement, but the- writing the dissertation is not- it's just tedious work. 

01:36:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It's exercising a different part of you. From discipline to neurogenesis to being able to address the cosmic question of what the hell am I doing? 

01:36:20
[sil.] 

01:36:25
MICHAEL YAPKO So as you settle back in and make yourself even more comfortable now, I can certainly take a minute or two to review so much. You can take a minute or two to review so much of what this session's been about and how it went from volunteering with no specific idea in mind to reaching this point of having a certainty. That's invaluable. About yourself, your style of movement through life. What it means to go from A-B-D to B-A-D, to PhD and what it means to have given so much only to discover how much you have left that you just hadn't noticed before. So what you'll bring back with you when I ask you to reorient in just a moment, I really can't predict exactly, but I can certainly say in a general way, there's a lot that you've had to opportunity to discover and reconnect with. And each time that you do hypnosis or self-hypnosis, there's that wonderful self-acknowledgment, not in an arrogant or grandiose way, just a real solid sense of who you are and what you bring. Take whatever time you'd like to, Babette, process your thoughts, feelings, reactions, to assimilate at the deepest levels within you the implications, the understandings, and then when you feel like you've had enough time to do that, you can slowly start the process of gradually reorienting yourself at a rate that's comfortable, easy. Here's one context for you, just not in any hurry. But you can take your time. And when you feel like you're ready to and want to, you can reorient yourself completely, let your eyes open whenever you're ready. Whenever you're ready. 

01:40:05
[sil.] 

01:40:10
BABETTE Hi. 

01:40:15
MICHAEL YAPKO How are you doing? 

01:40:15
BABETTE Good. 

01:40:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Good. Interested in any comments you have, or observations? 

01:40:25
BABETTE Um, what I noticed- The first thing I noticed was my body, um, I don't think I- I couldn't even swallow at one point, I was so deeply in a trance. And, uh, I couldn't feel my body, so- it was a nice feeling. So that was, that was- 

01:40:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Did you experience that quality of dissociation before? 

01:41:00
BABETTE No, not like that. So it was- 

01:41:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice to discover you can do that, isn't it? 

01:41:05
BABETTE Yeah, it was amazing. Because at first my hands were, um, I thought well maybe I need to relax them, but then I noticed I didn't have to do anything. They were just relaxed, so I didn't have to move them or anything like that. 

01:41:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Right. 

01:41:20
BABETTE So, um, then I kind of felt like I'm taking too much time here to- for everybody's- maybe we need to like speed this along so I was feeling nervous that I was taking too much of your time. 

01:41:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Well I appreciate that but I think you can appreciate the kinds of things that you're dealing with are things that everybody relates to. You know, what happens when you have these burdens of things you need to work through in one way or another I think everybody in here can relate to that so in that respect I was actually grateful that we were able to address something that had such widespread appeal. So, I thank you. 

01:42:05
BABETTE Thank you. I, um, I didn't realize also that my daughter leaving is a very big change in my life. I've had a lot of emotions about that. 

01:42:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

01:42:20
BABETTE And I didn't have that with my other daughter leaving so I think that it's just the change of her leaving and... 

01:42:25
MICHAEL YAPKO It's a big step. 

01:42:25
BABETTE Big step. And, um, then also finishing and moving forward it seems like everything that you said to me, um, makes perfect sense, and when you were telling me about editing and having to wake up in the morning and I remember I went from being depressed. When I first started writing, now I'm- it's almost humorous. And I get up and I do two or three hours and I am seeing it differently how I have to view this process and um, when I look at it differently then it becomes less overwhelming. 

01:43:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

01:43:20
BABETTE I could see the steps and I understood how you related it to being in the triathlon, except to me they're still different. Because, um, the triathlons were like, I couldn't wait to do it. This is like I just can't wait for it to be over. 

01:43:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. Understandably. 

01:43:50
BABETTE You know like when I got to the starting point on the triathlon I was like a horse ready to go. Now I feel like when I go in to present, when I'm finally done, I hope that I'll be, you know, all of that energy and excitement but I don't know. 

01:44:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. Do we have any time? We do. Would you be willing to respond to questions from the audience about your experience? 

01:44:20
BABETTE Sure. Absolutely. 

01:44:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. If there are any questions, please go to the microphone in the aisleway. If you have any questions for Babette about your experience or if you have any questions for me about the process itself. We've got just a few minutes to be able to do that, and then I want to be able to make a summary comment before we go our separate ways. Are there any questions or comments? 

01:44:50
BABETTE There was a question back there. 

01:44:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Please come to the microphone. 

01:44:55
[sil.] 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN This is not a question as much as it is a statement that I'd like to share. I'm kind of short and this is tall. Um, I came in here. I have a structural problem, I have a bio-mechanical issue. I have scoliosis and as I've gotten older it's progressed and sitting all day yesterday was torturous. I put a brace on last night, I stretched, I did all sorts of things and I came in here really aching, and with your induction of the trance I allowed myself to be taken over by it. And I just have to report that the pain is gone. So I was really in agony, I'm sitting back there stretching so even though you directed at her and there's certain things that I could- that I resonated with, I fly by the seat of my pants too. And uh, I'm also an artist so I'll be making decisions and choices on an unconscious level all the time. But the power of what you did and the way you did it enabled, and I'm sure other people here experienced it too. By allowing it to be, and being with it as one. And I really thank you and thank you Babette for allowing this to happen. 

01:46:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you so much, appreciate that a lot. 

01:46:35
[sil.] 

01:46:40
UNKNOWN Hello. 

01:46:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi. 

01:46:40
UNKNOWN Everybody can you hear me? Okay, I made some observations about this whole process that have really helped me. One is that you can use humor, and that doesn't break it, it kind of loosens it up a little bit more, I think. And um, another thing is using- Michael, you used the word 'my', 'I'. You know and also some of the words like 'don't', you know and the negative. I guess I just had this idea that there are certain words, things you don't do in hypnosis and I see it really is just more conversational. 

01:47:25
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, responding to the humor part of it. You know the person you're talking to has feelings, and you know, when you're dealing with somebody who has a sense of humor as Babette obviously does, why not utilize that? And in terms of language, there are all kinds of words that we have that are triggers for all kinds of experiences and I like using all of them. But having to be careful- if you go back and you look at times I used don't this, I'm actually using that to create the other kind of experience. If you don't wait til you feel like editing, you know, that kind of thing. Where I'm really talking about, here's an opportunity to filter your feelings out of the equation, so. 

01:48:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:48:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. 

01:48:25
UNKNOWN I heard how you started this whole session off, I'm just curious how you got to where the goal was, in 20 words or less. Of this session. And that's your words. 

01:48:40
MICHAEL YAPKO When I asked Babette about, when I said please tell me a little bit about yourself, when she said that she likes to run triathlons, she's working on her dissertation, you know, whether she uses these words or not, clearly she's in a transition phase right now where things are on the verge of some pretty big changes. She's just responding to that, that these changes are going to happen, you're not going to know exactly where they're going to take you, so in 20 words or less I wanted to talk about her ability to handle ambiguity, evidenced by her willingness to even come up here and do this, so handling ambiguity skilfully was one theme that I wanted to address. And related to that, being able to know yourself and your resources well enough to know that as these changes happen you'll be able to use these resources to move through these things, and also then as a third thing that being able to say to her, gut feelings are one thing, but gut feelings don't preclude having an ability to plan. So there's where I kind of played with a little bit and said spontaneity is a good thing but there's also value in planning to be spontaneous at times. But it was really just responding to the fact that she's in transition and let's talk about what's next. 

01:50:05
BABETTE And I liked the link between planning, um, and doing things spontaneously, because oftentimes I have a judgment that I am too spontaneous, so it, um, helped me to make that connection as well as the ambiguity, because I felt like it was okay to come up here and just do what I did and what I do, um, so it- that relaxed me right away. Made me feel like whatever I was doing was- was okay. 

01:50:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:50:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, Babette, I want to say thank you to you by giving you a copy of my brand new book, Mindful and Hypnosis. I appreciate that. You know, I think it takes a lot of courage to come up here and be willing to share with people, share yourself and- and, uh, I thank you so much. It was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for coming everybody.

Bill O'Hanlon, MS 

01:51:40
BILL O'HANLON So, I'm Bill O'Hanlon, welcome here. And, um, we, this is a clinical demonstration on solution-oriented hypnosis, and I'll tell you just a couple of things, and then we'll meet Laurie and we'll do some work together. Um, I'll tell you just a couple of things about this process, and why I call it solution-oriented hypnosis. I was trained by Milton Erickson, I was his gardener when I was in graduate school. I could not afford to pay him, and he kindly allowed me to be his gardener, a work-study student, basically, and um, I think I was his only work-study student. One time that I was in graduate school in the middle of the year, I was studying with him, he said, Do you of your fellow graduate students want to come out and study with me? And I said, Oh yes, I've told them all about you, they'd really like to study. He said, do any of them have any money? I said, No. That was the last we heard of that. I think he could only afford to take one of us on and so- he did need to pay the rent, um, so being with Erickson and studying with Erickson warped me for the rest of my natural, clinical days, and one of the things that warped me was this idea that was quite radical for me at the time. Now seems pretty sensible and for some of you will seem sensible but was extremely radical when I studied with him, which was in 1977. Um, this idea that everything that people had going on with them, even their problems and symptoms, were potentially resources and skills and strengths and abilities. And the first case I ever came across when I first met him in 1973 at the university in which I work, um, was this case where this woman's suicidal, she hates herself, thinks she's ugly, and she's very isolated and he has her practice- again, she wants to kill herself- he has her practice getting mouthfuls of water and squirting it through this gap in her teeth that she thinks is one of her most disfiguring qualities of her body, you know, aspects of her body. And this is her assignment for the first while. Ultimately he uses that gap in her teeth to get her to flirt with a guy at work and squirt water through that gap in her teeth, shoot like a squirt gun, and he chases after her and gives her a kiss, and they start to go out on dates, and it's like, what the hell? They're not teaching me this in psychology school, when someone comes in suicidal and hates themselves and has low self-esteem and body dysmorphic disorder you get them to squirt water through the gap in their teeth, this is how you treat them? It was so weird, the kind of way of Erickson had of transforming what people thought were liabilities into assets so that inspired me for my whole life, in my therapy career and I began to- some of you know the other story that really was the keystone story for me of creating a kind of therapy called solution-oriented therapy, that I heard this story from Dr. Erickson when I was studying with him about the African violet queen, which I think most of you know, but basically another suicidal woman, depressed, who grew African violets, who was very isolated but religious in her past, and he suggests he takes- once he finds out about this, that she takes the African violets, re-pot them into gift pots, and bring them out to people in the religious community with congratulations, condolences, depending what they're going through in their lives, and it transforms their life. When she dies, they can't fit the people in the church that want to come to their memorial service. So she went from this isolated person to this well-connected, not-depressed person because of these African violets. So just finding the resources and solutions within the person's eco-system, internally or externally, was the shift for me. Because, like most of you, when I was trained as a psychotherapist, I was trained to go like a heat-seeking missile for what's wrong with people, for their pathology, for where they were damaged, what their symptoms are, what their diagnosis is, so when I went to do hypnosis there were two things that came out of this for hypnosis. One is that I didn't love the traditional kind of hypnosis, I found it a little creepy and manipulative, you know, you will go into trance. The guy with the really deep eyes and the goatee who's, you know, tries to make you do things. That freaked me out, I didn't want anything to do with that hypnosis, but when I saw and heard what Dr. Erickson was doing, which was I think, you know, this is a controversial thing to say in a hypnosis workshop and seminar, but I think hypnosis has nothing to do with suggestion. Now that may be a weird thing for you to hear, because you're sure hypnosis has to do with suggestion. I think it has to do with evocation. That is, I think, you know, political leaders can get people to do things without putting them in trance. And they don't use hypnosis as- although some do- bad hypnosis. But um, often, but I think that what Dr. Erickson was doing, what he taught me to do was evoke abilities and resources, memories, skills, sensations, from the inside rather than to add new ideas from the outside, which is more of the suggestive approach. Every way and every day, things are getting better and better. You'll enjoy more and more being a non-smoker. That was not typically what he did, and that is not what I do. So that is not what you'll see here. We're gonna evoke abilities, capabilities, and they're going to be the African violets in people's lives, or the gap in the teeth. It's either going to be something they saw as a liability, an experience as a liability into an asset, or it's going to be some other resource, applied to this liability situation to resolve it. So that's my big rap, took five minutes to tell you the entire history of what I've thought about and written 35 books about the last 30 years. Alright, so. Here we are. So Laurie, tell me a little about the background- we're just going to focus right in on this thing that you would like to change. You told me the two minute, the one minute version, so tell me when did this happen, how did this happen, what happened, where did you get stuck, and where would you like to go? In 25 words or less. 

01:58:15
LAURIE So, um, I obtained a spider bite on my leg. This is actually a medical issue, three years ago, um, November was three years and... 

01:58:25
BILL O'HANLON And usually these things clear up on their own. They're bad and maybe they have to excise some tissue but they clear up and they go away? 

01:58:35
LAURIE Yeah. 

01:58:35
BILL O'HANLON And three years, it hasn't? 

01:58:40
LAURIE It hasn't and I never did see the spider but because of the duration of my symptoms and the duration of this problem, I'm guessing that it was a really bad spider, or maybe a brown recluse, and as I've been doing a little bit of research about what happens to people when they get bitten with a really bad spider like that. Many people have surgeries, they, um, can lose limbs, god forbid, um, it has the potential of being really serious. So I'm thinking there's a possibility that that's what happened to me, because this is three years later, um, I'm very thankful that I haven't had any of those problems, I think there's certain reasons why I haven't. 

01:59:20
BILL O'HANLON Wait wait wait, don't gloss over that. So there's certain reasons why you haven't? What are those? Why do you think that those might be? Why didn't you- why didn't, why wasn't it worse I guess? I mean, it's been bad, but why wasn't it worse? Why didn't you die? Why didn't you have- I'm curious. 

01:59:40
LAURIE Mostly I think, um, nutritionally I've been doing some things holistically, um, that are very potent, that have supported the rest of my body. 

01:59:55
BILL O'HANLON Right, so you're generally healthy and you were before this spider bite too, You kind of took care of yourself, you ate pretty well, you exercised? So you maybe were in better shape to get something like this happen to you, but you've been even more mindful of that and made some changes since then to support your healing, and things like that? 

02:00:15
LAURIE Mmhm. 

02:00:15
BILL O'HANLON Okay, so that's one reason, anything else, you think? That- why it wasn't worse, or why, you know, even though it hasn't entirely healed or gone away, why you did better than maybe other people that you've read about? 

02:00:30
LAURIE I don't know. Luck. 

02:00:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. Okay. And so, you went right away to doctors, or you didn't know it was quite so serious at first? 

02:00:45
LAURIE I kinda dismissed it at first, um, it was one of those events that, um, when it happened, it happened at night, in the middle of the night in my bed. I was bitten by something, didn't know what it was. Felt a pinch, scratched, went back to sleep, forgot about it until the next morning when I saw that it was a holy mess on my leg, um, probably from my scratching. But again, I just kind of dismissed it, you know, took care of it superficially, thinking it would go away like any other bite that I'd sustained in my life. Um, and actually it was here, on the inside of my ankle and apparently that's a poor circulation area. 

02:01:20
BILL O'HANLON Ah. 

02:01:25
LAURIE It takes a long time to heal for anybody, I've found that out since then. So I really continued to ignore it, just took care of it superficially, and the wound healed, but it didn't look quite right, and then I was actually playing volleyball one night, which is something that I did regularly for many many years, and there was an EMT who was my friend there that night, and he said to me, what the hell is that? You really need to take care of that, it does not look normal, and that was about two months later. So then at that point I got a little freaked and, um, I started all the doctor appointments, including a dermatologist, a vascular surgeon, the head of surgery at Inglewood Hospital in New Jersey. Um, multiple dermatologists, internists, rheumatologists, I pretty much hit the hit parade looking for help following through with any recommendations that people gave me. Most often they would give me a recommendation, I would try it, things would either stay the same or get worse. I'd go back to them and then they'd say, Time, you need time. But doing nothing actually made things worse, and doing things that they told me either kept things the same or made them, made them worse. And since that time I found out that I'm a highly allergic person. Um, I didn't know that, but that my skin apparently, you know, is very sensitive, and especially at a time like that you become hyper-reactive systemically, is what I was told. So that's why every single treatment, every bandage, which I needed to use bandages, every cream, every- you know, thing made it worse. 

02:03:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. I was just talking to Reed Wilson, who is a specialist in anxiety and panic stuff, and we were talking about how people want to get panic and anxiety, they try things that sometimes make things worse. These were medical people that were telling you, try things and although they were sensible things, in your situation they either didn't help or made things a bit worse. Now, you know, you just mentioned one more thing to me as we were talking before you came up, and that is not that much has made it better. It hasn't gotten that much better over time. It stayed about the same or gotten a little worse, is that right? 

02:03:45
LAURIE Well, over the last three years, it has made significant improvements. 

02:03:50
BILL O'HANLON That's good. 

02:03:50
LAURIE I started to see, um, some doctors at NYU Medical Center, who were specialists in skin and cancer-type things, um, because I was told that they were really, you know, tremendous experts. They did have me move a long way, um. It's obviously not an open wound anymore, it's a closed wound, it really has come a long way, when I show it to my family and people that had seen it, but it's still there. Inflammation is still- not the bite, necessarily, but the inflammation is still there. 

02:04:20
BILL O'HANLON Alright. You mentioned that sometimes it gets, it's gotten a little worse, with stress or anxiety. I mean, there are, there are things that are you know, have an influence on your immune response, your allergic response, your life, that probably can inflame it a little, or make it a little worse, is that right? 

02:04:45
LAURIE Yes. 

02:04:45
BILL O'HANLON And, and what is that like? I mean, you just, you just see it more? You just feel it more, it's painful, it's itchy? What? What? 

02:04:55
LAURIE Well I guess the most marked example I could give you is, there was one day that I was having a very upsetting conversation with somebody, and it was a conversation that needed to be had and in the end it was resolved and everything was fine. It was something that was weighing on me for a very long time and I was anxious about having that conversation. And before- 

02:05:20
BILL O'HANLON You didn't listen to me. Please turn off your cell phones or put them on the (inaudible ). Sorry about that. Sorry to interrupt you. Go ahead. So you were having that conversation and it was? That was a hard conversation to have, you've been anxious about it, it went okay. But during that time or afterwards? 

02:05:40
LAURIE So before the conversation I was wearing shorts at the time, and I noticed my leg looked really pretty much the way it had been. After the conversation I- it was amazing to me to notice that I had blisters. 

02:05:50
BILL O'HANLON Ah ha. 

02:05:50
LAURIE On part of my leg. 

02:05:55
BILL O'HANLON Wow. 

02:05:55
LAURIE And I actually showed it to the person I was speaking to, and I said, This is how upset this issue is making me. 

02:06:05
BILL O'HANLON Yes. 

02:06:05
LAURIE Look. I didn't do that for guilt purposes- 

02:06:10
BILL O'HANLON You weren't guilting them, you were just saying I want you to witness, this was a hard thing for me to do. 

02:06:15
LAURIE That and the conversation was about motivation to move forward on something that affected me. 

02:06:20
BILL O'HANLON Right. Yeah. 

02:06:25
LAURIE And so I guess I was trying to say. 

02:06:25
BILL O'HANLON It's having an effect on you. 

02:06:25
LAURIE Right. 

02:06:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:06:25
LAURIE Um, and so I've noticed sometimes that I break out in that area, you know, after a flight. I'm a little bit nervous getting on a plane. 

02:06:35
BILL O'HANLON Ah. 

02:06:35
LAURIE Um, and you know, during other times. 

02:06:40
BILL O'HANLON So there- so just to summarize this, there are things that if, you know, if you knew that there was something you were anxious about, you could probably make this a little worse. You know, the wound or the situation a little worse on your leg, and- but you can't think of anything particularly to- that's under your influence to make it better? Is that right, or is that not right? 

02:07:05
LAURIE Um- 

02:07:05
BILL O'HANLON Calm down and not be anxious, not have a lot of stress in your life, you know, which is a more general thing, but you can't- you haven't come up with anything that much except time and you saw some of these people and followed the recommendations to make it heal all the way, basically. 

02:07:20
LAURIE I think hypnosis helps, as a result of this- 

02:07:25
BILL O'HANLON Ah! 

02:07:25
LAURIE And the doctors at NYU telling me that I was going to have this problem for at least another year, so, um, a little over a year ago I sought some therapy, with a psychologist in New Jersey who does hypnosis. Um, because people had told me that it could really be helpful for dermatology issues. 

02:07:40
BILL O'HANLON Yes. 

02:07:40
LAURIE And that's actually how I got involved in the training for hypnosis. 

02:07:45
BILL O'HANLON Wow. 

02:07:45
LAURIE And, and my practice, it was a good thing, but- 

02:07:50
BILL O'HANLON The wounded healer, I've heard that story. Good, um. So, you know, it's interesting that you say this because I teach hypnosis a fair amount and what I say to people is, as a therapist, I never treated warts before I knew hypnosis. But somebody came to me and said that I have intractable warts, they keep recurring, and my dermatologist has done everything that he has to do, and it was in a cold clime, and she said, one day I just went out after like the 27th treatment when he froze them off, burned them up, it was freezing, I put my hands on the steering wheel and I just broke down and cried. Like it's just, you know, so uncomfortable and painful. And went back in his office and I was crying in the waiting room, and they called him and they sent me back to an office, and said, Don't you know anything else? He said, Well I just read in a dermatology journal that intractable warts, persistent warts, hypnosis sometimes helps. He said, I don't know anybody who does it and I think it's quackery and everything. She said, well I know someone who does it. She was a therapist and she'd been to one of my therapy workshops. She said I know someone who does it. And she came in and she said Yes? And I thought, well I've never treated warts but I'll give it a try, you know. Because Erickson did, and I learned how he did it, you know and so they got better. And I was like, I would- you know, and the only thing I would have done is say, have less stress in your life, before that. But I think there's a more direct treatment for this with hypnosis, so I agree. It's good. A good direction. Alright, and so you've made some progress with that and you really like, I mean if you got up from here and you went off into your life or even went and sat down and it cleared up- this was a past issue for you, there was no more residuals for this, that would be the ideal outcome. That would be great. 

02:09:35
LAURIE I'd cancel my appointment for NYU that I have scheduled in January. 

02:09:40
BILL O'HANLON Alright, alright! We're going for it then, you know? Who knows when whether we'll get there, but, I'm going for that. I'll save you a lot of money on your copay. 

02:09:45
LAURIE Oh, it's a $40 copay, it's killing me. 

02:09:45
BILL O'HANLON Right, yeah. Alright, good, so anything else I need to know before you go into trance? 

02:09:55
LAURIE Um, much like many people here I suppose, my life is pretty stressful, um, just in an ordinary kind of way. Nothing traumatic. I am working pretty full hours, I come home late, um, I just started a private practice in the spring. My clients that I deal with at work four days a week and for the last 20 years, since I got licensed, have been very difficult, treatment resistant, um, so work itself, I'm realizing now is really a stress, even though I take it for granted that I'm used to it. 

02:10:30
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:10:35
LAURIE Um, now at the practice I work at night too, so I go straight from work to the practice. Very often I come home at 10:00 at night. I have three kids, I'm married. I feel like I'm not spending enough time with them. The goal of the practice was to eventually have that time and schedule it, you know, the way that I could- 

02:10:55
BILL O'HANLON A little more time flexibility in things and still with the same kind of income and all that stuff. 

02:10:55
LAURIE Right. So now I'm barely seeing my kids and my family, um, when I'm not- when I'm not at the practice at night, now my kids are ages that I have, you know, games to go to. Two basket- two sets of basketball games and hockey games, and so that's my choice. I like going to those things, um, but I'm exhausted. 

02:11:20
BILL O'HANLON Flat-out with that stuff. Yeah. 

02:11:20
LAURIE And I work Fridays, and then I work Sundays sometimes, so. 

02:11:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. It's a busy life. A stressful life, like most people. Let's just say, that's the story I hear from most people. Good. Okay. So I got that. Anything else particular before you go into the trance part of this? 

02:11:40
LAURIE Um, I would like to be able to deal better with stress and anxiety, um, there was a demonstration earlier today which really resonated with me about slowing down. It was somebody who really had a lot of responsibility and a lot to do, and one of the purposes of the, of the demonstration was to, um, slow down, take things slower. I feel like that really relates to me. Lots to do. Um, I would like to be able to accomplish it all, but slow down internally. 

02:12:10
BILL O'HANLON Okay. Okay. Good. Alright, that's helpful. Alright. Okay, so you've been in trance a few times at least and maybe even a number of times before, yeah? 

02:12:20
LAURIE Yeah. 

02:12:20
BILL O'HANLON Okay, and you're pretty comfortable with that? 

02:12:25
LAURIE Mmhm. 

02:12:25
BILL O'HANLON Okay, good. So what I'll say in this particular setting, especially since, you know, we're up here in front of people and you know, there's this, there's that. There's no right way or wrong way to respond to this. So I just want to take the pressure off as much as I can up here, as much as I can because we still have little minds who will say, Well, I should do this, or I'm supposed to do this right or whatever, but as much as possible if you have one of those thoughts, just let that thought be there and let it go. I- you know, you don't have to worry about making me look good. I'll work on that. Um, and uh, yeah yeah. So you just have whatever experience you have. It doesn't have to be good, right, or anything like that. That's the first kind of stuff. And then the next thing I'll say is just, yeah, just let yourself tune in to where you are right now. And be where you are right now. Again, not trying to think anything particular, or do anything in particular, or make anything happen. Just letting yourself be exactly where you are. And you can keep your eyes open if that's what's appropriate, or you can close your eyes. Or you might not actually make a decision about that, they make just open or close on their own. And then just start that process that you know how to do, of going into the kind of trance that's appropriate for this situation. Only as deeply as you need to go to get the results that you want. And as deeply as you need to go to get the results that you need. 

02:14:20
[sil.] 

02:14:25
BILL O'HANLON And as you go just to the place that's right for you... 

02:14:30
[sil.] 

02:14:35
BILL O'HANLON Define what's necessary, what's needed inside. 

02:14:40
[sil.] 

02:14:45
BILL O'HANLON You might notice those things. That's right, that usually happen for you in trance. Or you might not. 

02:15:05
[sil.] 

02:15:10
BILL O'HANLON For me what usually happens is I start to feel something different with my hands. They get a little more still. And then often they start to feel a little detached. 

02:15:35
[sil.] 

02:15:40
BILL O'HANLON Or maybe a little numb in some way. So you must have something similar for you, a kind of a signal, that lets you know you're going more deeply into that inner focus state. That state of trance. 

02:16:00
[sil.] 

02:16:05
BILL O'HANLON And one of the things about the unconscious, if you want to call it that, the non-conscious mind, is that once it gets good at doing something, like driving... 

02:16:25
[sil.] 

02:16:30
BILL O'HANLON You can do it pretty automatically. If you learn touch typing your fingers know how to do it. If you play an instrument, or play a sport, your body knows how to do that automatically. And I think it's somewhat similar with trance. Once you learn to go into trance, in the ways that you do, you can find your way back there. In your own way, automatically. At your own rate and your own pace. And some people experience that little automatic movements of the fingers or the hands, in trance, if that's something you will do or have done. That could be something that's part of your trance. And really that's just an indicator. That you're into that place where the body's responding with some automatic responses. And that's what we're looking for in this situation. That your body has a mind of its own in a certain way. We want to use that body mind to help you come up with ways to heal completely. It is amazing what the body can heal probably that we don't even know that it's healed. 

02:18:35
[sil.] 

02:18:40
BILL O'HANLON And that somehow some way, the cells in the body have a certain wisdom. 

02:18:55
[sil.] 

02:19:00
BILL O'HANLON And the body chemistry has a certain wisdom that help you go to sleep when you need to go to sleep, feel hungry when you need to ear, and it gives signals when you need to make adjustments. And you learn to trust those, as the years go on. That they'll just operate automatically so it's often a shock when they don't operate automatically, as you expect. 

02:19:45
[sil.] 

02:19:50
BILL O'HANLON One of Erickson's students who was an influence on me was a guy named John Weakland. John Weakland was a brief therapist, and he told me one time- he had a wry sense of humor- he told me one time, The first rule of brief therapy is to go slowly, which I really appreciate. So what I'd say to you is that you can take all the inner time that you need to do the healing that you need to do in this situation. And that inner time is different from clock time. And it might be the same in your everyday life. When things are feeling rushed. It could be like those moments that people talk about during crises or disasters when everything just slows down. And you have all the time in the world. There's a stillness in the middle of the franticness, the chaos, the busyness, where you can find that still point in the center. And when you're centered, you can operate from that place. In a calm, clear way. 

02:21:25
[sil.] 

02:21:30
BILL O'HANLON And you'd really like healing to take place. And you actually have the faith that healing can take place, as do I. That there's an ability of the body to heal. 

02:21:55
[sil.] 

02:22:00
BILL O'HANLON Years ago, when I was seeing Bill Moyers interview Joseph Campbell on public television, he asked him, What if I student came to you and said, What should I do with my life? Joseph Campbell answered without hesitation, I would tell them to follow their bliss. Because if you follow your bliss, eventually everything in life works out. But it was sort of a hippy time, and some people took that as, indulge themselves and just follow what feels good. And while that was sort of the meaning that Campbell had, he felt he'd been misunderstood. He said sometimes you have to wrestle with your demons inside You have to go to really dark places, tough places to come out the other side. And it's not always just what tastes good in the moment or feels good in the moment. It's what deeply, soulfully satisfy for you, is what he meant. He said, Maybe I should revise it and say Follow your blisters. So I was thinking of that when you were telling me about those blisters showing up. And here's a possibility, that I think occurs at that point. I'll tell you a little story first and maybe you'll understand the possibility better. I had a guy come to see me who had neuropathy in his feet. This unexplained pain, they couldn't treat medically. They'd done everything they could for him. And he told me that it was interfering with his sleep, because it occurred at 9:00 every night. And he would get these shooting pains in his feet, and they stopped him from going to sleep. He tried going to sleep at 8:30 to kind of outsmart it, get ahead of it, but at 9:00 it would wake him up. So he wasn't getting much sleep as well as he had this severe discomfort. So he did some hypnosis and he came back a couple weeks later and he said- I said, well, anything to report? he said, nothing's changed. I said, so you're still having trouble sleeping, and you're still getting the pain at 9:00 every night? He said, Oh, no no no no, I'm sleeping fine. But the pain's coming at 9:00 every morning. I said, that seems like a big change to me. And once we spoke about it, he said, he agreed that it was a big change. It had been very consistently 9:00 at night for a long time, and I said, As long as we can get some change, that's what I'm looking for. Ultimately, of course, I'd like you to feel comfortable. And that's what I'd suggest to you. That there's a possibility that we could start to make arrangements with your body and with you non-conscious mind to, as you're healing, to start to make some differences, some noticeable differences in the location, the timing, the sensation. it could be a tingling where there wasn't, that kind of tingling sensation that was another sensation before. It could be a numbness, or if there was numbness, it could be some pleasant sensation. It could be a change slightly in the location, as it works its way through and out, through the immune system, through the body. It could be something else that you wouldn't have thought of consciously, and I wouldn't think of consciously or rationally, that gives you a signal like when you were in that conversation and you got that signal about your stress or anxiety level. But the signal could change in some way, so that you could take the stress off that part of your body and let that part of your body heal completely, sort of give it a rest. Or it could be something else changes that neither of us expect. That's the nice part about hypnosis. That the body has a repertoire of skills and abilities. When you were younger, and you got a knee scrape or an elbow scrape, or a little cut, your body knew exactly how to heal that without you running the show consciously or deliberately. It sends the right blood cells, changes the blood vessels, changes the skin chemistry, something changes automatically. This whole orchestrated series of changes. And your body has that ability. And the nice part about going into trance is that it's like we go to possibility-land, where new things can occur, in new ways. And that's because our neurology is changeable, it's plastic. That neural plasticity, the brain plasticity we've been hearing about in the last few years is one of the hallmarks of our survival on this planet. That humans and cockroaches can live in a lot of environments. We're very adaptable. We can live in the hottest climates and the coldest climates. We go under the sea, and into the air. We have a lot of adaptability. We can learn various languages. As we're immersed in different environments, our brains change, our neurology changes. Someone who came from a hundred years ago wouldn't be able to live the kind of life you're living for a while. It would be overwhelming, with the traffic and learning to drive, learning to use cell phones or all the other modern conveniences, but if they were here long enough and it didn't destroy them, they would adapt, eventually. They would learn, eventually. They would change eventually. 

02:29:45
[sil.] 

02:29:50
BILL O'HANLON And so this matter of time, when they say to you, the doctors, that you'll just have to wait, healing occurs with time. Again the thing I think about hypnosis is that time is plastic too. When you're waiting for something you really want to have happen it seems like time just slows down. When you're involved in something you're very absorbed in, it seems like time speeds up, or goes away. 

02:30:30
[sil.] 

02:30:35
BILL O'HANLON So time is changing. It would be nice to make arrangements with your body and your non-conscious mind that deeper ability of the body to shift the body clock so that time could be speeded up on the healing that needs to take place. That would have taken a year, could be speeded up like fast-forwarding a videotape, or a DVD, and that could take one tenth the time, one hundredth of the time. 

02:31:30
[sil.] 

02:31:35
BILL O'HANLON So that you can make arrangements with yourself for completely healed, and also make arrangements to get signals for some other aspects of your life, of your body, when it's time to make a change. When you need to deal with something that you haven't dealt with. When you need to shift something in your life so there's less stress or less anxiety. When you need to have the hard conversations. But the necessary conversations. It could be another signal. It could be a tingling in the right earlobe, instead. That it'd be your signal- Oh, there's something I need to deal with. So that there could be a time for that leg, that ankle to rest, to heal completely. And you could have another signal when there's something you need to tend to. That'd be nice. 

02:32:55
[sil.] 

02:33:00
BILL O'HANLON And you really made some efforts to make some shifts in your life, recently. And again, some of those may take time to put in place. 

02:33:15
[sil.] 

02:33:20
BILL O'HANLON And you can find your way in the midst of all that, that's right. To just connect deeply with yourself, in a way that's right for you. I was out to dinner last night, I was talking about some changes I'd made in my life. One of my dinner companions said, so you finally found balance. And I laughed and said No, balance has never appealed to me. I've always liked the notion but I've never really gone for that. What I wanna go for is the things that I want in my life. To have more of those, and less of the things I don't want in my life. I'm not really looking for balance. So I hear that you've been, while you've been dealing with this medical issue, this bodily issue, really making shifts to make sure that there's more of what you want in your life. You're doing more of what you want with the time that you have. In a parallel way, your body could be doing more of what you need, what you want, while you heal. So it could support you in living the life that you want and feeling good in that life. And moving to the place you want to move to. And finally leaving that old stuff behind, the old wound behind. The old trouble behind. I once went to a self-help seminar and they said, Our goal for this seminar is to get you to leave behind all those recurring problems that you've been dealing with again and again in your life. The same ones that pop up again and again. And give you a whole new set of problems. I was really excited about that because I was so bored with those same old issues. I wanted new issues. Even though they're unknown and uncertain I guess that could be a little challenging. I was so tired of dealing with the same damn thing over and over again, in different variations. So I think it's time, in your life, to have new problems. And to leave this old problem behind, so that you can be telling people, months from now or years from now, I used to have this spider bit that didn't heal for a long time. That would be a nice future to move into, live into. And then finally it cleared up. And that actually was parallel to other changes I had made in my life at the time. I just moved to a more comfortable place, a better place in my life. I really don't know how your body heals these things. I really don't know when your body will heal it, and you don't know. 

02:37:10
[sil.] 

02:37:15
BILL O'HANLON But I'll be curious. If we encounter one another again, or if I hear from you to hear how it happened. When it happened. What was surprising about it. What was unexpected about it. What was delightful about it. How it happened. What other changes came along with it. 

02:37:50
[sil.] 

02:38:00
BILL O'HANLON And I think it'd be nice to use your creativity and do it in a way that no one else would do it. Just your way. A way that's just right for you. 

02:38:20
[sil.] 

02:38:30
BILL O'HANLON And now what I'd suggest is that you take again about a minute of clock time, and as much inside time as you need, to complete this particular trance, knowing that things can go on after the trance. At another level, beneath the decks. And that when you're ready to come all the way out, that you start to reorient to the present time, present place. To you and your body, sitting in this chair, right now, on the Sabbath, to come back to yourself, in a sacred way. When you're ready to reorient all the way, to come out of trance, to leave everything behind for trance, that's for trance, and to bring everything out that's for conscious mind to consider. And then when you're ready to come all the way back, you can just open your eyes to come all the way back. That's right, that's good. Okay. Ground control to Laurie. Any reports on that? You don't have to have, but if you do, it'd be interesting. 

02:40:00
LAURIE I'll email you. 

02:40:00
BILL O'HANLON Good. That's fine. Good. Right? And would you mind sitting up here for a few minutes in case there are questions and comments from the peanut gallery about that process? Is that all right? 

02:40:15
LAURIE Can I just say, um, I think you have a couple of really great ideas that I had not considered? Surprise. Um... 

02:40:25
BILL O'HANLON What, I mean, if you could, if you want to speak about them? 

02:40:25
LAURIE Yeah. 

02:40:30
BILL O'HANLON I mean you could, what stood out for you in terms of that? 

02:40:30
LAURIE Just the idea of being told by the medical profession... 

02:40:35
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. 

02:40:35
LAURIE That it will take X amount of time, if not longer. And the idea of internal time, my own healing, that could speed right up, so in hypnosis, to have that healing time go much faster. 

02:40:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, I don't know if you know this weird story of Erickson, but he had this woman that came to him who was having psychotic experiences and she would stay home for three days, living in a crystal cave in the bottom of the ocean, and she'd get fired because she wouldn't show up at work. So Erickson didn't cure the psychosis, he just started a time distortion where she'd do this on her 15-minute break. She could live three days of her psychotic hallucinations in her breaks at work. And she was quite functional at work after that. You know, she did really well. And then, lat- this is the same woman, I don't know, some of you know this case is really weird, as a lot of Erickson cases, a really weird case- she got promoted in her job, and she became an executive assistant to like a mucky-muck at some company. And he was transferred, he wanted to bring her with him, but she was seeing Erickson, and he was kind of keeping her together. He said, that's okay, you can you know,take the transfer, because it was really good transfer and a good career move. She said, what am I going to do with my psychotic experiences? He said, Just put them in a manila envelope and send them to me. So she put them in a manila envelope and sent them to him. What really totally impressed me was that about three years later she came and visited Phoenix again, and she said, I want to see them. And he got them out of his- he had kept them in his filing cabinet. She made sure each one was in there, gave them back to him, and took off. I was like, I love that, you know? That he- that he was so respectful, he kept her psychotic experiences in his filing cabinet in her file. But that is my model to, you know, be not just like, Oh I've got a dull person, she's crazy. It was really a respectful way of saying, this is a way we've worked out to deal with this stuff. So that was my inspiration. I thought, well, time is plastic, it's changing- you know that, I know that, we've all had experience of that. And hypnosis, you get your little hand on the control knob of those kind of automaticities, the time change, and all that kind of stuff. So, okay, good, so that was a great idea, than you. Um, what else? Tell me about another good idea that I had. 

02:42:55
LAURIE Sure. 

02:42:55
BILL O'HANLON All right. 

02:42:55
LAURIE Um, let's see, what was the other one? 

02:43:00
BILL O'HANLON Amnesia. No no, just joking. Just joking. You didn't remember that part? 

02:43:10
LAURIE Now the pressure's on! 

02:43:10
BILL O'HANLON I said to forget everything? Oh ok. 

02:43:10
LAURIE You had like 10 good ideas... 

02:43:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:43:10
LAURIE And now the pressure's on for me to come out with them. 

02:43:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, yeah, yeah, the pressure's on to come up with the 10. We don't have time to go over them all. No, that's fine, if you don't- They'll probably come to you in a minute, but- 

02:43:25
LAURIE Toward the end, uh, maybe it was five minutes clock time, I don't really know, but toward the end when, when there was some kind of shift and, and you said, you were talking about maybe having tingling in my earlobe, or some other sign- 

02:43:40
BILL O'HANLON Oh, right, yeah. 

02:43:40
LAURIE To indicate that I need to shift away fro- away from- 

02:43:45
BILL O'HANLON Deal with stress or anxiety? 

02:43:45
LAURIE Anxiety, right. Um, right at that moment, the color inside my eyelids changed. Um, maybe it didn't change but my perception of it changed. It had been, I guess, maybe like a light light-ish pink color, inside my eyelids and then all the sudden when you said that, it became a dark blue. Which is kind of strange. 

02:44:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:44:10
LAURIE Um, but that was something that I noticed, and then also, tailing along with that, um, another minute or so later, I noticed, um, I started to feel a pulse just throughout my body. My hands were pulsing, not in a bad way, a pleasant way, and pulse throughout my legs, um, just blood, you know, pulsating. 

02:44:35
BILL O'HANLON That's a sign of major healing as far as I know. Nah, just joking. It could be. Could be. Alright, so, again, you willing to answer a few questions for the community- If they have questions for you, or for me, or comments, this is Laurie, I'm Bill. You want to go to the microphone, because they're recording this, and also we wanna hear, you know, we- This big room, we won't be able to hear, so if you have a question or comment. What did you observe? Was it solution-oriented in any sort of way? I hope so because I wasn't attending, I was just attending to Laurie. Ah, but I assume it was solution-oriented. Well, I know, because I remember a couple of things and a couple things you just said. But what did you notice that was solution-oriented, and maybe different from the traditional suggestive hypnosis? Alright, any questions? Go ahead, go to the mic. 

02:45:30
UNKNOWN I noticed the- the piece towards the end was solution-oriented. It seemed to me when you were referring to, and you may notice which maybe pleasant sensations, you know, you may feel or some surprise, surprises in some of the physiolo- physiology and there's a whole range of comments you made around the expectation of the changes as well as the comments about how nice it would be to tell people in the future. 

02:46:05
BILL O'HANLON Ah yeah, that was one of those future-oriented things. 

02:46:05
UNKNOWN Future- future-oriented- 

02:46:05
BILL O'HANLON Future-oriented solution.. 

02:46:10
UNKNOWN What it was like, and so forth, so those were a few things. 

02:46:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, I call that- I call what you, both of those things you talked about more possibility-therapy. I was just opening possibilities and one of them was the possibility for the future, so that's good, great. Thanks. 

02:46:25
UNKNOWN And just one other quick comment which is a little different in terms of a different perspective, uh, additional perspective maybe. Is, you know, these ordeals we go through, why do we go through these ordeals, I heard a spiritual teacher say a number of years ago that, um, this quote, which is, "We gain permanent strength exactly to the extent of the effort required to overcome our difficulties." It really stuck with me and I think there's a lot of truth to that. 

02:46:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:46:50
UNKNOWN So, just putting that out there. 

02:46:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

02:46:55
LAURIE Thank you. 

02:46:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, I, you know, and that's a pretty good idea. I've always said Hunter Thompson was this gonzo journalist who said, "I hate to recommend sex, drugs, and rock and roll but they've always work for me and you know, I have a similar motto that is, I hate to recommend terrible life crises for personal growth, but they've always worked for me. And I agree, but here's the key. You know, I once heard Dominick Dunne become an alcoholic and his daughter was killed and everything and he said, I became an alcoholic- he was talking to Charlie Rose and he said, Charlie, hitting bottom is a wonderful thing, if you can get back up. Now that's the key- can you find a way through or out of that experience and then it can be useful. Otherwise it's just painful and diminishing, I think. That's the tough part. 

02:47:45
LAURIE Can I make one comment about that? I forgot to tell you something and you just reminded me. So I started to see a psychologist a little over a year ago for hypnotherapy on this- this medical issue. And I had been thinking about a private practice for four year- I've been licensed for almost 20 years and I'd been thinking about a private practice really intently, but just was not able to move forward. I had lots of but I can't, but this, but that. And I just have to say that, um, after my second session of hypnotherapy, which the hypnotherapy had nothing to do with a private practice, but walking into his office that second day, I was on the phone with work, and I hung up the phone and I was very irritated and I said, this is bull, at work, I'm tired of dealing with this, I need a private practice. And we sat down for the next 15 minutes and he said to me, Well why don't you have a private practice? And it was 15 minutes of conversation, after which we did updates about my leg and hypnotherapy, and that second session I walked out of the office saying, I am completely ready. Two months later, I had an office space, um, I - I had it going so that was transformational for me. 

02:49:05
BILL O'HANLON Uh-huh, in that sort of way, yeah. Right. Good. Okay. 

02:49:05
UNKNOWN Um, Bill, one of the things that struck me, and you just referred to it actually as I was listening and watching what you did. What came to mind for me was the painting of possibilities, and you mentioned that yourself and how it felt for you and um, but what struck me in particular because that can come into any kind of hypnosis is the possibilities that you painted were not some kind of weird, out of hand, magical thing that can happen. They were very realistic possibilities. They were a lot of different alternatives for healing that uh, were lined with science or just common sense, and I liked the way that you responded to that in saying that, you know, some thing- some of these things haven't occurred to me before. I really liked that aspect of what you did. 

02:49:55
BILL O'HANLON Right, yeah. That's the way I think of it is, it's a smorgasbord and I don't know what's right for you to have at the smorgasbord, you know. You're- I've just laid out this pile- set of possibilities and then something in you responds. Consciously and non-consciously, so that would be what the email would be about, because I'd be really curious what actually shows up in your life from that smorgasbord or painting of possibilities which was another metaphor, so. Okay, anything else before we complete this experience? 

02:50:30
LAURIE Thank you so much. 

02:50:30
BILL O'HANLON Oh, thank you for taking the risk to come up here, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to all of you for coming along and being part of this, and witnessing this and so we're- we'll call it complete, thanks. 

02:50:45
Stephen Gilligan PhD 

02:50:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Welcome. Hi to everybody. And uh, I'm Steve Gilligan, this is Barbara. Barbara, do you want to mention your last name? Or Barbara is okay? 

02:50:55
BARBARA COX I'm Barbara Cox. 

02:50:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Cox? 

02:50:55
BARBARA COX Yeah, uh-huh. 

02:50:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, and we happen to be? 

02:51:00
BARBARA COX We're neighbors. 

02:51:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Fellow- fellow San Diegans. We just found that out, um, but we'll do some work. But so let's all take a breath and settle in. And settle down. Whenever we- we do I think trance work in particular, we want to shift from the sort of the social gossip mind into some sort of settled-in, centered presence. So welcome. 

02:51:35
BARBARA COX Thank you. 

02:51:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Um, we- we don't know each other. You were at uh, the workshop I was doing yesterday afternoon, and, uh, I asked at the end of the workshop if anybody wanted to volunteer for the demo, and, uh, you came up. So um, welcome. 

02:51:55
BARBARA COX Thank you. 

02:51:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And do you want to just say generally what you- why you think your hand came up, or why you said, I'll do it? 

02:52:00
BARBARA COX Because I'm crazy. 

02:52:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yes. And you look comfortably crazy. 

02:52:10
BARBARA COX Yes, I'm comfortably crazy. 

02:52:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And from that place of comfortable craziness, what would you like to be able to create in your life? 

02:52:20
BARBARA COX The reason I came up, I- I told him I felt like he was like a Jedi master, I felt myself going into trance yesterday and I don't easily do that with, with trainers. With myself I do but not with- with trainers. So, I felt the potential there and what I'm looking to create is, I'm on a new path as my daughter's entering school more full-time and I'm going from part-time working to full-time work. I do my own private practice part-time and I have other possibilities coming in, and I'd like to find the clearest happiest prosperous path, to kind of narrow it down. That's what- where I'd like my subconscious to lead me. Because I have a lot of possibilities but during the time I had my daughter and the few years I took off, I felt a weird stagnation. 

02:53:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. 

02:53:15
BARBARA COX Of like not knowing where to go- Work-wise, it felt like things were stagnant, like never before. 

02:53:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Yeah. Great, thank you. Um, so your daughter is now eight. 

02:53:30
BARBARA COX She just turned eight. 

02:53:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, so- if I'm hearing correctly, correct me if I'm wrong, uh, you really want to have this shift in your professional life. In terms of? 

02:53:40
BARBARA COX More blossoming. 

02:53:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Blossoming. 

02:53:45
BARBARA COX Yes. 

02:53:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I was just joking with that hair, it shouldn't be too hard. So, if- if you could, and this is something I find very helpful, most of the time. If you could state your goal in five words or less, what would it be? What I want most to create in my life is...? And then you have five words maximum. 

02:54:15
BARBARA COX To create the clearest most prosperous, happy path. 

02:54:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Behhh. 

02:54:20
BARBARA COX That's- 

02:54:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm sorry ma'am, you've exceeded the limit. 

02:54:20
BARBARA COX Did I do more than...? Happy, prosperous work path. 

02:54:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good. 

02:54:30
BARBARA COX Okay. 

02:54:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And one- one to spare. That's great. So may we do some good work here today. That allows that really important... 

02:54:50
[sil.] 

02:54:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Positive future to become a reality for you. What I'd like to suggest that we do as a first step, and I say we- I'm going to be doing it in parallel with you, is- is take a few moments. This is something that we were doing in the workshop yesterday. It's to be able to shift our state in the most simple, natural, best way that we can. So, if you'd like to close your eyes and take a deep breath and it's the first positive connection that we're looking to find. It's what we might call a center. Some days it could be in your heart, in your belly. Something more basic than your verbal mind. And when you feel connection in whatever way to wisdom, to happiness, to the magic of curiosity. It's a good thing to sense where in your body Do you most sense that first basis of well-being? And if you'd like, whenever you feel it, you might even take one of your hands and touch it there. Just as a way of sensing that when you are asking yourself to create something, important, and known, it's nice to be able to let yourself drop down... 

02:57:35
[sil.] 

02:57:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Into that first place of knowing, of wisdom, and anything up above it can release. Whatever way that you find yourself back in that nice place of inner connection. Back in many beautiful flowers. Many beautiful dreams. Many beautiful colors. And begin to bloom now. And in a beautiful series of experiences over the coming days. And while you're at that, you sense that, it'd also be a very very nice thing to be able to let your awareness widen, gently, to enjoy pleasurably which particular presences and begin to join you as positive resources. They could be people in your life, or they could be people from history, that really know how. To support that process of beautiful, pleasurable, creative discovery unfolding over days, weeks, years. And you enjoy sensing just where those presences have a nice place all around you. Feel that nice aesthetic field of support. So that as you enjoy discovering giving birth again, to yourself, giving birth again. To the creativity now in this new part of your life. 

03:01:10
[sil.] 

03:01:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then as you feel that sand, that beautiful connection with it... 

03:01:25
[sil.] 

03:01:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And the multiple positive support all around. You can find the resonance, the music, the simplicity, the color of where you most want to create your life. At this particular place. As you come back out into the world, in a whole new way as a mother, as a therapist, as a woman, as a professional that really enjoys so much good connection within you and all around you. That's good. That's good. That's good. So nice to get back to your original whole. That's good. Just take a few more moments to sense what you discovered in your first wave. Living in San Diego of course, you know that there's so many more waves still to come. And then when you're ready, you can discover how your breathing can change, very comfortably. So you can let yourself come back out and into the room, open your eyes, we can chat for a little bit before the second wave. 

03:04:30
[sil.] 

03:04:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good morning. 

03:04:40
BARBARA COX Hi. 

03:04:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hi. And what did you discover there? 

03:04:45
BARBARA COX Very interesting. I don't know if it's that you were tuned in- We didn't talk much. What I'm working on is feeling connected with a community. 

03:05:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Connected to a community. 

03:05:00
BARBARA COX Community, and feeling a circle of support. 

03:05:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Feeling a circle of support. 

03:05:05
BARBARA COX And I felt something else, whooshing around in my space, all around external. Completing a circle. 

03:05:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Something completing a circle. 

03:05:20
BARBARA COX And the wave of- You said something about the first wave of San Diego, and I feel myself moving, like San Diego is like a first wave and there's a second wave coming. 

03:05:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN There's a second wave coming. 

03:05:35
BARBARA COX Something about moving. Which I've been feeling for a while, and the flowering. I forgot that I use the word blossoming, and I've done- I had a picture of- When you mentioned pleasure, something pleasurable, I anchored into a convention talk I gave last week and a graphic artist had picked my, um, logo to be iconic flowers at the bottom. I didn't tell them to do this, but the- I saw the iconic flowers come blossoming up from that talk that was really fun. And so it is symbolic for me, this blossoming out in many pictures in my life. So it popped in like, well this means- This is a symbol for me to, to work on. 

03:06:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And if you could say what you just said in five words or less? 

03:06:40
BARBARA COX Well, blossoming, a blossoming circle of support. 

03:06:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's what I thought you'd say. Yes, and I was inviting you to sense this somatic center and what do you feel in that place where you touched your hand? 

03:07:10
BARBARA COX I'm learning to come back in, it was blocked. 

03:07:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what exactly do you feel there? 

03:07:20
BARBARA COX A little bit of emptiness and pain. 

03:07:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hm. A little bit. 

03:07:30
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:07:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And do you think that will change soon? 

03:07:35
BARBARA COX Yes. 

03:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And as you feel that blossoming circle of community, what kind of changes do you think it's going to make now? 

03:07:50
BARBARA COX I see earth, ground, solid comfort. 

03:08:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And how much do you feel that earth in your belly now? 

03:08:05
BARBARA COX I feel a softness, a opening. 

03:08:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Opening, softness in your belly. 

03:08:20
BARBARA COX Possibility. 

03:08:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And on a scale of one to ten, how much do you feel that earthly presence? 

03:08:35
BARBARA COX About a five. 

03:08:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN About a five. 

03:08:35
BARBARA COX It's pushing. It's pushing through. 

03:08:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yes. And do you think it would be interesting, Barbara, to discover how you could deepen... 

03:08:50
BARBARA COX Yes. 

03:08:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That earthly connection, just a little bit more? 

03:08:55
BARBARA COX Mm-hm. 

03:08:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I wouldn't want you to go all the way, in this session. You might want to wait until tonight, but maybe just enough to feel beneath your verbal mind how much the wisdom of your unconscious can be returned to. Do you think that would be interesting? 

03:09:30
BARBARA COX It would be. 

03:09:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So when you're ready to discover how your unconscious mind can do that, close your eyes again. And really be able to feel, releasing images, releasing words, and discovering again underneath it all, that sense of a soft, earthly, secure rediscovering. And whatever layers were placed between it, that had numbed it or made it painful, or frightening, isn't it nice? And as you feel that connection you can enjoy getting back down to your roots. And really feeling the roots, the earth without (inaudible ). Beautiful, pregnant soil. This time, pregnant with you. So many seeds that got covered. So many seeds being allowed to burst, bloom, gently open. And then, of course, when you want those seeds to blossom. You really need a secure, comfortable, warm, safe place to let them beneath the surface. Begin to grow and for your own awareness, you can begin to look around at the sky, the space, the fields all around you. Who's there to support this time that wasn't there before? So many changes have happened in your life, between the time that you had to leave that place and now that you're returning. You've changed so much, in so many different ways. And so as you feel the roots of that gentle, earthly, pregnant, soulful presence, you can feel all around you which presences come and go, talking, singing. Looking with gentle eyes to let you know, it's time for the second wave. And you can enjoy from the inside out experiencing what the second wave brings, dreams, new communities, a sense of how old you are at different levels. A young child, that didn't know where she belonged. An ancient old woman, who has belonged in heeding community over many many many different years. 

03:15:15
[sil.] 

03:15:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And awoken. Beginning to emerge into the world as herself. And enjoying, like a peacock, like a flower, like a child, able to be happy again, her place. Her ground. Herself. 

03:16:15
[sil.] 

03:16:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And just enjoy that second wave. Anybody who sits at the ocean knows that the waves keep coming. There's a little lull, a beautiful, quiet sense between the waves. And then the next wave, carrying different experiences from deep, deep in the sea, bringing it to shore. Bringing it back to earth. And what a delightful experience to share with an eight-year-old, to share with a timeless, ageless, old woman. To be in the middle of a beautiful community and discovering who you really are in each new stage of your life. 

03:18:10
[sil.] 

03:18:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And when you feel what's awakening at the second wave... 

03:18:35
[sil.] 

03:18:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You can absorb that through your breath into every cell, every organ, every particle, every part, and absorb and breathe that wave. And allow it to transform your sense of self. 

03:19:20
[sil.] 

03:19:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's good. That's good. And as you see what you see, you can feel that warm earth, fertile with seeds and a beautiful connection that runs between... 

03:20:05
[sil.] 

03:20:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The image to the feeling, the feeling to the image, the image to the feeling, and beautiful feeling of something connecting again. The upper and the lower. So be it. 

03:20:40
[sil.] 

03:20:40
[ STEPHEN GILLIGAN Now you take a few more moments to experience that, and when you're ready, you can find and discover your body, all of the beautiful, healthy wisdom, beauty in your body. 

03:21:20
[sil.] 

03:21:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And draw completion to the second wave. And then when you're ready you can find your eyes opening again. 

03:21:40
[sil.] 

03:21:55
BARBARA COX Hi. 

03:22:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what did you find that the second wave brought you? 

03:22:10
BARBARA COX It felt like I was clearing out mud from the left side of my body. 

03:22:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Clearing out mud. That's a nice thing to do. And your local Jedi master says, Trust the Force, Barbara. And did that surprise you? 

03:22:35
BARBARA COX It confused me. 

03:22:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Confused you. Did it happily confuse you? 

03:22:40
BARBARA COX Yeah, it was a good thing. 

03:22:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Nice to be pleasurably confused, don't you think? 

03:22:45
BARBARA COX Yes, it's nice to be pleasurably confused. 

03:22:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You say that which a touch of sternness. 

03:22:55
BARBARA COX I- I think I'm stern. 

03:23:00
[sil.] 

03:23:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And am I right that the balance point is beginning to shift? 

03:23:10
BARBARA COX Yeah. I feel that in my body. 

03:23:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yes. 

03:23:15
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:23:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The balance point. 

03:23:15
BARBARA COX The left. 

03:23:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Continuing to shift. 

03:23:20
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:23:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is there something about the left side of your body makes it distinctive from the right? 

03:23:35
BARBARA COX I do have brain damage, so it might be that. But I keep hearing, like, something about my grandmother. It's a lineage thing, female lineage. 

03:23:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mm. And what does your grandmother have to say? 

03:23:50
BARBARA COX Be careful. 

03:23:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Be careful. And is that stern... 

03:23:50
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:23:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Or is that pleasurable? 

03:23:55
BARBARA COX She is worried. 

03:23:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She is worried. That's good to know. That you have a worried grandmother. Can you tell me what happened in terms of the brain damage? 

03:24:10
BARBARA COX I was born three and a half months early. 

03:24:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Three and a half months you were waiting to get to it. 

03:24:15
BARBARA COX Yeah. Yeah, I'm a miracle. 

03:24:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow. 

03:24:20
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:24:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Three and a half months and so... 

03:24:20
BARBARA COX I was supposed to die. 

03:24:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hmm. And I can see that you made a decision about that, didn't you? 

03:24:30
BARBARA COX I proved them wrong. 

03:24:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know, they said that about Dr. Erickson? 

03:24:35
BARBARA COX Ohh. I didn't know... 

03:24:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN When he was 17 and he was stricken with severe polio. 

03:24:40
BARBARA COX Ohh. 

03:24:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And he overheard the three doctors tell his mother that your son would probably die. And the rest is history. Now you've got me beat by a long shot. I was only one month premature. I was born- my mother went into tab- into labor at the Christmas dinner. And she didn't know it was me, she thought it was the mashed potatoes. And for an Irish baby, that's a great omen, you know. To be confused with a potato. There's a lot of nice, very interesting birthing stories. 

03:25:40
BARBARA COX Yes. 

03:25:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

03:25:45
BARBARA COX Healing. 

03:25:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So, are you ready for the third wave? 

03:25:50
BARBARA COX Yes. 

03:25:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Are you sure? 

03:25:55
BARBARA COX I'm sure. 

03:25:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know this one's going to be a little bit deeper? 

03:26:00
BARBARA COX Okay. 

03:26:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know that? 

03:26:00
BARBARA COX I don't know. 

03:26:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Tell me honestly how deep you think it really is going to be to allow a complete healing, on a scale of one to 10. Tell me honestly do you think it's going to be a five, or a seven? 

03:26:30
BARBARA COX An eight. 

03:26:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You think it's going to be an eight? 

03:26:30
BARBARA COX Maybe a 10. 

03:26:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Maybe, and I say that with very tender seriousness. And please use all of my support and all the support of the positive presences in your life. When you're ready you can close your eyes again. And be able to really let your healing self take you on the third wave. To feel in every part of your body past, present, and future. A beautiful sense of a healthy, happy aliveness, and in that process, letting yourself go as deep as you need to. To allow your body and all the different parts of yourself identity to feel the third wave. In the third wave you can find so many things flickering, popping, sparkling, moving, conversations with your grandmother. Conversations with yourself as a baby. Conversations with your community. Conversations, feelings, images, body, healthy, happy, safe, body. Of your deepest happiness, birthing again, blooming. So many different new weavings. Color, patterns, beautiful new radiant sands. I'm here, I'm here. That's a beautiful thing in a trance to discover how many changes can occur coincidentally, at the same time. Like a beautiful blurring of an old identity, blurring, moving like water, shifting and shaping in new ways. A whole new understanding of who you are. Your all new creative sense of self. What you're in the world to be able to do. You can enjoy that. Calling upon all the beautiful support, people that appear, beings that appear, places transform, and a beautiful opening of a flower. I'm not really understanding from a conscious distance why that flower is opening in such a beautiful, beautiful, perfect way. And you can see in the beautiful tradition of Japanese flower arranging, the beautiful calm sense of arranging different flowers in just the right aesthetic balance. And in the first stage, the flower arranging, everything goes by the book. This one is supposed to be exactly that way, that one is supposed to be exactly in that position. But as you begin to master, you begin to take into account all of the imperfections, all of the unique patterns of each stem. How it's crooked in some places, exactly where the thorns are. You begin to take all of those unique shapes and let them find a balance that expresses that beautiful uniqueness of every flower that's there. And it's such a nice thing, and then look at the new arrangement and take pleasure in all the balance of that new arrangement. Each day you can begin again with the curiosity, how to take into account the unique deviations from the norm that every flower, every experience, every person carries. And to discover just what you can do. And I think one of the most important learnings I ever received was from Dr. Erickson. I was staying in the guest room attached to the office right next door to the residence, and it was around dinner time, and I needed to bring something to Mrs. Erickson. I went through the backyard. I went in and knocked on the back door to the kitchen and Dr. Erickson said, Come in. And he was sitting at the kitchen table with a purple workout suit, cutting vegetables for the family dinner. And he looked up and said, with the deepest pleasure, I'm getting my workout. I was a young man who was studying karate and who had very rigid ideas about what a workout was. I was befuddled and confused. And then he looked a little bit more gently and a little bit more intensely and said, I always enjoy discovering what I can do, and then take great pleasure in doing that. One of those experiences that lay in the unconscious for many years. And 20 years later, it began to resonate and have a certain beautiful presence. It's always good to discover with you can do, every day. And then take great pleasure in doing that and see where it takes you. 

03:37:35
[sil.] 

03:37:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And you can take all the time to enjoy the multitude of different emotions and feelings and discoveries and identities and enjoy the trance, creating a new mosaic. A new mandala, a new comfortable, integrated self. And enjoy sharing that with your clients, with your daughter, even with your grandmother, wherever she might be. To enjoy sharing all your hard-earned livings and discoveries. With others, and I look forward to the next time that we meet, wherever that might be. In a dream, on the beaches of San Diego, and hearing about all the things that you let your unconscious mind teach you about who you really are and what you really can comfortably, happily live in this world. Now take all the time in the world. in the next moments, is to enjoy the completion of the third wave. And though there's so much more still to come, what a beautiful thing to look forward to. 

03:40:25
[sil.] 

03:40:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then when you've completed that third wave, you know you can continue to return to the tonight in your dreams. And when you come back into the room you can be comfortable and refreshed and appreciative of what you've been able to do for yourself, for your family, for your clients. Here today. May it continue in a variety of different ways. 

03:41:20
[sil.] 

03:41:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN When you're ready you find that your breathing changes. You'll find that the water is all around us now. 

03:41:45
[sil.] 

03:41:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A beautiful ocean, rivers, streams of consciousness forevermore, into the world. 

03:42:10
[sil.] 

03:42:35
BARBARA COX Hi. 

03:42:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hi. What a long, strange trip it is. 

03:42:40
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:42:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think George Bush said that. 

03:42:45
BARBARA COX That was trippy. 

03:42:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You look beautiful. 

03:42:50
BARBARA COX Thank you. 

03:42:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You look great. How are you? 

03:42:55
BARBARA COX Good. 

03:43:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Come here often? 

03:43:00
BARBARA COX An eternity. 

03:43:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN We've- we've got to end in just a few moments. Is there anything you want to briefly share in terms of our community learning process here? 

03:43:15
BARBARA COX The water was interesting because I felt like I was on the Titanic, and I saw myself drowning before the water. 

03:43:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right before? 

03:43:25
BARBARA COX And I just flew with it. I just floated around, drowning, splitting open, lot of splitting open in purple. I don't know what it meant but it was very trippy. 

03:43:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hm. 

03:43:40
BARBARA COX Yeah. 

03:43:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And was it pleasurable? 

03:43:45
BARBARA COX Yes it was- it was like I was releasing, it felt like icebergs coming out. 

03:43:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. I think my, my general sense s, you know, we start with a subtle body of light, if you will. 

03:43:55
BARBARA COX Right. 

03:44:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then, often we can emotionally lock, you know, those hard pieces around the body of light. 

03:44:05
BARBARA COX Right. Yeah. 

03:44:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And so when we experience those things in trance, like the shaking or trembling or the cracking, be a really nice thing, like we're, we're getting back to, uh, I think it was George Bush who also said I am the light. But what he didn't say was you are too. So, may you enjoy the light of your being. 

03:44:35
BARBARA COX Thank you. 

03:44:40
[sil.] 

03:44:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Um, I just want to say for one moment, um, I think we have a minute. Uh, you know, one of the things I just want to note for, uh, uh, our learning process that I talked about working with the three waves, if you will because, uh, you don't have to use those terms, waves. I, I rarely use it. But you think of doing trance in the session as a series of chunks, if you will. Um, I think it's not as helpful to think in one fell swoop, uh, like one big chunk, but if you can do a little piece and then have the person come out, you get feedback, and contained and then in- You are as much a hypnotic recipient as the therapist as somebody who's sharing. You're really trying to receive the feedback that they're giving as the instructions from their unconscious about what to do next, and the creative unconscious is not here, and it's not here. It's here. So, by putting it in to smaller chunks and, and the more, uh, the more support a person needs the smaller the chunks. Um, Barbara was pretty willing and able to, to open that space for herself. Um, but there'll be a lot of clients that you might work in one-minute chunks, or two-minute chunks, to be able to touch the place, for them to be able to share it a little bit. Not to analyze it, not to explain it, but to give you feedback. So one of the, the feedbacks on the first thing, if you- Perhaps you were hearing is that she is very visual and she had a lot of words, but the felt sense in the belly was not very developed. And so that's what led me in the second wave to talk about dropping more down into the feeling. So, um, that's, that's sort of the common general dissociation of how we, over time, through just education and also from emotional experience, we become a disembodied intellect. And we're living, uh, as James Joyce, my Irish ancestor, yeah, said, Mr. Duffy lived a short distance from his body. And, uh, this is the way of Western civilization, but as long as we're living a little bit away from Genlon calls 'felt sense', healing and transformation are not possible. So this is one of the things that trance can do. So we tried to gently get a person down to, to primary feeling again. Not to collapse into it, but to feel it and then allow the thinking and the visualization to come from, from that earth base, if you will. OK, so good luck with it all. And, uh, thank you all for your presence and participation.

Steve Andreas, MA 

03:48:30
STEVE ANDREAS Um, this is, the title of this is Helping a Client Explore their Metaphor for their Problem to Discover a Solution, and I'm going to do this content-free, uh, Randi volunteered to volunteer. Usually I go through a selection process, but I'm, I like efficiency, and, uh, we're not going to talk about the real situation that she's in. We're going to talk only about her metaphor for her situation. And then, uh, go on a joint discovery, uh, mess- uh, mission. And I'm supposed to read the educational objectives. To dis- One, to distinguish between a client's guiding metaphor and a mere figure of speech. Two, lift four- List four major criteria for expanding a client's metaphor in a useful way. So, this is Randi, and Randi is only told me a little bit about her metaphor, and you're in a hole, right? 

03:49:25
RANDI Yeah, I'd say that. 

03:49:25
STEVE ANDREAS And I want to explore this hole with you. 

03:49:30
RANDI OK. 

03:49:30
STEVE ANDREAS So, how big is it? 

03:49:35
RANDI Um, it's, it's big. 

03:49:40
STEVE ANDREAS Which? How big? 

03:49:40
RANDI It's, it's... 

03:49:40
STEVE ANDREAS No, is it this big or is it 30 feet out? Give me a little more description. 

03:49:45
RANDI Well, it's, it's, um, it's big and it's deep. It's, it's, it's very big, and very deep. 

03:49:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK, give me some numbers. How big? 

03:50:00
RANDI Umm. 

03:50:00
STEVE ANDREAS Half mile across? 

03:50:00
RANDI It's, uh, hm. It's a mile around. 

03:50:05
STEVE ANDREAS A mile around? 

03:50:10
RANDI A mile around. 

03:50:10
STEVE ANDREAS So I could do some trigonometry to figure out how far across it is. 

03:50:15
RANDI I never was really good with math. 

03:50:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So, it's a mile around, and, uh, were you- You said you were in the middle of it. 

03:50:25
RANDI I, I, I'd say, I'd say I'm in the middle of it. 

03:50:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:50:25
RANDI So I'm not all the way at the bottom, not at all. Somewhere in the middle of it. 

03:50:30
STEVE ANDREAS Not at the bottom. 

03:50:30
RANDI Not at the bottom. 

03:50:35
STEVE ANDREAS So are you floating in air? 

03:50:35
RANDI I'm sort of- Yeah, exactly. 

03:50:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:50:35
RANDI Exactly. Sort of- 

03:50:35
STEVE ANDREAS So, are you halfway down the hole? 

03:50:40
RANDI I'd, I'd say. Mm-hm. 

03:50:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:50:45
RANDI Cause it's sort of like a limbo kind of place. 

03:50:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. It's a limbo kind of place. So you're about halfway down, and how tall is this hole? 

03:50:55
RANDI Um, it's way up. Way, so. 

03:51:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:51:00
RANDI Way up. 

03:51:05
STEVE ANDREAS Way up. 

03:51:05
RANDI Way up, above. 

03:51:05
STEVE ANDREAS How far? A hundred feet? How many stories? 

03:51:10
RANDI I'd say, um, how high was that mountain we saw? Um, I'd say it's, uh, about 28 stories. 

03:51:20
STEVE ANDREAS 28 stories. OK, great. Roughly 300 feet. That's a big hole. Now how do you manage to stay in the middle of this hole? 

03:51:25
RANDI Hm. Well, I'd say that there are some things that really support me, beneath, so... 

03:51:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:51:35
RANDI ...it sort of holds me up in the middle. 

03:51:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So the hole goes down farther. 

03:51:40
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:51:40
STEVE ANDREAS But these things that, that are holding you up, are keeping you halfway up, up, halfway up from the bottom of the hole. 

03:51:45
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:51:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. I'd like you to close your eyes, and look at these things that are supporting you. What is supporting you? 

03:52:00
RANDI My daughter. 

03:52:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So it's actually your daughters, underneath you, holding you up? 

03:52:05
RANDI My daughter. Um, I wouldn't say, hm, I don't know that she's holding me up, but my thoughts of her hold me up, so it's not her... 

03:52:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:52:10
RANDI ...but it's my thoughts of her. 

03:52:15
STEVE ANDREAS Mmhm. 

03:52:15
RANDI Friends. 

03:52:15
STEVE ANDREAS And, and what form does, do your thoughts of her take? 

03:52:20
RANDI Hm. They're sort of cushiony. 

03:52:25
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry? 

03:52:25
RANDI They're sort of cushiony. 

03:52:25
STEVE ANDREAS Cushiony. 

03:52:25
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:52:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:52:30
RANDI Yeah, soft. 

03:52:30
STEVE ANDREAS So take a look at this cushion of thoughts. And I guess it has fairly soft, cushions are usually soft. 

03:52:35
RANDI Soft. Soft. Mmhm. Soft but firm. 

03:52:40
STEVE ANDREAS Firm. OK. Like a good mattress, huh? 

03:52:45
RANDI Mm. 

03:52:45
STEVE ANDREAS Accepts your body and... 

03:52:45
RANDI Mmhm. That's right. 

03:52:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. And how bout color, is there any color to this cushion? 

03:52:55
RANDI Yeah, it's, uh, sort of white but sparkly. 

03:53:00
STEVE ANDREAS White and sparkly. Now you said but sparkly. Is it OK to say and sparkly? 

03:53:10
RANDI It's OK to say and sparkly. White and sparkly. 

03:53:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. And, uh, is there anything else holding you up? 

03:53:15
RANDI Um, yeah I'd say, um, other, uh, friends and family and, um, my, something about myself. Uh, yeah. 

03:53:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:53:35
RANDI Definitely something about myself. 

03:53:40
STEVE ANDREAS And are these additional cushions? How does this work? 

03:53:40
RANDI No, they're just sort of different parts of the mattress. 

03:53:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Alright, so is it fairly level like a mattress, or did you just change that as a result of my... 

03:53:50
RANDI Yeah. 

03:53:55
STEVE ANDREAS ...saying a mattress. Cause they were more around it before, weren't they? 

03:54:00
RANDI Well, they, they sort of are. It's sort of, um, um, sort of thinking of, sort of a pillowy kind of mattress that kind of moves a little bit. 

03:54:05
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Like a waterbed? 

03:54:10
RANDI Sort- Yeah, like a waterbed. Right. Right. 

03:54:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK, good. So if you push down on one place it kinda goes up in another... 

03:54:15
RANDI Yes. 

03:54:15
STEVE ANDREAS And billows a little bit? 

03:54:15
RANDI Very much so. Mm. 

03:54:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So there you are in the middle of this hole, deep hole. You're about halfway up from the bottom. You're held up by thoughts of important people in your life. And its nice cushiony softness, and as you look around to the sides of this hole, what are the sides like? 

03:54:45
RANDI Hm. Uh, they're, they're dark. 

03:54:50
STEVE ANDREAS They're dark, OK. Black? 

03:54:50
RANDI Um, sort of brownish-black. 

03:54:55
STEVE ANDREAS Brownish-black. Can you tell what they're made of? 

03:55:00
RANDI My first, first thought was, like, like, mud. Kinda dark. 

03:55:05
STEVE ANDREAS OK, dark mud. But rigid enough I guess to hold up the side of the hole like earth, huh? Like a hole in the earth? 

03:55:10
RANDI Yeah, uh-huh. 

03:55:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now what are you doing in the situation? You- How are you dealing with this situation now? 

03:55:25
RANDI Um... 

03:55:25
STEVE ANDREAS This is the key question for the rest of you. 

03:55:30
RANDI OK. 

03:55:30
STEVE ANDREAS It's, uh, we're creating, um, well or eliciting, or discovering the person's metaphor, and then we need to go to what are they doing about it? This is somehow a problem for you, right? 

03:55:40
RANDI Yeah. 

03:55:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:55:40
RANDI Um, I'm keeping myself up. 

03:55:45
STEVE ANDREAS You're keeping yourself up. 

03:55:45
RANDI I'm, I'm keeping myself up. Uh, sort of floating in the hole. 

03:55:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK, and how's this working for you? 

03:55:50
RANDI Um, it works most of the time. 

03:55:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK, so it sort of half-ass works. 

03:56:00
RANDI Half-ass, cause the times that it doesn't work, it's not good. 

03:56:00
STEVE ANDREAS And what happens when it doesn't work? 

03:56:05
RANDI Um, when it doesn't work it hurts, a lot. 

03:56:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. What happens, just stay in the metaphor, you're in this cushion. 

03:56:15
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:56:15
STEVE ANDREAS And this cushion works most of the time, right? 

03:56:20
RANDI Yeah. 

03:56:20
STEVE ANDREAS But when it doesn't, what happens? 

03:56:20
RANDI Um... 

03:56:20
STEVE ANDREAS You go to the bottom of the hole? 

03:56:25
RANDI I, I, I start sinking down? 

03:56:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK, do you sink down fairly slowly, or do you sink down more rapidly? 

03:56:30
RANDI Um, most of the time I'd say it's, uh, fairly sl- fairly slowly. 

03:56:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:56:40
RANDI But then there's like these kind of dips. 

03:56:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK so you sink fairly slowly for a while and then there's the huge dip. Does that mean you drop to the bottom of the hole? 

03:56:45
RANDI Uh, never to the- never to the bottom. 

03:56:50
STEVE ANDREAS You've never, never even seen the bottom? 

03:56:50
RANDI Nn- well, close. 

03:56:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:57:00
RANDI But never really to the bottom. 

03:57:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. If you look up, what's- There's, there's this hole, goes up, uh, about 300 feet or so. Can you see anything out of the hole? 

03:57:10
RANDI Yeah, um, I do. I, I, I see sort of this haze, and then... 

03:57:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK, so there's haze. 

03:57:20
RANDI Haze and then there's, there's some light, and... 

03:57:20
STEVE ANDREAS There's some... 

03:57:20
RANDI Yeah. 

03:57:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. What kind of light? Daylight, or twilight, or...? 

03:57:25
RANDI It's like, it's like twilight. 

03:57:30
STEVE ANDREAS Twilight. 

03:57:30
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:57:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK, is it morning twilight or evening twilight? 

03:57:30
RANDI Um, it, it actually could, could be either, um, but I'd say for right now it's probably evening. Uh uh, morning twilight, morning twilight. 

03:57:45
STEVE ANDREAS Morning twilight, OK. And, uh, my guess is that this morning twilight is more attractive than the hole, is that correct? 

03:57:55
RANDI Uh-huh. 

03:57:55
STEVE ANDREAS Is that right? 

03:57:55
RANDI Yes. 

03:57:55
STEVE ANDREAS I'm not putting words in your mouth? 

03:57:55
RANDI Yes, no that's very right. 

03:58:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So you're being supported by this cushion of your thoughts of your family and friends. And, uh, how are you- are you sitting or standing on this cushion? 

03:58:15
RANDI Um, I'd say, I'd say I'm standing when I'm more up and sitting when I'm kinda sinking. 

03:58:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK so sitting when you're sinking, so now let's just try something a little bit. Right at this moment are you standing or, or sitting? 

03:58:40
RANDI Um, I'd say I'm, right at this moment I'm sitting. 

03:58:45
STEVE ANDREAS You're sitting? In the, well I know you're sitting here in the chair. 

03:58:45
RANDI Right, so, yeah, so I'm a little, um... 

03:58:50
STEVE ANDREAS I mean in the metaphor. 

03:58:50
RANDI In the metaphor, no, in the metaphor, I'm, I'm standing. 

03:58:55
STEVE ANDREAS You're standing, OK. 

03:58:55
RANDI Mmhm. 

03:58:55
STEVE ANDREAS Find out what happens if you sit down. 

03:59:00
RANDI Umm, it doesn't feel like I'm, it doesn't feel like I'm sinking. 

03:59:05
STEVE ANDREAS It doesn't feel like you're sinking. 

03:59:10
RANDI Hm-nn. 

03:59:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:59:10
RANDI No, it doesn't feel like I'm sinking. 

03:59:10
STEVE ANDREAS Then what does it feel like? 

03:59:15
RANDI It feels like I'm sitting kinda comfortably, uh, with these thoughts of people all around me. 

03:59:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

03:59:25
RANDI Images of people around me. 

03:59:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK so there's a- Is there any difference between sitting and standing now? 

03:59:35
RANDI Actually sitting seems more comfortable right now than standing. 

03:59:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. What else could you do? What if you lay on this, this cushion of thoughts? I'm just exploring different possibilities of things that are under her control. 

03:59:50
RANDI Yeah, um. 

03:59:50
STEVE ANDREAS The hole is not under her control, the other things are- We're leaving those alone. 

03:59:55
RANDI Um, laying doesn't, doesn't feel as comfortable. 

04:00:05
STEVE ANDREAS Doesn't feel as comfortable. Which was are you lying, on your back or your stomach? 

04:00:05
RANDI Um. 

04:00:10
STEVE ANDREAS Or side? 

04:00:10
RANDI Well, well, I was lying on my back. 

04:00:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:00:15
RANDI If I were to lie on my stomach, it would be more comfortable. 

04:00:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Does that work for you? What happens when you do that? 

04:00:20
RANDI Um, that's, that's OK. That's OK. 

04:00:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now, what- what I want you to do- We've just made a very small change, and just as an example, so now you're lying on your stomach. 

04:00:45
RANDI No, I sat back up. 

04:00:45
STEVE ANDREAS You sat back up. Well maybe you'd prefer to sit back up. What is better about sitting back up? 

04:00:55
RANDI Um, right now it just feels a little safer. 

04:01:00
STEVE ANDREAS Safer. OK. Now, I would guess that you'd like to be out of this hole, is that right? 

04:01:10
RANDI Yeah. 

04:01:10
STEVE ANDREAS A wild guess. Now, let's say, open your eyes now for a little while. Let's say we went- We're walking down an imaginary road and we find this woman in a hole. And the hole is about 300 feet deep, and about a thousand feet wide, something like that, and she's in the middle of this, cushioned and supported by her thoughts of her family, right? 

04:01:40
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:01:40
STEVE ANDREAS What advice could we give her? 

04:01:45
RANDI Um, I would tell her to, uh, to reach out to, to those people that... 

04:01:55
STEVE ANDREAS Reach out to other people? 

04:01:55
RANDI ...might be there to support her. 

04:02:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Are there any other people around? 

04:02:00
RANDI I'm sorry? 

04:02:00
STEVE ANDREAS Are there any other people around in this hole? How could you do that in this context of this big hole? 

04:02:05
RANDI OK, so, uh... 

04:02:10
STEVE ANDREAS Pick up a cell phone? 

04:02:15
RANDI How could she do that? Um, well she could, she could reach out to them, um, in her, maybe, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how. I don't know how she could do that. 

04:02:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well, reaching out to other people sounds like, to me, a very useful thing to do. If you're alone in a big hole, and you're being supported by your thoughts of important... 

04:02:40
RANDI Of these people 

04:02:40
STEVE ANDREAS ...people. Uh, that's, I think, useful. But there's nothing like the real flesh and blood. 

04:02:50
RANDI That's- that's it. 

04:02:50
STEVE ANDREAS Isn't that right? 

04:02:50
RANDI That's exactly right. 

04:02:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now, they're your thoughts, right? 

04:03:00
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:03:00
STEVE ANDREAS They're holding you up. 

04:03:00
RANDI They're- yes, they are, my thoughts. 

04:03:05
STEVE ANDREAS OK. What if you were to think different thoughts? 

04:03:10
RANDI How do you mean? 

04:03:15
STEVE ANDREAS What if you were to think about thoughts of reaching out to them? These people. You said your daughter? 

04:03:20
RANDI Yeah. 

04:03:20
STEVE ANDREAS And other people? 

04:03:25
RANDI Yeah. Um, well if I think about thoughts of reaching out to them, um, sometimes that works, and, and I can do that. 

04:03:40
STEVE ANDREAS Mmhm. 

04:03:40
RANDI And other times I don't wanna trouble them with my thoughts. 

04:03:45
STEVE ANDREAS You don't want to trouble them. 

04:03:45
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:03:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Have you checked with them whether you're troubling them or not? 

04:03:50
RANDI Um... 

04:03:55
STEVE ANDREAS I see a smile, I think I know the answer. 

04:03:55
RANDI Yeah, yes, yes I have checked with them. 

04:04:00
STEVE ANDREAS And did they say, yeah, you're troubling them? 

04:04:05
RANDI Yeah, no, they say no, of course you're not troubling. 

04:04:05
STEVE ANDREAS And you don't believe them, what? 

04:04:10
RANDI I think they're, I have kind people, some kind people in my life, um. Sometimes though when I- well, sometimes it's not true. Sometimes when I do check in with some people I find that I am troubling them. 

04:04:25
STEVE ANDREAS Sometimes, sure. 

04:04:25
RANDI Yes. 

04:04:25
STEVE ANDREAS How do you know this? 

04:04:25
RANDI Um, they might, uh... 

04:04:30
STEVE ANDREAS Look at their watch? 

04:04:35
RANDI Yeah. 

04:04:35
STEVE ANDREAS They start walking toward the door or something? 

04:04:35
RANDI Yeah, well, you know, yes. Some of that is, um, it is, you said cell phone. But some of that is, you know, through a conversation. They're not around, they're really not around. 

04:04:45
STEVE ANDREAS Mm. 

04:04:45
RANDI So some of that is through telephone conversation or whatever, and so... 

04:04:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK, good. So you have ways of telling? 

04:04:50
RANDI Yeah, they get like, kind of agitated... 

04:04:50
STEVE ANDREAS When, when you're being a burden, or, or being a fifth wheel or something like that. Is that right? 

04:04:55
RANDI Mm, yeah. Fifth wheel, that doesn't fit. 

04:04:55
STEVE ANDREAS Oh ok. 

04:04:55
RANDI But burden fits. 

04:05:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now, I want you to just try this out. This is all experimentation and all playful, and uh, by the way this method is still in the process of being developed, so there's a lot of stuff we don't know yet. It's developed by a way by a guy named Andrew T. Austin in the UK. Very interesting and very, uh, creative guy. I don't always agree with him, sometimes he's wrong, sometimes I'm wrong. But, uh, it's still a process being developed. So you have these thoughts of you under you, cushioning you. 

04:05:30
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:05:35
STEVE ANDREAS And there are several different, uh, thoughts of different people, right? 

04:05:40
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:05:40
STEVE ANDREAS Pick one of them, and rather than just thoughts of the person in a particular context, or- Well, tell me more about the thoughts. Ho- What form do the thoughts take? 

04:05:50
RANDI Um... 

04:05:50
STEVE ANDREAS Besides the cushion. 

04:05:50
RANDI Yeah, uh, the thoughts come in the form of how much I know I'm loved by them. 

04:06:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So you have images of being loved by them. 

04:06:00
RANDI Yes. 

04:06:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK, great. That's very nice, that's very useful, I'm sure. I wouldn't want to mess with that. But I might want to add to it. Um, you spoke of reaching out. 

04:06:15
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:06:15
STEVE ANDREAS What if you made, uh, took one of these thoughts of a person that is special to you, and loving you, and modify it by adding in some kind of interaction between you and them, right now. 

04:06:30
RANDI Um... 

04:06:30
STEVE ANDREAS Some kind of literally reaching out. 

04:06:35
RANDI Yeah, uh, well, it would be a, a, a, my reaching out and part of my reaching out would be that, um, I'm needing something from them and um, at the same time I'd be asking them if I was bothering them. 

04:06:55
STEVE ANDREAS At the same time? 

04:06:55
RANDI Probably. 

04:06:55
STEVE ANDREAS I think a sequence works better. 

04:06:55
RANDI OK. So yeah, so maybe it wouldn't be at the same time, but it would be one after the other. 

04:07:00
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:07:05
RANDI You know, like, like I'm feeling bad about this and I'm sorry I'm, I'm worrying you about this. 

04:07:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK, so for you reaching out would be to say I need something from you. 

04:07:15
RANDI Or even just, I need you to, uh, listen. 

04:07:15
STEVE ANDREAS What's that? 

04:07:20
RANDI Or I need you to listen. 

04:07:20
STEVE ANDREAS Need you to listen. I want to be heard. 

04:07:20
RANDI Right. 

04:07:20
STEVE ANDREAS Is that right? 

04:07:25
RANDI Yes. 

04:07:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So, try modifying one of these cushions a little bit to include your interaction, your reaching out, your wanting to be heard. Um, in whatever way is appropriate for you, cause they're your thoughts, right? 

04:07:45
RANDI Mmhm. Yeah, um, so maybe... 

04:07:50
STEVE ANDREAS I don't need to know the, the nature of this. Just do it on your own. 

04:07:50
RANDI OK, alright, good. 

04:07:55
STEVE ANDREAS You know, if you want some guidance, let me know. 

04:07:55
RANDI No, uh-uh. Got it. OK. 

04:08:05
STEVE ANDREAS And what happens if you do that? 

04:08:05
RANDI Um. 

04:08:05
STEVE ANDREAS What do you notice? 

04:08:05
RANDI I notice that, uh, the cushion is a little bit more, is a little bit more supportive. 

04:08:15
STEVE ANDREAS More supportive. 

04:08:15
RANDI Uh-huh. 

04:08:15
STEVE ANDREAS Good, that sounds good to me. So does it actually bring you up out of the hole a little, or is it just more solid and... 

04:08:20
RANDI Just, just less into the hole. 

04:08:25
STEVE ANDREAS Less into the hole. 

04:08:25
RANDI Uh-huh. 

04:08:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK, now less into the hole sounds like more out of the hole. 

04:08:35
RANDI Yeah, well, well it, but the, I wasn't going- 

04:08:40
STEVE ANDREAS You weren't actually going up. 

04:08:40
RANDI No, sort of just staying level. 

04:08:40
STEVE ANDREAS More, more solid though? 

04:08:40
RANDI More solid, more solid. 

04:08:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:08:45
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:08:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK, now I had you, I had asked you to do just one of the people. 

04:08:50
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:08:50
STEVE ANDREAS Do another one. Do the same thing, whatever you did with that one, do it with that one. 

04:09:00
RANDI OK. 

04:09:00
STEVE ANDREAS And then what do you notice when you do that? 

04:09:05
RANDI There's, um, less of a dip. 

04:09:10
STEVE ANDREAS Less of a dip. 

04:09:10
RANDI Less of a dip, so maybe, maybe now it's feeling like more of a scaffold, actually. 

04:09:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK, more supportive, more, more solid, is that right? So it's not just a cushiony thing anymore. 

04:09:25
RANDI No, it's more firming than the mattress. 

04:09:25
STEVE ANDREAS Firming it up. 

04:09:25
RANDI OK, now I don't know how many other people you have in there that are supporting you, in terms of your images of them. 

04:09:30
STEVE ANDREAS Mmhm. But, uh, do several more. Just the way you've done before, whatever you did with them, and it might be a little different with each person, because different people are different. So the actual images might be quite different, but the general theme would be the same. 

04:09:55
RANDI Mmhm, yeah. 

04:10:00
STEVE ANDREAS And what do you notice when you do that? 

04:10:00
RANDI Um, well I haven't... 

04:10:00
STEVE ANDREAS What's that? 

04:10:05
RANDI I have an image of that, um, as useful- It feels more now like, you know the safety nets, like if you're kind of falling off a building or something and there's a... 

04:10:15
STEVE ANDREAS Uh-huh. 

04:10:15
RANDI ...safety net. 

04:10:15
STEVE ANDREAS Uh-huh. 

04:10:15
RANDI It's kind of firm, that, that's the image. So I guess it would be much more firm. 

04:10:25
STEVE ANDREAS Much more firm. 

04:10:25
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:10:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now, when you said much more firm just now, you raised your hands higher than before. Are you higher up out of the hole? 

04:10:30
RANDI Yeah. Mmhm. 

04:10:30
STEVE ANDREAS I think we know how to get you out of this hole. 

04:10:35
RANDI Hm, well... 

04:10:35
STEVE ANDREAS What do you think? 

04:10:35
RANDI Um, maybe. 

04:10:40
STEVE ANDREAS Maybe. OK, let's check it out. Because once you have something that works inside the metaphor, I want you to take it to your real life situation. 

04:10:50
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:10:50
STEVE ANDREAS And try it there. And we don't need to know anything about it. But try the same kind of thing there, in your life situation. Take a little while to do that. 

04:11:05
[sil.] 

04:11:10
STEVE ANDREAS Find out how well it works there. 

04:11:15
RANDI Hm. 

04:11:15
STEVE ANDREAS Go through your day, high points, the low points, the mediocre points, and whatever. 

04:11:25
RANDI Um. So it, it works, it works some. 

04:11:35
STEVE ANDREAS It works some. 

04:11:35
RANDI Uh, uh, yeah. 

04:11:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. How could we, how could you improve on that? 

04:11:40
RANDI Um, well, um, in, in, in my day and, and this is really troubling to me, um, this... 

04:11:55
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry, I can't quite hear. 

04:11:55
RANDI In my day and, and when these are, if I'm going through my day and when this is troubling to me, um, those supports, they, they're not, they're not really there. 

04:12:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:12:10
RANDI So. 

04:12:10
STEVE ANDREAS Now in the metaphor it was your thoughts of doing these things that supported you. 

04:12:15
RANDI Right. 

04:12:15
STEVE ANDREAS What prevents you from having these thoughts? During the day? 

04:12:20
RANDI Um, there are, there are moments where I guess I, I lose, I lose, uh, track of those thoughts. 

04:12:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:12:30
RANDI Yeah. Mmhm. 

04:12:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK. How could we make sure that you don't lose track of these thoughts? 

04:12:35
RANDI I was hoping you could help me with that. 

04:12:40
STEVE ANDREAS Ah, different people have different ways of doing this. One is to, uh, attach a little velcro to these thoughts so that they stay put. And it may sound silly and stupid but it can, it can really work. Works great for ADHD, too. Kids whose picture's kinda wander all around. Teach them to put velcro on the back of their images and then stick them down on something. You know that little sound it makes when those little hooks catch? Kkk-kk. Kkk- like that. Now another way would be to attach to this, uh, this hole, there, the, uh, cushion of these thoughts were essentially covering the bottom of the hole, is that right? 

04:13:25
RANDI Yes. 

04:13:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So they're there, even if you lose track of them, it doesn't mean they vanish. It means they're still there, you just didn't notice them. Your attention went somewhere else. Like the feeling of your bottom on the chair, you probably haven't been aware of it, but as soon as I mention it, you can become aware of it. It's something that's there all the time. Try doing something like that, and, um, you know different people have different ways of doing it. Whatever works for you. 

04:14:05
RANDI OK. 

04:14:10
STEVE ANDREAS Have you got a way? 

04:14:10
RANDI Mmhm, yes, sort of a there's sort of a new kind of lining in the bottom of the hole. 

04:14:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK, so you've got a new kind of lining, so it's more stable? Is that right? 

04:14:25
RANDI Yeah, uh-huh. It's, it's almost like a, it's almost like a floorboard. 

04:14:30
STEVE ANDREAS OK. A floorboard. I noticed you gestured with your hand up rather than down. Before it was like this. Interesting, OK. So, try this in the real world. Go to your real world situation. What the metaphor represents and don't tell us about it, just, well tell us how well it works, but other than that, the rest is just your own information. 

04:15:00
RANDI Yeah, I, um, I kinda feel like I'm standing on the floorboards. 

04:15:05
STEVE ANDREAS Mmhm. 

04:15:05
RANDI So it's, it feels pretty solid under... 

04:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:15:10
RANDI My feet right now. 

04:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS Now go through your day, uh, different parts of the day, just a typical day, and make sure it works all the time. Because earlier it worked part of the time, right? 

04:15:20
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:15:20
STEVE ANDREAS I want to make sure it works all the time. Even if you're abducted by a terrorist or something like that, that you still have this floorboard under you. 

04:15:40
RANDI Um. It works, it works more, it works more of the day. 

04:15:45
STEVE ANDREAS It works more of the day. 

04:15:45
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:15:45
STEVE ANDREAS That suggests that there's part of the day it doesn't. Is that right? 

04:15:50
RANDI Yeah. 

04:15:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK, what's the problem there? 

04:15:55
RANDI Um... 

04:15:55
STEVE ANDREAS What happens in the, this particular context? 

04:16:00
RANDI Uh... 

04:16:00
STEVE ANDREAS Or several maybe. 

04:16:00
RANDI That, in that particular context in just one, one part of the day, it, it, um, it just, it feels like I just kinda, there's a crack in the floorboard. 

04:16:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK, there's a crack in the floorboard. 

04:16:15
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:16:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Um, and these are... How can you fix thi so that it's more permanent? Because this is something you've built, right? In your mind? 

04:16:25
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:16:25
STEVE ANDREAS First it was a cushion and then you changed the content of the images a little bit, to include the reaching out and so on. I'm just recapitulating a little, partly for my own memory, and then, uh, it became more like a floorboard after I talked about different ways of making it more, uh, solid and lasting. But there's something about this one context or- Is it one or several? 

04:16:50
RANDI It's, it's one. 

04:16:50
STEVE ANDREAS One context, OK. Somehow it doesn't work in that one context, is that right? 

04:16:55
RANDI Yeah. 

04:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS What's missing? And again, you don't have to tell me what's missing. 

04:17:00
RANDI Just, OK. 

04:17:05
STEVE ANDREAS But I want you to go on a search for what's missing, so that you can add it in. 

04:17:10
[sil.] 

04:17:15
RANDI Uh, that's just it. I have a hard time adding that in. 

04:17:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK, but you know what it is? 

04:17:20
RANDI Uh-huh. 

04:17:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK, how could I give you, um, some assistance in adding it in, um, without your talking about the content? It might be a little tricky. 

04:17:35
RANDI Um, I don't know. Somehow I can't, I can't access thoughts that help me with that. Or, or, yeah I just can't. 

04:17:45
STEVE ANDREAS Now, let me go on a little bit of a side trip here. You have a daughter who's special to you, is that right? 

04:17:50
RANDI Mmmhm. 

04:17:55
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Do you ever not know that she's here, on the planet? 

04:18:00
RANDI No. 

04:18:00
STEVE ANDREAS If I ask you about your daughter you could have an image of her come right to your mind, right? That's the kind of stability I would like you to have with your image. 

04:18:10
RANDI OK. 

04:18:10
STEVE ANDREAS You having some feelings now. Will you tell me a little about those? 

04:18:15
RANDI Yeah, just, um, not being able to access those thoughts, uh, it's painful. 

04:18:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, sure. 

04:18:25
RANDI Yeah. 

04:18:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well, they're nourishing thoughts, right? 

04:18:30
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:18:30
STEVE ANDREAS So if you can't access them, then there's a hole. 

04:18:35
RANDI There is a hole. 

04:18:35
STEVE ANDREAS Right? OK, now is this something that would generally cause grief? Some kind of loss? Or is it just that you can't hold on to the thought? 

04:18:50
RANDI I'd say, maybe a little of both things. 

04:18:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:18:55
RANDI Some of both. 

04:19:00
STEVE ANDREAS Now, why is it difficult for you to hold on to to the thought? Does it go running out the door? 

04:19:05
RANDI No, I uh, I just, I, I can't, I can't seem to get a sense of the experience of it. So, um, I don't know if that makes any sense, but. 

04:19:25
STEVE ANDREAS Well it makes sense, but there's a little lack of detail. 

04:19:25
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:19:25
STEVE ANDREAS Um, so let me explain more a little bit with you. Um, you have some thoughts of your daughter, and of reaching out to her... 

04:19:35
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:19:35
STEVE ANDREAS And in a certain context it's hard for you to access that. 

04:19:40
RANDI No no no, no no no. 

04:19:40
STEVE ANDREAS Oh I got it wrong. 

04:19:45
RANDI I must have misunderstood you. No I can always access thoughts. 

04:19:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:19:50
RANDI My daughter, yeah. 

04:19:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:19:50
RANDI Well, mm, I'm sorry. 

04:19:55
STEVE ANDREAS Maybe yes, maybe no, huh? 

04:19:55
RANDI Maybe yes maybe no because, uh, right when I'm in that, when I'm in that kinda hole, um, maybe I'm, maybe I'm not accessing those thoughts, or, um, yeah maybe, maybe I'm not. 

04:20:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. When, how do you lose them? I just asked you recently about your daughter, and any time you can think of her then you can get an image of her, and hopefully also hear her voice and also feel her touch in terms of however you hug or interact and so on, is that right? 

04:20:30
RANDI Mmm. 

04:20:30
STEVE ANDREAS How do you manage to lose something like this? That seems awfully careless. 

04:20:40
RANDI Uh, uh, I think, I think, uh, the dark, the, the dark that hole, it kinda just takes over. 

04:20:50
STEVE ANDREAS Well, it could be that the dark hole- We need to find out the sequence here. Does the dark hole take over and then you lose the thoughts, or do you lose the thoughts and then the dark hole takes over? 

04:21:05
RANDI I, I kinda feel like the darkness overshadows the thoughts. 

04:21:10
STEVE ANDREAS Overshadows the thoughts, OK. 

04:21:15
RANDI Yeah, mmhm. 

04:21:15
STEVE ANDREAS Now, even with your eyes closed, you can see light, right? 

04:21:20
RANDI Mmhm, yeah. 

04:21:20
STEVE ANDREAS And you can imagine a light in a dark room? 

04:21:25
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:21:25
STEVE ANDREAS Right? So even if the hole overshadows, do you have some kind of internal lighting you can turn on? So that you wouldn't lose that? 

04:21:35
RANDI Have to find the switch. 

04:21:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:21:40
RANDI Mmhm. Yeah. 

04:21:45
STEVE ANDREAS Does that work for you? Try that in the real life situation. 

04:21:55
RANDI Mm. It's better. 

04:22:05
STEVE ANDREAS Better, but not good enough. Right? 

04:22:05
RANDI Hoping for a little more light. 

04:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS Huh? 

04:22:10
RANDI Hoping for a little more light. 

04:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS A little more light. 

04:22:10
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Well, can you give it a little more light? It's your brain. 

04:22:20
RANDI Mm. Yeah. 

04:22:25
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Is it enough now? 

04:22:30
RANDI It's pretty close. 

04:22:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well? That's not good enough for me. 

04:22:35
RANDI Pretty close. 

04:22:35
STEVE ANDREAS Close is no cigar. Brighten it up a little more in there. Your inner light. 

04:22:50
RANDI Yeah. 

04:22:50
STEVE ANDREAS You've been hiding it under a bushel basket? 

04:22:55
RANDI Yeah, it's, it's better. 

04:23:00
[sil.] 

04:23:05
STEVE ANDREAS And what is that like now? What do you notice when you do that? 

04:23:10
RANDI Hm. I, um, I feel a little lighter. 

04:23:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:23:15
RANDI Mmhm. Yeah, I feel lighter. 

04:23:20
STEVE ANDREAS And what's the hole like now? 

04:23:25
RANDI Um, interesting. Before you said that I, I, I wasn't feeling in the hole. 

04:23:30
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, too bad. 

04:23:30
RANDI I wasn't feeling in the hole. I was feeling like I was above it. 

04:23:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK, is that all right with you? 

04:23:35
RANDI That's very alright with me. 

04:23:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK, now. Just in case you slip into the hole, let's make sure you know how to get out of it. Put yourself into the hole. In fact, put yourself back in the way it was originally, where you had these thoughts that were sort of wobbly cushiony, uh, soft and gentle, but a little bit unstable. And then run through the various things that we did to get you out of the hole. That you did, really. With a little guidance. 

04:24:05
RANDI OK. 

04:24:10
STEVE ANDREAS They get you out of the hole? 

04:24:10
RANDI Yeah, it's- now it's kind of like, you know those kind of scaffolds that are on a crane. It's kind of just pulling me up out of the hole. 

04:24:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So where are you now? 

04:24:20
RANDI I'm, I'm three quarters of the way up. 

04:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:24:25
RANDI See- I, I, I see the light outside the hole. 

04:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS You see the light. 

04:24:35
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:24:35
STEVE ANDREAS Uh-huh, so the hole can't overshadow you now? 

04:24:35
RANDI Um, no cause I'm, I'm sort of looking towards the light. 

04:24:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:24:45
RANDI And, and interesting that, um, some of the people that were underneath me are now kind of up there at the top. 

04:24:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK, some of the people are up there at the top. OK and how- What's your relationship for those people? How are you interacting, can you wave at them, or... 

04:25:00
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:25:00
STEVE ANDREAS What's going on? 

04:25:00
RANDI They're sort of cheering me on. 

04:25:05
STEVE ANDREAS Cheering you on. OK, well that sounds good. Now you said you were about two thirds or three quarters of the way up? 

04:25:10
RANDI Uh huh. 

04:25:15
STEVE ANDREAS But a little, a little while ago you were all the way up out of the hole, is that right? 

04:25:20
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:25:20
STEVE ANDREAS So, what did you not do to get yourself all the way out of the hole? 

04:25:25
RANDI Um, I guess I didn't, uh, turn on enough light. Um. 

04:25:35
STEVE ANDREAS You didn't what? Turn on enough light? 

04:25:35
RANDI Turn on enough light. 

04:25:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:25:40
RANDI Um, um, there's, it's almost like there's a- It's kind of, it's kind of stopped at a certain point and I have to like climb my way out. 

04:25:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:25:55
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:25:55
STEVE ANDREAS Is there a way to climb out? 

04:26:00
RANDI Hm, yeah. Mmhm. 

04:26:05
STEVE ANDREAS OK, go ahead and do that then. Tell me a little bit about what the way is. Is there some little steps, cut in the side of the hole? 

04:26:10
RANDI No, I'm kind of seeing, there's like a, like a rope on the crane kind of thing. I have to, I have to grab it. 

04:26:15
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:26:20
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:26:20
STEVE ANDREAS Go ahead and do that now. 

04:26:25
RANDI Yeah. Yeah, sort of, mmhm. 

04:26:30
STEVE ANDREAS So are you out of the hole now? 

04:26:35
RANDI Just about, I have one foot out. 

04:26:35
STEVE ANDREAS One foot out. Well, let's get them both out. 

04:26:40
RANDI Uh huh. Yeah, uh huh. 

04:26:40
STEVE ANDREAS And I suggest you walk around a bit. There are other people up there? 

04:26:45
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:26:45
STEVE ANDREAS You can interact with them? 

04:26:50
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:26:55
STEVE ANDREAS Good. Now take this last part back into real life. The real life context in which the hole happens to appear sometime. How does it work now? How does it- Can you translate that back into reality? 

04:27:10
RANDI Um, yeah I mean my sense of it is that the hole's there but it's not so dark. 

04:27:20
STEVE ANDREAS Uh-huh. 

04:27:20
RANDI It's not so dark. 

04:27:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:27:25
RANDI Yeah. 

04:27:30
STEVE ANDREAS And what do you do when you're out of the hole? 

04:27:30
RANDI Um, well I'm walking around like you said, um, but I'm, I'm smiling. 

04:27:40
STEVE ANDREAS OK. There are other people up there, right? 

04:27:40
RANDI Mmhm, there are people up there. 

04:27:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now there's one more little think I'd like you to do. You spoke earlier of, uh, interacting with people when you need something from them. And I would like you to experiment with, um, interacting with people where you're giving something to them, rather than asking for something from you. 

04:28:05
RANDI Mm. 

04:28:05
STEVE ANDREAS And it could be just little things like a curious thing you heard on TV the other night or something like that, or just something that, that stirs you. Something that is alive in you, that you remember for some reason. It was funny, it was moving, it was touching or something like that. So that you're bringing something to them. 

04:28:30
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:28:30
STEVE ANDREAS Because I think that could be a very powerful piece of this. Does that make sense to you? 

04:28:35
RANDI Um, yes and no, because that's typically the way I reach out to people is by giving something to them, instead of... 

04:28:40
STEVE ANDREAS I see, OK. 

04:28:40
RANDI ...asking. So easy to do. 

04:28:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Well, maybe that's, uh, unnecessary. If you do that already, that's fine. I was worried that you might be always, only be interacting with other people when you wanted something from them. 

04:28:55
RANDI No, no that's rare for me actually. 

04:28:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK good, good. That's covered. OK fine. 

04:29:05
RANDI It's usually the other way. 

04:29:05
STEVE ANDREAS Uh huh. When you are giving to other people, do you sometimes feel depleted? 

04:29:15
RANDI Sometimes, um, sometimes. More often I, I feel- 

04:29:20
STEVE ANDREAS It's freely given? 

04:29:20
RANDI Invig- invigorated. 

04:29:25
STEVE ANDREAS Great, wonderful. Do you have a way of knowing at the time which is which? Because some people don't notice until later. 

04:29:30
RANDI Um, at the time- That's a good point. At the time, no. 

04:29:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK let's build this in. 

04:29:40
RANDI OK. 

04:29:40
STEVE ANDREAS I like to build good stuff like this. So think of a time when you gave freely and it was wonderful and, uh, no problem. And then think of another time when you were giving freely but you were somehow depleting yourself or somehow overextending yourself. 

04:29:55
RANDI Mmhm. Got that. 

04:29:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK. And at the time, you noticed a difference between the two. 

04:30:00
RANDI As you're saying it, I now do. 

04:30:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

04:30:05
RANDI When I first thought of it, no but actually yes. 

04:30:05
STEVE ANDREAS Got it. Well sometimes it just takes the right kind of question to get a good answer. So rehearse this a little bit in the future. Go into the future some time, you're interacting with somebody, and first experience the giving, the freely giving, where it's, it's energizing and it feels good to you and it's dancing together. And do that for a little while and notice very clearly how you feel so that you have that fe- ongoing feedback, and you don't have to worry til later to realize you're exhausted or depleted. Because some of what you may be asking for from other people is something that you gave away yourself. 

04:30:45
RANDI Mm. 

04:30:50
STEVE ANDREAS And there is that interaction that's nourishing to both people, both people are feeling invigorated and, and energized, and then there's other kinds of interactions that don't have that happy outcome. So now imagine that you're in one of those other ones that is not so happy. 

04:31:05
RANDI Yeah. 

04:31:05
STEVE ANDREAS And notice what you're feeling, notice Oh I'm feeling drained, and then you don't have to tell me what you do, but somehow get yourself out of that situation. You know, I have to go to the bathroom, or uh, I've got to do this, I've got to do that, or something like that. 

04:31:25
RANDI Yeah, I've got that. 

04:31:25
STEVE ANDREAS Or, you might have some way of changing that interaction so that it becomes nourishing to both of you. Interrupt them, start on a new track or whatever. 

04:31:40
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:31:40
STEVE ANDREAS Can you think of some things you could do like that? 

04:31:40
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:31:40
STEVE ANDREAS Because there might be some contexts where just disappearing wouldn't work very well. Be repercussions from, in the future of something like that, if it's a boss or a relative or something. 

04:31:55
RANDI Clients. 

04:31:55
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:31:55
RANDI Yes. 

04:31:55
STEVE ANDREAS Well definitely the client you want to energize them, so you wanna... 

04:32:00
RANDI Just joking. Yes. 

04:32:00
STEVE ANDREAS You wanna change, change course, right? 

04:32:00
RANDI Uh huh. Mmhm. 

04:32:05
STEVE ANDREAS That make sense to you? 

04:32:10
RANDI Yes it does. Mmhm. 

04:32:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK at this point do you have any questions? 

04:32:15
RANDI Um, um, my only question would be, I think I could access this. I think I could. 

04:32:30
STEVE ANDREAS Could what? 

04:32:30
RANDI Could access this, so I guess my question would be, What if- How can I be sure that I can access this again? 

04:32:40
STEVE ANDREAS Well, one of the best ways is practice. And practice you can do in imagination, or you can do it in real life. And the real life is important as part of it, but amazingly if you do a lot of it in imagination it can be even better sometimes, than in real world. Because you can rehearse many many opportunities in a very short time. You can run little scenarios about, uh, being in a situation and handling it one way and then you can put that tape aside and run another scenario, run another one, run another one. Put yourself in one of them right now. Let's test- put yourself in one of the worst situations where you'd really fall into the hole in the past. Imagine one of those is going to happen next week. Then go into next week and just try it out, find out what happens, without trying to intentionally do anything. Just find out what happens. 

04:33:45
[sil.] 

04:34:00
RANDI Yeah, I'm just getting an image of climbing out, climbing out... 

04:34:05
STEVE ANDREAS You're getting an image of a climb? 

04:34:05
RANDI Climbing out of that... 

04:34:05
STEVE ANDREAS Oh climbing out, OK. So you did slip in briefly? 

04:34:10
RANDI Yeah, mmhm. 

04:34:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:34:10
RANDI I knew exactly where that, where that was, what that was, and I could climb out. 

04:34:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Well I'm very glad you can climb out. I'd rather that you also didn't slip in. What could we do so that you have advance warning of something, Oh here's one of those situations coming up. Here's where I used to get stuck, here's where I used to fall into the hole, and we simply skim over the hole or sideways or take a different path in some way. Do you know what the clues are? When you'd be about to get sucked into the black hole? 

04:34:45
RANDI Yeah. 

04:34:50
STEVE ANDREAS Well, I put in the black. I'm sorry, the deep hole, the big hole. 

04:34:50
RANDI Uh huh. Yeah I do. Mhm. 

04:35:00
STEVE ANDREAS What other path can you take, and I don't need to know the content. But do you have another path you can take so that you can- You know, it's like driving down a road. 

04:35:10
RANDI Yeah. 

04:35:10
STEVE ANDREAS You see a barrier up ahead, you know you're going to have to veer off to the side or go crashing through the endzone or whatever. As long as you have some way of noticing at least a little bit ahead of time or possibly when you just begin to slide into the hole. Go oops! 

04:35:30
RANDI Mm. 

04:35:30
STEVE ANDREAS This isn't gonna work. Let's go a different direction. 

04:35:40
RANDI Yeah. 

04:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS You got something like that? 

04:35:40
RANDI Got it, mmhm. 

04:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Test this one out. 

04:35:45
RANDI OK. 

04:35:45
STEVE ANDREAS Same situation or similar situation that could happen in a week from now with another client or somebody else or something... 

04:35:50
RANDI It's really not a client. 

04:35:55
STEVE ANDREAS Huh? 

04:35:55
RANDI Wouldn't be a client. 

04:35:55
STEVE ANDREAS Wouldn't be a client. OK, well whatever. Just check it out. Find out what happens. And tell me which it is. Do you get the advance notice and you go- go off to the side? 

04:36:10
RANDI Mm. 

04:36:10
STEVE ANDREAS Or do you start to slip in and go off to the side. 

04:36:15
RANDI Well interesting, the, the image that I have is that, that kind of floorboard... 

04:36:20
STEVE ANDREAS Uh huh. 

04:36:20
RANDI Is over the top of the hole. 

04:36:20
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:36:20
RANDI So there's like little, little gaps but I, not enough room for me to get back in the hole. 

04:36:30
STEVE ANDREAS There's not enough room. So the gaps aren't big enough for you to slide in? 

04:36:30
RANDI Mm-nn. There's the floorboard is... 

04:36:35
STEVE ANDREAS Great. 

04:36:35
RANDI Just over the hole. 

04:36:35
STEVE ANDREAS So you don't even need to get into the hole. 

04:36:35
RANDI Mm-nn. 

04:36:40
STEVE ANDREAS Now for some weird reason you did slide in the hole, you know how to get out, right? 

04:36:45
RANDI Yeah, I, I, there's enough room for me to climb out. 

04:36:45
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:36:45
RANDI But I'd have to really work it. I'd have to really work it going back in there. I'd have to move the floorboard actually I think. 

04:36:55
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Well let's not do that piece of work. IS that all right? You wanna go back in the hole? 

04:37:05
RANDI Not real- not really. 

04:37:05
STEVE ANDREAS You sure? 

04:37:05
RANDI Mmhm. Yeah, no, not really. 

04:37:10
STEVE ANDREAS OK. Now, we've had you test this out in the real world. Is there anything that would keep you from just doing what you've been doing here out in real life? 

04:37:20
RANDI Um. 

04:37:20
STEVE ANDREAS I mean you know if you got knocked out with Seconal or something like that, that would be a different situation, but... 

04:37:25
RANDI Yeah um, well yeah I think I can answer that because- So it all makes sense to me right now and right here and, and I could probably do it- I could do it in the real world, and then I, maybe there were times where I just, I just don't... 

04:37:45
STEVE ANDREAS Maybe you get a little lazy? Or is it just... 

04:37:50
RANDI I get a little, um... 

04:37:50
STEVE ANDREAS Careless? 

04:37:50
RANDI Yeah I would say, I would say, um, I don't, I don't act on what I know I could do. 

04:38:00
STEVE ANDREAS You don't what? 

04:38:00
RANDI I don't act on what I know I could do. 

04:38:00
STEVE ANDREAS Act on what you know you can do. 

04:38:05
RANDI Yeah. 

04:38:05
STEVE ANDREAS What could we, how could we make this second nature? So that you know, there are certain things we do, we just get up and we put on our shoes and we brush our teeth and you don't even think about it. 

04:38:15
RANDI Right. 

04:38:15
STEVE ANDREAS Unless somebody says did you brush your teeth this morning, and then you go Oh yeah I guess so. How could you make it second nature like that for you? 

04:38:25
RANDI Um... 

04:38:25
STEVE ANDREAS By the way, Freud said to, he wanted to make the unconscious conscious. I want to make the conscious unconscious. If you think about your peak moments, your, your, your best moments of your life, whether it's the work you're doing or a nice interaction with somebody else. Are you doing it consciously and deliberately? No, you're doing it spontaneously. The, uh, flow-state, things are happening, you're responding to, uh, what's coming from outside. And you're responding freely and you're not going, well let's see. What should I do? Should I smile here or not? You know, that's a, that's a recipe for disaster. Uh, so I want to make things as unconscious and automatic as possible. With the proviso that you can notice if things don't work out well, then it's time to go back and, and re-sequence things. So how could we make this totally automatic for you? 

04:39:15
RANDI Um, I'm hoping you can help me with that. 

04:39:20
STEVE ANDREAS Well, there are all kinds of ways to do it. Um, one guy had a little gestapo voice in his head. And when he didn't do something that he, was important to him to do, such as your staying out of this hole thing and he would have this voice in his, in his right ear I think it was that says, Do it! Now! You know it was an order. 

04:39:45
RANDI Yeah that wouldn't work for me. 

04:39:45
STEVE ANDREAS No. OK. But you get the idea. 

04:39:50
RANDI Yeah. 

04:39:50
STEVE ANDREAS Now probably this would work better for you. What if you had a voice in there, probably a female voice, very seductive, saying Wouldn't you like to feel good? 

04:40:00
RANDI Could we make it a man? 

04:40:05
STEVE ANDREAS Sure. Sure, whatever. You choose. It's your brain. 

04:40:15
RANDI Alright, got it. 

04:40:15
STEVE ANDREAS Got it? 

04:40:15
RANDI Could you say that again? 

04:40:20
STEVE ANDREAS Sure, you can use my voice. It's little bit cluttered up right now with my cold. Sure, um, what was it? Wouldn't you like to feel good? 

04:40:35
RANDI Yeah. 

04:40:35
STEVE ANDREAS That good? 

04:40:35
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:40:35
STEVE ANDREAS Would that do it? Make sure you wouldn't forget? 

04:40:40
RANDI That's, that's doing it. 

04:40:40
STEVE ANDREAS You're welcome to my voice. 

04:40:40
RANDI OK. Well thank you. 

04:40:45
STEVE ANDREAS We all have Milton's vo- Milton Erickson's voice in our heads, right? 

04:40:45
RANDI Well thank you very much. 

04:40:50
STEVE ANDREAS Hm? 

04:40:50
RANDI Mm. 

04:40:50
STEVE ANDREAS Or you could hear it in Milton's voice. 

04:40:55
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:40:55
STEVE ANDREAS So let's do one more test. 

04:41:00
RANDI OK. 

04:41:00
STEVE ANDREAS So jump into the future, one of these toughest situations comes in where you would tend to be forgetful. Things that were difficult in the past or so on. You find out how, how it goes. 

04:41:15
[sil.] 

04:41:25
RANDI Yeah, I'm hearing it. 

04:41:30
STEVE ANDREAS You're hearing the voice? 

04:41:30
RANDI Mmhm. 

04:41:30
STEVE ANDREAS And does it get you to do what you need to do? 

04:41:35
RANDI Mmhmm. 

04:41:35
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Well at this point do you have any questions? 

04:41:45
RANDI Um. 

04:41:45
STEVE ANDREAS Would it be alright if they asked you some questions? 

04:41:45
RANDI Sure. 

04:41:45
STEVE ANDREAS With the proviso that you don't have to answer any of them? 

04:41:50
RANDI Sure. 

04:41:50
STEVE ANDREAS OK. So if you have any questions of her, would you go to the floor mic? Otherwise I will have to repeat and I'm very bad at that. And roughly how- Let's do a time check while we're here. 15 minutes? Six minutes? Oh, OK fine. OK, do you have any questions of her? Is that right, is it six minutes to go? OK great. Some of you were looking doubtful and looking at your watch in the front row and I thought, well maybe this is bad information. I like to check information. Oh yes, got a question? 

04:42:30
UNKNOWN So, I have, I have, I have a question generally for the tech, about the technique. 

04:42:35
STEVE ANDREAS That would be for me. 

04:42:35
UNKNOWN I know. 

04:42:35
STEVE ANDREAS OK. 

04:42:35
UNKNOWN Is that, is that alright? 

04:42:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah yeah, let's change it now. You just sit here and listen and hang out and if you have anything to contribute let me know. 

04:42:45
RANDI Thank you. 

04:42:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yes, go ahead. 

04:42:45
UNKNOWN So, um, I was at your workshop, um, last, in, last year in Florida, and you did some techniques with and it seems like it's sort of similar to that. It seems like the idea is... 

04:43:00
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. 

04:43:00
UNKNOWN In the metaphor, you tried to establish um, establish ways that are helpful in the metaphor of helping someone and help you in the brain. It's very- that's what you're doing, right? 

04:43:15
STEVE ANDREAS Uh, I'm sorry, I lost the meaning of that. Can you say it again one more time? 

04:43:15
UNKNOWN It just, it just sounds, it seems to, it seems like a really interesting way in the metaphor of finding symbols or finding fantasies, or I, or just finding resources I guess.... 

04:43:35
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

04:43:35
UNKNOWN That a person can use, and it seems like it was widely transferable, it seemed to me. 

04:43:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. It's a fairly simple straightforward thing. Often metaphor's talked about as, I create a metaphor for her and I deliver a metaphor that has the right pieces and so on and so on. Well I'm not that creative, and I'm not that clever. But if I can get her metaphor and explore it gently with her, find out what is- And I see that the metaphor is how she perceives her situation, not necessarily how the situation is, but the way she perceives it and the way she perceives it will determine what she does or doesn't do in the context to make s difference and get out of the hole and all the rest of it. And by exploring the details of the metaphor, um, and uh, I'm contributing anything that I can contribute just as an option, uh, along the way, but basically exploring the metaphor, leaving the metaphor intact, and changing her behavior. And her behavior means the images she makes, the words that she says to herself, her whole internal world so that she can do something about it, because that's under her control. You all know this one I hope, that there's no point in trying to change something that's out of your control. It's a waste of time and it's tedious and it's depressing and all the rest of it. But there are always some things that are under your control and those are, that's what you can explore in the metaphor, and develop, and then I did, uh, some tweaking and some various other things to make sure that it works well, because first she said, well it kinda works, or well it's better. And you gotta read between the lines. Uh, better means not good enough. Uh, or not enough somehow. Uh, one of the Milton Erickson quotes that has been kind of a mantra for me, uh, recently is, um, Every sentence has implications, and it is the, in the implications that the true work is done. Or something like that, it's not quite right, but it's something like that. It's in- Oh, it's in the implications that the important messages are given. Now implications are both verbal and non-verbal, but it's interesting that the best resource I know for Erickson is the Three Conversations books, Conversations with Milton Erickson. Jay Haley and, uh, John Weakland. Because they're, Milton himself is talking about how he works. And on every other page, on average is the work implication. And yet, I've seen, uh, very little about it in the Ericksonian literature and so on about implications, how you create them, how do you determine them, how do you notice them? And, uh, it's a whole area I've explored a little bit. I've got a couple articles on my website and by the way I have a handout. I don't have enough for all of you, so if you are with someone else, uh, please just take one, and, uh, when we're done I'll leave them up on the table there and you can...I have a website, yeah. And the handout is, the handout is, should be on the Milton Erickson website. But here's a hard copy. I like to make sure, because a lot of people don't consult the handsite, um, the website. What is that? The quote? Every sentence has implications. And it is in the implications that the important messages are given. It's very close to that, it may not be perfect. Any other questions? How much more time do we have? About out of time? OK, well, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. 

04:47:25
RANDI Thank you very much. 

04:47:25
REID WILSON So, this must be important to you. 

04:47:30
UNKNOWN It is. 

04:47:30
Reid Wilson, PhD 

04:47:30
REID WILSON Yeah, because you volunteered to come up here and be courageous, so thank you for doing that. So can you say a little bit about what's going on that's brought you up here? 

04:47:45
UNKNOWN Uh, about a little over two years ago I went to a dental appointment and, uh, in the process the- process of the appointment the, uh, dentist ground off the back of a crown that had been hitting my lower teeth, uh, for a while and, uh, I had told the prior dentist that, you know, this was a problem but he just ignored it and now this new dentist said, Oh geez. And without even discussing it with me he ground off the back of the tooth and the moment he did, my jaw shifted and changed. 

04:48:20
REID WILSON Just- Can- Just for a moment, without even discussing it me, what, what are you implying from that, saying that? 

04:48:30
UNKNOWN What am I implying? 

04:48:30
REID WILSON Without even asking me he ground it off. What, what meaning is behind that statement? 

04:48:35
UNKNOWN Oh, um, I guess, I guess I thought he should have asked me or talked to me or explained to me something about what he was thinking before he did it. I mean, not that I'm a dentist and I would have known, but at- I guess at the time I, I felt like, uh, well I just felt like he'd done something to me that I didn't even have a chance to know was ha- Was going to happen. 

04:49:00
REID WILSON And so when you think about that specific piece, do you know what the emotion is behind that specific piece, he didn't even ask me? 

04:49:15
UNKNOWN Confusion, anger, you know. 

04:49:15
REID WILSON OK, uh huh, OK. 

04:49:15
UNKNOWN Um... 

04:49:20
REID WILSON I'm sorry to interrupt... 

04:49:20
UNKNOWN No no, that's OK. And so anyways, you know, it, it didn't, I just left the office because I was there actually for dental cleaning and I got hoodwinked into doing this other thing first. So I just left and... 

04:49:30
REID WILSON You said hoodwinked and (inaudible ). Tell me... 

04:49:35
UNKNOWN Well I had actually gone there that day for, um, a dental cleaning and, uh, before they, they at the last minute said no no no no no, you have to have an exam by the dentist before we'll do the dental cleaning. And have all these x-rays taken... 

04:49:50
REID WILSON And so the hoodwinked you mean, what are you implying behind the hoodwinked? 

04:49:55
UNKNOWN They changed the rules on me. They changed the rules. They said one thing and then I got there and they said something else. 

04:50:00
REID WILSON And so the emotion behind that, that very specific thing, I got hoodwinked, is, is what? 

04:50:10
UNKNOWN Um, um, I don't know the words that are popping up, it's just that it was my fault and I'm stupid. 

04:50:20
REID WILSON What about the- So the, the word hoodwinked, makes you- that's what that means? Because I thought it meant something else. 

04:50:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:50:25
REID WILSON Hoodwinked, it sounds like you had an emotion about- When I think about getting hoodwinked, I'm kind of... 

04:50:35
UNKNOWN Blindsided? You know. 

04:50:40
REID WILSON Right, but I'm kind of annoyed, if somebody hoodwinks me or blindsides me, so that's what I'm asking. 

04:50:40
UNKNOWN Well that's true, yeah. I mean, I mean that's why I left, was because I was upset. I was angry. I felt, you know... 

04:50:45
REID WILSON OK, the upset that you had was that you were mad. 

04:50:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:50:50
REID WILSON OK. Go ahead. I hope that it's OK that I interrupt a little, I'm just... 

04:50:55
UNKNOWN No, it's OK, it's OK. Um, so anyways within a few, just within a short time I started noticing I was having a really horrible pain in my ear, was sort of- I used to describe it as a cattle prod, somebody put in my ear and would turn it on at, turn it on periodically. And eventually I discovered that that shift of that little change in my teeth caused me to lose a bite. I have no longer any way for my teeth to touch. They, they make one contact point right here and so when I chew, it's really bizarre. 

04:51:35
REID WILSON Where's, where's the contact point? 

04:51:35
UNKNOWN Right there. 

04:51:35
REID WILSON In the front, the very front. Uh huh. 

04:51:35
UNKNOWN So, um, I had this terrible TMJ problem, this horrible pain, and no longer have a bite. And so I went to a dentist, another dentist, who said to me, Well we're going to have to do eight to 16 crowns in order to get you to have an occlusion back which just sounded absolutely horrifying to me. I can't even imagine the sitting in a chair to have somebody do that. So I've been trying to deal with that piece... 

04:52:10
REID WILSON Particularly because you got hoodwinked into it to some degree, all of a sudden something I didn't have, didn't give permission for is got me... 

04:52:20
UNKNOWN Oh I'm in this horrible... 

04:52:20
REID WILSON This mistake has gotten me to have to... 

04:52:25
UNKNOWN Well that's, yeah. 

04:52:25
REID WILSON What, when you say yeah? 

04:52:25
UNKNOWN Well yeah! Somebody else's mistake has now really destroyed, really destroyed something in my life. You know? It's like, punched a hole through, uh, a part of me that I don't even know what it is, and that was what I was telling you about, with regards to- I'm, I'm like trying to get all this stabilized, going to all these chiropractors, body workers, everybody to try to help my body adapt so that when they put in all these new crowns, um, which feel like to me like somebody's going to amputate, you know, all this in my mouth, and then they're going to put back all these prostheses, and I'm never gonna, you know. It's like I'm losing a part of me. I feel like I'm losing a part of my psyche. And um, anyways so I, I... 

04:53:35
REID WILSON Can I interrupt you again? 

04:53:35
UNKNOWN Yeah it's OK. 

04:53:35
REID WILSON So, um, if you feel hoodwinked, you let me know, OK? 

04:53:40
UNKNOWN OK. 

04:53:40
REID WILSON Because I'm on your team, OK? 

04:53:40
UNKNOWN I know. 

04:53:40
REID WILSON This is collaborative, so. I'm losing a part of me, I got that piece, but there seemed to be another, kind of a psychological, um, what what what do you think is happening psychologically? 

04:54:00
UNKNOWN I feel, um, I feel, well I find myself distracted now. I can't look at my teeth, I look at other people's teeth, when I'm working with patients, I'm like, find myself staring at their mouths. I don't know, I get these thoughts. Like, how do they live with their teeth like that, especially if they look wrong or, you know. I, you know, sit in a movie or I'm watching a TV show and I can't help but keep looking at people's teeth. And, uh, i can't look at mine. 

04:54:40
REID WILSON OK, and do you know what the function is of looking at people's teeth? Are you, do you see something behind that in terms of what drives you to...? 

04:54:50
UNKNOWN I just think that I, I think, aside from like, I look and I say, Oh, my teeth are never gonna be right again. Um, it's... 

04:55:05
REID WILSON So, you look at other teeth in order to remind yourself that it's, yours are never gonna be right again? Let me just, hold still to this particular one. 

04:55:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think that's... 

04:55:15
REID WILSON You, are you doing it like, without any awareness all of a sudden you find yourself looking at people's teeth, or, and underneath that it is to remind yourself that you're gonna have teeth as bad as that? 

04:55:35
UNKNOWN Um... 

04:55:35
REID WILSON And the reason I'm asking... 

04:55:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

04:55:35
REID WILSON That is that if it's something important I don't want to help you get, take that away because it may be useful to you. I've just met you. 

04:55:45
UNKNOWN Mmhm. 

04:55:45
REID WILSON If it's not useful to you, if it's just causing you discomfort then, then maybe we can do something about that. 

04:55:55
UNKNOWN What it does is it reminds me that mine have been destroyed and that I won't ever be...I'm disfigured. It's like so crazy to me, but, uh, that's what happens it's like I look and I go, my teeth are never gonna look the same again and I'm disfigured. 

04:56:25
REID WILSON OK, so I wanna gather a little more information in a different way. 

04:56:30
UNKNOWN Sure. 

04:56:30
REID WILSON So would you be willing to close your eyes for a minute? What I wanna ask you... 

04:56:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

04:56:35
REID WILSON Is when you're ready, you can just let your eyes close. As you're doing that, you're saying some things like what you just said, that I am going to be disfigured. And what I'd like you to do if you can is, and there's nothing you have to say at this moment, but just listen for what I'm asking. As you move back in time, can you get any sense of where this position might have begun, you know the genesis of this, is there anything in your past, your childhood, four years ago, whenever, that might give us some information about why, as you look at other people's teeth, you use that to remind yourself again that the upcoming procedures are going to represent you being disfigured. And just take your time and think about that. If you already know you can say some things to me with your eyes closed and if we have enough information you can open them again, but what, what comes to mind? 

04:57:50
UNKNOWN Well the first thing that came to mind was, um, when I was five years old I broke my left arm and the doctor put the cast on too tight. And it rotted my arm away. 

04:58:00
REID WILSON It rotted your arm away. 

04:58:05
UNKNOWN And they, uh, my mom had to force them to take the cast off because I had all this goop coming up out of my cast. And when they took it off, I had, I had muscle and things that I could see here. 

04:58:25
REID WILSON It sounds to me like that's really easy to recall right now. Is that true, you can... 

04:58:35
UNKNOWN I can see it, I can see. 

04:58:35
REID WILSON OK. And as you scan again, I mean obviously that's incredibly powerful and useful for me to understand. Can you just scan forward in time and see if you know, almost like taking stepping stones into the future? Any other relationships, events, experiences that might also contribute to you at this time saying what's going to happen to repair my mouth and get me back to equilibrium is actually going to disfigure me for life? I'm just talking on and on, allowing you to look around. Any, anything else that you're landing on? 

04:59:25
UNKNOWN Um, the other, the only other thought is just that my mom who raised me, she always, uh, had really bad teeth and, um and when she, when she got cancer, um, it was one of the things they did a long long time ago was that, pull all of her teeth. 

04:59:45
REID WILSON Uh huh, and what does that mean to you? How, how are, what, how's that becoming additive in this whole...? 

04:59:55
UNKNOWN She, she, she always, uh, hated her her false teeth and they were- Mama, she really, uh, she really thought she looked ugly. 

05:00:10
REID WILSON She thought she looked ugly. Uh huh. 

05:00:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:00:15
REID WILSON And how are you resonating to that, as you say it? What do you, what sense are you making at this moment? 

05:00:20
UNKNOWN It, it for whatever reason, it's sort of a silly thing in my family but you know my dad who raised me had lost his teeth in the war and she had these bad teeth that, and uh, I guess, it's just been really important to me in my life to try to take good care of teeth. 

05:00:50
REID WILSON Yes. I... 

05:00:50
UNKNOWN And now I've been destroyed. 

05:00:50
REID WILSON OK. 

05:00:55
UNKNOWN And now I can't help but look at other people and those... 

05:01:05
REID WILSON Good idea to keep breathing. Let's just support what's happening by your breathing. 

05:01:15
UNKNOWN I told you I would wind up crying. 

05:01:15
REID WILSON I, I told you I hoped you would cry, because if I end up sucking at least we'll have emotion on the tape, I...So I'm once again thanking you for your work. Did something come up at that moment? I want to make sure I did not miss anything. You kind of held your breath and... Well if I didn't miss anything I'm OK but was there something there that you wanna let me know? 

05:01:50
UNKNOWN I'm just, I'm, I just, I don't have any choice about what I have to do. 

05:02:00
REID WILSON You don't have any choice. 

05:02:05
UNKNOWN No. 

05:02:05
REID WILSON And what does that mean to you? 

05:02:05
UNKNOWN It means that no matter what, if I'm ever going to be able to chew my food again, I'm going to have to go through all these procedures and whatever procedures I go through, not only do I have to endure them but I also have to be willing to accept whatever is left that no longer will, you know it just doesn't look like me. And, um... 

05:02:40
REID WILSON You're anticipating it not looking like you. 

05:02:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:02:45
REID WILSON OK. 

05:02:45
UNKNOWN And I, I just kinda had this, you know, and I realized something this last year is that I'm, um, a pattern person. I, I, I sort of memorize patterns, and it's just such a pattern disruption for me to even look at my own mouth. And, and, and now it's just become I don't look at my mouth, I just look at my patients. I look at movie stars and I go through these, these machinations in my brain. 

05:03:20
REID WILSON So, I'm, I'm a little confused and if keeping your eyes closed is OK with you, because I want to ask you something a little more age progressive in a moment, but you keep saying I don't look at my mouth. And yet, it certainly seems like you're, you're quite preoccupied with your mouth. So can- Help me understand that a little bit. I don't look at my mouth but yet you keep talking as though, you know, my mouth's going to be destroyed. And so what's your understanding of, of that? 

05:04:00
UNKNOWN Um, I think it's, it's why it's like disfigured in my brain, is that it no longer looks the same. My teeth have all altered and... 

05:04:10
REID WILSON They've already changed? Is that what you're saying? 

05:04:15
UNKNOWN They, they, they change just because they moved. 

05:04:15
REID WILSON OK. 

05:04:15
UNKNOWN And, um, they, they don't, the crowns that they put on, um, are wrong and so my brain just kind of looks and it's wrong and I can't look at it. 

05:04:35
REID WILSON So they've done some crowns? They haven't done all these procedures yet. 

05:04:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, these, the crowns that were done are the ones that actually created the problem. 

05:04:40
REID WILSON OK. 

05:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:04:45
REID WILSON So I don't look at my teeth and yet I do look at my teeth. 

05:04:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

05:04:45
REID WILSON I do them in my mind. OK. I understand that. I wanna go back in time for again, to understand after that horrible experience at five, can, can again stepping stones forward. How did- In what other ways has that influenced you as you've grown up? And as you were younger, what, what did it do for other experiences and perceptions? 

05:05:10
UNKNOWN Well it was certainly really hard when I was young, because they, the doctor couldn't sew anything, so he just bound my arm up like this. And, uh, and left it to grow itself together, so I had this, and I still have a scar here, but I had this, you know very ugly reddish looking scar, and I spent most of my life being afraid of wearing anything short-sleeve as a kid, because as you know kids would just, um, you know horribly point it out and... 

05:05:50
REID WILSON Kids can be cruel. 

05:05:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:05:50
REID WILSON Adults can be cruel. They can hoodwink you. As you grew older, were there other ways that what happened to you at five influenced how you responded to events or determined actions that you took, or...? 

05:06:15
UNKNOWN I don't, um, I don't think so. I mean, other than it, you know, at some point I decided that it was unreasonable for me to wear long-sleeved shirts all the time. That I wasn't going to allow it to, um, be something I fixated on. But... 

05:06:35
REID WILSON Oh now, I'm going to ask you to tell me more about that. You decided what? 

05:06:40
UNKNOWN I decided that I wasn't going to fixate on it, that it was going to, you know, it was just going to be a part of my arm and I would say, it's a part of my arm and it has feeling and, you know, and it belongs to me. 

05:06:55
REID WILSON Are- I'm a little about how you could do that. How, how you could turn that around and say, I'm not going to get fixated on it and I'm going to decide that it's part of me. Can you help fill that in a little bit? It must have been, it wasn't just a snap leap to that place, or was it? 

05:07:20
UNKNOWN No, I mean... 

05:07:20
REID WILSON How did you do it? 

05:07:20
UNKNOWN I would just, I would look at it, I would look at it and I would, um, just touch it, you know and, and realize it had sensation. 

05:07:40
REID WILSON And so, if it's OK with you, you can let your eyes open again. So, and how long ago did you figure out that? Did something happen to make you feel like I'm, I've had it with this? 

05:07:50
UNKNOWN No I think it's just sometime, you know, maybe my teenage years. 

05:07:55
REID WILSON From your teenage years? OK. 

05:08:00
UNKNOWN Yeah it was a long time. 

05:08:00
REID WILSON And so, since you've been an adult, it feels pretty integrated to you? OK. 

05:08:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:08:05
REID WILSON Help me understand how it's going to be impossible to do that again? 

05:08:10
UNKNOWN I dunno. 

05:08:10
REID WILSON I'm sorry. 

05:08:10
UNKNOWN I dunno. I don't know how it will be impossible. 

05:08:15
REID WILSON Well see what you can do to, see what you can do to explain how it would, would be impossible to do it again. 

05:08:20
UNKNOWN You mean with my teeth, you know? 

05:08:25
REID WILSON Mmhm. I guess I could sit there and rub them. [ 

05:08:25
UNKNOWN 05:08:30]Uh... 

05:08:25
REID WILSON What are you laughing about? Do you know how terrible this is? 

05:08:35
UNKNOWN I know how terrible it is. 

05:08:35
REID WILSON Yeah. And so what are you laughing about? I'm asking you sincerely. 

05:08:40
UNKNOWN I know, I just keep trying to find a way to work through it. 

05:08:45
REID WILSON Yeah, but what do you- Why did you laugh? let's just hold still around that moment. You rubbed your and yeah, and you laughed. Tell me about that, at that moment. Don't let it get too far away. 

05:08:55
UNKNOWN No I won't. 

05:09:00
REID WILSON I know, I know your primary response. What, what does that mean? 

05:09:05
UNKNOWN It just seems sort of goofy that I have to, I don't know, it feels infantile. 

05:09:10
REID WILSON What does? 

05:09:10
UNKNOWN Starting all over with something and trying to identify a part of me again as, as belonging to me. 

05:09:20
REID WILSON So are you saying you laugh because you think it's ridiculous to think that you'd be able to pull that off again? That you were so much more competent back then as a teenager then you are now and you've got...I'm just, just trying to understand, trying to understand. 

05:09:40
UNKNOWN I honestly don't know but I appreciate... 

05:09:40
REID WILSON Well I don't either. 

05:09:40
UNKNOWN I love the way you, I love the tone of your voice, as you tell me all of this. 

05:09:50
REID WILSON I'm confused what you're appreciating. Explain, explain to me what you're appreciating. 

05:09:55
UNKNOWN I don't know but I know that I have no choice but to figure out how to get this. 

05:10:00
REID WILSON Let me interrupt you again. You totally have a choice. 

05:10:05
UNKNOWN Really? 

05:10:05
REID WILSON You can stay fu- uh, messed up for- You can, you you certainly have the ability to remain the way you are now, where you feel like it's impossible to change and your body has been, will be deformed and it will never be the same. And you mouth is ruined. You, you totally have the ability, and you know it. That you can stay just as you were when you walked up here, right? So you have a choice. Do you have any sense of what kind of choice you want to make? Because I'll try to help you as long as I know what choice you want to make with the time we have. That's, I'm here to serve you, so what choice would you like make about this very very serious problem? And I know it is, I'm not, you know, we're trying to alter perception, but in no way are you or I going to diminish what's in front of you. How, what choice do you want to make, even if you're not sure that you can make it about this? 

05:11:25
UNKNOWN Well I'd like to be able to stop fixating on the way other people look and their teeth. I'd really like to stop doing. And, uh... 

05:11:40
REID WILSON So that's what you don't want to do. 

05:11:40
UNKNOWN Yeah I don't want to do that. 

05:11:40
REID WILSON What, what do you want to do? 

05:11:45
UNKNOWN Um. 

05:11:45
REID WILSON Because that will be an opening. If you don't do that, that gives you an opening. What do you want to do? 

05:11:50
UNKNOWN I want to feel like I'm not going to be disfigured, um, that's another adult- 

05:12:00
REID WILSON That's how you don't want to- that's how you don't want to view yourself. 

05:12:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:12:00
REID WILSON How do you want to view yourself? I tot- I totally get what you're saying... 

05:12:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:12:05
REID WILSON But let's, don't want to feel, that's I'm just -How do you want to view yourself? 

05:12:15
UNKNOWN I, I want to be able to, um, look like me to me again. I don't know how to say that, um... 

05:12:20
REID WILSON OK so... 

05:12:25
UNKNOWN I want to view, yeah. 

05:12:25
REID WILSON So I'm going to ask you to work on this for a second. 

05:12:30
UNKNOWN Mmhm, yeah. 

05:12:30
REID WILSON I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and, and actually do this, which is go ahead and see yourself as you- hold on, wait. I want you to- Are you going to hold on? So hold, you can breathe, you can have all those feelings, right? But I want you to have this work perfectly right now. 

05:12:50
UNKNOWN OK. 

05:12:50
REID WILSON You're not- this isn't a crystal ball. This is not a crystal ball. This is not how it necessarily is going to go, but I want to make sure you have an outcome picture that you're fighting for. Because you are fighting mad. And if you want this badly enough, I will help you get the energy to get this. So as I'm babbling on, go ahead and start- Give me a nod of your head when you're starting to formulate that sense of the me who I want to see. How- can you put some words on what you see in your mind? And you might get little flashes, little snapshots and things, or, or maybe it's a feeling or I'm not sure. What is your sense at this moment about that? 

05:13:40
UNKNOWN I just look in the mirror and I see my teeth, normal again. 

05:13:45
REID WILSON OK, is that conceivable that you'll have the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror and have normal face? 

05:13:55
UNKNOWN Uh, I think I'm afraid it won't happen. I'm afraid that- 

05:14:00
REID WILSON Don't, don't, don't care about that right now. I care about that part. 

05:14:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:14:05
REID WILSON Not worried about that. 

05:14:05
UNKNOWN Is that normal? 

05:14:05
REID WILSON What I'm asking you, do you, is it conceivable, given what is going to happen, physically, that there are going to be procedures, is it conceivable that someone in your shoes would be able to look at themselves in the mirror and see a normal, fully integrated adult who has worked all her life to be as fully integrated as she can be. Is it conceivable that an adult in your circumstances, stepping into those shoes, can see herself as normal? Just seeing if it's- you can buy into the possibility of an adult reaching that point, and see if you can get an image of yourself that reflects that ability. Tell me what you're noticing, and if you need more time, just tell me. 

05:15:10
UNKNOWN I'm noticing two things. One is I keep seeing the picture of me as normal and I keep hearing the voice inside saying it's not gonna be possible. 

05:15:20
REID WILSON OK. Well fine. You wanna open your eyes for a minute? So is that OK? Just at this moment. Is it OK to have a part of you inside that says that's not possible. Who are we kidding? We're not doing magic up here. 

05:15:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:15:35
REID WILSON You- you've got a major set of procedures that will be uncomfortable and difficult and time consuming and then there's a number of adjustments and appointments to get things to fit again. And so, we don't, I think, you tell me, we don't need to get rid of the part of you that feels pessimistic, isn't confident that you're gonna get these changes, do we? 

05:16:10
UNKNOWN You know, probably not, because then maybe that part will be able to, uh, access or analyze or you know, be a questioner to the process and keep asking questions. 

05:16:25
REID WILSON You mean the part of you that feels like it's not gonna happen? 

05:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:16:30
REID WILSON OK. But you know really it's almost like hey come on over here behind my skirt, and you just hold on to my leg, and we will get through this. I'm sorry this has happened to you but I'm going to be the executive here and I'll take care of these things... 

05:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah 

05:16:45
REID WILSON And it's OK if you're scared and you know, because right now a lot of this is anticipatory dread. Plus you have a hole belief system based on horrible trauma. So how are you viewing yourself now about your arm? Just remind me again. 

05:17:05
UNKNOWN Well it belongs to me. it's not, you know, it's got sensation and it's, you know, works just fine. It's normal. 

05:17:15
REID WILSON OK so I don't have to be over here putting something inside you that you don't already have. We, we just need to embellish what you did at a relatively young age, I, I think. And I know you feel skeptical about it, um. And even if you accomplish this, you get to go through all this other torment every once in a while. You know Christopher Reeves and you know his whole story, and what an optimistic, you know. But I read and interview with him and he said, you know basically every morning I wake up and cry for 45 minutes. 

05:18:00
UNKNOWN Mm. 

05:18:00
REID WILSON To start my day. So we're not looking for, you know, magic here. Now let's address other specific things that you think you're concerned about, or you're not going to be able to accomplish regarding all of this. I have a couple of things in my head but tell me what you're thinking at this moment. 

05:18:20
UNKNOWN Well I'm, I, uh, um, don't co- don't, I, uh, I'm not forceful enough in pursuing the dentist that has been helping me. 

05:18:40
REID WILSON I'm not being forceful enough about pursuing the dentist that's been helping me. OK, what does that mean? 

05:18:45
UNKNOWN Well, he, he wound up having to have a shunt put in his brain, and so it really kind of screws up the process. 

05:18:55
REID WILSON And so what do you mean you're not being forceful enough to pursue...? 

05:19:00
UNKNOWN You know, he's, I'm concerned about his capacity at this point in time. 

05:19:05
REID WILSON This is the dentist who's going to do the repair work? 

05:19:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, the one, the one person I've trust. 

05:19:10
REID WILSON OK so what will, and when you say I'm not being forceful enough to pursue, what would you be doing if you were feeling forceful? 

05:19:15
UNKNOWN If I were feeling forceful... 

05:19:20
REID WILSON Regarding pursuing. 

05:19:20
UNKNOWN I would, I would call- His wife works with him, and I would call and I'd say, Carol, um, I'm really confused about, you know, why we're not being able to set up this appointment. Because I fly from New Mexico to California to see him. And, uh, I don't know if he's not well enough now. Uh, I don't know what's going on and she's not very forthcoming. 

05:19:45
REID WILSON OK so... 

05:19:45
UNKNOWN They just don't set up the appointment. 

05:19:45
REID WILSON I'll interrupt you and see if I know, understand what you're saying. It's like well let's get going, I've got stuff to do here. I've got miles to walk before I sleep and I'm not just going to piddle away time being passive in response to someone else's passivity. 

05:20:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:20:00
REID WILSON Never going to beat passivity by being passive, right? So you're sensing I need to go ahead and get this going. 

05:20:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I've been just holding back because I don't know what the disconnect is, and I think I'm part of the disconnect that's... 

05:20:15
REID WILSON What, I didn't understand that. I've been holding back because...? 

05:20:20
UNKNOWN Um, the disconnect in terms of actually, us, me getting another appointment with them and having them look at this and there's some reason and I think I'm part of it. I'm part of the reason because I'm reluctant. I don't call and hound them all the time. I call them and I say Hey, let me know, I can come out, you know, any time in these next two months just tell me when and I'll be there. And then I don't hear back from them and you know. So then I go OK, I'm just going to be real passive about this. And then I... 

05:20:50
REID WILSON I haven't suffered enough, let me spend a few more weeks just in, yeah, OK. But also there's another, I think, from what you said here is, if I actively pursue this, I'm actively pursuing destroying myself. And that's, to you, just seems- I, I don't want to participate in it, because my perception is that I'm destroying myself. 

05:21:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:21:15
REID WILSON What are you going to do about that? 

05:21:20
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

05:21:20
REID WILSON OK. 

05:21:20
UNKNOWN I mean I really, you know, you're really right. Because that's, it's sort of, it's sort of like being that guy who fell in the hole and he laid there for weeks with his arm caught in that boulder. You know, and it's like, you know, he kept hoping and waiting, that something else would happen so that he wouldn't have to do that. And I just keep hoping that my teeth will move back into place, or... 

05:21:50
REID WILSON Well, that's a different story here though. 

05:21:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:21:50
REID WILSON This is not analogous to your situation. He, he, you and I probably agree, he did what he nee- he was... 

05:22:00
UNKNOWN Eventually he did, yeah. 

05:22:00
REID WILSON Needed to have done, right, and I don't think he was passive, waiting around. I think he was going ehh- So, but, so, what do you think about charging ahead and going ahead and destroying? Well, listen. 

05:22:15
UNKNOWN No, it's right, you're right. 

05:22:15
REID WILSON You, you know you got a choice between- I don't want to actively participate in destruction, so I'm going to passively not participate. I'm going to pa- and that feels constructive to me but it is not. Your choice right now is not between being destructive and being constructive, it's not. It's between being active or being passive. And you have to participate in actively destroying something to, to create who you're going to participate in that. Isn't that the image that you have? If you can start seeing that. I don't, I don't mean to lecture you... 

05:23:05
UNKNOWN No. 

05:23:05
REID WILSON But it's like... 

05:23:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:23:10
REID WILSON Come on! Let's do that! I mean, let's get behind doing that. Would that be OK with you? To, I mean, the executive in you's like, I don't want to do it but so how aggressive do you need to be? 

05:23:25
UNKNOWN I need to just call them and, and say, you know, made an actual date. 

05:23:30
REID WILSON Let me rephrase my question because I don't, I don't care about the details. 

05:23:30
UNKNOWN OK. 

05:23:35
REID WILSON How, how strong do you have to be about pursuing the destruction? I'm, I'm sorry but we... 

05:23:40
UNKNOWN No, I know. 

05:23:45
REID WILSON Should perceive it like that. Because you have to do the destruction to do the reconstruction. And you are going to reconstruct yourself and you- Because you said, you're not going to stay stuck. It's going to happen. Now, are you going to remember that you've done this before and you can do it again? I'm, I'm so sorry you're having to go through this. I'm sorry you got hoodwinked, right? So what do you think about- This is a major confrontation that I'm, I'm having with you right now, which is I'm telling you, you have to participate in destruct- in destruction. You gonna wrap your mind around that? Not only do you have to actively participate in destruction, you have to carry that younger part of you that is terrified around this. You have to carry her with you, because you have to be the holding. Alright? You have to be the holding of that part of you too. That's a lot of work. You up for it? 

05:24:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:24:55
REID WILSON Are you? 

05:24:55
UNKNOWN Get an injection. 

05:24:55
REID WILSON I'm sorry? 

05:25:00
UNKNOWN Have you got an injection that'll just... 

05:25:00
REID WILSON What does that mean? 

05:25:00
UNKNOWN It means that it could just be quick and easy. 

05:25:05
REID WILSON No. 

05:25:05
UNKNOWN No. 

05:25:05
REID WILSON Sorry. 

05:25:10
UNKNOWN Doesn't work that way. 

05:25:10
REID WILSON Ac- Well I think actually it's back in North Carolina. 

05:25:10
UNKNOWN Is it? Is that where you left it? 

05:25:15
REID WILSON Sorry. And it cost 49.95. 

05:25:15
UNKNOWN They wouldn't let you take it on the airplane. Right. 

05:25:20
REID WILSON So. 

05:25:20
UNKNOWN OK. 

05:25:25
REID WILSON Yes or, yes or no? 

05:25:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

05:25:25
REID WILSON You would like to do that? Alright, yes? 

05:25:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

05:25:30
REID WILSON Yeah. Well how are you going to have yes next week? How are you going to have yes when you walk out of here? You know, I don't want to demand characteristics of the, of the pressure of this situation for you to be going, Yes, I would like to help you lock it in if... 

05:25:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:25:45
REID WILSON If we're on the same page around this crazy idea of I've got to actively destroy. You shake your head. 

05:25:55
UNKNOWN I know. Because it's really what I... 

05:25:55
REID WILSON Would you try nodding your head? Could you try nodding your head? 

05:26:00
UNKNOWN I have to actively destroy. 

05:26:00
REID WILSON OK. Do you, does that feel to some degree congruent? Some part of you? Gets it? 

05:26:05
UNKNOWN I understand. Yes. Yes. 

05:26:05
REID WILSON I don't want you mouthing the words. 

05:26:10
UNKNOWN No no no no no, you're fine, you're- We're doing good. 

05:26:10
REID WILSON Oh thank god, I'm fine. OK. Thank you. I knew, I knew when my pen started to roll off my clipboard and you went to grab it that you would help take care of me. And I do once again thank you. 

05:26:25
UNKNOWN You're welcome. 

05:26:25
REID WILSON So even though you laugh at me, I don't mind, really. So, so let's focus on what else, how else can I serve you up here? 

05:26:35
UNKNOWN OK. 

05:26:40
[sil.] 

05:26:45
UNKNOWN Um, it isn't, this isn't the first time I've had to actively destroy something in order to carry forward. 

05:26:55
REID WILSON Oh, tell me more. 

05:26:55
UNKNOWN Oh, you know, I wanted to- I went whitewater rafting and I don't swim and I'm terrified of the water and it was a three day trip down the Colorado River. And I was sick the whole nice before on the beach and they wouldn't let me back out of it and I rode down the river and by the end of three days I was a confirmed river-runner. 

05:27:20
REID WILSON And what were you destroying in order to get there? 

05:27:25
UNKNOWN My fear that, uh, well my fear that I was going to die, for one. Um... 

05:27:35
REID WILSON Oh, so you had to actively risk destruction. Is that what you're saying? 

05:27:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, Yeah. 

05:27:35
REID WILSON OK. Mmhm. 

05:27:40
UNKNOWN Um. 

05:27:40
REID WILSON Any other examples of actively destroying, so we know that you know how? 

05:27:45
UNKNOWN No. 

05:27:45
REID WILSON Ever had relationships that you actively...? 

05:27:50
UNKNOWN Destroyed? 

05:27:50
REID WILSON Yeah. Well... 

05:27:55
UNKNOWN No no no no... 

05:27:55
REID WILSON Fair question. 

05:27:55
UNKNOWN That's a fair question. I'm trying to, I'm trying to... 

05:28:00
REID WILSON I don't need any details about it. 

05:28:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

05:28:00
REID WILSON Yeah? 

05:28:00
UNKNOWN My... 

05:28:00
REID WILSON Something came up? 

05:28:00
UNKNOWN Just came up, yeah. 

05:28:00
REID WILSON What? 

05:28:05
UNKNOWN My, my sister. She's- I have a strange family unit, so let's just call her my sister and uh, she spent years telling me how I'm worthless and no good and how I'm not her sister which is technically true. Um, and I finally just said, Um, fine. At fifty-some years old I just said, fuck you, I'm done. I give it up. 

05:28:30
REID WILSON I don't think you can talk like that on this. 

05:28:30
UNKNOWN We can't say that? 

05:28:30
REID WILSON No. 

05:28:30
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. So that was an actual act, you know I made an intention at that point cause I was tired of being jerked around. And her- It just didn't seem, after 50-some-odd years it was worth it anymore. 

05:28:50
REID WILSON OK, so you built up some of that aggression like... 

05:28:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, it was true, I had to build up the aggression. 

05:28:55
REID WILSON The part of you that's feeling hoodwinked and tricked into something. So that's the same kind of energy, because you do have that energy around this stuff. 

05:29:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:29:00
REID WILSON It's like, I'm not, no way in the world I'm going to let him do this to me... 

05:29:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:29:05
REID WILSON Like what's happened to me before. 

05:29:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:29:10
REID WILSON And so active destruction. You know, what do you think about the principle? 

05:29:15
UNKNOWN Sounds like a, um, a path that I know and I need to find that aggression that is just sort of like the buck stops here kind of thing. 

05:29:30
REID WILSON Yeah. So let's look at something else which is, I look at other people's teeth. 

05:29:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

05:29:35
REID WILSON What do you want to do about that process? 

05:29:35
UNKNOWN Oh gosh, I don't know. That's hard because it's grief. I mean... 

05:29:45
REID WILSON It's grief, OK. Tell me more. 

05:29:45
UNKNOWN I think about it now that we've been talking about it and I look and I say, My teeth used to look like that. They used to be pretty. They used to be even. They used to be symmetrical. They used to be you know, and you know, and I just- And then the people whose teeth fit together wrong, and I, like, you know, I know that because it's functional for them, and I look and I think, their teeth fit together wrong and and how do they live that way is kind of what I ask myself. I don't know why I do these things, but... 

05:30:25
REID WILSON OK, so, I wanna, I'm gonna invite you to consider the possibility that that's not the most efficient way to grieve. Because you're, you're combining grieving with this, my future is going to be awful. And so you're, you're kind of mixing two things, because that's how you talked about it with me. To be honest, I look at them and I go, Well that's how I'm, you know. So, I think at some point down the path, be thinking you can take a hold of that idea of, not sure about this as being my most proud moment of grieving my losses. I think grieving is important to do to try to find one that's more holy grieving as opposed to, I'm grieving and, um, seeing myself with my life is ruined and my body is destroyed and so. So, would that make sense to you only sort of? 

05:31:20
UNKNOWN Only sort of, I mean I'm just sort of, sort of like, it's sort of dropping down through... 

05:31:30
REID WILSON OK so you chew on that, so to speak, when you're able to. 

05:31:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, mmhm, yeah. Thank you. 

05:31:35
REID WILSON That's alright. 

05:31:35
UNKNOWN I choke on things too, nowadays. 

05:31:35
REID WILSON You choke on things? 

05:31:35
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah. 

05:31:40
REID WILSON Oh gosh. Do we need to talk about that? 

05:31:40
UNKNOWN Well, I don't know. I mean that it's scary. 

05:31:45
REID WILSON That choking? 

05:31:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:31:45
REID WILSON Let me go back to the thing around seeing, looking at people's teeth for a minute and then we can talk about that too. And how are we doing? 

05:31:50
UNKNOWN I don't know, I took my watch off. 

05:31:55
REID WILSON OK, so what I want to propose to you is that when I look at people's teeth, that is noise. I don't, this, this is a repetitious, unproductive, anxiety-provoking, stress-provoking event and it's noise. So what I would suggest is that I not label it as part of my grief process. I'm gonna, I'm gonna grieve when I choose to grieve, not when all of a sudden my mind pulls over and has me look at someone else's teeth and then go, right? So, so it becomes noise, and with noise, I can just let that go. Turn away. So wherever you catch it, what's going to happen is you're going to see those people's teeth and then you're going to start going and you're going to start feeling and as soon as you can, step back and go, Oh I'm doing it again. Not doing that and you just let that go. And all that means, let that go means, don't embellish it. You're going to have a reverberation, having gotten set off from it, but you're just not gonna, not gonna go in there. What, does that make sense to you about doing that? 

05:33:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:33:15
REID WILSON What about looking, do you need to do something about looking at your face or your mouth, or is that- are you avoiding something there that you feel like you need to? I'm not saying you do, necessarily, but what are your thoughts? 

05:33:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. I do avoid it, because it's just more comfortable not to look at it. 

05:33:35
REID WILSON But is there any need to look at it? I mean... 

05:33:40
UNKNOWN Need to? 

05:33:40
REID WILSON Yeah, I'm fine with you avoiding looking at it if you feel like- You know, that's OK, I don't have to... You know, if it's like traumatizing me and not really getting me any rest, fine to not pay attention to it. I don't know enough about it all, I'm not saying to... 

05:33:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, no no, you know I think that to what degree even when my arm was as grotesque-looking as it was as a child, there was only so much I could look at it. That's the reason I had to wear long sleeves because not only was it about other people drawing attention to it, you know by going ewww, it was, you know, then it was, it activated me. 

05:34:25
REID WILSON Mmhm, OK. So now a hand went up over there and I want to confirm that that means what, when your hand goes up? Fifteen minutes, OK. So is there something you need to replicate about how that went back then, or can you speed the process up so it doesn't take 10 years? I'm just asking. 

05:34:40
UNKNOWN No it's a good question. I think the, I think that you're, uh, I think that for the time being I need that it be OK, I need to just myself it's OK. I don't have to like, I can... 

05:34:55
REID WILSON What's the it? 

05:34:55
UNKNOWN The it, the it is not looking at my teeth. Is OK. 

05:35:00
REID WILSON OK. And what about looking at other people's teeth and getting set off? And going... 

05:35:00
UNKNOWN That it's noise. I'm going to remember that. It's noise. 

05:35:05
REID WILSON And it's OK that that just happened. 

05:35:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:35:10
REID WILSON Perfectly fine that I keep getting triggered. You know, young women who are having trouble getting pregnant all the sudden get depressed and they can't go visit their cousins because they have babies and they can't go to the mall because there's strollers and so they make some decisions about what they keep- You know, they're going to get set off, and to some degree, Fine, that just happened. And now I- So there's something I want to be make- I want to make sure you and I are doing, which is that you're going to take back control around this and stop being a victim. And I'm not criticizing you about that, I'm just saying I totally get that, but that's why you walked up here, you said, I don't- This is too much suffering for me. How are we doing around having a plan? Rough kind of way. 

05:36:00
UNKNOWN How are we doing around having a plan? 

05:36:00
REID WILSON Of having a plan for, for how things start...? 

05:36:05
UNKNOWN This feels good. Yeah. 

05:36:05
REID WILSON And how are you feeling about all that little laughter stuff, and... Is that OK? 

05:36:10
UNKNOWN Mmhm. My sense of humor is just help carrying me through I guess in life. 

05:36:15
REID WILSON I got one last question about the developmental stuff you said my mother who raised me, my father who raised me and I don't need to know anything about it unless- Is there something relevant here that you expressed it in that manner? And my sister who's not really my sister. Don't need to say anything about that if it has nothing to do with anything that we're talking about, but I just, it stuck in my craw. 

05:36:40
UNKNOWN Well I mean the thing is, um, it's something, for lack of a better term right now I'll call myself adopted. And it's something that I recognize is that as a child I didn't know what I looked like, and... 

05:36:55
REID WILSON I don't know what that means. 

05:37:00
UNKNOWN You don't know what that means? 

05:37:00
REID WILSON As a child I didn't know what I looked like... 

05:37:00
UNKNOWN Because you don't, you don't have a parent who looks like you. 

05:37:05
REID WILSON OK, OK. 

05:37:05
UNKNOWN And so... 

05:37:10
REID WILSON And what did that mean to you? 

05:37:10
UNKNOWN Well what it means is that the things that I came to know about myself through whatever this brain mechanism is, is the kind of stuff that people would notice about me. And my hair and my teeth and my breasts were always the things that were... 

05:37:35
REID WILSON All your assets. 

05:37:35
UNKNOWN That those were the things that were most noted. 

05:37:40
REID WILSON And what happened? 

05:37:40
UNKNOWN And so that's the way I've come to identify me. And, um, you know because it's hard to, I think there's something about these motor neurons and all the rest of the stuff in the brain... 

05:37:55
REID WILSON So you were lost for a while. You couldn't get a reflection for a while. 

05:38:00
UNKNOWN I couldn't see, yeah. 

05:38:00
REID WILSON And you're scared that you're going to lose that reflection again. I totally get that. I totally get that. Is it OK to go through that, right? Like you're going to have to rebuild that too, and of course you're going to feel fragile about that and that seems burdensome to have to do it, but you gonna do it? You going to give the responsibility to someone else? I mean, you gonna not do it? So, so it makes it doubly- I mean, again, why you came up here is to go Why am I having quite so much of a struggle? And so we're getting a clear picture, or I am, and I'm glad I asked you that last question, you know? So, so what you think about having to rebuild some of that identity again and go through the grief around that. What do you think about that? Your willingness to take on that project. 

05:39:05
UNKNOWN It, um, you know, it's something I've been, um, I don't know why, then, you know, it's really sort of made this desire to try to access who my biological parents were. I mean, I have one photograph of them and I pulled it out and started looking at it so that I could start to recognize some other parts of the way my face looked that didn't just focus on things that, um, I had been able to glean identification from, by other people reflecting attraction or interest. 

05:39:50
REID WILSON And how, how many- you have close relationships now in your life? 

05:39:50
UNKNOWN No I don't even... 

05:39:50
REID WILSON You're alone? 

05:39:55
UNKNOWN Oh, you mean close relationships? 

05:39:55
REID WILSON Close friends, and things? 

05:39:55
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

05:39:55
REID WILSON You've rebuilt that kind of community to... 

05:39:55
UNKNOWN Oh yeah. 

05:40:00
REID WILSON Help reflect? So that's going to be... 

05:40:00
UNKNOWN So my best buddies are all my friends from high school still. 

05:40:05
REID WILSON Because... 

05:40:05
UNKNOWN We're still really tight. 

05:40:05
REID WILSON Because I, I pulled one of my good friends aside yesterday and I said to him, I feel so lucky to have you in my life, because as I see you work, and your competence and your warmth and your love and that you love me means so much to me about knowing who I am. That you're in my life helps me know that. That's what I think of when you start talking about those things so I'm glad that you have those people to help you pull through. We're going to stop in a moment- I got one other thing I would like to explore if we can come up with it. And then if there are people who have questions if they want to go ahead and queue up to the microphone they can. So can we come up with a message or two that would reflect what we're talking about doing that you could say to yourself. You don't have to keep these, but is there anything that we've talked about here that you could translate into a very simple little either kind of supportive or motivational or instructional kind of message, like you know, I can do this, or this is gonna happen. I don't know what it would be but do you have some thoughts just some simple ways to carry this home? As well as the complicated ways we're letting you work on. 

05:41:25
UNKNOWN Um, well I guess the words that pop up for me is that, um, I can, I can, the word learn, I can learn to accept, i can learn to accept this. 

05:41:40
REID WILSON Can I give you a friendly amendment? 

05:41:45
UNKNOWN Sure. 

05:41:45
REID WILSON I'm going to learn to accept this. 

05:41:45
UNKNOWN OK. I'm going to learn to accept this. 

05:41:50
REID WILSON You just try that on to see how does that feel. 

05:41:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

05:41:50
REID WILSON I'm just giving the little piece around, getting a little more powerful around. I'm, I'm gonna do this. Again, not a crystal ball. 

05:41:55
UNKNOWN No. 

05:42:00
REID WILSON But I wanna get my heart and mind and soul lined up with this intention. This is my intention. I'm going to learn to figure this out or whatever. 

05:42:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

05:42:10
REID WILSON It's very beautiful. This is the last thing I'll say and then we'll stop if that's OK with you. 

05:42:10
UNKNOWN OK. Thank you. 

05:42:10
REID WILSON Which is a very nice little clip on 60 Minutes. A president of a, of a university, University of Maryland Baltimore County. Done tremendous with the university and what he's done, but he came into a particular class and he was lecturing to them and at the end of the class he says, he does this: Focus, focus, focus. 

05:42:30
UNKNOWN Oh I saw that. 

05:42:35
REID WILSON And all hundred students in the class did it at the same moment with him. Focus, focus, focus. And I just thought, what a rich experience that those kids are already trained to do that and I can imagine them in a situation where they're by themselves and get a little lost and to remember that message. Focus, focus, focus, focus. SO you know I just want to leave you with that idea of come up with something that has that determination and the feistiness that you have inside you and all that you've one in your life that directs you, right? So we want like a head of a pin with a freight train behind it, so. Anything else you want to say before we stop? 

05:43:20
UNKNOWN No, thank you, I appreciate you, um, offering me this opportunity. 

05:43:25
REID WILSON I'm glad you see it as an opportunity. So we'll turn and see if there are any- oh, look, no questions. So great, so if you have a question, if you'd step up, so... 

05:43:40
[sil.] 

05:43:45
UNKNOWN Dr. Wilson, when you had suggested that when she sees other people's teeth that, to remind yourself it's just noise. How do you get people to accept that? Because people who have the same image aren't always able to be settled with, with that... 

05:44:00
REID WILSON Well let's just talk to the people that we have. Um. What do you think of that idea? 

05:44:10
UNKNOWN Uh, I think that it, it produced a, another cognition for me to, you know, to at least substitute, you know, so I have this and that's like, OK this is just noise. This is just noise. It gives me something else to focus on. 

05:44:25
UNKNOWN OK. OK. Thank you. 

05:44:25
REID WILSON I won't go further than that just because we're talking with her. See me after class. 

05:44:35
UNKNOWN I was wondering about the concept of choice as different than have to. So I developed this in working with procrastinators who constantly say I have to but I don't want to and immediately split themselves. And I quite often say there's a third place, there's choice. And choice is an executive brain function. I am choosing to do something and my body doesn't want to. I can choose, I'm using that human function, that choice. 

05:45:10
REID WILSON OK. And are you making a comment, or is there a question behind the comment? 

05:45:15
UNKNOWN Ah yes there's a question there because I was hearing "have to" a lot. 

05:45:20
REID WILSON OK. And, and the...I didn't hear a question. 

05:45:25
UNKNOWN I, I, I was hearing "have to" and with procrastinators especially, it may be a different situation, but with procrastinators have to means I don't want to and creates a conflict and stuckness and I can't move. 

05:45:40
REID WILSON OK. 

05:45:40
UNKNOWN But in fact I can choose surgery. My body doesn't want surgery but I as a human being can choose to do something difficult. I might not want to do my homework but my higher self or some party with a vision or a focus can choose to sit down for 30 minutes and start. 

05:46:00
REID WILSON Yeah I hear all that and agree with all that, and is there a question? Um, I'm fine with there not being a question. 

05:46:10
UNKNOWN Oh oh I'm sorry. So then I heard you using have to quite a bit, and... 

05:46:15
UNKNOWN I think I used have to, didn't I? 

05:46:20
REID WILSON I'm sorry? 

05:46:20
UNKNOWN I think I used have to. 

05:46:20
REID WILSON Yeah I don't remember what I said about have to, so I can't feed it back to you because I was in a light trance the entire time. 

05:46:20
UNKNOWN Alright, thank you. After class then. 

05:46:20
REID WILSON See me after class. OK? So we'll take one last question because I think we stop at quarter of, right? So one last question and then... 

05:46:35
UNKNOWN OK, um, you had, uh, at one point really focused on having her, uh, look at actively destroying herself. You're doing something that was going to be actively destructive. 

05:46:45
REID WILSON Yes. 

05:46:45
UNKNOWN And then I noticed she was the one that prompted that she had done that in the past and something um, had come from that. But I wondered if you had stayed with that idea of her actively destroying herself without- I mean, there seemed to be a pacing with that that I understood, but there, it was, you seemed to be ready to use that as a motivator as opposed to that may be being a process towards reconstruction or another way to think about what was happening. 

05:47:15
REID WILSON Well I would, I would question a couple of things you said. One, you know, actively destroy herself- I wouldn't word it like that. Uh, and I'm not sure I'd say it was motivating. I mean, obviously of course in the end we want it to be motivating. In, in part what I wanted her to have was that concept of, I actually do have to destroy something. And I want to just get behind the idea, even though I don't want to, I', gonna have to, if I want to get my needs met. 

05:47:45
UNKNOWN OK, so that was the thing that you didn't seem to at least initially focus on what it was that she was actually going to be destroying. 

05:47:50
REID WILSON She's going to destroy her teeth to put crowns on. They're going to drill away and scrape away and make little points of her teeth. Don't listen right- Negative hallucination. She's gonna- That's, that's what's going to happen. See me after class. Have a good life, OK?
