DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY The staring point is really with uh… what is PTSD and understanding the impact of trauma on our bodies and our minds and you know, just generally having a sense of what happens to to us, as human beings and I'm going to talk more from the position of just being a human being, which we all are. And I think that's a better starting point than us just thinking about our selves from a clinical perspective. Although that maybe of great interest. The reality is that trauma is the ultimate human equalizer. We all experience things in our lives that can be very, very difficult, umm… clearly, can be potentially devastating. And so, what I really want to do is, spend our time talking about that. Everybody now, knows that I'm Anna Baranowsky and I'm a clinical psychologist and I'm the CEO of the Traumatology Institute.

DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY And really our goal with this organization is to help umm… professionals and volunteers, help trauma survivors. And I'm the author of "Trauma Practice: Tools for Stabilization and Recovery" and "What is PTSD? 3 steps for healing trauma" which just came out last year and uh… we received a lot of good feedback, the first book, I mentioned is really a clinician book and it's uh… geared towards people who are trying to help individuals after trauma, where as "WhatisPTSD? 3 steps for healing trauma" is really a book that is umm… for the general population, people who are trying to understand what they can do for themselves after trauma. And I've dedicated my career to working with Trauma survivors and training professionals, who care for people after Trauma and I developed this presentation for anyone who struggles with the aftermath of Trauma or for the professionals or volunteers who help Trauma survivors or deal with related symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, post- traumatic stress, dissociation and other related difficulties. We have to understand, what happens to our brain after trauma in order to do a good job, of trauma recovery and it's important to recognize that the brain and the body cannot be separated and they correspond perfectly in response, sequence that is orchestrated to aid us in the greatest potential for survival during a Traumatic event. There has been a new classification with trauma, now being identified not as an anxiety disorder umm… and this is because, we understand that, not all traumas result in a fear base response and what does that really mean, now, I work with all a lot of individuals who have military or paramilitary training and in their training what they've done is they have learned, they've recognized, that training kicks in, when they're exposed to major events and that instead of feeling fear, they just start to act and respond to the issue at hand and for other people fear is not what's kicks in at all in the early aftermath, really what kicks in is our survioral mechanism and I'll talk about that coming up shortly. So, with the new changes in Diagnostic Criterion in DSM-5, the prevalence are showing to be lower comparison to DSM-4 and it appears that the primary reason is the removal of PTSD as a result of sudden death of loved one due to natural causes, this was the classification, this was a criterion that was always umm… a little controversial, but now, it has been removed and in fact that may result in a deeper exploration into the issues related to bereavement and grief responses, particularly those that are long tem and complex. So, that's a good thing for individuals who are struggling after the death of a loved one. Another important update is the removal of Criterion two, which is required that individuals have a reaction of fear, helplessness afore, which as I said before isn't always the case. Umm… the DSM Committee did an excellent job of capturing the new criterion now called Negative Alteration in Cognition and Mood, which emphasizes umm… in the self or appraisal and mood begins to worsen, since the Trauma and it includes to dissociative features like uh… negative expectations or distorted blame, uh… negative emotional state, diminished interest or participation in an important life activities, detachment from others and anhedonia which is umm… basically, the inability to experience joy in what we are encountering in life umm… and this often means that people stop doing things that they might have enjoyed previously in life. But, this particular new criterion is a very, very important one, because it really captures uh… uh… something that had been missing, which is this negative alteration and cognition in mood. So, that's a very important one. The continuum of Post Traumatic Stress Responses, and this is important because, I really believe that when we experience the trauma, there is a range of responding from a simulation and growth to severe reaction, and often the type of trauma that we're exposed to determines the level of response. My Trauma doesn't equal your Trauma, which means if you're working with trauma survivors, somebody might come in and tell you a story that you think is quite horrific and of course given that, we're all unique, they may not actually experience or develop PTSD and yet somebody might come in and describe something that you think is manageable and they actually do have the symptoms that are consistent with PTSD and we need to be responding in an honorable way to what we're hearing from our clients, exactly what their story is and the effect on them as an individual. The National Association of State Mental Health Program did a good job of defining trauma as the personal experience of interpersonal violence, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, severe neglect, loss and the witnessing of violence, terrorism and disasters. So, things like motor vehicle accidents, violent assault, and natural disaster, it seems like those things would really classify as a Trauma, right? And do not make sense? But this really simplifies human experience and obliviously there is more to it than that. So, then we have to look at our survival mechanism, which is hard wired in to all of us and it helps us to respond before, during, and after a trauma. You know, having a survival mechanism is actually a good thing, because we need that to keep ourselves well and out of harm's way. So, how does our survival wiring impact Trauma response. As, I mentioned before, Trauma is the great equalizer, because Trauma knows no boundaries of country, race, gender, or any other element that you feel may make you different or the same. And our survival instincts ultimately define trauma, regardless of what you might think about a given event. This is a chemical response in our body and certain parts of the brain live beneath or outside of conscious awareness and respond to these life events. And as a result there is a chemical release that's normal after trauma and result in the body responding directly to the chemicals being released and this is what makes all of this automatic and unconscious. I was working with a client recently and she comes in and she says to me that she just feels, so guilty and so bad that she is not okay, yet and yet so much of her response is really automatic and out of her immediate control. Once she learns how to work through and manage her Trauma symptoms and you know, get control over what's happening with, she will have some choices, but, until she gets that help, until she gets that ability to process through and to deal with the stabilization after a trauma, these reaction, can be so below the surface and so automatic, that we don't have any choice in the moment and you know, I know that everybody sitting in that room understands this because we're all wired the same way. What happens if we add the lens of helplessness into trauma response is that, we immediately recognize that having no ability to out of danger is ultimately traumatic, being unable to escape a trauma results in a biopsychosocial event that engages this self-protection mechanism, automatic, impactful and absolutely in the moment, leaving us feeling that we have no ability to cope. Helplessness engages our natural mechanisms of survival and this is the big impact on our body. One, that's automatic and ignites our entire being and this, the body is now responding by igniting the chemistry of survival fight, flight or freeze. And these chemicals work hard to protect us, helping us to endure we are survived potentially life threatening events. So, sometimes we can umm… experience one thing that isn't actually dangerous, but certainly leaves us sitting at the edge of our seats. There's definitely a benefit to having an automatic response, scanning system for potential threats and the chemical response which allows for rapid responding, that's what we need in place and order for us to get out of harms way. However this can also back fire the same mechanism can mis-interpret information and become reactive, when there's no real threat or in some cases our neuro chemical release. Continues to ignite repeatedly, long after a threat has passed, even years after the threat is gone, we're all potentially at risk of igniting in a self-protective way and in fact this tendency creates habits, that stop being useful, after the threat of trauma is long past. Many of us have habits such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, fear, tension, anger, PTSD, dependency and learned helplessness, which are common patterns associated with exposure to severe traumatic events and can become interrelated habits, undermining out ability to manage everyday life or game and enjoy in day to day activities. So, sometimes we experience Trauma and then no trauma form and it form us, shape us and they change how we are and how we react in our every day life. These habits result in a potentially long term chronic pattern and in physiological changes in our bodies and subsequently in our everyday lives and the very state of fighter flight, that was so important to our survival becomes a habit resulting in chronic conditions and the resulting search for, health for our chronic problems with initially no obvious solutions, even though most of this is ignited by many false alarms or incorrect perceptions of threat. Now, let's think about how the body reacts to Trauma and the part of the brain that controls all of your survival instincts, is the autonomic nervous system, you will see that in pink at the top and there is two branches, Sympathetic and Para sympathetic. And you'll see in the sympathetic side, that's really all about the fighter flight and the Para sympathetic side, it's all about rest and digest. The system will operate automatically and it manages every system in our body, so this is important to consider, because if you work with Trauma survivors frequently what you, what you learn is that, people might start to come with you, your feelings of anxiety, fear, stress, depression also are the symptoms, but they also start to describe body related symptoms as well, so consider this. This is the autonomic nervous system on Trauma and umm… because the autonomic system controls a long list of systems, that truly run our body and when the autonomic nervous system is in a state of automatic fighter flight or fear, response, there's a lot of things that can go wrong, will reflect on all the systems and how there it can become responsive and in a chronic reactive state. Our integrative body, our skeletal body, muscular system, nervous system, endocrine system, that's your hormones, cardiovascular system also knows as your circulate toy system. You know your blood and your heart, respiratory system, the integumentary system, which is, you know, your skin and hair, and nails, your lymphatic and immune system, digestive system, urinary system and reproductive system, boy it's exhaustive. And imagine, if the autonomic nervous system is in charge of all this and it is sending an alarm message that we're in trouble. When the autonomic nervous system engages their survival mechanism of fight and flight, this engages every single system and all the connections between them to prepare for extreme action to get away from danger right now, and we frequently get this wrong, leaving us to plead it. This is particularly an issue, when people have experienced complicated Trauma, the autonomic nervous system managing all of the systems, the tissues and organs and how everything thing works together, you know, every single day of the week, 24/7. So, when the autonomic nervous system says fighter right away, we really want to pay attention, because everything cell and tissue is listening and this is really devastating, when we have PTSD, especially if the body is telling us there's danger, when in fact, there is no danger. Finding balance, when you do manage to get away from danger, is essential to our well-being and we have to recognize that, even if you do manage to get away from danger, then the autonomic nervous system in a perfect world, turns off the reaction and the body returns to a normal state or HOMEOSTASIS, that's balance and that's definitely what we want. We definitely want the balance in the body, in order for us to heal and recover. So, here you see, umm… George(inaudible ) no, no, of course not George. We knew straight away it was a false alarm and here's this person underneath the table and it doesn't look like they that, thought it was false alarm at all. So, when the autonomic nervous system, um… becomes a threat to the body it self, and believe me, this happens all the time with chronic and complex Trauma and often even when somebody is in the early stages, recovering after a trauma. Umm… as it continues that the autonomic nervous system continues to ring in threat were non-exist, under mining over all well-being and reducing the body's ability to return to balance. When the autonomic nervous system is stuck in an instinctively driven fighter flight protection, it leaves all the system struggling for survival underneath the surface. Well, the real problem is the ringing bells and whistles that our associated with that response, instinctive response system or mechanism for survival. What happens, when we don't escape or when the brain and body remains convinced that we remain in danger and this is where the real problem begins and you're gonna see the iceberg on the top and there's loads below the top of the ice berg and I again shown you an image of all these different systems in the body, and how when the autonomic nervous system is ringing, it's impacting everything. So, when your client say they can't rest or they can't digest or they can't think clearly, this is why, the brain and the body begin to drive very hard and very fast, when the mechanism of survival, that fighter flight mechanism is ignited and we're really not designed to be driving hard and fast, all the time. Our bodies are meant to sustain a state of calm, in order (inaudible ) to survive, other wise we start to feel depleted, dead sick, break down, and our lives are just not what they meant to be because, we're over working ourselves. So again, let's talk about this idea uh… of habits becoming chronic conditions and the habits of Trauma, generally lead to patterns that have dramatic, physiological, and psychological impact. And when we have habits associated with trauma, these become chronic and habituated in the body and they become emotional drivers in your life. So, everything that's underneath the surfaces now driving the body. And then we need to think about the habits again and how they lead to patterns that have dramatic effect on our minds, our bodies, our physiology, really, and ultimately all of these shapes. How we function ever single day and create that chronic list of conditions that we now understand is really driven by the autonomic nervous system. Here's a list, it's a very limited list. There are a lot of things on the list but there's so many things I could put on list of a Traumas, all of these things have the power to ignite our nervous system in a fighter flight reactivity and I want you to just ask yourself for a moment, how many of these things might have been part of your life history and how have they shaped you? Because, if you are going to work with people, who have experienced trauma, understanding your own response to Trauma, your personal re-activity can help you tremendously on two levels. One, you begin to understand what it is you need to do to be well, what are the areas of your own vulnerability are, what are your own triggers are, because if you are going to work with Trauma survivors and you have a particular kind of trauma, then, if somebody comes to you with similar history, you may find that scenario of vulnerability, because their trauma can remind you, become a trigger for your own trauma as well. So, this is important from a clinical perspective to understand and uh… recognize our own vulnerabilities as professionals and helpers. So how common is this? Well, it's pretty common actually umm… 70% at least will be exposed to some kind of their life time. Umm… general statistics range from 8% to 25% resulting in PTSD. There was a recent online uh… structured survey in umm… the journal of Traumatic stress, 2013. And they found that 89.7% of individuals in a sample of 2953 expressed multiple trauma exposures in their lifetime and PTSD was endorsed at 8.3% of that online sample. So, it's pretty common, much more common than that was thought in the past. So, it becomes a problem because, old Traumatic memories can easily re-ignite our autonomic nervous system in a response mechanism for survival. Now, just for a moment imagine that you were severely bullied and threatened, when you were much younger, maybe you were in school, maybe at some other point in life and then every time you encounter your boss, who you see as kind of a harsh and demanding person, you feel that your own personal history of bullying gets re-ignited. Now, this is gonna cause trouble or you, because this is a re-ignition, it's like, Trauma is reoccurring in the moment and you feel the same feelings of fear, anxiety and dread, kind of like you did, when you were younger in school and really vulnerable, while you were being picked on or bullied or beaten. So, our history, our past, becomes ignitable in the present. So, there's a predictable pattern of reaction and some of the things that we know, we see consistently, rapid heart rate, shallow breath pattern, elevated blood pressure, strong emotions, anger, fear, anxiety, depression, negative perceptions, remember that one, that's important, withdrawal from normal activities, tension in our fists and jaw, digestive problems and butterflies in your stomach, and poor decision making, chronic pain, stress, tension, dry mouth, clammy hands. You might wonder, how all these reactions are predictable, well, they're universal for all of us because they represent the impact of our state or instinctive survival mechanism on the body. When this becomes chronic response and begins to deplete our ability to cope and to tolerate any further threat perceptions. Lower levels of threat being to result in chronic conditions, so what does that really mean, this is actually something we have to take into consideration, because, now, things might not have bothered us in the past can create a big start (ph) of response and a perception that something is very dangerous or life threatening. Even when we assess it and reflect on it, we realize that it's not. We can feel awful, shaken, and re-traumatized, when we look at this picture that reminds us of a terrible time, even though it's not happening right now. This is a pretty powerful picture, because it shows how the mind stores memories along with motions and how they get locked in the body and that, this can ignite even when we're safe in the moment. Just think about how this makes you feel? What you were doing at the time? Who's around you? And, how others responded, sand especially, what was the look on the faces of the people around you, in this moment? Many of us have uh… very distinct memories of what they were doing in that precise moment. What do we do, to begin to break the habit of nervous system ignition. Cutting edge approaches in neuroscience have helped us to understand that we can harness our natural ability to harness calm and retrain the Autonomic Nervous System or break habits and learn new ones. We know that stabilization exercises must be at the root of recovery, because this is what is required to retrain, body, and the brain. Something we're all wired to do as well. Our bodies allow us to retrain this reactivity that autonomic mechanism for survival, just like we're able to form a habit out of reactivity, we can form a habit of relaxing the body and saying, settling and stabilizing things to reassure our minds. There are a lot of examples of how to achieve this and you know, one another things that I'll talk about in a little while, is some of the things that we created at the Traumatology institute, some simple tools along with the 30 day challenge and some breath training exercises and applications and all, I'll give you an example of that shortly. But first let's think a little bit about the AMYGDALA & HIPPOCAMPUS, because they're both very strongly implicated in what's happening when we get a fear trigger. So, one of the things that we understand is that Hippocampus, it's the area in the brain that is involved in memory storage, while the Amygdala is the fear center. So, if we perceive something that we understand as fear inducing, threatening, dangerous, then we may, go into an automatic response cycle, because the Amygdala may bypass our normal slower route to assessing threat and in the case of that image, I showed you preciously would be man at the party, umm… he was startled and yet there was no real threat and that's the amygdale firing quickly to send a message of danger that's incorrect. And sometimes, the hippocampus has stored memories along with the associated emotional content. This is important because what can happen is, the experience of the memory gets triggered and then all the emotions of fear, anxiety and the perception of danger get ignited. Here, so we have the Amygdala, the fear control center and if we go the flow route, we say umm… is this a correct response? The feeling of concern or worry, and we asses it and if it's not, we don't do anything, we just relax and umm… if we say, yes, there is something to be worried and concerned about, then the Amygdala will fire off very rapidly, a ignition to the whole body and the autonomic system will start to react. So, but, the big piece here is that sometimes the Amygdala gets it wrong and we need to slow down give our body a chance to assess content more accurately. And here, you'll see a simple list and it starts with trauma therapy-Psychotherapy-evidence based, TRI-PHASIC starting with stabilization and that's the important part, starting with stabilization, because now you really understand deeply that without the stabilization. The body can just continue responding as if the situation is dangerous when maybe it's not and have a chronic habit of ignition. So, when I do work with trauma survivors, I always start with stabilization, one being the stabilization video program, which is a thirty day video stabilization series. All the programs are under 10 minutes and they expose you to, some of the approaches that we have found very useful. And I use it as adjunctive therapy with my clients, right now. In that I'll see my clients and then I'll put them in the video stabilization program, so that they can actually, you know, every single day, get a corrected message to the body and the mind, to stabilize and in addition to that we work with umm… some breath trainer applications that we have been getting good results with, our clients with us well. Very simple, I'm gonna show you that shortly. Ah… Obviously, we want to encourage if needed, research based pharmacotherapy, physical therapies, psychosocial response, spiritual care and complementary and integrative approaches as needed. So, I just wanna make sure that you can see the breath trainer on your screen, can somebody can put their hand up to show me that you can… it's actually little blurry on your end, so what I'm gonna go is I'm gonna run this breath trainer and your only job is to watch the icon, get larger, and smaller. Follow the instructions and let the feeling of relaxation start to embed both in body and mind.

DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY I really always work within a CBT approach umm… use a lot, utilizing, stabilization, exposure and reconnection. But, umm… there are many other things for us to consider, as well, including uh… Psycho-Education, Telemedicine, Web based interventions and our newest program which is the trauma treatment online program as well, so that we're really umm… moving into different things that might be helpful for individuals. So consider this one, I really like this new application that PTSD coach, which is free for people to download and if you have smart phone the PTSD coach can be accessed and it's very useful tool that has a lot of different resources. And uh… just for your own um… tool kit, you might wanna have something like that available for yourself as well. We also have the Trauma treatment online coach, which is an online program that offers adjunctive therapy for clinicians and individuals struggling after Trauma. This is so in between therapy sessions. The people that you're working with can maintain their progress and keep on track, and they also get as part of the Trauma treatment online coach, the 30 days stabilization program and access to the breath trainer app, but many, many other exercises as well, just to keep them moving forward and on track with that stabilization. Psycho pharmacological approaches can be very important, umm… when prescribed through a qualified practitioner and some of the ones that we're recognizing as being uh… most strongly supported our fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline. And the SSNI- venlafaxine is strongly recommended. Now for people who are having sleep or nightmares, Prazosin has had some very good results as well. And so, you know, recognizing that these might be helpful and that your client may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist for a proper assessment and um… from a cope therapy. So, I also suggest, you know, that when people are able that they may want to use physical therapies as needed acupuncture, physiotherapy, Massage, Mindfulness… whatever is a good fit for the individual. But there is one thing that's I will encourage all of you to do, is make umm… get access to all of the resources that I'm gonna give you, today for free umm… and if you write down LEARN@PSYCHINK.COM and ask specifically for changes to PTSD 2013, which includes our brief Screener which is updated. Our thirty day challenge and the Breath Trainer link and all, make sure that my assistant gets all of those things to you. I do hope that this material has been meaningful to and provides you with a good foundation of understanding what happens to us after Trauma, from impact through to recovery. Remember all the resources that are available through the Traumatology Institute www.TicLearn.com and WhatisPTSD.com, wishing you a gentle day.
