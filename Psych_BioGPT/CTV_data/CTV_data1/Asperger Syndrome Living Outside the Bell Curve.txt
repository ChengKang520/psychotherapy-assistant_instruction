ANDREW Make to your leader, watch now my finger pitch, different. I'd like take out bark(ph)out of old dead trees. Cool, it’s a toad. 

00:00:50
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI Andrew Mozer has this wonderful innocence. 

00:00:55
ANDREW MOZER Yeah, I like being weird. 

00:01:00
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI That I don't see in a lot of other children. 

00:01:00
ANDREW MOZER Bananas. 

00:01:05
TOM MOZER He calls himself wired, people think that's bad but what he is trying to say is look at I'm different. 

00:01:10
Asperger Syndrome living outside the bell curve 

00:01:20
CYNTHIA Andrew's MOM He has a kind of autism, it's called the Asperger Syndrome. 

00:01:20
ANDREW MOZER He's having some mental problem. Hm... I have… Hm... 

00:01:25
TINA IYAMA , MD. ASSOC. PROF. OF PEDIATRICS UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON Somewhere between or may be one in 300, some people says many may be as one in 140 kids could be very frequent. 

00:01:35
ANDREW MOZER I’m pretty good at science, especially biology, becomes to the horrible facts. 

00:01:40
TINA IYAMA And children with the Asperger Syndrome tend to have higher IQs when they are tested. 

00:01:50
ANDREW MOZER Mongooses are kinda famous certainly(ph) for, for eating poisonous snakes like Cobras. 

00:02:00
TINA IYAMA They tend to be ah... brighter kids and some people feel that it really is only the IQ that's the variable that these are very bright children with autism. When other people feel that Asperger Syndrome has its own unique uhm... diagnostic entity. 

00:02:10
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI The Asperger kids are extremely verbal. But they have other autistic symptoms. 

00:02:20
Good what's another one? 

00:02:20
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI He doesn't... he doesn't have very good social skills, he doesn't make eye contact very well although that's something that we've worked on a lot. 

00:02:25
TINA IYAMA Children with Asperger Syndrome are socially delayed and socially a typical. They don't know what acting their age means; they don't look around them at the non-verbal cues other kids are giving them to model off of. Ah... they are their own person and they kinda see the world from their own point of view. Children with autisms and Asperger Syndrome tend to be black and white. You know the thing something either is or it isn't, there isn't any in between. So you are either sick or you are healthy, the world is ah… Um... a binary system if you will. Um... and one way to help kids with that is to develop um... a scale. Uhh… so that you have one to ten and um... you can either use a ruler or you can use a thermometer analogy or you can use whatever has as scale to what that they understand and say well, gee, maybe your health level is here when you are really healthy, how do you feel today? And are you... are you healthy down to your knees or you know you have that sick or you're kind of only this healthy. So to get them a sense that there are grace between the blacks and the whites and that's one way to build in um... analog thinking into a binary digital system. 

00:03:45
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI He has some very precise interests. 

00:03:45
TINA IYAMA Some children know everything there is to know about every dinosaur, ever... that ever lived on earth. 

00:03:50
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI If it's something he's not interested in, there is not much I can do or anyone can do to make him interested in it. 

00:04:00
TINA IYAMA Ah... There is a tremendous ability to you know some people would say obsess, other people would say focus. On a particular subject or, or a group of subjects. 

00:04:10
HOW IT STARTED 

00:04:15
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI Andrew was first diagnosed as autistic when he was in first grade. So he was about um... six or seven. 

00:04:25
TOM Andrew's DAD I mean we... we saw that Andrew was different but we didn't see them as having a big enough difference that was anything more than his personality. 

00:04:35
TINA IYAMA It's common for Asperger Syndrome children if you pick... picked up much later than children with autism. 

00:04:40
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI He um... had been diagnosed before that is being Attention Deficit Disorder. And be the sort of person I am, I jumped on that and started reading all of that material and I said wait a minute this doesn't make sense. 

00:04:55
TOM MOZER When we got down to the point that he has been diagnosed with that... with ADH and autism, we had to wrestle with whether this is intervention. Certainly he had to wrestle with Cynthia who felt ah... a lot of pressure from some people that she was doing things better or right, this wouldn’t be a problem. 

00:05:15
TINA IYAMA It's very common for young children with um... Autistic Spectrum Disorders to have Hyperactive Impulsive Inattentive Behaviors. And so it's not uncommon for them to first present as if they have ADHD. Um... I think the… the problem is the difference between children with ADHD and children with Aspergers is that their attentional problems come from a different source and children with ADHD, they often can't pay attention, I mean they are trouble focusing, they can't keep their minds on something and are distracted by um... the knocks on the wall or the noise birds outside or whatever is going on in their environment, whereas a child with Asperger syndrome and an Autistic Spectrum Disorder really is following their own internal agenda and is not distracted by the things other children would be distracted by. So they look like they're not paying attention to the environment, but it's for different reason. 

00:06:10
HOW DID IT HAPPEN 

00:06:15
TOM MOZER I don't think anybody knows for sure what causes autism. 

00:06:20
TINA IYAMA Ah… no, actually we don't know what causes it, we suspect that there are um... genetic factors involved. 

00:06:25
TOM MOZER My guess is you should born with it. 

00:06:25
TINA IYAMA And there… there are some family patterns. 

00:06:30
TOM MOZER I see it just simply because I see cases of autism when I look back through my family, running in the family. 

00:06:35
TINA IYAMA And we don't have any way to make a diagnosis except for clinically. We can't send kids off to the lab and get a test or a scan or anything to find out. It's a... it's a clinical diagnosis. There is no medication for Asperger Syndrome or for autism, but there are medications that may help a child who is having trouble with functioning in a particular area. 

00:07:00
ANDREW MOZER And it's how we… help me go to sleep. Um... Sometimes I had, just doesn’t work, it seems I just... my body just as a (inaudible ) to go to sea. That's why I sometimes read books more. 

00:07:15
TINA IYAMA And I would always try behavioral interventions first medications are always my last resort. 

00:07:20
IT'S A SOCIAL THING 

00:07:20
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI Andrew's disability is really very hidden. It's, even he is waking down the hall, he looks like he is a geeky kid walking down the hall but he doesn’t, it does… does not obvious if there is anything wrong with him. 

00:07:35
ANDREW MOZER I've been pretty much alone except from my family. 

00:07:40
TINA IYAMA Being a loner is part of the social difficulties that children have. They um... don't have, may not have much of a social drive that is they may not feel the need to purse ah... friendships as strongly as most children do. Ah… so they seem to be more, they seem to be more content alone. 

00:08:00
ANDREW MOZER I don't really know what a friend is, not exactly. 

00:08:05
TINA IYAMA Um... I think the problem develops when children, um... especially the brighter kids and the kids with Asperger Syndrome ah... realize that they are somehow different than the other kids they see. And that starts to you, trouble them, why does everyone else have a friend and why don't I um... can, is part of a… a growing self awareness that um... children have typically sort even the really teenaged, mid till the teenage years. Um... they started to recognize their um... differences and wonder what it is about them that makes them different. Ah... That can often lead to a depression in those years so I think something that parents have to be aware of ah... that children with Aspergers Syndrome have more risk for depression and be just because of that ah... they may isolation, they may seem like they're okay right now but may be they are starting to wonder whether they really or not. There are probably lifelong impacts on how a person relates socially to other people. Now maybe that's okay, may be they find um... a partner in life who is comfortable, more comfortable not going out to parties and happy and content like reading books at home or watching movies or whatever and... and more isolated activities and they may find a very um… you know comfortable and happy life that way. Um... on the other hand, um... you... you may be a set up for relationship problems because a person with Asperger Syndrome isn't always has tuned into the other persons needs. 

00:09:45
IT'S A "SENSITIVE" TOPIC 

00:09:45
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI One of the things that happens with Andrew is that he is extremely sensitive to texture and sent in all of those things that he have to do with food. So there are, not a lot of foods that he'll eat. 

00:10:00
TINA IYAMA Sensory issues are common in children with Asperger Syndrome. Um... So ah... the... the way something looks, or the way something smells or the way ah… food feels in our mouth can... can completely determined whether it actually goes in and get swallowed. So um... yes, that's a sensory issue that some children with Aspergers have problems with their clothing and they can't sense it in kinds of cloths closure. The tags in their... and their shirts have to come out and um... some children are very noise sensitive, it's the little baby who... who is freaked up by the vacuum cleaner or who um... ah... can't take the hand dryer in public bathrooms or and they just get… they just are... they have sort of panic attack over some of these sounds sometimes. So, it's a sensory um... perception that's different than ah… more typically developing children. 

00:10:55
ANDREW MOZER It's S-P-I-D-E-R word don’t say it. 

00:11:00
Oh, okay. 

00:11:00
ANDREW MOZER I don't like hearing the word and I don't see like seeing them close up. 

00:11:05
TINA IYAMA Children often have fears of different things and it's not always predictable but parents always know what they are once they've... once they have been with their child awhile and figured it out. 

00:11:15
ANDREW MOZER There is also I don't to fear of stickers, I know it's common for xenophobia(ph), but I just don't see it like stickers that decorative, when as the kids will put on the lunch boxes and stuff. 

00:11:30
TINA IYAMA And the best thing to do really is as much as possible kind of avoid those circumstances until the child is old enough to be able to talk the way through it and realize you know this is just a barking dog behind the fence. This isn't going to hurt me or this spiders really a lot littler than me and it won't hurt me. Ah… so until they can rationalize and understand the way around it, it's really sometimes very hard and sometimes better to avoid situations that expose them. 

00:12:00
BELL CURVE CHALLENGES 

00:12:00
TINA IYAMA Children on the autism spectrum tend to be less tuned into other people's words. 

00:12:10
TOM MOZER Given a set of instruction verbally um... as suppose to in writing or a post(ph) in a picture format, Andrew is... is almost deaf. 

00:12:20
TINA IYAMA Communication involves both talking and listening and so listening is often a harder thing. 

00:12:25
TOM MOZER If you talk to Andrew, certainly you can hear and if you test Andrew for hearing, he hears everything. He has better hearing than his dad does by the way. 

00:12:35
TINA IYAMA And the kids were very good readers are much more tuned into say written directions than verbal directions. 

00:12:40
TOM MOZER But in... in you know in assimilating instructions verbally he can't do that. 

00:12:45
TINA IYAMA The ability do not just to initiating interaction with someone but to respond to that interaction, that's the reciprocity that's so hard for children with on the spectrum to achieve. 

00:13:00
ANDREW Hey, baby boomers are retiring. 

00:13:00
I agree. 

00:13:05
TINA IYAMA Um... they just, they don't know when somebody is kidding, they may not know um... they don't may not understand idioms, they're often very literal about how they interpret things like, oh, he's just pulling your leg or that person is a tuff cookie, they look at you like you have simply lost your mind. 

00:13:20
Because I know we don't have more memories, Andrew? 

00:13:25
TINA IYAMA When you get into a school setting, you need to just reflexible who are willing to say not everybody has to follow exactly the same path, we can let this guy do this thing that they are good at for part of the day and then we'll bring them into the circle time when they're ready. 

00:13:40
Obed(ph), lets write them all down, 17, 92… 

00:13:45
TINA IYAMA Some children with Aspergers would need ah... teacher's aide some children don't ah... sometimes it helps a kid who is very distractible um... stay on the agenda of the teacher as suppose that to their own agenda. Children um... all across the autism spectrum are... are typically very routine bound and upset with changes in their schedule especially unpredictable changes um… keep parents often do better if they can foreshadow a change, like tomorrow we're going to do something a little different ah... that helps kids prepare. Um... ah... you never... the parents never know which particular thing it is that the change is going to be upsetting to a child and so that's, ah... that's kind of hard um... that for a parent to know, well it was okay that I substituted the 7 Up for the Sprite, but it wasn't okay that I went from straight macaroni, noodles to curvy macaroni noodles. I think the routines and the rituals kind to help, um… make a very unpredictable social world more predictable for them. You know you… you just have to be to, in order to work with children who have developmental differences, you have to be flexible and you have to tune in to the child's needs. 

00:15:05
DOWN THE ROAD 

00:15:05
TINA IYAMA I think the future for children with Asperger Syndrome depends a lot on um... their own inner resources. So their... their capacity to transcend this difficulty ah... it depends on the family support. They've been given on the educational programs they have had and the therapists they worked with. 

00:15:25
TOM MOZER There are times you would, you look at your kids and you like them to be something that... that you like them to be. 

00:15:30
ANDREW Also the… (inaudible )baby. 

00:15:36
TOM MOZER You can also see the differences they are and particularly as they get older you see them growing to their own person. And they have their own new answers which are uniquely theirs and those are the things that as time goes on, you begin to enjoy the most because then they become different people. 

00:15:50
TINA IYAMA I think children with Asperger Syndrome do come with special gifts and abilities as well as these incredible challenges. 

00:16:00
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI They were the kids who were the odd kids. They were the kids who went to college and were the nerds and we probably in society just let them grow up and they became the Bill Gates and the Bobby Fischers of the world. 

00:16:15
TINA IYAMA I think children with Asperger Syndrome in general are, are very interesting people. You know it's too bad that I think we can no longer just be eccentric or corky or hard, we have to have a diagnosis. 

00:16:25
TOM MOZER You look at people who are autistic and you look at Andrew, you can almost bet there would be some world of scientist. 

00:16:35
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI He wants to do something to work with animals. 

00:16:40
ANDREW MOZER May be a zookeeper. 

00:16:40
TINA IYAMA I think the future can be very bright for children with Asperger Syndrome. 

00:16:45
ANDREW MOZER As long as I don't like to work in the insect house. 

00:16:50
CYNTHIA DICAMELLI These kids bring such joy to you that if you let them, if you don’t, we don’t try to make them something that they are not and just enjoy with them for what they are, you're going to find a lot more joy and a lot more acceptance.
