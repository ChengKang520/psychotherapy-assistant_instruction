00:00:00
Nashville, TN 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Here we are at the happy hour Mental Health Center, in Nashville, Tennessee and said, we’ve come here talking about ten sessions and I don’t know if you remember that but we did discuss that. And I’m just kinda wondering what thoughts went through your mind when you walked in the door. So I usually start on my right side but let’s start on my right side again. So and you. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN I want to go home. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN You want to go home? You want to go home. By the way, I’ll talk loud so you can see in here. Normally you don’t shout at somebody, you know, that far away from you but… but I’ll talk loud so you can see and hear and that might sound a little impersonal because that is because I want to be heard. Uh… Okay, so anyway, Sonya(ph), what you said? 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN I wanna go home. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN You wanna go home? Is that what went through your mind when you came in the door? 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. I don’t know why I’m here. 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN Okay, okay. All right! Tom, how about you? 

00:01:05
TOM You said 10 sessions. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:01:10
TOM I was gonna point out this is a recession. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Well, it’s kind, we’re making it a procession. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN That was a good line. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then… then we’ll cease after that but not until now. All right. So what thoughts went through your mind? 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN A lot. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN A lot like could you give an example? 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN Well, usually I hear voices. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN You hear voices. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN That’s right. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN Good, good. Okay, you came to the right place. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Do you hear it too? 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Well, I hear yours but I don’t hear, I, all the voices I hear outside of me but… 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN My voices are outside of me too. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN All right. Thank god. But we’ll come back to that. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Otherwise we’d crowded in there. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. We’ll come back to that. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Bill, how about you? What thoughts went through your mind? 

00:01:55
BILL Well, what happened is my father spent a lot of money to put me through college and now I don’t feel like going to work. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Oh, did you graduate? 

00:02:05
BILL Yes. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Okay. So what… what did, what thoughts went through your mind? Is that what these… 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Well, I just, I just don’t know. Like, I just don’t like working. That’s all. I never did work very much and my father always supported me and he went through college and I had a good life but now the idea of going to work, I don’t know. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. Sarah, what thoughts went through your mind? 

00:02:35
SARAH You know, I don’t really feel well. Could I, can I leave early? 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Well, we kind of got about an hour and a half. So uh… we could maybe cut it short two, three minutes. What thoughts went through your mind? 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN That’s… that’s pretty much it… 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN So you’d like to, you’d like to end? 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Okay, Roberta? 

00:03:00
ROBERTA Well, first of all I don’t remember talking about… 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:05
ROBERTA But you thought, you know, you’re in charge so that’s what you, you and my probation officer were… 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, we were at that… 

00:03:15
ROBERTA You know, I’m thinking that… 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN So is that what your mind, you want to have some naps? 

00:03:20
ROBERTA Yeah. I’ll take a nap. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Greg, how about you? What thoughts went through your mind? 

00:03:25
GREG I think I’m in the wrong group here. Guy over here hears voices. I mean, I got a couple of… 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:30
GREG I think I’m in a wrong group. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Okay, so is that what went through your mind? 

00:03:35
GREG Yeah, I don’t think I belong here. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay, well, how many people think now this is the place where I really belong in this mental-health clinic? How many people think that? Tom? How about you Roberta? 

00:03:50
ROBERTA (inaudible). 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Do you think you belong here? 

00:03:55
ROBERTA No. I… 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Sarah? 

00:03:55
SARAH No. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Okay, Bill? 

00:04:00
BILL Well, I hope I belong here. I hope somebody in this group has gotten a job and tells me something about working. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN That’s good. 

00:04:10
BILL I just don’t think working is really good. But that is what my father told me and supported me. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Okay, are you excited and enthusiastic about being here? 

00:04:20
BILL Well, again when this group so, I could get some information that will persuade me to go to work and maybe someone in here there’s group is going to work and would impress me. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. That’s possible. Greg, how about you? 

00:04:35
GREG I… I don’t want to be here. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN You don’t want to be here. 

00:04:40
GREG Like I said, I think I’m in the wrong room. 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Soniya, how about you? 

00:04:45
SONIYA I don’t see why I am here. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. So you all have some uh… reason for being here in the sense that you either want to be here or somebody sent you. Would that be true? No, so somebody sent you. 

00:05:00
ROBERTA My probation officer, Brantley. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. That’s what I mean. That’s what I mean. 

00:05:05
ROBERTA He’s waiting outside the door for me. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, okay. Sarah, how about you? 

00:05:10
SARAH My mom sent me. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN And your dad sent you Bill? 

00:05:10
BILL Yes, absolutely. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Okay, Greg? 

00:05:15
GREG Rode my bike. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, but I mean somebody kind of pushed you to come here. 

00:05:20
GREG I have a judge. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN My mom. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Okay. So that’s interesting that you have that in common. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN What? 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN That somebody sent you here. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Well, I didn’t want to come here. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN No. I understand that, sure. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN I want to know if anybody here has got to work and likes his job, that’s what my father… 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Well, we’re gonna get to that. we’ll see they have legal jobs. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, well. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, we just haven’t gotten there yet. We, that usually takes about three sessions to get to that and but this seems to be a pretty fast moving group. So we might get there quiet, quiet early. 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN You got a license bill? 

00:06:05
BILL No. I don’t have a license. I’m looking for work. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) You know, this is… 

00:06:10
BILL My father bought me a nice car and I drive all around but I just don’t want to go to work. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. Well, we’ll… we’ll see if you want to work on that. 

00:06:25
BILL Well, I find like some find someone who… who has a job and the job and likes the job. That’s what I’m looking for. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, there maybe somebody in here who does, who has that. Uh… But there’s one thing you’ve seen they have in common and that is like somebody pushed you in the door. Right? Now I have another question. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN I drove here. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, but I mean… 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN In a good car, yeah. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Yeah… yeah… yeah. Okay, so umm… now I want to ask you another question. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN These people seem kind of lazy. I don’t know if I find the kind of person… 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN I’m optimistic. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. I’ve got a job. I’ve got a job. I’m not lazy. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Well, what do you do for the job? You get paid? 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I get paid. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Tell me about that. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN I work in a bar. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN You work in a bar? 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Okay, well, I’m not a drunk. I would like to drink… 

00:07:35
(crosstalk) 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Okay, now I want to ask something else. Uh… Would it be true that somebody out there wants something from you that they’re not getting? I Mean, I’m not saying that’s good, bad, reasonable but… 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN My father sent me here. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN He bought me a good car and I like driving the car but my father said me… 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN You don’t want to work? 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN I want to work but I guess… 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Oh, oh, you do? 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN I… I… I want to work but I have to find the right kind of a job. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. All right. So he sent you here. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN And… 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN My father owns a big company and I don’t want to work for his company. The people there, I visit the company, nobody is happy there. I’m looking for a happy place. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, you want a happy job but he wants something from you that you don’t want to give him which is the work, the kind of work that he wants you to do. Is that accurate? I mean, I’m just listening. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Well, he says, you have to go to a group and maybe something’s wrong with me that he’s giving me all this stuff and then I don’t, I don’t get the job but actually I want a good job. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN You want a job but he wants, I’m not sure about this now. Does he want something from you that he’s not getting? I thought that’s what you said originally. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Well, that’s what I said. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Greg, what about you? 

00:09:05
(crosstalk) 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Now what does somebody want from you that they’re not getting? 

00:09:10
GREG what they want from me? I guess they want me to quit drinking. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay, they want that for you. 

00:09:20
GREG But you know, I didn’t, I mean, I had few beers and I don’t think it’s going wrong with that. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Okay, Soniya, there’s somebody, what do they want from you? 

00:09:25
SONIYA My mom want me staying without drugs and to be at home. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:09:30
SONIYA Every night. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Tom? 

00:09:35
TOM My girlfriend sent me. I’ve got to stop listening to these voices or she’s gonna throw me out of the house. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN So she wants you to not hear the voices or whatever. 

00:09:45
TOM That’s right. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Something, okay. Roberta? 

00:09:50
ROBERTA the big R word. My mother (inaudible). 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN What’s the R word? 

00:09:50
ROBERTA Respect. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN Respect. 

00:09:55
ROBERTA Yeah. To respect people. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN She thinks she’s not getting. 

00:10:00
ROBERTA She thinks… 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Okay, Sarah? 

00:10:00
SARAH I don’t really know what my mom wants from me. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Well, could you just take a guess? 

00:10:10
SARAH I guess, to probably to feel better but I think I should probably see a doctor. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Um-hmm. So she wants you to feel better. Okay, and she’s not getting that. Okay, okay. Now so I get the idea, I think you can tell me if this is true or not. You’d like these people to leave you alone. Would that be accurate? You want your people off your back Roberta? 

00:10:35
ROBERTA She can stop playing that record for me… 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Okay. You want her to leave you alone. Soniya? 

00:10:40
SONIYA Yeah, I would love my mom to go away and leave me alone. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, all right. Greg? 

00:10:50
GREG I don’t think I did anything wrong. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN No, I understand that. So you want them to get off your back and quit telling you that you’re doing something wrong. 

00:10:55
GREG I guess. Yeah. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN I’m just saying, I’m just trying to understand. 

00:11:00
(crosstalk) 

00:11:05
GREG All right. Yeah, I guess someone to pour it off my back. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, because you only had a few beers. 

00:11:10
GREG I only had a few. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Bill, you want your dad off your back? 

00:11:15
BILL My dad’s not exactly on my back but he kind of bought me the nice car and everything else and he thinks I ought to go to work and I… I… I think maybe he’s right. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay, okay, but does he tell you tell you that pretty often? 

00:11:30
BILL No, not too often but I know it’s on his mind. 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN It’s on his mind. 

00:11:35
BILL (inaudible) He employees 2,000 people. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:35
BILL He knows, he knows what work is. I know what work is too. I visited the factory. But I don’t think anybody there’s happy. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, okay. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN My girlfriend, I like. She just doesn’t like my voices. 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN But you would like her to quit talking about it. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN Oh, sure. I’d like her to just love me for me and my voices. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN So I get the idea. I get the idea that that’s something you have in common that something is not going as well as you’d like it to go in your life and that’s oftentimes not always but oftentimes due to what people are saying to you or what they think about you or what their urging you to do. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Absolutely! 

00:12:20
BILL I want a happy life and I want a job that makes me money and… 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN So you can drive your car there. 

00:12:30
BILL Well, I have a car with my father strictly cut me off for money or anything but he… he, the guys in his factory, they make, they make pretty good money but I want to do a more exciting job. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN You don’t want to do what they do. 

00:12:45
BILL I’d like to work on a newspaper or something like that. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Yeah! All right. Okay. 

00:12:55
SONIYA I would love to uh (inaudible). 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN You like them to leave you alone. 

00:13:00
SONIYA Yeah. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Well, that seems to be something else you have in common that to some degree or greater or lesser degree, somebody’s telling you about something. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, absolutely. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:13:20
(crosstalk) 

00:13:25
BILL He wants me to work in his factory and they pay good money but that’s a lousy factory. It’s a dirty lousy place. I’d like to work out a newspaper or something like that. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN I bet he argues a lot. 

00:13:40
BILL You know, you argue with my father, he tells me what he wants I’m waiting for it and I drive his nice car around and I agree with my father but I don’t want to work at his factory. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Well, I think you’ve made that clear. 

00:13:55
ROBERTA Why don’t you even want to work if he’s willing to just support you? Just lay back and enjoy it. You’re lucky. 

00:14:05
BILL I don’t feel lucky. 

00:14:05
ROBERTA Your dad thinks you’re a loser? My mom thinks I have attitude. 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN Okay. I want to, I want to ask you another question. Umm… Would you like to make things a little different for yourselves? That’s sounds like a similar question but that’s a little bit different. Sarah, would you like to make things a little different for yourself? 

00:14:35
SARAH Yeah. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Roberta? That’s a yes or no? 

00:14:45
ROBERTA I don’t know. I need to develop an attitude that people like more. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Well, you like our life to be a little different. Is that, is that what you’re saying? Close to close, would you like your life to be a little bit different? 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Soniya? 

00:15:05
SONIYA Yes. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN All right. So I got, I’m sure you would like your life to be a little bit… 

00:15:10
BILL Yes, I’ve been to college and everything and… 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, we got it, okay. Greg, how about you? 

00:15:15
GREG I think you can just sign the paper and I can get out of this, you know, revisited (inaudible). 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN You would like your life to be a little different. These people are kinda urging you to do things. 

00:15:25
GREG Yeah. 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN And they’re not getting the message. I’m just trying to summarize what it’s like. They’re not getting the message that you want them to have. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN No complaints. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN What’s that? 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN No complaints. I don’t want any complaints. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Oh, I see what you mean. You don’t want any complaints from somebody else. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN So you would, you would like your life to be different. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN I would her to straighten up her act. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s interesting that you want her to straighten up her act but she sent you here. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN I’m accusing her. I don’t think I have a problem. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN No, no. I understand that but umm… does anybody have any comment for Tom? What do you think? Anybody want to say anything to him about what he just said? I mean, something that would be helpful? 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Maybe she only wants to deal with one of you. 

00:16:25
(crosstalk) 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Could you hold off on that? Sarah did you hear what Roberta just said? 

00:16:30
SARAH No. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Okay, could Say that again? Roberta, say it again. Could you say that again? 

00:16:40
ROBERTA Maybe… maybe she only wants to deal with one of them. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Now Sarah, I want to ask you a question. Tell me whether you think that was helpful to Tom? Just guess it. 

00:16:45
SARAH No. 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Just… just wondering. 

00:16:55
SONIYA Are you doing drugs? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:17:00
SONIYA Because sometimes I hear some voices. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN You do too? 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN Who do you hear from? 

00:17:05
SONIYA Well, when I have umm… drugs sometimes, I hear good voices. Not people criticizing me, people saying good things… 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN My voices never criticize me. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN So you hear voices? 

00:17:20
SONIYA Sometimes… 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN No. He doesn’t hear voices. 

00:17:25
(crosstalk) 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN So you have these kind of voices, they’re like advisers uh? 

00:17:35
SONIYA Well… 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN You have a board of trustees that give you advice? 

00:17:40
SONIYA Sometimes. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Now let me ask you this, Greg, when people hear these voices, do you think that they have to follow the advice they get? 

00:17:50
GREG (inaudible) 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN No, the people, the people. Soniya and Tom? 

00:17:55
TOM They don’t have to. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN They don’t have to. What they, are you, are you saying, I don’t want to put words in your mouth but are you saying they have a choice? 

00:18:05
TOM Yeah. You always, you got a choice. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN They have a choice to… 

00:18:10
TOM Yeah. Just don’t, just stop it. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Okay, okay, okay. All right so… 

00:18:15
BILL I think, I think that group would get more involved with each other we can all help each other little more. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:18:20
BILL Takes us time to do that. You can’t do it the first night. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN No. It takes, it’s going to take time but that’s what we’re trying to do now. Let me ask you Bill, is there, look around the room and is there anybody here in this group that you think you could help? 

00:18:40
BILL Well, I have a lot of advantages that I don’t have any money problems and I’ve got a car and everything. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, but I mean, by saying something to them. I don’t mean driving them or giving them money but just saying something, any kind of comment that would be helpful to anybody. 

00:19:00
BILL Well, I could say to them, this man Greg especially that even though he drinks, he seemed like a really nice guy and probably has friends and I don’t have many friends because we were brought up by, I don’t have many friends but I could use a good friend. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Well, that’s a very interesting comment. Would you, so you would like to have friends? 

00:19:25
BILL Absolutely! 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN It’s kind of like in your mind is a scale that’s out of balance. You want a friend but you don’t have a friend. 

00:19:30
BILL Right. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN Would that be true? 

00:19:30
BILL Well, people who are very wealthy like, like I am, they don’t have many friends. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, that’s true. So you would like one now. Can we put that on, no let’s not put that on hold. Is there anybody who could say something to Bill that might be helpful as far as developing a friend? 

00:19:50
ROBERTA Well, I’ll be his friend if he loans me his car…. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, other than cars and money and jobs, just… 

00:20:00
BILL No, I know, I know I can have friends if I give the money, that’s not what I’m looking for. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:20:00
BILL I’m looking for a friend that wants to be with me and… and kind of whether they drive my car whose car or his car, it doesn’t make any difference but we… we do something interesting and maybe a friend working, that would be a very good friend to have. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. Now my question is, is can anyone say anything to Bill who would or that would be helpful for finding a friend outside of this group which will not involve money, driving and so on. Can you think of anything Soniya? 

00:20:40
SONIYA Well, maybe umm… if he goes out and see someone in street and he says, “Hi” with a smiling face and maybe someone could, it be woken him and say hello at least. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Okay. So you’re saying smiling helps. 

00:21:00
SONIYA Maybe… 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Okay. It’s very interesting observation. Isn’t it? Because friends do smile and laugh together, don’t they? 

00:21:10
SONIYA He’s very serious all the time. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, up till now but that’s what we’re here for to help make some changes. Now let me ask you this, do you have any friends Soniya who… who uh… you know, would not get you in trouble? 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
SONIYA Well, they, getting, no, not really. I have friends… 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN You never ever had friends who did not get you in trouble? 

00:21:40
SONIYA I think long time ago. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Long time ago. Okay. Does anyone wanna know about her friends that maybe she had years ago that did not get her in shovel? Would you like to hear that, Tom? 

00:21:50
TOM No. Bill, I can help you. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Let’s come back to that. Roberta, would you, would you like to hear about her friends? 

00:21:55
ROBERTA Well, when did you start taking drugs? Is that when you lost all your friends? 

00:22:05
SONIYA I haven’t think about it but it was long time ago. Since I was eight or ten years… 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN You were eight or ten years old. 

00:22:10
SONIYA Yeah. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Um-hmm! 

00:22:15
SONIYA I started taking… 

00:22:15
BILL I’m interested in what Tom has to say. He said, he can help me. 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, we’ll come back to that. Yeah, that was Tom. Okay. So you had some friends when you were… 

00:22:30
SONIYA Yeah, when I was a little girl. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:30
SONIYA When I was eight, more or less. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, and you played with them probably and… 

00:22:40
SONIYA Yeah, at school. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN What else did you do with them? 

00:22:40
SONIYA At school but later I went out of school when I… I decided not to go back. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Uh… Can I ask you this, uh… well, that’s not a question. Tell us about whether you would like to have a friend now who would not get you in trouble? 

00:23:00
SONIYA Yes, I would like. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN You would like to. You want to work on that in this group? 

00:23:05
SONIYA Well, maybe. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN By having a friend not in this group, I mean? 

00:23:10
SONIYA By in this group? 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN No. A friend outside of the group. 

00:23:15
SONIYA Uh… Okay. Outside that group, yes. 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Okay, we’ll… we’ll… we’ll be coming back to that. Sarah, how about you? You’ve been kind of quiet here now and that’s okay but umm… 

00:23:25
SARAH I don’t really feel well. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Don’t you? Okay. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN What do you want, Sarah? 

00:23:30
SARAH What do you mean, what I… 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN What do you think? 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN Okay, Roberta could you, could you say something to Sarah relative to having a friend outside of this group, how to go about that? A friend that would not let her in trouble. 

00:23:50
SARAH I would like to say to Bill, Bill, don’t tell people you have money, they’re going to take advantage of you. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Okay, did you, did you hear that? Say that again. 

00:24:00
SARAH Don’t tell people you have money. They’re going to take advantage of you. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Okay, now don’t say anything, don’t say anything. Greg, did you hear that comment? 

00:24:10
GREG Yeah, I did. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN If… if… if you were in Bill’s position, would you see that as helpful or hurtful? 

00:24:15
GREG About having the money? 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN No. What she said. She said very kindly. Don’t tell people you got a lot of money, they’ll take advantage. 

00:24:30
GREG Yeah, I don’t know all that well but it seems like a nice… 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN But if someone said that to you, would you see that as helpful? 

00:24:35
GREG Yeah. 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Because I would. I would see that as very helpful. All right. Now let me ask you this. Did you hear what she said about don’t tell people that you have a lot of money because they’ll take advantage? 

00:24:45
BILL Yes, I did hear that. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Okay, what are your thoughts about that comment? 

00:24:50
BILL Well, it’s a good comment. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:24:55
BILL And probably, in my life, I have taken advantage of but not that much. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Okay, but… but her advice… 

00:25:00
BILL It’s good advice, yeah and… 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Were you happy when she said that? I mean, did you feel… 

00:25:10
BILL I’m… I’m… I’m more concerned about what Tom had to say. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN I know, I know but I just want to ask you and we hear about Roberta, what she said. 

00:25:15
BILL It was good. She said a good thing. 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, now why don’t, it’s okay, why don’t you talk to Tom? 

00:25:25
TOM Bill, I think you know, given that you want a friend, you can join the YMCA again with some activities and have probably quite a few friends. 

00:25:35
BILL That’s… that’s a very good advice. I’ve never gotten to something like that and… and the way, the way has a pool and some other stuff and that’s… that’s a good advice. So don’t remember what Tom’s here for but he’s given me some good advice. 

00:25:55
TOM Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN We say that when somebody says that you’ve got, that you’ve helped them. 

00:26:00
TOM Thank you. 

00:26:05
BILL You’re welcome. Why don’t you tell me, I forgot, in the group. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Well, his girlfriend sent him because she says he hears these voices. 

00:26:15
BILL That wouldn’t bother me. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN No. No, it bothers her. 

00:26:20
TOM Yeah. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:20
BILL That’s everything but what I mean, if he hears voices, well, (inaudible) things like that. He gave me some good advice and I think I’ll go to the YMCA. 

00:26:35
TOM Well, I’ll go with you. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Okay, when… when would you do that? 

00:26:40
BILL Well, we can talk about right… right… right… 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN How about right now? You wanna talk about it? 

00:26:45
BILL Yeah. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Okay. You want to go to the lunch? 

00:26:45
TOM Sure. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN How about you, Greg? 

00:26:55
GREG I think Tom’s up with something. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Well, we don’t know. He seems, I mean, we don’t know. We don’t know. Uh… but anyway what do you think about them, you know, going to the Y? 

00:27:05
GREG I guess it would be all right. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Okay, can I make a suggestion, Tom? 

00:27:10
TOM Sure. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN No exchange of money takes place between you two. 

00:27:15
TOM Not a problem. 

00:27:15
BILL Tom hasn’t said he’s broker or anything? 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN No. I know. I’m just trying to look down he world a little bit. 

00:27:20
BILL Okay. Okay. 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:25
BILL Because I don’t, I don’t, I don’t take my wallet everyday and give out $20. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN That’s right, that’s right. So it should easy… it should be easy to resist in the event that he asked you. 

00:27:35
BILL Certainly. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:35
TOM Wait a minute. I talk to God and he would criticize me harshly if I did that. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Good, good, that’s good. Now when you go to the Y, can I make another suggestion? 

00:27:45
TOM Sure. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Can you ask God to kinda put it on hold for a while? 

00:27:50
TOM What? 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN The conversation. 

00:27:55
TOM I’ll be busy talking to Bill. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN You’ll be busy talking to Bill and if god says and you just say, “Hold off, God. Wait for your turn.” 

00:28:05
(crosstalk) 

00:28:10
TOM …that was fine. 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:28:15
BILL We’re hoping to build our life together. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Good, good. Umm… Okay, any closer to a job or anything? 

00:28:25
BILL No. I’m not any closer to a job and I’m not any further away from a job. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Did you see anybody there that worked at the Y that you might you know, that… that… that enjoy their jobs, seem happy? 

00:28:40
BILL I… I see, I see more people at the Y that are happy than I see in my father’s factory. 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, the employees? They seem happy? That’s what I’m asking. Okay, all right. 

00:29:00
BILL …happy and unhappy. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Uh… Sarah, how about you? Did you have any pleasant conversations with anybody? 

00:29:05
SARAH My mom bought me a camera because I came here last week. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. Bought her a camera because she came here. Okay and what… what did you, were you with her when she bought it? 

00:29:20
SARAH No. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Okay. And what happened when she brought it home and showed it to you? 

00:29:25
SARAH I came out of my room and I umm… said thank you and then I take it back to my room and earned how to use it. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN Oh, you read, you studied the directions? 

00:29:35
SARAH Um-hmm! 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Really? How long did that take you? 

00:29:40
SARAH Umm… not that long because I studied, I studied cameras a little bit in college. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:45
SARAH So… 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN How long did it take? 

00:29:50
SARAH Umm… Maybe like 20 minutes and then I just started playing with it. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Could you tell us, tell me how you felt when you read that, do you remember? 

00:30:00
SARAH How I felt when I read… read the owner’s manual? 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:05
SARAH Umm… I guess, I felt, I felt glad. My mom knew that I wanted a camera. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN So you felt a little less depressed, glad? Is that what you’re saying? 

00:30:15
SARAH Yeah. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Wow! So when you do something, you feel better for 20 minutes. 

00:30:25
SARAH Yeah. 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Huh? Wow! Umm… Yeah… I think we’re onto something here. Hmm… What do you think? 

00:30:45
SARAH Well, my back still hurts. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah but you said you didn’t feel quite so depressed, you felt a little more joyful when you did that. 

00:30:50
SARAH Yeah. 

00:30:55
