DR. TINA PAYNE BRYSON Hi, I'm Dr. Tina Payne Bryson. And some of you may be familiar with my work, but just I'll take a second here to tell you in my clinical world, I do Psychotherapy with kids and adolescents and I do a lot of parenting consultations. In the academic world, I get to function as a child development specialist or school counselor at uh… St. Mark's school in southern California here and umm… I get to write, I'm the co-author of the books, "The Whole-Brain Child" and "No-Drama Discipline" with Dr Dan Siegel, who many of you know. Umm… And I also get to be a mom of three boys who are umm… in high school, middle school and elementary school. So, those are sort of some different lenses I bring to what I get to talk with you about today. Umm… I'm gonna to share some stories about my work with different families, umm… even some of my own parenting stuff and what we're gonna be doing today is, focusing on understanding how the brain and the nervous system and all of these different things play into helping kids really be resilient when it comes to anxiety. And even though that's the focus of this webinar, we will be talking about some other issues umm… like depression and some other kinds of things that are similar in terms of mood or in terms of impairment when it comes to kids freedom to go out and kind of be in the world. So, let's start with this first slide of where do we begin and I don't know about you, but in my own training, I was really taught kind of what we can think about as downriver. Umm… And it, what I mean by that is uh… well, let, let me tell, let me tell a quick story first and then the analogy will work a little bit better. I remember hearing a story. I umm… my undergraduate degree is actually in education. My plan was to become a high school English teacher. And I think I might have heard this in one of my education classes or it could have possibly been umm… in either my master's or PhD in social work umm… somewhere along the way. But, here's the story, there are all these children who keep falling into the river and so all of the workers and the helpers run to the bottom of the river, down river, where the children are… are falling in, or, the door the children have fallen in and they start grabbing them and pulling them out and… and they can't get to all of them and at some point, one of the workers stops and starts to run away from this place down river where they're pulling all of the kids out and someone stops and yells, "Where are you going? We need you here. There are all these kids in the river. They're drowning, you have to help pull them out." And the person says, "I'm going up river to find out, why they keep falling in?" And I love that story because so much of the lens that parents and teachers and even clinicians have is a down river view. And what I mean by that based on this analogy is that we are kind of helping intervene with kids once they're already drowning. And the problem with that is, then we only look at behavior, or we only look at symptom alleviation, or we only look at trying to build skills for them to do better and all of those things are super important and I'm a huge fan of all of those things. But, it's a narrow view and so, if we can look at the whole river and we stop to also go up river to find out why the kid has fallen in, in the first place, it can be extremely helpful. To break it down more in terms of this anxiety piece, you know, my training was such that the understanding I had of anxiety was that, if a person, let's say a child has anxiety, it's probably because if… if the anxiety meets all the criteria in the DSM whichever version ran at the time, umm… then the reason that they have anxiety is because they have an anxiety disorder, but to me that's crazy thinking that circular reasoning, that doesn't give me any information about what caused it really or where do I go from there umm… because if we find out more what has led to the anxiety or what is underneath it or what is up river, what caused, what are the factors that play into what kind of anxiety, how it manifests, how we can go about changing it, we can be so much more effective. So, what I wanna do is kind of shift the lens not only for ourselves, but also in the other people in a child's life is to go, we'll go to the first slide here. Our lens is number one slide, 'The Whole River.' So, of course, we wanna look at alleviating symptoms, building skills, helping them get out of the river, so that they can function well. But, we also need to look at the upriver stuff and the swim through kind of just the diagnosis, or just the behaviors to understand more. So, you see here on the slide, what I have one here is that we want to curiously look behind, beyond what we've been taught. So, a lot of the assumptions that we based our interventions on, a lot of the assumptions about the meaning of the behavior can actually really shift if we bring curiosity to the picture. Umm… one example of that is, umm… I hear one of the symptoms or one of the issues that gets brought to my attention with parents, with teachers, a lot is this idea of oppositionality, so they'll say the child is oppositional. And umm… to me… I have a love hate relationship with that word. Umm… The hate part of that word is that, I have found in every single case of work with, without exception that oppositional behavior was grounded in something legitimate like nervous system arousal and the child's oppositionality was an attempt to not feel dysregulated or an attempt to be successful in a way that didn't really end up working very well. I'll talk more about that, so if you're not really if you're going what is she talking about just stick with me and be patient, but I, I kind of hate that word oppositional because it's so… judgmental and its, had the meaning or the, the inference behind it is that there's a character flaw in the child or that they're a umm… bad child or a really difficult child and of course they really might be a difficult child. But there is a, umm… an avoidance that comes for adults when we have this label of opposition. The love part of that word in wrestling with that word is where this curiosity of looking beyond comes in because when I hear the, when someone tells me, this child is very oppositional, to me, I sort of light up because it's a mystery that needs to be solved. Umm… And so, it, it feels like an exciting challenge and I know that we can swim through the oppositional behaviors and get to what it is that's leading to the oppositionality. And if we can do that we can be so much more successful. Umm… So this is this is an, uh… an idea of what I'm talking about, about curiosity, curiously looking beyond the labels, looking beyond the behaviors to find out what's going on. And that requires us to swim through our assumptions, umm… and to swim through the behavior. I… taught a parenting group on Friday and I, my challenge to the parents in the group was to say, "I want you to think about your child's behaviors. The behaviors that are really problematic that you really struggle with, you feel really frustrated by that, you feel like, aren't changing even though you keep addressing them." Umm… And I want you to think about those behaviors as adaptations or strategies that the child uses for some reason. And so if we think about how as a system, we're all wired to… be self-regulated and to feel good inside, umm… we all for the most part, unless we have something seriously that has been seriously has been diagnosed. We all want to connect with others and please others and have people delight in us. And so, when a child's behavior doesn't meet those goals, when they, when their behavior actually umm… causes peers not to like them when their behavior causes teacher for the, causes them to get in trouble repeatedly, when their behavior causes their parents to be angry and frustrated with them over and over and over, then those behaviors run counter to what that child really wants and needs. So again, that's where we have to be really curious and say, "What is this child trying to do? What, what umm… adaptation is this behavior? Well, how is this behavior serving them?" A story I like to tell us about umm… a little boy at a school that I was working with and the little boy had gotten in trouble for saying the words, 'butt crack' in the library. Now, you're not allowed to say that in the library. It's inappropriate language for sure, but instead of just saying this child was just seeking attention or this child umm… is a behavioral problem or blaming the parents for being too permissive or whatever kinds of assumptions we make, or judgments we make, if we can really ask, "Hmm… what was that child trying to get and what, how did, how is that behavior adaptive for him in that moment?" And when we started peeling back the layers, it was really clear that this was a boy, a second grader who didn't know how to enter peer interactions very well. He had trouble with peers and I don't know if you're familiar with second grade children, but if you are, you know that saying 'butt crack' is the most hilarious thing, most of them have ever heard, they all die laughing and for this moment in time, this little boy was very successful socially. His behavior was an adaptation, his behavior was him saying, "This is the best strategy I have in the moment." And so what that leads us to this just say, "Ah… this kid showing us that he needs some better strategies." So, this is the idea that behavior itself oppositionality , avoidance et cetera, or adaptations, or manifestations of their best strategies and their best adaptations and anxiety is one of those things that leads to all kinds of avoidance, all kinds of reactivity, all kinds of emotional and behavioral things that can be really problematic for kids. And so if we think about the behavior as an adaptation or strategy, it's gonna to give us some better clues for how to build skills and what those kids need. And so the last part of this umm… slide number one is that we need to help parents and teachers see this lens as well. Teachers in particular as I interact with them umm… often just focus on the behavior umm… and a lot of parents are that way of course as well to end a lot of clinicians are too very behaviorally focused. Umm… And so one of the things that we can do is really become curious and try and make that curiosity contagious like, "Hmm… I wonder why he's doing that." I mean, this is a conversation I have all the time with parents and teachers and even other clinicians who, you know, asking me my thoughts on a case is to say, "Gosh, you know, that behavior is really interesting. What is it about it that's helping that child feel better or regulate their nervous system in some way?" Umm… And so, if we can help share that lens to move beyond just the down river behavior, survival kinds of things and to look at what's, what what's really happening in the whole river that can be really helpful. Okay, let's go on to our second slide umm… and just so you know as we're going through some of these slides I'm going to spend a lot more time on than others umm… and so that's uh… just okay to, too worried if we're taking too long and some of them. Umm… Slide number two is gonna be one that we spent quite a bit of time on here. What and we're gonna to talk quite a bit in just a few minutes about the nervous system and I'm so excited to share it with you because it has been fundamentally shifting in the work that I do and in the lens of a lot of the people that I've taught it to. Umm… So, slide number two here, we want to look for connections between the brain, the body, emotions, and behavior and I really want to encourage you to not forget the body. Depending on your training you may or may not have gotten much training umm… in looking at how the body umm… plays a role here, umm… I sure didn't and I was so thankful that I had the opportunity to study with Pat Ogden in the sensory motor psychotherapy approach. Umm… And Peter Levine's work umm… in somatic experiencing is also extremely helpful. Umm… One of the things that Pat Ogden has written about that I just love is that umm… uh… somebody asked her one time, "Why is it that you like working with the body?" And she said, "Well, there's no way around it." Umm… And I thought that was very clever and funny, but also she says that the body both reflects what's happening emotionally, cognitively, you know, the thoughts the beliefs, umm… the relational patterns and assumptions that have been wired since our early years like I believe, I can trust people and count on them or not our attachment kind of patterns, umm… as well as, how we're feeling emotionally umm…. and, and how much hope we have, umm… even our outlook like how much optimism or pessimism we have, or how much we sort of have a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset like Carol Dweck talks about that the body reflects, our internal state, and our early wiring even. But, the body does not only reflect it, but she says also sustains it and the way that we carry our bodies can actually reinforce or continue to help us or hurt us in terms of how we're feeling umm… and believing and thinking and acting. So, umm… we're gonna talk more about the body umm… later, but it's really important that we don't just look at the cognitions and the emotions which are sort of cortical and limbic, but we also look at this body. Now, as I mentioned earlier, there is often such a focus on the behavior and umm… I think we really short circuit the process and umm… don't really have as much capacity for lasting change if we're only focused on the behavior. The other problem with the, with, just focusing on behavior, I have to say is that, umm… you know, one of the things that I'm constantly challenging teachers and parents on right now which isn't always so well received, umm… but I still continue to talk about it because I think it's really important is that when we take a behavioral only view umm… where we're focused on road wards and consequences, there's a real problem that can ensue if what the child's if the problematic behavior is because the child doesn't have the ability to do it the right way some other time. If it's, in other words, if the child's behavior or the problematic situation is a 'can't' for the child instead of a 'won't' where the child is making a choice and we're offering rewards and consequences for something the child can't do, that's significantly problematic. Now, let's say more about that. So here's the… the story on this. Let's give an example. Umm… you know, a lot of teachers use umm… things in the classroom to uh… reinforce good behavior and encourage kids to kind of monitor themselves and sometimes those things can be really helpful and they work for a lot of children and they sort of umm… you know, promote and encourage good behavior, but an example of that would be umm… the kids names are written on the clothes pin and then there is a strip umm… of fabric or, or colored paper are on the wall and all the children start off in the green umm… area or the yellow sun shiny area, no, actually, it's usually green umm… and then if the child gets a warning, their paper clip gets moved to the yellow which is like warning, it's like a stop light situation. And then if the child has another infraction, they get moved to the red umm… the red zone. Now, umm… what I ask teachers is, I will say to them, "Do you find that the kids whose clothes pins get moved are almost always the same kids? Are almost always for the same kinds of behaviors? In fact, you've moved that kid's clothes pin so many times, the name has started to rub off on the clothes pin, but you know which one is his or hers." Umm… If that's the case and most teachers tell me, "Yes." And most parents for who use this behavioral kinds of systems as well almost say, "Yes, I'm having to work on the same behaviors over and over." From just a logical standpoint, if the point of this is to change behavior umm… and you're having to use it over and over on the same could be the same behavior, it's not working. So, that's enough reason to do something different. But, there's a bigger problem and that is that if the kid continues to get in trouble even though there is a consequence or he gets embarrassed or there's the note home or you know, she has to stay in after school or whatever the consequences are and they continue to do it, that's probably a reflection the, the child can't do what we're asking them to do at least for now. And so what that means is that we're punishing a child for something that they cannot help. It would be a like saying to a person with dyslexia, "If you don't read this quicker or if you have errors in your writing, you're gonna get in trouble, we're gonna move your clothes pin." We would never say that because we understand that the child has a legitimate reason for not being able to do what we're requiring. Maybe if someone else who does not have dyslexia. So, it's like we're punishing kids for things they can't help. Now, does that mean we don't do anything? No, of course not, what it means is that kid is telling you, "I need help here, I don't have a strategy, I don't have the skill." And so our whole job then is to build those skills and to work with the child umm… one of the umm… other PESI umm… speakers is Ross Greene and he's got this wonderful collaborative problem solving approach that can be really helpful in circumstances like this. I'd encourage you to check that out. So, instead of just focusing on the behavior, we wanna also look at the emotions, the brain umm… in terms of even cognitions and thoughts and beliefs, but also the body. So, I started this out by talking about going up river and swimming through the label, swimming through the behaviors, swimming through even the emotions and finding out, what could be leading to this anxiety? And I want to talk about what my experience of this, of this have been 'cause it's really different from what I learned in my professional training. What is causing anxiety? And I think one of the most helpful things in my work in terms of shifting, how I thought about and intervene with anxiety is to redefine anxiety as heightened nervous system arousal. Okay, and I'm going to break that down in just a minute. But, anxiety is heightened arousal. Your heart is beating more quickly, your eyes are, are more vigilant, you feel discomfort in your body and it's because of a hyper arousal that's happening. If we think about that, then we're gonna to be able to think about the whole thing differently. So our question shouldn't be what's causing the anxiety or, or what's producing the anxiety as much as it should be asking what is causing or producing this intense arousal. And I wanna talk to you about what my experiences have been and some of them will totally resonate with umm… your training and your own work and some of them you might not have thought about before and I hope that… that's the case because that makes this more fun to learn something new. Umm… Of course, we have to start with temperament umm… some children's umm… inborn temperaments are more sensitive, they have more heightened arousal from noise, from novel situations, from social interactions and that is just part of their inborn temperament that tends to be umm… highly genetic. Umm… One of the things that we know about temperament that's really interesting, if you read the whole brain child umm… you know that Dan and I have talked about right hemisphere and left hemisphere umm… and if you're familiar with Ian McGilchrist work, the master in his emissary, he's phenomenal talking about right brain and left brain asymmetry. Umm… I'd highly encourage you to look at his work as well. Umm… what we know about the right hemisphere is that, it is much more emotionally reactive, okay? And umm… and is much more closely connected to the body and for me both umm… understanding and receiving information from the body, but also in terms of umm… kind of being able to make some shifts in terms of that… that, umm… that information in the body. What we know about people who have a shier, more tentative more sensitive inborn temperament is that they have more right hemisphere activity. So, that right hemisphere umm… that leads to… that is where we have sort of more emotional reactivity, umm… and Dan and I talk about that as an emotional uh… tsunami umm… that there are going to be more prone to that emotional sort of flooding or reactivity and so umm… what happens is you put a kid with a non shy temperament and a child with a shy temperament in a novel situation, the one with the shyer temperament is going to have more of that emotional umm… sort of uh… reactivity umm… and intensity in the right hemisphere and in their body. So, that's helpful to know. Umm…. We also want to be careful about how we talk with kids about this because umm… it's so much better to say you're feeling shy as opposed to you are shy. Umm… Jerome Kagan's work, umm… showed that umm… kids who have a lot of this emotional reactivity and sensitivity that makes things overwhelming and not comfortable for them that… that could be shifted over time. This actual foundational temperament umm… parents could have an impact on that. What he found was that, if parents pushed kids too hard, too fast, it actually cause them to stay even more trapped in the discomfort of umm… their reactivity in novel situations and in social situations, but if parents didn't push at all and they just let kids kind of not push themselves outside their comfort zone, they also stayed sort of umm… inhibited by or umm… uh… imprisoned by the limits of the reactivity that went with that, but what he found was that, parents who pushed a little bit with a lot of nurturing and kind of incremental like, well, let's just try it or let's just go for two minutes or let's take three steps towards it and I'll go with you or those kinds of things, parents who incrementally with a lot of nurturing help kids kind of expand their experience of tolerating these uncomfortable experiences that those kids actually had some mastery over and were able to kind of overcome the limits of that discomfort that came with that temperament. Umm… and the way I think about his work is umm… in terms of nervous system arousal. We'll come back to this in a minute when I show you a, a chart, but I understand if parents push too hard, it flood, the nervous system goes, "Oh, my gosh, this is unbearable, this feels terrible to me. My heart's beating so fast, I'm sweaty, I'm feeling really chaotic and really uncomfortable. This is too much." So then the kids are like, I'm avoiding that. I'm not only am I avoiding that, but I'm avoiding the thing I did, you know, yesterday because all of the time comfortable. So, it's counterproductive if we push too hard. But, if we don't push it all, we don't widen their tolerance for sitting with some discomfort and realizing it was worth it and it was okay. Umm… I was giving a… a PESI workshop actually umm… I believe I was, I don't remember which city I was in. Umm… But, someone in the audience said, and she said, "I call that a balance of pushing and cushion." And I really like that. I wish I remembered her name so I could give her credit, but it's this idea of really balancing pushing and cushion. Umm… some kids need more cushion, others need more push in and of course that changes over development as well. As kids get older they can tolerate more push in, umm… but that's actually a good way to think about it. So, temperament may make a child vulnerable to umm… anxiety or kind of nervous system arousal in certain circumstances. The next one is, somewhat thinking that won't be new to you and I don't need to say much about it is this idea of trauma. Umm… If a child has had traumatic… traumatic experience or a chronic trauma or relationally or in some other capacity, umm… their nervous system has been wired to become hyper vigilant and reactive under certain, certain circumstances, I don't have time to go into umm… sort of implicit memory and neural networks and all of that. If you're interested in that I would highly recommend umm… reading Dan Siegel's work. Umm… but the idea is that when umm… or Ogden's work would be amazing as well. Umm… when we have had a trauma experience, our brain is hyper alert for safety and so small things that don't feel like threat to someone who has not had trauma may umm… activate all kinds of anxiety systems that are very much body based and lower brain based as well and so that would be something that I always screened for obviously is to look if there is trauma history that could be a big part of this. A third thing is something that I had no training for that I umm… only accidentally happened upon umm… as especially I was working in my role at a school umm… where I was starting to interact with more and more occupational therapists and I was interacting with more and more kids who had sensory sensitivities or sensory integration challenges and the next one after that and I'm not done talking about sensory, but the next one after that I'm calling a learning discrepancy. You're seeing that on your slide and I have to say I'm gonna lump those together for just a minute. Umm… it may be unique to the populations I work with, but I don't think so because as I've gone around traveling and talking with people, I'm having a lot of nods in the audience and a lot of conversations with school counselors and clinicians at lots of places that I visit who are saying I'm seeing this too. Umm… and that is my experience I'm totally going to make up a statistic right now, umm… but it feels accurate to me but I haven't it's not actually legit stats. Umm… I would say that about 80% to 85% of the kids that I've worked with in some capacity, who struggle with anxiety, either have a sensory sensitivity or a learning discrepancy, I'll talk about the learning discrepancy next, but let's stay with sensory. Umm… sensory, umm… if you don't have a good grounding in or even a little familiarity with sensory integration or sensory sensitivities, I highly encourage you to dig into that. Umm… spdfoundation.net is Sensory Processing Disorders Foundation and they have a wealth of resources. I'd highly recommend that, but one thing that's really interesting for the first time ever out of the University of San Francisco, uh… Medical Center, they actually did the very first study in this as a result of the study came out maybe I'm thinking umm… 2012, 2013 very recently umm… that showed for the first time actual differences in terms of brain connectivity in kids who had sensory sensitivities or sensory integration or sensory processing disorders versus the control group and what they found was that the somatosensory cortex which is this part of our brain here the outer sensory areas umm… was the less connected. Now, this is really interesting, umm… you may be familiar with umm… sensory sensitivities if you work with children who are on the spectrum, this is something that goes hand in hand a lot of times with spectrum disorders, but it is also something umm… that is quite pervasive umm… that a lot of people don't know to watch for or look for. So umm… and it's interesting when… when… I bring it up with parents they, you know I have to do a lot of psycho education because they you know sometimes get concerned that I'm saying that their child is on the spectrum when that's not at all the case umm… in my umm… sessions as I'm doing sort of an intake, I often ask some sensory questions and you can get these from spdfoundation.net some of you may be familiar with the books umm… "The Out-of-Sync Child" or umm… "The Highly Sensitive Child" both of those are great resources as well to kind of help you construct some screening questions. Now, I know I'm not trained as an occupational therapist so I'm not at all doing a full a evaluation, but I do… do… some screening to let me know whether or not I should refer the child to an occupational therapist for a full sensory screening evaluation. Umm… umm… I hope that more and more neuron psychologists or educational psychologists who do educational evaluations will take this as part of their umm… full evaluations, very few of them do. Umm… But, it's really important because umm… the kinds of questions I ask just as a… as a… quick thing as you know, of course I ask about sensitivity to noise and I ask about this umm… from their early infancy through the current age that they're at. I ask umm… the… the… one question that seems to have a lot of parents go, "Oh, my gosh, yes, how did you know?" Is to ask about the seams of their socks, I ask about socks and underwear. Umm… a lot of kids who have sensory sensitivities have the tactile umm… sensitivity to the seams of their socks, like the parents who have bought lots of different kinds umm… but this seems always seem to rub them the wrong way umm… parents even sometimes buy seamless socks, but they still irritate their children. Umm… tags particularly umm… with underwear and as you kind of start to explore this with parents, one of the other questions I often ask is, "Do you have battles with your child around getting dressed in the morning?" And of course, sometimes that's just there are other reasons around that, but umm… that can be a really helpful kind of entry into asking about this. Of course, we can talk about textures of food. Umm… other things we can look for if you can break down sensory into sensory avoid, avoidance or sensory averse and sensory seeking, kids who love to slam into things, or umm… a rock, or ride really fast, or swing really high, umm… there are seeking sensory input and that's also a sign of a sensory processing challenge potentially. So, these are some of the things I ask about and why is this related to… to anxiety? Why do I see so much sensory stuff related to anxiety? Nervous system arousal, if you have sensory sensitivities and I'm using that sort of as an umbrella for lots of different things, then the feeling of your, so one of the things I do with parents is I'll say, right now, just even you can do this as you're watching this uh… webinar is to notice the feeling of your shoes on your feet and notice the feeling of your waistband umm… around your waist or the feeling of the seams around and under your arms and when I ask you to bring your attention to that, you're noticing how that feels and that kind of pulls your attention a little bit. But, unless you yourself have some sensory sensitivities you might not have thought about it or not, it might not be part of your umm… awareness or your umm… experience. Kids who have sensory sensitivities umm… will often it's almost like your nervous system is bombarding you with that discomfort of that feeling all day long similar to when you're sunburned and all day long you're aware of how uncomfortable you feel in your skin that is similar to the experience of some of these kids depending on the intensity. So, if sound floods you or the feeling of clothes floods you or there's different things like that that actually cause you to not be able to gauge that out umm… and it's providing input into your nervous system all day long, it can actually make you in a more heightened nervous system arousal which leads you prone to anxiety. And one of the things that often happens is kids who have sensory sensitivities and there's a lot of movement and noise and tactile and sensory things that bombard them all day long at school, umm… they can hold themselves together all day long at school but the minute they climb into your car at the end of the day as a parent they may fall apart and be lashing out emotionally and really reactive. Umm… A couple of suggestions for that one is umm… kids have tend to have umm… dehydrated and have low blood sugar when they get picked up so handing them a snack right away, but also if you can find a ball that is big enough to be wedged down between the seats and obviously if your kids are really long legged or older this won't be safe for younger kids, umm… so it's not small enough that it can be thrown around the car as a projectile where it's not saved umm… you can wedge a ball down there and when they climb in and get in their seat they'll put their feet on the ball and start pushing on it, it's a great trick I learned from an occupational therapist that helps kind of regulate and calm down the nervous system. Occupational Therapists have a lot of great tools for us, a lot of umm… great ways to help kids with kids who have attentional issues or who have heightened motor activity like as in ADHD kinds of things, umm… I suggest having them do homework on one of those big exercise balls that can be really helpful. So umm… find out and dig a little bit deeper into understanding more about the sensory world. Now, this other thing I said was a huge contributor in my experience in terms of anxiety is learning discrepancy. What I mean by that is, if a child has umm… a cognitive skill that is really strong, they may also have a cognitive skill that is not strong at all compared to that other skill. Now, I know I didn't say that very articulately stay with me. What I mean by that is, if I, what I've seen over and over and over again on neuropsychological evaluations with kids who have anxiety is that there is a mis, mismatch between their cognitive abilities. So, for instance, they might have a really high IQ, maybe even in the gifted range. so let's say their umm… perceptual reasoning or their verbal comprehension is way… way up like in the gifted range or really high average. Umm… But, their processing speed or their working memory and these are the two that I see most frequently in this umm… in this kind of umm… a kid is high IQ, high verbal comprehension, high perceptual reasoning, but average or below average working memory or processing speed and it's the discrepancy between these that… that… can lead to the anxiety because the child is very smart and umm… is aware that they're missing things or that things aren't coming for them like they do for other children and it can create this intensity. So, let me talk about that a little bit more umm… any time I see a kid who has anxiety I'm always curious about this umm… sometimes we call these kids depending on what the profile actually reveals kids who are twice exceptional or 2e kids where umm… let me give an example, umm… one kid that I worked with who umm… had umm… he was in the gifted range in terms of his IQ, umm… but his processing speed was like in the 14th percentile. So, his verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning were in the 90's percentiles, but his… his… processing speed was in like the 14 or 15th percentile. So, you know, I think a lot about umm… Ned Hallowell's umm… analogy for kids with ADHD about how they have like a " Ferrari engine, but it's on a bicycle. That's what it kind of feels like for kids like this is that, the rate at which they can process information is slower, but they're extremely intelligent and so you could see how that frustration could lead to nervous system arousal and anxiety or this working memory piece. Working memory has many components to it but the two that are most helpful to talk about here are one being able to hold on to a number of things. So, it's like the working chalkboard of the mind right umm… remembering umm… seven things, plus or minus, so let's say a child's teacher gives them a four or five step direction. First, I want you to do this and then don't forget to put your name on it and then you need to flip it over to the back side et cetera they give them a series of instructions for the child to be able to hold on to all of those and use them as needed is a working memory task. It's also, working memory is also taking what you already know and being able to apply it in a new context. If a child has umm… a working memory that isn't compatible with their other cognitive skills, that can also create a lot of distress and nervous system arousal and anxiety umm… and when that anxiety comes, then sometimes the kids miss even more directions or even more of what's going on and it leads to what my colleague, (inaudible ) has a really phenomenal Educational therapist calls Swiss cheese learning. So it's like they get these holes, umm… so just because like, just because the kid is really smart and they're super capable does not mean they don't have a learning discrepancy, right? Now, sometimes it's that the kid has an actual learning disability, a reading disability, umm… or dysgraphia or dyslexia or umm… or they have something like ADHD and they're gifted. So, sometimes we see these kinds of things, but even a child who really compensates well, for umm… for themselves and makes their own accommodations who doesn't look like they have a learning challenge, this can still be an underlying issue for kids who have anxiety. We start seeing it more and more umm… in fourth, fifth, sixth grade is when a lot of this kind of stuff emerges. So, if a kid has umm… he's starting to say, "I don't like school," or having a lot of anxiety around this age, a lot of reactivity when it comes to homework or doing schoolwork, umm… maybe even a version or a lot of reactivity, this might be a question you might want to explore is to umm… recommend a neuropsychological evaluation, umm… to find out if there is a learning discrepancy. Now, one thing I can I'm wondering if you're thinking about a minute ago I said, they could be have a really high in one area and average or below average you're thinking, well, if it's average, "Why is that a problem?" It's a problem if there's more than two standard deviations between one skill and another and so one might be average, but it still significantly different from one of the really high other areas. I hope that makes sense. So, umm… one of the ways I kind of encourage parents to take on this idea of going through a neuropsychological evaluation because as you know they are time consuming and expensive, some in times insurance covers them and other times not umm… but if kids are in the school district, umm… but they're not significantly impaired, the school district may not pay for it, so it may be an out of pocket expense for parents. Umm… although I've had a lot of success umm… working with umm… students who are training, who are being supervised by someone to get umm… low fee evaluations is to say there's something that may be causing this anxiety and your child's self image or their self-esteem is potentially being impacted by this discrepancy. Umm… And the way I talk about it is to say, it might be really interesting to find out who your kid is as a learner. And I'll tell you that in my experience, when a child is brought into the process in terms of the feedback and explaining to them what we find about how their brain works and what kind of a learner they are, just that sharing with them to say, " Have you ever noticed that your brain does really well with these, this kind of work, but this kind of work is much harder for you." And of course, I'm being generalized because every child's profile is different. Umm… Have you ever noticed that, well, that's because this area is a strength for you, but this area is kind of weaker for you and just explaining that to them, I've had so many experiences where there is such relief that goes with knowing that, with naming it, with understanding that about themselves, I've had kids say, "Oh, I'm not dull, I'm actually really smart, but I don't learn with, in this kind of way or that's how my, no wonder that so hard for me and there is tremendous anxiety reduction just in the knowing for many of the kids I've worked with. So, for what that's worth. The next thing on our list is an emotion, an environmental discrepancy. What I mean by that is that the demands of the environment and the child's capacity don't match. Now, sometimes that's as simple as a child has a temperament umm… where they're more of an introvert, they need more down time, they need time at home without a lot of chaos, umm… although sometimes homes are full of chaos, but they need time to regroup on their own, but the family schedule is such that they are rarely home. The house is like an loading and unloading zone, there is no haven for this child, this child is way over scheduled et cetera. And the stress of that, demand of too much scheduled and too much going umm… and maybe even not enough sleep doesn't match what this child needs to function optimally and everybody has a different set point. So, sometimes it's that if we can tinker with the schedule, we can tinker with the amount of sleep et cetera. Umm… And then other times it's that the expectation in a classroom is to sit quietly and listen and that might be an appropriate expectation depending on the age of the kids and how long we're asking them to do it or it may be an inappropriate expectation. There are a lot of classrooms that don't give kids enough time to move or to play and we ask them to sit still for way too long umm… and some kids can do it and some kids can't, but the… the… actual demand is not appropriate. Whether the demand in the classroom is appropriate or not, some kids can't do it. Even if it's an appropriate demand, some kids cannot sit and attend the way that most of the other kids in the class can. What we are talking about here is the demand of the environment and the child's capacity don't fit and when that happens, kids can have the nervous system arousal and anxiety and sometimes even lead to depression umm… and self-esteem issues. What this means though when we think about it through this lens in terms of our interaction, our intervention is that, we either need to reduce the demands of the environment if possible or we need to expand the child's capacity. So the demands the environment are here, the kids capacity is here in whatever… whatever… situation it is, whether it's an attentional demand or uh… bodily control umm… controlling body movement or impulse control or whatever it is. Umm… the demands are here and the child's capacity is here. We either need to reduce the demands or we need to build the child's capacity and sometimes both is the best answer. Sometimes, we can't change the demands of the environment, sometimes we have to only work with the child, but again it goes back to this idea of skill building and giving them capacities or strategies to help manage those. Stressful environment, I have just talked about, sometimes kids are anxious and have nervous system arousal because they are constantly bathed in stress. Umm… Sometimes this has to do with conflict happening between parents, umm… you know, a divorce on the horizon, umm… chronic illness of a sibling or a parent, death in the family, uh… recent one, whatever it is, but sometimes the environment itself is stressful and again we can go back to this idea, can we reduce the stress in the environment? Can we give parents better skills themselves so that there are emotionally less reactive and be can become more of a secure base or an emotional Haven themselves for the child? Or if not, then again, we go back to teaching kids strategies to help calm themselves down to kind of manage the stress better. Umm… I'm uh… I'm thinking about how, you know, parents may not think about their kids' behavior as anxiety, umm… and uh… it's interesting, you know, especially in my experience with boys who parents come in or they'll say, "Well, my kid has a temper issue or he has an anger issue." The underbelly for that is anxiety and sometimes it has to do with just a stressful environment that we can make adaptations to or adjustments to. Umm… The last one here after my et cetera because for other kids it might be other things on the list, umm… it could be having to do with peer like the et cetera is gonna be maybe umm… some social skills kinds of issues where they… they… struggle with their interaction with peers. But, this caregivers who amplify distress or arousal is a really important one. And I'm going to talk more about that in just a couple of minutes, but if you have a child who maybe has one or two of these other things that we've talked about umm… or who doesn't, but when the child goes into emotional distress as we all do just normally in the course of upsetting things happen or we sort of lose our umm… our umm… ability to regulate ourselves, umm… parents or caregivers who amplify the distress can be umm… can cause ongoing umm… anxiety, because the child then believes and it gets wired into the child that I don't have someone who can soothe me and call me down, umm… I'm on my own in that way because my parent actually makes things worse and of course umm… this is very much what we see with umm… anxious ambivalent attachment, umm… or especially with disorganized attachment that the caregiver who is supposed to be the one that the child instinctually goes to for soothing in peace and calming is actually the one that… that… is causing or amplifying the distress and so this is actually a dynamic we want to look at as well. So, these are among many other reasons why anxiety may be there and of course there are the genetic vulnerabilities that may run in the family, there may be some modeling for parents who are anxious and who respond to things that interest well ways, but this is the list that I find myself kind of going to over and… over and… over of umm… things that I'm seeing are contributing to this. Okay, so number three on our slides here umm… one of the ways that I talk with kids and parents and teachers as well about anxiety is the, is… is in a really positive lens and that is to say that the body and the brain's priority is to get a need met and so I said talk to kids and I… I… want them to see their anxiety as a message. So, one of the things I might say is that, how cool is it that your body is telling you that something isn't working for you. This is that adaptiveness kind of lens right to think about the behavior of adaptation. So, if I can say to the kid, "Wow your body is telling you something, your body is saying, 'this isn't working for me, this feels too stressful, this is too uncomfortable, that's kind of cool that your body is telling you that and your emotions are telling you that.'" So, if we think about it as a message that can be really, really helpful so if we help them recognize negative emotions or anxiety as messages sent by the body and brain and then we can honor those messages and say, "Wow, they're telling us something. Well, what can we do? How can we respond to that? How can we change the situation? et cetera." I'm thinking right now about Kelly McGaugh Nichols work on stress. Umm… Some of you may be familiar with her TED talk or with her book or her work, umm… where she asked people to rate their level of stress. And so they said, I have low stress, moderate stress, high stress. Umm… And then she asked to kind of understand what their… what their… stress narrative was, or what their beliefs were, I guess the better way to say it. Umm… Did they believe that stress was harmful to them and hard on them and bad? Or did they believe that stress was positive or helped them in some way? And what they found was that the people who had who rated themselves as having high stress umm… were much more likely to die in… in… like, I think it was the next five years. They looked at death records. Unless they had the belief that stress was positive in some way that helped mobilize them and help them get things done, it was a helpful force in their lives. Even if they had high stress, if that was their belief, there were no more likely to die than the people who said they had low stress. Now, that's phenomenal. Isn't it that a belief actually made a difference in terms of life and death? This is how we can use this with kids with anxiety is to say, "What you believe about your anxiety matters, right?" So, when they, when they're… when… there are, if we say, "Your body is sending you a message, let's listen to that, that's really helpful because it tells us what we need to do to change things. So giving them a narrative or a… a… shift in belief around the anxiety can be so helpful and again I'd encourage you to go to Carol Dwecks work around growth mindset. Umm… She uses the word umm… "Yet" and we're gonna talk more about that in promoting this growth mindset. So, help kids recognize that anxiety is a message and I think at the other part of this is so important is that the number one most important thing for our entire brains and nervous systems is safety and so we can talk to kids about that, "Ha… your… your… body and brain is telling you something here and maybe it's telling you that you actually don't feel very safe." And that safety is going to umm… trump everything. So, if a kid is avoiding a behave… avoiding doing something it's probably because they're nervous system is telling them that it's not safe to do that thing for some reason. And so umm… the child saying, "I… I can't go there," and so we can actually reconstruct a narrative around safety that helps that belief starts shifting what's happening. Okay, so number four, we want to teach families about neural plasticity or how the brain changes and how kids can change their own brains by understanding and listening to and shifting what that anxiety is doing. This is such a message of hope and I wanna to tell you a story about how I umm… I worked with this idea and how I did that. Okay, so, I wanna talk to you about a girl, I'm calling Sierra and of course I'm changing details and names umm… to protect my patients. Umm… Sierra was umm… one of my earliest umm… patients that I worked with and I was really entrenched in studying the brain at the time in neural plasticity. Umm… Sierra had been having panic attacks since about the time she was six and umm… she would have panic attacks probably five times a week and sometimes they were not full blown panic attacks umm… and other times they were completely debilitating where she thought she was actually dying, you know, like almost going to the emergency room time kind of thing and sometimes she would even have them at school and she would excuse herself and go to the bathroom and have them in the bathroom umm… and if she was at home, she would sometimes have them under her covers so her parents didn't know. Umm… And then other times she would have them full blown in the… in the… face of her parents, umm… but she umm… there were, it's not even really important to go into the details, she did have umm… you know, her father abandoned her when she was a baby, a very attached umm… securely attached, secure attachment relationship with her mom, but who also struggled with anxiety and models a lot of umm… chaos and anxiety about the world. She also had some health issues that haven't been able to be diagnosed and that led to a lot of umm… distress umm… and uh… she really struggled with kind of catastrophic thinking and other kinds of things that go with anxiety. So, when she first came to me, umm… I started working with her umm… on more down river things. I wanted to immediately give her some strategies to help her not be suffering so much. Umm… I sometimes get frustrated when I hear about people who have been going to therapy and they've been umm… uh… you know, trying to sort of umm… create a coherent narrative and go back and uncover sort of the.. the past history or they're doing play therapy where the child, they're sort of following the child's lead umm… in allowing things to present themselves as the child needs to kind of wrestle with them and I love those approaches. I use both of those a lot in my work, but I think when someone is coming to us and they're really suffering, it's neglectful for us to not start giving them some strategies and tools right away to alleviate. It's like if you go into the emergency room in pain and they're doing all of these things to investigate where the pain is coming from that's essential, but we need to give them some pain relief too. So, that's where I started with her and I used a workbook that I use a lot that I love it's by Dawn Huebner, H-U-E-B-N-E-R called umm… "What To Do When You Worry Too Much," some of you are familiar with her and she's got several other workbooks about temper and there's one on OCD called "What To Do When Your Brain Gets Stuck," she's got some great tools in there. But, it's basically you know some great strategies or tools to use for kids and one of the ones I had used out of the book although we used many was the idea that you have a worry bully that sits on your shoulder and one of the things you can do is to argue with that worry bully. Umm… And so I had taught her that we'd practice that we had drawn what her worry bully looked like, we'd kind of done some role play about how the worry bully might whisper a worry like your, you know, "You're gonna forget your… your… homework umm… at home today and not bring it to school." And then how she could argue with it back so we had done some of that, the other thing I had taught her umm… was actually it worked with her and her mom on this, umm… as you know kids who struggle with anxiety going to sleep can be challenging at night because their brain does all that umm… spiraling and worrying and all of that. So umm… we had talked about some ways to kind of move away from that, but then I… I said to her, her momma said, "You know that space between all your worries thoughts are going… going… going… and you're talking and you're asking worry questions and you're thinking about worries and then there's that, so there's that moment and then there's the moment when you fall asleep. And I said there's a… a… little moment between there where your body starts to relax, your breath gets deeper, and you start noticing your body kind of getting floppy and relaxed and your mind quiets down. And so we kind of had, I said, "What does that look like, you know, when you're doing that?" I had her kind of embody it on the couch and… and… I said, "Mom, you know that moment when you're lying down with her and you're seeing that happen." And they could kind of identify and I said, "I want you to, when that moment begins to put a hand on your chest and to put a little bit of extra weight there." So Mom you can put your hand on her or you can put a little stuffed animal or something like that on top of your head and provide a little bit of weight right there on your chest and I want you to do that every night only when you're in that really peaceful place. And I want you to do that for a few weeks and so every week when Sierra would come back to me, I would say Are you still doing the thing at night and I would check in with Mom. "Yeah, we're still doing it. And I would say, "Great, that's the only time I want you to use it, but I want you to keep doing it." And based on what I know about neural plasticity, umm… I know that it takes about four weeks or so for us to even have the chance of beginning to see some changes in terms of connectivity in the brain although Richard Davidson has been seeing umm… some function some actual changes, structural changes in the brain after just three weeks umm… using mindfulness so that's kind of exciting. Umm… So anyway, I had Sierra do this every night and after about a month, she came in and I am ready to umm… kind of really track what happens with her. So, she sits down and I say, "Show me how you do that thing at night with your hand." And I'm watching, I'm paying extra attention to see what happens next. So, she puts her hand on her chest and instantly she goes like this. Huh… and her whole, her breath changes, her whole posture gets floppy as if she's very… very… relaxed. Now, she didn't do this but I've used this technique with a lot of kids that I've worked with and some parents too. Umm… and I would say probably about 60% of them will actually start yawning when I have them do this, because it's gotten linked umm… in terms of their nervous system and brain. So, she does this and she goes huh… and it's automatic and I say to her, "Wow, did you see what just happened? What do you notice about your body right now? What happened with your breath?" And I bring her attention to what has happened when she puts her hand there. And I said, "Do you know what you have? This… this… is this amazing tool that you have with you all the time and any time you're starting to feel that anxiety, now your brain has wired that when you do this, huh… you can feel relaxed." So, that's a tool you have. So, that was one of the things and she called it umm… "Doing her breaths" huh… okay, so after I've been working with her a few months, she came bounding into my waiting room one day and she said, "I did it." And I said, "Great, but you did what?" And she said, "I stopped myself from having a panic attack today." And she was so enthusiastic, she didn't even wait to tell me all of this in my office, because there were other people in the waiting room and I said, "Oh, let's go talk about it in my office." So, we went into my office and I said, "Tell me the story, tell me what happened?" She said, "Well…" and she's starting to embody the worry of the beginning of this part of the story and she says, "Well, I forgot my lunch money and I started thinking, 'Oh, no. Everyone's gonna see that I didn't have my lunch money and it's gonna be so embarrassing and I'm gonna be the only one sitting there not eating and everyone's gonna notice and I'm gonna be so hungry, I'm not gonna be able to pay attention in class this afternoon and I probably won't learn anything and then I won't do well on the test and then I realized, you know, I'm not gonna probably know the homework.'" And I said, "Wow, that was the year, you were really worrying, you were kind of going higher and higher and higher and you're worried." I said, "So, how did you go from there to not having a panic attack, what happened? So she was doing that anxious spiral thinking, she said, "Well, I argued with the worry bully and I said, 'it's no big deal, I can just borrow money from my friend. She always has money and I'll just buy lunch today.'" And I said, "And then what?" She said, "And then I flicked the worry bully off my shoulder and I stepped on him." And that was not something I had taught her, I just, but I loved her fierceness with kind of overpowering this worry bully. Umm… I said, "And then what happened?" She said, "And then huh… I did my breaths." And I said, "And then?" And she said, "And then I relaxed and had a good day." And what I did for her and you'll see on this slide was I drew a mountain, just basically an arc and then of course I'm thinking about nervous system arousal and how we have these kind of arcs of arousal how our… our… nervous arousal can kind of get more and more intense and at some point of peaks and then we come down into lower states of arousal. But, that's not how I was using this with her. I drew the mountain and what I said to her is as your worries got bigger and bigger and bigger, this time in the past, it's like you went up to the top of worry mountain and when you would get to the top of worry mountain and your worries got big enough and you were up there, there was a sled sitting at the top of that mountain and you see on the sheet there it says, anxiety and worry with an X there and then a really kind of thick line and I said, "What happened is every time you worried a lot you would end at the top of worry mountain and there was a sled up there. You would have anxiety and worry and you would get in that sled and you would go down the mountain and you would land in panic attack. And the next time you had really big worries, the same thing happened. You were at the top and you went down on the same path, you got on that sled and you went down the same path because that was the path that was already there. And you did that over and… over and… over until that was the only path that your brain knew to, then you I'm sorry, that was the only path that you knew to go down. It was the only path on the mountain. And so every time you went down that path you landed in the same place, panic attack. And I said, but you know what you did today and you see I wrote up there coping thoughts which was her arguing with her worry bully and two breaths, those were the things she called them. So I wrote number one and number two on there and I drew an arrow and I put a new X on the other and on. Laid out another part of that mountain and I said, "You know what you did today?" I said, "You used your coping thoughts and your breaths and you picked up that sled and you went to a new spot on the mountain and you went down a brand new path and you went down that and you landed in relax and good day. Those again were her words. And I said, you know what's so amazing about this is that next time your worries get big and you end up on top of that mountain, you, you're gonna be, it's gonna to be easier to go down the panic attack path because that's what you're used to. But you know you can use these tools and some of the others we have talked about, but you can pick up your sled. It might be harder but you can do it and you can go to this new spot and go down that path and what's so cool about this is that the snow will continue to fall and if you keep going down your new path that leads to relax and have a good day, the snow will cover up your panic attack path and the path that will be on the top of your worry mountain will only be the relax and have a good day, managing and handling your emotion and your anxiety. And I said, "This is how your brain works. Did you know that this is how the connections in your brain work right now." Right now, the connections between worry and panic attack a really strong, just like this path on this piece of paper. But, if you keep going down the new path, those are the connections that are going to get stronger and the panic attack path or connections are gonna get weaker and weaker and weaker and dissolve. And so just like this, that's how your brain works. This was a 9 or 10 year old little girl who totally got this. We can explain this message of hope and this idea of neural plasticity and how the brain changes from these new experiences by tolerating umm… anxiety or worry through some new strategies and tools. So, I hope this will be something that will be helpful for you as you're explaining. I use this analogy all the time with parents who come in who talk about their child's tantrums or who talk about some sort of bad habit their child has or even with parents in terms of their own emotional anger or reactivity with their children that they want to change. So, hopefully that will be helpful to you. So number five, umm… by understanding mental and even neural associations and as I have mentioned kids can, they can more effectively respond to what happens with their emotions and bodies and relationships. So, we can talk about how the brain makes these connections and we can ask them, "What goes together for you? Or what happens when?" So like, I might ask, "What happens when you get to school and you get home from school and you realize that you don't have the book that you need?" And then oftentimes their eyes look at bigger, their bodies will show something and I work with that, I say, "Oh, what goes with that is your eyes get bigger, your body gets really still you… you… tense up and what's happening in terms of your heart, what's happening in terms of your breath umm… what feelings do you have, what emotions do you have, so you can even use prompts of specific situations. Umm… I worked with a girl who umm… was umm… had decided that she was gonna to refuse to go to sleep away camp umm… because she had had umm… well, two different cases I'm thinking about. Umm… in one in particular, she had umm… been sick and had to take this medication that made her really sleepy and umm… she actually had like a bed… bed… wetting accident umm… and she was nine and she hadn't had one since she was like four or five or six or something like that and it wasn't an ongoing problem as a one time occurrence. But because of that she was just paralyzed from thinking about going to sleep away camp in case it happened again. Now, that's understandable, umm… but it was keeping her from doing something that could be an amazing experience for her. So that might be something I work with. I might say, "Hmm… what goes together with that?" Umm… If you think about that happening, what happens in terms of your thoughts? What happens in terms of your emotions? What happens in terms of your body? Umm… And we can really work with those umm… I also had a little girl who was umm… had some significant compulsive umm… I'm sorry not compulsive, obsessive thinking umm… around peanut butter there was a boy in her school who was allergic to peanuts and it was a peanut free school and so they weren't allowed to bring peanut, anything to school or tree nuts to school. Umm… but the family had no issues with it and so they would, mom would often use peanut butter in breakfast in the morning and this little girl became so frightened and anxious about what if I accidentally have a little bit of peanut butter on my fingers that doesn't come off if I wash or if it gets on my clothes and I accidentally get it on my backpack and my backpack accidentally touches his backpack and then he's gonna die. So, this was the kind of thinking that… that… was pervasive not just for this for several other things that might be something that we could look at and talk about how these associations or the paths that we talked about umm… on the things how those get wired up and we can talk to kids and teach them about that, what goes together for you? What happens when this happens? And then pull it together. Pat Ogden talks about stitching, so she stitches together cognitions, thoughts, beliefs, emotions and I'm pointing to structural areas in the brain where this happens and bodily reactivity. So, those are that's another thing we can think about. Number six, now, I've been talking about the nervous system for an hour now, but let's really get into it. This is so helpful I think. What we wanna do is track nervous system arousal to really watch it and teach families about how to help kids move back into the right amount of arousal, not too much arousal, hyper arousal and not too little arousal or hypo arousal. To move them back into an optimal zone for wellbeing and happiness. So, let's go to this next slide that, where you see the three bands of color versus threat and, "Threat at the top." Now, I have to give credit umm… this umm… chart here and what I'm about to talk about is based on about 10 or 12 different peoples work, umm… I've been umm… heavily influenced here by umm… Dan Siegel's uh… "Window of Tolerance," umm… by uh… Stephen Porges's "Polyvagal Theory," by Pat Ogden's "Optimal Zone of Arousal," umm… and I'm… I'm… thinking also about umm… the occupational therapy world where they talk about umm… the "How Does Your Engine Run?" umm… system running too hot, running too cold umm… and Leah Kiper's who umm… has a book called "Zones Of Regulation" that is phenomenal. Umm… A work, but that helps kids sort of see which zone they're in and hers looks different she has I think a yellow zone, umm… and also Jenny's Turnbull and Conny Willis's book, umm… uh… where they talk about umm… something similar. They actually turn their chart diagonally and they have umm… they also have a yellow zone as well, so and there's probably other people that I can't even think of, but this is my iteration of it that I have been teaching and… and… that I find very helpful. What you're seeing here as… as… we go up into the red zone and the upper Green Zone, what we're talking about is arousal going up and by nervous system arousal, I mean, of course the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the nervous system. As you might remember, the sympathetic is like the gas pedal, it rubs us up and the parasympathetic is like the brakes that calmness down. Umm… And of course Steven Portis talks about how that's not the whole story and that umm… that, we, this "Polyvagal Theory" kind of go, goes further umm… where sympathetic and parasympathetic and when that fails us we go into these immobilized States which should be kind of deep into the blue which we'll talk about in a minute. Umm… but sympathetic and parasympathetic is like the gas pedal and the brakes and when our gas pedal and brakes are sympathetic and parasympathetic are well balanced, we're in the Green Zone. And when we're in the Green Zone, our social engagement circuitry is on, Stephen Porges talks quite a bit about that, umm… or we have sound judgment, our learning circuitry is on, we can actually learn, umm… and self-regulation can happen. Okay, so even if we're upset, even if we're worried, if we're anxious of or mad, umm… we're feeling bored, we're feeling kind of down and in the blues, as long as our nervous system arousal is still kind of in that well functioning optimal place, we handle ourselves well. We can learn we can engage with others, we can modulate our own states of arousal until we can't. Umm… If our nervous system arousal gets too aroused, so we go into hyper arousal, so the sympathetic is much more active, we go into the red zone. And when we're in the red zone umm… things change and let's just look obviously emotionally we may be feeling more anxious, more panicky, more angry, umm… more chaotic emotionally, but physiologically what we're gonna see happen is when we're in states of hyper arousal, the muscles get really tight and tense, the heart rate increases, the eyes may dilate and, or get wider actually. Umm… And we are ready to do fight, flight or freeze and by freeze I mean, umm… what's called high freeze, so it's more like a deer in the headlights where we're like this, but we're still in states of mobilization where we can run or fight if we need to. Umm… So the muscles get really tense, eyes get bigger, emotion gets bigger, heart rate increases, sometimes the skin turns red or blotchy, sometimes we get hot or sweaty. So physiologically, this hyper arousal manifests itself. Umm… This is where we see a lot of kids going when they're in states of anxiety. Now, let's drop down to the opposite of that and that is this blue zone and in the blue zone where in states of hypo arousal and physiologically and emotionally, this looks very different. As I mentioned the red zone is like, more states of mobilization, blue zone is states of immobilisation and again that's based on Stephen Porges work where umm… he talks about how if our defenses fail us, our next defense system comes online are these states of immobilisation like the mouse who gets floppy and almost looks dead before it gets eaten by the cat or umm… the snake. So, in a hypo arousal the muscle emotionally it's much more like shut down, umm… depressed checked out and what happens physiologically is floppy muscle tone. So, we go almost into kind of this hopeless posturing, the muscles get floppy, heart rate actually slows way down, umm… and so this blue zone is umm… a place. Okay, so let me say this umm… in the red zone or the blue zone umm… if we go far enough into those zones or even outside those zones, umm… social engagement circuitry goes off, self-regulation goes off, learning circuitry goes off, judgment goes off, we just go into survival mode. So, we've got to fight, flight and freeze up in the red and in the blue, we've got freeze but it's more like possum playing dead or faint where we lose consciousness and obviously if we go too far even outside of red and blue into even more dramatic places, we actually go into altered states of consciousness like states of dissociation where trauma umm… kind of comes into the picture. What you see there on the slide is the word "threat" and the word threat in quotation marks because it's not just that when something threatening happens that we feel anxiety or reactivity or shutdowness. It's actually when our nervous system perceives threat, so that's why we've got threat in quotes. We may be going along fine in the Green Zone, but then there's something that causes our nervous system to go threat and when the threat is intense enough we go into the red zone or the blue zone. Oftentimes we will go into the red zone first and then if that fails us we drop down into the blue zone. But, kids who are anxious may go into red zone or they may go into shutdown blue zone or they may vacillate between the two. Umm… just as an example of perceived threat umm… I'm thinking about umm… a family that I worked with where the separation anxiety school was so intense that the child actually could not even attend, umm… school was actually a super safe environment, nothing was gonna happen physically or emotionally that was you know, going to be perilous in a life threatening way. But the child had… had… some really difficult experiences at school. Umm… Some of them were understandable and others we couldn't quite wrap our brain around. I was curious about the learning discrepancy, but also this was a child whose nervous system when it was time to go to school what threat… threat… threat… I can't do this, I'm not safe, I can't tolerate it. So, in this circumstance the kid wasn't being oppositional, he was adapting to something he couldn't do. He didn't have the capacity for. So, umm… this is so helpful to me because this helps us understand where we push and where we cush, dive that cushion. If the kid has a really… really… narrow green zone umm… and a little push can send them into the red zone, we need to be aware of that, whereas other kids umm… you know, we really… really… want to kind of push them a little and we know they can do it because they're gonna stay in the Green Zone, it might be the upper limits of the Green Zone and one sneeze away from the red zone, but they can still handle it. You know, I do a lot of umm… training umm… of teachers and parents and umm… now I actually work with a lot of umm… summer sleep away camp kinds of things and this last summer uh… with a colleague of mine, I was teaching this to camp counselors like, 19 and 20 year olds and explaining to them that they kind of have two jobs when they're taking care of kids. One is, to get kids back into the Green Zone when they're outside of it through connection and soothing and umm… providing safety umm… and of course we talked about strategies for how to do that and the second thing I said their job was is to expand their green zone and of course we talked about strategies for how to do that. That's all the resilience stuff that umm… that you probably have many resources on umm… but I think that this is so helpful because sometimes when a kid is avoiding something or getting really reactive or like seriously you're, that's upset like, why are you making such a big deal about it? But, if you really track nervous system arousal you go, "Oh, my gosh, it's a big deal to them like, look at their eyes, look at their muscle tone, their nervous system is saying this feels intolerable to me." So, either we have to reduce the stress of the environment or the demands they want or we have to expand that green zone and give them the skills or strategies to be able to do that. Umm… So the other thing that… that… can be really helpful to think about is that umm… when kids are really in the red zone or the green or the blue zone, they really can't learn umm… and they're learning circuitry kind of goes off and so one of the most important things we might need to do is to soothe them and get them back into the Green Zone which may be more of a Down river kind of thing before we can actually teach them the strategies and… and… kind of go up river figure out more what's going on and expand it. Alright, so let's go to number seven, umm… learning is impacted also this is what I was just talking about. Umm… Learning is impacted by nervous system arousal, so we can understand through this lens of really tracking this umm… at what point the anxiety or the… the… distress starts impairing their ability umm… to function socially, emotionally and behaviorally and then what to do about it. So umm… I think this can be really helpful is umm… to think about this especially as we ask the question, what kind of messages is this child getting from their caregivers about taking risks or doing something that's hard or doing something that's uncomfortable? One of the ways we can promote healthy risk taking and resilience in the face of something being difficult is to communicate number one, you, this is hard and to really acknowledge it instead of dismissing it or denying it or minimizing it and saying, you know, I don't know why you're so upset about this. This isn't that big of a deal. Why are you worried about this? And of course, I hear parents all the time saying things like, "You know, don't worry about it." And I've never once heard a kid say, "Oh, my gosh! That's so helpful thank you, I never thought of that." Like, that doesn't help, instead it's so much more helpful to say, "This feels really hard for you, this feels really uncomfortable for you." And umm… and to say, "You know what, it's okay, to feel uncomfortable. You can handle that, umm… I'm gonna to help you or let's come up with a strategy." But, the idea that giving the message of, "You can do hard things, right?" You can tolerate that. We don't run every time something feels uncomfortable and if you have a kid who plays sports you can use that as an… an… analogy. You know, the minute your coach tells you to run laps and you get tired, you don't just go, "This is tiring, I'm not doing this anymore." You know, you do it, you can do it. Umm… And then the other thing is to really do we give kids the message that they shouldn't try new things that just do well, just do right, umm… and don't take any chances, you know, umm… and those kinds of things. Umm… there's a umm… first grade teacher named Emily Brown that I have been honored to just learn so much from, she's a just gifted teacher and she's teaching her class about belly flops and high dives. And I loved this analogy so much. I told her I was gonna be sharing her umm… her analogy a lot umm… because it's the idea that taking risks sometimes and doing what we're uncomfortable doing and what's nerve provoking for us sometimes we can do it and sometimes even when we do it we're gonna have a belly flop. But, then we learn something and belly flops are part of life and that we are gonna fail sometimes and that's okay, we should be failing because it means we're taking chances and that's a great thing. It's again back to the narrative and the beliefs that were instilling. So, for me sometimes one of the most important interventions for kids with anxiety is to really look at the kinds of messages that they're getting from teachers and parents about taking risks about taking chances about tolerating discomfort and so that may be something to think about as well. Number eight, find strategies and effective responses that work for your body and brain. Now, I actually umm… teach the red zone, Green Zone, blue zone to kids, I teach it to parents and, I, we can talk about it, it's such a great language to use them because they can say, "Oh, I, my mom made me go to this thing and it made me go into the red zone or my teacher kept trying to make me, she kept telling me I had to participate in class and I told her I… I… didn't want to and she kept making me do it and so I just went into the blue zone and I just put my head down and I wouldn't respond the rest of the class period." Whatever, it gives them a language umm… and so one of the ways that so helpful as I can say now, you're saying you can't do this but it takes you into the red zone, but what could we do to have that experience just take you to here to this top part of the green zone, you're still in the Green Zone and it's gonna be a little uncomfortable and you're close to the red zone, but you can still handle it. What would that look like? What could you do that could make you feel like you could overcome this? Because since the brain makes these connections from experiences, if we can give them an experience where they master it, they can do it even if it was uncomfortable, but they pulled it off and we can really celebrate that, we're gonna start creating some new associations about how much they can tolerate and what produces anxiety that's intolerable versus just uncomfortable which we can handle. So, finding out co-solving with them, working with them and say, "What would work for your body and brain especially when we can't change the actual demands of the circumstances like, you have to have the surgery, you have to go to the dentist?" Okay? We can't just say, "Yeah, you don't have to go to the dentist ever again." They have to go, sometimes they have to do things that cause anxiety, so we can work with them and co-solve, "What would work for your body and brain? What if we put some music on in your ears? What kind of music would you want to listen to that would make you feel more green zone?" These are the kinds of conversations we can have. Umm… I uh… worked at a, uh… an amazing school in D.C. and one of the third grade classrooms, they had the kids make actual tool boxes, they were like little cardboard boxes that they decorated and it was their tool kit and they put all kinds of things into their tool kit that were things that help kids calm themselves down, make better choices remind them about who they want to be, different things like that. We can do that with kids, umm… we can create tool kits. So, what I'm saying here is that it might not mean changing what we're actually asking of the child. It might mean creating some tools and strategies. Umm… And it might mean creating new associations between something distressing and being able to handle it. And specifically even between a state of relaxation with something like this or taking some breaths and an experience that's a little bit stressful. Umm… I've actually gone with kids out to places where they have anxiety on the tennis courts, on the school campus, in the doctor's office waiting room and practice some of these things so that new associations become part of being in a physical space. So that's something you can do. Umm… Another thing we can think about is teaching them the… the idea of umm… becoming the experiencer and the observer. This is sort of umm… uh… a mindfulness kind of tool, but it's the idea that you're experiencing the anxiety, you feel it in your body. It's the right now for you. What does that feel like? Where do you feel in your body? In your, you experience that, but also let's not just experience it, let's observe it, let's look at it, so then we can say ha… that's really interesting. I'm noticing that my heart is beating really fast. So, it's not just the experience of, I'm so mad, and my heart's beating really fast, and I want to hit somebody. It's that and I'm noticing that my heart is beating really fast and I'm noticing that I feel really angry right now. Do you see how that gives them a different way of thinking about it in a different way of not just being victim to their internal world or the circumstances, but also being the observer of who can actually think and make choices around it. So that's something we can think about as well. Number nine, teach somebody based strategies to shift emotions and create new associations. Again, I'm taken back to the brilliant Pat Ogden, who talks about how the body both reflects and sustains our emotional life and our experiences and our thoughts and emotions and all of these things. And so, one of the ways I've had tremendous success is, I wish I had time to go into the science of it, but there's a lot of science that indicates that our emotions don't just start in our brain, but they start in our bodies and a lot of you might be interested in the studies umm… that are coming out about the gut brain in the heart brain and how umm… so much of our Serotonin and dopamine are actually in our gut and umm… that if we can move our bodies in different ways, we can actually shift our emotions. So, one of the ways we can think about this is a patient that I worked with, she was four at the time umm… and had the most severe case of separation anxiety I have ever seen. It was paralyzing to her for her mom to even go to the mailbox and I was able to make tremendous progress with her alongside with the… the… parents umm… practicing this with her in two or three sessions by teaching her, I said to her, and I'm gonna call her Katie just to make up a name. I would say, "Katie, show me what your body and face looks like when you're afraid when mom is leaving." And she you know, she would do it and I would say, "Now show me what your body and face looks like when you're brave." And when she did that the shoulders came back, the chin went up, her breathing changed and she would hold herself in a brave posture. And when she did that and was able to hold that, I would sustain it by being playful with her like, I would say, "Now, let's be brave sword fighters, or now let's be brave standing on my sofa umm… now let's be brave umm… you know colors or whatever." And I would have her hold it for three or four minutes and she could tolerate separation from her mom for long periods of time like 20, 30 minutes without distress whereas before just having mom walk out to the car to get her purse was extremely dis… dis… disabling for her. So umm… and then we talked about they said, "Well when your body is brave, you feel brave." And so we practice this and so before separation, she would do brave body before the separation and it was tremendous. So teach them things like that of using their body umm… when you walk and the experiment I might do is, I want you to talk really quickly, and breathe really quickly, and walk around the room like you're really anxious. I want you to just walk around like that and talk for a minute." And then I would have the… the… kid do that I would say, "How do you feel?" We would talk about how that really made them more anxious. And then, I'd have them sit like a floppy noodle and I would sit like that with them and we would talk slowly and breathe slowly and then we would talk about how that felt and how their body has the power to start shifting emotions. Number ten, teach more mind based strategies which allow them to overcome their anxiety and build skills that help them master these anxious emotions so that they can really thrive and do well in their world. Again keeping the laws of plasticity in mind, these strategies of the body and of the mind are gonna have to be practiced over and over and over before they umm… work. Umm… I'm thinking about Seligman's work and about learned optimism and how people who have optimistic umm… points of view umm… when they have setbacks they put it in context, umm… they say well, that didn't work because of this… this… time and here's how I can change it and they look to the future for how they can change things. They don't blame themselves too much, they see it as a learning opportunity whereas pessimists as you know see things as pervasive, umm… personal umm… and there's another 'p' but I can't think of it right now, I know all of you at home are saying it and I can't hear you. Umm… But, they see it as umm… lasting a long time that it's their fault and they can't bounce back from it and again this is where we go back to what beliefs and narratives are we teaching them around this growth mindset. Umm… Carol Dweck uses the word, "Yet" and I've actually been an amazing school umm… in Dallas where they have the word 'yet' written in huge letters in all of their classrooms. So, when kids say I can't do this it's too hard for me, we use the word "Yet," it's too hard for you right now. It's , you can't do this yet, but you will be able to and we teach them these mind strategies. One more thing I'll say about sort of a mind based strategy is the idea from the marshmallow experiment. I know you all know about the marshmallow experiment where these four year olds were told to wait until the researcher came back before they ate the marshmallow in front of them and if they did they were going to be given a second marshmallow. One of the things that a brilliant researcher did umm… was to umm… look to see that if they gave kids a strategy for managing their impulses are there motions if they would do better. And when you watch the, my marshmallow videos in these lab procedures the kids who don't eat the marshmallow, they have an intuitive strategy to kind of umm… reign themselves in so that they don't eat the marshmallow, they might cover up their eyes or turn their back to it or they might use motor activity or play some sort of game with the plate, they distract themselves. Umm… but kids who eat the marshmallow, it's like they're saying I don't have a strategy to manage, my impulses or my emotions here. So this brilliant researcher actually told the kids imagine that it's not a marshmallow, but it's a picture of a marshmallow with a frame around it and those kids waited 18 minutes longer to eat the marshmallow that gave them a tool or a strategy. Work with kids they often know what things help them, but they may not be applying them to the circumstances in which they feel the anxiety. So, I hope today that you have gotten some new language, a new lens that you can share with other people and some new tools that you can teach kids to really create new experiences over and over and over that don't just change their behavior or the way they feel or the way they think, but even the way their brains get wired to help them to use anxiety as a message to tell them something needs to shift that they can tolerate hard things and that they can make changes. And when we can do that with kids repeatedly, we're gonna change not only how they function in the world, but even how their brains are wired and that's a gift for generations and generations. I hope this has been helpful to you and of course you can umm… find me at Tinabryson.com where I have all kinds of articles and resources for you. Thanks so much and have a great day.
