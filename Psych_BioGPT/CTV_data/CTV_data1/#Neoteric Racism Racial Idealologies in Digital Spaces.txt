HECTOR Y. ADAMES Hello everyone. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Hi! 

00:03:45
HECTOR Y. ADAMES Buenos dias. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Buenos dias. 

00:03:50
HECTOR Y. ADAMES Excelente. Umm… before we began our presentation, we want to thank Dr. Miville umm… for inviting us to be… part of this fantastic conference that I've been coming as a student and I cannot honestly say today that dreams do come true, because I remember sitting here as a graduate student saying, "This is such a courtroom to present." And a few years later here I am, so thank you so much. 

00:04:15
NAYELI Y. CHAVEZ-DUENAS Good Morning, buenos dias. It's an honor to be here, thank you Dr. Miville for inviting us and as Dr. Adames said, it's a true honor to be presenting at this very place. I came to my first winter round table in 2001 as a graduate student and I fell in love with anti-racism work right here in this room. And it's just a dream come true to be here again. But now, not as a student umm after having learned English first time I came, I understood 50% of what was being said, but I understood the passion and I understood the necessity of this work. So being here today, 15 years later is an honor, I'm very happy to here. Thank you for coming. 

00:04:55
HECTOR Y. ADAMES Excellent, so as Dr. Miville said you could umm… follow us on our addresses here and perhaps unlike other presentations or other conferences, I'm actually going to encourage or actually that encourage you are to take up your phones and use your phones ideally to be talking about the conference and specifically talking about some of the work that we're going to be presenting today. So if you're all on your phone, I'm actually going to go to excited as opposed to thinking that you're bored and not paying attention. Okay, so please follow us and umm… the hash tag for the conference is WRT which stands for Winter Round Table and it is 2016 and the hash tag for this particular presentation specifically is #NeotericRacism which hopefully by the end of our 50 minutes together you're all leave knowing what Neoteric racism is all about? Sounds like a plan? 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Yes! 

00:05:50
HECTOR Y. ADAMES Excellent. So our goal today is umm… brief, because we only have a short 50 minutes. First we're going to start by… discussing how racism in race is expressed in different spaces. How it's been Express and particularly in the space of social media giving the focus of this conference. Then we're going to talk about how of race and racism has evolved through the different decades. Okay, so we're going to start back to back in to days probably for a time and then bring it up to 2016, here at TCS And lastly we're going to briefly present the results of a study uh… that, that we did that were in the middle of and talk about some implications about our work. Okay, and of course, you're all are more than welcome to engage and add to this agenda by you know, following along on Twitter. Okay, so social media, what is social media Okay. Umm… social media, who here uses social media just by curiosity? How refreshing that, almost everyone here uses social media, excellent. So as you know, social media is just a platform, it's a new space, it's a virtual space where we could connect, where we could share content, content, where we could dialogue, Okay, and that could be through text, that could be through videos that could be through photos. Again, there's different types of social media out there most of us including my mom and she's very proud of this. I thought I was going to say this, she knows how to use Facebook. So Facebook it's like the mainstream in, in social media for everybody and their mom is there. Okay, and then of course the, there's some other ones like Twitter, umm… again gives us a short amount of characters for us to talk about rarely 140 characters which is really hard for graduate students in academics. And of course then there is Instagram and my joke is that Instagram is for folks who don't like to write. So it's basically Twitter visual, a visual Twitter. So those top three tend to be the most common type of social Media that we have today and of course there are some other ones that are used for has by younger generation, perhaps a generation younger than all of us in the room. All right such as snapped… snap chat. So snap chat folks share content and it theoretically it disappears and you kind of never get it back in theory, but who knows right. Umm… then of course there's periscope. Umm… Dr. Travis and I actually think that periscope is the future. Umm… periscope is you're actually umm… live videoing wherever it is that you are. Anyone here is umm… periscoping currently? No, see that's why it's going to be the future. Everybody's always going to be live which is going to be interesting. And of course, there's Yik Yak, Yik Yak is your semi social media and you're sharing content and the content is within folks who are in your vicinity, literally around you. All right, so social media has really evolved since it started and again it's different ways for us to interact virtually in real time and to share images, videos, texts etc. So in these virtual spaces, there is all types of conversations that take place, including conversations around race and racism. Okay, what do folks do around these different themes and in particularly about race or racism? They start umm… talking about the news, the current events umm… any type of umm… jury decisions that have been made or being discussed here. Folks also express their personal uh… opinions about things, they share their personal experiences about whatever the content is. Okay, and it's basically a place where folks are really talking about what's happening in life and part of what's happening in life that we're all are swimming in is issues of isms. And in particularly our topic is gonna focus on race and racism. 

00:10:00
NAYELI Y. CHAVEZ-DUENAS So let's talk a little bit about racism. So we're talking of our social media and racism, but I want to give a brief walk through the different types of racism. So we all know we all familiar with the old fashion racism. Right? The racism that, that's out in the open, that is on your face some people call it racism one point all, or the Jim Crow racism. When people actually say, derogatory terms or in the Jim Crow era they will ask people to leave or they will separate people by races, prevent people from interacting with uh… caucasian or white people. That is a racism that we used to think was a thing of the past, right. That will make people really scare when they will encounter a situation where they will be calling umm… a bad name or derogatory name. Well, in modern times some researchers have argued that this type of old fashion racism now a days will only be expressed under three circumstances. One if we were around other people that think the same things we think. So one of the ideas is that when people there have their own prejudice or races beliefs come together then they will be more open to talking about those beliefs, because they will feel that you know, in company of people they have the same idea, so I'm not going to be judged. Two, when there is some degree of anonymity, right, so when people do not know what I'm thinking or who or who is saying something negative something raises, then I'm going to be more open to saying what I actually think or three and we have seen examples of this with uh… celebrities when under the influence of substances says that, with allow people, prevent people from actually making clear decision. So we've seen that in the past with umm… famous people that they have been drunk or have had other substances and all of a sudden they start to spew anti-Semitic, racist, uh… anti immigrant kinds of things. So that's the old fashion racism, now in, in modern times in contemporary society, there has been more talk about this modern type of racism or what they call racism 2.1 or 2.0, sorry, which is the racism that is more subtle that is more difficult to kind of name, but that people of color when we experiencing. We know something thing is happening, right? People make faces, uh… sometimes you're treated with less courtesy or less respect umm… and this is supposed to be that type of experiences that people have now in, uh… in modern times. It also involves I believe, this modern type of racism that believe that minorities already have made significant advancements and that there is no need to continue talking about race, because race is a thing of the past and racism is no longer something that is impacting the lives of people. Modern racism also includes four different components. The first one is this idea of reversed racism that many of you may have heard about or may have seen in reading in places like social media. This is a perception that people have that you know, we went through the civil rights movement, people advocated for the rights and that have led us into what time in a space where racism is over. People already have enough opportunities. And therefore if we believe that racism is no longer a thing is no longer a problem or an issue in society then any programs or any particular decisions that are made to help people of color living a more level playing feel then are perceived to be impacting negative a lot, negatively the lives of people in positions of power. So people we need how have this idea of reverse discrimination the reverse racism that this people are already doing well, people of color have opportunities. We don't need affirmative action for example, all right. In fact, when we look at recent studies, we see that when people are asked white Caucasian Americans in the United States are asked, "You know, how do you feel access to opportunities in modern times?" And what do they say? They say that they feel they are replacing people of color as the people that are most attacked based on race. I don't know if you have heard about some of those studies but they're coming out. there is a new study also where they look at anger and they published this in a in a famous magazine Esquire magazine where they asked people about frustrations in society and they actually found that the people that reported the most angry anger were white Americans. And why were they angry about what they reported being angry about the idea that the American dream doesn't seem any longer achievable. Interesting results, because people of color at the north and African Americans reported a significant reduction or compared to white Americans in terms of anger. So, what that tells us is there is something happening right now in society that is leading to this perception one that racism is a thing of the past and two that if you do something to protect or to equal the level playing field make the playing field level for people of color then that constitutes racism. The second component of modern racism is anti immigrant sentiment that I know many of us are familiar with. We just have to watch the political waves that are going on at the moment, there was a one last night and there was a lot of conversations about immigration. None of them positive, none of them focused on the strength and the contribution of immigrants to the United States. In fact, they focus on how do we stop more people from coming here, right, and we know that particular candidates are using this and that immigrant rhetoric to gain more support. We also think about the war on terror, so called Wall, war on terror and what does that look like? Who does it impact? And it's interesting to think about the fact that when an act of terrorism happens in the United States, the response buries by who actually committed the act. Right, so we think about the church where six people were killed I think it was in South Carolina right recently last year and what happened to the person who did engage in that mass murder? Well, their response was very different. There was no call for lets closer borders. Let's uh… ban people of Muslim descent, because this happened, because a person who actually engaged in this was not a person of Muslim descent. It was a white American. So we clearly see how many of these conversations are happening and then we think about the war on drugs and who does it impact. It doesn't impact the people that are using drugs on Wall Street, right? It impacts primarily people of color that are in that community. So you know what, all of this represents is that this idea of racism 2.0 is really having an Eric negative impact on people of color in particular, so when we think about old fashion racism, what I talked about the racism out open in your face and then we consider this idea about racism 2.0, the modern type of racism. Well, there is three things that have actually happened in recent times that have added to the complexity of understanding about what's happening in our country. The first thing is what Dr. Joe White calls the browning of America and we see, I see the browning of America say look at the audience. There is a lot of diversity in the United States and that diversity is growing and that's a positive thing, right? For many of us, but some people also don't perceive it as a positive thing, especially when people talk about the idea that by 2044, white people are going to be the numerical minority in the United States. That makes some people happy makes all other people really worried and scared. So we have seen that happen. Then we have also seen in 2008, something that nobody could have imagined. And that is the election of the first African American president of the United States. How did that change our conversation on race where people started talking about the polls racial era? Now, that we have a black president in the White House, we no longer need to talk about racism, because what happens, well, the biggest proof that racism has ended is that the American people have elected a black president. When we actually look at that data, we see that the people that elected Barack Obama. That majority of them were people of color in fact. Nevertheless his presence in the White House has created a lot of conversations about the need to continue to engage in programs and support programs that benefits communities of color. Around the same time, we saw something fascinating in that is the proliferation of social media. People started having conversations now one on one, not even just at conferences as we were doing at the winter roundtable, but they started engaging in conversations with people across states, across country lines and those conversations were happening in online in virtual spaces. So what we are proposing to you what we're asking you to think about is how can we understand how these things have contributed to racism and how would that this new type of racism actually look like? 

00:19:50

00:19:55
NAYELI Y. CHAVEZ-DUENAS Well, something that is important to understand is that when we're talking about discussions of race and specifically expressions of racism in social media, this is a new platform this is a new space in a new way to converse to dialogue, but also to express our beliefs and what we are calling this expression is neoteric racism, because we believe that old fashion racism and modern racism are not able to really explain what goes on in social spaces, especially social media spaces. So we're going to give you some examples of that. You see in this, in this post it was posted in Yik Yak that Dr. Adames talked about it. In Yik Yak people can post things within the same proximity about five miles radius and they're organized by a thread that they call Yak. So people can post anonymously what they think in what they believe. What's interesting about this is that social media has given us a window into what people are thinking and how people are feeling about different topics. Specifically, in this case we're talking about what people are thinking about race? How are people are expressing racist sentiments? That before for people of color we may hear from others but we may not actually get to see what people were saying unless they were saying it to us in our face. So we see this particular post how people are expressing in, in this post that clear definition of what we call old fashion racism, right? So, what Dr. Adames is going to do now is, he's going to connect from the different types of social media that he talked about. We're going to look at one in particular which is Twitter and talk about a study that we were trying to understand this idea of neoteric racism, racism being expressed now in a new space. 

00:21:55
HECTOR Y. ADAMES Thank you Dr Chavez. So, I'm wondering if anyone here is questioning or asking themselves, what is neoteric? Good, most of you are. So why did we use this particular construct to umm… put a label to racism in digital spaces? Well, we obsess over words, we work a lot into a lot of research together and then we argue and discuss passionately about what word we're gonna to put in our titles and this was one of them, right. So the reason why we both collectively decided to use neoteric is because neoteric means newly freshly produced. That's what neoteric means newly freshly produced. So what we're trying to understand is how is this form of racism is newly freshly produced constantly 24 hour, seven days a week, 365 days a year in this new space because of technology, hence neoteric. Okay, so to begin umm… we wanted to do an investigation in terms of, Okay, what we're saying, what we're, what we're, what we're noticing is it really out there? Right, so we started with a qualitative study, okay, 'cause you know new information starts after theory then you collect data with qualitative and then from there we go to correlation and we go up the ladder. So we're at the quality of stage in our, in our program. Umm… and we specifically chose Twitter and you get, I'm, I'm going to show why we chose Twitter compared to some of the other social media that I talked about in the beginning of the hour. Okay, in the event there's anyone here who's not fully familiar with Twitter, I'm going to give a quick tutorial. Okay, Twitter was actually introduced in 2006, and it was introduced right before the election of Barack Obama. so when Dr Chavez was talking about what was happening um… social historical in a context, this was at the same time we have a black man in a White House and social media happening at the, at the same time. Okay, another way to think of Twitter is as old fashion micro-blogging, excuse me. What makes it new in Twitter is that its micro and we have some parameters of 140 characters, even though some folks have become very creative are going around the 140 characters, okay. So basically, it's a tool used to design to have conversations with other folks, to umm… to share ideas, to build community, to build allegiance with each other, try a lot of from a social, social movements and social justice, advocacy happens in, in these spaces. Okay, it's a place where there is a lot of social dynamic conversations that are taking place and it's a forum again like I said to share all sorts of… of content. when we really looked at the data in terms of how many tweets are produced a day there is a lot. Okay, when we look at this through umm… in, in the in the few researches who's looking at this is 340 million tweets per day which is we don't need to do statistics to know that's a lot. Okay, okay, so who uses Twitter who is who are the individuals who are using this particular platform? Okay, so when we looked at this umm… we, we found that there's around 200 million users in worldwide. And out of the 200 million worldwide users of Twitter half of them approximately half of them are here in the United States. All right, so we know this is a powerful tool that's being used by many folks, but something that actually was interesting as we were putting our proposals and our projects together was that this is one of the platform, social media platforms that's used predominantly by people of color in the United States. And in fact, forty percent of youth of color use umm… Twitter and then the other one is Instagram. Okay, so because of this, we were very much interested in understanding race in this particular umm… digital space, okay. For those of us who are visuals, we also have a visual for you umm… and we get to see that when we look at the different social media platforms that are out there, umm… Twitter and Instagram are the ones predominantly used by people of color in the United States. Okay? Umm… one of part of our research lab, we have students who are presenting some pilot study on looking at issues of, of, of blackness umm… in black women and that's a poster, so I encourage you to, if you want to kind of understand the some, some research on Instagram to visit and support to student posters this afternoon. So anyways, we focused particularly on Twitter for these reasons. It's, it's heavily used, it's heavily used by people of color and the volume of tweets that are produced daily. So the purpose of our study real brief is basically just to explore and analyze how race, racism excuse me is expressed particularly in Twitter. Okay? Our… our question that drove our investigation was specifically how was content and race and racism expressed in microblogging, joined the specific historical events of police brutality. So given all the current events that are happening in our country unfortunately, we saw an increase in folks' dialoging around race in all social media platform. We particularly, because you know we have to operationalize everything, we particularly focused on into in 2014, after the verdict of, of the Michael Brown case. So we particularly were interested in, in looking at the kind of conversations that were taking place during this time. Okay? So what did we do? We… for 48 hours, umm… we were collecting umm… collecting data, umm… collecting the tweets that were being produced for 48 hours umm… following the, the verdict in 2014. Okay? Through our methodology every certain hours, we went in and I think of it as you're going fishing. So every hour you go in you cast the net you take a little bit out every hour so we did that for 48 hours and we actually collected 2089 tweets through that particular umm… sampling methodology. Okay, specifically in terms of in the event anyone wants to replicate this one, the way we went out fishing was that we use the hash tag umm… at Ferguson, because most of the we wanted to have folks who were particularly focusing around the Ferguson case in during this time. Okay? And out of the 2089, we randomly selected 101 tweets. Honestly, we only wanted 100, but somehow the next one just got in there, so we're being transparent and we kept it 101. Has nothing to do with Psychology 101. Okay? So… umm… in the event, anyone is interested in doing their dissertation, their thesis or any other work on Twitter or in the event anybody wants to replicate what we did, umm… you could certainly do this and uh… Dr. Chavez and I say social media is a great goldmine for research although it's very tedious and there's not a lot of standards for yet, for how, what's the best way to approach this from a method, from the methods perspective. But, one area that anyone wants to go in and get any tweet that's been tweeted from day one of Twitter to currently is if you go to this website Okay, gnip.com and in gnip.com you're able to access all historical data that's ever been tweeted on Twitter. Now there's a caveat and the caveat is its only tweets of accounts that are public not tweets of accounts that are private. Okay, so the sampling that we got were only folks who have their account publicly visible for everyone to see, something to know is that most Twitter users have their account public because that's the whole go of Twitter which is to engage in dialogue with other folks. All right, so we could do things such as content analysis, right? Do stats around frequency. Uh… we could do co-relational studies and, and, and umm… study that data in that way right through age and through location. Something else that we've done in another project is that, we've been able to map out where the tweets were taking place in the United States through Geo map. So that's another way to really make the data come alive and compare geography with other geography to see umm… where these conversations are taking place. Interestingly even though this is not part of the study, now that I just mentioned that, most of the racist tweets come from metropolitan city and not where we think of in the middle of nowhere in Kansas. Sorry, there's a human here from Kansas. All right, not in those stereotypical places that we may think of in rural America, it's actually right here in Manhattan which is interesting in, in many ways. Anyway, so when we or maybe not, umm… so, so what we found during this round was that we ended up with a number of domain, specifically we ended up with four domains through our analysis and those domains were racism, tweet stuff fall under the category of racism, tweets where, folks where umm… actually doing the opposite. Doing a lot of anti umm… racist dialogues and conversation and advocacy of course a lot of news coverage. And some tweets that we didn't know where to put them, so we put them in a, in a big US umm… pile. Okay? Well, we use uh… consensual qualitative methodology from Hill umm… modified and when umm… we did that we really found that there's none of them that was really, you know, we don't use significant in, in qualitative, but none of them really stood out. There was not one that was umm… predominating the conversation on Twitter. Okay, so equally everybody was taught, some folks were tweeting racist stuff and other folks were doing anti-racist stuff and that was kind of the that dance that is social justice and so I was taking place. Okay? And of course, in news media, umm… after this we did more rounds and our next round we wanted to see umm… more specifically into each category to see if there's any sub themes that were taking place within the categories that we first umm… surface, the first surface. And what we found with racism was that most racist tweets could be categorized into what we know from the literature into cultural racism and institutional racism. Okay, and out of these two the one that was the most umm… prevalent was cultural racism. Okay, and then of course we did capper to make sure that we're all metabolizing the same tweets the same way and that it's not by chance and umm… you know, pretty healthy cappers. Umm… for, for anti-race for anti-racist categories the sub umm… categories were instance… institutional justice and individual justice and something that, umm… that that was most prominent was institutional justice. So, most folks were really talking more about systemic ways of addressing racism on Twitter and not about one on one which in a way it kind of makes sense when we kind of think about it the platform and things like that? Okay, and in terms of news coverage my bias was that I thought that the media was going to have was going to be garbage for lack of a better adjective and actually, it was the opposite we actually found that the news coverage were most of them were not condemning. There were actually stories that were not condemning what was taking place in Ferguson during that time. Okay? So, so what right, so what this is all mean? So where we are is really trying to come up with a method that other folks could actually investigate the phenomenon in a very similar way and of course, our goal was to understand what Dr Chavez Nizar… Chavez and I are calling neoteric racism. This newly, freshly produced racism in, in digital spaces. So what we are in the process of looking at is really understanding this construct a little bit more and trying to see if there is a typology that could just sort of that could surface from the data. What we're noticing and what we're seeing and it's part of the implications of our research is that, they're, when we really looking more, at the, at the tweets that are more in the, in that first category, the racist category is that a lot of them are being umm… produce by… umm… by public figures. Okay, there's a lot of folks with systemic power with name and recognition including in academia, in the media, in sports, and politics. That folks are using that voice those tweets that content to support their own kind of way to… to justify their racist behavior in these in these umm… in these umm… social media spaces. All right! So, what we're seeing is that there's a growing hate there's growing anger when really looking fine tuning and looking more in that within the category of, of, of race, racist tweets. So what Dr Chavez and I are saying is that one of one domain with underneath the neoteric racism is this kind of callous neoteric racism. That is happening when we begin to peel the onion of that First domain. Okay? So these tweets of course, are expressing this new platform, there's evidence actually to this callous malicious trait, umm… there's a lot of insensitivity, a lot of, a lot of cruelty in terms of the language and the expression and the images that folks are posting. Okay, there's a huge lack of disregard umm… for the well being of other people and in particularly for folks of minorities groups. All right, and Dr. Chavez will provide us some of these examples that, that we're using to support this particular sub-domain of neoteric racism.

NAYELI Y. CHAVEZ-DUENAS So let's go back to the previous one. So, if you're thinking about how this is actually look like, this callous and emotional trades that many of us learn right in uh… in psychology. Look at the tweets, this are, these are some examples of different social media umm… applications and programs where you see what people are saying. So for example, if you look at this particular Tweet, you see what are people saying, "How is this been translated into social media?" So think about many of the conversations about immigration the have been happening in the last year in probably the last decade and there is not just you know, people say it's just about umm… allowing people that come to the United States with papers people that are here illegally many people say I'm not against immigration as long as it's legal. Well, hen you actually look at the conversations that people are having you see that is not just a rejection of immigration, but there is something particular the Hands of hate and a lack of compassion. So, this example for example, says you know you can shoot someone breaking into your home. Why are you not doing this at the border? So what does that mean? That means that somebody is comfortable enough putting this out there in a public space in thinking this is Okay. What's even more concerning when we're looking at this data is that is not just an individual posting something like this which is an isolated case, but in fact that when people make this kinds of remarks, there is all the people who come and they re-tweet, like, or share many of this posts. And so what does that mean about the country in which we are living? Many of you may be familiar with this one, this comes from umm… the platform called Yik Yak. This was actually post and, and this particular platform is, has another level of danger, because it's anonymous. So this came from the University of Missouri at Columbia. This happened after all of the unrest where students of color arguing about or talking to the administration about their rights not been respected, feeling that they were attending a school that was very hostile towards people of color. Well, soon after, all of that disappear in Yik Yak. Many people were talking about it, there were news coverage about it, but what is missing from the conversation is that, what does this mean for us? And in mental health, what does it mean for us as mental health professionals? When we have clients, when we have students that are living in this spaces where they're hearing their peers. When they're hearing people around them in Yik Yak, in close proximity making these kinds of remarks that are not just hateful, but that actually threaten the safety of umm… the individual and the group. And also this one as well and you can, in this, you can see not just the rejection of a group which we were talking about earlier in terms of racism, but you can see a particular flavor to this description that is not only hateful, it's umm… is hatred where at racial violence. And then this right across the river, right you know, the Kean University is in New Jersey. This was also posted on Twitter, interestingly enough the person the posted did it anonymously. So they didn't have their face, they didn't have the real name, but nevertheless this shows that people are comfortable saying these things and that, look at this, this person make this threat against black people and 52 other people thought, "Oh, let me share this with others. I want other people to see." Well, some of that may be you know some people wanting to see how hateful this was, but all the people typically in Twitter, you follow people that have similar believes that similar ideologies and you also see that all the people like some of these comments. Okay, so we were talking about police brutality, all right. And Dr. Adames walk you through the different ways that Twitter has used. Well, when people started talking about police brutality and the murder of black men by the police. In this particular case where Trayvon Martin, a young man, a youth umm… and many of us would think, "Well, people can connect at some level with pain of the family of having lost their child regardless of what happened." All right, well, when you go into social media and you see that types of conversations that people are having about this, you see people actually saying something like, "I thank god for the bullet that killed Trayvon Martin." So that, I think that gives us some pause to thinking what is going on in our country. And what can we call this kind of behavior that people are Okay saying this kinds of things and to congratulate somebody that had just Murder a child? So, we have talked about the, the bad, the ugly side of Social media, right? All of the hateful things that are shared, how they are shared? And I think at this point, many of us are thinking what do we do with this information? How do we use this information? And if we are social activists, if we're in academia if we're clinicians and we're considering or thinking about the world being of the people that we work with? We're also thinking about, how can we change the narrative? How can we take something that is so negative and so ugly to make it something positive? Well, that's, that's wasn't communities of color have done for years. That's what has allowed us to survive in a country that many times has rejected people like us. And so we wanna end with talking about how can we change the narrative? How can we say something that can be used for so bad? But, use it in positive ways and we know that this has already happened with social media where social media allows people to share information about what is happening right in the moment. So think about how do we know now, most people that live in the US and all that there is a problem with police brutality. They may not call it a problem, but they know that they have, different events have been occurring across the country. Well, how is it that people are finding that out? Well, in big part is because of social media. Because, as soon as something happens in, in my home state of Illinois in Chicago where I live, the next day after a black man named La Kwon McDonnell was shot by the police 16 times, it was all over Twitter and people were talking about it initially within the city the news spread very quickly, so the entire country knew what had happened and what this is that, it actually allowed people to connect, talk about what had happened, but also rally people to protest what have occured and specially the cover up that was taking place that it took over a year for the police to actually release the video of what had occurred. So people share news, they know very quickly what's going on. Right now there is a massive number of raids that are taking place, some that have happened in Chicago where umm… ICE, department of immigration and, and, and officials are coming to people's houses to detain them and deport them. Well, the community, the Latino community in Chicago has been very active at tweeting right away when something happens, this happened in this address. There may be a checkpoint in, in such street. So social media allows people to disseminate information very quickly before the media, the regular media does. It also allows people to organize, so another we know something is going on, what can we do about it? Well, think about, what happened in Ferguson? People rallied together, they started organizing, protests began to emerge and people came together to talk about, this is not okay, this is not acceptable. So, it allows for people to communicate, to organize and to begin connecting with each other so that no words can be established to change the system. We have some very good examples, we had the black lives matter movement, this is a moment that started in social media and it's started by people that were concerned about the level of police brutality that black men and women were facing. And it was all in their digital spaces, sharing information, talking about planning, what are we going to do? Organizing and creating events and information about umm… this events. We talk about the Dreamer's Movement. For those of you that may not know what the Dreamer's Movement is, is a movement that was created by youth. We have uh… an organizer here in the audience, hidden back there Jessica, she was one of the first people in Chicago that started to moblize all the undocumented students to come together, to talk about, these our challenges, these are the arrears that we face in our education, because of our legal status. And this took place where? In social media. Social media also allow youth in the dreamer movement to come together and find resources for one another, emotional resources to support each other, to decrease the level of isolation that they were facing, but also practical resources like, where can we apply? What universities are open to us? What kinds of scholarships can we get and where can we access that information? And then more recently we have seen very good examples of student activism including here at Columbia University, people protesting institutional racism and rejection of uh… people of color and different treatment of students of color and that has also taken place in social media. So while there is a lot of ugly, while there is a lot of hate that is been expressed in different social media umm… spaces, there is also a lot of hope and I think for those of you, with regardless of what you do in, in your lives, this is a, a platform, a way of thinking, how can I still change and what can I do? We have some very clear examples and fortunately, most of them come from our youth and we know that youth are the future. So, we, we need to start engaging with them in the mediums that appeal to them.

HECTOR Y. ADAMES So, as we try to cover a lot of territory in a short amount of time, umm… some of us may leave thinking or maybe feeling right now, how can we dismantle these social diseases? Right! And sometimes we get into a space that we may feel hopeless about it. Umm… and we want to and in a more hopeful, right, because that's what the winter roundtable is all about. It's about change, it's about systemic change, it's about you know, let's leave a better tomorrow for, for the next generation. And I'm going to use someone who's a personal hero of mine which is Sonia, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and she says, "You cannot value dreams according to the odds of their coming true. The real Value is in stirring within the well to aspire." So although, we may not see liberation in our lifetime that should not stop us from continuing to fight and leaving a better manyana(ph) at Social justice, gracias(ph)
