ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Hello, I'm Dr. Robert Schwartz and I'm very happy to talk to you today about Clinical, Ethical, and Controversial Considerations of DSM-5. I'm a professor in the School of Counseling, College of Health Professions at the University of Akron, and I have supervised, taught, and researched mental disorders over the past 20 years seeing an entire range of evolution of the diagnostic manual and it's unbelievable to me to see how not only has it become one of the hallmarks of our entire profession, but it's become more complex, it has become more controversial and there is been a lot of conflict that is created between mental health professions with different clinical philosophies. So, I'd like to discuss that with you today. But the first thing we have to acknowledge is that, it's an important manual to have no matter what mental health profession you are in, there are advantages to the DSM, and I think that we should acknowledge those. So, I would like to point out some of the advantages that I think are most important in the DSM, the correct version of course is DSM-5, this has evolved over the past 60 years through different versions of the DSM. And as time has moved on, as cultures have changed, as our professional understanding has evolved, so has the DSM in order to in the American psychiatric associations' where it keeps space with best practices in diagnosing mental disorders. So, for example, the DSM-5 does provide a structure that we could use regardless of what profession we're in. You know, if you think to a time before 1951 or technically 1952, when DSM-1 was first published, there was no standardized manual for clinicians to use to understand all their clients and to communicate about that. Mental health is a very, very soft science, it isn't like chemistry or physics or even physical health care, because there are no biological markers to any mental disorder, yet, even though that's been researched for decades, there is no reliable diagnostic marker for any kind of mental disorder outlined in the DSM. So, what diagnosis comes down to is an inter-subjective process between one human being who we call a clinician and another human being who we call a client. One who is suffering and one whose job it is a healthcare professional to understand them and help them recover from their primary concerns. Without something to guide us, we would really be floundering almost aimlessly and that was the case until DSM was first published in 1952, until 2013 when DSM-5 was published. Interestingly, most people don't know that DSM-1 and 2 were strictly related to psychoanalytic principles. Because at the time, in the late 1800s, early 1900s psychoanalysis was the dominant theoretical orientation. So DSM-1 and 2 until 1980, when DSM-3 was published, was based entirely on psychoanalytic principles. So, really there was no common language because what if you were a behavior analyst or what if you were a humanistic mental health professional or any other theoretical orientation, if you're using the DSM-1 or 2, you couldn't reliably communicate across professional boundaries, it was a hindrance. So, that's when DSM-3 first started to be a theoretical, not linked to one particular theoretical orientation. And the goal, one of which at least was to create this common language, so regardless of theoretical prospective and regardless of treatment setting, you could communicate across boundaries. So, whether you working at outpatient unit or residential facility or inpatient facility or state hospital, you have this language were everyone would have at least a very basic idea of what major depressive disorder was or what schizophrenia was, very helpful in many-many different ways. Also diagnosis although it does not directly relate to treatment because it's only a description of signs and symptoms that a person is suffering from, it can guide the treatment planning process. This is vital to understand in the counseling process, in order to be more efficient and more affective with your clients. So, after an assessment, diagnosis can help guide what the main interventions will focus on in order to help the person reach homeostasis or even human growth and development, beyond just symptoms of a mental disorder. The other thing that DSM does in a broad way is it helps give us some notion of how predictive a client's recovery will be. There are several 100 diagnosis in DSM-5 and some of them adjustment disorder for example are by definition short and mild in severity. So, you would know that the prognosis of adjustment disorder, if that's what your diagnosis was, would be very good. There are some diagnosis that have a fair too good prognosis or prediction of successful outcome like major depressive disorder. Then there are some that are what's called guarded. And that has to do with substance related disorders, its one example. Guarded is… is slightly worse prognosis than fair, it's cautionary that… majority of people may take a while to recover, but relapse is common, substance related disorders are one example of that. And then you have a guarded to poor prognosis in the more severe pervasive disorders like schizophrenia, in which only about 10% to 15% of client's fully recover. So, the diagnosis can give us a guide of what to expect in the future broadly speaking. And it is also could help us with what's called triage decision-making. Triage is a fancy word for making referral decisions to a certain level or type of care, outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, inpatient or even a state hospital. Generally speaking, the more severe and the more pervasive a mental disorder is, the more likely that someone will be triaged to a more intensive kind of mental health service. It really wouldn't make sense to triage a client with adjustment disorder to an inpatient unit long term. It may not make sense on the other side of the same coin to triage someone who just had a first episode of severe psychosis. And where he is actively hallucinating and had persecutory delusions, as a first treatment in outpatient counseling weekly. So, again, that's always tailored to very individualized care for a client, but it gives us a broad, broad stroke of how to think about the treatment process. And the DSM is one method to, "help us, increase our objectivity in the counseling process." Now I put it in quotes specifically because it's difficult to really justify the diagnosis as fully objective. As I said before this is really an inter-subjective process between two people, and it has everything to do with what lenses each of the two people are wearing. You might have a client come in and they have no insight whatsoever into the mental health concerns, couple of examples of that psychotic disorders, people with psychotic disorders because by nature, this is a disorder of reality testing, often are not aware that what they're experiencing is hallucinations or what they're thinking would be characterized by healthcare professional is delusional. So, it's very difficult for a client to be objective, but believe it or not, it's also difficult for the clinician to be objective. Because we all have our own personal history, don't we. We all have values, we all have biases, and the way that we view the world just like we do in life, is through our own history based on what we've learned. So, what's most difficult, in my opinion is differentiating what is deviant from what is maladaptive, as a mental health professional. What is deviant, technically means what is statistically different. It could be what you wear, could be how many hearing you have on, it could be the color of your hair, it could be anything, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it leads to problems in living, just because something is statistically different from the norm. Variety is the spice of life, isn't it? Maladaptive on the other hand means, external circumstances such as stressors combine with personal vulnerability, resulting in problems in living. And that's really the important point, is understanding, identifying diagnosing something when it's maladaptive, when it's causing problems in living for who? For the client, not for you has a clinician. Not based on your own childhood, not based on your own current relationships, but in the client's own life at this time what problems in living is a causing, if any. That's one way to be, "more objective" and the DSM has tried to do that by including criteria that specify certain types of maladaptive behavior. But, ultimately, because it's trying to capture what is maladaptive for literally every unique individual in America and in the few countries outside of America that might use DSM, it's impossible to do anything, but have very, very broad terms and descriptions, so it comes back to you as a clinician, ultimately determining. Is this maladaptive or not? And that's in the eye of the beholder, your eye. So, objectivity might be a theoretically valuable goal, but it's one that ultimately we probably can never achieve in a profession of life, like the mental health professions. The DSM also has done a lot to promote reputability of the field. And you notice on the graph here the symbol next to reputability is a bunch of coins, look likes gold coins to me, and that's actually true because the more reputable a field is or a profession within a field, the more valuable it is to clients, the more valuable it is to the business community to governments etcetera. And, you know, different professions had struggled with using or resisting the DSM over the past decades. One of those is the profession that I'm in, counseling. Starting in the 1970s when the first counseling law in Virginia was passed, the foundation of the counseling profession was built on human growth and development, wellness, holistic health, not just illness and focusing on symptoms of disordered thinking or a feeling or behaving. And so, toward the beginning of the evolution of counseling there was a lot of resistance to using DSM. I think this is also the case for other professions like couple and family therapy, because it the DSM uses a very individualized versus systematic kind of perspective on healthcare. But, over the decades as the American Psychiatric Association became more and more skilled in marketing in DSM and as mental disorders became more and more common language in the society, it was almost impossible for any mental health profession to resist using the DSM pointblank. It truly did almost become the bible of the entire mental health field. After all who would not have an idea of what depression is or ADHD or PTST or even bipolar disorder. These terms from the DSM have become so common place in our society that it's almost part and parcel of how we live nowadays. So, that makes it almost required for mental health professionals to use this as a guide in order to treat clients, definitely in order to get reimbursement from third payers and from many other reasons, for accountability etcetera. So, as time went on, all of the mental health professionals more and more depending on your perspective, changed their thinking about the value of DSM or just by and large gave in, even though it was in conflict with their professional philosophy. And it is… it is the standard of the entire mental health field at this point. With that standard came increased reputability for the less medical model mental health professions, like couple and family therapy, counseling, social work. So, today, I believe the counselors, for example, which are licensed in every state, in America can all diagnose and treat mental disorders, as long as they are independently licensed and in most places can you get reimbursed by third party payers. That wasn't the case even 10 years ago, let alone 20 or 30 years ago. So, part of it was being able to agree to use a system whether or not they fully agreed with the system itself. But elastic(ph) knowledge that they are just as many and some people might argue even more disadvantages then advantages to DSM. Some of these come down to an opinion, but most of them are widely held opinions across different mental health professions. For example this is a very, very complicated system, when you're talking about literally hundreds of disorders, often overlapping disorders, often using technical psychiatric language to describe the disorders. It takes a lot of training and a lot of expertise to do it effectively. And this takes a lot of time. I've been… as I mentioned teaching, supervising and researching mental disorders for 20 years and I would never claim for one moment that I was an expert in the DSM. Because it keeps changing over time, it evolves, we are on DSM-5, but also our perspectives of the disorders within one volume of the DSM changes overtime. And it's a never ending process. So, it's very difficult for people to ever get there and be fully effective, just as it's difficult to get there as a mental health professional treating a client right, in counseling interventions. One of the biggest risks of using DSM is using it is a cookbook. And unfortunately because of the pressures on us, diagnosing after a session or two, after meeting a brand new person who you've never met before, who is in distress, who is suffering, may have difficulty even explaining what their issues are and having a huge volume of 20 chapters of disorders with hundreds of individual disorders, combining those two processes and trying to come up with the diagnosis within a session or two, often leads people to just take the path of least resistance. Which is just opening up the DSM, checking off symptoms like a cookbook and throwing it all in the pot and then making a decision, sometimes even a half-hearted decision, risking miss diagnosis and possibly negligence. It's a dangerous proposition, but the cookbook scenario of using the DSM is often a… a fallback plan for people that unfortunately because of the pressures and the time constraints we have as clinicians, more and more nowadays, becomes the first strategy the clinicians use, not the most effective strategy, but often the first one. So, be careful about that and also be careful about taking enough time to make sure that when you are making a diagnosis that it's accurate and you are really confident about that diagnosis is. One of the limitations of the DSM is that out of all of these hundreds of disorders listed in there, there is amazing amounts of overlap in symptoms, I mean, it's hard to even describe, you know. For example, just pulling one out of a hat panic disorder. Panic disorder includes unexpected recurrent panic attacks, among several other criteria. But, did you know that another anxiety disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder or trauma related disorder, like, PTSD or acute stress disorder can have panic attacks. So, an example of overlapping symptomatology or signs and symptoms, is that any anxiety or trauma or obsessive compulsive disorder, can include these panic like symptoms and it's very, very difficult to pinpoint whether it's panic disorder or some of these other things. Depression can include anxiety, uh… substance related disorders can lead to any other disorder in the DSM, hallucinogens can mimic psychotic disorders. Stimulants can mimic anxiety disorders; depressions like alcohol can mimic depressive disorders on and on and on and on. Really seeing the whole picture and doing an effective job of piecing this out is very, very, very hard, for anyone under the best of circumstances. And I think that's one of the reasons, that reliability of diagnosis is actually only fair to poor. What we are talking about here is inter-radar reliability or inter-radar agreement. So, what that means is, the consensus among more than one clinician, that a diagnosis has a certain name and code. Actually recent research has showed, that the reliability of DSM-5 disorders ranges from about 0.2 to 0.5. Some of the most reliable diagnosis between clinicians still have more than a 50% error rate or incongruence. Now, that could be because people are just aren't trained or experienced enough, that could lead to lack of innovative liability, but it could also be because of the types of disorders, how they're described. Because of all the overlapping complex signs and symptoms, it's confusing for people. The end result is in general people really aren't a 100% sure, let alone not show that they agree with others. So that affects the common language that we're speaking which was one of the benefits of DSM. Another risk which is becoming unfortunately more and more common I've seen this first hand is the risk of abuse, what do we mean by that, dollar signs. Diagnosing for dollars. Unfortunately, nowadays whether it's Medicaid, Medicare private insurance companies, it's almost required in all circumstances to have a mental disorder diagnosis in order to receive reimbursement for services. And what that means is that, you must diagnose someone with an illness in order to help them improve their life. What that means is that we are working in an illness care system more than a health care system. Think about that for a minute. If you're working in an illness care system in order to get paid, or for CEOs or presidents of mental health agencies to pay salaries, keep the lights on etcetera make their board of directors happy, you will have pressure to diagnose some mental disorder on every single client that walks in the door. And I have heard that from countless clinicians, they don't want to have to diagnose every person walking in the door with a illness. But, they feel pressure from their supervisors, from their third party payers, from the entire system to do that and so they just have to find something. Imagine if you went to a physician, just for an annual checkup and he wasn't or she wasn't going to get paid for that, unless they diagnosed you with a severe illness and they had to just find something. Well, I… I'll just say strap throat, I mean, I… I… I know you are not here for anything like that, but I got to do something, you know. That would be a pretty unethical, what in… or… or illegal. Well, actually, a lot of these abuses that are happening today by over diagnosing what's called up coding. There's a word for that and it's called fraud. And unfortunately there's a risk of that happening in the kind of system that we have and focusing only on illnesses as the thing that must be identified. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, please be mind full of that and do right by your clients and your profession in the broader society and don't diagnose for dollars. People often don't realize that the DSM is politically motivated in some ways. What do I mean by that? Well, it's published by the American Psychiatric Association, a prominent, well organized, very beneficial organization for the country. Research wise, healthcare wise, but it's definitely an organization with a certain prospective because it's made up of psychiatrists. And the DSM being published by the APA is designed by a small group of people who are psychiatrists, and it's a private manual that's simply created by one organization and approved by one board of directors, the APA board of directors. Now, do they consult with other mental health professionals and even internationally, yes. But ultimately they make the decisions and they come from a certain perspective and the DSM is a very, very, very, very profitable publication. DSM-5 for example cost about $25 million to make, which seems like a lot of money. They just about made that money back the first year of publication in 2013 and the first half of 2014. It's estimated that the DSM makes about $5 million a year continually throughout the entire history going back decades. Now that money goes to American Psychiatric Association and what is it used for? I don't know, but it is not used to promote counseling or social work or couple and family therapy or other professions. Umm… It's goes to promote psychiatric treatment of mental disorders and much of psychiatric treatment relates to psychotropic medications and that the APA and psychiatrists are well linked to pharmaceutical companies which are private for profit companies by enlarge, and so it ends up being that the DSM system and it's organizations and it's… its counterpart organizations are big business, they're big business. And I want to be very clear that I am in no way saying that that's wrong because that's part of our capitalistic system. But you should be aware that there is a certain perspective and that can be politically motivated. Now I'll tell you one story very quickly and this is not something that I personally have witnessed, but this was told to me directly by someone who worked on the DSM-4 task force to design criteria for DSM-4, the last version of DSM. He was, He is a psychologist. And he was in the workgroup working on, up certain group of mental disorders. And in that workgroup, the rest of the group were psychiatrists. And they were working on one disorder called physical condition affected by psychological factors and they were saying to everyone in this closed group that they wanted to take that out of the DSM-4 because this is a new area in psychology called health psychology and basically they were going to… health psychologists were going to take their bread and butter. So, they wanted to remove it and he has stood up in front of the group of psychiatrists and said you may have forgotten that I'm a psychologist and I will expose the reasoning behind this and they ended up after protest from him leaving it in, but relegating it to page 700 and something of the DSM-4, check it out yourself. So, there is a lot of politics and compromise involved in this. It's… It's a human created thing. It promotes a medical model with treatment which focuses just on illness and care and that unfortunately can lead to a lot of stigma for our clients. And it's just simply hard. There are so many choices to be made, it's just difficult. That's where ethics comes in. Now, out of all the mental health organizations the only one that I'm aware of that has specific ethical codes related to diagnosis is the American Counseling Association Code of Ethics, section-E. They have several ethical codes that hallmark the need t be very conscious of this in order to be accurate and not miss diagnose. And the first one has to do with the assessment process, making sure to do that very well, very patiently, very efficiently and then they also focus on cultural sensitivity. We talked about this a bit when we discussed the fact that this is very inter-subjective. Anything in the DSM, whether it's the name of a disorder or the criteria or the look and feel of the manual, has to do with a certain culture at a certain point in time and that's why it changes over the decades. Something that I find very important and fascinating is something that I've researched myself and that has to do with ACA ethical code E.5.c., which talks about the fact that's certain individuals and groups have been victims of pathologizing through diagnosis of mental disorders. Now there is a long, long history over decades for example, of certain racial groups being over diagnosed with certain mental disorders and most prominently psychotic disorders. That African-Americans have historically been diagnosed at a much higher rate with psychotic disorders than Euro-American or Caucasian clients. And there are other disorders as well. But all of those research studies, were done by psychologists or psychiatrists, non-counseling related mental health professionals. Two studies that I published in 2009 with a first one's focusing on counselors as a diagnosticians, people that had multi-cultural counseling training who knew these ethical codes to see if the same pattern held and guess what, it did. African-Americans were diagnosed much more significantly at a higher rate with psychotic disorders and childhood disorders like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Whereas Euro-American or Caucasian clients were diagnosed more often with mood disorders or anxiety disorders, things that you might argue might be less pathologizing. Lots of research shows this and so again this has to do with learning and culture potentially bias in the diagnostic process and at best it shows us that we have to step outside of the process and again try to be a subjective as possible with what is maladaptive for the client and their life at this time, not from our own lense, because it's rife with misinterpretation that way and then stigma, social, harm and many other aspects. Finally, because diagnosis can lead to so much stigma and so much, you know, added disability to a person's personal life and work life and school life, it's a very sensitive thing, the American Counseling Association highlights that you can refrain from making a diagnosis if you wish to. Sounds easy, sounds great, doesn't it? Much harder to do and practice because of the system that we work in, but it's a very good point that all of us should keep in mind, every single client that we assess, how will this negatively impact their life when a medical condition called a mental disorder is on their record. Do you tell a client that your making a mental disorder diagnosis and do you tell them what it is? Most clinician do not. I bet if they did, if they felt obligated to tell the client what their diagnosis was, they may be feel more obligated to follow this ethical code as well. Rather than diagnosing in order to follow a system and get reimbursed, etcetera, etcetera, behind the scenes, which is generally what happens in the majority of cases. So, ultimately we must ask ourselves, how do you make efficient and effective diagnostic decisions by taking into account all of the things that we talked about today. The benefits and the limitations of DSM the ethical principles that would bound to follow to protect the welfare of our clients, and the client themselves, the person who are suffering the human being behind the diagnosis, who are ultimately obligated to work for. How do we do that and do a good job working in this mental health/illness system that we must confront every day, well in my opinion all of these things are the factors that we should take into account, we should be holistic looking at the entire person, the big picture, understanding them from their perspective. We should look at from a developmental standpoint, whatever their presenting concerns are, how is it affecting them now, how is it changed over time from the past etcetera. We should be very, very culturally sensitive, we have to understand the problems in living that this might cause for them in their life at this time and using their language. It's their perspective that… that matters here. And using empathy, using a truly person centered approach, and last but not least in order to hold all of us accountable as clinicians doing it in an evidence based way. What does that mean? Documenting everything that you do and your rational for it. If you think somebody has a mental disorder you should be able to document why? If you think it's a specific mental disorder with a certain code and name, you should be able to document which signs and symptoms the client reports and that you observe. You should be able to document the severity and the pervasiveness of their distress, and the impairments that it's causing in their life, so there is a record of all aspects of what lead you to that decision. If you do that, and you use words from the client, from their report, and you step outside and try to be objective about it and you are empathic and supportive through the process, so you take these three things into account. You have a very, very good chance of being an effective and efficient diagnostician. And the rest of the treatment process flows from there. Do any of you have questions that you like to follow up on? 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN I have one. How do you deal with the pressure to diagnose a client that doesn't necessarily meet criteria to be diagnosed? 

00:41:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Excellent question, because we know that that happens all the time, because of various pressures in the current system. And unfortunately, that pressure is there, but the key is that we have to act responsibly for the benefit of our clients. The Hippocratic Oath says, "To do no harm." When we diagnose someone with a mental disorder that doesn't fully meet criteria for a mental disorder in general and that's specific diagnosis, we risk stigmatizing them, we risk causing harm to their family, to their jobs, to themselves in terms of self-stigma. We must give options instead of doing that. So what are the options? Well, one is a sliding scale fee, if it's related to third-party reimbursement. Many places, agencies or even private practitioners might offer a sliding scale to give more flexibility so their clients can afford treatment without a mental disorder diagnosis. Another way to do it is through pro bono work. Offering services to those in high need without charging them as a service to the community. Another option would be referral to a system that doesn't need to diagnose mental disorders because they don't receive third-party reimbursements like a training clinic at a university, for example. And lastly, another option is that some agencies or organizations get grants, to serve a certain kind of client population. And then they don't have to submit those records to third parties, they are already getting funding to do a certain service and they could provide that on their own. So I would recommend that clinicians look for those four different kinds of resources in their, uh, in their immediate area, so you could make referrals when needed, or adjust your own system or payment scale when needed. So you don't feel forced to diagnose a mental disorder that you can't justify because the truth is your name and your license is on that line every time that you diagnose a medical condition. Are there any other questions? 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN I have one. Umm… what is the philosophy of counseling? And how does it fit or not fit with the DSM? 

00:43:40
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Excellent question, because the counseling profession has evolved over 40 years and it does not follow a Medical Motto Philosophy. Medical Motto Philosophy is one that is more of the western kind of approach to healthcare, that is very positivistic, meaning that you focus on what the cause is and how to eliminate that cause. It's a very cause effect, kind of, relationship. So, for example, similar to physical healthcare, you try and identify what the illness is, and cure that illness. The goal is not health though, necessarily, the goal is not development, the goal is not growth, and it's certainly not unfortunately helping empower someone to become their own counselor, for prevention in the future. So Medical Motto Care, generally speaking, is tertiary care, it's when there is already an illness and an expert comes in to treat or eliminate the illness. The counseling profession has been founded on wellness, growth and development, prevention, before someone becomes ill to the point that it's causing major disability in their life. Now of course, counselors can treat mental disorders as anyone else can in another professions. But the philosophy of treatment might be very different. We would view a client more holistically, from a bio, psycho, social, spiritual perspective, and we would help a client become empowered to recover as much on their own as possible. And that ultimately could help them in the future, prevent illness on their own. Any final questions? 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I have one. Umm… you mentioned the difference between deviant or atypical and maladaptive. How good of a job do you think the DSM has done over time of not labeling things as diagnoses that are really just atypical or deviant? 

00:46:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Difficult question that to answer umm… because it depends on what the disorder is, and it depends on which, you know, DSM edition we're talking about, but I do think that over time, the American Psychiatric Association has been more sensitive to the difference between deviants or difference in people, and what is maladaptive or, or harmful in people's lives. So one example of that, in the DSM-5, the prior version, DSM-4 had a mental disorder called gender identity disorder. And it was a very controversial name of a disorder because over time people who are transgender became more accepted in society, more understood, it became, uh, more available to, uh, live according to who they were and to be accepted that way. And the term "disorder," for someone who was struggling with issues, related to gender identity was very stigmatizing, and it was very advocated… strongly advocated against. Well, in the DSM-5, they did change the name of that disorder to gender dysphoria. And they dropped the word disorder from that, because they realized, well, it might be deviant statistically different from the norm, but it's not necessarily something that's an illness. But it's a partial solution because ultimately, the diagnosis code for gender dysphoria is an "F" code in the chapter of mental disorders and it is still characterized as a mental illness. So it's a half way step, and I think that there have been many partial steps in the right direction. But there is a long way to go. So one way that the DSM-5 has helped us get more towards that goal is something called the cultural formulation, which if you look in DSM-5 on page 749, they list an entire section on specific questions to ask clients, to understand their culture, their background, so you don't misdiagnose something as a disorder when it's just simply different from you or even from the cultural norm. A step in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go. And that's why it's a very important for all of us as mental health professionals to advocate for cultural sensitivity, for following ethical codes, and for making sure that we put the client first, not the business of mental health.
