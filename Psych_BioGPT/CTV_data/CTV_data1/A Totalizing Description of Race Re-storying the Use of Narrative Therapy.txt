A Totalizing Description of Race: Re-storying through the use of Narrative Therapy with Loraine Hedtke, Ph.D. And John Winslade, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
LORAINNE HEDKE What we're going to be um, demonstrating next is a conversation that is about totalizing description. 

00:00:40
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:00:40
LORAINNE HEDKE Uh, and I know that that term, 'totalizing description,' is, might be a little bit jargony for people who are not familiar with narrative practices. 

00:00:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:00:50
LORAINNE HEDKE Um, so for um, eh, to help put things in context could you just define and explain what totalizing description is? 

00:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Before just defining it, let me just say that one of the assumptions of narrative practice is that the words that people use have an effect in people's lives. 

00:01:10
LORAINNE HEDKE Okay. 

00:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE That they're not simply um, you know, it's, we have that expression, 'Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.' 

00:01:15
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. 

00:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Words do hurt people. 

00:01:20
LORAINNE HEDKE Yes. 

00:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE Um, and in particular some kinds of expressions have more, do more damage than others. And total, totalizing descriptions are the ones which actually some people are in a word or two and um, often put people in a box um, and describe them as if everything about them fits this one description as sort of captures the essence of a person and says, 'That's who you are.' And when that is said by someone who has power and authority it can have dramatic effects in people's lives. The kind of situation when someone says to uh, a teacher says to a kid in a school for example, 'You're no good at math.' 

00:01:55
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. 

00:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE Um, 'You'll never be any good at it.' And kids give up at that point, just from that kind of comment. So totalizing descriptions can be extremely powerful um, and they are even more powerful when the person has certain kinds of authority behind the saying of those things. Um, you know someone can say something like, 'You're always mad,' or, 'You're always late.' Or something like that, that's totalizing. But when someone says, in my professional authority I call you something like you know, a disease or a syndrome or a diagnostic category, um, it has a powerful effect that doesn't just describe something that already exists, it actually creates something. And creates often very negative effects. 

00:02:40
LORAINNE HEDKE So . . . 

00:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE But it's the, that's what I mean by totalizing description. 

00:02:45
LORAINNE HEDKE So can you tell me then what gets left out of that? 

00:02:45
JOHN WINSLADE Well put it this way, if you call someone a criminal, you're saying this person is criminal in their essence. In who they are. 

00:03:00
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. 

00:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE In their identity and that summarizes them, but if you think about it, even people who do lots of criminal acts are not doing criminal things all the time . . . 

00:03:05
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. 

00:03:05
JOHN WINSLADE . . . so you know, probably 80-90% of the time, they're doing nothing criminal at all. And all of that stuff gets left out of the description of who they are, and therefore gets left out of how people respond to them and how they think of themselves as well. So, so totalizing leaves a lot of stuff out. 

00:03:25
LORAINNE HEDKE So does it impact on how we view that person, or how that person views themselves? Is that what you're saying? 

00:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, I think it has dramatic effects. The way we totalize people leaves out the complexity in people, and invites them to see themselves in oversimplified ways, and to leave out some of the, the possibilities of being something else. Being something different. 

00:03:45
LORAINNE HEDKE Do you have a sense about um, those descriptions in um, the psychological discourse about um, what stor-, stories or what description, descriptions get um, told um, more often than not, do you think? 

00:04:00
JOHN WINSLADE When I think psychological discourse um, needs to examine itself. Um, because I think um, you know, the summarizing of people as um, uh, you know as some kind of disorder, whether it's um, ADHD or um, bipolar or um, borderline personality. You know all of those things may have currency in the sense that they describe some aspect of people, but they never describe all of a person. And when we use them un-, in an uncomplicated way, the problem is that we can do damage. Um, those descriptions were all invented with the aim of helping people, but they're often do less help then they, they open up possibilities for less help and they open up for damage. And that's the problem with them. 

00:04:50
LORAINNE HEDKE And, and just one last thing that I'm, that I'm curious about, is how narrative practice differs from that. 

00:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE Well the aim of narrative practice is to retain a sense of the complexity of people. The sense that nobody is one thing. We all have multiple stories that are available to us, we can all be more than anything, description that we um, make. That is made of us. Um, and therefore the aim of narrative practice is to often to bring out the counter story, and to allow that a chance to see the light of day. A chance to be, um, built upon, a chance to actually have meaning preformed around it, and identity to be formed around something other than um, so for examp-, other than the totalizing description. So for example, someone who is called ADHD in narrative practice we would be always willing, and, we will always, um, wanting to ask something like, um, 'Who are you besides that?' 

00:05:50
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. 

00:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE And not to actually um, treat the problem story of somebody as the total sum of who they are. 

00:05:55
LORAINNE HEDKE So you're always looking for, listening for the exceptions? 

00:06:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and people's resistant to it because um, often people have totalizing descriptions given to them, but they work hard to get around them. 

00:06:10
LORAINNE HEDKE Sure. 

00:06:10
JOHN WINSLADE They work hard to overcome them. 

00:06:10
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. 

00:06:10
JOHN WINSLADE And that is often a noble effort that I don't want to treat as being, being in denial, I want to treat it as something, in a, a desire and an opening to something else and to something different. And I want to sort of celebrate that pe-, with people in, encourage the explanation of the something different. 

00:06:25
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. 

00:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE And often that can actually be overcome, um the effects, not always okay, 'cause sometimes some total things that have um, just, um referred to in totalizing descriptions can't be eliminated out of people's lives. But they can actu-, can at least be complicated. And that can, celebrating complexity is part of the narrative practices that I want to encourage. So what we're going to see now is an interview which is actually um, illustrating the practice of complicating a totalizing description. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Hi Juanita. 

00:07:00
JUANITA Hi. 

00:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you for being willing to join in this filming exercise. Um, and um, I want to, um, before we start, before we get into the conversation to make sure you feel okay to um, um, direct me away from anything that you'd rather not talk about in front of the camera and in front of other people. 

00:07:25
JUANITA Yes, that'd be fine. 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay? 

00:07:25
JUANITA That's fine. 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE So um, what this conversation is about is not a whole counseling conversation in itself or a relationship in itself, but a part of it. And what we're trying to do here is to make some video tapes as practice exercises to show people how to develop narrative counseling skills. 

00:07:45
JUANITA Okay. 

00:07:45
JOHN WINSLADE And so what I would like to invite you to, to talk about is what we call a totalizing identity description. 

00:08:00
JUANITA Okay. 

00:08:00
JOHN WINSLADE That is the kind of thing that sometimes people say to other people, sometimes people in positions of authority and power, and sometimes um, just amongst peers that has an effect on them, and, and it kind of tells them, kind of summarizes who they are and what kind of person they are. So um, I'm um, interested in hearing um, what it is that you've thought of that kind of fits that, that category. That kind of experience where you were given some kind of, um, description of yourself. Is there something you can think of right there? 

00:08:30
JUANITA Uh, yeah. Um, probably the most, the one that sticks with me throughout is um, my appearance and then my complexion. 

00:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:08:45
JUANITA So it seems like, I guess dark skin people are supposed to naturally have big noses and big lips and um, things like that. And so um, I'll have people say things like, 'Oh, you're pretty to be so dark.' You know, and it's kind of like, well what does that mean. You know as a dark skin person supposed to be ugly, and then I beat the odds? Or what does that mean? 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right. 

00:09:05
JUANITA And so . . . 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE So it's kind of like giving you something with one hand and taking it back with the other almost. 

00:09:10
JUANITA Right. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE And, and is that being like, when is that being said to you? 

00:09:20
JUANITA It's actually said quite often. 

00:09:20
JOHN WINSLADE Quite often. 

00:09:20
JUANITA Right, and I don't think people know what they're saying, but um, me being on the receiving end of it, it's kind of like you're saying that I have a disease . . . 

00:09:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:09:30
JUANITA . . . and I'm beating the odds of the disease. 

00:09:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:09:35
JUANITA And the disease being um, my dark complexion, and then beating the odds by the fact that I'm not um, this ugly because of it. 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Right. 

00:09:45
JUANITA If you get . . . 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE So it's uh, it a description that has in the background some assumptions about skin color and about race and those kinds of things. Is that right? 

00:09:55
JUANITA Right. 

00:09:55
JOHN WINSLADE Um, and it's one that people say kind of almost as you described it, almost offhandedly without intending to be um, directly hurtful of you. 

00:10:10
JUANITA Right. 

00:10:10
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:10:10
JUANITA Yeah, because people say it as a compliment. 

00:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and they think they're . . . 

00:10:15
JUANITA And so . . . 

00:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE . . . giving you a compliment? 

00:10:15
JUANITA Right. And then, but its when you say, 'Oh you're pretty to be so dark skinned.' It's kind of like should I be saying thank you, or what does that mean? 

00:10:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:10:30
JUANITA And to me it means that a dark, dark, being dark skin automatically means ugly. 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:10:35
JUANITA You know what I'm saying? So . . . 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE So it's the unspoken description of you . . . 

00:10:40
JUANITA Right. 

00:10:40
JOHN WINSLADE It's the spoken part which is you're pretty, and then the unspoken part is the color of, the implication of ugly. 

00:10:50
JUANITA Right. 

00:10:50
JOHN WINSLADE Of dark being equal as ugly almost. 

00:10:55
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:10:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:10:55
JUANITA Yes. 

00:10:55
JOHN WINSLADE So do, can you give me an example of kind of, I mean you've told me that this has happened a number of times, but I'm wondering if I can understand it more fully by if you could tell me an . . . 

00:11:05
JUANITA Oh. 

00:11:05
JOHN WINSLADE example of when this is kind of affected you or come at you and . . . 

00:11:10
JUANITA Um. 

00:11:10
JOHN WINSLADE . . . as something that was given to you. 

00:11:10
JUANITA Well a real simple situation was um, a friend abou-, a friend of mine a really close friend of mine um, we used to talk on the party line when we were younger. 

00:11:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:11:20
JUANITA And um, she was . . . 

00:11:25
JOHN WINSLADE I remember party lines. 

00:11:25
JUANITA Yes. And she would say, um, the guys would ask like, 'Oh what do you look like?' And she said, well I'm light skin with green eyes, and they'd be like, 'Oh wow, okay, yeah, you're good to go.' And then they would say, 'What do you look like?' And I would say, 'Well I'm dark skinned.' And they would go, 'Oh well how dark? Are you dark, dark, dark? Or are you just a little bit dark?' And, 'Are you dark like foxy brown or Rudy from the Cosby show, or are you dark like. . .' You know and it was like . . . 

00:11:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:11:50
JUANITA . . . why do I have to go through all this, you know, expla-, explaining of how dark I am and she says she was light skin and green eyes and you're done with her. She's perfect, and then now, when I'm describing myself I have to go through, like a whole description of what now, 'How long is your hair?' You know, this and that, and it's like once you've said you're dark skinned you've automatically put yourself in this group where you're saying that um, I don't, I don't have any hair, or I can't grow hair, basically. 

00:12:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:12:20
JUANITA And um, and now I'm basically ugly. So now it's kind of like, 'Well okay if you're dark skinned then how dark are you?' Then you say, 'Well, I'm really dark skinned,' okay well then, 'you know, you're not really wanna try to meet you, but we still want to talk to. . .' 

00:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:12:40
JUANITA And the thing about it was um, once we would actually go out to meet the guys they'd be like, 'Oh.' 

00:12:45
JOHN WINSLADE Oh. 

00:12:45
JUANITA Yeah, like, 'Oh okay, you're cool.' And then it would be like, you know, are serious? Like you thought you could . . . 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE There was something in (inaudible ) that you thought you could . . . 

00:12:58
JUANITA Yeah. 

00:12:58
JOHN WINSLADE . . . you could really read . . . 

00:13:00
JUANITA Yeah. 

00:13:00
JOHN WINSLADE . . . a surprise or something like . . . 

00:13:00
JUANITA Right. 

00:13:00
JOHN WINSLADE you weren't fitting what they had built up in their minds? 

00:13:05
JUANITA Exactly. So it was kind of like, so it's always kind of been um, uh, I don't know, it just seems like even when I enter a room, or something like that um, my complexion is um, what I feel that people see first. 

00:13:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:13:25
JUANITA And then I constantly have to um, build around it to get people to see other things . . . 

00:13:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:13:30
JUANITA . . . besides, because I think for me, dark skin automatically means like, you're dumb, you're loud, you're you know, you don't have very much to offer . . . 

00:13:40
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:13:40
JUANITA . . . and then you have to continuously prove outside of what comes along with being dark skinned. And, and I, and I believed that this is actually placed on me from within my own race. 

00:13:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:13:50
JUANITA Not necessarily from other races. 'Cause I don't, I don't think I get um, talked about from other races as badly as I do from within my own race. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you're aware of the distinctions that are made, like amongst African American people along these issues of darkness and lightness or complexion? 

00:14:15
JUANITA Right. 

00:14:15
JOHN WINSLADE Um, as you think about that though, is there not in the background other kind of assumptions that, that are being played out in African American talk that come actually from um, the sort of history of racism and, and colonization and all of that kind of stuff? Is that somewhere there too? 

00:14:40
JUANITA It, you know I've thought about it, because I try to think like, 'Okay well is this something that maybe my mom put on me. . .' 

00:14:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:14:45
JUANITA '. . . as a kid?' Um, and I think that's just how the world is, because . . . 

00:14:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:14:50
JUANITA . . . that's how my family thought, 'You know, we're dark skinned.' You know, even in my family we have the, the um, I don't want to say like the color codes, but if you're lighter skinned you're treated better and you kind of separate yourself from the darker skinned part of the family. 

00:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:15:10
JUANITA And um, so . . . 

00:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE So there is a kind of code as you said? 

00:15:15
JUANITA Right, like there's . . . 

00:15:15
JOHN WINSLADE A code you kind of puts people, evaluates people in certain ways? 

00:15:15
JUANITA Right there's like levels kind of. 

00:15:20
JOHN WINSLADE There's levels? 

00:15:20
JUANITA Yeah and so um, but then when you go out into the real world and it plays out, then you look at it as a lesson that your family shouldn't have taught you, because you go out in the world, and all you need is that one situation to actually play out, like your mother or your aunt or whatever told you . . . 

00:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:15:45
JUANITA . . . was I guess like your problem to begin with. 

00:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:15:45
JUANITA And then when you see someone else who has nothing to do with your family say something about that, then you kind of think like, 'Oh well, here it is here . . .' 

00:15:55
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:15:55
JUANITA . . . it's just how the world functions.' 

00:15:55
JOHN WINSLADE So there's, there's kind of lessons that you're saying that you've learned, and I'll come back to that in a minute. Like what, what you've kind of figured out from this, what, what I'm hearing is that there's a situation that happens and it doesn't only happen occasionally, it's happened quite a few times . . . 

00:16:15
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:16:15
JOHN WINSLADE . . . where you kind of put into a group. And not just seeing as Juanita with what you bring to the world . . . 

00:16:25
JUANITA Right. Mm-hm. 

00:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE . . . but you're kind of put into a group and then people are surprised when they don't see you quite as fitting . . . 

00:16:30
JUANITA Exactly. 

00:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE . . . as the kind of group place that you're given and the group level, and the old evaluations that go with that. 

00:16:35
JUANITA Right. 

00:16:35
JOHN WINSLADE And I want to ask before I come back to how you kind of um, struggle to be who you want to be in respinse to any of that, I want to ask about the affects of that. What affect has it had on you? The use of this kind of . . . 

00:16:55
JUANITA Um. 

00:16:55
JOHN WINSLADE . . . coding, grouping, slotting you into a box, totalizing you? Those kinds of things. What affect has it had on you over the years? 

00:17:05
JUANITA Well um, it's, it's had quite a bit of um, negative affect, but then I think because of my personality um, I've turned the negative into positive. 

00:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. So there's some of both, right? 

00:17:20
JUANITA Right. 

00:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE And not, and not to . . . 

00:17:20
JUANITA But it's like the constant fight . . . 

00:17:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:17:25
JUANITA Like I said f-, the affect on me, and I always compare it to having a disease. 

00:17:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:17:30
JUANITA Like the disease, it's almost like the doctor's saying, you're paralyzed and you'll never walk again. 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:17:35
JUANITA But I'm walking. 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, yeah. 

00:17:35
JUANITA It's like that. And so um . . . 

00:17:40
JOHN WINSLADE So I'm interested in both of those, what the, the negative effect is, and also how you've turned it into something more positive for yourself. 

00:17:45
JUANITA So, and I, and, and I have to say that even that I'm dark skinned the fact that, um, the negative thing would be that I don't appreciate my skin tone as much as I probably should . . . 

00:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:18:05
JUANITA It makes me not as appreciate myself. 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:18:10
JUANITA As much. But . . . 

00:18:10
JOHN WINSLADE So like interferes in your relationship with yourself. 

00:18:15
JUANITA Right. But then it helps that, and I hate to say this, but it does help that I don't look like what is expected of a dark skinned person. It helps that my actual real hair is down to here. 

00:18:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:18:25
JUANITA It helps that I don't have this large nose across my whole face. 

00:18:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:18:30
JUANITA It does help that my lips are not huge, because I'm not fitting in the category that um, people are placing me in, so it's kind of, so it is like being paralyzed and walking and because I'm walking I'm going to go the extra step . . . 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:18:45
JUANITA . . . to run. And that's how . . . 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE It, it's curious the way you said, 'I hate to say this.' Now what do you hate to say? 

00:18:50
JUANITA Because um, because I shouldn't feel like that about myself. But I do. 

00:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is it almost like you join with this whole um . . . 

00:19:00
JUANITA I do. 

00:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE . . . process of calling people these things and slotting them into these groups, even in your own thinking. You can't somehow stop it from affecting how you think about yourself (inaudible ) 

00:19:13
JUANITA Right. 

00:19:13
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:19:15
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:19:15
JOHN WINSLADE In that sense it also interferes with your sense of yourself and your relationship with yourself. 

00:19:20
JUANITA Right. 

00:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE That has you thinking things in which, in another part of you you would say, 'No I shouldn't do that.' 

00:19:25
JUANITA Mm-hm. Like some days I can look in the mirror and I don't know what it is, but some days I just think I am too dark. And so, um, um, I'll try to do things, not to necessarily lighten my skin, but to um, just to uh, I don't know, like I don't know. I guess I'll try to do things to make myself feel better. 

00:19:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:19:50
JUANITA But um. 

00:19:50
JOHN WINSLADE But at that moment you need to somehow fight against what it's doing to you. 

00:19:55
JUANITA Right. And so like I'll do, I've done things like dye my hair, um, brown, but my hair really can't take the dye so . . . 

00:20:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:20:00
JUANITA um, just to lighten up my face or I'll use Andy which kind of like makes it's a cream that makes your complexion clearer. I'll just, I'll do different things and I, I know that it's because um, not that I don't appreciate, well, I, not that I don't appreciate who I am, and I don't want to be anyone else . . . 

00:20:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:20:25
JUANITA . . . but um, at times I do, I do feel like I know that people are looking at my complexion . . . 

00:20:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:20:35
JUANITA . . . and because of my complexion they think negative things. And so um, sometimes I just don't want that. 

00:20:40
JOHN WINSLADE And you can't help but know that. 

00:20:40
JUANITA Right. And sometimes I just don't want that. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:20:45
JUANITA And so um, I try to do things um, to present myself as, as . . . 

00:20:50
JOHN WINSLADE As anything different from that almost? 

00:20:55
JUANITA Right. 

00:20:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

00:20:55
JUANITA To get people to recognize something else. 

00:20:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Yes. 

00:20:55
JUANITA You know about me besides um, the color of my skin. 

00:21:00
JOHN WINSLADE And you don't want people to know you that way because it's sort of like uh, um, it slots you into something that doesn't allow you to be . . . 

00:21:10
JUANITA I just don't want to . . . 

00:21:15
JOHN WINSLADE . . . who you want to be. 

00:21:15
JUANITA I just don't want to be a part of anything that anyone notices. If you're going to notice something about me, then notice something completely outside of my complexion. You don't have to compliment me on it, or you don't have to say anything negative about it. 

00:21:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:21:25
JUANITA Just don't even notice it, because it's not, and it is a part of me, but it's not even something that I want you to focus on. Because you don't even know . . . 

00:21:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, you don't want that to be the central focus all the time anyways. 

00:21:35
JUANITA Right. And it's kind of like having a disease. 

00:21:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:21:40
JUANITA Don't even focus on it, you don't know much about the disease, you don't know what it is that I go through with the disease. You don't know how I got the disease. You don't know anything about the disease. 

00:21:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:21:45
JUANITA So the fact that I'm walking, and I was supposed to be paralyzed. That's what I want you to focus on. 

00:21:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:21:50
JUANITA Don't focus on I was supposed to be paralyzed and I'm not. 

00:21:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:21:55
JUANITA And it's like, that's like my skin complexion. I'm supposed to be dark skin and ugly and this and that. But apparently I'm not, so let's not focus on it. 

00:22:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:22:00
JUANITA Let's get past it. 

00:22:05
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:22:05
JUANITA And so. 

00:22:05
JOHN WINSLADE So, I mean you gave me quite a poignant and powerful description of that moment when you looked in the mirror and you um, have those uh, conscious of those negative descriptions sort of intruding and even on how you think about yourself sometimes. Right? And, and I'm wondering how you answer that thought? 

00:22:30
JUANITA Um . . . 

00:22:35
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, do you have a response that you give when that thought starts to intrude? 

00:22:40
JUANITA Well I get past it. 

00:22:40
JOHN WINSLADE You get past it. 

00:22:40
JUANITA Yeah. 

00:22:40
JOHN WINSLADE How do you get past it? 

00:22:45
JUANITA Um, well I, I'm able to you know dress myself in bright colors, and um, you know . . . 

00:22:55
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:22:55
JUANITA . . . put on different things. You know, just really dressing myself up and taking time with um, the clothes that I select in different things like that. 

00:23:00
JOHN WINSLADE So this is a conscious intention that you have there? 

00:23:05
JUANITA Right. And then you know keeping my hair done and just doing things outside of to bring attention to other things. So that takes my focus off of it, because now I'm focused completely on other things besides, you know this is, I mean there was days when I would never wear a black sweater . . . 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:23:20
JUANITA . . . just because I would feel like I wouldn't be seen or something like that . . . 

00:23:25
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:23:25
JUANITA I mean I just, as funny as, or as maybe stupid as it sounds, I don't wear black shirts. 

00:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:23:30
JUANITA You'll rarely catch me in a black shirt. I may have out of the 100 or 200 shirts that I have at home, I may have one or two black shirts. 

00:23:40
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:23:40
JUANITA So that's just things that um, that I'm, I'm aware of. 

00:23:45
JOHN WINSLADE So what you're describing, it sounds to me like um, a range of ways in which you seek to make, in terms of appearance, seem to make yourself noticeable for other things. 

00:24:00
JUANITA Right. 

00:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Are there other ways besides in relation to appearance that you also make yourself, you put yourself into the world and say, 'This is who I am and this is who I want to be?' What I want to be noticed for? 

00:24:10
JUANITA Well I just, I think I try harder at a lot of things. 

00:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

00:24:15
JUANITA Uh-huh. Because um, I want to, like you said, I want to be noticed for those things. I don't want to be um, thought of as stupid because I'm dark skinned or . . . 

00:24:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:24:30
JUANITA . . . um, you know whatever so I try a lot harder at things. Um . . . 

00:24:35
JOHN WINSLADE To not be as stupid you mean? Is that right? 

00:24:35
JUANITA Right. To not, to, to move the stereotype . . . 

00:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:24:40
JUANITA . . . of dark skinned people being . . . 

00:24:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Yes. 

00:24:40
JUANITA . . . stupid. To, to move it to something else. Not necessarily as a whole, but just for me. 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:24:50
JUANITA If I can . . . 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE You can't take on the whole of the stereotype, but you can do it for yourself a little bit. 

00:24:50
JUANITA But at least if I can, you know, make people see that um, all dark skinned people aren't stupid or whatever, and I try harder um, at expressing myself and I try harder at you know, making sure that people are completely comfortable around me, by being myself. 

00:25:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:25:10
JUANITA I don't like to talk about other people, I don't like to do negative things around other people, whatever, because I don't want the same negativity to come back to me. 

00:25:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you, you, are you saying that you consciously work against that stereotype . . . 

00:25:25
JUANITA Everyday. 

00:25:30
JOHN WINSLADE . . . in . . . 

00:25:30
JUANITA Every second. 

00:25:30
JOHN WINSLADE . . . like in relation to other people who have dark skin for example? 

00:25:30
JUANITA Not necessarily that, but everyone . . . 

00:25:35
JOHN WINSLADE But everyone. 

00:25:35
JUANITA . . . because I believe that everyone thinks like that. 

00:25:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:25:35
JUANITA And so um, so I have to be as, not necessarily as friendly and I don't do it consciously anymore . . . 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:25:45
JUANITA . . . that's just who I am . . . 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:25:45
JUANITA . . . now. So I try to be as friendly, as welcoming as I can to other people. 

00:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE And you try hard, as you said, to try harder than other people might . . . 

00:25:55
JUANITA Right. 

00:25:55
JOHN WINSLADE . . . for example. 

00:25:55
JUANITA Right. Because I . . . 

00:25:55
JOHN WINSLADE Do you ever explicitly have to speak about this at times? 

00:26:00
JUANITA Um, yeah. 

00:26:05
JOHN WINSLADE To whom? 

00:26:05
JUANITA Well it kind of came up when people were bashing Michael Jackson for coloring his skin. 

00:26:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:26:10
JUANITA And I was telling um, some friends that I understood that. 

00:26:15
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:26:15
JUANITA I understood people constantly talking about your skin to the point where you just want it to go away. 

00:26:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:26:20
JUANITA And I'm sure in the area that he grew up in it was even more prominent for people to think that about dark skin people. 

00:26:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:26:25
JUANITA And then for him to just say you know what I want this skin to disappear . . . 

00:26:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:26:30
JUANITA . . . and people just to see me as Michael Jackson. And even though he did, when he did that, now you know people wanted to bash him for that, but I understood it. 

00:26:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:26:40
JUANITA I totally understood it. 

00:26:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:26:40
JUANITA And I believe that I probably was living in that area, I probably would have been using some kind of bleaching cream too. Because it gets to the point it gets really heavy on a person to have to deal with . . . 

00:26:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:26:50
JUANITA . . . that so, so yeah, there is um, times where . . . 

00:26:50
JOHN WINSLADE So you felt a connection and a compassion for what Michael . . . 

00:26:55
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:26:55
JOHN WINSLADE . . . Jackson was going through. Right? 

00:26:55
JUANITA Oh yeah. And then there's times where I have um, lighter skin friends and we get that. We understand the difference. They go through things that I don't go through because of their lighter skin. They automatic . . . 

00:27:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:27:10
JUANITA . . . people in the black race automatically think that if you're light skinned you think you're better . . . 

00:27:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:27:15
JUANITA . . . than a black, then a regular black person. 

00:27:15
JOHN WINSLADE So it gets really . . . 

00:27:15
JUANITA Yeah. It gets . . . 

00:27:20
JOHN WINSLADE . . . complicated and tangled there right? 

00:27:20
JUANITA Oh yeah. Yeah. And it's, you know and you would just like for it to disappear, and . . . 

00:27:25
JOHN WINSLADE It doesn't just disappear. 

00:27:25
JUANITA Right. 

00:27:25
JOHN WINSLADE But you are conscious of you deliberately working against it? 

00:27:30
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:27:30
JOHN WINSLADE And we're going to bring this to a close in a minute, but I'm wondering if there are any other ways in which you work against it. This whole thing. 

00:27:40
JUANITA Um, you know I think it's just basically just, you know, reeducating myself . . . 

00:27:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:27:50
JUANITA Um, doing well at my job, um, just things like that. Just constantly trying to move up in, in working in a way that it just brings a whole new focus to me. . . 

00:28:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:28:05
JUANITA . . . so no one can say, 'Oh well she's just that little black dumb girl that we knew she was going to be anyway, because she was dark skinned and that's that.' 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
JUANITA You know so it is just a constant um, strive like I just have to constantly find ways to be recognized for other things outside of my complexion. And then at the same time to get people to say, 'Oh well maybe all dark skinned people aren't so, aren't dumb or don't have good looks and the note and you know.' And, and, and I don't know, it just gets, it gets pretty crazy because even though you know you're put in this box, um my mom's a genealogist, so I know my heritage . . . 

00:28:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:28:45
JUANITA . . . so when it comes down to it I'm not just, you know, some black girl who has no um, culture or no, you know, no connections to any other um, areas besides whatever it is that I want, that people want to label me, but . . . 

00:29:00
JOHN WINSLADE So does that mean that you saw to you that genealogical story about who you are? 

00:29:05
JUANITA It is. It is, because it gives me um, a place outside of just being black. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE Just sort of about the kind of . . . 

00:29:15
JUANITA You know. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE . . . immediate appearance being important. 

00:29:15
JUANITA Right. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE It kind of put importance is attached to something else which has to do with, you know, people that you come from. 

00:29:25
JUANITA Exactly. Exactly. And you see them as beautiful people and because they're in their different countries and island they are, they can appreciate the dark skin and the different um, the different features and things like that, and not see them as just one whole, oh you're black and you're done . . . 

00:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:29:40
JUANITA . . . you know. Um, so . . . 

00:29:40
JOHN WINSLADE And you have children right? 

00:29:45
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:29:45
JOHN WINSLADE Is that, is that something you share with them and communicate with them? 

00:29:50
JUANITA Well actually it played out in my children. 

00:29:50
JOHN WINSLADE Did it? 

00:29:50
JUANITA When I first started the program it came out in a counseling session and I didn't even realize that I was doing that because I have one um, dark skinned child and I have one light skinned child. 

00:30:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:30:00
JUANITA And I automatically um, made sure that my dark skinned child had very nice clothes, ve-, just I mean I went through so much with just trying to make sure that she knew that she was beautiful . . . 

00:30:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:30:15
JUANITA . . . and that was because um, she came home when she was in preschool and told me that someone called her ugly and black. And um, when she did that um, it had brought things for me from the past up and that moment I felt like um, I had to give her a way to fight back . . . 

00:30:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:30:35
JUANITA . . . against her dark skin. And so I had got so focused on her that I forgot about my other child and I didn't think that she was going to have any problems . . . 

00:30:45
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:30:45
JUANITA . . . and she did actually and it kind of got um, and I didn't and I just always thought that she was going to be fine. You know, you'll never have these problems with your complexion, um thank you. But um, she did end up having different problems, and I had to realize that actually my dark skinned daughter didn't have any problems. She does know that she's beautiful and she doesn't get to talk a lot at school, and I was fighting against something that she hasn't even been going through herself. 

00:31:20
JOHN WINSLADE What I'm hearing is this whole story about the difference between people with dark or light skin causes divisions even within a family. 

00:31:30
JUANITA Exactly. 

00:31:30
JOHN WINSLADE And divides children even against each other if it's if you're not careful you have to stop that from happening. 

00:31:35
JUANITA Exactly. 

00:31:35
JOHN WINSLADE And that's, that's what you saw happening with your own children and you're quite just disturbed to see how powerful this whole thing was. 

00:31:40
JUANITA Mm-hm. And my reaction to it. And then I realized that it was my problem not her problem. She didn't know that black and ugly went together. 

00:31:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:31:50
JUANITA When she was at school and I'm sure that the preschool child that said it . . . 

00:31:55
JOHN WINSLADE She wasn't conscious of that. 

00:31:55
JUANITA Right. 

00:31:55
JOHN WINSLADE But she was experiencing the effects of it, right? 

00:32:00
JUANITA Right. And I, and I said, you know your dark skin you're going to be called ugly, and I didn't tell her this, but I just felt like this was automatically going to be some of the things that are going to happen to you . . . 

00:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:32:10
JUANITA . . . because this is what I went through. 

00:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:32:10
JUANITA So let me give you a way to fight back. The things that . . . 

00:32:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:32:15
JUANITA I didn't have to fight back. 

00:32:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:32:15
JUANITA You're going to be very well dressed, your hair is going to always be nicely done. You're going just your face is going to always be very clean, you're going to have new shoes all the time . . . 

00:32:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:32:25
JUANITA . . . just things like that. 

00:32:25
JOHN WINSLADE Uh-huh. 

00:32:25
JUANITA And I had gotten so caught up into that part of things and giving her um, you know, telling her that you're beautiful, you know things like that, I don't care what nobody says, you know things, things like that and um not realizing that she wasn't even going through any of that. She had a regular day in preschool and so what somebody called you black and ugly you're going to be called names period, and I shouldn't have taken it as far as I did, but my initial reaction was to go that far and not until I sat with someone and talked . . . 

00:33:00
JOHN WINSLADE But you want to protect your daughter from those things. 

00:33:00
JUANITA Right. Mm-hm. So . . . 

00:33:00
JOHN WINSLADE And the effects of powerful stories that have long histories and . . . 

00:33:10
JUANITA Excatly. 

00:33:10
JOHN WINSLADE . . . have produced divisions between people. Even people who are experiencing the effects of put into groups um, by this whole thing, this whole stereotype . . . 

00:33:20
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:33:20
JOHN WINSLADE . . . and, and what I'm hearing is um, you know, a number of the ways in which you have sought to um, resist the effects of that both for yourself and now for your children. 

00:33:35
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:33:35
JOHN WINSLADE And um, I have to say that is, it moves me considerably to hear this. I feel a sense of outrage myself in what is done um, around this issue. So and I want to put that into our conversation as well. 

00:33:50
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:33:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay with you to say that? 

00:33:55
JUANITA No that's fine. You're fine. 

00:34:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, we're going to pause and bring this to a close for now. Um, but I want to thank you for sharing what is both um, a very personal thing, but also something that my guess is will resonate through many people who have been through or are experiencing some of the things. 

00:34:20
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

00:34:20
JOHN WINSLADE So thank you for your time. 

00:34:20
JUANITA Thank you. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:25
The Reflecting Team 

00:34:35
JOHN WINSLADE Here's what I'd like to do is just thank each one of you for um, being willing to participate in this, um, reflecting team or outside witness conversation that, that we're going to have. Um, I know we just watched a conversation that Juanita had with John previously where she described a totalizing description in her life. And what I'd like to do with the few of you, with Michelle, with Angel, and with Evelyn, for you to um, kind of talk with me about some of your reactions to it. And I might ask you a few kind of specific questions to a-, about that. Would that be okay? Um, and just initially my thought is um, to start we just like to ask you know what your um, what kinds of images you were struck with, what places uh, resonate with you. What um, terms um connected with you in what you just heard when you were listening to the conversation with Juanita and John. And what about for Angel or Evelyn are there different things that struck a cord with you in listening to the conversation with Juanita? 

00:35:50
EVELYN I think for me um, when she aid my skin tone, my skin color is the first thing people see when I you know walk into a room that's the first thing I think people notice about me, and that just, that resonated with me, because it seems like that's super frustrating to go through life and having to think that this is the first thing that people notice about you and you kind of have to adapt to that conform to what you think people think about you. But that, that just really resonated with me. 'Cause you don't want that to be the first thing people notice about you, because there's so much more outside of that. 

00:36:30
LORAINNE HEDKE There's so much more? 

00:36:30
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:36:30
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so same thing Evelyn, um are there places where um, for you that, that that particular resonance um, make sense or speaks to you personally about um, your life experience or um, a stick for you um, if it put for importance? 

00:36:55
EVELYN Uh definitely um, kind of on a different path, but like I feel the same way a lot of times when it's regard to my weight. I think that that's the first thing that people notice about me when I walk into a room, and I have to kind of look around and say, 'Okay, where am I going to sit? How are people going to respond to me. Things that's why that resonated with me because that's not all of who I am, it's who I am, but it's not all of who I am. So that's where that struck a cord. 

00:37:20
LORAINNE HEDKE Mm-hm. Sure. So places where being limited to a physical description. 

00:37:30
EVELYN Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:37:30
LORAINNE HEDKE And in those limits um, uh, noticing that people might be missing out on other things? 

00:37:35
EVELYN Yes. 

00:37:35
LORAINNE HEDKE About who you are or perhaps what Evel-, what Juanita was saying about who she is. 

00:37:40
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:37:40
LORAINNE HEDKE Is that right? 

00:37:45
EVELYN Yes. That is, but she also said that um, something along the lines of like someone asked her, 'Are you. . .' She said I'm dark. And they were like, 'Well how dark.' And I've had those same questions being asked like are you, I'll say, 'Well I'm a big girl,' and they will say, 'Well how big?' Are you big, big or like super big like, like I really . . . 

00:38:05
LORAINNE HEDKE Oh. 

00:38:05
EVELYN I related to her with that. 

00:38:10
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. Almost similar con-, conversation that uh, it's in kind of terms that Juanita was using. 

00:38:15
EVELYN Yes. 

00:38:15
LORAINNE HEDKE That people are interested in the physical description. 

00:38:20
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:38:20
LORAINNE HEDKE Yeah. Yeah. Um, what do you think that um, people then miss out on? Um, when they go with that narrow definition of skin color or um, um, physical build? 

00:38:35
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:38:35
LORAINNE HEDKE What is it that you um, want them to know that is in addition to that you think? 

00:38:40
EVELYN Just aside from my physical appearance, which I adapt it as who I am, but um, just like my intelligence, my sense of humor, my personality in general, and I can, I can see that that's something that Juanita seemed to want as well. Like don't look at this part look at everything else, because that's a lot, that's worth a lot more. 

00:39:05
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. 

00:39:05
EVELYN Sort of the parts where I would want people to look. 

00:39:10
LORAINNE HEDKE So places were, were pretty uh, impactful. 

00:39:15
EVELYN Yes. Yeah. 

00:39:20
LORAINNE HEDKE Okay. (inaudible ) come back to that or (inaudible ) conversation with that. Um, thank you for um, sharing intimately to start things off it's (inaudible ) yeah. 

00:39:29
EVELYN Oh not a problem. 

00:39:30
LORAINNE HEDKE What about you angel, um, as you were listening to the conversation with Juanita, what kinds of things stood out for you? 

00:39:35
ANGEL Um, one of the, the poignant things that she said, or maybe John said was that um, the color code uh, within a family or just um, in general uh, being uh, Hispanic decent um, it, just in my family alone, uh, there's very lights shades of us, and there are very darker, you know, shades of us. Um, some of us have blonde hair blue eyes, and then there's those of my uncles that have really tight kinky hair, brown skin, um, and there sisters, like I said, blonde hair, blue eyes. And they've had conversations, I've heard them you know have conversations before where they're teasing each other about you know your kinky hair, or you don't have to worry about sunscreen because you're not going to burn. You know, just taking little jabs at each other. You know they're brothers and sisters, um, so when she said that that's one of the things that, that um touched home with me was that even just in our Puerto Rican family it's an issue uh, I think that's powerful when she said the whole color code thing that even, I can relate that she feels that as being a black woman and what, how she described it as her disease. Uh, but I think there's even other races that still do the same thing. Like maybe, you know, how can you pick on somebody because their genetic code. Same parents, but you know, one comes out darker skinned or lighter skinned. Curlier hair or straighter hair. 

00:41:20
LORAINNE HEDKE The phrase I remember John speaking about with Juanita it was about how um, this color coding um, divides families. 

00:41:30
ANGEL Mm-hm. 

00:41:30
LORAINNE HEDKE Yes. Yes. Have both, Michelle and Evelyn, you're both nodding about this. Is that similar to your experiences as well or is that different? 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:40
ANGEL Yeah. 

00:41:40
LORAINNE HEDKE Yeah. How, can I ask how that is similar or how that is different for both of you? 

00:41:50
MICHELLE You know it's similar, but because um, I think we receive those messages early on, and it's something that just like what she was saying were taught that. You know, 'cause I remember when I was younger um, I would love to be out in the pool in the sun, and I had other friends who would try to get tan, and while they were tanning I was like, 'I wanna lay out too, cause it's so warm,' and, and then my family would be like, 'Oh my gosh, like, you know I can't believe you got so dark.' And I was like, 'Why is it something so bad?' 

00:42:25
LORAINNE HEDKE To being darker is seen as not good? Is that, or having kinky hair? 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Mm-hm. 

00:42:35
LORAINNE HEDKE Is that my understanding okay? Is it similar to your experience Evelyn. 

00:42:40
EVELYN Yeah it's very similar like with, especially with the fact of going swimming like you do get darker outside and you know, when I was little we would love to go swimming, and your skin would get so dark and so tight and you know, my mom would be like, 'You don't need to stay out in the sun like that. You get too black. You're too black.' And you know, Juanita said something like, 'If you're light skinned you're treated better.' And you know, my family there's definitely a color divide, like my aunt and her kids, my cousins are lighter. They're all lighter, and you know my family, my immediate family, we're all the darker ones, so, you know growing up they always had more than we did. And I just thought that's how it is. Our family we doing things a different way and they have more. Like they're always considered like in the black culture or anybody's culture it's the boogies side, they get you know, they have the nicer cars, the bigger house and we, we didn't have that. 

00:43:35
LORAINNE HEDKE And meaning what you made out of that had something to do with skin color? 

00:43:40
EVELYN I think at an early age yes. I did think that because they were lighter . . . 

00:43:45
LORAINNE HEDKE It's interesting it's about uh, appearance, and not always about personality. 

00:43:50
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:43:50
LORAINNE HEDKE Is that right? Um, so are there other things that other um cords that were struck? Uh, um, things so far that we haven't talked on, about um, other images that come to mind? Um as we were listening to Juanita? 

00:44:10
EVELYN She had mentioned um, if you're dark if you're seen as dark, you know you have nothing to offer, you have short hair, you have um, big nose, big lips. Those types of things definitely stuck out to me. Cause those are images that I've seen from a very young age up until now in my adult life, and there's still that perception out there. Like you're just loud, uneducated, those types of things. Like the darker you are, that's the perception of you. 

00:44:40
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. Right. Yeah. So, so it's something that you notice and it uh, that you've also heard. 

00:44:50
EVELYN Yes. 'Cause it's, it's, it's put out there and in the media. Not to bring, you know this on the media, but that is a stereotype that is still pushed. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:45:00
EVELYN And um, within the black community like within my family um, there are those images that are still put out there even with us being darker, we still think of people that way. 

00:45:15
LORAINNE HEDKE Angel you were also nodding your head. Is that something that . . . 

00:45:20
ANGEL Um, I think when um, I don't know if it was touched upon, but what I kept thinking was uh, uh, this is society in a whole how uh, just things are projected on us and how you know, people you can see their expressions, and you hear their comments, and um So you start to get judgments about yourself. Sort of how she responded about her daughter being called that, you know, her daughter being called names, and um, how she said at first it was just this instant flood of you know, her, her stories coming up and how she um, how then, how it made her feel. And um, that's you know, what's been told to her, what, what she's grown with and even as a woman she still this little girl and those things are still affecting her because either somebody said that to her or you know, society has you know, shown her that or told her that. And within her own family she said also, of which is your immediate small society is your family, um, and that, those messages can be uh, overwhelming I think. And to combat those, you know, she said that you know she'll change how she dresses or you know you come in and you always want to be on you know you want to be happy, you want to be the friendly one, and you want to be, so nobody looks or judges you too quickly. And um, to always have to be on and not just be able to be you and just be at ease um . . . 

00:47:10
LORAINNE HEDKE What do you imagine that's like? 

00:47:15
ANGEL Uh, it's hard. It's hard. 

00:47:20
LORAINNE HEDKE Juanita specifically talked about how um, in spite of having this paralysis as she called it, which is, um was something that Michelle picked up on. Um, that she um, has all these places, kind of these acts where she resists that description. Um, so I'm wondering what it, it is like for you as listeners to her story um, what is it like to hear about her act of resistance? 

00:47:50
EVELYN I think I can definitely relate to that, because um, growing up like my mom always told me like, you might have to perform three times better than you know, your white counterparts, your Asian counterparts whoever, you will always have to preform a little bit better just to be seen as equal. Just to be in the same plain. And a lot of time I know that I'll try to overcompensate, because I know that people see me as a black woman, they're going to think that I'm not smart, that I'm not educated, that I'm just, I don't have much to offer, just like Juanita said. So a lot of times I'll try to educate myself in different areas that typically black people don't do. They don't pay attention to politics like that. That so people think they don't. But you know, I like to be educated in all different areas so I can go into any type of room and be accepted or hope to be accepted, a lot of times I'm not, but I know that I can try to overcompensate because of my race, because of my appearance. Like I want people to see me for more than what they think I am, so I'll, I'll definitely try to prove myself more. And I can relate with Juanita saying that she'll do things to take away from her complection. You know she won't wear black, she won't, she'll wear brighter colors. 

00:49:10
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. Right. 

00:49:10
EVELYN And I can definitely relate to that. 

00:49:15
LORAINNE HEDKE So it's this constant um, um, victory battle um, it is that right? 

00:49:20
EVELYN That's what it feels like. 

00:49:25
LORAINNE HEDKE Yeah, um, um being, um no more than uh, um, disease or paralysis to you know to use Juanita's words. Is that right? And there's, there's heaps of layers, I heard you talk about you know that there's the layer of being female, there's the layer of body image, um, and weight, there's the layers of skin tone, is that, yeah. Yeah, and the gender issues are wrapped up in there so there's a lot of things that we're constantly um, uh, that you're saying Evelyn that, that you have to fight against those places that um, impose paralysis. 

00:50:00
EVELYN Mm-hm. 

00:50:00
LORAINNE HEDKE Is that right? 

00:50:00
EVELYN Yes. 

00:50:00
LORAINNE HEDKE So let me um ask um, you, just a couple of more things before we wrap up to, um, I'm wondering um personally for each one of you, um, how um, the impact of listening to Juanita's conversation, um how it has moved you and how that will stick with you? 

00:50:25
EVELYN I think her, she said something to the effect of being like um, like an advocate or an example of not fitting the stereotype. And that stuck with me because that's, that's her taking the reigns and fighting that battle everyday for someone who doesn't have that strength to fight that battle. You know Juanita, she's she's a beautiful woman, and she's going to inspire other girls that are her similar skin tone going through the same thing. You know just by her continuing to be who she is. And that really stuck with me because of something that I would like to do from my you know, for me being a black woman. Being just that example of the right way to live your life. Be yourself. Be yourself. You have a lot more to offer than what people think you do. So that, that really stuck with me with her saying that. Basically she's okay with that, she's okay with being that model of just a beautiful woman. Beautiful dark woman. A beautiful woman. Educated woman, that's something that stuck with me. 

00:51:35
LORAINNE HEDKE Right. Yeah. What about you Angel? 

00:51:40
ANGEL Um, the mom when she says, when she's talking about her girls. And um, having a, a daughter and son and one being darker skinned and lighter skinned myself. Having being able to, when she said, you know, just that they really didn't have a problem with it. Like she realized that afterwards, and that, and that, that kind of helped her. So that resonated with me being able to you know just be, let my kid show me, you know because we can learn from them. And, and that, that really hit home with me. I was like, yeah, you know just let, just, sometimes we can't out our baggage on the kids and I could go into a whole story, but I won't. You know I could be guilty of that, you know, what I've been exposed to in my life, I don't want to put that upon my children. So if we kind of step back and as a mom just let them show us you know, what do you need help with? Is it you know, did that name really hurt you when they called you that name, then let's talk about that. Or anything that they might battle, um, just you know, like I think Dr. Lindsay said, 'Be their protector, but also be you know, their, their, their guide or you know be able to guide them through whatever they might experience.' I think that really st-, real poignant that, you got to kind of just not let your baggage become their baggage. So . . . 

00:53:15
LORAINNE HEDKE So places where we have felt paralyzed by life, but whatever images, labels had been applied to us, um, not applying then those to our kids automatically. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN And seeing those places where they can call the shots. Is that right? 

00:53:30
ANGEL Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Okay great. 

00:53:35
LORAINNE HEDKE What's going to stay with you Michelle? Um, that is moving and personally important for you? 

00:53:40
MICHELLE Um, it will stay with me that she didn't allow those messages to take over and um, and just let that become the truth. You know, like a teacher, like Dr. Winslade said in the beginning he says, 'You know you're just not good at math.' Then you know you just give up and just say you know, 'I'm just not good at math.' But she didn't allow that to take over. She didn't say well you know I guess I'm disabled and I can't do this and I can't do that. And she really purposely and consistently and consciously fighting against that. That's really like shows how strong she is . 

00:54:30
LORAINNE HEDKE Do you imagine that that speaks to her dreams about who she wants to be? Um, that she didn't just let it take over? Yeah. Hm. 

00:54:40
ANGEL But she's living her dreams. Yeah she is. She's, you know like she said she's successful at work and she's, we know that she's pursuing her education, and these things. You know she's being a stronger mom, she's doing all these things that, are yeah, most definitely, she's beating doing exactly opposite of what the stereotype would assume. So . . . 

00:55:05
LORAINNE HEDKE So let's stop here, because I want, Juanita's been listening to our conversation and I want to give her the opportunity to speak about what she's been listening to. Again, I just want to take a minute to really acknowledge the three of you to be willing to sit with me and share some personal reflections both about what you've heard from Juanita as well as personal pieces of your own life. To share them publicly, um so that we can all learn how to, to live out from under that paralysis of labeling or totalizing. So thank you for doing that with me today. 

00:55:40
EVELYN Thank you. 

00:55:40
LORAINNE HEDKE Yeah, thanks. 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay Juanita, hi again. 

00:55:50
JUANITA Hi. 

00:55:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, and it's been a little while since we talked before and you had a chance to just listen in while um, we saw the video of the first conversation that we had and then listened to the team of listeners and their responses. One of the things Loraine asked Michelle and Angel and Evelyn was about what they were affected by in what you had said and would take from, and I'm wondering what that was like for you to listen to what they said about those things? 

00:56:25
JUANITA Well it was kind of um, refreshing to hear that it was something positive that they would take from it. That they could see the strength in me, that they saw the things outside of my complexion, and um, and could use them in different areas of their own personal lives or um, seeing the world differently that was important for me. Um, but um . . . 

00:57:00
JOHN WINSLADE What was refreshing about it? 

00:57:00
JUANITA Just the fact that they saw me and not my complexion. Because they could have easily said, oh well what I took from it was that dark skin people are not as stupid as she, you know what I'm saying. It could have went a whole different route, but they decided to pick the positive things that I um, fight so much for people to see. So that was um, very important for me. 

00:57:30
JOHN WINSLADE So they saw what you were fighting for people to see. 

00:57:30
JUANITA Right. 

00:57:30
JOHN WINSLADE Does that make a difference to you, that people see that? 

00:57:35
JUANITA It makes a huge difference because like I said, to me I'm representing, even though I'm representing the black race um, which we do, we need so many positive you know whether light skinned or dark skinned, it all boils down to you're still representing the black race, and we need that positive representation in the public so that we can get um, a different name out there for ourselves. A different stereotype out there for ourselves, and so um, it boils down to you being a part of a black race, but at the same time, not being um, um, a part of those stereotypes that have stuck with the black race for so long. And so um, it's very important for me and I think even more so because I am dark skinned um, to, to present myself in certain places, and it also goes the opposite way too. It's also very important for me to make sure that I do know how to talk like I'm black. Because I need to be accepted in every area, not just in the work environment, I need to also know that I'm black, because you don't want to step out of that either. 

00:59:00
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. 

00:59:00
JUANITA And um, and be so white as they per se, or so well spoken, um, that you can't communicate with what's considered you're own race. 

00:59:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Mm-hm. So why is that important? 

00:59:20
JUANITA Well because then you look like what is called a sell out. So you become this person who's now black, but you don't know who you are, and now um, now you're trying to prove something in in, then everybody wants to remind you, don't forget where you came from, and not all black people came from this slang and this and that. There are black people who um, speak very well, you know are educated or um, who, who didn't come from poor homes, but they believe that because you're black you need to um, act like you know what it's like to be poor. Or act like you know what it's like to speak slang or act like you know what it's like to fight. Or whatever it is you need to make sure that you have those characteristics that go along with the black race. So that you don't become this sell out. Basically. So . . . 

01:00:20
JOHN WINSLADE Which is another totalizing just . . . 

01:00:25
JUANITA Right. 

01:00:25
JOHN WINSLADE What I'm hearing you speak about is the kind of dance that you have to do between different descriptions. 

01:00:35
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

01:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE Dark skinned on one hand, sell out on the other . . . 

01:00:40
JUANITA Right. 

01:00:40
JOHN WINSLADE . . . and the other ones in between. 

01:00:40
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

01:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE And you're speaking about the effort you know, I mean I'm hearing um, I think a couple of people, Michelle and Angel talking about how exhausting that is. 

01:01:00
JUANITA It is, it's very exhausting. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE It is. 

01:01:00
JUANITA Very, very tiring. Because you don't, when you win you, you won because you say you won, not because someone else and that's why a lot of times when um, the professors at school say, you know, 'Juanita, you did really well.' I'm like, 'Really?' You know. You may see me as winning, but it takes me to see me as winning, because I'm fighting against so much. 

01:01:30
JOHN WINSLADE Was there any, was there anything in what you heard the listeners say that you thought to yourself something like that, that winning? Was there anything that gave you the, um, any kind of place where that was the case? 

01:01:50
JUANITA Well, like I said, like at the end when they said, you know, she's a strong woman, she said that she does well at work, you know just to even be believable you know, um, that's winning for me. You know, and to have people trust that what I'm s-, what I'm saying that I do and um, and that I'm, that they believe I'm capable of doing that. That means that they're definitely able to see past um, the negative discourse around the totalizing um, around the dark complexion and they're able to believe that yes . . . 

01:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE So this was an experience of being recognized that went past that? 

01:02:35
JUANITA Right. 

01:02:35
JOHN WINSLADE Is that right? 

01:02:35
JUANITA Mm-hm. Because immediately it was the disability came up and then it was um, but she's not disabled. And so for you to be able to see that, and that yeah that was, that was a win, that was winning for me. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hm. Yeah. 

01:02:50
JUANITA Even though I may still describe it as a disability, at least that's my description of it and not . . . 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE Not one being imposed on you. 

01:03:05
JUANITA Right. 

01:03:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so to be just have one or two more questions, but um, like I'm interested in where that takes you to. That, that when you have these experiences like what I'm hearing you describe today, where you have this sense of being recognized, and what you struggling against being recognized and the sense of being a winner . . . 

01:03:30
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE . . . and having that be recognized as well, or winning if you like rather than being a winner, 'cause that could be totalizing too. Right. 

01:03:40
JUANITA Right. 

01:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE Um, I'm wondering where that leads to for you. Like what does that make, what does that open up when you, when you get seen for your experience and for who you are and for what you're trying to express in your own life? 

01:04:00
JUANITA Um, it just opens up it allows the confidence that is there to grow. 

01:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:04:15
JUANITA So that way um, if others see me that way, then obviously I'm doing something right. 

01:04:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:04:25
JUANITA And so if others are able to see me outside of these totalizing um, conversations about black people, dark skinned people, then that means I'm on the right path, and I need to stick to that path and um, and continue because if it was the opposite way then I would be probably doing something wrong and need to change I often wonder why people can't see these things about me. 

01:04:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:04:55
JUANITA So at least me knowing that people are able to see these different things about me then that means that trying harder or um, or um, wearing the brighter colors, or doing well at work, whatever it is I'm doing, it's working. 

01:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you take confidence from, from this come-, this experience in listening to what the listeners have been saying, right? 

01:05:25
JUANITA Oh yeah. 

01:05:30
JOHN WINSLADE And that makes a difference to you. How you go forward in the next step? 

01:05:35
JUANITA Not necessarily how I go forward. But um, it, it can take-, it makes me continue to move in the direction that I'm in. 

01:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, it helps you to continue forward. To continue on. 

01:05:55
JUANITA Right. Right. 

01:05:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well thank you Juanita, I really appreciate the chance to share in this moment and um, what seems to me a recognition of what a totalizing description does, and how it works quite subtly in these powerful undermining, paralyzing, disabling ways. And on the other hand how there are places when we do recognize each other beyond what those paralyzing, disabling, totalizations achieve . . . 

01:06:30
JUANITA Right. 

01:06:30
JOHN WINSLADE . . . that it is possible to find places not which kind of get rid of all of them, but that at least open up other possibilities. 

01:06:40
JUANITA Mm-hm. 

01:06:40
JOHN WINSLADE That one these of being able to win in some places and to go forward and to express what's important to you and how you want to be. So thank you. 

01:06:55
JUANITA You're welcome. Thank you again.
