Microtraining Associates 888-505-5576 www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates Presents Counseling Latino/a Children and Adolescents: Brief Interventions Developed by Enedina Garcia-Vazquez Luis A. Vazquez Mary Bradford Ivey Introduction Enedina Garcia-Vazquez 

00:00:00
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Welcome. My name is Enedina Garcia-Vazquez and I would like to introduce you to our video, "Counseling Latino/ Latina Children and Adolescents." In this video, we would like to provide you with brief interventions to help mental health professionals to provide the best treatment options for Latino and Latina children and adolescents. At present, Latinos comprise 32.5 million or 12 percent of the population, making the Latinos the largest minority group among children and the population as a whole. 

00:01:55
32 million or 12% of the population currently Largest minority group among children and he general population Between 2000-2050 The Latino population will increase to 98 million Largest group among all minority groups 

00:01:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Between 2000 and 2050 there will be 98 million, and in fact, Latinos will comprise the largest minority group among all ethnic groups. 

00:02:05
39% of children in public schools are minority 44% of K-12 student population is Latino 

00:02:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Further, 39 percent of public schools are comprised of students from minority backgrounds. And of these, 44 percent are Latino. In the first vignette, Mary provides an ineffective example of how to work with students. You will notice that Mary makes the student responsible for the teasing that she is experiencing. Therefore, she, in effect, blames the victim. However, in the second example, Mary names the issue, which is racial harassment, and accepts responsibility, not only on behalf of herself, but the whole school in order to help curb the oppression that the student is experiencing. 

00:02:50
Racial Harassment Ineffective Example Mary Bradford Ivey and Angelique Sessions 

00:02:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Hi Angelique. How are you today?

00:03:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And how did that make you feel? 

00:03:45
ANGELIQUE  See, kinda like I didn't really wanna be a Mexican-American. 

00:03:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Well, you know, Angelique, kids tease now. I mean, that's just, that's just one of the things that kids do, and they tease, and, what do you suppose you could do when things like that happen- 

00:04:00
Placing responsibility for the problem on the child 

00:04:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY -and how can you handle it so that, you know, when, when kids are gonna tease like that, what can you do? 

00:04:05
ANGELIQUE Well, I guess, I could try to ignore it. 

00:04:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Yeah, you could. Uh hmm. Anything else? 

00:04:10
ANGELIQUE See, well. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I mean it's gonna probably happen again and again and that's kind of the thing kids just say, that kids say things that are, you know, not very nice. 

00:04:15
Blaming the victim 

00:04:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you have to be able to handle it. 

00:04:20

00:04:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Not so good. Oh, my goodness. What's wrong? 

00:04:40
ANGELIQUE Well, this kid named Gavin(ph), well, I know he's kinda like friends with us and all that, but well, we were all sitting in the cafeteria like we usually do. 

00:04:50

00:05:15
ANGELIQUE See, well, we told him to like quit it and like, you know, telling him that's kinda like rude to be doing that to other people. 

00:05:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It certainly is rude. It's certainly inappropriate. Did you talk to your parents about this? How are your parents by the way? 

00:05:25
ANGELIQUE Hmm. See, well, they're kinda worried about me at school because of it. 

00:05:30

ANGELIQUE See, I think he has... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45

00:05:55
ANGELIQUE Yeah. 

00:05:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...anybody that isn't like him. You know what that, do you know what we call that? Do you know what that's called when there's something like that happens? 

00:06:00
ANGELIQUE See, not really. 

00:06:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's called racial harassment, and it's really inappropriate and something that, ah, our school- 

00:06:05
Names the problem appropriately 

00:06:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - We don't believe in anything like this, we, we try to have policies about this. Our teachers are really trying to address this and make sure that this doesn't happen to kids 'coz it doesn't, ah, it isn't right and, ah, we know all the wonderful strengths that you have. In fact, let's talk about those things, the things that, ah, that, ah, about your family and the strengths that, that you have as a American, Mexican-American because they are so wonderful.

00:08:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It was very nice. It's a special occasion for you all. So you have, I want you to realize just what a wonderful person you are, what a wonderful family you have, what a wonderful cultural history and, and roots that you have and, and to know that things like this happen in school, horrible things that this boy did and, and that we are here at school to help you with things like this and we have to all work together to fight oppression, but really it is, at these ages, our teacher's responsible and they make sure that we talk to Gavin(ph)- 

00:08:25
School system action 

00:08:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - And we talk to his parents and that there are some consequences for acts like that because that really is hurtful and should not happen. You did exactly the right thing, you know? 

00:08:30
Angelique's Parents Comment on the Session Rosario and Scott Sessions 

00:08:30
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Hi Rosario and Scott. Uhm, I'm so glad that you're able to come. You just saw the session between Angelique and the counselor, and of course, we know that this is an acting situation, that it's not necessarily real for Angelique, but we know that these types of things do happen with the children. I wanted to get some feedback from you. What do you, what did you think of this session? 

00:09:05
SCOTT I like that it was a real comfortable atmosphere and that she could express her feelings and talk about, about what was going on. 

00:09:10
ROSARIO  And I feel real comfortable, too, because now I feel like I'm included as a parent where before, you know, she would just go to a counselor and things like that and they would talk about, and sometimes, I wouldn't even find out what was wrong with her or what was going on at school. In this, we were aware with what everything is happening and, you know, we're included in it. 

00:09:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ So then it gives you an opportunity to help... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
ROSARIO Right.(crosstalk) 

00:09:40
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:09:40
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...and rather than just sit back, 

00:09:40
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And watch. 

00:09:40
ROSARIO Yeah. 

00:09:40
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Do you, do you think that there would be anything different that you would have done or things that you might wanna have heard different? 

00:09:50
ROSARIO Hmm. No, not really. uhm, I really like the fact that they asked her questions and she had the opportunity to express what she felt and, you know, what... (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
ROSARIO ...what she did about it, too. 

00:10:00
SCOTT  Yeah, I like that she was able to, be able to come forward and, and talk about it. 

00:10:10
ROSARIO And then she felt comfortable going to the counselor, especially. 

00:10:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Yes.(crosstalk) 

00:10:15
ROSARIO You know, uh hmm. 

00:10:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Well, Angelique seems like a really outgoing, ah, girl anyway... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
ROSARIO Yes (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...and I think that she probably feels comfortable, but I guess having a, a place where she can share her feelings is important for her and, and it sounds like it's also, when you watched the session, ah, to see the kinds of questions that were being asked and, ah, the different types of people that can help her. Ah, what was your feeling, ah, regarding that piece of, of the session? 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:45
SCOTT  Well, she, I like that she was, she was able to, ah, I don't, I don't know, what can you say? 

00:10:55
ROSARIO Well, they, I, I'd like the fact that she was able to express herself and then there was somebody that she could go to without having any, ah, fear of speaking up and, you know, expressing herself. And, uhm, I feel comfortable, too, because, you know, I'm not there to, you know, be, have, "be there" and to protect her and things like that, and I need somebody, it makes me feel good that there's somebody there to support her and that who's gonna be there for her whenever she needs something, you know, when I'm not around, you know, uhm, and to just be there when, you know, for whatever reason she might have. That, that makes me feel a lot more comfortable that she's not alone. 

00:11:40
SCOTT Yeah, that persons out protecting her rights and, and that, that she doesn't be ashamed of, of who she is and where she comes from. I want her to be proud of that and also to respect other, other people. 

00:11:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Excellent. 

00:11:55
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ So, then it sounds like when the counselor was, ah, talking about how the teachers are responsible, the counselors are responsible and everybody at the school is responsible, it gave you a certain level of, of a, ah, a help there... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
ROSARIO Oh, yes. 

00:12:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...and support because you know that she's not gonna be totally alone in the school and everyone's working together to help her be proud of her roots.(crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ROSARIO And, uh hmm, and that helps with her character, too, because, you know, if, it makes her feel more comfortable about, about who she is and how she is, uhm, if she has the people there to support her all the time. 

00:12:30
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Excellent. 

00:12:30
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Well, I really appreciate that you were able to give us this feedback. I know parents don't often get a chance to watch the children in, in a session even if it is a pretend session, but it does tell you that there are other supportive people in the environment and that you can feel comfortable sending your children to school... (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
ROSARIO Right. 

00:12:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...and feel that you can have a part in, in helping them have a good... (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:12:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...experience as well. 

00:12:55
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Anything else or. 

00:12:55
ROSARIO No, I just, you know, I'm just glad that there are individuals in the school that are willing to go out of their way to help the children and that's, that's mainly the thing that matters the most. 

00:13:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Well, I really wanna congratulate you. You have a wonderful daughter and it sounds like she's got really strong supportive parents and I think that helps the school out as well. So, it becomes a partnership rather than just the school doing one thing and the parents doing something totally... (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
ROSARIO Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...separate. So, again, I really wanna thank you for stopping by and giving us your comments today. 

00:13:25
ROSARIO  Thank you. 

00:13:30
SCOTT Thank you. 

00:13:30
Acculturation Introduction Luis A. Vázquez 

00:13:30
LUIS A. VÁZQUEZ  Acculturation is an issue that, that's often misunderstood by counselors. Ah, acculturation involves the involvement of two different cultures coming together to, to, to create change in one or the other of both cultures that a person is, is experiencing. It impacts the school system, the community, and also the families. You'll often find that children come from different types of acculturation level. Some are able to speak Spanish. Some know a little English. Some adhere to more traditional roles in gender. Some adhere to more, ah, liberal roles, uhm, more relevant to the mainstream, to the mainstream culture. In this vignette, you, you'll see the similarities and differences that the young child has when involved with activities with their friends, her family and the community and how these activities are presented throughout the vignette to show the differences and the similarities in the acculturation process for her. 

00:14:35

And then, uhm, like, like some people that don't speak Spanish, they call me Puluma(ph) and that that kinda gets on my nerves 'coz then, like some people that do speak Spanish to call me that and it just gets to my nerves. 

00:15:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  So you're getting a lot of teasing? 

00:15:20

00:15:35
PALOMA NAVA Yeah.

00:15:40
PALOMA NAVA Well, I just tell sometimes to stop, but then like, uhm, they don't stop. So then, I just walk away. 

00:15:45
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
PALOMA NAVA And, uhm, then they come and say sorry, and when I think just like, "Why do you say that?" 

00:15:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
PALOMA NAVA  And just like, and they like, they just stay quiet or like, I don't know. 

00:15:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  So, it doesn't, it doesn't sound like they're really meaning to hurt you but it's still probably... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
PALOMA NAVA Yeah. 

00:16:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...makes you feel bad 'coz you're, that's not your name. What about your parents? What do they think about the school or these kids in the school trying to change your name? 

00:16:10
PALOMA NAVA  They just say that like if they can't- 

00:16:15
Assessing family's acculturation 

00:16:15
PALOMA NAVA - It right then, like if they can't say my name right, then, they can call me Puluma(ph) but they shouldn't really call me pigeon or dove 'coz. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Pigeon or dove. Yeah. 

00:16:25
PALOMA NAVA Yeah. 

00:16:25
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ That's not they gave, name they gave you. 

00:16:25
PALOMA NAVA Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Is Paloma your only name or do you have other names too? 

00:16:30
PALOMA NAVA Ah, I have just my middle name but they usually call me Paloma. 

00:16:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Paloma. And that's the one that you prefer. 

00:16:35
PALOMA NAVA Yeah. 

00:16:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And that's the important part. Well, uhm, if the kids continue to call you these things, ah, what kinds of things do you think, ah, we could work on in order to help you out with that? 

00:16:45
PALOMA NAVA  Hmm. Like maybe, I- 

00:16:50
Brainstorming solutions 

00:16:50
PALOMA NAVA - Sometimes like go to the counselor. 

00:16:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh-huh. 

00:16:50
PALOMA NAVA And I tell them like sometimes like, uhm, like, could you talk to them and tell them not to call me that or like what do I do? And then sometimes, they just tell me to, just tell me to stop and to call you Paloma or Puluma(ph) and not pigeon or dove because it just, you know, and it sometimes hurts me because they call me like, "Oh Dove, come here" or, "Oh, Pigeon," like, "Fly away, Pigeon," or whatever until they get, and that like sometimes hurts my feelings. 

00:17:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Well, then, it sounds, though like they are trying to be hurtful sometimes because they don't care enough to pause and you know... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
PALOMA NAVA Yeah. 

00:17:25
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...think about, have any of your friends ever asked you to help them practice to say their name, your name? 

00:17:30
PALOMA NAVA No. 

00:17:30
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ No. So, they don't even wanna make any effort to help... (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
PALOMA NAVA Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  learn your name. Uhm, well, it sounds like, then, there are some differences here that are taking place, you know? Your name is really important. And that's what everybody knows you by. And if they don't get it right, it's gonna be a problem- 

00:17:45
Reinforcing correct pronunciation of name 

00:17:45
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ -And it sounds like it is hurtful to you. Are there other differences to that we, that you are experiencing 'coz it sounds almost there might be more things going on here. Your name's one thing. Uhm, are there things that you, that your friends do that, ah, you, you can't do because there are still differences with your, with your family- 

00:18:05
Addressing similarities and differences 

00:18:05

Use of Translators Introduction Luis A. Vázquez 

00:20:30
LUIS A. VÁZQUEZ  The use of translators, uhm, in the counseling sessions has become very controversial issue throughout the United States. Uhm, translators are there to work with the professional, to make sure that the professional is able to communicate with their clients, with their parents, and whatever the situation and whatever the setting. In the following two vignettes, you will notice that, that the translator in the first vignette is a child that was chosen, that was the child of the parent. Now, even though it was a very positive situation dealing with giftedness and dealing with educational activities, the child had a great difficulty in communicating with the parent and with the counselor due to lack of being able to understand the terms. In the second vignette, you will see that the counselor had chosen a professional translator who was able to build rapport between the counselor and the parent and made the parent feel much more comfortable in their ability to talk about the positive aspects of gifted education, the, the, the, the, possible education of, of other classes for the child. These are very important concepts. To be taken away from these two vignettes is not only the, the importance and the difficulties even though the situation was positive, but also to be aware that to be a translator requires many, many skills. And to be a counselor who uses a, a translator, the counselor must be able to meet with the translator before the interview, go over through such issues as what the expectations are? How are they gonna communicate? What it means to work with the parent, cultural difference, nuances, and so forth? All of these things are done before the, before the counselor meets with parent. So, when the translator and the counselor meet together, they're able to meet the parents' needs. Also, there should be a debriefing once the session is finished so the counselor and the translator are both aware of what, of what needs to be elaborated upon, what needs to be clarified, and how they both understood the situation. Many times, because of the lack of use of professional translators, we often, we'll ask cafeteria workers, custodial staff, secretaries, and others at the very last minute to come into a session to be able to interpret for parents. And as you can see, from my example alone, how difficult that must be, and how difficult it was for this child. Can you imagine what it must be like with the difficulty for adults to be pulled in at the last minute to conduct such a professional role because the role of the translator is to help and accommodate the counselor meet the needs of the client, not for the client to be able to communicate with the counselor. The translator is an agent of the professional, not for the client. The client knows what language they'll express themselves in. They're the consumer of your services. The counselor, in the delivery of their services, must meet the needs of their clientele. 

00:23:45

Support Systems and Language Use Introduction Mary B. Ivey 

00:36:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  The family tree helps the therapist know the context, while the roots of the tree represent cultural strengths. In this tape, Enedina is a bilingual counselor and shows how important it is to have bilingual staff. But this not always so. You can see the same strategy in English. Note how Enedina explores where and when the child uses Spanish and English. This will help you understand the situation of the child.

00:44:25
Mary B. Ivey 

00:44:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  The acting out child is a challenge to us all. In this video, Luis shares his approach to a child who has been fighting. Note especially his direct approach and how he reframes machismo as a way to help this child become more of a man. 

00:45:00
Machismo and The Acting Out Child Luis A. Vázquez and David Bernal 

00:45:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  You know, you, you've been here several times and, ah, in the last few times when we talked, we talked about your dad. Ah, you told me he was like this macho kinda guy. 

00:45:25
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:45:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What does that mean... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
DAVID BERNAL That. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...when you say real macho? 

00:45:30
DAVID BERNAL I mean, he don't put up on nobody. 

00:45:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ He don't put up on nobody? Has he always been that way? 

00:45:35
Defining machismo 

00:45:35
DAVID BERNAL I think so. 

00:45:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, what does "macho" mean to you besides he doesn't put up with anything? 

00:45:40
DAVID BERNAL  Uhm, I don't know. I'm just, macho? 

00:45:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Is he the man? 

00:45:50
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:45:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Do you wanna be the man? 

00:45:55
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:45:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Is that what macho means to you... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:45:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...to be the man? 

00:45:55
DAVID BERNAL To be the man, I wanna be the man. 

00:46:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What does that mean? Tell me more about that "to be the man." 

00:46:00
DAVID BERNAL I wanna be strong. I wanna be the powerful one. I wanna be like my dad. 

00:46:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, and how does your dad treat your mom? 

00:46:10
DAVID BERNAL Good. 

00:46:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Good? 

00:46:10
Contemporary views of machismo 

00:46:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Does your mom call "the man"? 

00:46:15
DAVID BERNAL Yeah. 

00:46:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ She calls him " the man"? 

00:46:20
DAVID BERNAL You could say that. 

00:46:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And you call "the man"? 

00:46:20
DAVID BERNAL Yeah. 

00:46:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Do you know when we talk about macho, that macho means a lot of different things. The way we look at macho now, it means to be the man, to be the tough guy to use your fist. Macho also means to take care of, to care for, and to support and help somebody especially when they can't help themselves. Does your dad do that? 

00:46:45
DAVID BERNAL No. 

00:46:45
Reframing machismo 

00:46:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  No? Do you do that? 

00:46:50
DAVID BERNAL  Sometimes. 

00:46:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ When? 

00:46:55
DAVID BERNAL When I feel like it, uhm. 

00:46:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Who have you helped, that you really cared for and that you took care of? 

00:47:00
DAVID BERNAL  My baby sister. 

00:47:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Your baby sister? What does she mean to you? 

00:47:10
DAVID BERNAL I love her. 

00:47:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You love her? I noticed when you said that, you smiled and your eyes glittered. What do you think about when you think about your sister? 

00:47:15
Recognizing non-verbals 

00:47:15
DAVID BERNAL  Uhm, I don't know, I just, I like taking care of her coz she's cool, uhm. 

00:47:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What makes you wanna take care of her? 

00:47:30
DAVID BERNAL Coz I mean, I mean, she's like, she's, she's cool, she's. 

00:47:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Hhmm. 

00:47:40
DAVID BERNAL I don't know, I just. 

00:47:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, you take care of her, why does she need somebody to take care of her? 

00:47:40
DAVID BERNAL  Because sometimes she's taking a lot of towels and I'll stay with her and when I go grocery shopping. 

00:47:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, she can't be alone, can't she? 

00:47:50
DAVID BERNAL No. 

00:47:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, she needs somebody there to help her coz she can't help herself, can't she? 

00:47:55
DAVID BERNAL  Yes. She can't help herself. 

00:48:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ She needs somebody to protect her, right? 

00:48:00
DAVID BERNAL  Right. 

00:48:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Because she's not strong enough to go against big people, can't she? 

00:48:05
DAVID BERNAL No, she's not strong enough. 

00:48:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And you take care of her, don't you? 

00:48:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:48:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You know, that person, you're able to beat up and take them out, the dad of that kid you talked about? 

00:48:15
DAVID BERNAL  Yes. 

00:48:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Kids like that need help, too. They need somebody that actually cares about them and can help them instead of beat them up. That's what macho is. Macho just doesn't mean being the man. Macho also means to take care of, to support, and to help those that can't help themselves. 

00:48:45
Re-defining machismo 

00:48:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ That's what a real macho is. Because the word "macho" comes from machismo which means " the man" and the man is the caretaker to protect, not to harm. To care for, not to destroy. And to support, that's a macho. Wouldn't you make that? 

00:49:10
DAVID BERNAL Yeah. 

00:49:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Coz you definitely act macho with your little sister. You love her, you support her, and you care for her. And she knows you're the man coz she can count on you. What do you think of that? 

00:49:30
DAVID BERNAL Make her happy. 

00:49:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Is she for good? (inaudible ) 

00:49:36
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:49:36
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, what kinda macho do you wanna be? The one who fist the man or the one who takes care of people? 

00:49:45
DAVID BERNAL The one who takes care of people. 

00:49:45
Connecting caring with machismo 

00:49:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Because your sister needs you, other people that can't protect themselves someday will need you, too. Your fist isn't gonna help protect anybody except to hurt. And you seem like a good kid inside. What are you gonna do about your anger? So you can become the macho you really wanna be. 

00:50:10
DAVID BERNAL I can control it. 

00:50:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ How? 

00:50:15
Connecting machismo to presenting problem 

00:50:15
DAVID BERNAL By not taking on another people to, just. (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Well, you tell me that, but if I dug right now, how are you gonna control that? 

00:50:25
DAVID BERNAL I'm not gonna pay attention. I'm just gonna walk on more. 

00:50:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, what if I keep bugging you say, "Come on David, what's up?" what are you gonna do? 

00:50:35
DAVID BERNAL I'm gonna say you're not worth it, you're not worth my time, and I'm gonna walk away. 

00:50:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  That's one way to do it and what if I keep chasing you? 

00:50:40
DAVID BERNAL AL: I'll go tell somebody, I'll go find somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ I see. 

00:50:45
DAVID BERNAL ...I'll find teacher. 

00:50:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You know what, I don't need to deal with this, I wanted to talk to Mr.Beman. I don't need to go here coz I wanna be in school and I know if I do this, you're gonna get me out of school and you're still gonna be in school and I'm gonna be in trouble. What do you think of that? 

00:51:00
DAVID BERNAL  Oh yeah, two minutes of gun solution. 

00:51:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ : Now, do you know what a macho is now? 

00:51:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:51:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What's a macho? 

00:51:10
DAVID BERNAL Macho is someone that take care of people. 

00:51:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  They're the man that takes care of people, right? 

00:51:15
DAVID BERNAL Right. 

00:51:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ To support people, to care for them. 

00:51:20
DAVID BERNAL To support people. 

00:51:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What's a macho? 

00:51:20
DAVID BERNAL Macho mean for, to take care of people, and care for people- 

00:51:25
Establishing new definition of machismo 

00:51:25
DAVID BERNAL -and care for people, and, and, uhm, walk away. 

00:51:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ That's a real macho is. Is that the kind you, you wanna be? 

00:51:35
DAVID BERNAL  Yes, sir. 

00:51:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ I wanna work with you, but you're gonna have to work with me. I wanna, I wanna get your back but you're gonna have to be there with me. It's gonna be hard coz I know you don't like to be told what to do. But you're gonna have to trust me. We're gonna have to do this together. I'm gonna talk to your teachers. I'm gonna talk to your principal. And then I'm gonna make up a little contract here and you and I gonna sit down together and go through it. But if I give you my word, you need to give me yours. 

00:52:10
Making a contract 

00:52:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Can you handle that? 

00:52:15
DAVID BERNAL Yes, sir, I can. 

00:52:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Can you be the macho guy that says, " My word is good"? 

00:52:20

LUIS VÁZQUEZ You leave? So you don't punch anybody out at home? 

00:56:40
DAVID BERNAL  No, I just leave. 

00:56:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ How come? 

00:56:45
DAVID BERNAL I'm gonna take it out on another people. 

00:56:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Oh, so when something's happen at home, you go find a kid that you can, you can beat up on? 

00:56:50
DAVID BERNAL  Uh-huh. 

00:56:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Does that happen a lot? 

00:56:55
DAVID BERNAL Yeah, pretty much? 

00:57:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So what's it feel like at home when you get yelled at but you can't fight back? 

00:57:05
DAVID BERNAL Just go outside and run and try to find someone that I can take it on. 

00:57:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Have you ever tried to fight at home? 

00:57:10
DAVID BERNAL  No. 

00:57:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What does your dad say about it? 

00:57:15
DAVID BERNAL  That I shouldn't be doing it, be, being a bully and being, not being to people. 

00:57:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Ah, cause you realize, ah, that after I talked to you, we'll have to bring your father and to talk to him, too. What do you think about that? 

00:57:30
DAVID BERNAL  Uhm, I don't know. 

00:57:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What do you think is he gonna say? 

00:57:40
DAVID BERNAL He's, uhm, might be mad at. 

00:57:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Be mad. So what's he like when he's mad? 

00:57:45
DAVID BERNAL  He's, I don't know. 

00:57:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What, what made you say I don't know? 

00:57:55
DAVID BERNAL I don't know. 

00:57:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  As soon as I started asking about your father, you got real quiet. What happened? 

00:58:00
DAVID BERNAL  Nothing. He's, he gets mad, sometimes. 

00:58:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ How does he treat you when he's mad? 

00:58:10
DAVID BERNAL Hmm, coz, when he's mad, I stay out of his way. 

00:58:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ How come? 

00:58:15
DAVID BERNAL  Coz, I don't want to see him mad at me or yell at me. 

00:58:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What happens when he gets mad at you? 

00:58:20
DAVID BERNAL  He starts yelling in my face. 

00:58:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And then what happens? 

00:58:25
DAVID BERNAL And then I just leave the house and don't wanna come back after that. 

00:58:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Does he chase you down? 

00:58:30
DAVID BERNAL  No. 

00:58:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Do you guys ever talk about it? 

00:58:35
DAVID BERNAL No. 

00:58:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So he screams at you and you, and you take off. 

00:58:40
DAVID BERNAL Yeah. 

00:58:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ When I asked you that question, I noticed when you got quiet, just like you put your head down. What made you wanna do that when you talked about your dad? 

00:58:50
DAVID BERNAL Hhmm, I don't know coz I just don't like talking about like that stuff, with mama, my only parents, my family. I don't like really talking about that kind of stuff in other people. 

00:59:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, you're not allowed to say what's happening at home to anybody else. 

00:59:05
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

00:59:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What's it like to come in here and talk to me? 

00:59:10
DAVID BERNAL Weird. It feels weird. 

00:59:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What's weird about it? 

00:59:15
DAVID BERNAL I don't know, I'm just talking, I don't, I'm not used, I don't usually do that, talk. 

00:59:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ But you use this, don't you? What makes you wanna use those every time, instead of talking to somebody? 

00:59:30
DAVID BERNAL  I don't know, I just, the anger builds up inside me and I just wanna beat them up. 

00:59:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, does anybody else in your family let the anger build up that way? 

00:59:40
DAVID BERNAL  No, just, I just don't like it. 

00:59:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You realize that if you continue to do it, they're probably gonna suspend you. Does that mean anything to you? 

01:00:00
DAVID BERNAL Not really, it don't, I don't, I don't wanna get suspended, but if it happens, it happens. 

01:00:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, it's somebody else's fault, not yours. 

01:00:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:00:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ If I'd call the other kid in, can we have a session between you and the other child, too? 

01:00:15
DAVID BERNAL Yeah. Yes. 

01:00:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Are you gonna behave yourself if we do that? 

01:00:20
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:00:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Now, what's gonna happen next time you run into that kid out, out in the playground? 

01:00:25
DAVID BERNAL  Hmm, I don't know. I'm gonna, 

01:00:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Have you ever been beat up? 

01:00:35
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:00:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What's it like? 

01:00:35
DAVID BERNAL  Uhm, it's not fun. 

01:00:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What did it feel like to you to have somebody just take you over and beat you up? 

01:00:45
DAVID BERNAL  No, I don't like it. 

01:00:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What was it like for you to know that everybody else was cheering the other kid on when you were getting beat up? 

01:00:55
DAVID BERNAL I don't like it. I wanted to get it up off him, and just beat him and do everything I can, but I cannot do it. 

01:01:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What did it feel like to you when it was over? 

01:01:05
DAVID BERNAL  I felt mad and like angry with myself because I didn't do anything. I just let myself. I mean, I didn't fight back. 

01:01:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So, they took away all your power, didn't they, by beating you up? 

01:01:20
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:01:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So you felt like you can't do anything, huh? 

01:01:25
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:01:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What was it like to face everybody else knowing that you had lost the fight? 

01:01:30
DAVID BERNAL I felt weird. I felt like, like I wasn't there, like they are just, they're all laughing at me coz I got beat up. 

01:01:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  So when you went back to school the next day, and you saw these kids and they were standing, they were laughing at you, what was that like for you? 

01:01:50
DAVID BERNAL I didnt like it. I didn't take it, and then I just got angrier and angrier and just starting and wanting to fight all the kids. 

01:01:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  Do you remember the, that kid you told me that you beat up? 

01:02:00
DAVID BERNAL  Yes. 

01:02:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Do you think he feels like that, like you felt when you got beat up? 

01:02:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:02:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What do you make of that? 

01:02:10
DAVID BERNAL  I really don't care about him. 

01:02:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You don't care about the other kid? 

01:02:20
DAVID BERNAL No, coz I didn't like the way he looked at me. 

01:02:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Do you care about yourself? 

01:02:25
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:02:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What's the most important thing about you? 

01:02:30
DAVID BERNAL Hmm, I don't know. 

01:02:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ If I would ask you dad, what's the most important thing about David, what will he say? 

01:02:40
DAVID BERNAL  Personality? 

01:02:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Your personality? 

01:02:45
DAVID BERNAL Uhm, I don't know, really. 

01:02:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ If I ask your grandma, what's the most important thing about you, what would she say? 

01:02:55
DAVID BERNAL I wouldn't know what she could say, or would say. 

01:02:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  I ask your mom. 

01:03:00
DAVID BERNAL Hhmm, my mom? Ah, 

01:03:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ If I were, because when I see and touch you, I see a kid who's got a lot of stuff going on for, but you're real angry inside, and that anger's eating you up, and all I can see is that whoever comes in front of you, you're gonna try to take him out, but there's always gonna be somebody tougher that will probably take you off. And by using your fist, you're never gonna be able to get through, and you won't get to school. What do you make of that? 

01:03:36
DAVID BERNAL  You know, I don't really make of however I care. 

01:03:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You don't care? What do you wanna be when you, when you grow up? 

01:03:50
DAVID BERNAL : I don't know. I haven't decided. I don't know what, what can I be. 

01:03:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  I'm gonna ask you an important question and I want you to give me the best answer. Do you wanna change? 

01:04:05
DAVID BERNAL  Yes. 

01:04:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Do you wanna be somebody else? 

01:04:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes, sir. 

01:04:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What was that? 

01:04:15
DAVID BERNAL Yes, sir. 

01:04:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And what do you think is gonna take for that to happen? 

01:04:15
DAVID BERNAL  It's gonna take a lot of effort. 

01:04:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Effort to do what? 

01:04:20
DAVID BERNAL  To not use my fist, to talk. 

01:04:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And you think you can handle that? Do you think if I dog you right now, you'd be able to take it and not be able to hit me? 

01:04:30
DAVID BERNAL  Yeah. 

01:04:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ How come? 

01:04:35
DAVID BERNAL Because, I, I don't, that, that, you know, that I can't use my fist. I got to talk things, too. 

01:04:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ So, you're trying to tell me that you know how to control your fist when you want to? 

01:04:50
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:04:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And so, when you do use your fist is because you're deciding that it's you that wants to do it, not because the other kid looked at you wrong? 

01:05:00
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:05:00
LUIS VÁZQUEZ What do you make of that? 

01:05:00
DAVID BERNAL  I make. 

01:05:05
LUIS VÁZQUEZ : So you do have a lot of power, huh, to stop yourself from doing that, so you don't get in trouble? 

01:05:10
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:05:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ  What do you want us to do together? Coz, I wanna keep you in school and I want you to make it, but I also need you to tell me, "Hey, Mr. V, I wanna make it, too," but I can't help you if you're going to use your fist to settle everything. I got your back if you're gonna help be do that, but if you're not, it's gonna be hard to keep you in school. Are you gonna work with me, or are you gonna be bailing? 

01:05:45
DAVID BERNAL I'll work with you. 

01:05:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ You know what I expect from my students when they come in like this? 

01:05:50
DAVID BERNAL Huh. 

01:05:50
LUIS VÁZQUEZ I expect them to be honest. I expect them to be respectful, and I expect them to respect other people. And, when other people don't respect them, I expect you to be the bigger man and say, "You know what, I'm not gonna let you control me to use my fist 'coz I'm the one who's gonna get in trouble, not you." Can you handle that? 

01:06:15
DAVID BERNAL Yes, sir. 

01:06:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Are you sure? 

01:06:15
DAVID BERNAL Yes. 

01:06:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ 'Coz, you've been in here several times now, and this is the fifth time I've seen you. 

01:06:20
Debriefing 

01:06:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Joining me for this debriefing is Dr. Mary Ivey and Dr. Luis Vazquez. You noticed in today's sessions that we covered several points regarding culture, acculturation, language, working with families, and some stereotypes as well. What kind of points would you like people to take away with them? 

01:06:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Well, I would like to say that, that I strongly believe that the issues of acculturation are very, very important for counselors to consider in working with children and working with families. From, from acculturation come issues of language, and as you could see in the translator tape, ah, when we use a translator, there were big differences on how we approach these issues, how we have respect for each other, and how we work with the clients. And, and that's very important because I think that kids and parents both need to feel comfortable within those settings. What do you think, Mary? 

01:07:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I was, of course, being a European-American who doesn't speak Spanish, it was really, ah, an experience for me, to, to work in, with these issues and with the children and with the translators. It certainly made a, a wonderful difference to have being(ph) right there at my side, translating and knowing that it was correct and feeling kind of frustrated and uncomfortable with the child. Hmm, you know, feeling like, what can I say, and what words can I make to, that he would understand and it was a, certainly a challenge, that part was very challenging for me. 

01:07:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Exactly. And when I played the parent, I also felt very comfortable 'coz I felt what, when, when you had a professional translator, I felt that I was included. I was part of the session, I was respected as a parent, and that you really, both of you really understood what, what was happening to me. When the, when my child and my son, when he was a translator, I felt left out. Many, many times a counselor only talked to the child and not to me and I felt that I wasn't a part of all that. And to be quite honest with you, I really thought twice as to whether or not I wanted to return back to the school to talk to someone that wasn't talking to me. 

01:08:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Mary, sometimes when we have a translator, we lose out on some of the affect, and the parent might be showing or demonstrating certain affect in, in that the interpreter, translator may not necessarily pick it up. But in this particular case, how did you feel that that came through? 

01:08:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I tried to look at, uhm, you know, you were playing the role of the father, trying to look very carefully at his face to pick up facial expressions and then to say something about that and talk about feelings a little bit as much as I could read from his face, wasn't sure that the translator was picking everything up, but I felt we're very, very close all the way through. 

01:09:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And there was a part where there was some humor, actually, and of course, you didn't laugh quite immediately but that did come later. 

01:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Right. 

01:09:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And so, it seems like it, it was more natural. It worked out. 

01:09:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, it really, it really was. It was, it suddenly made a difference. 

01:09:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Do you feel that it became easier as the session progressed? 

01:09:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Definitely, and I think that I would be a better, hmm, coun-, I mean I would use a translator better if I would speak in shorter sentences(clear throat) that was something I had to learn. 

01:09:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Definitely. 

01:09:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Excuse me. 

01:09:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And, and I also enjoyed the session when, oh, we dealt the issues of acculturation. Ah, when Dr. Vazquez, ah, worked with the young lady to see what the similarities and differences were and what it was like for her to grow up in an environment that the rules for her were very different than the rules for her friends. 

01:09:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:09:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And what that meant for her, to negotiate in her environment, to feel to be a part of, and yet understand that, that her culture was very important and it meant a lot to her. 

01:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, definitely. 

01:10:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Definitely. And in her case, one of the things that stood out for me was that she was dealing with some cultural issues but also some gender role issues. And, sometimes, you can't tease everything out and you have to integrate everything related to that child. So, I was kinda nice, it was nice to hear her come up with these types of things but again, then it makes, the counselor has to make sure that they're able to integrate the child as a whole, rather than compartmentalizing them and just dealing with cultural issues one day and maybe gender issues on another day. So. (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I think you did that very well, how you incorporate all that. It was just a lot of angst going through adolescence and so you're in... (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Yeah. 

01:10:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and they have a gender and the, and, and all this going on, you know? And I think, and, and the cultural issues and parent issues, and I think you handled that beautifully. 

01:10:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Another point, I think, that we need to make is related to the racial harassment that the first student experienced. I think oftentimes we do blame the victim as you showed in the first slide and then later on came back to take ownership because it is all of our responsibility to make sure that we stop this oppression and the children are mainly not in the best position to defend themselves. They do need that support. 

01:11:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY They certainly do, and I wanted to make that point because I think many, ah, counselors, they clipped ah, you know, it's the, it's the problem the child, you know, teasing happens, which is true. Teasing does happen, but that kind of teasing is something that we as uhm, adults, working with the children, whether we're counselors or principals or, or, uhm, teachers, we are the ones that have to help the children with these issues. And it, and really the keyword is education... (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...we need to work with ah, all the children in the school to help them understand oppression, racial oppression. We need to work with that particular child who was causing, uhm, the pain... (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:11:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and, and the seeing this thing, the inappropriate things. Ah, we need to work with he, with that child plus his family, you know, so that they understand. And 'coz oftentimes, where does the child learn these kinds of comments, these racial... (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Right. 

01:11:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...slurs and so forth. They're learning it at home in the family. So the family must be brought in and, and worked with and helped and it just is, is something that we need and we also then have to continue to build up the strength of the victim so that she doesn't feel like the victim, or she's not a victim, ah, we don't want her to be a victim. We want her, you know, and all of us have to stand up for what's right. 

01:12:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Definitely. 

01:12:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ  Are there any other insights, Luis, that you wanted to share with us? 

01:12:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Well, I think, uhm, in our last session with the bully... (crosstalk) 

01:12:25
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Yeah, yeah, 

01:12:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...I think that, uhm that showed how, how such a concept as machismo... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:12:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...can be re-framed into something positive... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:12:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...and so because such issue as familismo(ph)... (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...which is that care family and caring for family, ah, macho... (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:12:40
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...which is being a caretaker and supportive even though some of these can be generalized across Latino groups ... (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...whether they be Cuban, Puerto Rican... (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...and Mexican, uhm, with Carlos these are very important issues for many main traditional Latino families. Of course, you'll see in the translator role play... crosstalk) 

01:12:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:12:55
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...ah, that we did, that even though we spoke Spanish, it was more of a, a Mexican accent, a Mexican-American type style, but that, that doesn't mean the same concepts would not work with Cubans, Puerto Ricans... (crosstalk) 

01:13:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Yes. 

01:13:10
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...and other South American groups. What's very important is that we, we be very aware about their idiosyncrasies... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:13:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...different types of accents... (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...different types of nuances ... (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...and culture nuances. And that's where the professional translator comes in ... (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Hmm. 

01:13:25
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...and plays a very important role in helping the professional being able... (crosstalk) 

01:13:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...To access such an information so they can, so they can serve their client at their best possible level they can...(crosstalk) 

01:13:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. 

01:13:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...to make sure their client's needs are met. 

01:13:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ I'm so glad you mentioned that point about different Latino groups 'coz we do have a variety of Latino groups in this country, and even though the Mexican-American tends to be the largest of the Latino groups... (crosstalk) 

01:13:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...there are many other groups, and although the children that were presented in this video, which were our actors for today... (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...uh hmm, they do, these concepts and principles do apply across groups, and its really important that we use that to integrate and to use in other settings and with other children from various backgrounds. The acculturation level... (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...language, et cetera. 

01:14:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ So I'm glad that you really pointed that out. That's something that I do want the viewers to take away with today. 

01:14:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. 

01:14:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ And then... (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:15
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...one last scene that I would like counselors to take away from is you are the counselor. You are the one providing services. Those who come into your office are the consumer of such services. You have the responsibility to build that rapport, to learn about the different cultures, to be self-aware... (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm. 

01:14:35
LUIS VÁZQUEZ ...of how you impact others just as much as they impact you and how you're going to meet the needs of those that need it the most. 

01:14:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Ideally, I wish we are all bilingual, but some of us aren't and, we have to then... (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Yeah, that's right. 

01:14:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...do things a little bit differently. We have to do it the very best we can by understanding the culture and by using translators well, and, and trying to stand up for the things that are important for these children. 

01:15:00
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And that's very key too because sometimes we also forget that we have basic skills already... (crosstalk) 

01:15:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:15:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ ...and maybe we did learn it in English. 

01:15:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:15:05
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And that doesn't mean that those skills will not necessarily translate to another language. 

01:15:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm. 

01:15:10
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ And we have to remember everything that we too have. All of our strengths as counselors or professionals in order to provide the best service for the students that we serve. 

01:15:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Yes. 

01:15:20
ENEDINA GARCIA-VÁZQUEZ Well, I really appreciate that we have this opportunity to talk and I hope that, ah, we will continue doing some good work with our children and adolescents, particularly our ethnic minority students. 

01:15:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Thank you. 

01:15:30
LUIS VÁZQUEZ Thank you. May God bless us.
