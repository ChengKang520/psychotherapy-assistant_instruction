00:00:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY OK. Well, good afternoon. This is actually, kind of, like, round two. Some of you were here yesterday, where I, uh, did a session with a, uh, on an individual veteran. Today is kind of a couple, family, uh, session, so we'll kind of, go over that. So, like I said yesterday, this is totally unscripted. This is Jodi, my client. Jodi's one of my former grad students. Uh, so I have no clue what she's gonna say. Eh, but that's how real sessions are, right? Most clients don't come in, give you a script, and say this or that. So, uh, I've never seen her in a couples session. I did see her in an individual session and recommended couples therapy, uh, on that. So that's, kind of, the scenario. I'll do, like yesterday, about 40 minutes we'll end. Yesterday, there was a ton of questions, and, uh, and stuff, so we'll kind of do it that way, because it's easier to respond to some of your questions. So, uh, my frame of reference is based on the individual, but I'm an exposure-based therapist by choice, but when I do couples, uh, therapy, we have to shift gears a little bit on that. So that's kind of what it is. So Mallory back there's gonna give me the high sign, or some sign, with about 40, uh, minutes in. Then we'll break, and then, uh, be open to questions. So, some of you see the back of my head, some of you see the shiny part if you're in the front, and, so, uh, that's the plan of attack. So we're gonna get started. So, uh, Jodi, uh, we met, and, uh, we did an intake and a first session, kind of get some frame of reference. And what you talked about, your, uh, concerns that you couldn't sleep. And you were thinking about your deployment all the time, and you're hyper-vigilant. So we laid the groundwork for individual therapy. But, since you suggested that your, uh, spouse, uh, thought everything was literally in your head, that it was yours, that there were, it was your problem. That there wasn't any, uh, thing he could be involved in. Just get a life, basically, and move forward. I suggested, it'd probably be good to do some couples counseling. And obviously, he didn't, 'cause he's not here. And so, uh, we'll shift gears again, uh, on that. This is not uncommon in family sessions, where one doesn't think they're part of the problem. They think it's all the other person's fault. So we can't do, uh, traditional family therapy, but we can certainly start laying the groundwork for some family issues, uh, that you can do, because he might buy in, and come and see eventually. He has that invitation, but he might never come here. And so, uh, because this is an issue that a lot of significant others are very uncomfortable about, and they blame their spouses or significant others about. Be it a, be it if they're, uh, husband and wife, family, you know, father sons, father daughters, mothers sons, all the combinations of significant others type of thing. So what we'll be focusing on will probably be geared to that relationship with your significant other, which is your husband. But it could be, uh, into other situations, which you have shared that you've had children in the military and that type of thing. So that's kind of what we're, uh, we're on. So if I, uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but from our first session you, uh, shared a lot how your husband, uh, wasn't really a supporter of what you're going through. 

00:04:10
JODI JOYCE Right. 

00:04:10
LARRY ASHLEY Like the sleep issues, the hyper-vigilance... 

00:04:15
JODI JOYCE Right. 

00:04:15
LARRY ASHLEY ...he was not a supporter whatsoever, 'cause he basically said just get a life and not. 

00:04:20
JODI JOYCE Right. 

00:04:20
LARRY ASHLEY I'm paraphrasing, but is that basically... 

00:04:20
JODI JOYCE Right. 

00:04:20
LARRY ASHLEY ...what you shared yesterday? 

00:04:20
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:04:25
JODI S. JOYCE He, yes. He doesn't see the, um, our son went in the Army. So I was in the Air Force, our son went in the Army. And he has the visual stress, and the PTSD that most people would see as obvious. Very stressed out, very anxiety, doesn't go to work. 

00:04:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Your son? 

00:04:40
JODI S. JOYCE Our son, yes. 

00:04:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY OK. 

00:04:40
JODI S. JOYCE Doesn't take care of himself. Literally, doesn't wanna do anything. So he relates to that. He can understand that, 'cause he can see it. And so for me, I went back to work, I'm still providing, I'm still doing things and he thinks there's nothing wrong with me. As opposed to our son, he sees the unmotivation, unemployment, the...everything that you would see in a book. As opposed to mine, he just looks at me and says, 'You just can't sleep.' 

00:05:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So, you... do you see, like, like, a double standard, by how he treats your son as opposed to you? 

00:05:15
JODI S. JOYCE Absolutely. 

00:05:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So he's more open with your son, because he has the visual. 

00:05:20
JODI S. JOYCE Well, he believes he went through more than I did. So he was, um, and, to some extent, I've tried to justify that to myself, that maybe that is the case, because I didn't have to, um, a lot of people got injured, but I didn't have to, um, deal with it as close as he did. His friend was blown up right next to him, and so the, uh, the bomb came right on their tent, and he was laying on a cot with a gun next to him, and his friend that was right next to him got blown up, and there was, his, I guess he was right next to him, his duty to pick up the torso and take it to the helicopter. And that's all that was left, and so, that happened many times. And I justified, over and over and over again, that maybe I didn't go through as much, and maybe I shouldn't have to feel this way or be like this. Because I didn't see what he did. 

00:06:10
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:06:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. Well, I think, eh, our society as a whole is kinda...whether it's the formal military or the counseling folks have looked at how they've... the PTSD diagnoses have come about. And basically, you can't get one, at least you used to not be able to get one, unless you were in combat arms, which were in the Army would've been infantry, armor, or artillery. Those were, uh, that, and, uh, that recently changed, uh, which some of us lobbied for a long time to change, because some of the severest cases are not in the combat arms. In fact, sometimes it's easier to, to justify being somebody trying to shoot you. But some of the severest cases are like, medics, grave's registry, you know, mortuary workers, and all that. So it isn't all that. But that's still the stereotype. If you haven't been shot at, or seen stuff happen, uh, then it's in your head as much. But we know that's not, not the case. 

00:07:15
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah. 

00:07:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And part of that education process, if your husband was here, or shows up, we would go over, uh, it's not always the obvious, uh, types of things. Because if you're in an office, and all you do all day long, seven days a week, is write down dead people's names and notify their parents. Those types of things can be, add up too. So I just want you to understand that it isn't always the visual, or the 'blood and guts' stuff that indicate that. It's a big enough problem that you can't sleep, and you have hyper-arousal things from things running around in your head. And it's impacting your relationship, because your husband does not believe that it's a big deal. 

00:08:05
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:08:05
JODI S. JOYCE Well, he's, I'm censored and he's not. 

00:08:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:08:10
JODI S. JOYCE So it's in my head and not his. He doesn't keep anything back. 

00:08:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:08:15
JODI S. JOYCE He lets everything out. Says it all the time, talks all the time, yells all the time, screams. I mean, he just, it's all out on the front and I hold everything in. 

00:08:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. And so, your persona is you don't share much, anyways. Right? 

00:08:30
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:08:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So your husband's more accepted if your son, uh, throws a temper tantrum, and screams and yells, or throws stuff literally, or that? So what does, how does he respond to that? 

00:08:40
JODI S. JOYCE He seems to be a lot more forgiving because of what has happened. He's got a lot of rage. 

00:08:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, what does he...but how does he act? 

00:08:50
JODI S. JOYCE Um, he tells him to knock it off, and stop. He tells me I don't, I shouldn't be thinking the way I do. 

00:08:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But does it work when he tells the son? 

00:08:55
JODI S. JOYCE Oh, no way. 

00:09:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, then... 

00:09:00
JODI S. JOYCE Doesn't work either way, with me or him. 

00:09:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:09:05
JODI S. JOYCE 'Cause he's in denial for both of them. 

00:09:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And he won't, uh, seek any help about it. 

00:09:10
JODI S. JOYCE Oh, no. No no no. He's, this is just a dad being tough on his son. 

00:09:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:09:15
JODI S. JOYCE That's what he says. 

00:09:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And so, you're going to have to work on what you can work on, and you can't change his behavior, only how you respond to him, and your son, might have an impact on him that way. So we're gonna do solo, couples therapy, which is not ideal, but happens in a lot of cases. So our job will be educational, as well as clinical, and we'll play on to some of your individual therapy stuff too. But part of it will be, a large part will be educational, of knowing what the signs and symptoms are, and what the norm is for those types of situations. 

00:09:55
JODI S. JOYCE So, educating me, or me going home and educating him? 'Cause he's not gonna listen to me. 

00:10:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, I don't know if he's going to pay any attention to us, it's educating you. So that maybe you respond differently to them, or what your environment is. 

00:10:10
JODI S. JOYCE But then he know I'm seeing a counselor, so when I come home he's gonna think I'm just telling him what you say. 

00:10:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, he might. But you can't do anything about what he thinks. You know? No matter what you say right now will not, uh, impact him whatsoever, probably, 'cause he don't believe you. 

00:10:25
JODI S. JOYCE Well, he said last night this isn't a counseling session. 

00:10:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, well, to him that's like a dirty word. That's a four-letter word. Counseling session: two four-letter words, you know, type of thing. So if he can reframe it in his own head that if you're just having a chat, that might not, you know... 

00:10:45
JODI S. JOYCE No, there's no communication without it being a counseling session. 

00:10:50
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:10:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, so, I wouldn't...at this point, you can't think too much about what he's gonna think. Because whatever you do, you can't win. 

00:11:00
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:11:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So the focus is gonna be on how maybe you can do stuff in the relationship that will improve your, uh, part of it. And if he buys in, he doesn't buy in. And the reality is in these sessions with family therapy, sometimes you can mend the relationship and sometimes you can't. 

00:11:20
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You know? Ideally it would happen, but it doesn't always happen. 

00:11:25
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:11:25
JODI S. JOYCE Well, we've created it in two different ways. He, our son, stays in his room and doesn't come out, and has become an extreme introvert. 

00:11:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:11:35
JODI S. JOYCE Wants nothing to do with anybody, except for a virtual world. And I don't want to be in the house. 

00:11:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:11:40
JODI S. JOYCE So I have become the extreme workaholic. 

00:11:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. So you avoid being home. 

00:11:45
JODI S. JOYCE Yes. At all. Mm-hmm. And that's probably the sleeping outside, not in the bedroom kind of a thing. The last time I...I didn't do it intentionally, I just did it because that was, that's what drove me. That's what made me happy. Then I realized I was never home. 

00:12:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:12:05
JODI S. JOYCE But when I was, I wasn't present. 

00:12:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But that was, you got some relief doing it that way. 

00:12:10
JODI S. JOYCE Right. So then I found a nighttime job, and then a weekend job, and then an online job. 

00:12:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So your relief is being away from home. 

00:12:20
JODI S. JOYCE Mentally and physically. 

00:12:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, literally and figuratively. 

00:12:25
JODI S. JOYCE Literally. Mm-hmm. 

00:12:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Literally and figuratively. 

00:12:30
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. In the study, on the computer working, away working. Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So your job is a way to disassociate from your home. 

00:12:35
JODI S. JOYCE Keeps me busy. 

00:12:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Keeps you busy. 

00:12:40
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:12:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And you don't any way you can disassociate at home by, and be home at the same time. 

00:12:45
JODI S. JOYCE Not yet, because he's a trigger. 

00:12:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:12:50
JODI S. JOYCE Once again, the noises are a trigger, so, basic cooking...I don't cook. I haven't cooked in a long time. He cooks. Just the fact of him cooking and washing dishes is gonna drive me crazy. The banging of the dishes drives me absolutely insane. I can't do loud noises, so I have to leave the room. Then I get frustrated with him, because he's doing the dishes and cooking, which should not be a bad thing. And then he doesn't understand why I'm upset. 

00:13:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:13:20
JODI S. JOYCE I'm not upset at him cooking, I'm not upset, I'm just, I can't handle the noise. But it's hard not to...I don't know how to tell him that... 

00:13:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:13:25
JODI S. JOYCE ...'cause he doesn't get it. I don't know how to say it's not him, it's not the thing, it's, I just can't do the noise right now. I feel like I wanna sit and just rock. So, hence the music, or the headphones, or something. We've literally, we bought, um, uh, noise, what's the, noise deafening headphone? The headphones that are specifically made to cut all exterior noise. That's how bad it got. 

00:13:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And so, when you're home you wear them all the time? 

00:13:55
JODI S. JOYCE Yes. I try not to, but in situations like that I have to leave, and, which is why we find our son in the same situation, with his headphones on in kind of a way, but, he hasn't gone out to do anything, he has zero motivation to do anything else but that. 

00:14:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, so it's kind of like a Catch-22. 

00:14:15
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. Mm-hmm. 

00:14:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY The environment is toxic. You've got a son, sounds like has a PTSD, his own issues. 

00:14:25
JODI S. JOYCE Who won't go get help. 

00:14:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And he refuses to get help, or talk to anybody, and he withdraws in his own way. And you withdraw in your own way. 

00:14:35
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:14:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And your husband withdraws by saying there's nothing wrong with you. So you've got three people in the house. Uh, they ricochet off each other, uh, and are not a family unit. So... 

00:14:50
JODI S. JOYCE I feel horrible, because he's the one that's keeping the three of us together. 

00:14:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Your son? 

00:14:55
JODI S. JOYCE My husband. Mm-hmm. We don't... neither one of us do laundry. We don't cook. We don't clean. So if I'm gone, and he's, has zero motivation to do anything, he does the entire, he does it all. Like, he takes care of the family inside, and the stuff. I don't touch anything. Neither does our son. 

00:15:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:15:15
JODI S. JOYCE So if we walk away from it, it's, we have to take care of ourselves. And I don't know how that can work. 

00:15:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, I don't know how it's gonna work very much longer either. You're at the breaking point now, I think. Something's got to give, right? 

00:15:30
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So you're doing all kinds of ways to disassociate. So have you thought about, uh, ending the, uh, moving out and ending the relationship altogether? 

00:15:40
JODI S. JOYCE Uh, yes and no. Sometimes. I, I don't know, I, I thought about it. But then we also have our son that... It's like I'm showing him to walk away, and I don't want to show him to walk away. It's that silent, um, I'm gonna, I'm OK. I'm Mom, I'll do it. I'm alright. I'll be fine. I'll be OK. 

00:16:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So, Supermom. Superwife... 

00:16:05
JODI S. JOYCE Right, right. And I can't walk away, and I... 

00:16:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY ...is living in hell. 

00:16:10
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah, but that's OK, because I need to show him that we can do this. 'Cause in my mind, he has it, it was worse, and if I walk away... I don't have a gun, and I told you I was thinking about myself getting one. 

00:16:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:16:20
JODI S. JOYCE He does. He never got rid of his gun. So, he was an Army Ranger and he was trained with a gun, he kept the gun, slept with the gun, he never got rid of it. When he got out last year, he held the gun, and he still has the gun. 

00:16:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
JODI S. JOYCE If I leave, uh, I don't know that I'd do anything. But if I left, I can't... 

00:16:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you're accepting, you're accepting responsibility for your son too, then. That's a heck of a burden. You know? 

00:16:50
JODI S. JOYCE He will not, he will use the gun if I leave. 

00:16:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you're not sure of that. 

00:17:00
JODI S. JOYCE His dad's not keeping him sane. 

00:17:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, who's keeping him sane? 

00:17:00
JODI S. JOYCE I don't know. Some, I'm hoping... 

00:17:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY See? That's what I'm saying. There's a, you know, you could make a case that there's all these accidents waiting to happen, and you probably can't control, no... The only thing you can have an input on is you, so we have to work on coming up with ways that you could, uh, take care of, uh, what's happening with you. 

00:17:25
JODI S. JOYCE But if I think about me, and I do something for me, and then that happens, how do I deal with that? That I took care of me and I was selfish, and then he, he turns on himself. 

00:17:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:17:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But he can anyways. You're accepting responsibility that, whatever, you have that much power and control over your son and your husband. You really don't, you know? If you accept, uh, that you have the control over what they do, then you gotta accept what they don't do. That's a heck of a burden, you know. Something's gotta give, you know. And one of the things that you can work at, we'll work on individually, and we would work on with your husband, uh, if he did come is, uh, there's not any good or bad amount of exposure to trauma, because everybody has a different resilience and responds differently, uh, to that. You're in a no-win situation. You're in pain there and you're in pain here. 

00:18:30
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:18:35
JODI S. JOYCE I think almost, sometimes, watching him go through what he's going through is, makes it worse. Knowing that he won't admit to it. He doesn't think he needs help, and I know he does, and it's just getting worse and worse and worse. 

00:18:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, that could be. But again, how much control do you have over his actions? You accepted a lot of responsibility and power that you think what you do will dictate how your son acts. 

00:19:05
JODI S. JOYCE That's what we do. That's what mom's do. 

00:19:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah? Well, I call it Motheritis, but, uh, you know, where you adopt that. But there's a point that you really don't., you know? In our business, a lot of times we use that co-dependency word, which is basically power. So you've taken on your issues, and you've taken on his. So you've taken on, uh...we've got a co-PTSD relationship: Your son and you, and you feed off of each other. You know? And so we're going to have to look at working on you severing some of that relationship, that co-dependency with your son. Not that it's gonna be easy, but until you start doing that, uh... 

00:19:55
JODI S. JOYCE Meaning I shut off the relationship with him? 

00:19:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you don't accept as much responsibility, and you look at boundaries. This is a boundary type of thing. There's boundaries, you know? He has to, he's not, he might be fragile, but he might not be as fragile as you think. And, uh, guilt. Guilt is a big thing you're going through. You know, you feel guilty if you should, you feel guilty if you shouldn't. You feel guilty if you did this, you feel guilty if you didn't do this. And he knows that, too. And your husband knows that. And they know how to play the guilt card. And it works. 

00:20:35
JODI S. JOYCE Well, he would have never. I was the first person in the entire family, on both sides, to be in the military. 

00:20:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Mm-hmm. 

00:20:40
JODI S. JOYCE He would have never gone in the military, if I wasn't in the military. 

00:20:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY How do you know that? See, you're, you're doing a lot of self-talk. The woulda, shoulda, coulda. If I hadn't done this, then he wouldn't have done this. If I would've done this, then he wouldn't have done this. Or if I'd done this, he would've done this. You don't know that. But you're taking on that burden, and it's a heavy burden. And so until you start working on, you don't have that much control. You really don't. You have no control in the house, when you look at it. They've got you outta the house all the time. 

00:21:20
JODI S. JOYCE They did? 

00:21:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, by the reactions make you want to leave. 

00:21:25
JODI S. JOYCE OK. 

00:21:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So look at how you're avoiding being home. 

00:21:30
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You're home, you're gone more than you're home, so how much control do you really have? You know? 

00:21:40
JODI S. JOYCE So, is part of that switching it? 

00:21:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, part of it, a major part will be you taking control over your actions. I keep going back to you can't assume responsibility and take control of them. Well, you can assume responsibility, that's what you've been doing, but, you can't, you know, you're not gonna, you can't make them change anything. It hasn't worked so far, right? 

00:22:00
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:22:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And you're the one paying, you know, no matter what you do. Your son is holed up in his room, turning on his, uh, tech stuff, and being in another world. Your husband does this, and does this, and does that, and he knows that bothers you. So you stay away from there. And so, you're never there. You're either working around the clock, or when you're home you're not in there. 

00:22:30
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:22:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY 'Cause you sleep on a chair looking at the front door, and you're trying to block out your environment. So, I would assume that's not very comfortable. 

00:22:45
JODI S. JOYCE It's tough, 'cause the difference between blocking out, and it's, it's like the environment is constantly there, and I'm trying to stop what's, I'm seeing. And trying to come back to reality of what's happening right now. 

00:22:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But it doesn't, isn't, isn't working, is it? 

00:23:00
JODI S. JOYCE No, 'cause it's just a movie playing in my head and I can't, it's like, I'm trying to... 

00:23:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But, but you're telling yourself, the self-talk says, uh, I woulda, shoulda, coulda, if I, I'm responsible, and based on what I do, they're gonna do this...or not do this. 

00:23:15
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:23:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So you're kind of trapped. 

00:23:20
JODI S. JOYCE Well, I didn't even realize the woulda of that, because I only, what I only think about all day long is the woulda, shoulda, coulda over there. 

00:23:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:23:30
JODI S. JOYCE So I... 

00:23:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But you can't change over there. It's done. It's all done, you can't do anything. 

00:23:35
JODI S. JOYCE But that's what plays in my head, all the time. 

00:23:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Oh, I noticed. So part of it is being grounded again, and the reality of what you can control, and like we talked about, uh, in our first session, what you can control, your expectations. You've been like this for many years, uh, and so, uh, the movement is not gonna be earth-shattering up front. It's gonna be small things, which you might not even recognize, uh, that. So it's kinda like empowering yourself and giving you some control over what you can do. 

00:24:15
JODI S. JOYCE And that happens how? 

00:24:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:24:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, it happens by starting. You know, having a head set that you're willing to try something new and explore. Up front, who knows, uh, what it's gonna be? But part of it, I would say, was start to look at some positive self-talk. That you're a good person, and you didn't make your son like he is, you didn't make your husband like he is. That's their own business. And what can you actually control? Which might be starting out not feeling like being afraid, or wanting to go home. 'Cause most people in the same boat would probably wanna be at home. So you don't want to be home, but you don't wanna set, uh, have the relationship change. Because if you're saying that if you move forward in a positive way, that'll destroy your relationship with your son. 

00:25:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And your husband, or both. 

00:25:15
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:25:15
JODI S. JOYCE Definitely my husband. I'm not sure it would destroy the relationship, I'm just afraid he would take actions against himself. 

00:25:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Your son? 

00:25:25
JODI S. JOYCE Yes. 

00:25:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But how would it, uh, destroy your relationship with your husband? 

00:25:30
JODI S. JOYCE Oh, if I left? Meaning for me? 

00:25:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:35
JODI S. JOYCE I don't know. 

00:25:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY We keep going back to the power that you've given your son. You've given all your power to your son. 

00:25:45
JODI S. JOYCE So he's controlling the house. 

00:25:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY He runs the place. If he acts a certain way, your husband acts a certain way. 

00:25:50
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY If he acts a certain way, you act a certain way. 

00:25:55
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY It's his house. Are you willing to work at taking back your own house? Which starts with how do you take back your own brain. You know? They're living rent free in your head. 

00:26:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. 

00:26:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And they know it. 

00:26:15
JODI S. JOYCE So he knows he's getting off scot-free. 

00:26:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, he knows how to control you. 

00:26:25
JODI S. JOYCE Through him being in his own process? 

00:26:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, or acting certain ways, or implying things, 'cause he doesn't even have to do anything. You just, he can imply he's gonna do certain things, and then you act in this way. Mm-hmm, you know? 

00:26:45
JODI S. JOYCE OK. 

00:26:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So it's gotta be unbearable, it's gotta be painful. So not only what's running in your head, there's the safety factor of being afraid to go to sleep. You can't sleep, so you have sleep deprivation, which is like being high. You know, so you're exhausted, but you're so tired you can't go to sleep. 

00:27:05
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:27:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And it's, it's a cycle. 

00:27:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:27:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So I'm guessing you can't, your eating habits are not very good... 

00:27:15
JODI S. JOYCE Lost a lot of weight. 

00:27:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY ...or almost non-existent, productive, and there can be all kinds of things. 

00:27:20
JODI S. JOYCE Right. 

00:27:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Your immune system is probably, really running amok, so you get sick more often. 

00:27:25
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Whether it's headaches, or upset stomach, or whatever. 

00:27:30
JODI S. JOYCE Oh, the stomach's all the time. 

00:27:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Non-stop. 

00:27:35
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. From the sleep or from the stress? 

00:27:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, they're all together, right? 

00:27:40
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You can't sleep because you're stressed out. If you're getting, you're not sleeping, that stresses you. You know? Uh, the high stress, that impacts your immune system. If your stomach's on fire, you don't feel like eating. If you're thinking too much, you can't go to sleep, even if you're exhausted. And if you do go to sleep, when you wake up, you feel like you haven't been to sleep. 

00:28:10
JODI S. JOYCE So, I, I'm overwhelmed. 

00:28:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:28:15
JODI S. JOYCE Yeah. So we talked about me, and now I'm supposed to handle this at the same time? 

00:28:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY No, all you can handle is you. You can't, you know, but your expectations are that you should be able to handle your son and your husband. You know? 

00:28:35
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:28:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And when they partner up, that's not a double-whammy, that's a triple-whammy. 

00:28:40
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:28:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And you accept that as the norm, and that's the way it should be. 

00:28:45
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:28:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But look at the pain you're going through. You're, uh, hopefully you'll get to the point where you see that pain is more painful than the pain of trying something new. So you're kinda locked in a, in a spot. Damned if you do, and damned if you don't. 

00:29:10
JODI S. JOYCE Which is why I don't understand, if...are we gonna work on trying to get them here, or am I gonna just work on me? 

00:29:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, right now, we're working on you, you know? You can't make your husband or, or, or your son go into treatment. 

00:29:20
JODI S. JOYCE I don't think I can handle both at the same time. 

00:29:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY No, that, so we gotta work on you, you know? It's not, like I say, it's solo couples therapy. It's not the same, you know, uh, and he might never come, ever, 'cause he's got his own things. So it's about you. Be willing in exploring, you know, different options that seem to fit, you know, and so, uh, it's not unbearable to go home. Or, if you're in your home, how do you get your brain not racing? And so, a lot, part of that is learning how to think different things, and over the course of time we'll come up, uh, you know, with exercises that are, will approach your environment like we will, uh, approach you. So this is quite a house, isn't it? 

00:30:15
JODI S. JOYCE Hmm. 

00:30:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Son with PTSD, you with PTSD, who knows what your husband's got? He can have secondary PTSD, or traumatic stress from being exposed to all of that. So you've got three people that could make the diagnosis, you could make a case that have all, some form of PTSD or type, and you feed off each other. You know, and you can't do anything with them. So... 

00:30:45
JODI S. JOYCE Do you see it, do you see it me running first, or him? 

00:30:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball. But you can't really, probably, keep thinking about what they're going to do, 'cause it's all conjecture. You go back to your responsibility, your number one responsibility is to Jodi. Right now, you sacrifice all of your entity for your son and your husband. 

00:31:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:31:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY They run the house. You really have no control, you just think you do, because you keep telling yourself that in your head, until you believe it. 

00:31:25
JODI S. JOYCE That's how I see it. 

00:31:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, and I bet you don't invite anybody over to the house, do you? 

00:31:30
JODI S. JOYCE Never. 

00:31:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY No company. 

00:31:35
JODI S. JOYCE Not in years. 

00:31:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Because, the... 

00:31:35
JODI S. JOYCE I'm not there to help them. 

00:31:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, even if you were, you don't want the house, any company to see the environment in the house. 

00:31:40
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. No. 

00:31:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So you really are alone. 

00:31:50
JODI S. JOYCE But I don't understand. If he can see this happening, and he can see the stress, and he can see the fact that I can't sleep in the same room, and that I'm never home, I don't understand how he can't, and he sees him, he accepts him, why he can't accept me. 

00:32:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you're spending a lot energy trying to figure out what he thinks. A lot of times, people...two people can look at the same thing, and one doesn't see a darn thing, and the other people have some clarity. So you see that, you assume they have ESP and can read your brain and what's going through it. Your husband's probably oblivious, that's his defense mechanism. 

00:32:25
JODI S. JOYCE So it doesn't matter that he ever gets it. 

00:32:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY No, well, I don't know. He doesn't get it right now. Or if he does it doesn't appear like he gets it. 

00:32:30
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:32:30
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:32:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Your son's in another world. 

00:32:35
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:32:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY He's like in outer space. 

00:32:35
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. That's OK, though, for him. 

00:32:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, there's not anything you can do about too much. 

00:32:45
JODI S. JOYCE No, I meant for my husband. That's OK for him to be like that. 

00:32:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY I don't know, I'm not saying it's OK. There's just, there's, you just don't have control over what your husband's gonna look at. 

00:32:55
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:32:55
DR. LARRY ASHLEY He's not willing to come in and have a conversation, even if it's not framed in, in, in counseling, just some educational things, uh, uh, about that. So, a lot of stuff is conjecture on your part as to what he thinks. 

00:33:05
Jodi S. Joyce 

00:33:10
JODI S. JOYCE Well, I don't have the issue, and the person that's supposed to have counseling is not here, which is our son. So he doesn't need the counseling, 'cause he doesn't have the issue. Only our son does. 

00:33:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, that's, that's in his head, and you can't do anything about it. It goes back to only by your changing, that might have some impact. Right now, you have no impact. No matter what you tell your husband, right now, he doesn't get it. Or he has blame for you... 

00:33:40
JODI S. JOYCE And what sort of things would change that? Or being me? 

00:33:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Once you start thinking of different things, then you might physically start changing things. You might be home more often. You refuse to be sittin' in the chair, you're, just by your actions. 

00:34:00
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. 

00:34:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Not what you say, necessarily, but how you do stuff. Your presence in the house, you're felt in the house. Right now, you're invisible, in the house. Until you're not invisible, and they start to know, ah, Jodi lives here too, and this is how I know she lives here, then you might hit at that. But if you're afraid to make any movement on your part because of them, then you're not going to make any. You're paralyzed. And right now, you're paralyzed. 

00:34:25
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:34:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY So how much pain are you in? 

00:34:30
JODI S. JOYCE A lot. 

00:34:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Usually, people don't make any changes unless they're uncomfortable. 

00:34:35
JODI S. JOYCE The problem is if I do that, I'm gonna make myself 10 times more uncomfortable by being at home. 

00:34:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you don't know. Again, that's in your head. You're doing a lot of, uh, thinking like you have a crystal ball. So you're paralyzed, you won't try anything. What do you have to lose? How can it get more uncomfortable? 

00:34:55
JODI S. JOYCE It could get worse. They could leave. 

00:35:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well? That solves some problems then, doesn't it? You're afraid to move, for you, because they might do this. 

00:35:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:35:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY That's, again, the responsibility you've taken on. 

00:35:10
JODI S. JOYCE I keep it myself. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, so you're the mother, not just for your son, you're the mother for your husband. 

00:35:15
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You're more of a mother than, uh, a wife, based on what you're saying. 

00:35:25
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:35:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You know? So, you're looking at two things that are very uncomfortable. But, so far, you've made a decision by not making a decision, and it's coming down the homestretch, where if you don't make a decision, somebody will make it. They might leave, they might run a, run amok, or you run away, or there could be all kinds of things. Right now, you're in a spot where you can start to make some choices, be they uncomfortable. But how much more uncomfortable can you do by making some small changes, little changes, than what you're doing now? You're miserable. 

00:36:10
JODI S. JOYCE Making them miserable. 

00:36:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, but that's them, again. You keep going back to them. This is about you. You know? And they're not gonna be, uh, big changes, probably. You might not even recognize you're making any changes. They might be the one that recognizes the changes before you make your, recognize your own changes. 

00:36:35
JODI S. JOYCE Do we go with the work first, or do we go with the sleep first? 

00:36:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, I think they're so tied together, you know? It's, uh, it's like a banana. You peel one, then you got another one, then you got another one. I think they're so inter, uh, interconnected, that just by making some choices in your home environment with how you react to, uh, the noise, uh, certain things at home, you might see, you know, impact how you are at work, and all those types of things. But the bottom line is, since we don't have crystal balls, we don't know until we try. So you gotta, you know, be willing to try something without any guarantee. You're right. You could change something and they both leave. That could happen. You know? But how could that be worse than the house you're living in now? 

00:37:30
JODI S. JOYCE I'd be all by myself. 

00:37:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you're by yourself now. You're by yourself with, in a house of three. And change is difficult. Change is very hard, uh, because we never know what the ramifications are going to be. 

00:37:45
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:37:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But when you go home, you're guaranteed that you're gonna know how your husband's gonna act, and you know how your son is, uh, gonna act, and no matter how uncomfortable they are, you know how they're gonna act. Pretty much. 

00:37:55
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And you're familiar with the uncomfortability, no matter how bad it is? No matter how much it's like a sewer, you're familiar with it? 

00:38:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm-hmm. 

00:38:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY It's just a scary thing as trying something, trying to find something new. Or, another thing we'll end up exploring is, do you think you're worthy of change, that you deserve to change and be happy? You know? Sounds like you think that you deserve what you got, in some ways. 

00:38:30
JODI S. JOYCE I have to take care of our son first. 

00:38:30
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Why? 

00:38:35
JODI S. JOYCE That's what a mom is supposed to do. 

00:38:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY How old is your son? 

00:38:35
JODI S. JOYCE Twenty. 

00:38:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:38:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY And when he's 35, or 45? 'Cause I, I work with folks that the son's 50, and 60, and still living at home. And mother's been taking...has been mother for that long, and the son dictates everything. Do you deserve to be happy? 

00:39:05
JODI S. JOYCE Sure. 

00:39:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You do? That's what you're saying, but, you know, you think they deserve, they're number one. 

00:39:10
JODI S. JOYCE First. 

00:39:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY First. 

00:39:15
JODI S. JOYCE I gave up being selfish when I had a kid. 

00:39:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY What's it, what's it got to do with being selfish? If you're thinking... 

00:39:25
JODI S. JOYCE They've always come first. 

00:39:25
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, but if you think, if you buy into selfishness, that's a negative thought. Aren't you entitled to some Jodi time? Aren't you entitled to some time that's not all with your son? You know, where your son is not running around in your head, or your husband? 

00:39:40
JODI S. JOYCE It's been a long time. 

00:39:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY I know it's been a long time. But, aren't you entitled to that? So, you know, part of the process we're gonna go through, over the long haul, whatever that means, is, you know, start to think some positives. It's alright to think this way. I'm entitled to think this way. It would be great if my husband is sitting here, but he's not now. But what can I do to take back my life? Without sacrificing my life all the time, for my husband, and my son. Because, sometimes the most powerful way of saying yes is to say no. You don't know how to say no. You're like a sponge, and so they're always sucking, you know, sucking that in there. And it doesn't happen overnight, because you've been living like this for 10 or 15 years in various states. Going through your own thing, now your son's thing, and, you know, the husband, uh, in there. So, if you had 15 people living in the house it probably wouldn't be any more hectic than the 3 of you. You know? But I think, it'll start by you thinking that you're worth it. And self-worth comes from inside, no matter what they say. They're in their own worlds, but I would, uh, conjecture, that if you start to change by how you think about yourself, that'd be manifested by how you physically act, you might see some change from them, you might not. But, they're not changing now. So you have to take a look at, do you have anything to lose? You know? And, uh, you're in a lot of pain. 

00:41:40
JODI S. JOYCE And a lot more anxiety now than I was an hour ago, though. 

00:41:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. Well... 

00:41:45
JODI S. JOYCE Pain or anxiety, which one? 

00:41:45
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, who knows? You can pick, eh, to get to the other side of the road can be a lot of pain. To have good things happen can go through pain. You know? People don't choose to go to counseling 'cause they want a vacation. Well, they might, but as a rule it doesn't really, uh, do that. But, you know, before you feel relief you might feel worse. 

00:42:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. 

00:42:10
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:42:15
DR. LARRY ASHLEY In your case, it's going to be kinda hard to feel worse than you do now, but, you know, when you're trying that. And what, sometimes you have to try things over and over. So hopefully, if you try something and it doesn't seem to work, you just don't give up. But, uh, emotionally you're frazzled, physically you're frazzled. You're just, you know, you're frazzled. So, you know, you got, uh, two or three issues. You've got your own issues, you've got your family issues, and they bleed over into each other. And so, probably the focus, if we can't get your husband here on both parts, will be focusing on you, uh, and empowering you, uh, to look at things differently and move forward. And as crude at it sounds, let the chips fall where they may. You just don't want any chips to fall. 

00:43:10
JODI S. JOYCE Mm. 

00:43:10
DR. LARRY ASHLEY But they're falling all over you right now. And other people deciding what the chips are, not you. So, we'll pull the plug there, uh, kind of open the questions. It's not uncommon, though, in this, because, uh, this is a heavy issue, uh, to get significant others, be that children, wives, husbands, dogs, or cats that wanna be involved, so it's like doing family therapy with one person. Is it ideal? No. Is it better than nothing? Yeah. In this case, uh, Jodi has her own baggage from her own stuff. And, uh, you know, uh, it's like, eh, HIV works. Sometimes people think there's good ways and bad ways of getting HIV, relatively speaking. It's just like with PTSD. Do I get it because of this? Does it make it worse because of this, or this? It really don't matter. But it does to her, because she's saying that she didn't get shot at, or shot, or, or things. And so she doesn't have the, you know, that, the good kind of PTSD. She has the kind, she doesn't have the bad stuff like the son, and that plays around in her head, over and over. And her husband's in oblivion. He's in outer space one way or the other, and, uh, while he blames her more than the son, he don't do anything to the son. The son runs the house for everybody. So, when the son says jump, they wanna know how high. 

00:44:55
What is the first step you take to make the client feel more at ease? 

00:44:55
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:45:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, uh, there, there can be some simple, uh, things, uh, this was a shorter than normal session, but working on how to de-stress, you know, breathing exercises, some things to get some relief and power that she can, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, have some impact. The thing is, clients wanna see major impact right now. So we have to work on the crawling parts. You know? How can you de-stress? You know, it sounds simple, but even when we work with, eh, folks that have, uh, a short fuse and anger stuff, uh, you know, uh, just learning how to take deep breaths and count to 10 before something, you hit something. Or those certain types of things we would try to, something that's real, uh, you know, uh, but relaxation. How to relax, progressive relaxation. Some things you can do at work, you can do wherever, you know, just some basic stuff so that she can see she had some impact on, uh, on that. If I had longer, I would probably start...give her some homework before she left to do some of those types of things. And learn how to do some positive affirmations and self-talk, and have some sort of, uh, control. But it didn't happen overnight, so it's not going to change overnight. That's, we want it to change overnight, but... Another thing you handle with clients. You can see positive change, uh, but it isn't the kind of change they expected or wanted. Right? 'Cause they have in their head set preconceived notion of what change should be, and it isn't like that. Right? It's like, you have, you see clients that come in, and, with their own treatment plan, and they give it to you. Right? Well, if they don't you know they got one, because then, uh...Oh, this, uh, we're gonna shift gears, oh, but here's my treatment, here's... I know, but they don't practice what they do, you know, so... 

00:47:00
Do you focus first on the client and then the family? 

00:47:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah. 

00:47:05
JODI S. JOYCE Yesterday. 

00:47:05
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:47:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Because she would present it initially for her own PTSD. So we laid the groundwork, and as she shared environmental things I recommended she try to get her husband in. If he never comes in, which he probably won't for a while, unless something probably would happen, that will be part of the focus. So we'll do a combination stuff of her, hers and how the environmental thing. Because they're so intertwined it's kinda hard to, hard to separate them. 

00:47:35
Typically in the beginning, do you focus on things such as events and triggers? 

00:47:35
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:47:40
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Yeah, I, I kinda want, because, uh, it's really individualized. So, uh, I've seen tons of PTSD cases. They all have a different story. There might be some similar, uh, things. I, I see a lot of differences with women than men, not good, or bad, or ugly, but, I, I, uh, this shame and, uh, guilt are very common. What I, my term: Motheritis. It's not a derogatory thing, but, you know, some of that, uh, I've seen Fatheritis too. But, uh, uh, accepting responsibility, uh, for no matter how old, then...because that's what a [0 0:48:15]parent does, you know, does. And the reality is no matter how hard it is, uh, we can't change anybody. No matter how much. The only changes...maybe by how we change, that might impact them. But life is a roller coaster, in that, so... In, in, folks who work in the drug business, we have this phrase, uh, tired of being tired, living rent-free in your head, you know, all of those types of things. I tend to do more of a tough love approach, even with, uh, when I'm working with, uh, combat trauma types of things. And I shared, yesterday, uh, there's a 12-step approach that I challenge you to find, but it's called War Veterans Anonymous, in which, if you took out drugs, you put in victim. So people with PTSD, whether it's family or not, they have adopted the victim role. If you're a victim, it's everybody else's... Stuff was done to you, and a lot of times victims won't accept any responsibility, so no matter how much crap was done to you, 'cause life is not fair, you still have a role in how you interpret the crap. But the problem is, the longer you get in the sewer, the more that becomes the norm, 'cause you're familiar with shit. You know? And trying something new is scary, even if you might reframe it in a positive way. So it becomes very hard. This might not...I'm not a fan of brief therapy, just depending on the severity, because of that. Typical brief therapy, you know, and if you're doing insurance or that, they figure you can cure people in three or four sessions. You gotta have big Band-Aids, of course, but, uh, uh...so it just depends, uh, you know, uh, how long? I recently worked with a, uh, a person that was referred to me by the FBI, that was a, worked an oil rig in, uh, Africa, and the guerillas kidnapped him off the oil rig, and for 40 days held him hostage, and threatened to kill him every day, did every, all of the stuff, severe... I worked with him for three years, every week. So this is a long term process. So for the first year or two it looked like he was just learning how to crawl. You know, how we, to take all that crap out of his head. You know? So typically, you don't have that opportunity, and that was a rare exception, but the severity was, warranted the, warranted that. There's no way, uh, a typical insurance would pay for that. He happened to be, uh, the company had guilt for what happened, and they owed it to the man, uh, you know, and I gave them a heck of a rate, but, uh, you know, it just depends. You know? So, uh, you take into consideration age, gender, you know, situation. So in this case this is, there's a lot of work. Hers, and as long as she's in that house, a ton of work. And she's not gonna get support from the house, so where's she gonna get it? If she can't pat herself on the back, she ain't getting it at home. And it's like being trapped in a box, uh, you know. It's like being in the hole in the prison, right? You're in solitary confinement. Damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Then you're damned all over again, depending. Right? And the family knows how to play those cards, right? The son knows if he throws a tantrum, and threatens this, or happens to walk out with his pistol, or implies stuff. Total control. So, you know, and you've gotta just be flexible. You gotta be, you know, you might shift gears a dozen times in the course of the treatment. 

00:52:15
In what way would you look at substance abuse? Would you possibly use a more interpersonal theory? 

00:52:15
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:52:20
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you would look at exploring stuff. I always believe in having a full toolbox, with pliers, and hammers, and screwdrivers, and, uh, uh, that. So there'd be a lot of, uh, things to explore. But, initially I wouldn't get in too much in the theory stuff. I would try to get some immediate relief somehow, through relaxation, or breathing, or something just to take, so she's not on fire all the time, emotionally, uh, on that. And I might see her, uh, uh, more often up front, just to start getting a lot of oxygen in there, as much as possible. But I don't believe in spending a lot of time spinning wheels. So, when you're in crisis, if things are, if I don't see some movement in three, or four, or five sessions, then I'm gonna shift gears and get another pair of pliers out, or, you know, or something, uh, uh, to do that. What I see as a... Of course, I'm opinionated. So I assume everybody has co-occurring disorders. You can't tell the difference, I don't think, up front, so I, I really believe in going in high. It's easier to downshift than to upshift. So I go in, I don't know what I'm looking at. Addiction and mental health are identical, almost. I can't hardly tell the difference. You know? So you gotta be, uh, flexible, and, so here's what I... My day job is I train therapists, be it psychologists, MFDs, uh, whatever, and on a good day, I get after the psychiatrists. So, uh, typically, and, 'if it don't apply, let it fly,' to all the students in here, you know, they come to me and say they can't think they're a real therapist until they have a philosophy, or a theory. You know? And I'm not saying, I'm not anti-theory, but I think we can over-theory people. And so, my thing is find out who you are, and the theory will find you. So it's the Ashley Ass-Backwards Approach. So, uh, you know, find out, because you're not a good hammer person if this don't fit. So find out who you are in that, and, you know, it's different strokes for different folks, on that. There's not one answer, but I'll go back to being flexible. You know, if you have, you're seeing a client for, uh, 10, or 11, or 12 times and there's no movement, shift gears. It's not their fault, it's yours. We always are blaming clients. Why do we expect that the clients have their act together? Or, well? You ever had a well client? Yeah, I once had one. You know? So, uh, we get upset at them 'cause they don't do what we say. That means we take it personal. Once we take it personal, we've lost. Do you get paid more if you take it personal, or not take it personal? I didn't think you did. I don't think you have a special rate for personal or unpersonal. But we, that's our moral inventory, you know? And I mentioned yesterday, a trend that's happening that really bothers me, of civilian therapists that won't take combat veterans into treatment, 'cause they're freaked out. Because they have this stigma and stereotype that they're all gonna run amok. On that, you know, most of them are human beings too. And, uh, I think they've got a lot of moral inventory work, because they don't want to hear stories, certain things, you know? And, uh, when you're dealing with family members, or the people, and you ask them tell it like it is, they might tell it like it is. And you might have to have your seatbelt on, or two seatbelts on, based on your frame of reference, 'cause, right? So what bothers you? Or, what happened? Uh. Well I didn't mean to be that honest, dammit. You know, I just wanted, you know, this type of thing. Because, uh, like I mentioned it yesterday, typically with combat veteran PTSD, the glass is half empty, it's not half full. So how they look at death tells me how they look at life. Now we're trained traditionally the opposite way, right? You know, look at, if you continue negative behavior, you might this or might... If you're not afraid of dying, how does that bother you? Now I'm not politically correct, so I say stuff, uh, if you haven't noticed. But, I really believe, uh, uh, dying ain't no thing, living's the bitch. It is. So they would be more inclined, so death can be a friend. Doesn't mean they would commit suicide there, but the concept of death has a different thing than most folks. Because they can relate to dying. That makes most therapists, their butt do this. You know, they get all upset with that. And so, when I do therapy groups over a series with these guys, the culmination are death groups. 'Cause we gotta go in and we gotta go down into the sewer, and, uh, you know, see what that means. 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:57:55
Do you recommend being more direct in approach with veterans? 

00:57:55
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:58:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, it depends. You might, if you have somebody, like you gotta play dentist, you know, you got, they're just sitting there looking at you, uh, you might be. But you have to be flexible and go where, where the flow is. The thing is, uh, it's still the safety, that they feel safe. You know? And one thing, if you haven't encountered this yet, is with a lot of the men, they don't want women therapists, some want women therapists, this depends. They're gonna test you if you've ever been in combat yourself. I don't think you have to, it gives you a different frame of reference. So you gotta, it's how you're comfortable in your own skin will dictate a lot of how, uh, you know, you work with them. And they can sense it, because some of these people are frequent flyers in the system. And so they come in with a system head, so they're, when they have civilians that are not a part of that system they don't always know how to do that. So, if you, just make them feel safe. 

00:59:00
How would you approach the issue of veterans not being able to discuss issues to their families due to classified information? 

00:59:00
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

00:59:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, you're, you're right. There's a lot of 'em, they, um, under penalty of cutting their arm or leg off, or something the military says that you can't do. Well, we just, you know, we share. There's certain things, if you're doing family therapy, that can't be touched. You know? So we focus on what can be touched. You know? Have some faith, uh, uh, in the spouse. There's certain things that it can. You know? So there's that confidentiality. There's the other confidentiality, if they're active military, there's no confidentiality. If you're in the VA system, a lot of times there's a therapist, there's no confidentiality, not what we'd call civilian confidentiality, right? Vet centers may be a little bit different. So, one of the things, sometimes, is they're afraid to share certain stuff, because it might get back. And so, that can be a... 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN And often times the spouse has a difficult time accepting that. 

01:00:00
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, sure they do. And also, another thing why a lot of honesty doesn't happen in the house, is, I've heard the spouses say, well, tell me what you did. And, uh, before the spouse has been burned enough, they tell him, and then they... Oh, God. I didn't really mean you'd tell me what you did. You know? Because, uh, what you have to do to survive in combat, they think you're a heathen. And you are by civilian standards, maybe. So they learn not to say anything. You know? And I forgot to say it yesterday, but, in my experience, the ultimate sin a therapist can ask a combat veteran is did you kill anybody? That's the, I hear people do it all the damn time. Unless you're hanging out at the VFW or down there where you're talking about war stories all the time, you know, in therapy, that's usually, the people that I work with, that's the ultimate sin. That destroyed the relationship right there. So I try to train folks don't ask that. They might bring up certain stuff, but you don't probe them. It's just like if you've ever worked in the prison system, you don't ask how, what all did you do to the people? You know? That's, there's certain things...now they can volunteer stuff, but you're not probing. I think that's usually, we ask questions 'cause we're curious or that's that, and that's not necessarily therapeutic. But those issues are out there. There's certain things you can't touch. You can't be totally honest about certain things, and even if you could be you'd think there might be consequences, right? And there is. 

01:01:35
UNKNOWN There are. 

01:01:35
DR. LARRY ASHLEY You know, I've been working some of the same stuff with the police and fire department. The perception is that if you say certain things in those professions, those are a weakness. That's how other people look at them, or they view themself, right? You know, the reality is if you go to your company commander or something, and you're downrange or something, say this is bothering me, he might say OK, get your ass back there, or, you know, the quit whining, or other words. You know? Or it could be a career buster. Or you could perceive it is. I've worked with some of the Army in Europe, and, you know, try to get, uh, uh, support groups going of active military. You gotta go out and tie 'em up and drag 'em in. Unless they're getting ready to retire, you might see an old, uh, senior On-Com and did his 30 years or more, could care less, he might come to the group. He'd be talking to you alone and it's supposed to be a group. Because the word, you know, the word is out. You know, the career. And then there's that unique, whole different system with the people in the National Guard and Reservists. That's a whole, 'nother world. So we see different issues. So we see the gender issues. We see developmental issues. If you're 17, that's a heck of a lot different, you know, and what have you. And with the multiple deployments, we're seeing more and more. We're seeing five, and six, and seven, or plus deployments. And, you know, your body's home, but that don't mean your brain's home. 'Cause your brain can't be home, because you don't know when you're going back. And it's not the same with all the branches of the military, not good, or bad, or ugly. But, you know, the Army is gonna give you a 12-monther for sure. Initially you were doing 16-monthers, and in the Army, you can give birth and in four months be shipped. Air Force deployments could be four or six months. Marines, four or six months. Air Force, depends, not any good. But my experience in the Army, it really gets their thing out of you. You know? So I've worked with people, and in five years, four have been downrange of the five. And they'll tell you, straight up, the Army had me go to Fort Bliss, Texas, and spend a week last May, uh, in the family advocacy program, training their therapists, and doing support, uh, and doing groups, and there were several guys getting, going back for number five, and they would smile, because they were going home. Garrison duty was a curse. They had to come home and listen to the wife say shit, and the kids. And they could relate more. Well, that head set doesn't change just because you're home and you flipped the switch. You know? That's why we've got the World War II guys that we're...there's a...VA has a group in LA that every member's in their 80s. Classic PTSD. All Korean War and World War II-plus guys. 

01:04:45
As counselors, how do we open ourselves to attract veterans seeking treatment? 

01:04:45
Larry L. Ashley Ed.S., LCADC, CPGC 

01:04:50
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Well, what you can do once you got 'em, let's put it that way, is to know as much as you can about the military culture is critical. It's very critical. One of my soapboxes and main things now is to train civilians on the military culture, 'cause it's critical. So, if you've never been in it you need to immerse yourself in the culture. Not good or bad, just know that. And so, I'm running across, I've run across therapists that worked for the military, and the VA, and they've actually, and these are seasoned, 20-plus civilian therapists, that have actually said to me with a straight face they don't understand a thing that their clients are saying. 'Cause they have no frame of reference to the acronyms, the language, the culture. So you need to immerse yourself into the culture types of things. Typically, I would guess, it depends, three to five years', full-time immersion before you can actually, you don't always have that luxury, but you need to do that. That's one of the reasons I've developed a whole course, I teach every summer, just on combat trauma for civilians. Just to have some frame of reference. And if you are a combat veteran, then that's another challenge. You know? 'Cause you can relate. That's what I call the Warrior-Therapist Phenomenon. That's what I have to face all the time, being a combat veteran from Vietnam. You know? So I tell...immerse yourself as much as you can, 'cause family issues are different in the military than... No matter how much experience you have in the civilian world, not that the civilian world's negative, but, I mean, it's a different world. You know? We all joke, but I always say, how many... in the military...raise your hand, uh, military family, and people raise...well, you've been in 12 high schools, uh, 12 schools then, right? Every year you're, it depends on the, the branch, but, you know, frequent flyer. So you have trust issues, you, you have, there's tons of issues that are different. You know? Dealing with the long term being gone. You know? You have long term deployments even for this or more, right? I know people in the submarine service, the nine-month thing is just a regular thing, all the time. You know? That's what keeps my marriage going. I'm gone nine months every twelve months. So it's, it's just a different culture, that's all I'm saying. And about 15% of people in the military now are, uh, women, and about 6% or 7% are couples. So we're seeing different roles. We're seeing fathers that take on the roles 'cause Mom's deployed. And when there's, both are deployed, they're usually in different places. And so, grandpa and grandma got a different role. It's like, almost like a foster care. So we have different issues. If you're dealing with the children you'll see different issues. Because it's hard to explain to the four and five year-old that it's for, uh, the country's under assault, or whatever we say, they know Mommy and Daddy ain't home. That's all they know, right? Abandonment. So we, we do see some, so that's important to...on that. The system always isn't available the way it should be, probably, and I'll use the example, you know, uh, that at most VA, even hospital systems doesn't have OB/GYN physicians. Women have kids. Women have other issues. You know? Lack of menstruation, or bone structure, or pregnancy, or other types of things... The military for a long time, the VA wasn't equipped to deal with those types of things. You know? Women have different stress factors jumping out of a helicopter than men do. You know? Carrying certain weight has a different physiological effect. It's not good, or bad, or ugly. It just is different. 

01:09:00
What other marriage and family issues should counselors be aware of? 

01:09:05
DR. LARRY ASHLEY Here's the un, uh, the unspoken thing that comes up a lot. Infidelity. Big deal. You know, we can say, uh, I hear this: Well, as long as they don't have feelings for them. Well, you can say, but, you know, that's, doesn't always carry a lot of weight. But, uh, you know, trust issues, you know? You're over there or here, you know, what's running around in your head, in that, and there is. Well, may the force be with you. Go do things.
