THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove. 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. With me today is Virginia Satir. We'll be talking about human potential, about becoming more fully human. Virginia is something of a living legend. She's one of the founders of family therapy, the author of People Making of Conjoint Family Therapy of making contact of your many faces and numerous other books. And she has been a role model for many people. She is the head of the Avanta Network, where she is a therapist's therapist and trains many people in the art of family therapy. She's also the person who is the subject of a book called the Structure of Magic, written by Bandler and Grinder and is… who were the two founders of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and developed that school of psychology by studying her magic. Welcome, Virginia. 

00:01:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Thank you. Nice to be here. 

00:01:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to have you here. You know, when we talk about becoming more fully human and we look at the world around us, with all of the… the problems and that… that the world faces today, especially in… in certain parts of the world that have been at war for thousands of years, one gets a sense of despair and there are certain movements in psychology the existentialists, for example, that feel a lot of despair about what is… is possible at the basic nature, perhaps, of… of the human spirit contains the almost this evil that we create about us in the… in the world. I think you have a different view than that? 

00:02:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Author, People Making When you were talking, what my mind went back to the feud between, was it the Hatfield’s and the McCoy’s? 

00:02:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Alright! And they kept their alive from generation to generation. And I heard it said that when one asked… one Hatfield and one McCoy, "What's this all about?" nobody could remember. Alright, see, I think that there's a very important piece that we have to look at, and that is that we continue to…to develop the same kinds of things that have happened to us as children. 

00:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:35
VIRGINIA SATIR And so therefore what is going on today is only a repeat of what went on with our parents and their parents before them and… and… and in an oversimplified way. What is it? But it is the looking at relationship as being an experience in dominance and submission, were… or… and we can put that negatively or positively my mean. You know, the positive view is that I'm dependent and you're gonna take care of me, okay? 

00:03:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:05
VIRGINIA SATIR The negative view is that I'm your victim and you're gonna kill me or… or… or something like that. 

00:03:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words like with child abuse, that people who have been abused as children, then when they become parents abuse their own children and that cycle may have been going on for thousands of years. 

00:03:20
VIRGINIA SATIR And that's what I see at this point in time. We've just been doing the same old thing as far as relationships are concerned, because we didn't know anything about equality. Now, what's new now, and it started after World War II, the roots came when we faced, there weren’t a lot of people who probably never experienced what was happening then, when we faced the demise of the democratic way of living, through Hitler and all of that, and when we came out of that, two things happened. One was the development of the… of the atom bomb, which we dropped and we're the only country by the way that ever did it. And the other one was the horror that came, because one man decided who should live and who should die. 

00:04:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Now that was pretty tough medicine for the world to take, and I think we're still under that shadow, by the way. 

00:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:10
VIRGINIA SATIR But being under it, we also, many, many people, never want to repeat that Hitler business again, which was the ultimate of the dominance-submission model. And no one really wants to drop bombs anymore, and in a funny way we said we'll live by killing. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:30
VIRGINIA SATIR You know. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose you could say that really there have been more human lives lost in war and revolution during the first half of the 20th century than there has been since say 1950? 

00:04:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh, I think that's true. And it was all in the interest of peace… 

00:04:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:45
VIRGINIA SATIR …trying to make the world a better place. 

00:04:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Alright! 

00:04:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Now, see, I want to take that theme, 'cos you see there are all kinds of ways that people have at trying to make the world a better place. One is to strike out all things that don't agree with you. 

00:05:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The war to end all wars. 

00:05:00
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right. 

00:05:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:00
VIRGINIA SATIR But we have this in… in people. I mean, if they say, "Whoever doesn't agree with me, let's get rid of 'em." Okay! Then there are the people who say that we need to be able to evolve everybody so that they can be owners of their own decisions and they can make their own decisions. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:20
VIRGINIA SATIR And this idea, you see is very interesting, because this idea depends upon the fact that we believe that human beings are natural… naturally are growth oriented. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:30
VIRGINIA SATIR That they're not… they're not bent on destruction. See, we entered the world along time ago with the idea that people were bent on destruction, therefore we had to keep them from destroying themselves. I don't believe that for one minute. 

00:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That sort of a 17th century view of Hobbes and the social contract… 

00:05:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah! 

00:05:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …Leviathan that there's this monster inside of us, in human nature, and the purpose of society is to constrain this… this monstrous side of ourselves. 

00:05:55
VIRGINIA SATIR So that works as… makes us work on deprivation and limitation. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:55
VIRGINIA SATIR And so as a result the wonderful things that people have inside themselves never get a chance to see the light of day. And so what we are doing, we're being very costly when we follow those same principles in keeping down the uniqueness, the creativity that's possible, because people find themselves feeling, not comfortable, it's not the word, familiar with… with this… what's going on. And if it's familiar, they don't wanna change it, because they feel, "Well, I'm going into the unknown, what's going to happen then?" Now, at this point in time, enough has happened and I mentioned the two things about the Nazi business and the… and the nuclear power. 

00:06:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:06:35
VIRGINIA SATIR That wou… many people are willing now to look at something different, to look at the possibilities that we can have different relationships with each other. 

00:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:45
VIRGINIA SATIR And it's now all around, it's true in religion, it's true in business, it's true in almost all kinds of… of places that have to do with human beings at this point. So we're right in the middle of something. 

00:07:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And that people are willing to look inside of themselves once again and… and say you know, "We're not all monstrous." 

00:07:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes! 

00:07:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:05
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right! And, you know what's so interesting is, see I go around this world all the time. I go into all places and I find a same thing everywhere, fear of the unknown. And then, when people have some kind of beginning idea that they're not so terrible, people are really quite nice, and they find that out, then there was fears that they had about going into the unknown is… 

00:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:30
VIRGINIA SATIR …somehow disappear. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE People are more willing to trust the unknown? 

00:07:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah! Do you know what may… what makes it possible for me to trust the unknown? 

00:07:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No! 

00:07:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Because I got eyes, ears, skin. I can talk, I can move, I can feel, and I can think. And that's not gonna change when I go into a new context. 

00:07:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:50
VIRGINIA SATIR I've got that. And then I give myself permission to say, all my real yeses and no's, because I've got all those… all those other possibilities. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:00
VIRGINIA SATIR And then I can move anywhere. 

00:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Why not? 

00:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, you trust your own integrity, you trust your own resources to carry you through new situations? 

00:08:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes, because all I need are what I showed you. Those abilities to see and hear and think, feel, and touch, and to… to move and speak. 

00:08:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… And ultimately, I… I suppose it's your ability to feel what you feel, to say what you feel, to be real about that is… is what can keep you going in almost the most difficult of situations. 

00:08:30
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, for me it is. 

00:08:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:08:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Because that means I never have to say I know when I don't know. 

00:08:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:35
VIRGINIA SATIR I never have to say yes when I feel no. I never have to say no when I feel yes. So that I… I can keep all my energy in one place and that makes it possible for me to be the most effective in coping. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… And in a sense, you know, when… when a person can live with that level of authenticity, I… I suppose there's no existential dilemma or… or confrontation with death or… or with terror with the unknown that you somehow don't have the inner strength to… to handle. 

00:09:10
VIRGINIA SATIR You know, I don't know if this is exactly in the point, but it's something I'd like to share with you. The idea that the event is never that which determines your fate, it's your coping of the event. 

00:09:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Death, sickness, all kinds of things happen to human beings and the fate of what happens as a result is in the coping. I… I know a lot of people who say, "Well, if you lived right, you wouldn't have those things to cope with." I don't think we know enough about that, how we can avoid things, and I don't think avoiding things is helpful anyway. But we… But it's the coping with these things that give us the kind of strength, and… and gives us our opportunities. So death is something to cope with. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:09:55
VIRGINIA SATIR We all are gonna die one day. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… And… And you also point out quite a bit that we all have weaknesses, we're all imperfect, none of us can see our own back. 

00:10:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Right, exactly! This is important to remember too, because the peace, how I look at reality. 

00:10:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:10
VIRGINIA SATIR No, I'll put… I'll change that. How… What I think a reality is, is what I see. Okay. What I see is not the total reality, and here's where the back comes in. You've got a back, and everybody's got a back, but how many people have seen it? Lot of other people see your back, but you don't see it. 

00:10:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So we always have the unknown just right… right behind us. 

00:10:30
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right! And that's… See, when I… when you start putting things together like that, Jeff, then you begin to get an awareness of the absurdity of thinking that all there is in the world is what you see in it. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Would you focus quite a lot in your lifetime on human potential, on dealing with people who come, you know, from tormented families, where… where… where there was abuse, where the parents didn't get along with each other? These are the kind of situations that I suppose socially we… we tend to blame on as worse social problems, drugs and… and crime and… and you feel very hopeful that a person's life need not be conditioned by their past in this regard? 

00:11:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, it's not only a matter of my feeling, but I've demonstrated that. 

00:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Now, let me give you a little metaphor. Let's think that the human being has countless number of little jets, that there's a fountain inside that has countless number of jets and if our energy were free to flow then these jets were all open. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:30
VIRGINIA SATIR That this would just put in fantastic energy. But most of these or many of these jets are closed, that we shouldn't do this, and we shouldn't do that, and who's gonna hate us if we do this and that and something else. So as a result, we… we live half lives. Now, when… 

00:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When you say it sounds like they're closed, because of our own sort of mental chatter? 

00:11:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly, exactly! What… There all the rules about what we shouldn't do. 

00:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:55
VIRGINIA SATIR When we open those up, you know… you know what happens to a fountain where only some of the jets will… will let water come out? 

00:12:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:12:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Sometimes the water comes out in big gushes in some of them. 

00:12:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:05
VIRGINIA SATIR And… And it's very uneven. 

00:12:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right! 

00:12:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Because the central pressure to make the water come out is stopped by the holes that are stopped. 

00:12:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Okay. And I believe that's our central place inside of us with the energy. 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:20
VIRGINIA SATIR So opening up all of these holes, so to speak, which are our feelings and our… our possibilities. And then when we allow that to happen, then we become in a totally different place, because we then can have harmony moving and we have the total force of the energy that's possible. And that's all I've done with people, is open up. 

00:12:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Help people get really in touch with their feelings again. 

00:12:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Their feelings and allow themselves to remember that their feelings are not that… that the parts of them that decide what should happen. Feelings are like a temperature… a thermometer which says what things are. You move over to another part of yourself when you make decisions. 

00:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:00
VIRGINIA SATIR But a lot of people have said if you… if you go into your feelings, that's gonna be the basis of your decisions. 

00:13:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You're gonna make a bad decision then, so stop, cut off your feelings completely. 

00:13:10
VIRGINIA SATIR And so what is the important thing is that our feelings are like the juice that keeps us in a whole piece and gives us the ability to see better, to think better, to feel better, the owned emotions. 

00:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:20
VIRGINIA SATIR But an emotion that you have which isn't owned, you say, "No, I don't have it", is one that splits your energy, because it puts you into this kind of thing. You cannot say that you aren't what you are. Now, what I mean is yes, you can say that, but that doesn't change it. 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:35
VIRGINIA SATIR If you're angry for instance, and you'd say, "Oh no, I'm not angry," or you're feeling very excited about something you say, "No, I not excited, ah." See, those are the kinds of emotional lies that… that just steal our energy away. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In… In our culture it seems as if females are… are brought up to be more in touch with their feelings. And I often run into many women who… who seem to have a lot of feeling and then they complain about their spouses and say, you know, "He's so out of touch, he won't admit to his feelings." Do you think that's in general a more of a problem for men? 

00:14:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes! Now, let me just say something, because I wanna tell you. I give an award which is called the Reward for Renovated Super-Reasonable Men. Okay! Now what that means is, these beautiful guys, and there are plenty of them around, who had been schooled to be brave, to not let their feelings sway them, and they've got a kind of a shield around them, and many of them develop their left brain and their right brain is lying fellow. Now, okay! So what I do is I know that that's what a man is supposed to "not put ears" but that's what he supposed to be like. 

00:14:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They're role models for men. 

00:14:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Role models, that's right! And they're never supposed to respond and feeling and all that. And of course our men die much earlier than women, we already know that. 

00:14:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah that's a great tragedy, I suppose. 

00:14:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Sure! So I've developed the concept of half wit. I wanna tell you about that one. Women were supposed to never have any strong aggressive feelings or their left brains, they weren't supposed to be smart. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:15:10
VIRGINIA SATIR The men weren't supposed to be soft, they were only supposed to be hard, you should excuse the expression. And so what we had when a couple got together, what I say is each one had their half wit. 

00:15:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Yes, you often have this image of the very strong man out of touch with his warm feelings, and… and the woman who maybe is more in touch with her feelings, but on the other hand she tends to be silly and… and it rather than come from her own strength. 

00:15:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, see, this is one of the things that the role modeling has done. 

00:15:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:15:40
VIRGINIA SATIR If you're a man, this is how you should be, if you're a woman, this is how you should be. So both suffer. Now, the woman wants… and often I've heard this over and over again to her husband, "Can't you be with my feelings?" And isn't that he can't, but he's got rules that he shouldn't. Okay. On the other hand, he would like to very often have an intellectual companion, and then he complains that he doesn't have it. 

00:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:16:05
VIRGINIA SATIR He… He doesn't have that. So, what we're in the process of, for the first time in the world, is each person has to be whole within themselves. They have to have their hard part and their soft part, or put another way, their cognitive… cognitive part and their intuitive part. Both of them have to have it, so that neither one has to bootleg the other part from the other person. See, that's what a lot of the marital problems are about. 

00:16:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! A lot of people seem to understand what you're saying intellectually, but then they say, "I… but I just can't do it. You know, whenever I… I get into a tough situation, all of my old sides, my old tapes come out." And… And short of psychotherapy, what… what can people do? 

00:16:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, I… I'm glad you raised that question, because there are a lot of people that wanna change, okay. 

00:16:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:50
VIRGINIA SATIR I wanna relate this and… and look at it as a habit. 

00:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Okay! Now, what do we do with habits? First of all, we give ourselves a message. Do we wanna change this habit? 

00:17:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:17:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Alright! Now, if we wanna change it, if I was… 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE For(ph) motivated, yeah. 

00:17:05
VIRGINIA SATIR I wanna change it, then I'm gonna stop thinking I'm gonna do it for so and so or so and so, I'm doing it because it's for my health or for whatever I want. So I decide that I will… I'm gonna change it. 

00:17:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Now, when we change anything that's been ongoing, we have the strong temptation to go with what's familiar. Remember, this is not the comfortable. 

00:17:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:17:25
VIRGINIA SATIR But the familiar. 

00:17:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:17:30
VIRGINIA SATIR And so, we have take a step here and then the familiar brings us back. 

00:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:30
VIRGINIA SATIR And this is a fight that we have. It's just like dieting or getting up smoking or any of the things. But if you have given yourself a commitment, and you are doing it for yourself, then you know, like any other habit, you gotta backslide and you're going to go ahead, and finally you're going to be able to make it. See a lot of people don't realize that change, changing oneself is one of the hardest things in the world to do. And you know, the person who thinks you… you could change easily is the one who's already been through the change process. 

00:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:05
VIRGINIA SATIR You know, all the people who are smoking and say, "I've stopped, you can stop." 

00:18:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:18:10
VIRGINIA SATIR So, the big part of all of this is is that this is not easy to do, changing what we've been characteristically and doing and familiar with. 

00:18:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:18:20
VIRGINIA SATIR Because the… the pull of that is very strong. 

00:18:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And yet you are optimistic? 

00:18:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh sure, because I know that people can be with their desires. 

00:18:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:18:30
VIRGINIA SATIR I don't think that people have to… have to lose in the game of… of… of life. 

00:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, is it a question of just forcing themselves through the difficulty or? 

00:18:40
VIRGINIA SATIR No! Let me tell you something, a… a typical thing, I go through a whole series of changes with people, and then they say, "Well, what if it doesn't last?" I said, "I don't know whether it's gonna last or not, but let me say something, if at a moment in time you find yourself doing what you've always been doing, then you can give yourself an A grade for being aware." 

00:18:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:00
VIRGINIA SATIR "Then you can make a choice. Do I wanna continue this or not?" 

00:19:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, not to berate yourself if you relapse. 

00:19:05
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right! 

00:19:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:19:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Because it's very… the… the pulls are powerful. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:19:10
VIRGINIA SATIR So what will be the first step, and I always say give yourself a gold star for recognizing it. I remember somebody who wanted to stop blaming and he had a very highly developed skill for blaming, blamed on everybody. 

00:19:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Many people are talented at that. 

00:19:20
VIRGINIA SATIR And so this person decided, "I don't wanna do that." And… And the reason? They knew that it was hard on their blood pressure, it was hard on their innards, it was hard on their people outside, and they didn't wanna do it. So, the first step, that was very clear. But now they had to put that awareness were at the time that's was happening. So the first time that this person said, "Ah! I hear, I know what I'm doing," and stopped in the middle of a blame. 

00:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Just like that? 

00:19:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Like that. 

00:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:19:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Now, that's the first step. 

00:19:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:19:50
VIRGINIA SATIR To recognize that. It doesn't mean it's not gonna happen again. But then, it was like this is now conscious. 

00:19:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:55
VIRGINIA SATIR And now you can say, "Do I wanna do this some more or do I not?" 

00:20:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:20:00
VIRGINIA SATIR So that the first step is that. Now, that's where the commitment, the feeling of the self come together with the awareness. 

00:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:05
VIRGINIA SATIR Because as long as you're not aware of anything you're not gonna change anything and then to be patient with yourself, so that then the next time you… it'll come a little clo… a little faster. 

00:20:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:20
VIRGINIA SATIR And at of after a while you'll have built up enough experience for the non-blaming stance that the pull of the blaming one is no longer there. 

00:20:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sounds ultimately as if in this case one has to stop blaming oneself in order to stop blaming others. Ah…ah… 

00:20:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Absolutely, because what difference is it? 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… And let the certain part of us, I guess the part you might call the will power, function harmoniously with all the other parts. 

00:20:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And then the will can become stronger. 

00:20:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes! That's… That's as a very important point. Will cannot do anything… 

00:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:55
VIRGINIA SATIR …without awareness. But then will is… will… I mean, Dr. Assagioli(ph) talked a lot about this in psychosynthesis. Will becomes like the captain of our ship. What do we will ourselves to do? What… What kind of decisions do we wanna take? And then we can look at the things that come in to start to take us off our decision track, whatever it is. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:15
VIRGINIA SATIR And it's not any different from that… mean that dialogue that goes inside, "I wanna do this, but oh I… now I'm getting all of this flak from myself", as compared to two people. Same thing. 

00:21:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:30
VIRGINIA SATIR So, you see, a lot of people also are afraid to… to take plunges into the unknown. This is one of the things, I mentioned this before. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:21:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Because in the unknown I'll be naked. And I say, "Not any more naked than you are now." Really! 

00:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:21:50
VIRGINIA SATIR So, anyway, the literature is full of anecdotes of people who were afraid to move somewhere, and would rather… It looks like they would rather, it isn't really true, it's the pull of familiar… familiarity would rather be still the abused person in this victimizing situation, then… because at least they knew about it. 

00:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose the hopeful thought(ph) sign is that when you look at the people who have overcome a bad background or overcome an addiction that all of these people once felt that way too. 

00:22:20
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right! And this is a very important thing. We have thousands of people like this. 

00:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Just thousands of people who have moved from what I call one status quo to another. The one status quo embodied the bad habit, the drinking or the… or the drugs or… or whatever it was, the… the abuse, to another status quo where life brings joy and doesn't have to do this. In between those two stages… 

00:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:45
VIRGINIA SATIR …is a lot of work. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:50
VIRGINIA SATIR But you know where you started and I was… I say to people, "Bow three times in the mirror in the morning when you get up, and each time you bow you say the world is a better place because I am here and finally you will get to believe it. Then you will let yourself know that were… you can be kind, you can be fun to be around, and you can be confident." 

00:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Now, it's interesting, 'cos we have been focusing a lot on the individual, and I know really the large thrust of your work is that change occurs in groups of people, and families and in communities. Perhaps we should address that a little bit. 

00:23:20
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, see, I wanna say something that may sound strange to you. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:23:20
VIRGINIA SATIR Literally there is no such thing as a group. There are only a lot of individuals whose decisions… 

00:23:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:30
VIRGINIA SATIR …get made to form a group, okay? 

00:23:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:23:35
VIRGINIA SATIR So that I… I think this is very important. 

00:23:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Groups are kind of like fictions in a way. 

00:23:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, they're there and you have to deal with them. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:40
VIRGINIA SATIR But the… the kinds of decisions that groups are make… are made out of the rules that get developed in that system. 

00:23:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:50
VIRGINIA SATIR They do not represent the… as a whole, anything except the rules in the system. 

00:23:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:55
VIRGINIA SATIR So, it's like I found that out when I was working with families and so one of the things I do is try to find the rules to free people, individuals, to be able to do what the rules do not allow. 

00:24:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You seem to be pretty big on breaking rules? 

00:24:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, I will tell you, I think most of our emotional rules have to be broken. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Like, "I should never get angry at somebody I love." 

00:24:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:24:15
VIRGINIA SATIR You realize what a… what a difficult thing that is. Or, "I should always be perfect." How about that one? Or, "I must never show fear." You know that one? 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I… Well, I share all of those. 

00:24:30
VIRGINIA SATIR And you see those rules have to be broken. 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:24:30
VIRGINIA SATIR Because they are inhuman rules that can never be lived up to. 

00:24:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Right! I… I agree with that and then I also have to accept that… that I can be a perfectionist too and not fault myself for that. 

00:24:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, what… whatever rule you're following… 

00:24:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:45
VIRGINIA SATIR …if it doesn't fit the harmony of your body and the harmony of the universe, it's gonna give you trouble. 

00:24:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:24:55
VIRGINIA SATIR And so this is one of the things. And may be these are one… this… these are steps to what is now called transcendental work or transformational work, is to recognize. 

00:25:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:00
VIRGINIA SATIR When we're sick, we're out of harmony with our self. When… And also at the same time we're out of harmony with the universe. Now when I talk like that to people, every once in a while some people get a little scared, but more people understand it now than ever before. 

00:25:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… So in other words, what you're saying here is that we can start with in… in sort of the… the… the nuts and bolts of… of what we're doing and… and trying it through that, but also learn from it so… so that if… if I discover that I'm sick, I don't have to feel bad. I can say, "Oh, I've learned something about myself." 

00:25:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah! 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:25:35
VIRGINIA SATIR And that's very important. See, and the ongoing problem with some of the physicians today, and generally speaking, is that when people get sick that you give them so many drugs that they don't know what's going on, so you never discover the sickness. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:50
VIRGINIA SATIR The cause of it… And you see, in what we're riding between is good physicians don't want their patients to have too much pain. 

00:25:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:25:55
VIRGINIA SATIR So the drugs will kill the pain, but at the same time they also often times banish the opportunity to see what the pain means. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:26:05
VIRGINIA SATIR And people like Norman Shealy… Dr. Norman Shealy, who runs a pain rehabilitation clinic, he's now in Missouri, talked about, "Pain is a messenger that we need to look at." And he doesn't want people to have more pain than necessary, but when we start looking at the pain as a messenger, we get to a different place and… 

00:26:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:26:25
VIRGINIA SATIR And maybe we can also use things like meditation and so on. I'm not against any using any good medical procedures. I think medicine has done a wonderful thing. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But the physical pain and the emotional pain, I suppose, are all like guideposts for us. 

00:26:40
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right, exactly! 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We can take a look and say, "Well, what are we… where do we need to correct?" 

00:26:45
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right! 

00:26:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:26:45
VIRGINIA SATIR And so… So again, you know when… when you think about it, how can I help this person to be able to be in a good enough state so they can begin to look at the meaning of their own pain, and the meaning of… of… of the messages that this pain is sending? 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! Virginia, we're out of time now, but I… I want you to know this has been a very enlightening half an hour for me. We've been dealing with really some difficult issues, how we can break through some of the real tough spots in our life, and your message has been quite optimistic. Thank you very much for being with me. 

00:27:25
VIRGINIA SATIR You're welcome. 

00:27:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.
