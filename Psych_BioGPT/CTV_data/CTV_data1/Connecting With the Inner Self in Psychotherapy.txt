BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN  Okay, good morning everybody. Welcome, and Marilynn(ph), I’d like to introduce Marilynn and welcome into my office, travelling across -- yeah look, crowded. 

00:00:15
MARILYNN So crowded. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN You mean those people all the way over there, they seem so far away. So, uhm, we’re gonna do a piece of work that I hope will be very, very deeply therapeutic, and I mentioned before that it might take two, three, up to five minutes to get past any self-consciousness, so you might enjoy it while it lasts. And just as a -- as an, ah, overview, we’ve never worked together before. 

00:01:00
MARILYNN No. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN And you approached me a couple of days ago and just, uhm, volunteered to be the client and we talked just very, ah, slightly about what it is that you -- where it is that you want to get to. Uhm, so I just want to set that as a context and anything else that you would like to share at the outset before we step into the work proper? 

00:01:35
MARILYNN No, not right now. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN  Okay, good. So, what I’m gonna suggest is that we start with this, something that I -- I often find helpful which is just a couple of minute preparation, and I’d like to ask both of us to close our eyes and just begin with a little attunement settling in, settling down and to begin to claim the space as a sanctuary, to begin to claim and open the space as a safe haven, so that there is a nice generous space that holds and supports each of us and both of us together, so that any thought that wants to come or wants to leave, any images, any presences that in the service of your growth and your transformation want to join us today, may they be welcomed within this place of sanctuary and one of the nice things that each of us can do is be able to appreciate that base underneath thinking or history, that’s a very nice thing to know. And there is a base that’s underneath it. It’s breathing on its own, sensing on its own, transforming on its own. And so may we rest, continue to deepen --. 

00:04:20
[sil.] 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Our awareness with that place. And from that place, I like to simply suggest that we both invite intention or set an intention. In the simplest words what is that that you most want to experience today? What are your deepest values? 

00:05:00
MARILYNN  I want to feel at home with myself. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Good, that’s good. Let’s take a moment with that and realize that statement has so many different levels. That’s nice here that we can take advantage of each of them. You want to feel at home. It’s a nice thing that home is already here. It’s an appreciation of the different things that need to be released, let go, connected with, to realize where you already are, at home. 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN And then finally I’d just like to invite you to invite any resources, any presences, any beings, any experiences that you know can help you claim this experience of being at home. So nice to sense they are already here. So nice to sense that in this time past and present and future are all here with us. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN And then when you're ready you can open your eyes come on back out. 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Oh! You have so much intelligence in your body and so it’s a pleasure to get to know that with you. I can just imagine how terrible it would be to live away from that intelligence, it seems so deep. I can (inaudible ) but I'm sure you’ve been told that before. So, anything you want to note about that -- that first round, what was there for you? 

00:07:55
MARILYNN Uhm, I experienced a sense of home on my -- next to her neighbor who's eighth, comes and visits and she's a Down syndrome's child and I think --. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Her name is Heith? 

00:08:10
MARILYNN Cleo. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Cleo. 

00:08:10
MARILYNN And I’ve been with Cleo since the day she was born. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN  Uhm. 

00:08:15
MARILYNN So, my image is we sit in my couch and she -- she sits next to me and puts her arm around me or --. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:20
MARILYNN Makes me put my arm around her and that’s home. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Yes, so I’d like to thank the spirit of Cleo for joining us today. Hi Cleo. 

00:08:30
MARILYNN True. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN And I am sure there will be other Anam Cara. You know that term? 

00:08:40
MARILYNN Umm, hmm. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN And for the people all the way and over there, Anam Cara means friends of the soul. 

00:08:45
MARILYNN Umm, hmm. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN  Friends of the soul. So, especially because it seems that your first wisdom, your first knowing is deep inside of your body, I’m going to suggest that maybe it would be helpful to lift the body and mind, be able to lead us and teach us and guide us on this healing journey today. Does it sound like a good idea? 

00:09:25
MARILYNN Umm, hmm. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN So the goal that you emphasize, I want to be at home, uhm, I -- I feel that very resonant like when you say that. It’s like it -- it really vibrates, as I said, on many levels. So that would be the -- the first statement, I want to be at home and then we had a complement, but, uhm, I end up feeling or experiencing --. 

00:10:00
MARILYNN Disconnected. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Disconnected. Great. 

00:10:00
MARILYNN Scattered. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN So this experience of being at home, I’d like to welcome that and there's an experience of disconnection and it's being scattered and I would like to equally, equally welcome that because I am sure that that part makes a lot of sense, and that is bringing something very, very important in terms of this deepening sense of being at home of course that might sound a little doubtful at first glance, what possible value could there be in this movement towards disconnectedness, but I am wondering if we can do a little experiment in terms of -- of what the relationship to those might be and what might happen if they were actually able to support each other rather than oppose each other so to speak. Sound okay? So, I am going to ask you to -- which one do you think would be more helpful to start with? 

00:11:40
MARILYNN Disconnection. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Great, okay. So, I am gonna ask you to just feel into your body and let your body show me with a movement, with a posture what would be a nice symbolic representation of this experiential pattern of disconnection. So I keep going back to -- great, okay; and then you can come back up. Did you know that but? 

00:12:20
MARILYNN Umm, hmm. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN  So that just came to you. 

00:12:25
MARILYNN Surprised me. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Surprised you. 

00:12:25
MARILYNN  So I would feel try to scatter my, you know, pull myself apart but I can’t do that. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Alright, alright. There's something that you said that this movement really, really important. 

00:12:40
MARILYNN That’s shutting down, being closed in. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Closed in. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 

00:12:45
MARILYNN For me it feels bad because it’s the disconnection that I struggle with. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Umm, hmm. And this second part, which is I want to feel at home, can you just attune in and just notice and sense what particular movement or posture represents that. Great. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN Is there anything more that goes with that? 

00:13:25
MARILYNN No just --. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN That’s it, okay. So what I’d like to suggest is that we do a little trance work, uhm, but not necessarily traditional standardized western trance, we'll have a number of elements of that. Uhm, I am going to Bali after Christmas, I’m looking forward to that. And I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the Balinese trance dances. They are -- they are most incredible things, it will be my second trip. But all of their trances are done with archetypal body postures and movements and they are really deep sort of cataleptic but graceful, uhm, expressions you got to see trance in Africa of course it’s -- it’s a different type of trance also a little bit more intense typically, but the Asian trance has a beautiful sweetness to it and a beautiful grace, so I am going to suggest that we use this as the base is the movement, uhm, between these two, uhm, postures and we’re going to -- I am gonna ask you to treat them as sort of one complementary movement and just to do it as an experiment of curiosity with a sense of anything that your body insists on doing and all efforts to change it have failed. Maybe it can be helpful to say what’s my body trying to bring to me. What gift is my body trying to bring into me and I don’t consciously understand it, but I'm -- I'm willing in a safe place to become curious. So what I am going to ask you to do is go through those and then if it’s okay with you, I’ll sort of weave some verbal suggestions through that as a way of supporting it and just inviting a way of opening from that place, so that you can move it and find what it is as a healing or transformational movement. 

00:15:50
MARILYNN Okay. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Okay, so the first -- before we do it in any sort of full trance, I’m just gonna ask you do it without -- without trance just as a way of just, uhm, observing, going from this to this, and just like to, you can do with your eyes open or closed. Probably easier to do with your eyes closed and just do two or three rounds, something in you is needing to do that and that note just slow it down to at least thirty times that slowness. Something in you, very importantly needing to do that, that’s it. Something in you also longs -- needs to do that. And something in you really needs to do that who really knows what your unconscious mind is trying to teach you. Something is emphasizing, coming back to your heart. Also important when you come there you can take a breath, a sort of release from that. Notice any awarenesses that you had. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN And then come on back out here. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN So any -- anything you’d like to mention about that? 

00:17:55
MARILYNN  When I was down here I felt alone and it felt cold and when I came up here I felt connected and warmth. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. And do you have any sense of what it would mean if there was warmth beginning to develop in that posture? 

00:18:20
MARILYNN Not right now. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN So that’s where trance I think really can be very helpful. It allow us to be able to tap into some of the different experiential dimensions, of some basic experiential pattern like -- like this. What we’re looking to do in trance you see what if we added centering, what if we added warmth, what if we added a gentle grace, what if we did it with a slow sensual rhythm, what would it be then? So that’s -- it’s just sort of a way of thinking about what a resource trance can be. It can -- it can bring to a very connected level, something we have been in a disconnected way and in a way open up a whole new set of experiential understandings and relationships about what is your body mind insisting on doing when it does this. So -- so this time I am gonna just do a little trance induction and then I’m gonna ask you to go back through. But to make your connection with yourself, more important than the movement itself. To make the connection with yourself to your center, to your grace, more important than the movement itself so that you can be able -- from a deep place, become curious about the movement and so as you close your eyes and just begin that process, there's something that you really are here to learn today. And in order to allow that learning in a warm connected relief, you can begin first the process of letting the nice sense of warm relaxation from the home, I appreciated as you settled in. Your breathing can begin to be not your breathing, you’re not your breathing, breathing is there are all on its own, what a pleasure to receive breathing. You are not your breathing, it doesn’t belong to you. That’s a nice gift to release attachment, you are not your body, and your body can be experienced as without weight, beautiful sense of a weightless body. Even your mind, you are not your mind, beautiful sense of a weightless mind, a mind without any weight at all. In that process, it’s nice to be able -- that feeling of I am not that, not that, not that I am, I am, I am. And from that place you can sense if you were to speak, if you were to walk, you were to think from your deepest center before thought, a place where you are most viewed, you can really take the time to begin to sense your center, everything around it your thoughts, your body, your mental history, all can begin -- become more fluid as you shift a sense to that center. I am going to ask you to allow movement to occur, those same movements. I am gonna ask you to give your first attention to that center so that if in any way you lose the center you'd slow down or let go the movement temporarily, so you can honor your center and each and every expression. So the movement that goes down, the movement that comes in and be able to organize around the home of your center. And so when you're ready I am going to ask you this time letting your body move even slower. It’s not a race won by the swift and begin that slow, that’s it, graceful, hypnotic movement and that each sensual moment it can be able to open warmth, light, awareness, reaching, center, organizing center, a beautiful ancient dance, feeling that’s it, so as the hands come, that’s it slower like eating a French meal could take five hours, with a sensual intelligence, an ancient dance it’s not yours, it started thousands of years ago and now it’s coming through your, the creation of a self, the creation of human. Being relax in your face, breathing in, that’s good. And as you go all the way to that point, you feel at some point the opposite complimentary movement that begins to unfold something in you -- is in a dance of creation. Relaxing your forehead, relaxing your whole body without weight. Curious, your body has its own intelligent, going down through the ages, mothers, grandmothers, great, great, great grandmothers. Children still to come this dance, a beautiful dance, a beautiful dance. Relaxing through your shoulders. A beautiful sense of warmth and connection to allow you to feel this is what needs to happen at a deep level and the feel, but it’s not enough, it needs to be connected to something else that balances it, that completes it, that makes it whole relaxing your mind. Nothing to cling to, nothing to do except weightless body doing an ancient dance of creation, death and rebirth. Death, rebirth. It always starts and ends with a return to the center. That deep feeling of connection. That’s good, release, release, release. And then feeling the next round something, the dance, death and rebirth and feeling which part letting go, releasing. And the movement of where it opens and releases in space, isn’t that amazing? And feeling that sense of warmth as the dance begins to shift as you feel in the shifting trends, formation, that’s good. A death, release, something to let go deeply into the ground, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, seeds for the future. And beautiful sands are picking up, pieces. Finding that journey in that release, for what it is that's coming back to you now. Something coming back to you and beautiful sands, that’s good. All the way from above down through the crown, through the third-eye, through the throat, clearly into the heart. Beautiful sense, your body knows, your body knows, your body knows, your body knows, your body knows how to move through and there's any further releasing, any further letting down, coming all the way releasing, beautiful sense, it could be a hundred years ago, drums, rhythms, could be a hundred years. This is not now, it’s always a beautiful dance deep within that’s moving, sensing, the dance of death and rebirth, releasing, going down. I said to my soul to be still and wait. Let this darkness come upon you, which is the darkness of God. And then lifting, slowing, abnormally slow, sometimes it feels like your body isn’t really moving, although it really is moving, opening, reaching the stars or my ceiling, the stars illuminate, the stars connect me bringing, receiving, coming together, beautiful scent, a feeling that coming together that extends like light extending through in a coherent wavelength like a laser, this is what we pray for. This is what brings us in that place of returning back to the center. And the poet David Whyte says I do not know, I want to write about faith, but I have no faith myself I refuse it even the smallest entry. Let this then, my small poem -- that’s good. Let this then by small dance to the moon, and the sun, and the stars, to the earth, to the dead, to what needs to be released. Let this then, a small dance like a new moon, slender and barely open, be the first prayer that opens to faith. Your body knows, you’re moving -- that’s good, and just let it happen. Something with cleo and all of the friends, Anam Cara reminding you this is the dance of trance formation. In all of the conditions, everything that needs to be released, to be held, to be gently brought down to the earth again, brought down to the moistness, brought down to the warmth, brought down to the release that allows you to gather up whatever it is, your body mind, you create yourself most needs, trusting, listening, learning discovering, or hazing. All of that sands are beautiful, all your pose relaxed. It allows to be at home. The strength, the resilience, the gentleness. This is what we pray for. This is what the body knows. This is the sense of deep connection, to the light and the dark of God. Beautiful sands of the home in the heart. You can relax your face, nothing to cling to in the mind. It’s already happening. And from that place you can begin to sense, different flashes forward into the future, different movements, dance -- Oh! Yes. This basic movement will happen while we raise our hands as we when we were children back into the world to say “I’m here”, and the energy of the warmth that comes with that lifting sense "I’m here", through the heart, through the belly, through the pelvis, all the way down through the feet, into the earth where all is released. Something that's just needed, wanted it’s time to let go. Time to honor death, what no longer is part of the living and so I said to my soul, be still and wait, let this darkness be the darkness of God. Not yet time for love of, not yet time for faith and yet hope and faith and love, all begin to come back and lift it out off the darkness, lift it out as above so below. And it's a beautiful technique in the martial art of Aikido, Tenchi Nage. The movement that unites heaven and earth. Tenchi, the movement from the center that unites heaven and earth, the light and the dark. A beautiful sense of being at home to watch it transmogrification, translator, transform, form, formation of a future, transform, form -- that's it, that’s good, that’s really good, that’s really good. Let your body new as a time for release, as a time for letting it know settle deeply in all of the different dimensions, up and down, in and out, loss and reconnection, disconnection that leads to reconnections. All in, healing trance. You can allow yourself to find one more round and curious what the body most does now to express the integration. What the body most does now that allows the integration to translate into movement and image? A post-hypnotic suggestion, a dance of the one side, Tenchi Nage, Tenchi’s Nage. Beautiful sense of moving down or lifting up, moving down or lifting up. 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN A reversal of fortune, so that on the another hand you could move down as you lift up, it’s a beautiful mandala and begins to be created like a beautiful ritual close, beautiful kimono, a beautiful white gown, a beautiful dress for purification, a beautiful return to the place which you'll begin. And know it for the first time that you can do all the integration taking another minute or so, beginning now. 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN That’s good. That’s beautiful. That’s really beautiful. Really sensing, what your deepest healing intelligence is, you can trust your body, you can trust the gifts, the wisdom in your body, it’s a wonderful thing to learn. And then whenever you need to learn something, you can always return to this place and allow yourself to that whatever has been repeating itself. To repeat itself with a beautiful sensual, rhythmic grace which is your first spiritual language. That’s wonderful. And from that place, any simple vows, any simple promises, any simple commitment about the values in your life that you most want to live no matter what. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN About the values in your life that you’re most want to honor and enjoy. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN You can feel free to make that commitment. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN And come what will, a deep sense of what your life really is about. Can continue to guide you, nourish you, teach you and calm you. 

00:48:45
[sil.] 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN I’ll take a few more moment as to with any sense of completion that you need. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN And at some point you can remember that in the outer world, we’ve been sitting in a big room, and it's so nice to know that you can be able to forget that and then also to remembering in a comfort to go away. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN That allows you the process to comfortably begin to bring a nice closure into that, anything tender that needs a gentle wrapping, a human wrapping of honor and dignity that can be wrapped gently. And given an honored place where its trembling beauty can be protected and honored through that human wrapping. 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:51:05
MARILYNN Oh. Where was I? 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN You were at home at your alibi. I was at home the whole time judge. 

00:51:15
MARILYNN I like being there. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Umm, hmm. 

00:51:20
MARILYNN Well, that was intense, a beautiful intense. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN You look beautiful. 

00:51:25
MARILYNN Thank you. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN You -- you really look beautiful. I hope you can see what I see, what I'm just mirroring back to you. That’s who you really are, that’s who you really are. 

00:51:40
MARILYNN Thank you. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN So, I want to thank you for, uhm, for, uhm, having the courage and the commitment to come up here and to help in our collective learning process and to be able to help yourself to get to where you really need to be in your life. I -- I wish you all -- all the very best. 

00:52:10
MARILYNN Thank you very much. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN You are welcome. That’s it. 

00:52:15
