SUMIE OKAZAKI  Thank you, Dr. Yao, for a nice, ah, introduction. Ah, can you all hear me? Yes? Okay. Great. Uhm, so, uhm, first, I'd like to thank Dr. Constantine and, ah, the organizers at the Roundtable, ah, for giving me the opportunity to just kinda take a step back and really look at where Asian American Psychology is and have a, ah, chance to kinda review the history, as well as looking forward into, ah, the future. And, so, what I hope to do today is to talk a little bit about sort of the, the, overall project of historicizing, ah, Asian Americans and Asian American Psychology, and I want to reflect on Asian American Psychology, its roots, uhm, and sort of the process it went through in gaining legitimacy and, ah, possible causes, as well as, ah, ah, the obvious, uhm, the benefits of, uhm, Asian American Psychology, flourishing as a subdiscipline within Ethnic Minority Psychology and, ah, Psychology as a whole. And then, I'd like to end by, uhm, talking a little bit about how we might move, uhm, beyond from here. Okay. Uhm, I usually start my talk with the acknowledgements because by the end, I'm always rushing and I don't leave myself enough time to thank everybody. And so, I'd like to, upfront, ah, acknowledge some of my collaborators, ah, who have helped me with, uhm, ended the conceptual piece of this. And, so, Richard Lee at Minnesota and ah, Stanley Sue, uhm, who is also my, ah, Ph.D. advisor at UC Davis, are my co-authors in the handbook of, uhm, Asian American Psychology chapter, ah, on which this talk is, uhm, partly based. And then, Fred Leong, who is at Michigan State, uhm, has somehow, uhm, you know, uhm, bamboozled me (laughs) into collaborating with, with him on several projects in Asian American history. And, so, we have, ah, book chapter in a handbook on Asia American Psychology's history, as well as the forthcoming piece and the special issue. And so, he's, uhm, with colab, through collaboration with him, I've had opportunities to gain access to some of the, quote, unquote, "historical documents" in Asian American Psychological Association. Some of which I'll share with you today. And of course, because I'm talking about history, uhm, I, I'd like to acknowledge all, ah, who paved the way, ah, including some of the giants in the field such as Derald Sue whose at the Teachers College, uhm, who's one of the, ah, pioneering members of Asian American Psychological Association. So with that, uhm, I'd like to, even though we're talk, ah, the theme of the conference is 25 years reflecting, I'm gonna take us a little bit way back, uhm, and start with the, the Asian American History and, ah, sorry, the master narrative that Asian American historians have weaved for us as we begin our, uhm, our thoughts on Asian American Psychology and how that fits in. Uhm, for many of you might be familiar that in 1882, the Congress enacted the immigration legislation including idiots, lunatics and Chinese laborers, uhm, those are the original words, and of course that's, ah, for many of us, that's a familiar, uhm, ah, as 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. Uhm, this was to be the first of many policies and laws restricting the entry of every Asian group into the U.S. And, so the whole history of Asian Americans in America has been woven in, uhm, tightly with the, uhm, introduction of the legislations that were specifically, ah, targeting them into the entry, controlling the entry and access to privileges within the United States. Uhm, and, of course, I'm just gonna, ah, breeze through a couple of hundred, or I guess 2, 300 years of history, ah, just to get us to the point where we can begin to talk about Asian American history. Of course, uhm, the important piece of the legislation concerning the immigration of Asian, uhm, Asian Americans, ah, the landmark legis, legislation in 1924, the National Origins Act, uhm, targeted primarily Jews, Italians, Slavs, and the Greeks, that the Southern, uhm, and Eastern European were considered, ah, less desirable, ah, immigrants, but also, ah, permanently excluded any aliens ineligible for citizenship, and because, ah, all persons of Asian ancestry were, uhm, ah, ah, legislated to be ineligible for citizenship unless they were born in the United States. Ah, this, in effect, uhm, closed off immigration to all Asians, uhm, at that time, and it also institute a National Quota System, uhm, in which there were different countries giving different quotas. And so just to kinda give us a sense of the kinda system that were set up, in 1931, the quota for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland were 65,000 each, this is an annual quota. In Germany, ah, the quota was 26,000, from Poland and Italy 600 each, and Japan and other Asian nations were given 100, ah, per, ah, quota of, ah, immigrants from those countries, uhm, reserved primarily for white persons and children or missionaries and others who were, uhm, born and, ah, residing in Asia who wi, wish to return to United States. So it can't get more obvious than this in terms of the, the kind of priorities and the biases that were present, in terms of the immigrants that were preferred, uhm, and welcomed into the country. And, of course, I think it's just, you know, much more visually striking to look at just the sort of the ho, hostility, uhm, that early immigrants faced starting by Anti-Chinese Cartoons, ah, around the, ah, late 1800's, ah, early 1920's, ah, Anti- Japanese sentiments. Ah, this is just a sign, an ordinary home, where, ah, the person was trying to make it clear that there, ah, Japanese Americans are not welcome in their neighborhood. To the Filipino, ah, cartoons on a, this, uhm, this, ah, is a picture of a hotel door that says, uhm, " Absolutely no Filipinos allowed." Uhm, and then of course, the, uhm, one of the important, ah, uhm, Asian American historical moments, ah, came in during the World War II, ah, with the internment of Japanese Americans. Many of, ah, two, about two-thirds of whom were, ah, American-born citizens. Okay. And, I'm just kinda going over these landmark moments, uhm, to kinda illustrate that, oh, the time between from the early arrival of the Asian Americans to this country to the Immigration Act of 1965 were just, you know, fought with many, uhm, cycles of initial welcome, ah, as, you know, as, as sources of cheap labor and this, ah, quickly turning into racial hostilities and this kinda, it's a cycle that got repeated with every Asian ethnic group. Uhm, up until the Immigration Act of 1965, that finally eliminated the 1924, ah, National Origins Act, uhm, and got rid of the old quota system, and in fact the, ah, the quota system moved to sort of a hemispheric quota, where each hemisphere were given hundreds of thousands of, uhm, annual quota per hemisphere, uhm, with the, the new emphasis for immigrants, ah, ah, who, those who are applying to the immigration to the United States are family reunification and occupational preferences. Uhm, and that opened a way for a large, uhm, explosion, in, in fact, of immi, immigration from Asian Americans. And 1960's brings us to, where I want to actually begin, my, and the substance of my talk which is the, the beginning of the Asian American his, ah, psychological history, where the, the roots of Asian American Psychology really was in this, ah, with the American, ah, Civil Rights move in the 1960s, and these are some of the, ah, historical documents from the '60s and early '70s where the posters are calling for Asian Americans to kinda co, ah, unite and built coalitions with not just other Asian Americans but also across racial groups. And there was a quote, unquote, "Third World Student Movement," uhm, in, based, ah, in the San Francisco Bay area with the San Francisco State University and UC Berkeley being a sort of the centers of the, uhm, the activities. And, uhm, I think what's worth pointing out is that, although this is a historic moment with many Asian Americans for the first time, ah, Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans and Filipino Americans come in together to build a Pan-Asian consciousness. That is, for the first time, beyond what, identifying themselves as Japanese American or Chinese Americans or, or, ah, worse yet, Orientals. Ah, Asian Americans became sort of empowered to take on and build coalitions across ethnic lines. Uhm, but sort of as product of the immigration history, ah, the coalition building in some ways, across these ethics' lines were, uhm, I don't know what I'll say, easier but we're facilitated by lots of the, the historical, uhm, ah, the, ah, ac, ac, accouterments. So, for example, because the immigration to the United States from Asia were severely restricted up until the 1960's and this movement was happening in the '60s, lot of the student, ah, activist, for the 1960's, were largely children of immigrants who were Chinese or, ah, Japanese or Filipinos or English-speaking, and there were not many Asian ethnic groups at that time. And so, there are largely, uhm, you know, ah, very similar to each other, all English-speaking, and that made the coalition building somewhat, ah, easier across, ah, ethnic lines. Uhm, and here's, ah, a snapshot from a newsletter, I think one of the very, ah, early issues of the im, Asian American Psychological Association newsletter, ah, where Derald Sue, who is here at the Teachers College, who is the first president, and you can just kinda get a sense of just sort of the excitement, as well as the trepidation that happened with Asian American Psychologist as they begin to organize and become, became excited, and there's some hints of, you know, gee, how many of us are really out there? Is any body going to join your organization? And, uhm, and, shortly after the founding of Asian American Psychological Association in the early, ah, '70s, this is sort of a historical archive from the APA, where a conference happened in 1976 in Long Beach, California, ah, sponsored by the Asian American Psychological Association, where this, uhm, of course, I wasn't there. But, uhm, allow me to historicize that these are, uhm, I think, the first gathering of, any size, of Asian American Psychologist and social workers and mental health counselors and educators who came together in significant enough numbers to really kinda think through, where is Asian American, uhm, mental health at this time and where can we go from here. Uhm, and, I don't know if anybody recognizes this, ah, folks in the, ah, 1970s's garb, this is no one saying, ah, for some of you who might have know him. Uhm, uhm, what I wanted to say about the founding of Asian American Psychology was that, you know, at least from my looking through the historical documents of, you know, the 1960s or 1970s, it really was a movement, the beginning of Asian American Psychology is written in the grassroots Civil Rights Movement. Uhm, there was a lot of excitement about social change and social justice in wanting to make Psychology, you know, the beginning of Psychology useful, to make changes especially in, out in the field. And so there was a great deal of uni, university and community partnership. And some of the early, ah, conceptual and practical suggestions for how to achieve, uhm, equity in mental health treatment of Asian Americans, ah, such as those that suggested by the Sue brothers who really came out of that, ah, impetus for social change. So, many of the, uhm, bi, bilingual Asian American Mental Health clinics that were established, the training programs that were established, to train Asian American psychologists to become culturally competent, and so forth came out of that, uhm, sort of the activist movement. Uhm, so from the beginning, what I want to do is just kinda take a quick look at what has transpired in, in, ah, since the founding of Asian American Psychology. Of course, as I hinted with the Immigration Act of 1965, the immigration to, uhm, and the population, the size of Asian American population, marking this as a sort of a turn, really, exponentially, you know, uhm, grew in the last couple of decades where, I think, were pretty close to 2010. And, I think the line might even be steeper because I think the 2006 American Community Survey estimates that Asian Americans are now passed the 5 percent mark in the United States Population and the, im, uhm, immigration has continued, ah, or projected to continue at a fast pace. Okay. And what does, this has meant is that Asian American as a population in, within the United States has become significantly more visible and, ah, sizeable. Uhm, this is, I don't wanna say it's too historical because this is published in the early 90, '90s, but certainly within a young field of Asian American Psychology, this is a bit of a dated document, uhm, at that time. And this is before, ah, Psych Info and, ah, uhm, Psych Lit became a sort of, you know, a desktop phenomenon. So people were still doing a lot of, kind of manual searches and, a document like, ah, this was actually a pretty useful, ah, handbook to have on our desks. Uhm, but certainly when Fred Leong, uhm, and with his colleague, ah, went through the Psych Info to count and, ah, document the abstracts that were available about Asian Americans, ah, at that time, he had found between 1967, pretty much the founding of Asian American Psychology in 1991, just 1057 articles, ah, 556 dissertation, 10 books, and 76 chapters. Ah, recently I had, uhm, students in my Asian American Psychology undergraduate class, do this exercise to kind of look through Psych Info to search for, ah, you know, ah, research articles in Asian Americans, and I, you know, I had them picked different ethnic groups. And some of them, I think, obviously did this wrong because they came up with all kinds of wild numbers. But, you know, each, some of the ethnic group, uhm, literature such as, you know, Chi, Chinese American Psychology, number in, you know, comfortably in the hundreds and, and sometimes in to the thousands. And so, certainly, I think, the explosion of Asian American, ah, scholarship has, ah, coincided with the growth in population. Uhm, and certainly I think, as the field you know, flourished, I think be quickly, I would say, uhm, you know, and established their se, ah, Asian American Psychologists established theirselves within the academy, it became very concern with gaining legitimacy and becoming sort of the part of the academy and the way we, of course, psychologists know to do that and oftentimes to kinda heed the academic tenure track, uhm, ah, a call to do methodologically rigorous studies that are theoretically and conceptually advancing. And, uhm, and many of us, myself included, became sort of part of the, uhm, you know, Research One University Academic departments, where we were, ah, given, I think, the opportunities to do the kind of work, ah, with Asian Americans that may have no been possible in the past. Uhm, and this, again, is a little bit dated because it only goes up to 2000, but you can kinda imagine the, the trajectory of the growth of Asian American Psychology in terms of the number of publications that are being published each year, where the number of articles, obviously, are growing on the book chapters. Ah, sometimes, uhm, ah, is much, uhm, less predictable because with the publication of a handbook of Asian American Psychology, for example, the number goes up and down. But, certainly, I think the trend is all kind of trending upward. And, you know, one of the books that Gord, Gordon Hall and I edited in 2002 where we consider, you know, where is the science of, uhm, Asian American Psychology in 2002, quickly became sort of superseded by the publication of, ah, 2006, ah, handbook of Asian American Psychology, a very, very thick handbook that covered the field in terms of the knowledge base. Uhm, and while this is happening, and there's, I think, ah, quite a bit of excitement in Asian American Psychology, uhm, within the last, uhm, you know, (inaudible ) more students and young professionals enter into the field as both practitioners and scholars. Uhm, you know, of course, this is happening at the same time that the Asian American is growing, but the growth has also meant that Asian American population became much more heterogeneous. So, for example, where is the 1960's grassroots movement, uhm, had occurred in a context of largely east Asian with some Filipino American population, ah, participation? The Asian American population, ah, according to the 2000 Census, has become much more diverse. And of course, the Japanese Americans who were one of the older group, ah, ah, groups, ah, within the United States, their, their numbers, ah, proportionate to other Asian American populations are, ah, somewhat, uhm, smaller as the Japan, the, ah, immigration from Japan is the not most active. Uhm, and certainly, the Chinese, the Asian, ah, South Asian, Indians, and, uhm, Filipino population have really exploded onto the scene. And this list is alphabetical so it's a little bit hard to do the comparison, but you'll get the idea that not only are there more Asian Americans and the route, the proportion is very dynamic over time. There's also the sense that there are a lot more, ah, diversity, ah, just in terms of national diversity or, uhm, of immigrants and communities. Uhm, and along with that kind of demography, there's also much more I think, ah, ah, diversity and heterogeneity, uhm, many dimensions of people's lives. So, for example, of course, gender and sexuality, but certainly the generation of cohorts of Asian Americans who are here in the United States today. Two-thirds are immigrants but even within the immigrant population, there's a lot of differences, ah, in terms of, I mean, now the scholars in Asian American Psychology and other immigrant psychology are not only talking about US-born versus second generation, that is first generation versus second generation, but now, people are starting to make higher distinction between first generation, 1.5 generation, meaning those who came as children, and so, uhm, ah, and so their parents, they came with, immigrated with, with their parents but they're 1.5 generation, meaning that they acquire a bicultural identity that might be sli, slightly different from those of the parents. Uhm, now people are starting to make distinctions even further into 1.25 generation, 1.75 depending on the age of immigration because people, ah, realize that it's important that the development of trajectory and the acquisition of, uhm, cultural characteristics, ah, might actually make a difference if you came as a five-year-old versus it became as a thirteen-year-old, okay? And certainly that national origin we talked about, but certain that the history of the homeland political relation with the United States again is very, very diverse, and so that the US-China relationship, even within the last, ah, you know, post-war, ah, era has waxed and waned in a very different way than, ah, you know, US-, ah, Taiwan relationship or US-, ah, Pakistan relationship and so forth, and those are things that actually, I think, exert forces on the lives, lived lives of the immigrant community as well as those who claim the diasporic identity. Uhm, this is something that we don't often talk about but certainly there are lot of colonial and post-colonial relationships that are very different among the Asian American groups. Uhm, certainly, the Philippines is one group that was directly colonized and occupied by the US and made a US protectorate before they gained their independence. And, ah, my former student, E.J. David, has done lot of beautiful work on post-colonialism in, ah, in the Philippines and, ah, to the legacy of the colonial mentality among, ah, current day Filipino Americans. But again, it's not just that, right? South Asia, ah, in, India, Pakistan, ah, South Asia continent was colonized by the British and the, the fallout from that kind of colonialism is very different from the colonialism that happened in the Philippines. Uhm, and of course the, uhm, the, within Asian colonialization that happened is that, I think a bitter, ah, part that, that, uhm, Asian history that many of us within Asian American community are reluctant to voice, uhm, even though I think, uhm, some of their legacies are still being lived. So, for example, uhm, when I was a student, a practicum student at a, uhm, one of the bilingual, bicultural clinics, Asian American clinics in, ah, Southern California as a graduate student, you know, we we're just kinda sitting in the lunch room eating our lunches and kinda chit-chatting with other clinicians, uhm, one of the, uhm, clinicians who was a Chinese, uhm, immigrant, ah, ah, therapist had kinda approached me and said, "You know, my parents wouldn't believe that I'm talking to a Japanese." You know, his parents had lived through the Japanese occupation of China and, uhm, have a lot of bitter and hostile, you know, hostile, still hostile feelings to the Japanese. And, uhm, certainly, I think the, the, Japan's history, ah, of occupation and colonization of, ah, Korea, South Korea, ah, Korean Pen-, Peninsula and so that the, the legacy of that certainly hasn't been talked about within the, uhm, Asian American community, but I think it does have, sort of, lingering, you know, memory in many of the immigrant communities that, certainly I think it makes for coalition building much more tenuous and difficult because we're talking about, ah, you know, uhm, influx of immigrants who still have many memories of that period. Certainly the, uhm, another vectors of diversity within Asian American, ah, population is the, uhm, the, ah, issue of biracial mixed race versus "monoracial" Asian Americans. And, you know, with the 2000 end census allowing people to check more than one category, the counting, or the accounting of, you know, the proportion of biracial and mixed race, ah, ra, race, Asian Americans had become easier but it's also made our work a little bit more difficult especially in scholarship and also in, ah, writing as when we start to begin to talk about Asian Americans, do we exclude biracials if we're interested in certain phenomenon? Do we include them because to not include them would be marginalizing and so forth. Uhm, certainly the urban versus suburban experience is not something that a psychology has paid a lot of attention to and, of course, within the Asian American immigrant community, there are those who came as refugees versus volunteer minorities, ah, volunteer immigrants and those who have huge effects on psychological experiences, ah, adaptation, English fluency, how much capital they bring from Asia to the United States, plus some mobility issues. These are all vectors of diversity. Certainly they existed to certain extent prior to, you know, 1965, but I would say, I would like to argue that the heterogeneity of the Asian American population today is, I think dizzying, and sometimes I think causes, ah, headaches for many of us who tried to kinda think about, you know, what are the methological implications of that. I think, in effort then to deal with that diversity and to argue for, well, how do we continue to, then, do Asian American psychology, does it make sense to continue to aggregate across ethnic groups that are so diverse and so many dimensions, I think many of us focus on what, what are the common experiences and certainly I think the experience with racial hostility and racism in reaction to, sort of, a world event, uhm, is one that I think, you know, many people in the field have, uhm, latched onto. So this is, ah, some of you may recognize is a picture of a little girl who is kinda wai, waiting, processing to go to an internment camp. It turns out that this picture, uhm, of a girl is, uhm, that of, Yuki Llewellyn, who end up as, ah, one, one of the deans of students at the University of Illinois where I am now. So, small world, uhm, and certainly, this iconic picture post 9-11 of the Sikh Americans who, you know, with, by wearing, ah, American flag, you know, insist that they're Americans even though they're often mistaken because of their turbans and the beards as Mus, Muslim Arabs. Uhm, ah, another dimension that I think, ah, many Asian American psychologists have, uhm, thought about as, you know, what's the common experience among Asian Americans, and that I think is that of a model minority image and this is a familiar image to many of us. Ah, this is, a Ti, Time Magazine cover I think thinking dating back to '80s, mid '80s of those Asian American whiz kids. Uhm, and I think this was, prior year where Asian Americans dominated the Intel Science competition as they tend to do in many, uhm, on a science, and these days, I think Spelling Bee comp, National Spelling Bee competitions that Asians tend to dominate the, the top, you know, finalists. And so, Time Magazine took it upon themselves to profile how amazing these Asian Americans students were. And just recently, I think this, what came out a couple of years ago, uhm, published by two Korean American immigrant sisters, ah, sisters of Korean American immigrant parents who though themselves, they themselves were now parents, talked about their upbringing and how their Korean parents raised them to become high achievers with the intent of giving other parents tools for becoming, ah, raising high achievers, and it's kinda interesting reading through the album, you know, like the, Amazon reader reviews of these, ah, books because there's a certain level of, uhm, ambivalence, if not, hostility by Asian American readers to this kind of, ah trope, uhm, of, that they see as perpetuating model minority stereotypes. Interestingly those who seem to, ah, be, ah, kinda expressing appreciation of these kinds of advice-giving, or African American parents who say, "Oh, this is what we should be doing." So kinda interesting kinda racial undertone going through some of the reviews but, uhm, certainly suddenly, the model minority stereotype as problem when it is, is not anything new. Ah, this is just to evoke the Chinese railroad workers that were, uhm, recruited on mass in the, uhm, ah, late, mid to late 1800s to build a, the transcontinental railroad, the, the Western portion. And at one at one point, it was estimated that 90 percent of the workers of the, ah, the railroad-building were Chinese. And, of course, when the railroad connected and, and they had a ribbon cutting ceremony, the Chinese were, ah, summarily dismissed and were not invited to the ribbon-cutting ceremony. But if you look at this, the historical document at that time, I'll just shift my angle here so I can read this. This was, ah, uhm, ah, written by, ah, J. K. Vance who was a chairman of some kind of a committee that was, ah, appointed to deal with, you know, how to recruit more Chinese workers into the United States, ah, given the labor shortage post, you know, the, uhm, ah, the, uhm, post, ah, Civil War in the, ah, free, freedom, ah, freeing of the African American slaves. He said, "The Chinese laborers have shown, has shown himself industrious, frugal, obedient and attentive to the interest of his employer. He is by nature mild and pacific. His shrewdness and wonderful imitative powers enable him to readily acquire the ne, necessary information and to perform with facility every kind of farm labor. The Chinaman cannot be sup, surpassed, either as a servant or a laborer, by any other, whether you place him in the house, the garden, the field, the workshop, or on the railroad. They work from sunrise until sunset, allowing one hour for dinner and agree to obey, unquestioned, all orders from the owners or manager. It's a pretty striking to look at a historical document and just see the traces of many, you know, uhm, ah, forms of model minority stereotyping. Certainly, ah, with the undertone of pitting against other, uhm, ah, immigrant and slave, ah, former slaves who, ah, were seem to be less desirable work, workers. Now, of course, that, we all know that model minority stereotype for Asian Americans is, I mean, largely, uhm, a harm for, ah, uhm, has a harmful effect. And this, uhm, middle cl, ah, model minority assumption is, a lot of times based some, sort of, the middle class myth that, uhm, were modeled after early, ah, European immigration experience of upper mobility. So immigrants come, they work hard. They, you know, sacrifice, uhm, and if you work hard enough you can make your way into the American, you know, dream, ah, in an incremental way. Uhm, and there's this assumption that there is this linear path toward assimilation and, ah, success within American economy. Uhm, it certainly, nor is the different immigration pathways that are, uhm, ah, being documented by sociologists. And not only are there Asian Americans today are made up of volunteer immigrants but certainly refugees and international students and transnationals who go back and forth with the families that are truly transpacific and transcontinental in these ways. Uhm, this is, ah, borrow from Claire Jin Kim's(ph), uhm, work on segmented assimilation or, it's not, ah, Claire Jin Kim. This is, uhm, ah, Ming Tsao Tzo(ph), uhm, where they argued that the mobility pathways for many Asian Americans, uhm, the linear as, ah, associ, uhm, linear pathway that is assumed to be going from lower social class in Asia to time in the United States. The more time you spend, the more middle class status you achieve. It's sort of the, the myth of model minority, ah, ah, acculturation, but certainly there are many different pathways including those who are in a working class who, there's a, you know, initial dip in their social class and economic, uhm, power within the United States shortly after immigration, but they achieve a working class status to those who come from privilege class who bec, bring lots of social capital to the United States and so they start up higher and end up, uhm, uhm, at the, ah, at the top of the pile, so to speak. And then those who are, who start up poor and end up poor in, in the United States, and also those who make a less linear pathway toward, ah, working poor. But I think there's a large underclass of Asian Americans in the economy, American economy that are unacknowledged by each American psychologist because we leave that work to sociologists. You go study class. We don't do class. But certainly I think those, ah, voices of Asian Americans who are not the middle class or, you know, elite privileged class are a lot of times not, uhm, seen within the, the scholar, the literature on Asian Americans.

SUMIE OKAZAKI  Now there are other ways in which, which Rich, Lee, Stan, Sue, and I had talked about, you know, what are the effects of this mo, model minority, ah, myth within the psychology and that, we, and the research literature on Asian Americans? Uhm, for one, I think we argue that, uhm, myth of the model minority, uhm, stereotype is conveniently reinforced in selective ways, ah, for Asian Americans to kind of can help(ph) the cultural values. A nail that sticks down gets hammer down, ah, you know, in sort of a, uhm, Confucius says kind of a way of talking about, uhm, ah, Asian American culture values in a way that I think are sometimes, uhm, it, ah, reduces the Asian Americans to, sort of, aphorisms and, ah, convenient, ah, ah, sort of thing. I think the model minority myth also castly, castrates, ah, Asian Americans. Ah, that is, what we mean by that is that I think it keeps him invisible because there is this myth that the Asian Americans are hardworking. They're not complaining, and if you just leave them alone to be, to acculturate, ah, they will be fine and certainly prevents, uhm, Asian Americans from seeking civic and political activism because of the model minority myth that I think many Asian Americans themselves subscribe to, that is Asian Americans themselves have a stake in seeing ourselves as the hardworking minorities who sacrifice and, and work hard, and, or turn to, you know, grab the, a piece of American, ah, dream is coming our way. And many, I think many immigrant parents, ah, you know, ascribe to that, ah, for themselves as well, well as for their parents. And certainly for some, uhm, sociologists who are working in this area see, ah, Asian Americans as, ah, serving as the middleman wedge between whites and Blacks and this is the classic middle, ah, modern minority myth, ah, Asian Americans are problem-free but they're also forever foreigners. That is Asian Americans are cast as, ah, model minority in relation to the rest of the, uhm, American racial hierarchy. And so, this is work by Claire Jin Kim, uhm, in which, uhm, Kim cast Asian Americans as sort of, in the middle ground between, ah, sort of, inferior-superior hierarchy, a racial hierarchy that's hegemonic within the United States, but at the same time, Asian Americans are seen, sort of, as a foreigner, ah, who will never become part of the American culture and, thus, somewhat safe and less threatening, ah, than a, ah, African Americans who are pa, seen as part of the American cul, ah, ah, racial history and, thus, uhm, need to ostracized in some ways. Uhm, and what happens is that, as model minority, uhm, picture of Asian Americans emerges, it's often, I think implicitly, contrasted with the African American characteristics. Oops, uhm, so certainly, oh, the graphic here is cut off by sys, respect for, uhm, I think elder and respect for, ah, education perhaps. Uhm, certainly the mo, model of the characteristics of personality, the Asian Americanness of Asian Americans are often characterized as cultural values, strong family values that we have, discipline, diligence, respect for authority, ah, they're thrifty, self-sufficient, and respects education, uhm, certainly mapping in contrast to often the stereotypical, ah, depiction of African Americans and other, ah, ah minorities in the United States. And what, I think it's interesting for Asian American Psychology research is that these kind of model minority characteristics then get mapped onto research content. So, for example, and again this is a little bit of a, uhm, stress, but in terms of, you know, diligence, we see that as, you know, uhm, mapping onto acculturation research where Asian Americans, because of their cultural values of diligence and hard work, uhm, ah, there's this, sort of, a trajectory, the master narrative of acculturation as rewarding that diligence with, uhm, increased, uhm, ah, achievement, for example. The discipline of Asian Americans also are, I think are often mirrored in the parenting literature, the strong family values. There's a, you know, large literature on family obligation, and, uhm, largely trying to say that even though Asian American children have lot of strong, ah, family obligation, and they, uhm, ah, play a parent, a, ah, parentified role within Amer, Asian American immigrant families, that such obligations are not harmful to the mental health of children. Ah, the Asian value of respect for authority, I think, uhm, gets cast as, you know, a focus on collectivism as a cultural value and there's a lot of, lot of literature where collectivism is used as an explanatory variable for Asian American psychology. Let's see. Uhm, let's see, thriftiness, uhm, is mapped onto just, so, general Asian values and behavior. Self sufficiency, ah, can be mapped on, perhaps to career interest and choice and their respect for, uhm, education, gets mapped onto academic achievement literature. So, the bulk of Asian American research can somehow, I think, be tied to sort of the modern minority myth and are, in one way, in some ways, ah, Asian American scholars' response to trying to contest the minor, minority, model minority stereotype, but are also, I think, in some ways exceeding to the image of model minorities. Uhm, and certainly, I think the prevailing methods in Asian American psychology research where we're very focused on scientific rigor. Uhm, in order to gain legitimacy in academy, I think, also, uhm, ha, has us doing lot of top-down theorizing, that is because we're asked to do theoretical articles, every article has to have a theory, every article has to have a rationale that's compelling and developing new theories that I think a lot of Asian American scholars are then driven to impose a theory, perhaps skipping the step of talking to the actual Asian American communities and Asian American, ah, individuals, whose replies(ph) may not fit into our linear or, you know, ah, a small, ah, kind of a theory that we, uhm, hypothesize about their lives and the trajectory. Uhm, certainly, I think the, ah, prevailing method in Asian American psychology and this is not just Asian American psychology, I think, it's much of psychology research, uhm, makes essentialist assumptions, uhm, and methods. So for example, many times, uhm, Chinese Americans are still seen as, sort of, ah, prototype of Asian Americans and literature from Chinese Americans are then appropriated to signify that this is how Asian Americans are. Uhm, certainly, ah, there are still a lot of methods, uhm, and research articles, myself included in term, ah, terms of that, ah, guilty party of those who persist on doing cross-cultural and ethnic group comparisons with the notion that somehow the Asian Americans have exs, Asian American psychology, our values, our cultural, ah, behavior or practices, our attitudes need to be explained in contrast to the, uhm, the, "mainstream" Americans often, ah, proxeed(ph), uhm, for, ah, white Americans. Uhm, other ways in which I, I think, ah, Asian American, ah, psychology research, uhm, has tried to gain le, legitimacy, is to really go for the main effect, models you want the sig, statistical significance and so you're going for the big effect, and what happens is that you end up focusing on very static variables, such as generational status, language use, ah, that are easy to measure and, you know, somewhat easy to get, ah, big effects on, uhm, and as well as I think, sort of, that accepted the cultural variables such as a acculturation, values and identity. Again, those are that, uhm, have gained currency, I think, uhm, within Asian American psychology. And finally, uhm, there's a, ah, focus, perhaps, uhm, advertent, some, perhaps inadvertent in terms of those who are college educated, up, really mobile young adults as the, ah, primary "subjects" of our study, some of that, I think is, uhm, a product of Asian American, ah, you know, ah, academy where many of us who are doing research are at these(ph) research one universities or a large state universities and the access to the college educated population is the easiest way to, ah, for us to, ah, get our scholarship done and certainly there's lot of methological, ah, difficulties in, ah, doing studies with Asian American populations who are not college educated students because they have to work with immigration status, the language barriers and so forth. But what happens is that these are, sort of, the top of the, the cream of the crop Asian Americans, right those who are, have achieved, uhm, modicum of, ah, ah, success within the American, ah, society and these are the people that we study and write about, to the exclusion of the voices of Asian, ah, other Asian Americans. Laura Uba, who is, ah, Asian American studies professor at, ah, Cal State, ah, Northridge, is one person I think who has kinda taken the, uhm, stance largely from ethnic minority psychology and Asian American psychology to talk about, uhm, "What's wrong with this picture?" Let's take a step back and say, "Are we really starting, you know, able to capture the lived experiences of Asian Americans by using the methodology that, and, sort of, discourse that are available?" Ah, I know there's a lot of fine print here, but, I'm watching the time, so when I get through to the main punch line. Uhm, and so my argument is that as Asian American psychology gain legitimacy, uhm, as I mentioned, I think acculturation became, sort of, hyper pri, privileged variable where culture became the predominant way to explain Asian American behavior over, ah, other matters that are important, such as race and, uhm, and so forth, and college students' voices became priv, privileged over others, and it will also revert to very ahistorical analyses of our behavior. At the same time, the lived experiences of Asian American became much more heterogeneous as well as much more global. And just a co, a couple of cute pictures to illustrate that. This is an opening, celebrating the opening of KFC in China, where, and I think this is like a funny, ah, ah, culture artifact of globalization where all the Chinese children are dancing the Colonel, ah, Sanders Chicken dance. Uhm, other ways in which I think Asian American, uhm, psychology has not quite responded to the, the, you know, the rapid changes within Asia who are now sending many students to the United States. One is, uhm, I wanted to, ah, mention the work by Vanessa Fong who is the, ah, uhm, educational anthropologist at Harvard Graduate School, and she's doing a, a, work, ah, just beautiful work on the, the effects of China's One Child policy on the family life and the psychology of, ah, Chinese singleton, "singletons." Uhm, many of, she's, uhm, following them longitudally and many of the students that she had study as teenagers in China are now college students and young adults and many of them are coming to the United States, uhm, to, uhm, follow their, sort of, cosmopolitan dream that, uhm, came out of the, the Chinese One Child policy. Uhm, just to plug, uhm, that, uhm, this, ah, next month, ah, my colleagues and I in, at the University of Illinois are, are sponsoring a first workshop, ah, ah, conference, international conference on South Korea's educational exodus, and again this is another sort of a interesting, uhm, variant of what's happening in the, in, in Asia that are affecting the Asian American, ah, community even on college campuses and high schools and sometimes middle schools where many, ah, South Korean parents because of the hugely eco, you know, huge economic insight(ph) that, ah, arose from post, uhm, IMF crisis are now rushing to send their, ah, ah, young children and adolescents in middle school and high school to the United States and other English speaking countries to gain English fluency and to enterate, uhm, American higher education. So again, psychology is barely catching our breath with, you now, these globalizing phenomena are, uhm, ah, you know, diversifying our Asian American population even more. So just in closing, what I like to do is to, uhm, propose, uhm, let me just put it off there, ah, the, the, as we move forward in Asian American psychology and to think about the ways in which our history and our narrative of Asian Americans and Am, Asian American history have shaped our scholarship, I think it's time to start moving beyond the model minority search, and what we, ah, propose as Asian American psychology is to say that our scholarship needs to be informed as much by ethnic studies, that is the interdisciplinary project of Asian American studies where we, uhm, incorporate, sort of, the narrative as well as the, the, you know, easy to measure variables that are, you know, handy tools of psychologists. Uhm, we certainly want to move away from the model, I think, notion of Asian Americans as one thing that can be signified by stu, studying, you know, highly educated college, upwardly mobile students. Uhm, certainly we want to im, understand the impact of racialized minority status on individuals, families, and communities, as well as on programs of research. We want to start to recognize new family structures in Asian Americans, I'll finish up, Sue. Uhm, as I hinted by the, you know, the families that are being affecting, increasingly by globalization and transnationalism. And finally, to situate our Asian American persons and communities within the historical and sociopolitical ah, context, brings,(ph) ah, from some of the, ah, pioneering work that are happening in sociology and flexible citizenship, segmented assimilation and what it means for Asian Americans today to have much more of a heterogeneous hybrid, ah, multiple identities. So, I will end here and I thank you for your attention.
