00:00:45
DAIDGE (ph) Yeah. 

00:00:50

00:00:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) But it's easier to be yourself… 

00:00:55
Exactly. 

00:00:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:00:55
SAM STEEN Its easier to be yourself? I would agree with that. So, how do you feel about the fact that we really have two sessions left? 

00:01:00
Oh very good. 

00:01:00
SAM STEEN It's okay? 

00:01:05
Hmm… hmm… 

00:01:05

00:01:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I'm going to miss them maybe… 

00:01:05

00:01:05

00:01:05
We're gonna miss it a more. 

00:01:10
SAM STEEN You… you like forward to go more you're gonna miss it, a little bit sad. But it… but you know its fine but you realize how fun it is. 

00:01:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And it's already going to be 6 o'clock. 

00:01:20
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:01:20
SAM STEEN Time is going about so fast. 

00:01:25
SHERI BAUMAN We just yeah… but… 

00:01:25
Maybe 6' o clock we can leave. 

00:01:25
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… that's right. 

00:01:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Since we start early… 

00:01:30
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:01:30
SHERI BAUMAN Good thing, okay. 

00:01:30
SAM STEEN The time goes by so fast is that what you're saying? Is that right? 

00:01:35
Exactly(ph). 

00:01:35
SAM STEEN Dordge(ph) did you hear that? He was just saying that the time goes by so fast. 

00:01:40
DORDGE (ph) Time flies. 

00:01:40
SAM STEEN Time… that… 

00:01:40
Yeah. 

00:01:40
SAM STEEN …especially when you're having… 

00:01:40
SHERI BAUMAN Great, right yeah. 

00:01:45
ROBIN (ph) Well, what mom says, she says that when you're having fun driving… something time flies like… 

00:01:50
That's my mom daily says… 

00:01:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and when you're… when you're bored it creeps by. So we're not going to be bored today. We've been talking a lot about the ways that people are different and the ways that we're the same… 

00:02:05
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… 

00:02:05
SHERI BAUMAN …and we're gonna do a little activity to help kind of… 

00:02:05
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… 

00:02:10
SHERI BAUMAN …bring that back to our attention. So, I would like each of you to take, I'm going to pass in both ways six strips… 

00:02:15
SAM STEEN But explain before you pass it out, because once they get it they know that… 

00:02:20
SHERI BAUMAN That's true that's a good idea. 

00:02:20
SAM STEEN Okay, so listen to the… 

00:02:20
SHERI BAUMAN So let me tell you, what you're going to do when you get them. You notice that there are different kinds of crayons and markers and ah that sort of thing. When you get your strips you're gonna get six. On four of them you're going to put and you can put it in words or a design or a picture anything that you like ways that you are the same as at least one other person in the group. So fours, four are same and two are ways that you are special or unique or maybe the only one in the… in this group of people. You can just write it in words or you can draw it or… 

00:03:05
DAIDGE (ph) So how would the same with someone else? 

00:03:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right, at least one maybe more but the four sames and two special or unique so that… 

00:03:10
SAM STEEN So that make sense? 

00:03:10
SHERI BAUMAN …the first step. 

00:03:10
Hmm… hmm… 

00:03:10
SHERI BAUMAN So we need six. 

00:03:15
SAM STEEN Ileana(ph) had a question, go ahead. 

00:03:15
ILEANA MEIN (ph) You ask to write the name of the person? 

00:03:15
SHERI BAUMAN No. no just ways something, so it could be like appearance, it could be cultural it could be… 

00:03:25
SAM STEEN Simple thing or… 

00:03:25
SHERI BAUMAN A skill or a talent or a language or ah anything. Okay. 

00:03:30
SAM STEEN Does that make sense? 

00:03:30
Uh… huh.. yeah. 

00:03:30
Yeah. 

00:03:30
SAM STEEN And then two that are different… and you can pick any colors you want just make sure you separate it. 

00:03:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, and you can do in any way you want. So you could use words but if you like to draw and can come up with the symbol… 

00:03:45
SAM STEEN That's very important. 

00:03:45
SAM STEEN You were saying can you pick the same color? 

00:03:50
DORDGE (ph) No. 

00:03:55
SAM STEEN Um… 

00:03:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I can do something better. 

00:03:55
SHERI BAUMAN And what about the color selection is important. 

00:04:00
SAM STEEN Uh… huh… Uh… huh… 

00:04:00
SHERI BAUMAN Ha… ha… ha… 

00:04:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) So (inaudible ) drinking. 

00:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN You take six and on four you're going to put away that you're similar to at least one other person and on two you're going to put away that you're special or unique or you think you probably are the only one. 

00:04:20
SAM STEEN Oh yes, you can absolutely. I thought you may pick the color green. 

00:04:25
SHERI BAUMAN What? 

00:04:25
SAM STEEN She was asking if she said that she likes collard greens, was that okay? 

00:04:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh… okay, ha ha ha… 

00:04:30
SAM STEEN Yeah… yeah… we like the same food. 

00:04:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right, because you know you're not the only one. 

00:04:35
SAM STEEN Oligue(ph) how many do you have? 

00:04:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I got six! 

00:04:40
SAM STEEN Ha ha ha… 

00:04:45
SHERI BAUMAN So you can use any of the color in it. 

00:04:55
[sil.] 

00:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN No, any way you want so you can… 

00:05:10
ILEANA MEIN (ph) (inaudible ) it seems. 

00:05:11
SHERI BAUMAN There you go… absolutely. 

00:05:15
ALEX (ph) What is black in the… 

00:05:15
SHERI BAUMAN Ooh! That would be hard, wouldn't that? 

00:05:20
SAM STEEN There may be a white, you know Alex(ph) they're might be a white. Alex(ph) there might be a white crayon in that. 

00:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN I doubted. Let's see. 

00:05:30
SAM STEEN And the 64? 

00:05:30
DAIDGE (ph) Yeah, there is white in 64. 

00:05:30
SAM STEEN I told you our color would now line off the crayon. Really as a color I would say that one… 

00:05:40
SHERI BAUMAN You're going to take leftovers. 

00:05:40
SAM STEEN I'm waiting for her yeah. 

00:05:45
So our… 

00:05:45
SHERI BAUMAN Four ways that you're the same as at least one other person. Something about you that's, you got, you know you're similar to some at least someone else. And two ways that you're different than anybody else. It's a good idea let's make it easier to see. 

00:06:05
SAM STEEN Thanks. 

00:06:05
Why make this? 

00:06:05
SAM STEEN Sure we needs some… 

00:06:05
SHERI BAUMAN Graphics(ph) the next part. Yes, I need some. 

00:06:15
Okay, so let us… 

00:06:15
SHERI BAUMAN What we're saying, four ways that you are at the same or similar to at least one other person in the group and two ways that you think you're special or unique or different from at least everybody. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe you can draw or write or… 

00:06:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And sometimes you can guess who is the same… 

00:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN You might, but we're not going to have to put that. 

00:06:55
SAM STEEN Yep, that's finally with me… what about you? 

00:06:55

00:20:20
SAM STEEN Just slide the chair. 

00:20:20
SHERI BAUMAN So to start with Roman(ph) has to start and we’re just gonna share with the group one of your ways that you’re similar to at least one other person in the group. 

00:20:30
I like boys(ph). 

00:20:35
SHERI BAUMAN And you’re similar to couple of people I know and what’s your different? One different? 

00:20:35
ROMAN (ph) And my different is that my family is from Russia (inaudible ) 

00:20:41
SHERI BAUMAN Cool, thank you. Ah ha 

00:20:45
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… I’m the only one wearing a bandage and ahh we’re all having fun. 

00:20:55
SHERI BAUMAN Great. 

00:20:55
SAM STEEN I know. 

00:20:55
SHERI BAUMAN Dordge(ph)? 

00:21:00
DORDGE (ph) Ah, I’m the only one wearing yellow and ahhh I like rap music. 

00:21:05
SHERI BAUMAN Very well I mean I bet you have some company with that huh, okay your turn. 

00:21:10
ALEX (ph) Ah, my mom and you have the same last name and and we don’t, we don’t have the same red face. 

00:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN Hmm right although we did, we maybe, we should find out huh. Do you think its possible than anybody else? 

00:21:25
DAIDGE (ph) Last time (inaudible ) 

00:21:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah okay and you? 

00:21:30
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I am the only person who likes social studies and I don’t have family. 

00:21:35
SHERI BAUMAN Great, great Oligue(ph). 

00:21:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Hmm, I don’t, I don’t like black (inaudible ) and we all have good hearts. 

00:21:43
SHERI BAUMAN Oh okay, that is very nice. 

00:21:43
DORDGE (ph) I mean what? 

00:21:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) nd we all have a good hearts. 

00:21:50
DORDGE (ph) Okay. 

00:21:55
SHERI BAUMAN Sam anything from you? 

00:21:55
SAM STEEN Ahh I think the one that’s the same is that we were all willing to take risk. 

00:22:00
DORDGE (ph) Okay 

00:22:00
SAM STEEN Do you agree with that? And that’s the same. And one that’s different I live in Virginia. 

00:22:10
DORDGE (ph) Okay. 

00:22:10
DAIDGE (ph) I think it is close to (inaudible ) for what? 

00:22:12
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:22:12
DORDGE (ph) Are you from Tennessee? 

00:22:15
SAM STEEN That’s where I was born. 

00:22:15
I came from Russia. 

00:22:15
I think you can carry on…. 

00:22:20
SHERI BAUMAN It’s my turn. Okay so for my different, I think it’s safe to say I’m probably the only one in this group who’s been married for more than 25 years. Do you think that’s probably safe and then the rest of you unmarried that long? And one way I’m the same as some people is that there are several of us girls in here. 

00:22:40
Two, three,… 

00:22:40
Two, three, four, five… 

00:22:40
ROMAN It’s the same amount of girls and the boys. 

00:22:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah so here’s Part B. These are all different colors and we put all different things and they’re individual but now we’d like you to create something together some kind of ahh creation. It could be… 

00:23:00
SAM STEEN Whatever you want… 

00:23:00
SHERI BAUMAN Whatever you want and if you would like to use that you can but if you don’t want to, you don’t have to but some way to put these together and make something to kind of look at that would represent the sameness and the differences in this group. Okay? So you have some glue and you have more color if you need it and you have that if you’d like to use it and we’re gonna ask you… 

00:23:25
SAM STEEN In about 10 minutes. 

00:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN …in about 10 minutes yeah to see how creative you can be to come up with something that’s ‘coz this is really what we’re about, mostly similarities and some special differences, yes. 

00:23:40
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Are we doing this together? 

00:23:40
SHERI BAUMAN We are doing this together except Sam and I are just going to watch. 

00:23:45
SAM STEEN If that’s okay.

00:27:20
ROMAN (ph) And this is a bit hard. 

00:27:25
SAM STEEN You don’t work huh? 

00:27:25
You said the wrong one. 

00:27:25
He said too big for me. 

00:27:25
SAM STEEN We’ll take it back. 

00:27:25
This is just like a rubber. 

00:27:30
SAM STEEN Roman(ph) let me see. 

00:27:30
You like bottles? 

00:27:30
Yeah, everybody (inaudible ) 

00:27:35
You guys were doing another… 

00:27:35
Yeah, yeah, I’m not. 

00:27:40
 Let someone talk. 

00:27:40
That’s what I said. 

00:27:40
SHERI BAUMAN We, I’m the only one from the Bronx. 

00:27:40
SAM STEEN I’m not going to tell you. 

00:27:50
This is a rubber. 

00:27:50
I want to know… (inaudible ) 

00:27:52
SHERI BAUMAN This is… 

00:27:52
You got now… 

00:27:52
SHERI BAUMAN Is this supposed to be the glue? 

00:27:52
SAM STEEN Not, it’s not in there. There’s no glue in there. 

00:27:55
So we, we found… 

00:27:55
SAM STEEN We bought empty ones. 

00:28:00
Oh. 

00:28:00
SHERI BAUMAN Were these suppose… 

00:28:00
You guys got ripped top off 

00:28:00
SAM STEEN It’s not a glue stick it’s just a stick. Isn’t that cool? 

00:28:05
SHERI BAUMAN So where we are supposed to buy by another part of it, these would be effective. 

00:28:10
SAM STEEN No Sheri, yeah we rip this off. 

00:28:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh well. Well then you have to be even more creative. 

00:28:15
SAM STEEN If then they’re good they go. 

00:28:20
Or may be we can tape them. 

00:28:20
They said… 

00:28:20
SHERI BAUMAN That’s what it sounds like. 

00:28:20
I know, but I’m gonna tape it at the corner first. 

00:28:25
We do know. 

00:28:25
We can tape it all over. 

00:28:30
SHERI BAUMAN I don’t know. I can do that while you guys work ‘coz remember we were only going to take 10 minutes and we’ve probably spent five. 

00:28:35
SAM STEEN uh huh 

00:28:35
You guys just complete yours. 

00:28:35
I know that was always there.

I’m the only person from Russia. 

00:28:50
Okay. 

00:28:50
I don’t… 

00:28:50
Well, you’re not. 

00:28:55
Wait, you have the most put in but it is not fair to meet (inaudible ) 

00:28:57
I don’t even have mine. I only have… 

00:29:00
Yeah, oh yeah. 

00:29:05
Yeah. 

00:29:05
And we have to tape it. 

00:29:05
This is mine. 

00:29:05
(inaudible ) 

00:29:10
SAM STEEN You rather just leave it there. 

00:29:10
That’s mine. 

00:29:10
You’re from… 

00:29:10
SAM STEEN What have you done? 

00:29:15
Yeah, I’ve an idea. Let me see it. Let me see the tape. 

00:29:15
I’m want different colors. 

00:29:15
Let me see the tape. I have an idea. Just tape the whole thing out. 

00:29:20
No. 

00:29:20
A big outline, a big outline. 

00:29:25
(crosstalk)(Inaudible ) 

00:29:26
Daidge(ph) no, it’ll be faster. 

00:29:30
Yes. 

00:29:30
Yeah. 

00:29:30
SAM STEEN Are you okay with that? You better engage in my work. 

00:29:35
Now. 

00:29:35
Yes. 

00:29:35
SAM STEEN You might wanna check him with your, your, your roommates(ph). 

00:29:35
It’ll be alone. 

00:29:35
No. 

00:29:35
We don’t have to do it. 

00:29:40
That’s ugly. Who cares. 

00:29:40
SAM STEEN I got an idea, I hope you don’t mind you were saying can you tape it later maybe. 

00:29:45
Yeah. 

00:29:45
SAM STEEN Or you done, is that what you wanted to look like? 

00:29:50
No. It doesn’t matter. 

00:29:50
SAM STEEN Is that what you wanted to look like? 

00:29:50
Yeah. 

00:29:50
SHERI BAUMAN I don’t care. 

00:29:55
This is going to take you about an hour to tape all those. 

00:29:55
Okay, that one. Look at this. 

00:30:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay remember you have about three more minutes. 

00:30:00
Wow. 

00:30:05
Just now we’re doing. 

00:30:05
SHERI BAUMAN Three minutes. 

00:30:05
(inaudible ) 

00:30:07
I’m taping it. 

00:30:07
where have you been. 

00:30:10
No. 

00:30:10
Yes. 

00:30:10
No no. 

00:30:10
We’ve only got three minutes just tape it. 

00:30:10
SHERI BAUMAN But you could tape it. 

00:30:10
Just wait now. Just go. 

00:30:15
SAM STEEN You can tape it later if you like. How about that? 

00:30:15
Yeah. 

00:30:15
We are not gonna tape it. 

00:30:15
Just go on. 

00:30:20
No, just tape it. 

00:30:20
Yeah. 

00:30:20
SAM STEEN It looks like the guys are saying just tape it and it looks like the girls say no don’t tape it… 

00:30:25
I just say it just take about hour. 

00:30:25
SHERI BAUMAN Boys just tekk always do it, girls wanna make that one free. 

00:30:30
Just tape it 

00:30:30
Just tape it. 

00:30:30
Just tape it 

00:30:30
Just tape it 

00:30:35
Just tape it 

00:30:35
SHERI BAUMAN Well this is interesting. We have a little difference of opinion. 

00:30:35
SAM STEEN They were in a little conflict. 

00:30:40
Who wants, who wants it to be tapped just like that 

00:30:40
I don’t wanna be quick (inaudible ) 

00:30:45
Yeah. 

00:30:45
No. 

00:30:45
Hmm… 

00:30:45
crosstalk (inaudible ) 

00:30:50
Get me the tape. 

00:30:50
And fold it and put it down. 

00:30:50
No. 

00:30:50
Well, I think we made a mistake. 

00:30:55
Why don’t you take it off? 

00:31:00
You guys are gonna cut this out. 

00:31:00
Hahaha 

00:31:00
Okay. 

00:31:00
(inaudible ) 

00:31:05
You should show them how girls want always think the need. 

00:31:10
This is… boys are so bossy. 

00:31:15
Yeah. 

00:31:15
You should (inaudible ) 

00:31:16
You should just tapes. 

00:31:16
No I don’t think you’re faster 

00:31:16
You should point and we should… 

00:31:20
Guys have good idea to breaking things faster. 

00:31:25
(crosstalk) 

00:31:25
No. 

00:31:30
Bad man(ph). 

00:31:30
You hurry up. 

00:31:30
Oh my god. 

00:31:35
You know you need to do till… 

00:31:35
Alright no. 

00:31:40
Little bit faster. 

00:31:40
No. 

00:31:40
Cut them 

00:31:40
ALEX (ph) Hurry up give me the tape, please. 

00:31:45
Okay, do you know why? 

00:31:45
ALEX (ph) There is the tape. 

00:31:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, you know what because we have limited time I’m going to suggest that we just place things right now and then we can glue over a little bit later. How’s that? 

00:31:55
That’s (inaudible ) people look at there. 

00:31:58
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah so, so just yeah here we go… 

00:32:00
Alright 

00:32:00
SAM STEEN You can take a little bit. 

00:32:00
Oh yeah. Someone just put the glue. 

00:32:05
SHERI BAUMAN Why don’t you come out and talk to him. 

00:32:05
I can do it. . 

00:32:10
SAM STEEN Can they tape it… 

00:32:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh yeah. 

00:32:10
SAM STEEN …outside yes they can do it. 

00:32:10
That’s already taped. 

00:32:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay lets… 

00:32:15
I thought this way, you guys are making me frustrated. 

00:32:15
SAM STEEN You’re frustrated about… 

00:32:20
ALEX (ph) Them, the boys 

00:32:25
Girls. 

00:32:25
SAM STEEN We’ll get to boys(ph). 

00:32:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yes we can hahaha. 

00:32:25
…that is movie about how girls wanna be needy(ph) and how boys wanna be we don’t care. 

00:32:30
Why? 

00:32:30
We just think how boy really won’t be attacking. 

00:32:35
SAM STEEN Okay 

00:32:35
I don’t even know what attacking means. 

00:32:35
Because we put that down (inaudible ) in front of me. 

00:32:40
I don’t care. 

00:32:40
No matter. 

00:32:40
Leave it, leave it (inaudible ) 

00:32:45
SHERI BAUMAN So ahh we’re getting back to our chairs. 

00:32:45
It has been, this is fine. 

00:32:50
Is everything taped? 

00:32:50
Everything is tapped so hard(ph). 

00:32:50
SHERI BAUMAN Is it really? 

00:32:50
Yeah. 

00:32:55
You know it’s been like 15 minutes faster. 

00:32:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay so I have some questions for… 

00:33:00
(crosstalk) 

00:33:00
SAM STEEN Just like that? 

00:33:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. Is that kind of a bit of a mess but we’ll take care of that. 

00:33:05
SAM STEEN Do you have your seat? 

00:33:05
uh huh 

00:33:10
Alright. 

00:33:10
Alright 

00:33:10
SAM STEEN Oh lets drag the chair a little bit 

00:33:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:33:10
Slide the chair. 

00:33:15
SHERI BAUMAN Would you, (inaudible ) your chair up a little bit. Thank you. So first of all here is, here is our creation. But I want to talk a little bit about how you went about doing this and working together as a team. What did you notice? What, what did you do well, what did you do not so well Daidge(ph)? 

00:33:35
DAIDGE (ph) Not so well by team work (inaudible ) 

00:33:37
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:33:37
SHERI BAUMAN Yes so that we had some challenges and it was harder because we’ve been giving really enough time to do. 

00:33:40
SAM STEEN Alright. 

00:33:40
SHERI BAUMAN So that added to it. What were some things you did do well? 

00:33:45
ROMAN (ph) I got ideas. 

00:33:50
SHERI BAUMAN You got ideas what else? 

00:33:50
What is that? 

00:33:50
SHERI BAUMAN What else? 

00:33:55
We both taped the one together. 

00:33:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay so different people cooperated in doing the task. How things get started? 

00:34:05
I suggest that we make like as, like a safety circle, not the safety circle but the ahhh… 

00:34:10
Say it’s a kind… 

00:34:15
SAM STEEN Comfort zone. 

00:34:15
Comfort zone. 

00:34:15
SAM STEEN uh huh 

00:34:15
And it actually did, it kind of turned out like that because the out one its sideways, on the sideways and then the middle I think the… like a circle that we have. So yeah something like that. 

00:34:25
SAM STEEN So, are the things different? So the ones in the outside or the ones that you felt more comfortable about sharing or… 

00:34:35
We just worked in random order. 

00:34:35
SAM STEEN Just random oh but just the way you describe it. 

00:34:35
SHERI BAUMAN So you sort of took the initiative in where the leader in a way of getting things going? 

00:34:40
Kind of sort off 

00:34:40
SHERI BAUMAN Is that, is that something that you do in other settings too like, are you a kind of a leader? 

00:34:45
Well, kind of sort off not really. 

00:34:50
SAM STEEN uh huh well thanks for taking the risk here. I’ve noticed that ahh I felt like you all really shared how you felt like boys are this way, girls are this way ahhh (inaudible ) shared I’m frustrated because you didn’t really say why you were frustrated but she said I’m frustrated but… 

00:35:05
Boys don’t care if it’s needed (inaudible ) how to deal. 

00:35:09
SAM STEEN Oh yeah, but even still you came up you were able to come up with something you know. 

00:35:10
SHERI BAUMAN And it’s interesting we’ve been talking a lot about cultural differences and I apologize I just interrupted… 

00:35:15
SAM STEEN That’s really nice of you. 

00:35:20
SHERI BAUMAN Ahh and ways that our backgrounds are different but we hadn’t talked a lot about male, female differences, boy we should notice that in this activity and that it seemed as though there were different approach to doing this among the girls and the boys huh. 

00:35:35
SAM STEEN And is it okay if we don’t always agree? 

00:35:40
Yeah. 

00:35:40
SAM STEEN I mean will that be realistic for us to expect that you’re always going to get along and always going to agree with each other? Is that realistic isn’t it. 

00:35:45
No. 

00:35:45
No. 

00:35:45
SAM STEEN No what do you think Dordge(ph)? Is that realistic? 

00:35:50
DORDGE (ph) uh huh I don’t know. 

00:35:50
SAM STEEN You’re not sure. 

00:35:50
SHERI BAUMAN Do you have something you want to share? 

00:35:55
ROMAN (ph) I think it’s realistic because everyone should get along with each other. 

00:36:00
SHERI BAUMAN And what happens when, when you disagree ‘coz part of being you mean is that sometimes you don’t agree, how do you. 

00:36:05
ROMAN (ph) May be like the majority will. 

00:36:10
SHERI BAUMAN Sometimes but then what happens to the minority who get, who, whose decision you know doesn’t win? 

00:36:15
DORDGE (ph) They get mad. 

00:36:15
ROMAN They get mad. 

00:36:15
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:36:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, sometimes they get... 

00:36:15
DORDGE (ph) Frustrated 

00:36:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:36:20
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... Uh...Huh... 

00:36:20
SHERI BAUMAN So that’s one way, but its not always the way that everybody satisfies they’re weak. Think of where everybody might be satisfied. If we know this we could probably save the world, what do you think? 

00:36:35
ROMAN (ph) Where everyone agrees on one thing. 

00:36:35
SHERI BAUMAN But sometimes that’s hard to do. 

00:36:40
ROMAN Yeah 

00:36:40
SHERI BAUMAN So when there is disagreement how can we, we said voting’s sometimes leaves the people who don’t win the vote feeling frustrated and angry. Any other ways we could solve differences? 

00:36:50
SAM STEEN Hmm... 

00:36:55
SHERI BAUMAN That’s a tough one. 

00:36:55
SAM STEEN I noticed that you all were talking to each other. 

00:37:00
DORDGE (ph) Talking out(ph) 

00:37:00
SAM STEEN Okay. 

00:37:00
DAIDGE (ph) We should manage to, not to talking, it's hard... 

00:37:00
SAM STEEN Oh, yeah 

00:37:00
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) that was a great idea. So do you think that if we had more time that you guys could have talked it out? 

00:37:10
ALEX Yeah. 

00:37:10
SHERI BAUMAN I agree that part of what made this one hard is that we didn’t give you really very much time. 

00:37:15
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh...Uh...Huh... 

00:37:15
SHERI BAUMAN So listen to the other person. Do you think sometimes you could have come up with a way to include everybody’s ideas even if they were different? 

00:37:25
ALEX (ph) It did. 

00:37:25
SHERI BAUMAN No or yes? 

00:37:30
SAM STEEN Daidge(ph) said that they did. 

00:37:30
DAIDGE (ph) We were all saying this is mine, this is mine, this is yours... 

00:37:35
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:37:35
SHERI BAUMAN So people got kind of… 

00:37:35
SAM STEEN Umm... 

00:37:35
SHERI BAUMAN …stuck on their own thing. Okay. 

00:37:40
SAM STEEN Well we’re about to end this session. 

00:37:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah any, anything else anyone wants to say about this process? Yes. 

00:37:45
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Umm... Can you take some of mine off because I have all six in my (inaudible ). 

00:37:52
SAM STEEN Hahaha... 

00:37:52
SHERI BAUMAN Ah... Well you guys can make that decision. 

00:37:55
SAM STEEN But I want to close with something, something that… 

00:37:55
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) there are some neat ones, aren’t here, yes. 

00:37:58
SAM STEEN Oh, but maybe we can, ah, just say something that, that you, that has surprised you. Something like that. Something that has surprised you so far about the first five sessions. Anything that surprised you. Go ahead. 

00:38:15
ROMAN (ph) Things that surprised me were like everyone talks about something they really think about. 

00:38:20
SAM STEEN That was a surprise for you? 

00:38:25
ROBIN Yeah, it’s like, they’re not shy to talk about anything they just let it out. 

00:38:25
SAM STEEN Ah... Good. Anybody else? 

00:38:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) It was good so far. 

00:38:40
SAM STEEN Hmm... 

00:38:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) t was was good so far. 

00:38:40
SAM STEEN So you’re surprised that it was good. 

00:38:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) mm... 

00:38:40
SHERI BAUMAN Hahaha... 

00:38:40
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:38:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I thought it would be like worse. 

00:38:50
SAM STEEN Yeah, not as fun or... 

00:38:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) h...Huh... 

00:38:55
SAM STEEN You're going to say boring, I saw your lips? Were you going to say boring? 

00:39:00
SHERI BAUMAN I’d this kind of surprised that everybody participated. I thought some people would be very shy to participate and everybody has been involved, so that’s been surprising to me. 

00:39:10
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:39:10
DORDGE (ph) I thought so... 

00:39:10
DAIDGE (ph) And we get to know each other very well. 

00:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN That’s true. So you guys know each other, we’re outsiders kind of we didn’t know. 

00:39:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I thought some people wanted to be here, they can come. 

00:39:25
SHERI BAUMAN Right, so that was the first place everybody made it and everybody was on time even though this was a new place. 

00:39:30
SAM STEEN Any surprises for you Alex(ph)? 

00:39:30
ALEX (ph) No. 

00:39:35
SAM STEEN No. 

00:39:35
ALEX (ph) I just had fun. 

00:39:35
SHERI BAUMAN Good. 

00:39:35
SAM STEEN You just had fun. 

00:39:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) y surprise is that I’m at the (inaudible ) 

00:39:40
SHERI BAUMAN Hahaha... 

00:39:40
SAM STEEN Don’t you what?. 

00:39:40
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ). 

00:39:42
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) t the (inaudible ) 

00:39:43
SAM STEEN Ah... Well we have one more session left. 

00:39:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and what I want you guys to think about between now and when we meet for the last time, is anything that we haven’t talked about anytime that you think would be really important so that you don’t leave thinking. I wish I’ve said this right which way have done that. And then ah, we have some things planned kind of to put it all together and for those of you who have a cultural ah, item that you brought to share with the group. Please bring it we’ll make some time to do that next time. Okay. 

00:40:20
SAM STEEN Okay see you next week 

00:40:25
See you next week 

00:40:30
Discussion 

00:40:35
SHERI BAUMAN Phew!!! 

00:40:35
SAM STEEN Hahaha... Well what you wanna start? 

00:40:40
SHERI BAUMAN Well, one place is I think I don’t know from where to start we definitely need to see how do we tie all this together... 

00:40:50
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:40:50
SHERI BAUMAN ...we only have one more session. 

00:40:50
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:40:50
SHERI BAUMAN But ah, but you think all the harmony and good will... 

00:40:55
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:40:55
SHERI BAUMAN ...and then we give them a task. 

00:41:00
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:41:00
SHERI BAUMAN And its, I, I did mean when I said I felt like we really didn’t give them enough time. 

00:41:05
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh...Uh...Huh... 

00:41:05
SHERI BAUMAN And so there was that added pressure. But what do you think about this session? 

00:41:10
SAM STEEN I think again it was realistic, umm, Roman(ph) made the point that we should be able to all get along and I guess the question wasn’t can we get along, but is it expected that we’ll always work together in harmony. So, I actually liked the conflict, because it may have been the very first time that there was one. 

00:41:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:41:30
SAM STEEN You think? 

00:41:30
SHERI BAUMAN But that my feeling is with one more session we can't really explore that and how to manage conflict and how? 

00:41:35
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... But I think they did. They said well even if you think about ah, Ileana's(ph) response about well, I think maybe I should take some of mine off to give someone else a chance. So she already began the process that maybe she you know wanted all of us only at first but then is thinking differently. I don't know. 

00:41:55
SHERI BAUMAN I don’t know I thought the (inaudible ) was as terrible. 

00:42:00
SAM STEEN Oh yeah, it was good, that was good. 

00:42:00
SHERI BAUMAN Girls are neat and boys are messy. Girls wanted to look red and boys wanted to so, as we talked about stereotypes. 

00:42:10
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:42:10
SHERI BAUMAN We... 

00:42:10
SAM STEEN We... 

00:42:10
SHERI BAUMAN ...you know they were aware 

00:42:10
SAM STEEN Yeah, but again and some of them I mean it's a stereotype but actually when Daidge(ph) said it, I was thinking great idea. 

00:42:15
SHERI BAUMAN Hahaha... 

00:42:15
SAM STEEN Just (inaudible ) on there you know. Hahaha... And, and Oligue(ph) too, he, he was tempted but back to the thing you were saying umm, there was a little bit of pressure with the time constraints and I think we all kind of agree that if there were more time, we might not they might not have had the same level of conflict. It would have been there but not at the same level. They may have been able to negotiate it. 

00:42:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right and I’m also observing the different ways people respond to that I see Roman(ph) as kind of a peacemaker. 

00:42:45
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:42:50
SHERI BAUMAN Ah... You know Dordge(ph) tends to (inaudible ) a bit 

00:42:52
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh...Uh...Huh... 

00:42:52
SHERI BAUMAN Ah... But its we’re not going to just have a chance on this group anyway... 

00:42:55
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:42:55
SHERI BAUMAN ...but that might be something we wanna share with the teachers or... 

00:43:00
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:43:00
SHERI BAUMAN ...with their counselor that’s our trades but... 

00:43:00
SAM STEEN But I didn’t see it I don't know about you. I didn’t see like on a scale of one to ten one being is not that bad and ten being its horrible. It, it’s that was minor. I think the fact that they have the conflict, I mean that the group was safe enough to actually again express... 

00:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN I agree... 

00:43:15
SAM STEEN ...how they really feel, you know... 

00:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:43:20
SAM STEEN ...and just deal with it and move on. 

00:43:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:43:20
SAM STEEN You know. What else? 

00:43:20
SHERI BAUMAN I’m just trying to think it was…Oh, I’m trying to remember their thoughts about the ending of the groups... 

00:43:35
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:43:35
SHERI BAUMAN ...it sounds like it has made an impact and there there is a sense of something good is coming to an end. 

00:43:40
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh...Uh...Huh...Uh...Huh... 

00:43:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ah... I’m glad. 

00:43:40
SAM STEEN I think it was good, we that you remember to bring that up. And that we allowed them to express their feelings and at first their feelings if you noticed they weren’t that they weren’t sad. They were something else like this is fun and then over time they begin to really share, well, I am a little bit sad that, that it may end. 

00:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN And I wanna be sure we address transfer to their real life… 

00:44:05
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:05
SHERI BAUMAN ...their bigger life at the end. You know based on this experience one might do differently at school. 

00:44:10
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... We talked about that, yeah. 

00:44:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right so we have to remember. 

00:44:10
SAM STEEN Absolutely 

00:44:15
SHERI BAUMAN So can we shift to how we, what we wanna to do in the last session? 

00:44:20
SAM STEEN Go ahead sure. 

00:44:20
SHERI BAUMAN Well some, some kids have brought something to share with the group... 

00:44:25
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN about their culture, so I think we definitely wanna provide that opportunity. 

00:44:30
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:35
SHERI BAUMAN And I think its best that it’s not a pressure. 

00:44:35
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:44:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ah... What else do we wanna be sure to do. 

00:44:40
SAM STEEN I know that there… you know we have to leave it open and end it enough that, is there anything you didn’t... 

00:44:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:44:45
SAM STEEN ...share or ask that you wanna ask or share, your last comment about what are some of your thoughts of what you can do and take back with you when you leave here and then the other one which is a nice activity, I’m sorry was, ah, the, the (inaudible ). 

00:45:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right, which we have and I think, we still wanna... 

00:45:05
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:05
SHERI BAUMAN ...definitely wanna do those and I think it would be interesting sort of again as a group activity to let them suggest the very final thing whether its and we might give a clue whether they wanna give high fives or... 

00:45:15
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:15
...some way to express their appreciation if that’s what they’re feeling... 

00:45:20
SAM STEEN Uh...Huh... 

00:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN ...towards each other. What do you think? 

00:45:25
SAM STEEN I thought that’s what they were doing with the cards. 

00:45:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well that would be to an individual, but to the group their sense of… 

00:45:30
SAM STEEN You can open it up and see what they say. 

00:45:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. Okay, well.

SHERI BAUMAN Sam do you wanna tell you what you would have brought... 

00:50:05
SAM STEEN Well 

00:50:05
SHERI BAUMAN ...if you would haven’t remembered. 

00:50:05
SAM STEEN You know I was trying to think of a cultural item and I ah, the only thing I could think of it its it was a picture that I had, that's, it’s very meaningful to me and I’m not really sure if you could say it’s a cultural item, but what I like about it is that it’s a picture of my great grandmother, who lived to be 93, my grandmother was in the picture. My mother was in the picture and as well as my wife. So it were like three or four different generations. And just for all of them to be in that same picture particularly now that my great grandmother has passed away it’s just a really meaningful picture for me. And also now having a daughter who wasn’t born at that time but I could just imagine her being in that picture as well and sort off representing just a part of my family and another generation. 

00:51:00
SHERI BAUMAN What did you say you brought something too? 

00:51:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ah, just a song 

00:51:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah let me hear. Would you share with us? You wanna tell us about the song?

00:51:25
SHERI BAUMAN Wonderful 

00:51:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ahh ahh okay okay 

00:51:35
SAM STEEN You might have to pass that around 

00:51:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) No, it’s just a clear song. 

00:51:45

00:52:30
SHERI BAUMAN It is a kids. 

00:52:30
(inaudible ) 

00:52:35
SHERI BAUMAN Thank you. We know even if you didn’t find anything for today you might start thinking about what culture means in your family and remember that culture can be language it can be food it can be music it can be rituals things that you do over and over again or traditions or stories sometimes for example I have a Korean friend who was telling me that in Korean families when a baby reaches the age of 100 days they have a big celebration and that when they reach the age of a year they do this very interesting thing it’s called (inaudible ) and I don’t never having been there just ahh telling you what she shared with me. But they could out of bunch of different things on a table and the baby gets to look at them all and pick them and what they pick is supposed to be expressing the kind of life they’re gonna have so like if the child picks up a book they’re gonna be a very good student or if they pick up a golf club or you know something athletic they’re gonna be an athlete or if they pick up a piece of jeweler they’re gonna be very wealthy so that’s a little custom that they have on the child’s one year birthday and I asked my friend did your daughter do this and I said what did she pick up and guess what? She picked up everything. So they said she’s gonna have everything. 

00:54:10
ROMAN (ph) I was just gonna guess. 

00:54:10
SHERI BAUMAN You gonna guess what did you think? 

00:54:15
ROMAN (ph) I was gonna guess I should picked up the jewellery. 

00:54:15
SAM STEEN Hmmm.... 

00:54:15
SHERI BAUMAN All that she turned out to be wealthy. I guess she just grabbed everything so she was gonna be so it may be that you don’t know now but this will be the time to ask people in your family where sometimes you mentioned that your dad makes kimchi or likes kimchi may be there’s a recipe that’s been handed down in your family from one generation to another that you might wanna keep up when you are in the (inaudible ). Those kinds of things. So… 

00:54:45
SAM STEEN Was, was there anything that someone wanted to share that they now after thinking about it what they could have brought? I know it was hard it was even hard for me. You know. (inaudible ) 

00:55:00
Hmm 

00:55:00
SAM STEEN Okay, okay well lets move on. Is it okay if we move on. You know as we are coming to the close ahh we wanna make sure that we give you all the opportunity to ask questions of each other that may be you haven’t asked thus far.

SAM STEEN Oh I was just going to ask that one question about you know out of all the things we’ve talked about the past six sessions which one has been like the most not necessarily uncomfortable but it could be uncomfortable but the one that was the most important to you. The one that you think you’ll remember you know once we leave. You can begin Alex(ph). 

01:01:00
ALEX (ph) Ahhh session four 

01:01:00

01:01:28
ALEX (ph) yeah 

01:01:28
SAM STEEN …okay so that’s what we did and why was it important to you? 

01:01:30
ALEX (ph) Because it talks about like ahh like how do you feel when people call you names… 

01:01:35
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:01:40
ALEX (ph) and tease you. 

01:01:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And now what do you think before… 

01:01:40
SAM STEEN It is not only how you feel… 

01:01:40
So we can help them out. 

01:01:40
SAM STEEN but also how other feels so that you can help them. All right. (inaudible ) 

01:01:49
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I wasn’t mixing with everyone. 

01:01:50
SAM STEEN Okay that was the most important thing and why was that the case? 

01:01:55
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Because when I was little like in kinder ahhh my people used to tease me. 

01:02:00
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:02:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) (inaudible ) 

01:02:05
SAM STEEN It was important to oh it reminded you of some things you’ve already dealt with. Thanks Ileana(ph) 

01:02:10
Yes 

01:02:10
SAM STEEN Go. 

01:02:10
ROMAN (ph) I think the comfort circle because you actually describe how you’re feeling at that time. 

01:02:20
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:02:20
ROMAN (ph) Either if you like feeling like you’ve taking a risk or that you’re really comfortable with everything. 

01:02:25
SAM STEEN uh huh uh huh. So it's a good visual for you? uh huh Oligue(ph)? 

01:02:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ahh session three because did care after being bullied by fifth or sixth graders. 

01:02:40
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:02:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And now if I get bullied by someone older than me I, I know what to do. 

01:02:45
SAM STEEN Hmm that’s good to hear. 

01:02:45
SHERI BAUMAN You know it’s interesting that so many of you’ve mentioned as meaningful the session that was really hard. 

01:02:50
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:02:50
SHERI BAUMAN So you’ve got lots of courage in you taking things with you that are not so easy. 

01:02:55
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:02:55
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) Alex? 

01:03:00
ALEX (ph) (inaudible ). 

01:03:05
SAM STEEN Well before we answer end till then lets Daidge(ph) you don’t want to share anything? What about Dordge(ph) ? 

01:03:10
Hmm I’d like to say number three. 

01:03:15
SAM STEEN Same one? 

01:03:15
Yeah 

01:03:15
SAM STEEN Why was it important to you? 

01:03:20
DORDGE (ph) Because it teaches all teaches us not to say those words to other kids and it might hurt their feelings… 

01:03:25
SAM STEEN uh huh. 

01:03:30
Oligue(ph)? 

01:03:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I also liked session one because we gotto know each other more… 

01:03:35
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:03:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …than we do at school. 

01:03:35
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:03:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) and we got to know (inaudible ) 

01:03:45
hmmm Ileana(ph) 

01:03:45
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I likes session two because we had to do a lot of entertaining things. 

01:03:50
SAM STEEN Also those activities… 

01:03:50
SHERI BAUMAN oh yeah 

01:03:50
SAM STEEN …were fun 

01:03:50
SHERI BAUMAN …that was sort of which we’re knowing. 

01:03:50
SAM STEEN Well yeah and (inaudible ) Daidge(ph) 

01:03:55
DAIDGE (ph) I liked session five because it showed us the difference what we’ve had that are the same with people or different 

01:04:00
SAM STEEN Ohhh… 

01:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN And that we both had some of those right we don’t like and … 

01:04:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) There is a session I forgot number four 

01:04:10
SAM STEEN uh huh it is almost as if you liked them on whole but the more salient one the most important one was number three it sounds like … 

01:04:15
uh huh 

01:04:15
SAM STEEN And then you were like for a lot of people you liked them, what about you Sheri (inaudible ) 

01:04:22
SHERI BAUMAN Well that one ago, the most intense reaction from me. 

01:04:25
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:04:30
SHERI BAUMAN It was hard for me to, to think about some of those things and I was also so impressed that everybody really was willing to feel those hard things. 

01:04:40
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:04:40
SHERI BAUMAN And you Mr. Sam? 

01:04:40
SAM STEEN I think mine honestly this is unfair for me to says but they were all very meaningful to me. And I’ve told this to Sheri just your willingness to really share how you feel and you all weren’t acting you weren’t, you weren’t pretending you were really telling us how you felt. Take for example the session where I would say it was the first conflict that we had between the girls and the boys and but nonetheless you still you really you really weren’t able to share how you felt. And it doesn’t look like you all have a problem with each other. You’re still friends. 

01:05:20
uh huh 

01:05:20
SAM STEEN So… I think that will be end 

01:05:20
SHERI BAUMAN I wanna mention some things since we’re talking about things that I loved the way you guys come up with little games and things even in between sessions 

01:05:30
SAM STEEN uh huh uh huh 

01:05:30
SHERI BAUMAN …and come up with good activities to keep everybody involved and energized that’s been real fun and I liked doing silly things that we all started to do. Oligue(ph)… 

01:05:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) What was number four? 

01:05:40
SHERI BAUMAN Number four was walking in someone else’s shoes remember? 

01:05:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Oh 

01:05:45
Oh yeah 

01:05:45
ALEX The… like the… 

01:05:45
when we walking 

01:05:50
SAM STEEN Walking... 

01:05:50
ALEX Like it’s going to the birthday party. 

01:05:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right 

01:05:50
Oh yeah 

01:05:55
SAM STEEN How do you feel and what do you do? So we don’t wanna leave you there we wanna… what are you gonna do in the future? 

01:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah 

01:06:00
SAM STEEN What are you gonna say? 

01:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN So you went through six weeks of a special group to appreciate the ways that we are all different in our different cultures and the ways that we are all the same. And not to make judgments and so forth what I want to know is how you gonna be or act or think differently after this experience when you get back to school and everything is just as it was before. What do you think might be a way that that you could use what we did in this group in your life? 

01:06:30
ROMAN (ph) Well if someone is like making fun of someone after this session I understand how they pretty much feel so I’d actually stand up for them. 

01:06:40
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right 

01:06:45
SAM STEEN hmmm 

01:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody else? 

01:06:50
SAM STEEN So it sounds like you feel prepared to stand up for them uh huh 

01:06:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Same thing. 

01:06:55
SAM STEEN Same thing 

01:06:55
SHERI BAUMAN Alex(ph) 

01:07:00
ALEX But ahh well if someone’s like being (inaudible ) and you’re right there just walk away (inaudible ) someone else. 

01:07:07
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:07:10
SHERI BAUMAN SO it sounds like some of the things you’re thinking about are ways to respond when people are say cruel or discriminatory things. What about getting to know someone? What do you think you might lets say a, a new kid starts to school and you’ve sort off thought about their shoes, they look different. What might you do differently after we’ve been. 

01:07:30
(inaudible ) tell him I’m not your school. 

01:07:31
SHERI BAUMAN And why would that be helpful do you think? 

01:07:35
ILLIANA (ph) Because if I was walking their shoes like (inaudible ) 

01:07:40
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:07:40
SHERI BAUMAN I don’t see… 

01:07:40
ALEX you can you can ask them even if you if they want to play. 

01:07:45
DAIDGE (ph) (inaudible ) 

01:07:50
SHERI BAUMAN You could what? 

01:07:50
How many did this. 

01:07:50
SHERI BAUMAN Do you like? 

01:07:50
DAIDGE (ph) hmmm 

01:07:55
SHERI BAUMAN Like how new. 

01:07:55
DAIDGE (ph) Since the beginning. 

01:07:55
SHERI BAUMAN oh 

01:07:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) When we were playing the name game we got mixed to help with our names 

01:08:00
SHERI BAUMAN uh huh 

01:08:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) But now it’s so much easy. 

01:08:05
SHERI BAUMAN So how did you feel to be the new kid? 

01:08:10
DAIDGE (ph) The same I’ve been to a lot of new schools like three or four times. 

01:08:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh boy! 

01:08:15
DAIDGE (ph) Well my parents have to (inaudible ). 

01:08:16
SHERI BAUMAN So that (inaudible ) do things. 

01:08:18
DAIDGE (ph) uh huh 

01:08:20
SHERI BAUMAN I think that would be difficult to start a new school and not know anybody. So have you learnt how to make friends? 

01:08:25
DAIDGE (ph) hmm 

01:08:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah looks like it looks like your friends right here. 

01:08:30
DAIDGE (ph) uh huh 

01:08:30
SHERI BAUMAN for you. 

01:08:30
SAM STEEN And did you know when you go back to the to the school some of your other classmates haven’t had this sort of an experience. Right? 

01:08:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) We can teach them. 

01:08:45
SAM STEEN So it’s… maybe you can teach them right hmmm. 

01:08:45
SHERI BAUMAN So I’m I just as usual I’m thinking back and I had instead of where you are but in terms of walking in someone’s shoes a lot of you said you’ve been at the same school since early in… 

01:09:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah so could you imagine Daidge(ph) going to three or four different schools can you imagine walking in his shoes and… 

01:09:05
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:09:05
SHERI BAUMAN how how starting all over again and not knowing anybody would be hard can you? 

01:09:15
ROMAN (ph) Yeah 

01:09:15
SAM STEEN But he I see them as he's good at it. 

01:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah 

01:09:20
SAM STEEN He can tell he can make friends easily. He did it here and some of the things that you’ve shared it was very evident that you’re able to do that easily. Won’t you agree with that Daidge(ph)? 

01:09:30
uh huh 

01:09:35
SHERI BAUMAN So I think the time is come that we’re actually going to say goodbye this is going to be the end. And I’m wondering how we’d like to that differently. Sometimes people say goodbye it was nice knowing you. Sometimes they do some things sometimes they wave as they go out. What would you like to do? 

01:09:50
ROMAN (ph) If we can like offer our hands together like in a big circle and like say our group name. 

01:09:55
SHERI BAUMAN Oh good idea. Anybody else? 

01:10:00
(crosstalk) 

01:10:00
SAM STEEN Oh I guess we might want to negotiate that first and what’s the next? Let someone threw out backgrounds and you all suggest and then we said we make sure that’s what you want. We heard cultural different backgrounds a couple of times so which one… 

01:10:15
Different backgrounds 

01:10:15
Different backgrounds. 

01:10:15
SAM STEEN Is it just backgrounds or different backgrounds? 

01:10:20
Different backgrounds 

01:10:20
SAM STEEN So you say backgrounds and… 

01:10:20
Different 

01:10:20
SAM STEEN A few of you say different backgrounds. What’s the difference? 

01:10:25
ALEX (ph) Because we all don’t have the same backgrounds 

01:10:25
SAM STEEN uh huh right. So you had different to make sure that we know it’s different. If you just say backgrounds does that mean that they’re all the same? 

01:10:40
I don’t know. 

01:10:40
SAM STEEN hmm I didn’t hear you what you said? 

01:10:45
SHERI BAUMAN So we’re gonna decide which it is? 

01:10:50
Different 

01:10:50
Different 

01:10:50
Different 

01:10:50
Different 

01:10:50
Different 

01:10:50
(inaudible ). 

01:10:55
SAM STEEN Illiana(ph) I think who else was more than just Illiana(ph) that said background… 

01:11:00
Illiana(ph) (inaudible ) 

01:11:05
SAM STEEN Okay 

01:11:05
No I said different 

01:11:05
SAM STEEN You said different. when do you hardly own more than one person (inaudible ) so it’s up to you if you are comfortable with different backgrounds and… 

01:11:15
That’s fun. 

01:11:15
SAM STEEN You’re okay with that? 

01:11:15
SHERI BAUMAN So Roman(ph) explain how we’re gonna do it? 

01:11:20
ROMAN (ph) It’s just like put all our hands on top of each other and just like yell out our names. 

01:11:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay 

01:11:25
SAM STEEN Oh like different backgrounds 

01:11:25
Yeah 

01:11:25
SAM STEEN Oh like if you’re on the same thing. 

01:11:25
Yeah 

01:11:25
SAM STEEN Oh okay is that is that okay? 

01:11:30
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) team so you’re gonna show me how to do it? 

01:11:31
SAM STEEN Shall we stand up 

01:11:31
SHERI BAUMAN Can we stand up? 

01:11:35
ROMAN (ph) Yeah 

01:11:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay 

01:11:35
SAM STEEN They do normally put the shortest person in the middle you know. 

01:11:40
SHERI BAUMAN And then we do like this… 

01:11:40
SAM STEEN (inaudible ) like one two three or something like that? 

01:11:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh… 

01:11:45
SAM STEEN I think (inaudible ) Illiana(ph) as she was willing to you know change the name would you agree? can you say one two three… 

01:11:55
 Let me say it from backwards 

01:11:55
SHERI BAUMAN Great 

01:11:55
One two three. 

01:12:00
Different backgrounds 

01:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah 

01:12:00
SAM STEEN Yeah 

01:12:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay 

01:12:10
Discussion 

01:12:15
SAM STEEN What do you think? 

01:12:15
SHERI BAUMAN Well I looked at their evaluations and its really interesting. Because they’re just about all tens in the last session. So in the first session that was not the case at all. We had some one’s, two’s and they’re all over the place. So from their perspective it sounds like they’ve learnt things and felt included 

01:12:35
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN And respected and so forth. 

01:12:40
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN So I guess my disappointment wasn’t that they didn’t bring cultural things but they didn’t feel like they have them I hope we planted a seed that will inspire them to live more into that. 

01:12:55
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:12:55
SHERI BAUMAN I even heard one of them you could say (inaudible ) culture 

01:13:00
SAM STEEN uh huh… uh huh 

01:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN And yet the could identify culturally so its... 

01:13:00
SAM STEEN uh huh it is… 

01:13:05
SHERI BAUMAN Suggest to me that six weeks wasn’t enough to really work with the… 

01:13:10
SAM STEEN Yeah 

01:13:10
SHERI BAUMAN …it would be so interesting to work with. 

01:13:10
SAM STEEN But do you also familiar(ph) with some other research about forging a cultural identity 

01:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN uh huh 

01:13:15
SAM STEEN Some of the research of Jean Phinney. 

01:13:20
SHERI BAUMAN uh huh 

01:13:20
SAM STEEN It doesn’t really come about until they’re 13 or 14 and there are couple of years before that. Ahh so I wonder if that also played a part that this is just pretty typical that at that stage may be they can identify who they are but in terms of trying to connect to something that would represent their culture may have been more challenging. 

01:13:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right although we didn’t ask them to chat with their parents 

01:13:45
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN so whether they had… 

01:13:45
SAM STEEN oh then 

01:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN …their conversations 

01:13:45
SAM STEEN or not 

01:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN or whether this is a reflection of that but that’s, that’s just something to think about 

01:13:50
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:13:50
SHERI BAUMAN and and to work with. ahh 

01:13:50
SAM STEEN That’s true 

01:13:50
SHERI BAUMAN In future 

01:13:55
SAM STEEN …but it didn’t detract from 

01:13:55
SHERI BAUMAN Not at all 

01:13:55
SAM STEEN You know what I mean? It didn’t it didn’t detracted and ahh yeah 

01:14:00
SHERI BAUMAN And I thought some of their takeaway lessons were really valuable. 

01:14:05
SAM STEEN uh huh I liked the one all they pointed out about teaching other people... 

01:14:10
SHERI BAUMAN uh huh 

01:14:10
SAM STEEN You know and you wonder that’s not going to be an easy task but the fact that he recognized it. 

01:14:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right even if they have the thought… 

01:14:15
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:14:20
SHERI BAUMAN And there earlier suggestions about seeing their counselors, the resource I mean I think they saw adult as a resource so in general ah I thought it went well. 

01:14:30
SAM STEEN I think so. Did you notice any other body language when it was coming to an end? 

01:14:35
SHERI BAUMAN No I think my own body language was… 

01:14:40
SAM STEEN Which part… 

01:14:40
SHERI BAUMAN …coming to end. 

01:14:40
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha… 

01:14:40
No, what did you see? 

01:14:40
SAM STEEN Well, I just saw one. Umm….I think it was Alex. She really did look sad. You know and Illiana as well, I don't know she, she looked like she was about to cry and umm… I don't know, it just was, it's not unusual, you know the groups… 

01:14:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right 

01:14:55
SAM STEEN ...Ending and it's very, it's amazing how connected and close people become in such a short period of time. But that activity that Roman(ph) came up with kinda was empowering you know that we could all join together and… 

01:15:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah…they were willing to… 

01:15:15
SAM STEEN Pretty… 

01:15:15
SHERI BAUMAN Takes, take risks… 

01:15:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:15:15
SHERI BAUMAN And I think they recognized that. It was also really interesting to me that even though they found the session difficult… 

01:15:25
SAM STEEN Hmm… 

01:15:25
SHERI BAUMAN …challenging, emotional, most of them identified that is the most valuable. 

01:15:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:15:30
SHERI BAUMAN So, it's a sort of trust to process and trust the kids. 

01:15:35
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:15:35
SHERI BAUMAN You know, we were unsure about doing that. 

01:15:35
SAM STEEN Great. 

01:15:35
SHERI BAUMAN And how to do it. 

01:15:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:15:35
SHERI BAUMAN And whether that was too intense… 

01:15:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:15:40
SHERI BAUMAN And, and yet they, they obviously recognized the values. So that's, that's something to keep in mind I think for us. 

01:15:50
SAM STEEN Absolutely. 

01:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN That they took it (inaudible ) with it and in some ways that was a tipping point. 

01:15:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:15:55
SHERI BAUMAN You know, once they felt, they could take that risk together. 

01:16:00
SAM STEEN uh huh that its easier to do the other ones. 

01:16:00
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And I just loved watching their little individual personalities 

01:16:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:16:05
SHERI BAUMAN Began to be clearer and clearer as we do this… 

01:16:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:16:10
SHERI BAUMAN and Daidge's(ph) comment at the end and I thought was really important that he's been to so many schools. 

01:16:15
SAM STEEN uh huh. Do you think, this is the last question I have. Do you think that they feel empowered either within themselves umm… or about the group. 

01:16:30
SHERI BAUMAN I, my hunch is that they do at this moment and it's sort of like a vaccine, but it needs boosters. 

01:16:35
SAM STEEN Umm… 

01:16:40
SHERI BAUMAN And you know, I hope that either they take the initiative or their school recognizes that they have something… 

01:16:45
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN …to offer 

01:16:45
SAM STEEN uh huh uh huh 

01:16:45
SHERI BAUMAN and gives them a chance to get those boosters and get some reinforcement for trying to put these things in practice. So, I think that's… 

01:16:55
SAM STEEN Hmm… 

01:16:55
SHERI BAUMAN Really useful. I want to take a minute and reflect again on now that we've done this whole about how we worked as co-leaders. 

01:17:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:17:05
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think? What struck you as our Strengths… 

01:17:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:17:15
SHERI BAUMAN As co-leaders or… 

01:17:15
SAM STEEN Well, we talked about the strengths throughout. So, it's a umm… our styles, they, there, they complement each other and umm… we both umm… were willing to time in. You, you understand what I mean like… 

01:17:30
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

01:17:35
SAM STEEN And not worry like occasionally, I would say I don't wanna cut you off, but it if needed to be said say it. I think we both did a good job of picking upon body language and trying to draw people in or students in when they weren't engaged and I think that this processing part really helps. 

01:17:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh me too. 

01:17:50
SAM STEEN You know, what I mean just so that we know where we're coming from and where we're going. 

01:17:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I have to say what a luxury it is to have a co-leader 

01:18:00
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:18:00
SHERI BAUMAN ...because groups are so complex 

01:18:00
SAM STEEN uh huh... 

01:18:00
SHERI BAUMAN with all the different, you know there is another pair of eyes 

01:18:05
SAM STEEN Oh…yeah… 

01:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN And another pair of ears and another perception and be able to, 

01:18:10
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN …to say I don't know, we were going to do this, but… 

01:18:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN I'm not so sure, it's okay. So… 

01:18:15
SAM STEEN And I wonder if there weaker things we could improve on… what would you think? And I couldn't think any I'm just wondering maybe if you had any. 

01:18:25
SHERI BAUMAN You know, I feel pretty good about that part. I was a little nervous, because as I said although, we both felt confident that our styles and our beliefs were similar. You never know… 

01:18:35
SAM STEEN You never know.. 

01:18:35
SHERI BAUMAN Until you’re, never in there, so… I felt, I felt good about it. I would do this again. 

01:18:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:18:40
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ) hear beat. 

01:18:45
SAM STEEN And that you, and, and go on back slightly, you're saying, I wish. You were saying you know somehow connecting them to their some assets in the school and I wish there was a way that we can check in with them, you know, six months later or you know a year later just to see. I don’t know how realistic it is but just the fact that, umm… if we could do that, that'll will be great. 

01:19:00
SHERI BAUMAN And maybe we can take advantage of technology 

01:19:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:19:05
SHERI BAUMAN And ask their counselor if we can send emails to… 

01:19:05
SAM STEEN or something… Uh…Huh… 

01:19:05
SHERI BAUMAN …different backgrounds. So even though it's interesting, I you know there are, their questions of each other… 

01:19:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:19:15
SHERI BAUMAN …were very superficial in… 

01:19:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:19:15
SHERI BAUMAN …some ways, but I guess I'm judging I'm not … 

01:19:20
SAM STEEN Great. 

01:19:20
SHERI BAUMAN …11 years old in 5th grade… 

01:19:25
SAM STEEN Right, right 

01:19:25
SHERI BAUMAN Birthdays and numbers are important to them. 

01:19:25
SAM STEEN uh huh 

01:19:25
SHERI BAUMAN So.. 

01:19:25
SAM STEEN But it also may signify you know how within the group… 

01:19:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:19:30
SAM STEEN The life of a group… 

01:19:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:19:30
SAM STEEN You know, we have that peak and now we're kinda of coming down and… 

01:19:35
SHERI BAUMAN Disengaging a little bit… 

01:19:35
SAM STEEN A little bit… and … 

01:19:35
SHERI BAUMAN Getting them broom… 

01:19:40
SAM STEEN Right… 

01:19:40
SHERI BAUMAN …safer 

01:19:40
SAM STEEN What if they would've opened up all of these things, you know we, we would've needed…. 

01:19:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:19:40
SAM STEEN ….another two or three sessions. 

01:19:45
SHERI BAUMAN And we gave them, we gave them some opportunities. We gave a (inaudible ) I thought that my question to you and Dordge(ph). 

01:19:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:19:55
SHERI BAUMAN …was, wasn't sort of thing you ask typically, but wasn't you know… 

01:20:00
SAM STEEN The way off the thoughts. 

01:20:00
SHERI BAUMAN Right. So… 

01:20:00
SAM STEEN And Dordge(ph) loved it. 

01:20:00
SHERI BAUMAN Really? 

01:20:05
SAM STEEN Yes she did. She, (inaudible ) and she, she enjoyed answering that question. 

01:20:06
SHERI BAUMAN Oh… Good. 

01:20:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:20:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I feel very good about this and I can tell that kids did and I really appreciate this chance to work with you. 

01:20:15
SAM STEEN And the feeling is mutual and hopefully, if the opportunity presents itself, we'll take full advantage of it. 

01:20:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:20:25
SAM STEEN Okay, ha…ha…ha. 

01:20:30
