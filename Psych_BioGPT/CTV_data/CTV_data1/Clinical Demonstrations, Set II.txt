00:00:15
BERNHARD TRENKLE So, uh, first, I will give a brief introduction about the history, about how this approach has developed. So, originally, I was studying economic engineering, um, and making my internship in banks, in the Central Bank. Already, at this time, I was feeling something is wrong with banking, uh, perhaps not, perhaps not so wrong profession for me for the rest of my life, so I started to read psychology books, and thought I should change business, and especially, I was reading a lot of books of a famous family therapist Ernst Schering. He was, at this time, teaching at the National Institute of Mental Health, here, uh, in USA. I was reading everything, what he has written, um, and then, accidentally, I heard he is coming back to Germany and taking a professorship in Heidelberg, and this was giving the last thing that I changed business. Schering was very surprised to find a new student, first semester, who has read everything he has written, so he supported me. Everybody in Heidelberg wanted to make family therapy, suddenly, because he was a very good presenter, and I was knowing how to do it because I was reading everything. So, many people wanted me as a co-therapist, so I practically started immediately doing therapy in the child and adolescent psychiatry at university clinic. Many years in co-therapy. Later, they allowed me to work alone, even when I was not finishing my studying. And then, accidentally, I was getting a shop at univ-, at the Speech Department. It was a little bit of problem because I have had, myself, a stuttering problem. I will present later, um, about stuttering with () from South Africa. And so, I was suddenly confronted with adult stutters, have no idea how to do therapy with them, but from all my experience from using family therapy and from '79 I was knowing Jeffrey Zeig, and we invited Zeig, illegally, into Heidelberg. I was convinced I heal everybody. Um, uh, but with adult stutters, in the first year, without cancellations of therapies from the stutters. I have no significant results, um, and everybody canceled and have not did more than few sessions, and it was somehow strange they have three teaching speech therapists and three clinical speech therapists and gave me, as a beginner, the adult stutters. Nobody was brave enough to work with them, and they thought "He is so confident, maybe.." ah, yeah, it, and they gave me the voice disorder people. In the psychoanalytic literature, they describe them as perfectionists, um, uh, very dominant , uh, very, uh, resistant, and these people have been coming to clinics, they want to have a pill, they want to have a medical treatment, and suddenly they are sitting in front of a psychologist. 

00:04:00

00:04:00
BERNHARD TRENKLE This way. They do not wanted to have therapy, they pos-, one has said, "If I wanted to have therapy, I would go to the psychosomatic clinic and not to the ear, nose and throat clinic. Um, and the professor said I should use 'relaxation techniques,' deep relaxation techniques,' and you have learned it. So, I was not calling it hypnosis at this stage, it would even created more problems with these dominant people. I called it deep relaxation technique, but still, say it was, nobody wanted, really, to work with me from these people. Um, and so one, uh, patient had told me, "If I have to close the eyes and you look at me, it's impossible for me to relax." And that was the first time I was doing what I will present, uh, today. So, I thought I accept it, I go with the patient. I'm pacing it, I said, "Okay." So we change the situation, we sit parallel. "I will explain how you can do self-hypnosis, and then I will demonstrate it. You can use me as a role model and can just go with me," and that was acceptable. I was not working with her, I was speaking in this direction, not looking, uh, at her. Also, in the meantime, I have been looking for a story, I was looking through many storybooks. Is there a story which is somehow mirroring this resistance: Uh, "Please treat me, make me healthy. I need my voice for my profession. I'm, uh, but I have no problem. I have a voice problem, but I have no problem. Um, so, treat me, but do not treat me, somehow." So I was looking for a story and, in a book, of a, of (), a Sufi teacher living in England, I found a story, which is probably one thousand years old, from Persia, from, uh, uh, Afghanistan region, which was somehow reflecting the problems these people have. And, with this first patient, she was very surprised, I was surprised how deep relaxed she was. She was telling me, "I tried many things. I tried, uh, meditation. I tried, uh, uh, other Chinese training. I tried yoga. Uh, I was not being able before to relax." I, she was one with herself, how deeply relaxed she was, so I was doing it more and more, and, in the meantime, I do this with every patient. Also, when I call it 'coaching' when I work with business people, or with sports people, we call it 'mental training,' um, and I use, basically, this approach, but because I have told this story of the lion, uh, which I found in this book, around 1983, I have told this several thousand times, I think. In the meantime, I can modify the story, so that is the reason why in my description it said you can also use it for group therapy. Um, so I'm now knowing this story so well, that I can ask, in my training group, I can do this in German, but not in English, um, I can ask four, five, sometimes six people, "Please give me a problem, give me a goal" and I write it down, and then I work with the whole group and then I, everybody's hearing the same story, but at the same time, um, I am addressing for mostly four people, if I have a good day, five or six, um, people differently and later, I ask, "Do you, do you remember at what time in the story you had been addressed and what was happening?" Sometimes, people have amnesia and the other people have said "yeah, I have hearing, it was this person," and so it's somehow also a good idea to tell the same story many times, and to modify it. So, the basic story you can tell so good, you can tell it with one brain, with, uh, uh, one brain hemisphere. You can do it automatically, and with the other part, you can concentrate to individualize the story to address the individual goal. Um, and when I address different people, in, in a group therapy, or in a group situation, I may lead two training groups, I'm speaking in the direction of these people, where they are sitting, and I'm using words they have used to describe the problem. I am using words they have used to describe their goal. So, say, if you're in trance, you can hear if I speak in this direction or if I speak in this direction. Maybe not, when you have loud speakers all around, but if you speak with no amplification, with 20, 25 people, you hear this, in which direction I speak, and then, if I use the words of the people, usually people, unconsciously, with rapid eye movements or with a change in the breathe pattern, you could see how they are reacting, now that you are addressing them personally, uh, but, uh today I will show the basic approach, and I, soon, will need a demonstration patient. Um, and, maybe somebody here who has a chronic pain problem? Ah, several of, okay, because I have to tell, uh, before, before I start, a famous Nobel Prize winner in Physics, Niels Bohr, he was asked by a student, "What is opposite to be precise?" and he said, "To be clear." You can find the story in, uh, the teaching seminar of Jeffrey Zeig, right in the beginning. What is opposite to be precise is being clear. I needed long meditation time to understand what he is meaning. But, when you are, when you are doing a live demonstration with his approach, who has a relatively clear manual, when you want to teach a clear structure, and sometimes, um, yeah, when I was teaching this EMDR technique, um, I was one of the first who was knowing this in Germany, uh, early, uh, and so even, even the hypnosis training asked me, "Can you show us? Everybody is speaking about it." So, I was explaining, briefly, and then I asked does somebody have such flashback thing from a car accident or a sport accident. I do not have the time to demonstrate all my therapy, here, I just want to demonstrate the technique. Then somebody was sitting here, and after five sessions, I was knowing good technique, but wrong patient. And there, I have the dilemma of being precise and clear. If I want to be directly clear, and just demonstrate the technique, it's not fitting to the problem of the patient, but everybody is seeing the technique, which I have made the explanation. If I make real therapy, I lose the clearness, I go away from EMDR, I demonstrate something complete different what we are talking about. It's good therapy, it's precise. So here, I mainly want to present the technique, so that's the reason I am suggesting does somebody have a pain problem, so I just, I have worked a lot with pain patients too. So, um, I can demonstrate mainly what, how I teach a patient, who has pain problems, but also has a voice disorder or stuttering patient, or mental training patient. The basic approach is the same. The story I tell is always the same, but I will include in the story, then this time, some, few pain techniques, additionally, so you can see how I modify, modify the original story, uh, and include some of the pain techniques. Um, so what, what kind of pain problem we have here? 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN Back. Back and hip. 

00:13:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE Back and hip. It's chronic? 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN It's a little bit chronic. 

00:13:30
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Tendonitis of the heel, or foot. 

00:13:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE What is this? 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Tendonitis of the heel, or foot. 

00:13:40
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay, okay. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Back pain and neck. 

00:13:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE Back, uh, the back pain and neck pain, um, it's chronic? Long time? 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN 11 years. 

00:14:00
BERNHARD TRENKLE Oh. You have did already something with hypnosis? 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Uh, not much. 

00:14:05
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. You would like to come? That is something I have, uh, so I need somebody who helps her. Actually, I had a long lasting cold, the longest lasting in my life, and I still have voice problems. I wanted to speak about voice disorder, but not demonstrate it today, so. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:30
BERNHARD TRENKLE So they have brought me some hot water, so I hope it will... 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE Tomorrow, I will do a workshop on how I use this technique, also, with anxiety, with phobia, and with panic attack patients. And, the handouts, on the home page of the Erickson Foundation, you will find several pages handout of what I'm doing this morning, so you, you can, I will do the demonstration with her, but I think it might be more interesting for you if you also go into a nice trance. It makes not much sense to write this down; you will find it on the home page. The outline, the lion, the lion story, and the brief version of how I have found it many years ago. A long version, very long version, a little bit longer, probably than what I do, not the pain control techniques, some other problems are in it, um, but you will have 90 percent of what I'm doing, here, you will have as a handout, okay? So, can you, um, define a goal? What would be your goal? Minimum goal and a maximum goal? 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Uh, maximum, to be pain free. Minimum, uh, better functioning, because, since my feet have started hurting and they're, that limits my life, a lot. 

00:16:15
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. And, what kind of pain you have, in the? 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Ah, it's just, uh, a burning up in here, and lack of movement. Low back, and into the hips, and then my feet just hurt all the time. 

00:16:30
BERHARD TRENKLE And what the doctors are saying what you should do, or, what does? 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Um, I've done surgery for discs, like, laser surgery, and physical therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE What was, what was, at least, temporarily help, or what have helped you, what is helpful? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Um, it's better with movement. It's worse when I'm sitting, when I'm still, when I'm in a bumpy car. Ice helps, uh... 

00:17:10
BERNHARD TRENKLE Do you make it... 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN ...I use a Tens unit, sometimes. Sometimes, that's a distraction. 

00:17:15
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. Uh, and, uh, the chiropractic and physical therapy, uh, was this helpful for you? 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN No 

00:17:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE No, no. Okay. Um 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN We can't hear her? 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE You cannot hear her? 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Probably because I'm turning my head away from the microphone. 

00:17:40
BERNHARD TRENKLE Yeah, okay. Yeah, later, you can sit in this way. Um, some medication? You are using medication? 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Yes, I use Hydrocodone. 

00:17:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. Okay! So, I think, for the demonstration, I know enough, and we are sitting, now, you are absolutely parallel, um, and you have the hands on your leg, and I will first explain the approach to you, and then, I will demonstrate it and you will following, following me. You will use me as a role model. Um, actually, the word 'hypnosis' is the wrong word, though, so, also, 'self-hypnosis' is somehow the wrong word. The man who invented the word, around 1830, wanted to change hypnosis, what is meaning 'sleep', wanted to 'monoidism,' concentrated on one thing. Concentrated on one idea. Actually, uh, an artist and singer and violin player and sportsman is performing best when he is highly concentrated and relaxed, at the same time. So, you can say it's a technique, where you are learning to be highly concentrated and relaxed, at the same time, and this state of mind, we are also using to, uh, work on your problem, in direction of your goal. So, in movies, when you see classical hypnosis, you sometimes see a crystal ball and the hypnotist is saying, "Look at this crystal ball, and you hear only my voice and nothing else." So it's, uh, focusing the attention only one point, and your hear only the voice, and you look always at one spot, and going in this highly concentrated, relaxing state. So, the crystal ball is the expensive version. You can take any dirty spot on your carpet, that's the inexpensive version, um, you can use a ring at your finger. Uh, you, there are a lot of spots you can use, so you look at such a point, and I'm still explaining, later we will do it. So, I look at one of the spots and I think four times what I'm seeing, four times at what I am hearing, four times at what I am feeling. Then three times, three times, three times. Two times what I'm seeing, two times what I'm hearing, two times what I'm feeling. Just show it. I see the spot, I see in the peripheral, peripheral, periphery, I see some people moving. I see you, on my right side. I see that the carpet has a dark color. I hear this constant ventilation noise. This ventilation noise is getting stronger, at the moment, now, it's getting more silent again. I hear some people doing something in the room, coughing. I feel my body, I feel the temperature of my hands, I feel my feet on the floor, and so on. So, four times what you are seeing, four times hearing, four times feeling. Three times, two times, one time. Some people have told me it was to brief, but then, when they exercised at home, they have had to make five, four, three, two, one to really get through. Later, if you have a little bit more exercise, in my experience, it's almost too long. I, I'm take, in the meantime, a briefer version, and, that's the first step. Second step, you are closing the eyes and going to a nice, real memory, something you really have experienced, a nice massage, or end of a vacation at the beach. You are relaxed. You are enjoying life, and you do as if you would be at this beach and doing the same; four, three, two, one, seeing, hearing, feeling. Um, I just do it briefly. Later, we will do it in one whole. I see this beautiful island next to my island. I see blue water. I see surfing people. I see sailboats. I hear the wind blowing, it's very strong wind today. I hear some children singing. I hear music, in the background, from the restaurant. I hear some people speaking. I feel this wind, warm wind, on my skin. I feel the sand. There's also some hard part on this beach. My elbow is a little bit hurting, and so on. I do as if I would be in this vacation and I, four times, three times, two times, one time, seeing, hearing, feeling. I am, I'm reporting life from your own experience, and, new as this technique is, you are not saying to yourself, "I am completely relaxed. I feel warm." You are going to an old memory, in which you have been feeling this way, and you will have all your sensory journals, even can you smelling and tasting, if it's fitting to the whole situation. And this old memory, will leading you and your body, if you will or not, your body will react, somehow, on this old memory. Um, and later, so that first step, to the outside, second step, old memory, and in the third step, when you are doing self-hypnosis at home, you are, you can do special pain control techniques., and I will include some pain control techniques, already, now, in this first session, so you can use it at home. And at the end, I will tell you you can count from 1 to 20, and you can reorient yourself, okay? 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Okay 

00:24:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. Um, a short explanation for the audience, I always, I change between one voice, and with I was explaining things, and demonstrating things, so I was already seeding, priming to translate "I see this point, I see the color of the floor," so I, so I was one voice for explaining, and one voice for already starting with the hypnotic procedure. So, if I'm doing this really well, the client has problems to keep the eyes open until the end of my explanation. Okay. Now, um, you can find your spot; I will look at my spot. I will do it aloud. You will just take me as an example. Um, and, of course, if somebody is coughing, we both will hear it, but maybe I'm hearing differently from you, so um, to only use me as a model, and you do what you see, hear, and feel. If I have cold feet, you can have warm feet, so, you have not to follow me exactly. You only use me as, as an example. And, I will not again tell about my island experience. I did this several years, but too many clients told me that had been disturbing, "The things you have been telling about the sailing boats and children playing, this was disturbing my memory." So, at this point, I will not again, uh, when I do it alone, I will do it this way, but now, I will not do my own memory, I will say things, which is helping you to go better in your own memory. And then, I will tell you the, this lion story, a story about the lion, and include some pain control technique and make the reorientation, okay? Plus, that was also an explanation for didactic purposes. Um, okay. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:40
BERNHARD TRENKLE I am focusing on my spot, and everybody in the room, who would like, can also focus on one spot. And, one to right can try to provide as long as possible. Um, I see this spot. I see the color of this carpet. I see many little things on this carpet. I see some little movement in the audience. I hear this constant ventilation noise. You're probably hearing the whole time, but not really hearing it, consciously. Some few other sounds. Maybe somebody is writing. It sounds like somebody is writing with a pen. Somebody's coughing. I feel my body. I feel my voice is not completely okay. My breathing, a little bit of tense in the shoulders; I'll relax my shoulders. I see the spot. Everything looks a little bit different, a little bit more bright now. 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE Again, this constant ventilation monotone sound. Somebody's coughing. My breathing. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:40
BERNHARD TRENKLE More and more relaxation. One hand a little bit warmer than the other hand, just a little bit. I focusing on this one single spot. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:00
BERNHARD TRENKLE I do see things differently, now. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
BERNHARD TRENKLE Mmm, somebo-, somebody is speaking in the far away background. 

00:29:15
[sil.] 

00:29:15
BERNHARD TRENKLE This monotone ventilation sound. Different breathing. The hands are getting even warmer. Focusing on one spot. This monotone ventilation. More and more relaxation. And now, you can close your eyes, or keep your eyes closed, or you can also do the second step with open eyes, if you prefer. Most people prefer to have it as closed eyes. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:05
BERNHARD TRENKLE In trying to find a real nice memory, maybe you have to choose from different possibilities. Decide just for one possibility. And you are going to this nice memory... 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE ...going really to this nice memory, as if you would be in this situation, and doing the same; four times, three times, two times, one time. Seeing, hearing, feeling, maybe even smelling, tasting. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:30:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE And, if I say you should be hearing it, you are still seeing, or already, again, feeling, just follow your own speed. My voice can be in the background, like a car radio. We often hear a radio in the car. We're hearing music, but we do not really hear the music, consciously. If some important traffic message, if some surprise announcement, the favorite music we are hearing, and a moment later, we are driving, talking, thinking, and so, you can go in and out. You can hear my voice and not hear my voice. Your conscious mind can analyze the whole procedure from a professional point of view. The unconscious mind can focus on the therapeutic goal, the goal which have been here publicly told, but everybody in the room can choose their own goal. So, on one side, you can have professional fun, analyze it, curiosity, compare it with your own technique, and on the other side, you can just hear a nice story and can go deeper and deeper into this nice, real memory. The conscious mind cannot do many things at the same time. With the unconscious mind, you can do more things parallel. You can sit here, in the room. You can learn this new technique. You can be in this nice, real memory, you can even analyze and compare it with, with your technique. You can do many, many things at the same time, and, additionally, on level four, level five, or perhaps, even level seven, you can hear a nice story. And the conscious mind, maybe, is interested to find out what was original story, and what is the special version of the goal, pain? Pain-free, reduction of pain, being able to move in a better way, and what, is, perhaps, a version for such a workshop, life demonstration, seminar sit-, situation, congress situation? 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:00
BERNHARD TRENKLE But maybe, you just want to relax and have only a good time, and hearing this old story, from a time when they have not invented, yet, book printing, and one generation is giving all the wisdom t-, to the next generations, in making up stories. And, there's a story of a lion, and the lion is living in a forest. U-, usually lions are not living in the forest, but, it's a story. And, in this forest, he has some really nice water, a little lake, with beautiful, fresh water. This is where it's very strange; it's always windy, always windy at this place. But, the lion is hearing this wind and not hearing the wind. He's so used to hear the strong wind. Because it's windy there, the water is never flat, like a mirror, it's always waves, ripples. And, one time, the lion is deciding to go for hunting. Scientifically trained people, who are knowing about lions in the nature, knowing about the lionesses. The women lions are mostly hunting. In the original story, the male lion was hunting, but it's a nice story, but you can make, make up the lion a lioness, and everybody can use it in the way she or he wants. So the lion is going for hunting, and he's getting more and more concentrated. Absolutely focused, he has a goal. He wants to achieve a goal, a hunting goal. He was hunting for. And he was feeling the wind, and not hearing it. and He was smelling the typical smell of his forest and not smelling it. He was so absolutely focused. He was hearing the wind, and not hearing the wind. Feeling the body, not feeling the body. Somehow seeing trees, not seeing trees, he was so focused. And somehow, he was leaving his forest. The sun was shining, it was hot, but he was feeling the change of the temperature, and not feeling it. He was so focused on his goal, but, somehow, suddenly, coming back, coming back. Coming back, his needs are coming back. He is feeling he is thirsty. He needs water. Lions can find water, but, he was far away from his own water. He has enough will, he has enough control, it would be no problem to go back to his lake and his forest, but actually, he's now thirsty. He wants to have it now. So, he was trying to find water, and he was smelling water, and this, all his life experience, he was able to find directions. And, there was a little lake, fresh water, no wind. The water was flat like a mirror, deeply blue, but as soon as he had the head above the water, he was seeing this other lion, and he was frightened; he was shocked, so suddenly seeing another lion at the water. He was with exploring, thinking, "Okay, I can go back to doing like always, but, I am so close now." So he thought, "I wait a little bit. Probably the other lion will leave soon, and so I can drink. A little bit later, going there, immediately looking into the water. Again, seeing the other lion, so he was angry about him. He was angry about the other, and he was starting to fight. He was roaring a terrible roar, typical terrible lion roar, but the other lion was opening his mouth as wide, as widely, and roaring back as terribly. When he was looking a little bit later, again, he was seeing a helpless lion, exhausted lion, somehow sad lion, tired lion. Of course, he can go back to his little lake. That's always possible, but it's so close, and this water smells so good. So he is laying down in the shadow, and somehow, does not know what to do, walking back all this long way, or waiting again. And he was closing his eyes and he was wondering. From the conscious mind, he was thinking, "That's absolutely not adequate. It's not fitting to the situation," because he has wonderful pictures, wonderful imaginations. Actually, he has very nice, real sense memories from the past. He was a very, very little lion, and hunting butterflies. He was, had forgot all those memory, but suddenly, he was remembering two, three, four days, when he was a very, very little l-, lion, he was hunting butterflies. He had never been successful, but was so happy, and he was always confident, "This time, it will work." There was no doubt. It was a very interesting, playful learning. There was a time when things like falls and failures have not been existing. He was highly concentrated. He was fascinated. Looking back, he is understanding, in these days, he was learning all the hunting techniques. How to estimate distances. How to jump exactly to one point. How to attack somebody in middle of jumping. How to roll and attack again. He was learning all the hunting techniques in a playful way. And it was fascinating, how happy he was, without any success of catching one of these butterflies. It was a beautiful time, and when he was opening his eyes, he was seeing this beautiful lake, deep blue, flat like a mirror, and he was standing up. And he was amazed. His body was moving a little bit different. He had, on one side, he had all his fighting experience, all the life experience, everything he was knowing from fighting in life. From adult part, and at the same time, he had the playfulness. The playfulness of this very, very little lion hunting butterflies. The hips have been moving a little bit different. The shoulders have been moving a little bit different. It was a great feeling, having all the safe feelings, all the self-security, all the power of the adult, all the life experience of the adult lion, and at the same time, this playfulness of this little baby lion. And then, he was, he just was walking to the water, and just before he was reaching the water, he was hearing a voice. And, it was his own inner voice, but it was coming from outside, really loud. And the voi-, voice was saying, "What the hell with this lion? I am not interested in this lion." and he just was going to the water, drinking water. The water was making some waves now, no other lion anymore. And he was drinking and drinking. Sometimes, he was thinking, "I see this other lion," but, he was not interested, he just was drinking. And then he was going back the shadow place, and it was nice experience in one side he was a little bit tired from this long way. Body was hurting a little bit from walking such a l ong way, hunting such a long time, and that's a, on the other side, he was feeling the regenerating effect of this beautiful, fresh water. And on the way home, he was using this combination. He was using the combination of having all the life experience, all the possibility to defend himself, to fight, and the playfulness of this little lion, at the same time. He was seeing so many things he was seeing everyday, but, not really seeing, consciously. He was seeing that every, every piece of grass is a little bit different. That, he was seeing the last time he was a baby lion, and at the same time, he have all his life experience, and he felt safe. And so, he was coming back to his place, and at this place, he is, it's his place. So, he was going to sleep and reflecting the whole day, and he was still wondering about this beautiful memory with the butterflies. And he was thinking, "What else of such old memories I have, which I have forgotten?" Then he was remembering, when he was a young lion, that one lion, years ago, had had some body problems, some pain in walking and in the back. And, some old lioness have been trying to teach this lioness with a pain, what she can do. 

00:45:45

00:45:45
BERNHARD TRENKLE And, she should tell how it feels now. How it feels now, and she have had to describe it in detail, every little change. And the lion was thinking, "If you describe in 10-15 minutes, very, very in detail, how it feels now and how it now, it only makes sense if there are little changes." So, the old lion are asking this, "How it feels now? How it feels now?" And after some time, the lioness with the pain said, "I do not feel it at the moment." And then, something more interesting was happening. This old lion asked this lioness with the pain, "Can you, five minutes, say 'thank you' to this part of the body for working over decades without any problems?" And he had to say, many times, "Thank you for working without any problems. Thank you for working without any problems." 

00:47:25
[sil.] 

00:47:25
BERNHARD TRENKLE And there was even a third step he was memorizing. Later... 

00:47:35
[sil.] 

00:47:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE ...there was enough of things to say, "This is hurting all parts of the body. " Whenever you want to say something, I will hear it. Whenever, in the future, you will talk to me, I will hear it. Whenever, in the future, you want to talk to me, I will hear it. And though the recommendation was to make, to go to a relaxed state, to lay down, to sit down. Perhaps, it's better to lay down, and really describing, 15-20 minutes, "How do I feel now? How do I feel now?" And in the next step, saying, "Thank you," to this part of the body for working, without any problems, over decades. And maybe, saying "Thank you for working without problems over decades," we unconsciously can reorient, er, can reorient ourselves to the time, when it really was working without any problems. And the body can fight back, in this old movement, motions. 

00:49:15
[sil.] 

00:49:15
BERNHARD TRENKLE And whenever you want to teach me something, whenever you have to tell something to me, I will hear it. I will hear it. 

00:49:30
[sil.] 

00:49:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE And somehow, next morning, ahem, the lion was not knowing anymore, how long he was at this place until he was going to sleep. Was it a long time, and it was experienced as a short time? Or, was it rather, a short time experienced as a long time? It was, like, time was not important anymore. Somehow, he was going to sleep, and later, just before waking up, he was, again, hearing his inner voice. And the voice was saying, "Go to the future. Go to the future, to this point, to one important point where you look back." It was a strange sentence, somehow: Go to your future to the point where you look back. And suddenly, he was in the future. Many, many years in the future, and he reached an important goal and he was happy with the situation. Absolutely happy. And he was seeing all the way, which was going to this goal. With all the hindrances, with the lucky moments, with the not so lucky moments, and he really was pleased with the situation. He was in the future and could see how he made it to arrive in this happy future. And all what we started today you can do at home, in self-hypnosis. You can do it in the night dreams. You can combine it with all medical procedures, which have been successful. You can look in this huge database you have of life experience. "What little things have my symptoms made better, and what little things have made it worse?" Perhaps, things you are knowing unconsciously, but have not used it, but temporarily have been working. What is different in vacation time? What is different with temperter-, temperature changes? What kind of clothing is helpful? What kind of shoes are helpful? You can analyze, in night dreams, all this huge database of life experience, and make, consciously and unconsciously, adaptations, conclusions. 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE Combining it with modern medicine. Self-healing with all the modern technology. 

00:52:55
[sil.] 

00:52:55
BERNHARD TRENKLE Hearing different opinions. And though you temporarily close the thing for today and come back at home, and you can start to count from one to twenty, or use every technique you would like to reorient yourself. And everybody in the audience can reorient. When I look in the audience, I see some of moving and have the eyes closed. Some have the eyes open, and the body is not moving, and some are stretching. Some are taking one, or two, or three deep breaths. And the people who have the eyes open can look around that everybody has their own way in coming back. Fresh, and fully alert, and finishing what has to be finished. And in exercising this, it's good to take a time when, when you have a good time of day. When you are still fresh. Not make it in the beginning, when you are too tired. It's better to take it at a time of the day when you are really in good shape, because it's going right at the concentration, and the more concentration you have, the better it is. And, the technique I used with this, um, uh, saying 'thank you' to this, the body, uh, with the three steps I have from Bryan Almond, who has written the book 'Self-Hypnosis.' He was demonstrating it in the workshop at my, at my Institute. That's not my idea. That's the idea of Bryan Almond. I use the idea only with back pain. I use it with many psychosomatic problems, but, in many cases, I have seen tears coming out of the eyes of the patient, when they're remembering the good times, when the body was working, and they have not appreciated that the body was in good shape. And so, it's a very interesting technique you can use for different purposes, not only for back pain. Anything you would like to share with us? Not necessary. We can share... 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Um, no, I don't think so. I loved the story, and felt more relaxed. It was very good, thank you. 

00:55:40
BERNHARD TRENKLE You can write me email, would like to hear what is happening, and if you have questions, here, also, you can ask me questions. I will answer you. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:55:50
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. So, thank you. 

00:56:00
[sil.] 

00:56:00
BERNHARD TRENKLE We are very close to the end, and, has somebody a ques-, question? An answer? Um. You're sitting at the microphone? 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN My question is that, I can see how this could help with relaxation and reduce anxiety. I'm having difficulty making the connection between that and helping the pain, and having it, uh, continue past the actual self-hypnosis experience. 

00:56:35
BERNHARD TRENKLE Okay. Yeah. So, usually I teach the patient in this way, um, self-hypnosis. So, he has to break this at home self-hypnosis. So, until he is able to go really, in a, relaxed, concentrated state. And later, I usually teach him pain control techniques. There are a lot of more pain control techniques. You will find, in the literature, a lot of pain control techniques. If somebody, I have, here, fliers from the International Hypnosis Congress, I'm organizing, in Bremen, and there's also, um, um, uh, email address on it. I have around 19 or 20, uh, pain control techniques. I think I also have it in, on the English handout. If somebody wants to have it, I can mail it. There are different pain control techniques I can use. Also, Erickson has written interesting things about pain control. He have had himself pain con-, uh, pain, so you will find a lot about pain. Mark Jensen and Patterson in Seattle, uh, are probably, at the moment, the leading people in the world about hypnosis and pain and doing research. And, it's amazing what they are knowing which technique you can use with different pain. And, as well, Mark Jensen and Patterson have brand new books on the market. There, you will find everything about hypnosis and pain. 

00:58:10
Gunther Schmidt, M.D., MA 

00:58:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Good morning. My name is Gunther Schmidt, I come from Heidelberg. I'm the Director of the Milton Erickson Institute in Heidelberg, and of a psychosomatic clinic, close to Heidelberg. And today, I just want to demonstrate one of several, or many approaches, uh, how you can utilize processes, processes, uh, within a person, and also, inter-actionally, uh, which come up involuntarily, and could make either problems or be an important part of healthy solutions, as well. So, and, uh, therefore, I would like, at first, maybe to, just a few minutes, to talk about it theoretically, theoretically, but then I would like to make, to offer a demonstration with somebody who, uh, wants to clarify things in his life, or certain questions, or certain issues. Uh, very open what kind of topics are, so, we will deal with them, uh, and we can look, uh, and we'll work out something that way. Okay. So. When I talk about utilization of inner family systems, this is, of course, a metaphor. In the sense that, there is no such thing like, uh, inner family system, in an objective way, but a kind of a possibility to describe involuntary processes, in a way, uh, well, we have a little bit, very vivid, uh, interaction here, round, so, maybe we just close the door, please. That's great. Thank you. 

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, for example, when somebody develops kind of a problem, uh, whatever kind of problem that is, uh, and somebody in, in his individual way, in his unique way, experiences something as a problem. Uh, when you look from, uh, uh, uh, uh, point of view to that different perspective, how is that this kind of problem, in his experience, organized, in a sense. You will always find out when you describe it in a more detailed way, in a more slowed-down way, like, if you would reconstruct the 'script' of the process, which is, uh, contributing very much to this kind of development of a problem. You can always see the problem. It's a kind of creation of reality. Somebody creates the problem himself or herself, but on an unconscious level, on an involuntary level. Nobody does, nobody wants that, but it happens, so to speak. That, what we call 'it happens,' what usually is called an involuntary process. An involuntary process is not the same as unconsciously. All unconscious processes are involuntary, but not all involuntary processes are unconscious. Because, for example, if somebody begins to tremble or gets, uh, a sweat and is, uh, uh, a little bit nervous, and, and, things like that, uh, if it would be just unconsciously, and it, and he wouldn't even realize, that would never become a problem for him. Uh, it only becomes a problem, for example, when he realizes some kind of involuntary processes, for example, he flushes, he gets red, he, he, uh, he gets anxiety episode, and there is a conscious level in his experience, which does not want that. And so, it's always, if somebody experiences a problem, uh, you can describe it as kind of an encounter between two different fractions, or, yeah, uh, in a parliament, for example. Two groups, who, uh, have different perspectives and different, uh, opinions about it. The conscious mind level, which is usually that level, but people identify most on a conscious level with it, uh, then maybe would say, uh, "I don't wanna have that. I want to get rid of that," or so. But, uh, it's then going into a relationship, to the involuntary processes inside of the person. And, involuntary processes, as we know from brain research, are always quicker and stronger than every conscious and voluntary process. So, when somebody, uh, realizes some kind of phenomena, processes, experiences, inside of himself, which he or she doesn't want, and he begins to fight against it, for example. He begins to develop an antagonistic relationship to these involuntary parts. He usually will lose, because, it's like, if you would fight somebody who's always quicker and stronger than you are. That's not a very reasonable kind of interacting with this kind of forces, so, what does, then, when you compare a problem to what is called a solution. A solution is usually called when somebody has, even still, after that, maybe the same multiplicity inside of him. The same kind of different values, attitudes, and so on, but, they are corporating more. Corporating in a more synergetic way. In a way that likened it in a team, on a corporative organization, the different forces with different skills, different perspectives, different attitudes and values are working together. So, it's not ever possible that you get rid of any kind of parts of you, although a lot of people try very hard for years and years to get rid of those things, but you cannot extinguish anything, eh, within the brain but you can cooperate and relate helpful relationships to the same kind of phenomenon. So, in a sense, it's like, if you would do an organizational development, uh, as a counselor, when you work with, uh, things, which you usually would call, 'I've got a problem.' So, the so-called problem is a kind of a drama, where different parts interact in a certain way, uh, doing which, those parts then don't cooperate, but they fight each other or try to escape from each other, which is not possible, at all. So, what we could do today is to try out a different possibility. To integrate and corporate with those different parts, in a way that, although you may have, uh, seen it before as a problem, now "God, it's coming up again." You, maybe, you will find out that it's a big chance to have those different, and still remaining different, parts, uh, to be more flexible in different context. To be more, uh, uh, uh, able to solve problems in different contexts and different tasks, because, it's like, you have specialized members of a team. Specialized for different contexts. Learned and developed in different contexts, and you can utilize it, then, in a context-flexible way, again. And then, even you get proud of yourself and your inner team. So, like that. That would be that idea, in a sense. So, this is just a, a small introduction, of course, there's just one hour, so, uh, uh, I think I should go on and invite somebody, uh, to work with me, in a way that we can find out whether it's helpful for him or her, or, and how it could be helpful. I didn't prefer that somebody, so, I just ask somebody. Maybe we have different people, so, we could look which would be, for an hour, most appropriate. You, could you just tell me what w-, w-, w-, would be the issue? 

01:06:35
UNKNOWN Well, I'm at, uh, it seems like a mid-life crisis type of thing, where, I'm kind of semi-retired, but still doing a little clinical work, and, it's like, my, I feel like I've got a good, you know, a good number of decades ahead of me that I could do something, but it's like, "What? What should I do? Where..." 

01:06:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. I see. It's like, yeah, okay. We just go to somebody else, otherwise, then you take it. Yeah? 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN Just using hypnosis and being more comfortable with it, and not, um, having anxiety about it ( inaudible) 

01:07:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Using hypnosis. Well, I, I, what I would offer now, in this more, in this part of demonstration, is, uh, not to start with the usual way of hypnosis, but, uh, to, to discover those different parts, in a conversational way, and, from then on, go into a, kind of a, conversational kind of hypno-theraputic way, uh, which you can use everywhere. Even in a train station or whatever. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN So, I have two different parts. One part is traditional, I'm a doctor, and the other part wants to be this creative person, and, this person fi-, they're both fighting each other. 

01:07:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT They fight each other. So, okay. So, well, I've now, also, a double or triple bind, as well, already, because, every, of, of this issue is, uh, it sounds very interesting, uh, but, uh, well, I don't know how to choose myself, now, because everything would be worthwhile. So, we have a decision problem already, here, you see? That's the same thing like you would have, or maybe you would have, as well. So, uh, uh, you can write, write, start from the begin-, in a moment, in my own process, now, whatever I will now do, uh, I'm not sure whether it's really right. Because, whatever you can do, uh, I have to make, now, priority, of course, huh? In the same moment when I do a priority, some other issues, which would always be worthwhile enough, to be, uh, taken in to account, and so, have to step back. So, it's always only possible, usually with a price, not without a price, and that's not really funny. But, nevertheless, maybe that's just a so-called reality, here, around. Uh, so what would we do? Mmm-hmm? 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN You do both. 

01:09:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Hmm? Yeah, well, maybe. We both. Eh, from, from my own, I, I tell you how I now, I now decide, in the moment, and, of course, I really, this is, uh, what I do, by the way, in the moment, is, I try to do, kind of, a meta communication. Uh, because whenever you have a double bind, or triple, or multi-bind, uh, the best way to go to a solution is to start with meta communication about that you have a bind. Because, then, at least a little bit, you are more disassociated. You are not in the whirlpool of the double bind, but you are observing the guy who's in the whirlpool, which are yourself. So, you understand what I mean? So, and, my decision helper, in this moment, is, kind, what Damasio, for example, in, uh, brain research, tells, what, uh, defines, as a so-called somatic marker. The somatic marker, in the moment, for me, is really in-, intuitive measurement. criteria says to me I should start with this, uh, uh, issue; what you talked about? And then, we look at how much time we'll have, and then we go on, but, by - yeah, come on, please - by the way, because I usually try to do it, not only in a content-oriented level, but in a process-oriented level. Eh, whoever wants to join us, in a sense, uh, uh, on its own, can just go with the same issues, uh, and just transfer to your own questions. Maybe you, also, have a chance for that, and if we would have time enough, it would be great that we got that, also. I think that would fit in more for this kind of demonstration than what you talked about, but, uh, we'll try. So, is it okay with you? I'm sorry that I, well, you see you have to step, and, by the way, in the moment, when you make priority, also, inside of you, uh, and something has to step back. A very, very important part of the next set would be that you, in a sense, dignify, the parts who have to step back and wait. Because, it's not at all, uh, natural for those parts, then, to cooperate later on again, although they have to st-, step back. This is already a big, kind of, service from them, of those parts, and that's why I want to thank you very much that you, in a sense, offered your ideas, and, uh, you have, in a sense, to suffer, to step back, now. I'm sorry about that. Okay. I tried, already, a little bit of what I wanted to demonstrate now, to, to utilize in this way, here, too. So, we have this kind of, hello, my name is Gunther. 

01:12:05
MARK Mark 

01:12:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mark, Mark. You have the choice about chairs. I took this one, because the other one always takes me down, or takes me back. Maybe, that's may be better in your case. 

01:12:15
MARK This is good 

01:12:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Okay. So. Okay, Mark, so, uh, when you are here, that's for a certain purpose. You wanna have a certain outcome, maybe. What is the issue, and what do we want to have as an outcome? 

01:12:30
MARK I'd like to have, uh, kind of a sense of more of a direction, more of a, uh, clear purpose. More of, um, um, focus on what I, uh, might do next, and... 

01:12:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT What you might do next 

01:12:45
MARK ...um, to, kind of, invest, be able to invest myself more, and to developing, um, programs, and a practice. 

01:13:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm mmm-hmm. So, uh, do I understand you right, that you have already, uh, a long time of very important and helpful, uh, experiences, but now you're, like, in kind of a turning point? Or, and a new phase of your life where, uh, things which have worked out very well for some time, are not reasonable anymore in the same way, or, or meaning, that they have been before? 

01:13:25
MARK Uh, yes, in that, uh, worked for, uh, for thirty-something years as a, for a non-profit agencies and public agencies, and, I think of, um, you know, more of, um, a, not necessarily private practice, but a, um, uh, less organizational practice. 

01:13:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

01:13:55
MARK If that makes sense 

01:13:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. And, uh, now, do I understand you right, now, you came to a point where you wanna have, you, you look to the horizon, again, in a different way, like you did before, and you're looking for the next steps in the right direction for you? 

01:14:10
MARK Correct 

01:14:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. And it obviously would not be the same direction that it was before, in total, or? 

01:14:20
MARK Not necessarily. 

01:14:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. And you're just on this point, as if you would be on a, on a crossroad of a lot of different streets are going, and every street may be invite you to something, but they shout in the same, uh, uh... 

01:14:35
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:14:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT ...uh, simultaneously, "Come on to my direction," or something like that, or? 

01:14:40
MARK Well, uh, you know, I'm kind of, in a lot of ways, my behavior is moving towards, kind of, retirement and travel, and, you know, just, kind of coasting along, but then, there's this other part that's like, well, you know I have the skills, uh, a nice library of resources, and I'd like to, still, uh, contribute. 

01:15:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

01:15:05
MARK Ah, so it's, you know, like, okay, in what manner? I don't necessarily want to contribute how I've been in the past, but more of a leadership role. More of um, ah, more of, instead of, kind of, the traditional practice, more innovative, being able to use, uh, hypnosis and neurolinguistic programming and other things like that to, um, be more innovative... 

01:15:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:15:40
MARK ...in a, in a, a practice. 

01:15:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And obviously, as far as I understand, you know that you're able to that, to do that, and you have also, uh, maybe exciting experiences with that. It's not so that you would say, "Oh, no. That's not possible for me." You, it is, it would be possible, but there are also some other ideas, or some other, uh, arguments inside of you, or? 

01:16:05
MARK Um, well, retirement, you know? The, my wife plans to retire next year, and, um, I've backed away, pretty much, uh, from, uh, practice, and so, uh, you know, we've talked about traveling and, you know, going around different places and stuff like that. Then, it's like, "Okay, where does, if we do this, where does, um, you know, being of service and contributing fit in?" 

01:16:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, it's also a question of balance, isn't it? 

01:16:40
MARK Correct, correct. 

01:16:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And then, you talk in this way about it, I, uh, I realize, maybe, and I think this is very appreciable in the way, how you say it. Uh, that's not only that you have your own in, uh, uh, maybe, well, do that, do that, do that. It's, although that you relate to the needs of your wife, and, uh, you don't want to do it just on your own. Even if it would fit just for your own, and it wouldn't fit in the balance with the needs of your wife, that wouldn't be appropriate enough. Is that right? 

01:17:10
MARK Probably, yeah. 

01:17:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah 

01:17:10
MARK There, there's some flexibility there, for her, too... 

01:17:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah 

01:17:15
MARK ...but, yeah. 

01:17:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, yeah, this is, uh, by the way, I like to always comment on a meta-level for you. There's an explanation, but also, for you. Usually, from a systemic understanding, which is one of the basic backgrounds of my work, uh, you could say, it's not an individual question, only. It's a question of an inter-actional situation in the context. Just as somebody, it's also, it's important for him to be loyal, to be, not only thinking about his own needs. Then, uh, this, this inner so-called conflicts are not only inner conflicts, but it's a reaction, also, uh, in relation to your loyalty issues and things like that, and I think that's very appreciable. We should, uh, mention that. It's not only, "Aha, this man has some inner conflict," uh, it's, uh, it's much more, in a sense. And, by the way, also, that way, we have to take that into account, as well, if you would come to any kind of appropriate, fitting decision for yourself, that's not only from the systemic understanding, an appropriate, fitting decision for yourself, it's also as if you would, uh, yeah, do something in relationships. 

01:18:25
MARK It's ecological for the... 

01:18:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Exactly. 

01:18:30
MARK ...larger system. 

01:18:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah, yeah. You, you are somebody else, so to speak, made to, if you made a decision, uh, compared to when you have not made the decision, and "Ah, uh" swinging back and forth, in a sense, as if you would offer some different relationships, and we have to take that into account, as well. So, okay, when you, when you have this as a starting point, what would be your wanted outcome? 

01:18:55
MARK I gue-, um, it's kind of clear, more of a, a feeling of, uh, that I'm on the cr-, a good path, not necessarily correct path, but a good path. 

01:19:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

01:19:10
MARK Um, that there's a, uh; that I, that I have a, kind of, clear goal. 

01:19:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

01:19:20
MARK Uh, direction of where I'm going, and not just, kind of, "Well, let's do this today." 

01:19:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm, mmm-hmm. So, that's not only that, "Let's do this today," but also, "I have a clear goal," which is a little bit like a, uh, a, a, a something, a, a single... 

01:19:35
MARK Direction 

01:19:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh, for the direction, uh, in a far distance, or something. Okay. I guess, in your life, you have to develop that very often times. It's not the first time you have to devol-, uh, or, would you say that would be the first time you could say, "Aha! Now, I'm on my way, and I have this kind of goal"? 

01:19:55
MARK Not really. 

01:20:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Well, why not? That's okay. 

01:20:00
MARK Um, uh, pf-, you know, I got into this field, uh, via, uh, Vietnam War was going on. I don't, I was in college, and, uh, um, graduated and that was, in '71, the draft ended, so. I had already gone through my physical for the draft, but they cut the draft off, so, um, and I, you know, was lookin' around for a job, and I still wanted to do some kind of service, so I started working at a psychiatric facility. 

01:20:35
MARK Um, but then, you know, after doing that for a few years, it, um, a friend of mine said, "Well, um, I'm moving to Lawrence, Kansas." Um, I said, "Okay, I'll move there, you know, and start working in an agency." Um, then another friend said, "Well, I'm gonna go to graduate school in Nebraska. I said, "Oh, that sounds interesting." Uh. So, I went to graduate school in Nebraska. Um, and, you know, just, "Well, work for this agency, that sounds good." Um, kinda, and that's, I guess that's part of the problem now. I feel like I'm still drifting, and I'd like to do something a little more, um, personally directed, I guess. 

01:21:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Well, on the other side. This is interesting, how do you, how you describe it, and, the way you describe it, from my understanding, is as if you would, a little bit, discount your way of doing things like that. Uh, and not appreciating them so much. As it were, "I should have done it differently." On the other side, but this is just an offer of another perspective. You don't have to buy it, so. You could also say as well, "Well, this man has a high, uh, competence in delegating, uh, things like that," and he looks, uh, for somebody who says, "I go somewhere," and you say, "Go ahead, I'll, uh, you, you look for the pathway, then I'll come," so to speak. And, in a sense, this is a real competence in several contexts, but the way you described it, I had the impression, it's just my, uh, individual impression, that you didn't really, uh, appreciate it or value it in a, in a very appreciative way. 

01:22:35
MARK Not, not particularly. Um, you know, it's, it seems like I'm, I've been more of a follower... 

01:22:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:22:45
MARK ...and not so much as valui-, valuing my own, kind of, direction of thoughts and going that way. 

01:22:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Okay. So, from my understanding, I would not say this is a problem, from my understanding. That's you, you, you always please, ah, very critical to my ideas, because you don't have to buy it. From my understanding, I would say, when I would talk with Milton Erickson, he would say, "Well, the best thing is not to change things like that, so much, when they are working so long - but to utilize them." in a sense. So, well, uh, we could, in any case, we could say, "Mark is somebody who's very competent in, uh, being a good follower, but always, maybe, I think he will make his own choice where to follow. He would not follow every path and every invitation. Uh, so, it's not that he's only a follower, he's a very critical, maybe, and a sophisticated kind of follower. Uh." Well, I don't know, uh, so, so... 

01:23:50
MARK Hopefully 

01:23:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah well, and therefore, when I would talk with Milton, he would say, "Don't try to change his very good competence to be a follower, but try to offer him a utilization of that," maybe, he would say, I don't know. We would look, so. How do you cope with yourself and you're in this situation, now? When you don't know exactly where to go and that? How do you valuate yourself? How do you talk to yourself? How do you, uh, yeah, go into relationship to yourself? Do you like that very much, uh, that side of you, or? 

01:24:30
MARK Um, yes. In that, you know, I, I, uh, do meditation, and, um, uh, yeah. I, I like, uh, a lot of times, being alone, uh, taking my dog for a walk. 

01:24:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:24:45
MARK You know, um, so, yeah. 

01:24:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So you had good times with that, too. 

01:24:50
MARK Yeah 

01:24:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT I, I ask that, therefore, when somebody is in such a transitional period, very often people become impatient with themselves, or angry that they don't have the clear idea, yet, or things like that, but that's not the case with you. 

01:25:05
MARK Uh, not really, no. 

01:25:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT That's good 

01:25:05
MARK Sometimes, like, I get too many ideas, and it's like, "Okay, let's just sit here and see what happens." 

01:25:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, yeah. Okay, you see. It's like having a hearing, and you get different offers, then you decide. Is that the case? 

01:25:20
MARK Yeah, yeah. 

01:25:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh. So, when you look for that, uh, and I'm still wondering what would be the wanted outcome? The wanted outcome would be, as far as I understand, that you would then, uh, have, uh, a situation where you could realize, "Aha! I go, I'm not only drifting anymore, I'm also drifting, maybe, but also, I have this, kind of, uh, idea I wanna follow again, this light, or something like that. Is that? 

01:25:50
MARK That could happen, yeah. 

01:25:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Would that be a good outcome for you? 

01:25:55
MARK Yeah. That would be all right. 

01:25:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Okay. So, in a sense, we would, now, in an imaginary way, think about what kind of different, uh, offers inside of you are there. Uh, and how would you, as the director of the whole hearing process, for example, then cope with those different offers? Of course, I understand it in a way that you have different 'offers.' You could just retire, for example. Maybe, there's a part who would say, "What are the," I ask you, what are the, the most typical parts, which offer you something inside of this situation at the moment? 

01:26:25
MARK Well, I, kind of, you know, fantasize about, "Okay, let's, uh, um, you know, uh, buy a house and fix it up and resell it." I can do all these, kind of, carpenter-maintenance types of things. 

01:26:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:26:40
MARK And um, you know, kind of, you know, step away from mental health, uh, practice and, you know, kind of do physical and, um, kind of activities that I also enjoy. 

01:26:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:27:00
MARK Um, another would be, um, you know, I have some psychiatrist friends and connect, uh, up with them, and be part of, you know, develop an agency with them. Um, with the understanding of, you know, you know, hypnosis and hypnotherapy and neurolinguistic programming would be, you know, part of the practice. 

01:27:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:27:25
MARK Um, so, yet, it seems like I've got, kind of, a range. I could, you know, kind of, go and do what I've been doing and work for another agency. Um... 

01:27:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And, and maybe your wife would say, "Now, we want to travel a little bit," or? 

01:27:40
MARK Yes, that's true. Um, we live in Las Vegas, and it's hot there during the summer. It'd be nice to go elsewhere. 

01:27:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. So, when you, in an imaginary way, you would be the Director of, uh, a kind of an inner-hearing process, and, you have different, uh, people or different parties who offer you some ideas. For example, "Oh, come on, go on the same way as you did," another way , "Come on, retire, buy a house," or whatever, and, if you imagine those parts like sitting at a round table, or somewhere, uh, would sit around you, or stand around you, whatever you prefer. Uh, so you can, uh, say, like in a, kind of, yeah, conversation, "Well, who wants to offer me what?" so, we have different offers, and then, you are the one, uh, to make the best kind of choice, uh, for you. Where would, for example, sit in your inner, imaginary space, the part that says, "Come on, just do, just retire. Buy a house, and resell it, and, and fix it." Things like that. Where would that part be? 

01:28:45
MARK Uh, probably here. 

01:28:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh, so? And, uh, where would the other parts be? For example, uh, "Just go to another agency," or... 

01:28:55
MARK That'd be. 

01:29:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh. Trouble with your wife, or someone? 

01:29:00
MARK That'd be here. 

01:29:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. Somebody else? Important things, or would, uh... 

01:29:10
[sil.] 

01:29:10
MARK Um, well, I mean, these things can, kind of, change. Uh, part of the main reason we're in Vegas is my wife's, uh, elderly parents, uh, and they're in their mid-80's, and, you know, they could go another 10 years, or 10 days. Uh... 

01:29:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Of course 

01:29:30
MARK ...and that would... 

01:29:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

01:29:35
MARK ...kinda change things, uh, you know, make moving elsewhere an option. 

01:29:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:29:45
MARK So, that would be, you know, that could be a factor that would, you know, kind of, stir things up. 

01:29:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And that's all simultaneously part of the situation, in which you are now. So, it's, in a sense, when you talk about this kind of multi-balances, it's not ambivalence, it's multi-balance, in a sense. 

01:30:00
MARK Right 

01:30:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT I think this is not something bad, in a sense. It's as if you would want to take into account all those different, and very important, issues, in a sense. So, and, they are offering all of those ideas at the same time, and you are the one which get those offers. 

01:30:20
MARK Yeah 

01:30:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Some of the time, some people don't want to have so many offers, but now, you got it. 

01:30:25
MARK Yeah. It's, it's like, I want a five year plan, here, to kind of, you know, get more direction. 

01:30:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Of course. And, it's not easy, because some of those issues, you cannot plan. For example, how long is it with the elderly parents of your wife, and things like that. In a sense, you are in a situation, where it is so understandable that you want to have this kind of plan, and at the same time, maybe something inside of you realizes exactly, you cannot plan about everything. It will be so beautiful, but, on the other side, maybe, it's just not possible. So, how to cope with that, in a way? Yeah, that's right. You can appreciate yourself being in a situation, and, being in a situation, not because you are superficial or whatsoever, but just because you want to take into account all those important things. It's a very loyal and responsible person, uh, and therefore, a little bit, like, a little bit confusing, sometimes, maybe. 

01:31:25
MARK True 

01:31:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, my, uh, offer to you would be now, you build up, now, kind of a conference leadership, uh, as you, that you have all those things because you don't get rid of them, but you can cope with them, in a way, which is breath-by-breath, uh, fitting for you, and you can go step-by-step with it. Listen to them, make good decisions, and so on, and make, and I don't know what would be the right solution for that, but I am sure you have an inside knowledge about that. What would be step-by-step? Like, every breath you take, the right solution, accompanied by a part who has a big longing for, "Oh God, I finally want to have this clear way." The five year plan, and things like that, because that's also a part of your conference. One of your parts says, "Oh, God, it will be so great not to drift anymore, and now, we have this five year plan," and now, you're straight ahead, and, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, and it's so clear, and finally you've stopped this drifting, and things like that. "Ah, God, that would be so good." But then, the other parts say, "Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no." No? 

01:32:45
MARK True 

01:32:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, for example, uh, that's why I would like to invite you, in a moment, to don't look to these parts. Just for a moment, but we just focus on you as the Director of the whole, uh, conversation. And, whenever you, in your life, have made decisions where you, or, or have experiences where you would say, "Yeah, right. That's fitting in the moment. That's fitting here." I think you have experiences like that. Uh, how would you realize? What is your criteria to realize the, "Aha! Now, this is the fitting, here. That's the right decision in the moment."? Is it a feeling? Is it a kind of a body reaction? Because, maybe it's more than a cognitive thing. 

01:33:40
MARK It's kind of like hindsight. 

01:33:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Hindsight? And how would you express hindsight, for example? 

01:33:45
MARK Uh, it's like, after I do something, like, to evaluate and say, "Well, that worked," or, "Not so well." 

01:33:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. So, part of a very helpful process, obviously, is also, that in a sense, you've had the courage to do something in the moment? Not knowing, yet, that it's the right thing? 

01:34:10
MARK Que sera, sera. 

01:34:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And later on, you had this hindsight. 

01:34:15
MARK Yeah 

01:34:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT When you had the hindsight, uh, how would you realize it? 

01:34:25
[sil.] 

01:34:25
MARK Um, well, the feeling is that it's, uh, satisf-, uh, peaceful, satisfying, it's like, uh, yeah. Yeah, that was good. That worked. 

01:34:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. That worked. So, and, you, even if you don't realize, uh, uh, couldn't realize it on a conscious level, something inside of you knew, that's the right thing, though. 

01:34:50
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:34:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And obviously, that has to have criteria, uh, uh, which have to be fulfilled. I don't know them. Do you know them consciously? 

01:35:05
MARK Well, it's, um, it's like feedback from, you know, uh, whatever I've done, and it's like, "Okay, that," you know, what I'm hearing or experiencing is that, uh, that worked well. 

01:35:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Feedback from other people, or... 

01:35:20
MARK Sometimes, yeah. Or, you know, a project or something, it's like, "Well, that worked. That was good." 

01:35:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

01:35:30
MARK Say I've been able to fix the toilet. 

01:35:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, in a sense, uh, the first thing I would like to imply to you, is to focus on this kind of hindsight experience, because, maybe, that could be a help for creating the, the conference in a way that you cope with different parts as, in a way, as if you had been, have reached, already, the position of the hindsight, uh, thing. But maybe, if that would not be enough, we have to look for something else, because, what I realize now, when you talk about it, is, you're in a situation, now, in the moment where, you can do whatever you want. There will remain a kind of uncertainty, whatever you want to do, and it's so understandable that you have this part who wants to have this five year plans, because when I, I'm asking myself, "What for? For what purpose does this part want the five year plan?" For me, this is a kind of a strategy to develop security, to develop a kind of a, an orientation," myself? Yes. And yes. And yes. But for that, in a sense, you would have to know about the future, a clarified picture about the future, and, as hard you will try, you will not manage that, so we have to look for a solution, as well, for a solution how to cope with remaining uncertainty. 

01:37:00
MARK Being more comfortable with that unknowing that... 

01:37:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah 

01:37:05
MARK ...uncertainty, yeah. Yeah. 

01:37:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Is that making sense to you? 

01:37:10
MARK Yes 

01:37:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And, in a sense, that's only a second best choice or solution, because, the best would be, you would know the future, and you would have this kind. So whatever we do, in a sense, it's already second best. To, related... 

01:37:25
MARK For... 

01:37:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT ...related to the part that is longing to strive for security, doing the right thing, being satisfied, content with that, and also, satisfying other people, and I think that's a very appreciable attitude inside of you, but, to really, certainly, get it, you would have to know about the future. 

01:37:45
MARK Yeah, yeah. 

01:37:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And so, this is... 

01:37:50
MARK Yeah 

01:37:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Isn't that a pity? 

01:37:55
[sil.] 

01:37:55
MARK That's tough. 

01:37:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And this is not because you did something wrong, it's just, as we say in Latin, "en concreto humana." The human condition. Whatever you do, you're a finite person, and that there's this longing part who wants to have this security. So, we have to look for the second best solution, but what means, the solution to cope with this remaining uncertainty, as well. But, maybe, you could, uh, get help from the hindsight experience inside of you. Let's, for example, just focus a little bit, it would be in this situation, just after you're done, things like that, and you had, uh, you had the experience of, "Oh, yeah." So, you focus on that, and you, and you have this feeling, here, this satisfied feeling? How would your breathing be? 

01:38:55
[sil.] 

01:38:55
MARK Deeper, and... 

01:38:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Deeper? 

01:39:05
MARK ...slower, calmer. 

01:39:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Slower? And we can develop this experience on all sensory levels. For example, you can also, uh, try to express it in movement or in body posture, body coordination, because that's a very helpful exerci-, uh, helpful with this. What would be, let's say, in a gesture or a mimic way, the expression of, "I'm just in this position. I'm just in this moment of experience of hindsight." What would you hands, for example, describe in a symbolic way? When you would say, "Ah, now, I'm there." Is it that your hands would be there, or so, ah, uh-huh, mmm-hmm. And how much space would you have around yourself and your involuntary inner-experience level? A lot of space? 

01:39:55
MARK Yes 

01:39:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. And when you wanna develop your space again, so, in a protective way, would it be more helpful to make it this way, or this way? For example, you could just try out. Your body knows, exactly, I guess. 

01:40:10
MARK For safe... 

01:40:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Fo-, that you can develop a safe place. A safe place, with a safe space, where you have overview, and you can listen to all those different voices, different parts, and nevertheless, have this contact with the hindsight experience. Would you be so? Or, would you be so, or so, or so? Or how would you say, for example? 

01:40:30
MARK Probably like this. 

01:40:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Like this, okay. And then, you would have this kind of deeper breathing? 

01:40:40
[sil.] 

01:40:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And you would also have this, maybe? Something else would be helpful, or would it be enough? 

01:40:55
[sil.] 

01:40:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. And now we could, in a sense, uh, reestablish this conference around you. When you are sitting there, and you're the President of the whole, uh, uh, club, so to speak, or the team. 

01:41:15
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:41:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Where would all, uh, related to this kind of precision, to this kind of directing, uh, attitude of position and coordination. Where would all those different parts sit around? 

01:41:30
MARK Yeah. This would be the, um, moving into my own kind of practice. Uh, this would be the, you know, retirement and the, uh, family-type of thing, and, this would be the, kind of, in between. 

01:41:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT How long, uh, how far away from you would they stand? Let's, for example, if I would be, and you direct me; I would be those parts. 

01:42:00
MARK Yeah, about right... 

01:42:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT I'm here, and I would be the, which one? 

01:42:05
MARK Uh, kind of the in between, the, um, a little bit of both. A little bit retirement... 

01:42:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. Do both, do both. 

01:42:15
MARK ...and, you know, maybe, working for somebody else. 

01:42:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:42:15
MARK Some of what I've been doing before. 

01:42:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And, uh, which part would be here? 

01:42:20
MARK Uh, that would be the part of, uh, kind of, going on my own directing, working, maybe, with psychiatrists, and... 

01:42:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:42:30
MARK ...that type of thing. 

01:42:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm, and how far away from you would it be, so that you could be in this Director position? In this position where you could say... 

01:42:35
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:42:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT ..."Well." It's interesting. You know exactly. Your inner, your inner knowledge knows exactly. 

01:42:45
MARK About right there. 

01:42:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Right there. And who is the other part, here? 

01:42:50
MARK Uh, that's like working for someone else, an agency, just kind of following along type of thing. 

01:42:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Here? Over? 

01:42:55
MARK Uh, about here. 

01:42:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh, interesting. So, any still there other parts? Maybe traveling with your wife, things like that? 

01:43:00
MARK Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

01:43:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT "Oh, come on." Travel, travel, travel, travel. 

01:43:05
MARK Eh, a little closer. There you go. 

01:43:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT He, he's a very competent Director. Yeah, Mark. You know exactly where the seating position has to be. And then, you have this other part that says, "Ah, come on. Make this five year plan, very clear. You have step-by-step, everything clear." Where would that be? 

01:43:25
MARK Hmmm. Probably right there. 

01:43:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So that you can be in a new position of feeling good, fitting, like, in this hindsight flow, so to speak, where would it be, here? 

01:43:35
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:43:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Okay. Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm? No? 

01:43:40
MARK Mmm-hmm. Kind of over my shoulder. 

01:43:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah, usually, this is the place. For example, and you, let's reconstruct a little bit when you don't feel good with it. This, this, this part, from bir-, would it, uh, approach you so that you don't feel good? Would it come from the back side? Is that? You have to make this. Come on, come on, come on, come on. You have to make this. Five year plan, five year plan. Really clear, finally. Not following anymore, now, you're the one. Is that? 

01:44:10
MARK No, not so much. It, it, it's almost like that's what, you know, I'm kind of going along. That's what you're supposed to do. You know, have a five year plan type of thing, that that's how you achieve your goals and stuff... 

01:44:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:44:30
MARK ...and so, it's like... 

01:44:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm? 

01:44:30
MARK ...um... 

01:44:35
[sil.] 

01:44:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh, but when you're... 

01:44:35
MARK ...kind of a following type of thing that I do. 

01:44:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT When you feel fine with this, where would it have to be so that you could sit here and say, "This is part of my conference, and I'm the leader of the conference."? Would it be here? Or where? 

01:44:50
MARK Probably over here. 

01:44:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Ah, interesting. Five year plan, five year plan, five year plan. 

01:44:55
MARK Yeah, yeah. That's... 

01:45:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Come on, five year plan. But you are the Director who feels good now, and you can direct those different parts. Would that be the right thing? Because, what I, uh, to mention on the meta level, it's not the contents of these parts which make, maybe, problems, or, it contributes illusions. It's always the, the precision in the whole thing, uh, from when you approach, they approach you, and from where you can react to that. 

01:45:25
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:45:25
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And then you can, now, we make a new network, which is what I offer to you. That all those parts can do something, but you are in the position of the 'Hindsight Director,' so to speak, so then, you can respond in a totally different way to them, and therefore, this is what I'm, uh, asking you, is to, to place where those parts are related to the hindsight, uh, position. Would it be here? 

01:45:50
MARK Probably off the edge. 

01:45:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Okay. I don't go now. You have an imaginary competence, you know. So, now, just let's, uh, imagine a little bit, just refocus please, refocus on your hindsight position. Maybe you even can, also, a little bit, reinforce it with your hands and your breathing, like that. So? And you look around, all those different fear things, and they offer you all this as a, "Do that, do that, do that, do that, do that, do that, do that, do that." How to respond coming from this kind of hindsight experience. "Do that, do that, do that, do that, do that." 

01:46:35
MARK Um, slow it down. Um, what, what are the kind of component, pieces of, you know, what is the benefit? What is the, you know, kind of, plus and minuses? 

01:46:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:46:55
MARK Of that, of doing that or not doing that... 

01:46:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:47:00
MARK ...and doing this and not doing this. 

01:47:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT How would you express that in, maybe, in, in, in a nonverbal way? Slow down. 

01:47:10
[sil.] 

01:47:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm. Now, just, let's imagine they all shout simultaneously "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh." And you could take a deep breath with it. "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh." What is your reaction? 

01:47:30
MARK Eh. 

01:47:35
[sil.] 

01:47:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT "You really have to, you really have to, you really have to, you really have to, you really have to." 

01:47:40
[sil.] 

01:47:40
MARK Manana 

01:47:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT How could you feel what's appropriate for you? And what would be like, a small symbol with your hands because you have your hands always with you, so, you can make it as kind, use it as a transfer, helpful intervention, just to make a small movement which brings altogether. 

01:48:00
MARK Um, come back to me tomorrow with it, uh,a lot of times, it's like, I get an idea about something, and it's like, "Okay, that kinda sounds good. Okay, that'd be interesting. Um, I think I need to let it go, and if I, if it comes back to me again, ah, then, you know, I can look at it, you know, it's like, "Oh yeah, that is a good idea." And I can, kind of, detail it a little bit more, and send it away, and it's like, okay, um, if it comes back a third time. Then it's like, "Okay, all right, well. That, that, maybe I should continue..." 

01:48:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And obviously... 

01:48:50
MARK ..."and follow that." 

01:48:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT ...as I understand you, that is a very good and helpful way to find your appropriate fitting decisions. Uh, do I understand you right? 

01:49:00
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:49:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, if you would allow yourself to just use this kind of real good way to, to make your decision. Not just, just, "Oh, do it," come back again, come back again, and so on, until it's fitting. And how would you realize, let's say, in the third time, "Okay, that's really good."? Where do you realize it? How do you realize it? Maybe, you don't realize it consciously? 

01:49:20
MARK Well, a lot of times, if it eliminates, you know, several competing voices, ah, that they don't come back for the second and third time. 

01:49:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT That sounds like a Taoistic, very wise attitude, in a sense. Not always to go within, just to develop and, and let the develop happen, and then, uh, take the choice again. So, I think you have, you should be much more appreciated for your way of making decisions, in a sense, that's my understanding. Well... 

01:50:00
MARK Thank you 

01:50:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT ...you don't have to buy it. So, okay, now, is it okay to refocus on that? You're sitting there; you're in this position? And, you have this position of, "Okay, I'm in my hindsight position." And then "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh," and you have to find "the right decision, the right decision, the right decision, the right decision," and what would your best response to that be, so that you find your own rhythm of decision, your own rhythm of taking the right next step. "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh..." 

01:50:40
MARK It's kind of like, who, kind of, steps forward and, um, to kind of, then, analyze the details, um, and, you know, depending if it's, like, first, second, third, you know. Either go back and, you know, kind of, um, let it percolate some more, and, um, if it's like the, you know, kind of, third time, it's like, "Okay, well, that seems, uh, useful." Um, then, then it's like, "What are the other, kind of, external factors? Are they, kind of, uh, fitting or falling into place?" And, so then, you know, kind of follow that direction. 

01:51:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah. And obviously, you have this kind of position, that, you have developed it already, that you ju-, you just have to use it, in a sense. Is that appropriate for you? So, let's just rehearse a little bit, again, so that you can use it. They are coming, "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh," and what would, maybe, again, be a symbolic movement, of your hands or whatever, that brings you into good contact with your ability to cope with those different forces and different things like that, "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh," that you arrive with them, that you arrive with them, accompanied by good breathing and this space around you, contact with your hindsight experience. "Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh da-duh, da-duh-, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh, da-duh. And you are, with your, and if somebody else were to have brought you too much, what could you do to redirect them to the right place? Rrrrrrrr. Would you, like, conductor, or something? 

01:52:55
MARK Going this way 

01:52:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT How do you feel with that? How do you feel with that? 

01:53:00
MARK Okay. Yeah. 

01:53:00
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Let's assume you would cope whenever those questions come up. You would cope starting from this kind of experience, eh, eh, an-, and position inside of you, responding to those different offers. Would that be helpful for you? 

01:53:20
MARK Mmm-hmm, yes. 

01:53:20
GUNTHER SCHMIDT On a scale of 0 to 10, for example, 10 would be the best you can imagine, where would you be with that? 

01:53:30
MARK Seven 

01:53:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Oh? 

01:53:30
MARK Mmm-hmm 

01:53:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT That's almost the optimum, that would be with eight, something like that. What could, uh, be added, to come to aid, maybe, but it's not necessary for it to come to aid, it's just a question. 

01:53:45
[sil.] 

01:53:45
MARK Uh, I think the, the feedback from, uh, colleagues, friends... 

01:53:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:53:50
MARK ...family... 

01:53:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Mmm-hmm 

01:53:55
MARK ...that, that would be yeah, you know, kind of, suppor-, supportive... 

01:53:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah? 

01:54:00
MARK ...um, that, "Yes, Mark, that would be an interesting thing for you to do." 

01:54:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And if you would, uh, uh, ask for feedback, or invite people to go, uh, feedback, would it be helpful, to respond from the same position, to this feedback? Because the feedback, again, could, in a sense, make confusion, sometimes, so, but, then you have the feedback from, because the feedback could also be different points of views and things like that. Contradictory, uh, things, again, but, would it be helpful, then, to respond from that kind of position, uh, also, to the feedback? 

01:54:35
MARK Yes, yes. 

01:54:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh. 

01:54:35
MARK Kind of, sort through it... 

01:54:35
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah? 

01:54:40
MARK ...you know, uh, um, you know, what is their agenda? You know? 

01:54:45
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Yeah 

01:54:45
MARK And, uh, go from there. 

01:54:50
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Now, I would, because I have to look for the time, and we have, uh, uh, to close, sorry, uh, uh, in some minutes. But I would like to add something, one idea to the whole thing, until now, because this is, uh, from experience, because, a lot of people with, uh, uh, similar decision problems or decision questions. Uh, it's very natural that one wants to have the 'right' decision, in a sense. And then, I ask people, "What would be the right decision?" Many people say, "Well, the right decision would be, if I know that the outcome would be like I want it, li-, like I want it, but that means to know the future, and also, that, after I made the decision, it's really, then, everything calmed down, and it's, like, peace inside of me. There's no, 'Yes, but,' but when I look, it's like in a, in a democracy parliament, in a sense, like that." So, I ask for examples. Some people, then, "Well, how many in your inner parliament, your inner person-, eh, uh, what would be the percentage of the parliament? Who, who would say yes, that it's a good decision. Some people say 90 percent, or something like that, then, I ask them, "Do you prefer a parliamentary democracy, or do you prefer something like we had in the DDR, in the German, in the, uh, uh, or, in the, uh, Russia or somewhere?" Well, of course, "Parliamentary democracy, democracy," but, the inner word, they prefer a, a state terrorism, so to speak. So, uh, so, but it would be enough to have 50.1 percent, for example, and the democracy is functioning very well, when you have, also, a big strong opposition, everything, which has to step back, is let's, say, the opposition, who is shouting, even more loudly that it has to stay back. That would not mean that the decision was bad, it just means that your, uh, your parliamentary democracy is functioning very well, in a sense. And, it's the, the very important other step, that when I ask, "What is so important that you know about the outcome?" the people usually say, "Well, if I would not have the right outcome, I would criticize myself." Therefore, I would like you, because you, uh, I think you, if you think it's interesting, could add that to that. If you would make a kind of a meeting with the future Mark, the Mark you would be in five years, for example, uh, looking back to the situation today, tomorrow, whatsoever, what would the Mark of the present time need from the future Mark, as a support that he can make decisions in remaining uncertainty, because, whatever you do, the re-, the uncertainty remains, and I just want to show you, if this future Mark, it looks different from me, of course, if that would be here, in that time, in the future, and then, we'll find out the outcome was not like you wanted it to have it, in the present, usually, the people are afraid that this future Mark, for example, or Gunther, or whoever, turns around and says, "Oh, you silly guy, what did you do?" But this is unfair, because he knows much more than the present Mark can ever know. So, so usually would be now that the future Mark, for example, is very reliable, that whatever the outcome would be, even if it would not be the wanted outcome, he would turn to the present Mark and say, "Listen, you had such a good courage to do it anyway, and I'm the one to support and just console you, that there's a, and I wanna support you that you made a courageous decision, and stay with you, as your loyal friend. Could you imagine the future Mark as such a, kind of, accompanying guy? 

01:58:55
MARK Yes 

01:58:55
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So that in the present, the present Mark, knows exactly whatever the outcome is. "The future Mark will support me, will strengthen my back, will be my loyal friend, acknowledging me for the courageous step - that I did a step anyway - and, he also consoles me that the present Mark cannot know what the future will bring, and nevertheless, is so courageous to do this issues. What would be this kind of encounter? When you imagined an encounter between future Mark and the present Mark, would the future Mark like this, like this kind of a,uh, tower, which is kind of firing, "Mark, I am waiting on you, and you can rely on me. You can rely me, I'll support you and console you." Where will it be in your inner world? Will it be right in front of you, or? 

02:00:00
[sil.] 

02:00:05
MARK Probably over here, or... 

02:00:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Uh-huh? 

02:00:10
[sil.] 

02:00:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And then, where you would be, in such a situation, with "Do that, do that, do that, do that, do that," and you have this, and you can take, also, a look to, "Hi, over there." Would that be helpful, also? 

02:00:30
MARK Yes 

02:00:30
GUNTHER SCHMIDT So, we try, just for the last time, then we close it, okay? I do it again, "Do that, do that, do that, do that,duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh. Woooo woooo woooooo. You have your, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh. Come on! Woooo woooo, woooo woooo, woooo woooo woooooo." Oh, God! It's not the same it was. "Woooo woooo, woooo woooo, woooo woooo." Then, you have this, uh, view of the future Mark. "Woooo, woooo, woooo." Oh, God. So, I think it's better we cooperate. 

02:01:05
MARK Sounds good. 

02:01:05
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Is that okay with you? 

02:01:05
MARK Yes, very good, thank you. 

02:01:10
GUNTHER SCHMIDT Thank you, very much, Mark. 

02:01:15
[sil.] 

02:01:15
GUNTHER SCHMIDT And, have a good time in the future. Maybe, you wanna, s-, s-, we have to close, anyway, but, maybe one or two minutes to somebody has a question to Mark? Well, you're already ruined. 

02:01:30
UNKNOWN How do you feel now? 

02:01:30
UNKNOWN Here. Here's the mic. 

02:01:35
MARK Is it on? That the, uh, that the, um, kind of, discomfort, or the, uh, um, scatteredness is, is, kind of, gone, and I'm, um, sort of, more comfortable, centered, and that, "Okay, whichever way I go, uh, it will be okay." Whatever I choose, you know, I have a good way, uh, to sort through it, and, to deal with it, and, um, support. I guess, I could say myself, to that, this is a good, uh, path, or, or direction I'm headed. 

02:02:40
[sil.] 

02:02:40
GUNTHER SCHMIDT I just want Mark, uh, to close. Uh, in situations like Mark reported about, uh, then you look to the literature about decision making processes and things like that, you always find this wonderful descriptions of, 'to develop smart goals.' Uh, 'smart goals,' that means for them to be specific, motivating, realistic, terminated, activating, and so on. This is a very nice idea, but, many, many contexts they are just not appropriate, because you cannot do things like that, uh, with, uh, what you would say, uh, in the sense, as clear goals, because you have so much uncertainty in the future, that you just can, in a sense, focus on how to cope with an uncertainty situation. And for that, it's much better to go on, in this way, like, we did it. I developed concepts for that. Uh, it's published in German. It's called, uh 'The Strategy of the Polynesian Sailing,' because, when you ques-, uh, when you ask the question, "How did the Polynesian people come to these different islands, without any GPS, with very small boats, and so? Uh, the idea is, the hypothesis, they say, they came from the Philippines, and they said, "Well, we have to go this way; there would be an island." And they knew very well that there's no chance to know whether there's an island or not, but nevertheless, they sailed this direction. But the, the, the purpose of the goal was never to reach it. The purpose was to go in the movement, and then, to look into every direction, where to find something, as a new feedback process, and then to go there, or go, maybe, the goal they had planned was totally different, in a different way, but the purpose of the goal is not to reach it. Eh, there's an interesting concept by a Harvard professor, Sarasvathy, called 'Effectuation,' which is very much used in organizational development, where I work, a lot, and this is a very good thing when you have no clear possibility to develop a clear goal in the future, to, uh, then, it's the question how can you come into e-, e-, experience of competence, of strength, and an ability to cope with all those questions, and this is to focus on your competence you have already, and to focus, in a way, that you say, uh, "In connection to my competence in which I had patterns of success in my past, for example, I can do, reach different goals. I don't define any goal, I reach, I, I define different goals, or I don't even say any goal. And I look, focusing on my strength, what kind of different steps can I do?" And then, you come to a very competent and reliable development, and you're not so dependant from the goal, because, when you develop a dependency from the goal, you go into a stress context, and you develop fear, because you cannot have this certainty. And then, your amticular, in the middle brain, would fire with anxiety. So, when you have a different way of criteria, like we developed it this way, then you have a feeling of certainty in a remaining situation of uncertainty, and that's the best thing you can do. That's what's said, so, thank you very much.

Dan Short, Ph.D. 

02:06:40
DAN SHORT Welcome to this demonstration. It's 'The, uh, Recognition of Previously,' uh, 'The Discovery of Previously Unrecognized Potentials.' Something along that line, right? Uh, that's one way I like, there's many ways to define hypnosis, but that's a, that's a nice little definition of the, the discovery of previously unrecognized potential. I had a, a gentleman just come up and ask me about, uh, wart removal. I was going to help his daughter, and that reminded me of a, of an interesting story. When I was still, uh, young - I was 26 - I will still brand new to this whole thing, and I was doing work at a, at an agency, and I'd, uh, studied hypnosis, uh, by then. Uh, and a social worker, clinical social worker, who worked with clients, came up to me and was saying, "You know, hypnosis Dan?" and I said, "Yes, I do." And she said, "I almost got to see hypnosis being done with my son, but something strange happened," and I was like, "Well, tell me, what happened?" And she said that he had this wart, a big wart on his hand, and they were trying to treat it, burn it off, the doctor, and they, they couldn't get rid of it. They would burn it off, it would come back later, and it would come back even bigger. They would burn it off again, and it would come back bigger, and finally, the, uh, pediatrician was, uh, in such a state of desperation, he said, "Well, you can try hypnosis. When all else fails, and there's nothing scientific to do, go to a quack," and so, he told her to call, uh, herself a hypnotist and see if he could help. Well, the mother, her boy was, uh, young, uh, and, uh, she was concerned that he would be frightened by this man, and she, I think she, herself, was a little nervous, and so, she didn't want, she wanted to try and prepare him for it. So, she made the appointment and, uh, a week before the appointment, each night before bed, she would tell him, "On such and such morning, you're going to, uh, talk to a very nice man, and he's gonna use words, and he's gonna make your wart go away." She said, "Oh, it was the most embarrassing, awful thing." She said, "On the day of the appointment, I had to call and cancel, because when he got out of bed that morning, the wart was gone. So we never got to use the hypnosis." And I said, "Yes, your boy's wart was removed by hypnosis, but it wasn't the hypnotist that did it. It was you." And she said, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Well, you were giving him those suggestions about words making a wart go away, you forgot to tell him to wait until after he talked to the man, for the wart to go away." All right. Uh, we have a demonstration we're gonna do, and, uh, we don't know what's gonna happen, yet. It's yet to be discovered, but we have a volunteer, uh, that's gonna come up on stage with us. 

02:09:40
[sil.] 

02:09:40
ALANNAH I turned it on. 

02:09:45
DAN SHORT Okay. If you wanna make your chair, I made mine a little lower, there's a little lever. Yeah, there we go. 

02:09:50
ALANNAH There we go. 

02:09:50
DAN SHORT Okay? 

02:09:50
ALANNAH Okay. 

02:09:55
DAN SHORT Hello? 

02:09:55
ALANNAH Hi. 

02:09:55
DAN SHORT Alannah? 

02:09:55
ALANNAH Yes 

02:09:55
DAN SHORT How 'bout you tell the audience, uh, a, li-, actually, better yet, let's forget about the audience. 

02:10:00
ALANNAH Okay 

02:10:05
DAN SHORT Um, they don't need to exist in our world. 

02:10:05
ALANNAH No 

02:10:05
DAN SHORT So, between you and I, uh, knowing there's an audience out there, but, between you and I, what would you like from this conversation? 

02:10:15
ALANNAH So, yesterday, in the Hypnosis Language Session 4, I took that one. 

02:10:20
UNKNOWN We can't hear her. 

02:10:20
ALANNAH Okay, all right. Um, you talked about handedness a lot, and, I am left handed, and I have been severely left handed for a really long time. When I was little, I would, like, fall out of my chair, writing. I've hurt myself, a lot, with my left handedness, and, I've always known that there's the cross-hemispheres. So, right brain, left hand. 

02:10:40
DAN SHORT Uh-huh. 

02:10:45
ALANNAH Left brain, right hand. But the way you talked about it yesterday, you, kind of, put it in a different perspective that I never really thought about, and when you were discussing talking to the 'right brain', I thought that was really, kind of, meaningful and interesting. So, I just, I don't know. I thought it was something that would be really interesting to explore... 

02:11:05
DAN SHORT Yeah 

02:11:05
ALANNAH ...because I, you know, being an academic and being a student, I know that I am very left brained, in a lot of ways. That handedness contrast made me wondered, like, "What's going on with my hemispheres?" So, that was, kind of, what compelled me to come up here and talk. 

02:11:25
DAN SHORT How comfortable do you feel with hypnosis and going into a trance? 

02:11:30
ALANNAH With the idea of it, pretty comfortable, um, I don't, I don't know how, how easily I'll go into hypnosis. 

02:11:35
DAN SHORT How's your technique? 

02:11:35
ALANNAH My technique? 

02:11:35
DAN SHORT For doing hypnosis with others. 

02:11:40
ALANNAH I've never done hypnosis with others. 

02:11:40
DAN SHORT How about with yourself? 

02:11:45
ALANNAH Unsuccessful 

02:11:45
DAN SHORT Unsuccessful? 

02:11:45
ALANNAH Unsuccessful. 

02:11:50
DAN SHORT So, one thing about, any time a person comes to do therapy, and, you do ther-, you're a therapist? 

02:11:55
ALANNAH Yes, I work with, uh, young adult substance abusers. 

02:12:00
DAN SHORT Any time at, oh, at especially young adolescent... 

02:12:00
ALANNAH Oh, I love them! 

02:12:05
DAN SHORT ...coming - wonderful. Uh, they need people to love them. 

02:12:10
ALANNAH I know, I love them. 

02:12:10
DAN SHORT There's so many therapists that refuse to work with, uh, adolescents. They need people like you. So, uh, any time you ask them to come in and do therapy, you're taking them to the edge of the unknown. 

02:12:20
ALANNAH Yes 

02:12:25
DAN SHORT You're asking them to do something they don't know how to do, and they don't know how the outcome will be, and they're very uncertain of themselves. And, my, they're not doing something that they've done time and time again. It's all brand new. My personal ethic is that it's unfair to ask people to do things that we, ourselves, are not willing to do, and if a patient's gonna have to do something they've never done before, and they don't know how it's gonna turn out while they're working with you. I like, as a therapist, to be able to be willing to do the same. And so, when I work with people, I try to work a way I've never worked before, and whether I don't know what the outcome is gonna be, other than, I'm going to do my very best, at my end, to provide therapy. So, I would like to do a demonstration with you, using a technique I've never tried before. I have no idea how it will turn out. 

02:13:20
ALANNAH Okay 

02:13:25
DAN SHORT All right? 

02:13:25
ALANNAH Okay 

02:13:25
DAN SHORT But it's aimed at, uh, tapping into unrecognized potentials, uh, that exist within you. That exist within your hands. All right? So, what I would like you to do is, take just a few moments to, uh, get comfortable, and to prepare yourself to learn how to put yourself into a trance. 

02:13:50
ALANNAH Okay 

02:13:50
DAN SHORT And while you're doing that, I'm gonna talk to the audience for just a second. 

02:13:55
ALANNAH Okay 

02:14:00
[sil.] 

02:14:00
DAN SHORT One of the things that I believe, uh, is, is, is, is very effective, and a nice way for helping an individual go into trance, is to go into trance, myself. When I'm wanting to hypnotize someone, the first person I seek to hypnotize is myself, because, if it's not a bad thing... 

02:14:35
[sil.] 

02:14:35
DAN SHORT ...if it's an okay place to be, why wouldn't I want to go there, myself? 

02:14:45
[sil.] 

02:14:45
DAN SHORT I like hypnosis. I like going into trance. 

02:14:55
[sil.] 

02:14:55
DAN SHORT It allows me the opportunity to discover, within myself, some abilities I didn't previously know where there. And I find, often, when I try to force myself to do it the right way, as I've conceived it, rather than allowing myself to respond to things I can't entirely explain? Then it's the wrong way. That it's in sometimes doing things the wrong way, you end up with the right outcome. It's rather amazing. Like the time I was doing a clinical demonstration with a man from the audience, who was gonna demonstrate how to resist hypnosis. He didn't believe in this hypnosis stuff. No one had been able to hypnotize him yet in this training, five day training. I had him come up and I said I was gonna do arm levitation. Arm levitation is one of the more difficult things to achieve, and that's what I was gonna do with him. I was gonna have his arm, on it's own accord, float up into the air. And I told him to go ahead and resist that, and do his very best to make sure that it didn't happen. "And now, I'm gonna reach for your right hand," and, I got mixed up and I reached for his left hand. So, to correct me, his right hand went up in the air, and I just stared at it, and his eyes closed and he went into a deep trance, and a few minutes later, was numb from the waist down. Since he was an ER doctor, this was a nice thing to learn how to do, how to make a person numb from the waist down. He had that ability in him, he didn't know so. 

02:17:15
[sil.] 

02:17:20
DAN SHORT All right, so, how far into trance are you right now? 

02:17:20
ALANNAH I'm very relaxed. 

02:17:25
DAN SHORT Yeah 

02:17:30
ALANNAH I still feel very consciously aware, my... 

02:17:30
DAN SHORT Yes, you are. Would you like to go deeper into trance? 

02:17:35
ALANNAH Yes 

02:17:35
DAN SHORT All right, you closed your eyes, and then you opened them again. Do you want to have them opened or closed? 

02:17:45
ALANNAH Closed. 

02:17:45
DAN SHORT And you closed your eyes, not me. You're putting yourself in trance. 

02:17:55
[sil.] 

02:17:55
DAN SHORT Now become more aware of the rest of your body. Going into trance is a physical phenomenon; there's things that physically happen with your body. Your breathing alters. Swallowing reflex alters. 

02:18:25
[sil.] 

02:18:25
DAN SHORT Muscle tonality alt-, alt-, alters. Movement of the eyes alters. Usually, movements are small, but sometimes, they're large. That's right. Sometimes, we need to find a new place for our hands, or our arms, or our legs, or our head. There's no right or wrong. If your head stays perfectly afloat, drifting up in the air, light as a balloon, throughout the entire trance, that's right. If your head were to move to a different position, forward, backward against the chair, the side, that's right. If your hands are to stay exactly as they are right now, and this audience doesn't get to see any movement, that's right. I can be pleased with that. You can be pleased with that. Your unconscious mind can still do all the work it needs to do. It's not about performance. You are not performing for them, you're not performing for me, you're not performing for your mother, no, and you're not performing for yourself. It's discovery of potentials that exist within you. The feeling of emotion of instinct. 

02:20:20
[sil.] 

02:20:20
DAN SHORT And if your legs do reposition themselves, your hands will be forced to readjust... 

02:20:40
[sil.] 

02:20:40
DAN SHORT ...but your legs do not have to uncross, in order for the sensation in your hands to start to alter. And you do not have to see which hand it is that will be the first to go, the first to defy gravity. Yeah. Your right hand is rather eager. That's why it placed itself on top of the left. It's tired of being outdone by the left. It's your right hand that wanted to come up on this stage and show what it can do. And it does have so much potential inside of it, and you can be more in touch with this part of your body, and you don't have to force it to do anything, and you're gonna be amazed by what happens after the arm levitation, after it floats up into the air. Now, you've been communicating a great deal to me. You started communicating to me the moment you approached me without reserve, with this interest, this curiousity, this readiness to discover. There's not hesitation on your part. There's not evidence of inhibition, either. You hold yourself as someone who feels safe and confident within their own body, just wanting to know more of what they can do, ready to discover it. So, I'm gonna start to talk specifically, now, to your right hand, and if your conscious mind wants to listen, it can, or it can just go off and do its own thing, thinking of Christmas or whatever things are coming along. Your way works just fine. And so, your right hand. There you are; you stepped up on the stage. Now, it's time to do something, and I'm gonna offer some suggestions of what you can do, and you're not gonna have to do it alone; I'm willing to help. That's right. You start to notice the lightness in your pinky, already felt in your thumb, spread to the other fingers, as well. And you don't need to worry about the left hand; it'll be fine where it is. You can leave it behind, on the lap. And you're either gonna need to be the hand that goes up in the air, or at least gets out of the way, so the left hand can, but this is your opportunity to show what you can do. That's right. Without effort. Without conscious intention, these automatic movements start to occur, and you can just let them happen, and it can be a wonderful experience. It starts in the fingers. Then, it moves down to the knuckles, and on into, that's right, on into the wrist. And you're doing so much on your own, without any help from me. That's right, and your hand's becoming lighter and lighter, and it can be so easy. And I don't know how high your arm is going to go into the air, I would just like to know, in advance, it does not need to go any higher than what it is comfortable traveling. Now, Milton Erickson liked to have people slowly lift, slowly lift their hand up toward their face. And the fingers would always start, but eventually, it was the wrist that would lead the way, followed by the elbow, as a slow, jerky movement, made its way. I'm not Milton Erickson. You're not his subject. We don't need to be concerned about other people's behaviors, because that kind of comparison only sets up performance. You're not here to perform. You're not here to do things my way. You're not here to do things the way that your left brain thinks you should do them. That's right. There it goes. That's right, and that's the best place it could be right now, nestled safe, between your legs. And there are some things that you're gonna discover about you and about your hand, as it stays there... 

02:26:35
[sil.] 

02:26:35
DAN SHORT ...held safely between your two legs. And there's things to discover, not just in your hands, but in your entire body. And your awareness can go to places that you, logically, wouldn't be able to make sense of, but have meaning for you. And I appreciate what you're communicating to me right now. You're telling me some things I needed to know. 

02:27:10
[sil.] 

02:27:15
DAN SHORT I'm gonna surprise you just a little bit by taking hold of your left wrist, right here, that's right. Up it goes, up, up, up, up, up. All on it's own, lifting, lifting; just a few more inches til you find just the right height. And when you've found your equilibrium, there it will stay. And your hand's not gonna stay up in the air forever, just for a little while. As your left hand floats in the air, your right hand becomes ready to do something new. Your right hand is gonna become empowered. I don't know what it's gonna do. You don't know what it's going to do. Eventually, it's gonna have to come out from hiding. It can't stay there forever, and when it does, you'll have a new sense of courage, a new sense of readiness to deal with what's out there in the world. And slowly, so slowly, that others may not be able to see it, so slowly, the left hand will come down, and each micro movement of the left hand, more so empowers the right hand. Ever so slowly. We're not rushing anything. Change can happen at its own pace. There's new neurological pathways open up in your brain. 

02:29:10
[sil.] 

02:29:10
DAN SHORT New experiences are made available to you. That's right, ever so slowly. And the further the left hand moves, the more courage you can feel in your right hand. The more readiness it has to come out into the world and to take its place, and to show its value, and before you leave here today, I will shake your right hand. And when I embrace your right hand with my right hand, as one left-handed person to another left-handed person, you will feel something happen, and you will realize that life will, never again, be the same. Not in a grand way. It's not the grand things that make a person happy or make their life meaningful. It's the small, day-to-day pleasures. It's the smell of the air in the morning, enjoying it. It's the thought that you had before bed about what you want to do tomorrow, and how excited you are to do it. It's the laying down and realizing you've accomplished something good in a day, and that you're proud of what you did during the day. It's these little bitty moments, one after another, that makes for a happy life, and a life worth living. Now, you're left-handed, but your right hand is coming out. You know what you can achieve with your left hand, but your right hand, it has abilities, too. It wants to do things, too. And it can find its space, and it can do something more amazing than what your left hand can do. And as it comes out, I'm gonna hand to your right hand, a hypnotic pencil. Your eyes are closed, so you can't see me moving towards you, but you can feel my hand moving towards yours. You can feel my presence getting closer. I'm gonna stick a hypnotic pencil, right there, inside your thumb, right where you can hold it. Take hold of it. There ya go. Got it? There ya go. There ya go. Hold on to that pencil. I'm gonna lay in your la, a hypnotic sheet of paper, right there. Right underneath the pencil. Got it? There ya go. You're gonna do automatic writing, trance writing with that pencil. You're gonna write a message to yourself, using that pencil, writing with your right hand. Your conscious mind will not be able to see it. Only your unconscious mind will see the message that you write. You can take your time. We don't rush the unconscious. It does its thing when it's ready. We don't make demands of the unconscious. That's how you do self-hypnosis. You come to your unconscious mind humbly, with questions. You wait for it to speak to you. It will speak to you in five minutes? In ten minutes? In an hour? In two weeks? In a year - the time isn't as important. What matters is that you're listening, that you're willing to look at what your unconscious mind has written out for you. And whether it's in five minutes or five years, the experience will be profound, and you'll be glad you waited. And after you finish writing that message, you can take a good look at it. Look at it so that you can realize what its implications are, and what it means. What it came from, going all the way back to when you first learned to walk and to talk. All of these experiences, that you've accumulated over a lifetime, they're coming together in this message to yourself, and it has profound implications for your future, for what the rest of your life holds. 

02:34:40
[sil.] 

02:34:45
DAN SHORT And you can study that message, read it, and really appreciate it, and let it come into your visions and your dreams. And the dreams you dream are hypnotic dreams, and they transcend space and time, and in trance, an entire lifetime, from beginning to end, can play itself out in a moment of real-world time. There's a substantial amount that you can accomplish in just the blink of an eye. 

02:35:35
[sil.] 

02:35:35
DAN SHORT And I'm not going to bother you with my voice while you finish this work. Now, it may be, that my voice goes with you, and stays with you, far into the future. If you like my voice, if my words are helpful to you, then you can keep them for as long as you would like, and hold them anywhere inside your mind or body, and bring them out any time you need, and hear the suggestions in the way you need to hear them. Or, it may be your own voice, or the voice of other beloved in your life. I'm gonna give you some time, now, so that your unconscious mind can draw what it will from this experience, finish its reading and writing, finish its work, take the paper, and fold it up. Tuck it away. Before you come out of trance, your unconscious mind will let you know how much to share with the audience. You'll share no more or no less than what would please you leaving here, and, as you go, ans lay in your bed tonight, you'll feel very good about what you did in here, what you had to say to the audience. And the questions you either did answer, or chose not to answer. Your unconscious mind is gonna prepare you for that. And in the same way that you put yourself into this trance, when you're ready, you're gonna bring yourself out of this trance, and you'll look at me, and I'll know it's time for me to speak again. 

02:38:00
[sil.] 

02:38:00
DAN SHORT Hello 

02:38:10
ALANNAH Hi 

02:38:10
DAN SHORT How are you doing? 

02:38:10
ALANNAH I'm good. 

02:38:15
[sil.] 

02:38:15
DAN SHORT Look at your hand go up into the air, up into the air, higher, higher, higher. That's right. Very good. I forgot to tell you, you're a very capable hypnotic subject. You can do really remarkable things with hypnosis, and you're gonna be able to use this to help those beautiful children. You're gonna be able to help them do things they didn't know they could do, and you're gonna be able to go into a trance, without the children knowing it, and while in trance, you will see things that you would not see, otherwise, and you will tell them things more wise and more profound than what you would be able to do otherwise. And it's an ability you can take with you wherever you go and you can use any time you need, under any circumstances, whether it's helping others or defending yourself. And if someone were to ever try and do harm to you, your unconscious mind would take over and you would dominate that situation in such a way that would leave the other person paralyzed and unable to move before you even had time to realize what you were doing. Your unconscious mind is very capable, and it can act very quickly when it needs to. And your hand is in a good place, but it can't stay there forever. It's gonna gradually come down. You can close your eyes and enjoy the last moment of trance, and just know that, before your hand reaches your leg, you do not need to go in trance for anyone else, or even for me, unless it was the right time, the right place, the right set of circumstances, or unless you're using trance yourself to accomplish your needs and your goals and your own agenda. That's right. 

02:40:25
[sil.] 

02:40:25
DAN SHORT Hello. 

02:40:30
ALANNAH Hello 

02:40:30
DAN SHORT How are you doing? 

02:40:30
ALANNAH Good 

02:40:30
DAN SHORT Great. 

02:40:30
ALANNAH Okay 

02:40:35
DAN SHORT Is there anything that you would like to ask of me, at this point, or anything else you need from me? 

02:40:40
ALANNAH No 

02:40:40
DAN SHORT No? Good! How do you feel? 

02:40:40
ALANNAH Um, I feel really raw. 

02:40:45
DAN SHORT Raw? Yeah. 

02:40:45
ALANNAH Yeah 

02:40:45
DAN SHORT Let's give you a few more minutes, then, to put yourself back together. 

02:40:50
ALANNAH I mean, I, I feel, I feel pretty good. I feel a lot, which is uncommon, but I like. 

02:40:55
DAN SHORT Good, you feel a lot, good, you like it! 

02:40:55
ALANNAH Yeah, it was kind of a goal. That was, sort of, I mean, I, I was hoping I would be able to have something really experiential, and I didn't know what to expect, and I thought the handedness was a good avenue for that. 

02:41:10
DAN SHORT It was, it was. And do you feel you got something experiential? 

02:41:15
ALANNAH Yes! Um, I noticed that I was, like, smiling a lot. 

02:41:15
DAN SHORT Yes, you were. 

02:41:20
ALANNAH Um, and, you know, I just, I was kind of aware of, you know, this hand and this hand, and it was, like, you know, it was hiding, like my legs were kind of, like, burrow... 

02:41:30
DAN SHORT You know what? They were. 

02:41:30
ALANNAH And then, you know, you were speaking about it, and I was, like, "You petulant little child. Get out of there." I was like talking to it, like, "Get out of there. There's nothing..." but then, like, it was really warm, and I was like, no, stay. So, that was really interesting. 

02:41:40
DAN SHORT So, you ended up giving it permission to do what it needed to do? 

02:41:45
ALANNAH Yeah. I think it was, kind of, personified, like, and then, it... 

02:41:50
DAN SHORT What happened when you gave that petulant little child permission to do what it needed to do? 

02:41:55
ALANNAH Um 

02:41:55
DAN SHORT Oh, and was it a she or a he? 

02:42:00
ALANNAH It was a little girl, a little kid. 

02:42:00
DAN SHORT What happened when you gave her permission to do what she needed to do? 

02:42:05
ALANNAH Um, she was very defiant, and, sort of, like, "No." 

02:42:05
DAN SHORT She's got a strong will. 

02:42:10
ALANNAH Yeah, a little stubborn. 

02:42:10
DAN SHORT Is that to be broken or respected? 

02:42:10
ALANNAH Respected. Respected. When I, when the fingers were moving, I was like, okay, so maybe, like, maybe it's gonna 'float.' I don't know what's gonna happen, and then, whoosh. That's what it's gonna do, okay, so we'll go from there. So, that was really interesting. Um, but it felt good. I know a number of things you said, but I can't remember any of them, but I would, kind of, be questioning what was going on, and then, you would say something really reassuring about, "It could go this way or it could go this way, and we're gonna just let that happen." Um, so. 

02:42:40
DAN SHORT So, you experienced automatic movement? You didn't plan to put your hand down there? You didn't try to make it go down there? 

02:42:45
ALANNAH No, and I was really mad at it, like, "Get out of there!" Then I was like, "Well, fine, do whatever." And then I felt my eyes get all, like... 

02:42:55
DAN SHORT Yeah... 

02:42:55
ALANNAH ...woobly... 

02:42:55
DAN SHORT ...yeah 

02:42:55
ALANNAH ...and I was, like, "Just keep doing the same, whatever. I guess I'm in a trance." 

02:42:55
DAN SHORT I think I saw your eyes woobly, because there was some water coming out () 

02:43:00
ALANNAH Right, I felt it here. I was like, good thing it's on this side. 

02:43:05
DAN SHORT So you experienced automatic movement and emotional arousal. There's a wide variety of emotions, anger, maybe some sadness or something? 

02:43:15
ALANNAH Yeah 

02:43:15
DAN SHORT Yeah, and as you said, maybe you were in a trance. 

02:43:15
ALANNAH Oh, yeah. 

02:43:20
DAN SHORT That doesn't often happen. Some of those people will sit in front of me for 30 minutes, like this. I'm not exaggerating, 30 minutes. And then, they'd come out, "Did I go into a trance?" 

02:43:35
ALANNAH Mmm-hmm 

02:43:35
DAN SHORT And I say, "Well, uh, what do you think?" "I don't think I was in a trance." "Well, why not?" "Well, I remember everything you said." And it's like, "Well, your arm floated up in the air." "Well, yeah, but I think I kinda made it go up in the air." True. It's your body, your arm. "Do you normally sit for 30 minutes with your head slumped on your shoulder and your arm just suspended in the air? I mean, is that typical for you?" "Well, now that you put it that way, I guess not. Maybe something did happen." All right. Okay. So, uh, uh, we will talk to the audience a little bit. Let me reorient the time, I've got 15 minutes to, uh, take... 

02:44:15
ALANNAH I guess I have one thing about it. When you told me to come to, and then you said "Hi" and you were all friendly, but then you grabbed my hand and said something really, really intense, and then, I absorbed it, and then, I came to again and you said "Hi" in that really, really friendly voice, I thought, "He's gonna grab my hand again. What's my hand supposed to do now?" So, I guess... 

02:44:40
DAN SHORT Your hand's on its own, at this point. It's gotta fly solo. 

02:44:40
ALANNAH Um, and so, I guess, I would be curious as to that, sort of, not that it was, like, a, like, a 'trick' ending, but then I'm guessing there was something really intentional about that whole, you know, that intervention or addition or whatever you want to call it. 

02:45:00
DAN SHORT I like the way you're asserting your rights up here. You were the one that had the courage, and was willing to take the risk to come up here, on stage, and provide this opportunity for everyone. So, actually, it is your right to be the first person to ask me a question. So, I like that. Um... 

02:45:15
ALANNAH And I've got a mic. 

02:45:15
DAN SHORT ...one, and you've got a mic, so you've got a certain amount of power, given that. Uh, one of the things that Milton Erickson said, was that, uh, "Often, it'll be the second trance that is more profound for individuals than the first. And then, there's that, sort of, jarring, sometimes, and this is his old stuff, back when he wrote the book with Irvin Sector and all those, on medical hypnosis. They were doing some more, and it looked like classical hypnosis, but it had some counting techniques, and so, they would start counting, to wake people up, you know, "You're gonna wake up when we get to ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, five, four, going deeper and deeper, three, two," and they thought hypnosis was over, "One, and you go deep into trance." So the brain was going this way, and all the sudden it just. I had people, I've done that before, and people have described it like their train just suddenly stopped, and all the cars went "crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch," you know, but, they don't know what to do next, and they don't know what's expected of them, and they don't know what they should do. And that moment of utter confusing, uh, of utter confusion, and not knowing what they should do, that is when you've really shifted away from left brain to right brain, and you're really engaging another part of the brain that exists in emotional reality and instantaneous action, not planned action. Entirely spontaneous. Why is spontaneous thinking and doing important in therapy? Well, because the person's come to us, already having a set pattern of behavior, sequential behaviors, and they know what's happening. And, in their own head, they know, even if they think they shouldn't be doing what they're doing, they know why they shouldn't be doing what they're doing, right? And, so, you're not wanting intentional behavior from the client, you're wanting spontaneous, previously undiscovered responses from the patient, and wanting to recognize a capacity for that. That sounded really abstract. I'm sorry for that. Okay. An-, an-, anymore questions? 

02:47:15
ALANNAH No, that makes, that makes sense. And that was, I mean, that what was what I was really interested in, what you were discussing, it's just, like, specifically communicating to the right brain, and it, it's a different language; it hears something different than what words are being spoken, and then, it gets really abstract and bizarre, and so that, that makes a lot of sense, that, that would be the, sort of, like, like, that, if you, like, cut the cords of an elevator and you just drop down a shaft in the right brain, and it was just really intense, and like... 

02:47:45
DAN SHORT Right. 

02:47:45
ALANNAH ...different communication. 

02:47:45
DAN SHORT Right, exactly. 

02:47:45
ALANNAH Cuz I was, cuz that's what it felt like, a freight train. It was just, like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't even know what's going on right now," cuz I didn't know what was going on right now. But, like, my right brain was right there... 

02:47:55
DAN SHORT Right 

02:47:55
ALANNAH So, that was pretty awful. 

02:48:00
DAN SHORT So, how many people, in the audience, think I had this whole thing planned out in advance? Right. That's a stupid idea! Thanks for raising your hand. It's a stupid idea to think you're gonna plan out, in advance, everything you're gonna do with a client. Ah, I'm sorry. There's people in here who like to work that way, but, it, it's not a very potent way of working. You need to, therapy has, Erickson himself, and many of the researchers, right now, are saying therapy has to do everything with interpersonal connection. Researchers in hypnosis are saying, uh, hypnosis has everything to do with interpersonal connection. Interpersonal connection does not exist if you preplan the relationship. That's formality. That's being the queen and going through all the gestures. I mean, you don't know the person, in state of formality and practiced behavior. You have to go into a place of discovery, of spontaneity, not knowing what you're gonna say until you say it. Of not knowing that you're gonna shake her hand and put her in a second trance until you shake her hand and put her in a second trance. That's where you're really relating to the individual. That's when you've allowed a different part of your brain, right hemisphere, picking up on non-verbals. The enti-, I guarantee you - I have no way of proving this scientifically - I guarantee you the entire time a client's with you in the office, they're trying to tell you what to do to help them. They're trying to tell you how to do hypnosis with them. The trick is just hearing it, or seeing it. You're not gonna be able to logically figure it all out; it's too impossible of a task. But, there's gonna be another part of your brain that is figuring out some things. And if you'll allow that part of your brain the chance to give you some spontaneous behavior, and then, there's research on that, I do know. Uh, where they've compared, uh, therapies that have been done with using a manual, a treatment manual, uh, uh, and then, where people are given no permission, you have to follow the manual exactly. Uh, and another group where they were given permission to veer from the manual whenever they wanted to and be spontaneous, and, you get way better outcomes. Not terms, uh, just in terms of satisfaction, but symptom resolution and whatnot, with, cuz you have better, better alliance, better client connection with the therapist, when the therapist is willing to get to know the client, and have a real relationship. Yes, sir? 

02:50:20
UNKNOWN I, I just had a qu-, a response to what you're saying right now, because, when, in the first part of the trance, you said to her, that, at some point, you were gonna shake her right hand. That per-, one lead to another, you were gonna shake her right hand... 

02:50:35
DAN SHORT Yes 

02:50:35
UNKNOWN ...and then, you wanted to experience something, you said, I, something big, so, at, at that point, had you planned on the second trance, or was it not until you shook her hand that you planned it? 

02:50:45
DAN SHORT No, not until she told me she was ready to go into a second trance. So, uh, when I said I was gonna shake her hand and everything, that was just, kind of, an truism thing, you know? Like, when I'm talking to my child, I'm telling him, "You will go to bed," you know. I wasn't gonna say goodbye to her and not shake her hand, you know? And, I'm a lefty. Yeah. I'm a lefty, a dyslexic lefty, and, uh, I, uh, uh, uh, I, but I've been trained in the world of rightys, to shake with the right hand. She's been trained to shake with the right hand. We were gonna say goodbye. We were gonna shake with the right hand, so, while there's a little bit of a truism, that post-hypnotic suggestion, but then, there was a greater opportunity that presented itself, and was clearly, in my head, the right thing to do. Okay. Great question. 

02:51:35
[sil.] 

02:51:35
UNKNOWN Can you explain how you knew it was another opportunity? 

02:51:40
DAN SHORT How I knew it was... 

02:51:40
UNKNOWN That there was another opportunity to do more? 

02:51:45
DAN SHORT Yeah. Her overall demeanor, was one of, to me, openness and receptivity. She used the word raw. I don't know what she means by the word raw, as the same thing what I mean by openness and receptivity, but I felt, kind of, uh, this going on. Not something I can explain, entirely, in left brain logic, but, certainly I was picking up on it as if there, there was still an openness. There was still more room for me to interject more energy into what she was doing. And what she was doing, she was so lovely, why not do it a little more? Okay, okay. Good. That was an okay answer? Okay. Good. Uh, uh, let's see, anybody else? Go up to the mic if you have a question. They, okay, I'll restate your question, just make sure I can hear it. 

02:52:40
UNKNOWN You started off, in your introduction, talking about going into trance yourself. I think you had been talking about an aspect of that experience, but could you say a little bit more about your experience... 

02:52:55
DAN SHORT Yeah. Uh, my, well, let me talk about my, one of my favorite experiences was when I was, uh, in college. I like to take classes that were more complicated than what I was really, intellectually capable of doing, uh, and I had done that in high school and collected a series of F's, but I don't think I had, I didn't have things quite figured - no, no, no, I did in high school too. I remember one kid came up to me one day, and he was like, "I hate you, with your smart-alec self and wearing your shades and class, uh, putting your head down on the desk, and going to sleep while the teacher's talking," uh, and something. I can't remember what his last comment was, and he walked away from me. And I was like, well, you know, the teacher didn't tell me not to wear sunglasses in class, I did-, uh, and, uh, I would sleep each class, but, yet, when she was in Geometry, she would come back with the test, she always allowed, uh, you to take extra credit; she'd have these bonus questions at the end, or things she hadn't taught to, and if you could answer it, you'd get a 110, or whatever, on your test. I'd always get 110 on my test. Uh, and, um, then, in college, uh, I took a class in philosophy. I loved the professor. He'd come from Princeton. Uh, this man was a brilliant philosopher, and I'd always sit on the front row, and my goal, every class, was to stay awake. And I remember, literally, kind of, holding my eyelids, and I'd be like this, and just start sinking, like, you know, and I tried, I tried, and I'd just end up on the desk, pencil on the ground, you know, and my desk, well, anyway. But, I, uh, on his exams, I always made the highest scores, and I came around the corner one day, when he was talking to a professor, and I think he was talking about me. He must've been, cuz he said, "I think he likes my classes. He turns up for every one I teach. He sits on the front row, but he sleeps through every single one." And then, I had an experience with, uh, the, uh, class on anatomy and physiology, and this was for people with advanced classes. I'd skipped all the prerequisite control classes. I just, kind of, landed myself in it. That's, kind of, my 'thing.' So, I landed myself in this class. I sat on the front row, and I had a very kind nurse, old-, she was older, and she, kind of, took me on like a son or something. So, when my head would go down on the ground, as soon as he would turn his back, she'd put an elbow into my ribs, and pop back up. And he would start talking, and then I'd go to sleep sitting up, you know, and so, uh, that was how we did the first semester. And, he didn't have any tests until the semester exam, after the semester exam, he called me into his office, and he said, "I want you to know, I was gonna take your, uh, test to the Dean, and have you, uh, kicked out of, of, of class, for, uh, cheating, because, uh, you made one of the highest scores in the class, and, uh, I know you can't have gotten it from your book, because that, that, uh, test was full of thin-, of questions I lectured on, and the only way you could've gotten the answer was from lecture. Well, what I, I haven't used this test before. It's a brand new test. So what I did, was I looked at all of the tests of the people who sat around you, and you got questions right that they got wrong. So you can't have copied from them. So, I want to know how you did this." And I was like, "Man, I got one of the highest grades in the class?" He said "yeah," I was like, "Cool." He was like, "well, how did you do that?" and I was like, "I don't know. That's cool." So, later, after I learned more about hypnosis, and I read about Erickson working with his graduate students, and he would tell them, or his audiences at home. He'd have some slumped over in the audience. It doesn't matter that Dr., Dr. So-and-So came to my lectures, and he always likes to go into a trance while I'm speaking. It doesn't matter, cuz he'll get just as much, or more, than the rest of the audience. And, uh, I would start, uh, my classes by telling my graduate students, you know, my name, and what I do. I'm practicing hypnosis, and to me it really makes no difference whether they listen to me with their head up and their eyes open, or their head down on the desk. I'll teach to 'em just the same. It's quite all right if your head goes down on the desk. I think it's a perfectly legitimate way of learning information. Every once in a while I'd be lecturing, one of them would have their head on their desk, and suddenly, I would stop making my point, and they would pop up, and they would realize and they'd get this look on their face. They would just go white, like, "Oh, no!" Oh. And these individuals would do fine on their tests; they would know the answers to the things I'd been saying while they were. Why shouldn't we expect it to work that way? Erickson talked about doing hypnosis, or going into trance, while he worked with some clients, and, sometimes, the client challenging him for being in a trance the entire time. And Erickson saying, "Well, I have some notes, here. After we're done, I'll go back and I'll read my notes, and I'll know what's happened in this session." Evidently, he had amnesia, post-hypnotic amnesia for his own trance experiences while he worked with the client. He did that quite often. He was willing to do it. He was willing to let his left brain go offline a little bit and not totally track everything he was saying and doing. Why shouldn't we? I've never been in such a profound trance, during therapy, that I didn't remember the session, at the end of it. Just pieces, all, kind of, loose, sometimes, I lose track of, and I , I don't remember what I said, and I don't remember what they asked me, but the client is moved, clearly, and, clearly, has just heard something that, that's shook their world. Did that answer the question? Uh, you asked me, more specifically, about me going into a trance here. I was leading the way for the members of the audience to go into a trance. Initially, my trance induction was, the first person I sought to do a trance induction with was myself. Why not calm myself down? Why not relax? Why not open up to other parts of my brain that could be very useful in this kind of experience? The second people I focus on during a trance induction is the audience. Why not invite some people in the audience to access other parts of their brain, where they can do more deep and profound learning than what might be achieved under ordinary circumstances. Then, I got to the person I would be focusing on, and she was already working on putting herself into a trance. I already invi-, it was a collaborative endeavor; it wasn't me making her go into trance. I just joined her in what she was doing when everybody else had been taken care of. Mmm-kay? We're, we've got time. We've got three or four minutes, by my watch. Uh, you can, also, answer, ask questions of the subject, too, if you want. Or, of me. 

03:00:25
UNKNOWN I have another question in response to what you just said, because, when you began the whole thing by saying you were going to use, an approach, or trance, you hadn't used before. You said something about that... 

03:00:35
DAN SHORT Yeah 

03:00:35
UNKNOWN ...that was different. I thought, that, what you were doing, by asking her to make herself comfortable, trance-ready, and then talking to us, I thought that was a way of communicating with her. Making her, making the subject feel comfortable and taking, taking the focus away from her, in a way that allowed her to use her own inner resources to. I thought that that's what you were doing. 

03:01:00
DAN SHORT Yes, of course. Uh, uh, you. It was rather brilliant, too, wasn't it? Uh, as, as with metaphors, metaphors are things with multiple meanings, and, even your actions become metaphors. And the action of shaking her hand suddenly takes on multiple meanings. And, you know, just like a John Lennon song can take on multiple meanings, and, meanings that John Lennon wasn't aware of, initially, but then, later, he realizes the rest of it is there. Uh, you know you're being guided by the logic and reason of your right brain, when things come to you in stories, and the stories are guiding your actions. So, I, uh, my mind's listening to her, I'm watching her, I'm trying to be as tuned-in to the situation as I can, as I'm deciding how I'm going to do my trance induction. And, a story that came to mind is one of Jay Hailey, and Jay Hailey was talking about one of the times he watched Milton Erickson do hypnosis with a man, and, uh, he said it was one of the most amazing things he had ever seen. Uh, he got a volunteer from the audience, and he said, uh, Erickson brought the man up, onto the stage, told the man where to stand, had him face the audience, and get himself ready to go into a trance, and then he started talking to the audience. He didn't talk to the man anymore. And, Jay said he was watching the man, just suddenly, and he said it was clear the person was in a deep trance. Uh, and he says, "This was remarkable! I was watching Erickson put this man in a trance without even talking to him!" And, uh, I think, either Jay Hailey had this explanation, or he talked to Erickson, later, and Erickson gave this explanation about what was happening there, and it was expectancy. He was brought up on stage to do something. Uh, Erickson was no longer talking to him, he was just facing the audience. He had to do something. His job was to go into a trance; he didn't know what else to do. So, he went into a trance. Uh, and Erickson, it was a permissive move. Erickson did not take the man over, did not make the man go into a trance. He allowed the man to find his own way to go into a trance. That story popped into my head in a few milliseconds, right before you saw me do what I did, and turn to her, and turn to the audience, and left her sitting there, to complete her own expectations and her own efforts in putting herself in a trance. So, that came from my right brain, not my left brain. Cuz it was story that just flashed in my head, all the sudden. Yeah? Go ahead. 

03:03:40
UNKNOWN I know there's brief time, here. Um, you're talking about falling asleep in class, and still getting the material, which, I hope, does work, myself, a whole lot. Spurred by this thought I've been wondering about, but haven't heard about in recent years. I heard about it years ago. Do you think we could, while people are asleep, we could just run a heap of suggestions, and just run suggestions that would have the same impact, but I don't hear about that, um. 

03:04:05
DAN SHORT Yeah. My first experimenting with self-hypnosis, and this is before having read anything about it. I was an insecure kid in, uh, sophomore year of high school. I was nervous, I was shy, I had never kissed a girl. I was just wanting to be a fly on the wall. And, uh, I thought, "You know, I'm gonna think about how I'd like to feel and how I'd like to be, and I'm gonna keep saying it to myself, as many times as I could, til I fall asleep. And so, I laid there in bed, at night, saying messages to myself about, oh, I don't know, worthiness of being, of confidence in engaging others, something to offer the world, or whatever - I don't know what my 15 or 14-year-old brain came up with, whatever age I was then. And, I said 'em again and again to myself, until I fell asleep, and, when I, I had all these wild dreams. My dreams kept on with what message I'd been giving myself before I go to bed, right? Uh, anxious people do this in a negative way, before they go to bed, and they dream, and they wake up really disaster. It starts with the thinking they're doing before they go to sleep. I was doing the opposite of that. And I woke up, and I felt different. By golly, I felt different, and I put on my clothes, and they're the same clothes I had before, but I wore them differently. And, I was walking in between classes and I had one of my best friends, he's still my best friend, today. He's known me since I was in fifth grade. He said, "Okay. What's going on? You are not the same person I know." He said, I even had less acne that morning, by golly, I am not kidding! So, my face looked a little different. Uh, and, uh, he said, "You are not the same Dan I know. What's going on?" I just, kind of, smiled and, kind of, walked on by, and that was my first, uh, experimentation with self-hypnosis. And, uh, a very simple, easy thing to do, just repeat something to yourself again and again, and you end up dreaming about it during the night. Uh, um, I've never done recordings with myself or with, I've done it with my patients. Uh, I have a hi-, high-definition type recorder in my office, so when I'm doing hypnosis with someone, I'll ask them, if you're gonna want this later on. I set it right next to them and I'm talking to them, but there's a mic right there and it picks it up, so they can, so they can listen to it later. And, some of them like to listen to it as they're going to sleep or during the night. Now, I made that available to them, especially if they're having problems with insomnia or whatnot. Uh, a little, kind of, note, here. I record all my sessions with a lousy mic that's in the. I don't talk with people unless they sign a release that says they know how I keep records, and rather than writing notes the whole time, there's, my computer is recording it. And, that way, there's no accusations about doing something while they were out and have amnesia for it, and, whether or not things were done that were unsafe, or whatever. I once did have a husband call me up and wanted to know 'what the hell I was doing with his wife?' or whatnot, and I was like, "Well," cuz she had said all these bizarre things to him, and he was ready, I don't know, to take legal action or whatever, and I was like, "I can't say whether or not your wife is a client of mine without a release, but, if she'll bring you in, we'll sit and listen to the recording. It's recorded from beginning to end. You can listen to it." and I didn't hear anything else from them. There was no further problem after that, once he went back to his wife and mentioned that it's recorded. I know I've gotta end. I've so much enjoyed my time with you guys. I'm sorry it had to end now. I hope you have a great day! 

03:07:35
Camillo Lorieodo, M.D., Ph.D. 

03:07:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO Thank you for coming. Uh, what we will do today is a demonstration of hypnosis with a family. Um, I don't know how many of you have used hypnosis with families, but, uh, yeah, let me know, how many. Well, not so many, not so many. Uh, some of you will use only hypnosis. Just hypnosis, how many? More. And, how many just family therapy? Okay, so, we have more many family therapies than other groups. So, uh, uh, for a family therapist to think in terms of hypnosis is not too difficult, because, as you well know, many family therapists has been credited for doing hypnosis without knowing about it, and, uh, for example, Carl Whitaker, uh, was one of those. He say to me that, "Everybody's telling me that you are uh, uh, doing hypnosis," and I never studied that. I don't know anything about that, but, nevertheless, probably I use it without knowing. It's, uh, something that can happen very frequently with families. Families are the place in which hypnosis was developed, many, many centuries ago, and, every mother knows how to make the child sleep, and every mother knows how to convince, uh, a child to, uh, to stay at home, or not to go out of the country. Um, the, the idea of influencing other people comes from the family. Uh, you don't have any reason to marry, if you don't think to change your partner. No? So, usually, you marry with the project of doing the therapy to someone else, and, and the other people, they think they will make, uh, therapy to you, so you marry. So, Carl Whitaker was also saying that there's a double family therapy, so that your family is sending you to do therapy on another family. So, that's another view that you may have with, uh, family therapy. But, uh, whoever it was in hypnotica, in, in a session with a family, even without hypnosis, has the experience of having gone in hypnosis, because, if you stay for a while with a family therapy, it's the old, same things that you, and with couples. Even more, no? Like, yes, yes, yes. So, this is why family therapy, the offices, the institutes of family therapy have terrible chairs, like those ones. These ones, they belong to the psychoanalyst, so, so you can tell, from the very beginning, if you are in an institute of family therapy, because the chairs are uncomfortable, because you don't want to go in hypnosis, and then, if their chairs are comfortable, it's less easy to go in trance. So, that's for defense of the therapist. Uh, so, not to undergo hypnosis too frequently during this session, but family therapists is very active because you, you want to induce change. So, we know a lot about change. We have change 1, change 2, different books about change, so that, the family therapist is very, very active, in the first few sessions. Then, after a while, like this, so, the experience of hypnosis comes up, uh, with experience of families, but the idea why I decide to do hypnosis with families come from, from the Director of my institute. That, one day, he called me and say, "Well, I am in front of a family and there is, uh, the child is asking for hypnosis. Would you like to do hypnosis to the child?" I say, "Well, uh, that's okay. Maybe, on Monday?" He say, "No, no, no. What I would like you to do, is do hypnosis now, by phone." That idea was crazy, but he was my Director. I don't know what you do with your 'chiefs,' in your experience, but I said, "Yes, okay." So, uh, he asked me to, to doing the actual induction to the child. At my phone, I was trying to do the induction, and, uh, I started to speak to him, and I said, "Well, I will do hypnosis to you. Listen to me," and so on, and after a while, I heard that he was changing the rate of his breathing, and after a while, I say to him, some things - I didn't know what the hypnosis was for - but, um, I concluded my session by saying to him, "Now, you can open your eyes and, uh, make, take a deep breath, and you can, you'll reenter yourself." Then, I was curious, but I didn't know anything because I didn't have any idea what was happening in the session. But, the next day, I interviewed the Director of my Department, and, he say to me, "Well, it was very good." I say, "In what sense?" I think the boy went into hypnosis. He said, "Yes," but he had to mention that the entire family went into hypnosis. So, I discovered that watching the child, that family could go into hypnosis all together. So, if you have the idea of doing hypnosis to a family, the way of beginning is, to select a child, and, to say to them, "Pay attention to the child." It's very easy for them. They already pay a lot of attention to the child. So, so, it's like, you win before, before you begin the battle. You win immediately, so it's very easy. There are many other techniques. I won't have time today to explain to you all of them, so I want to, to use hypnosis with this family; this role play family, because they're not a real one. But, uh, we, we can, uh, say it from the very beginning that we will be, uh, a fake family, but real hypnosis, okay? So, so, uh, they, they will be whoever they want to be, but they are expected to go in trance, anyway. Uh, the induction can be done several ways. Many of my colleagues in family therapy, they do informal inductions. They speak and have a conversation with the family, but, I discovered that the formal one can give you much more opportunities. So, I explain to the family that I want them to go into hypnosis. I ask their permission. I allow to the people to go inside hypnosis or not; they can decide. And, they can decide at whatever moment. For example, one can say, in the beginning, "I don't want to go into hypnosis," but then, participate later. So, if, uh, I have only one client that's going into hypnosis, I can do hypnosis to that client, in front of the family. So, the client might have hypnosis, uh, formal hypnosis, and the rest of the family may have an informal one. So, it's up to them. I leave them, uh, all the freedom I can. Uh, sometime, it happens, a process inside the family, in which, the family is asking to the people who are more resistant to participate, like, a child that say to the mother was reluctant to go in hypnosis. "I don't want to go. I want to control everything." So, you say to the mother, "Well, we cannot do this treatment without you. You should [music]come with us. Go ahead and do hypnosis with us." So, the, the, the mother obeyed to the child, no, to me. So, when I ask her, she say, "No," when the child ask her, she said, "Yes," so, that, those are dynamics that are very interesting in family therapy. I don't have to explain to all of you those things, but, uh, you'll realize. So, I'll do a formal induction of hypnosis, not an informal one. It's possible to do an informal one, but, I prefer that a family's informed and I have to ter-, to have their consent to go in hypnosis. So, usually, and if they know, they go more deeply, and, uh, they are happy to know that, so that everything gets open and clear, and you didn't make any special trick, just work with them in a very open way. I am not, uh, so strategic to think 'I want them to do this without telling them.' I prefer to be very honest and sincere and explain to them what I'm doing from the very beginning. So, that's why I'm formal, and I think the family repays me with a lot of participation, and, uh, they feel, in some way, that they've not been betrayed, or, uh, they're not in front of the therapist that tries to take advantage of hypnosis without saying to them that he's doing or not. Okay. So, I don't want to add any other words unless you have a specific question to do before we start? Maybe I can only take one or two? I-, if you don't have them, that's okay. I, I will start, and maybe, we can make questions after, okay? So, uh, I don't know anything about the family. I, usually, I do, with my, uh, um, subjects, or clients in demonstrations. I prefer to discover, because, this way, what happens when they come to you and does the real-, real situation, is the situation in which they never come, can come to your practice, and, uh, you cannot decide if it is good or not. Usually, the patients, they understand very well. They are good patients for you, and, uh, if they don't like you, they don't come back, so, it's up to them, but for them, we don't have this problem. Okay. Thank you. I'm glad to know you. I'm Camillo Lorieodo...

CAMILLO LORIEODO On-, once, once I, I come in United States, I learn new things. Okay. 

03:20:50
[sil.] 

03:20:50
'COLLEEN' Um, I'm Colleen, and I'm about 55, um, my passion is looking after my house and my family. 

03:21:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO What? I didn't understand, sorry. 

03:21:05
'COLLEEN' My passion is looking after my house and my family. 

03:21:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO With your family? 

03:21:10
'COLLEEN' Mmm-hmm 

03:21:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, so you have patients all inside your family. 

03:21:15
'COLLEEN' Yep. Lots of... 

03:21:15
CAMILLO LORIEODO Nothing outside? 

03:21:20
'COLLEEN' Um, outside, I just like to exercise and... 

03:21:20
CAMILLO LORIEODO Exercise 

03:21:25
'COLLEEN' ...keep fit... 

03:21:25
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah. Okay 

03:21:25
'COLLEEN' ...and look after my garden 

03:21:25
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, and what do you do in your life? 

03:21:30
'COLLEEN' I look after my family. 

03:21:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Ah, okay. So, most part of your, uh, life, is dedicated to your family. 

03:21:35
'COLLEEN' Absolutely. 

03:21:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Absolutely. 

03:21:40
'COLLEEN' I'm a good mother. 

03:21:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, okay. Colleen is your name? 

03:21:40
'COLLEEN' Mmm-hmm 

03:21:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, thank you. Uh, and you are the mother, I suppose? 

03:21:45
'LANA' Yes, she is. 

03:21:50
'COLLEEN' She's 29? 

03:21:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. You have been elected as the mother. 

03:21:55
'BILL' So, I'm Bill. Down? Okay. So, I'm Bill. I'm 64. 

03:22:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Excuse me, repeat your name? 

03:22:05
'BILL' Bill 

03:22:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Bill. Bill. 

03:22:05
'BILL' Bill. I'm 64. 

03:22:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO 64 

03:22:10
'BILL' Uh, I'm a lawyer, and, um, my passion is sailing. 

03:22:15
CAMILLO LORIEODO Sailing. You have time to practice it? 

03:22:20
'BILL' Now and then. 

03:22:20
CAMILLO LORIEODO Now and then. 

03:22:20
'BILL' Not too often. 

03:22:25
CAMILLO LORIEODO Not too often. So, you, you dream about sailing, sometime? 

03:22:25
'BILL' Oh, all the time. 

03:22:25
CAMILLO LORIEODO All the time? 

03:22:25
'BILL' All the time. 

03:22:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO All the time. And, uh, are you practicing as a lawyer? 

03:22:35
'BILL' Yes 

03:22:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yes. And, what kind of law are you interested in? 

03:22:40
'BILL' Um, um, Malpractice. 

03:22:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Malpractice? 

03:22:45
[sil.] 

03:22:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay 

03:22:50
'BILL' I'm sorry, I couldn't resist that. 

03:22:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. Okay, thank you. It was nice to know you, and I would like to know, now, why did you ask for family therapy? 

03:23:10
[sil.] 

03:23:10
'ELAINA' I'm just sick and tired of the way they treat me. You know? I'm 29 years old, and they treat me like a big baby. I mean, I'm tired of it. Just because I still live at home, I can't help that. I don't have a job. It's hard to get a job right now. 

03:23:30
'LANA' Yeah, and all they care about is my school performance. They don't care about me or my passion. It's all just, "Get good grades. Get a good job. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah." I, I, they don't know anything about me. 

03:23:45
[sil.] 

03:23:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO Did the family come because of the daughters? So, was decided by them to come to family therapy? 

03:24:00
'COLLEEN' Apparently. I, I had no idea they felt that way about this. 

03:24:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO No? 

03:24:05
'COLLEEN' No, it's a shock. 

03:24:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO It's a shock for you? 

03:24:05
'COLLEEN' Big shocker. I've worked hard for these girls. I've given my life up for these girls. That's all I can say. 

03:24:15
'LANA' Oh, I feel so bad for you. 

03:24:20
'BILL' You know, I think she's got a good point. I mean, we're only concerned with these two girls getting out on their own. It's tough out there. The economy's really bad. Um, they're gonna have to. We're not gonna be around forever, and they have to be able to function on their own, and, you know, we're both trying, in any way we can, to make them able to be self-sufficient and out in the world and be safe and function and, and be okay. And, you know, I, you know, Colleen does her best, and we just got a hard time, you know. 

03:25:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Mmm-hmm. So, you, are you suggesting to them to be more autonomous? 

03:25:05
'BILL' Well, that's our goal. 

03:25:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

03:25:05
'BILL' We'd like them to be, we'd like them to be able to be more at-, I'm not sure they're ready, but. 

03:25:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO But, do you know that, the more you ask for autonomy, the less autonomy they become? 

03:25:20
'BILL' Well, I hadn't thought about that, but it could be true. 

03:25:20
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, okay. So, uh, so the real reason why you came is? 

03:25:30
'BILL' Well, for me, I'd like to see less conflict. 

03:25:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Less conflict. 

03:25:35
'BILL' It just is, you know, I come home from work. It's tough, and, uh, I have a very demanding job, and I, I'd like there to be some peace... 

03:25:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay 

03:25:40
'BILL' ...in our family, you know, a little more harmonious at home. 

03:25:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, that's your request. 

03:25:50
[sil.] 

03:25:50
'ELAINA' Maybe, if you quit yelling at us of all the time, there would be more harmony. 

03:26:00
[sil.] 

03:26:00
'COLLEEN' And my goal is, that, I want the girls to leave home, because I'm ready to have a life with my husband. It's time, and we're entitled and due, aren't we? 

03:26:15
'BILL' Absolutely, absolutely. 

03:26:15
'COLLEEN' We've got plans. 

03:26:20
'BILL' Absolutely 

03:26:20
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. What, what is your goal? 

03:26:30
'LANA' Well, I'd, I'd like to be more supported and feel more supported and feel like you guys really care about my well being and my happiness, and not just about what matters to you, but, what deeply matters to me. 

03:26:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. What is your goal? 

03:26:50
[sil.] 

03:26:50
'ELAINA' I just want them to be more understanding. I mean, they yell at me all the time. I mean, I can't help it I can't get a job. I have a career, but I can't find one - the market's bad, you know? And, they just yell at me. They set me a curfew. I mean, I'm not gonna be in at any curfew. I'll stay out as late as I want. 

03:27:10
[sil.] 

03:27:15
'COLLEEN' Um, when you've got the family car, it's a problem, because your father wants to go to work at seven o'clock in the morning., and he needs the car. 

03:27:25
[sil.] 

03:27:25
'ELAINA' You know, that was just one time. You know, you just bring up things over and over again, doesn't she? 

03:27:35
'LANA' Yeah. They really like to rub our nose in things, I must say. 

03:27:45
[sil.] 

03:27:45
'BILL' I mean, come on. You're 20 years old, you're 29 years old, I'm supposed to be understanding, supportive, and not criticize anything. We've done 29 years of child raising. I'm 64 years old. You know, I think it's about time I have, and, Colleen and I have, some time of our own, where we don't have to be focused on you guys, and, I think we're being pretty, I understand it's hard to get a job out there, now, but, we're, we're giving you food and shelter at a time when, by ordinary standards, you should be out there supporting yourselves. I would think you could at least have the courtesy of respecting our needs at this point in our lives. You're not little kids, anymore. I'm just sayin'. 

03:28:40
[sil.] 

03:28:40
'LANA' I see anger behind that. Well, I think, maybe, if you guys had done a better job, then, then we wouldn't need you so much right now. It's not like you can just 'check out' when we turn 20. 

03:29:00
'BILL' I can't wait for you to have kids. 

03:29:05
[sil.] 

03:29:05
'ELAINA' I mean, I'm gone all night long. You have all the time in the world to spend together. I, I don't really get it, and you always nag me when I'm home. 

03:29:25
[sil.] 

03:29:25
'COLLEEN' Um, I'm quite happy to stop nagging you, if you leave home. What, what I'm saying is, I am done. 

03:29:40
[sil.] 

03:29:40
'COLLEEN' I believe we've done a good job, and that job will support you where you're going, and we wish you all the best. 

03:29:50
[sil.] 

03:29:50
'BILL' And excuse me, why should Colleen have to do your dishes? Why should Colleen have to do your laundry? Why should she be providing these services for you, at your age? You, you say we're nagging? Just, you know, pull your share around the house, and, you'll have less nagging. 

03:30:15
[sil.] 

03:30:25
'LANA' Wh-, what do you have to say, Dr. Lorieodo? 

03:30:30
[sil.] 

03:30:30
'LANA' I mean, this is what we do all the time, at home. I mean, I didn't want to just come in here, and, do the the same thing over and over again. Right? Wouldn't you say, Elaine? 

03:30:40
'ELAINA' Yeah. Cuz we, you know, we clean the house, you don't even notice. I cleaned up the kitchen yesterday. Not a word, and, uh, you just never notice anything that we do. 

03:30:50
'LANA' Yeah, or that. 

03:30:55
'ELAINA' And what do you do? You don't even work. You've never worked. 

03:31:00
[sil.] 

03:31:00
'LANA' And what kind of a model is that? 

03:31:05
[sil.] 

03:31:10
'COLLEEN' Now you've really upset me and showed me how ungrateful you are. 

03:31:15
[sil.] 

03:31:15
'COLLEEN' I do lots of work around the house, don't I? I do all the work. 

03:31:20
'BILL' Do you think raising you two wasn't work? 

03:31:20
'COLLEEN' Yeah, they're really difficult. Especially, remember what they were like in high school? And, remember what we had to put up with? It just went on and on, didn't it? 

03:31:35
'ELAINA' And you're on all those pills all the time, too. All you do is sleep. 

03:31:45
[sil.] 

03:31:50
'LANA' W-, w-, we're here, though, to, I, I feel like we're getting stuck again. We're here to try to do things differently. 

03:32:00
[sil.] 

03:32:00
'COLLEEN' Well, I wouldn't need the pills if we didn't have all these people at home. And we need to agree, uh, are we wanting them to leave home? I certainly would be happy for them to leave home, but you seem to think, say it'd be okay for them to stay. 

03:32:15
'BILL' You know, I, I would like them to leave home, but, you know, some of the immaturity doesn't make me confident that they're gonna be okay out there. So, it's like, I wish they were ready, but I just get the feeling they're not. 

03:32:35
'COLLEEN' You've never thought that they're ready. 

03:32:40
'BILL' Well, that's cuz I don't think they're ready. 

03:32:45
'LANA' I mean, I would really love it if you guys could have more faith in us. 

03:32:50
[sil.] 

03:32:50
'COLLEEN' I do have faith in you. I believe you'll be okay if you leave home. Well, I know we will be. 

03:33:00
'LANA' Dad just said we're not ready. 

03:33:00
'COLLEEN' See? Here we go again. 

03:33:10
'ELAINA' Where are we supposed to go, out on the street? Dad understands us way better than you do. He's much kinder to us, and he's always been that way. Even though, you don't even work, and you stay home and take those pills. 

03:33:30
[sil.] 

03:33:30
'COLLEEN' The doctor says I'll have to stay on the pills, as long as you two are here. 

03:33:40
[sil.] 

03:33:40
'COLLEEN' And they're only Vitamin B, anyway. 

03:33:45
[sil.] 

03:33:45
'BILL' Well, if I could just hear a detailed plan, of wha-, for you guys to get out, get your own place to live, get a job, be self-supporting, I might feel that you were more ready. 

03:34:00
'COLLEEN' By Christmas? 

03:34:00
'BILL' You know, I don't know what to... 

03:34:00
'COLLEEN' New Years? 

03:34:00
'BILL' Hmm? 

03:34:05
'COLLEEN' By Christmas, or by New Years? 

03:34:05
'BILL' Well, whenever, whenever. 

03:34:05
'COLLEEN' But whenever's not good enough for me. 

03:34:10
'LANA' And this just doesn't feel good. You're telling us that we can't handle being out on our own, and Mom, you're telling us, "Get out, yesterday." 

03:34:20
'COLLEEN' No, Christmas or New Year. 

03:34:25
[sil.] 

03:34:30
'ELAINA' Dad. Dad, we're making a plan. We've had a plan. We really can't help it. I mean, it's rough out there. We don't have money. 

03:34:40
'LANA' No 

03:34:40
'ELAINA' She's only 20 years old, and I've worked, and I can't find a job. There's just nothin' out there right now. 

03:34:50
[sil.] 

03:35:00
'BILL' I think, Lana, you know, she's still in school, so, that makes some sense to me, but I think you could find something - if you really looked. 

03:35:10
[sil.] 

03:35:10
'COLLEEN' When I was your age, I scrubbed dishes. 

03:35:15
[sil.] 

03:35:15
'LANA' Ye-, there's that lack of faith, again. 

03:35:25
'ELAINA' When you were my age, there were jobs, still; there was an open job market. Now, it's really tough. 

03:35:35
[sil.] 

03:35:35
'COLLEEN' I can't remember when you last had a job. There was only a few, weren't there? And that was a long time ago. 

03:35:50
'BILL' I know it's tough out there, but, you know, maybe if you weren't partying quite so much, out all night long, and sleeping in so late, you could be out job hunting, might, you know, so, if you don't have a job, put your energy into looking for one. Is that too much to expect? 

03:36:10
[sil.] 

03:36:10
'COLLEEN' We've had this conversation before. We had this conversation last year. She's still hasn't found a job, and I think it's gonna be me, or them. 

03:36:25
[sil.] 

03:36:25
'ELAINA' Well, I'm not puttin' up with this. You guys, I mean, Dad's understanding, you aren't. You don't even work. I mean, that's just not right. I've been looking on the internet all the time for jobs. 

03:36:45
[sil.] 

03:36:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. No,no, it's okay. I have mine. Uh, we can continue forever. It, it looks like an Italian family, because, uh, in our country, the children live in the family for a long, long, long time. And now that we have financial problems, it's even longer. Here, in United States, there's a tradition that children leave home very soon. Very, very soon. But, this is not happening in your family, so, you have an Italianization of your family. I'm sorry about that. But, uh, I can assure you that, that if you live in Italy, the problem will be shared with many, many, many families. 

03:37:35
'BILL' I lived in England for a year, so I know what you're talking about. 

03:37:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO So 

03:37:40
'ELAINA' It's here, too, now. 

03:37:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah. Here, too, now, but I think it's a process that has gone, now, all over the world, huh? So, the separation from the children, uh, it's very difficult, in general, and, it is becoming more difficult, now. So, I don't know if I can help you, or not, because this is not the process the therapist should deal by his own, his own, because, uh, you know, we cannot decide whether or not you have to marry, or, you have to, to live alone, or to live, together, with other people. It's not a task that a therapist should complete, uh, in, in some way. But, nevertheless, I, I think you asked for some more serenity, calmness, less conflict, and things like that. So, my proposal to you is, uh, if you, you want to take advantage of, uh, a hypnotic induction, dedicated to the entire family. So, if you would like to participate to the, uh, hypnosis, uh, I'm working with hypnosis with families, and in this case, since we cannot deal with the decision, the final decision, and, you are the ones in charge for the decision, because, whenever you want, you can decide, "Well, we will not pay anymore; you're saying to leave or stay." and so, that's your decision, anyway. But, the fact you have less comfort about that will not be, uh, in some way, a danger. It will be helpful, because the situation in which people are less exasperated, and, uh, angry. Uh, it will, uh, will, uh, create some new opportunities, and probably, less tensions means, also, new opportunities to find a job, or, to, to find a period in which you can stay alone, without interference of the children, that, I think, it's a part of your desire to do it. So, uh, so, my proposal is that you, with this specific goal, hypnosis to the entire family. If you accept, tell me, "Yes," each one of you. 

03:40:00
'ELAINA' Yes 

03:40:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yes? And Lila, Lana? Yes? And, Colleen? Bill? 

03:40:05
'BILL' I'm willing to try. 

03:40:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. Thank you, thank you. So, all of you will participate, today, in the induction. So, what I'm asking to you, is just make something very simple. Put yourself in a very comfortable position, whatever you consider to be comfort today. Okay. You can stay with open eyes, or with closed eyes, as you like. It's up to you. Now, just listen to what I say to you, and in case, I will put your question respond to it. Just imagine, in your mind, that, for a moment, you are getting rid of the problems of the family. Each one should think about himself, or herself, for a while. Uh, and Elaina, since you ply-, you play tennis, you like that. That can be a way to think about yourself. To your physical presence in a, a tennis game, to the experience of enjoying playing tennis, inside yourself. The family is away, and you are alone, playing your favorite game, and enjoying being there. 

03:41:35
[sil.] 

03:41:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO And Lana, you can do whatever you want, but, my suggestion is to concentrate on the pleasure of dancing. A steady dance, if you, if you like, but please put yourself there. The rest of the family is not here; you have to be yourself. Putting needs first, in fact, is the first thing that we discover as soon as we know families, that in order to be able to stay together in an active way, you should learn to be alone. So, this is the first part of our induction. And you, Colleen... 

03:42:35
[sil.] 

03:42:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO ...you can think about the exercising process that you like more. Exercise without thinking or being with the rest of the families. Just be yourself. Your sensations are the most important part of this moment. And you, Bill, can go sailing with your mind, enjoying being there, the wind, the smelling of the sea, the possibility to feel alone, since a long time, and enjoying being there. 

03:43:30
[sil.] 

03:43:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. So, since I trust your experience, and I see that you are able to involve yourself, in each one in his or her own individual, preferred passion. Now, I will like you to take still for a few minutes to yourself. 

03:44:05
[sil.] 

03:44:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. Deeply. And then, there is time, now, to do the rest. Now you feel quiet and serene. Now you can be only yourself, and there is no need to resent of what happens around you. No need. Just enjoy the experience of being by yourself. Ah, when you can do that so well that you are satisfied, just move a little bit, one of your hands. So, if you, Elaina, satisfied with yourself, before we go to the family process, then just le-, give me a little sign with one of your hands. Just, I see one finger moving, it's okay. Now, Lana, whenever you are ready. Just let me know, but, the little movement of one of your hands. Okay, I've seen another finger. Okay, and, Colleen? Okay, thank you. And, Bill? Okay. That's good. So, since you are now ready to think about the family again, in the beginning of our session, you saw that there were many problems, conflicts, different opinions, accusations. 

03:46:00
[sil.] 

03:46:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Well, this is part of the family life; I don't want to eliminate these completely, but, to reduce it can be very helpful. So, just imagine that you are doing your normal practice of the sport, of the activity, or the passion you like more, and then imagine to slow it, like, with a slow motion. So, imagine play tennis with a slow motion and, the same, you can do with dance, and, the same, you can do with exercise. And, the same you can, Bill, with sailboat, or sailboat. Go very slow, and, you will see that everything can be more easy, because it's slow. In tennis, you will have time to see where the ball goes, and then you can respond immediately, in a perfect way. So, everything will slow down, even the process of the conflicts in your family. And now, you are ready to slow down the interaction that are happening to you, in your family. No more need to be fast and to respond immediately, like you did before. Every word received a fast response, without little think, little time to think, and to understand, well, what you received from the others. Now, you can go in a process of slow motions as words and of physical interaction. Very slow. No hurry. No need to respond automatically, but time to think. So, my imagination goes to the idea that you have the opportunity to play together, the same kind of passion with your family, so you can imagine, for the moment, Elaina, to play tennis with your family, but in a way that is not for winning, not for losing, but is a way, to enjoy with them, the process of playing so slow, so slow. You know their moves because there's time to understand, and they can play with you, slowly, in order to give you time. And dancing together with your family will be your part, Lana, and, everybody can dance the way he or she likes. And you can dance with them in a very slow way. And also for you, Colleen. Everybody can exercise together with you. That's a pleasure you enjoy, but with your family, and they can participate, together, with you. And sailing with the others will be Bill's fantasy. And since it's not so easy like being alone, I give you some more time to adapt to the new situation. When you live, when you live with others, you should adapt to each other, so the adaptation time takes time. 

03:50:25
[sil.] 

03:50:25
CAMILLO LORIEODO And now, since you had the possibility to make an imaginations, Bob, your preferred passion, together with others? 

03:50:35
'BILL' No 

03:50:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO We will reach the third level in which you will be able to enjoy being together in a trip, so, each one of you can have his or her own fantasy of a trip together, being in the same place, but everybody can decide which place he or she likes. So, the trip is starting, now, and you can go wherever you want to go, but, with the possibility to share, again, with the family members. And, this will be a ways in the very slow way. The trip will be very slow. Time to think, time to relax, time to feel and to understand your feelings. When you are in a hurry, you don't have time to understand, properly, what you feel. So, hypnosis is a good opportunity to slow down, and to understand, better, the feelings. So, imagine a trip in which you have this opportunity, together, with others. Okay. Now, this is difficult, because to plan a vacation, or a trip all together, is not exactly what I imagine that this family is able to do, normally, but this is a special trip. A fantastic trip with slow motion, and, during the trip, you have to remember that concentration on ourselves would be important, to be together with others. Remember that each individual, who is able to stand by his own, develops a great ability to stay together with others. So, enjoy being yourself, and then, you will enjoy to be a member of the family. 

03:53:05
[sil.] 

03:53:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO The trip will have a very short time, although it is done very slowly. And then, at the end of the trip, you will realize that your experience changed a lot, your perspective about yourself and about the family. Now, before to wake you up, I will like each one of you to say a phrase dedicated to the family that will summarize the new perspective that you have reached during this process. So, whenever one of you is ready. Just le-, give me a sign with your hand, just a little move, and I will give you the possibility to say the phrase. Just one phrase. Slowly. Okay. Colleen. 

03:54:20
'COLLEEN' This time, it's ready for new ground rules. 

03:54:25
UNKNOWN What? 

03:54:30
[sil.] 

03:54:30
'COLLEEN' This time, it's ready for new ground rules. 

03:54:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, thank you. 

03:54:50
'LANA' All we need is love. 

03:54:55
[sil.] 

03:55:00
'BILL' Well practiced crew. 

03:55:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. Okay. Thank you. Give to them, that. 

03:55:10
[sil.] 

03:55:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO Thank you. Now, you opened your eyes already, but, we'll take some time, more, to go completely out. And, uh, I will count from three to one, and the entire family will be out of the trance when I say one. Three, two, one. Okay. Your eyes are already open, and if you have any specific comment or request, you can do that. 

03:55:50
'BILL' I didn't hear what you said. 

03:55:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO If you have any comment or request that you would like to make. Forwards, please. 

03:56:00
'COLLEEN' I've got some comments. You and I want to have a life together, and I think we can do that. You, if we treat you as a University student, who had left home, and we lived our life, as if she was a University student, who's capable and independent, we might change the way we are. And, I think it's time you moved into the garage. It's all nicely set up, and I'm sure you can do the modifications. Um, and you became independent. You get your welfare payments. Um, I believe you could do that. And as for you, I believe it's time you took me sailing. That's what I want. 

03:56:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. 

03:57:00
[sil.] 

03:57:00
'LANA' Are we commenting on our experience, or? 

03:57:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Whatever 

03:57:00
'LANA' Anything? 

03:57:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO Whatever you think is fine. 

03:57:10
'LANA' Well, it was a little tricky, because, we were, you know, going into hypnosis on our 'fake' family, but also, images of our real family is what come up, right? Um, so, you know, I was, kind of, going back and forth between those two things, but the part I liked the best, was, slowing things down. Um, I found that, that felt really, really good, just to be able to do that. And, I think gave me some insight. 

03:57:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay, thank you. 

03:57:50
'ELAINA' Uh, I would agree. I mean, I think, uh, the trance helped me to, uh, look at things in a different way. 

03:58:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO I have my wha-, uh, you look like you don't have any more words, you were speaking so much before?What happened to you? 

03:58:10
'ELAINA' I don't think she wants to hear it, what I have to say. 

03:58:15
CAMILLO LORIEODO All right. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, but, this was only the first session, so, I enjoyed being with you, and I think the process has slowed a little bit down, but, I think there are many more other expectation and changes that you can work on, during this time, until we meet for the next time. It's okay, it was a pleasure meeting you. 

03:58:40
'ELAINA' Thank you 

03:58:40
CAMILLO LORIEODO Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. 

03:58:50
[sil.] 

03:58:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO Okay. I take, if you have any questions, as we have one minute or two - no more than that. 

03:59:00
[sil.] 

03:59:00
CAMILLO LORIEODO Please, go to... 

03:59:00
UNKNOWN Um, would that be, um, your general... 

03:59:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Go to the mic 

03:59:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, here. 

03:59:10
UNKNOWN Okay, now, I think it's, it's very interesting, even though it was a role play... 

03:59:20
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

03:59:20
UNKNOWN ...uh, it reminded me, um, a lot about Mexican families, like, you said Italian. Uh, in Mexico, we don't tend to think that our kids will leave home. 

03:59:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

03:59:35
UNKNOWN And, in my own experience, I am living that now. Uh, my kids, well, I have a 19-year-old daughter, and, and she left home earlier, than what we thought, so it's been very interesting to see the different cultures here, played, and, and how, even though it's a role play, we can identify a lot with what's going on, and, and with what you did, it's like, if, if I was working, also, on my own, with my own family. So, thank you very much. 

04:00:05
CAMILLO LORIEODO Thanks to you. My comment to this is, that, we will see more and more families like this, and this is a good, uh, picture of the present time, and, uh, what we can do, because I don't think we can solve the economy with, uh, psychotherapy. Although, sometime, it could be useful for some, but, uh, you know, that's, my ethic is that I don't say to the family, "Your children should go away," or, "They should remain at home." Like I do with couples, I never suggest to them to split or stay together, but I try to help when they have decided what to do. I can't help them in the process of decision, but, just some things they should do. But, what I think is important, is that, uh, if the world is really changing in this direction, we have to be more sensitive to something that we forgot, since a long time. So, to listen more to each other. So, to be in the same family, and to be forced to stay together for a longer time than before, will oblige us to discuss together, things that, uh, the fact that the family was splitting, and several different connections within the time to do that. So, my, my problem with this family was that I imagine for, uh, uh, that, that this will be the future for many of us, and, uh, the family will not leave so easily, like they did in the past, and so, the confrontation between parents and children will be stronger in the future. So, that's my comment to the child situation, because I think this is a picture of what the family of the future, please. 

04:01:50
UNKNOWN I wanted, Dr. Lorieodo, to see if you'd say something about the power dynamics in this family. It seems like a matriarchy. 

04:01:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

04:01:55
UNKNOWN Yeah 

04:01:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah. It, it, it is like, you know, how, how, uh, powerful are the people who discuss very strongly, but there is also the passive strongness of someone who is, uh, on one side and doesn't move, like, the passive patients I usually teach, no? They are very powerful because everybody should do what they to do, and so, so there is another kind of power. So, there are powers that the are the, come out from the being, very active, and, uh, request strongly, and there is the power of other. So, in the family we have both, the power of the so-called impotence, and the power of, uh, the matriarchal power. Uh, but, uh, you see, their, their real problem is probably, in this family, many, many other occasion happens, it was between father and mother were not in agreement, but, as far as we have seen, the, the most part of the power was, in the end, with the mother, but, the final decision that the children should leave was on the part of the father. So, it was the impotent mother of the family. He obtained, that they remained there, was more adamant for them to stay, than to leave. But, I didn't want to be on either part because this is of the couple, uh, that they have to deal with by themselves, so, the, the, the, "Who is winning?" Well, of course, there is an operant winning. If they will leave, then she will, uh, win, and, uh, if they will not, uh, leave, he will win, but, it will be a real winning, if they don't leave in a way that is really ha-, a new relationship with the parents, so that was my concern. Try to teach to them that it's better, not so much, to leave or not to leave, but to develop a new kind of relationship, okay? So, I think some, in some parts, the message was accepted. In some other parts, no. 

04:04:05
PAZIOSO Hi, I come with relations. I am Pazioso from Mexico, 

04:04:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO Uh-huh 

04:04:10
PAZIOSO I wanted to congratulate you in the, in the straight way that you, eh, about the techniques. From the beginning, they were in trance, where you say, I think that you, well, you said, eh, "Okay, we're going to be in trance, but before this, tell me what you like to do." They were already in trance. 

04:04:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

04:04:30
PAZIOSO Is that correct? 

04:04:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO It is, it is partly correct, yes, because, because, in my assumption, when you speak about hypnosis for a long time, the context for hypnosis is already. There are many people go in hypnosis very sudden, so, eh, immediately, and some of them will. Some will... 

04:04:45
PAZIOSO Yeah 

04:04:45
CAMILLO LORIEODO ...but not often. 

04:04:50
PAZIOSO Al-, also speaking about the, the techniques. 

04:04:50
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yes. 

04:04:50
PAZIOSO First of all, you made them to slow down. 

04:04:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

04:04:55
PAZIOSO Then, to dance in their own way. Yes. And to invite the family to, to, to adopt themself, all the, all the family to themself. 

04:05:10
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yes 

04:05:10
PAZIOSO And then, to feel comfortable, to heal the spirit, and to make, uh... 

04:05:15
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah 

04:05:15
PAZIOSO ...uh, dance together. My question is, if it's correct, and they, the way that you ask them to feel well, to feel comfortable, and to heal the spirit, was this the goal? 

04:05:30
CAMILLO LORIEODO Yeah. The, the... 

04:05:30
PAZIOSO And this is what you showed the, tried to do? 

04:05:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO Well, I, I tried to take in account all the goals of the family proposed to me, and I want to have less conflict. And, to have less conflict, of course, to me, well, the meaning was that this and more to each other, and to have time to listen. And, if they were so fast, like they were in the beginning, when it was silent, they were having interaction very fast. Each one would, to the other; you don't have time to think about what you say, and, it's an immediate reaction. So, I wanted to, them to slow down, and to have time to listen more carefully. That was my, my main goal. And, uh, the other principle was, to develop individual quality, because, when the family is too much attached and too much involved with each other, it means that the indi-, individuality didn't develop so much before. So, to think about yourself, is a preparation for a, a weaning from the family. I think, that's the last one, that's okay. 

04:06:30
UNKNOWN Would you address younger children? And, how young of children would you include in family therapy? 

04:06:35
CAMILLO LORIEODO Um, even very young, three years, four years old. Uh, they can participate to the family, uh, induction, together, because, you should have specific techniques of children, of course, but, uh, they can participate to the entire family induction, since they are three or four. Huh? 

04:06:55
UNKNOWN How do you deal with younger children? 

04:06:55
CAMILLO LORIEODO Well, of course, there are several different techniques, even with hypnosis with families, I only showed you one technique. I couldn't do more because the, we only have one demonstration, but, uh, you, you can use play, for example, no? And, you can use fables. Fables are okay for the children, but they are okay for the grownups too, so, you adapt to the lower age to extend the hypnosis to the entire family. So, you tell them fables that can fit with the children, and then, the fables, we'll adapt those to the entire family. I'm sorry, I think we have to stop. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

Brent Geary, Ph.D. 

04:08:10
BRENT GEARY Those of you who have been hearing me at the conference, here, and those of you who have been in trainings with me in the past, know that a lot of my focus, in hypnosis, and a lot of the focus of anybody who practices hypnosis, but sometimes, not so consciously focused, is on dissociation. And so, I want you to be active participants, here, and not just sit, slack-jawed and mouth-breathing, and watch the demonstration, but actually use your little mentee, and watch for elements of dissociation. Um, if you were in the fundamental track the other day, you'd know that there's a model of dissociation, that's been around for many years, called the BASK Model. Behavior, affect, sensation, or knowledge. Can't be separated off from normal consciousness, which is really just what dissociation is. Um, so, in hypnosis, sometimes, we're dissociating behaviors, sometimes, we're dissociating affects, sometimes we're dissociating sensation and or knowledge. I, several years ago, thought that this was incomplete and added something, extra. I thought that there was more to dissociation, and added M.O.R.E., which is movement, orientation and optimism, both of the O's, I think, are almost equally appropriate. So, movement, orientation, resources, and energy, and I think, these are the elements that are implicit and the things that we are utilizing when we are doing hypnosis. Certainly, all of the hypnotic phenomena, w-, are dependent on dissociation in one form or another, and to one extent or another. So, with BASK MORE in your mind, with dissociation in your brain, and looking at the demonstration through this lens, please watch for what's happening in terms of dissociation and, and as we talk about the issue before, what is involved with regard to dissociation, what might be going on that, that Kim would like to improve. No. Behavior, affect, sensation, knowledge. Movement, orientation and optimism, resources, and energy. There's a little bit of a draft, here. Are you, is it okay for you? Are you comfortable? 

04:10:45
KIM I'm okay. 

04:10:45
BRENT GEARY Okay. Um, did you wanna clip that up onto your? Oh, you already got it. Okay. 

04:10:55
KIM Got it. 

04:10:55
BRENT GEARY And, okay. So, in a nutshell, so to speak, what is it that prompted you to be interested in sitting here with me? 

04:11:00
KIM Um, through, listening through the different lectures and everything, one of the things I have become very aware of is, how much I struggle with control, even though I don't want to think I'm a control freak; I think I might be. Um, but just having... 

04:11:20
UNKNOWN We can't hear her 

04:11:20
BRENT GEARY Maybe, if you put it up just a little bit. 

04:11:25
[sil.] 

04:11:25
KIM Maybe, on my necklace. Is that better? 

04:11:30
BRENT GEARY Testing - I think it is. Testing, one, two, three, four, five. 

04:11:35
KIM Testing, one, two, three, four, five. Oh, its got to be... 

04:11:35
BRENT GEARY Is that better? 

04:11:40
KIM Better here? 

04:11:40
KIM I'm holding it. 

04:11:40
BRENT GEARY Don't let them control you. 

04:11:45
[sil.] 

04:11:45
KIM Stop! Um, so, I just started to notice how much I, I struggle with this, in my life, and I realized that, it affects me physically. Um, I workout, I practice yoga, um, avidly, and, I'm a Vegan, so, I eat a very healthy diet. I'm very conscientious of my nutrition and things, and, I have had digestion issues. I've gone to doctors, GI doctors, had a colonoscopy when I was 36 years old, no one can figure out what the issue is. No, they just say, "We don't, we don't know," and it just, in the last two days, listening to all this stuff, I think I started thinking, I think it's, maybe, it's this piece of control, of always trying to keep it all together, hold it all together. Have everything on track. 

04:12:30
BRENT GEARY Is this the first time the control started to come into your mind? 

04:12:35
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:12:35
BRENT GEARY Okay. How are you explaining it before? 

04:12:40
KIM Um, I think I just always felt that I was having a lot of stress. I think I just attributed it to I just have a lot of stress. 

04:12:50
BRENT GEARY Okay 

04:12:50
KIM I have three kids, a private practice, you know, um, I just always figured I was always under a lot of pressure. I never thought that it had something to do with control, and, I don't even really know how it relates to it, but, it just feels very strongly, that, this is something about controlling of, I don't know what. 

04:13:10
BRENT GEARY Okay, and, and since control has emerged as a hypothesis... 

04:13:15
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:13:15
BRENT GEARY ...what other shifts, in your thinking, or, your musings, or your reactions, have occurred? 

04:13:25
[sil.] 

04:13:25
KIM Um, I don't wanna feel this way. You know, my, my friend, Doug, we were sitting at lunch, and he said, "You talk fast all the time." And, I've always joked, I should be an auctioneer, or something, as opposed to a therapist. I think I might be a better auctioneer, but, um, it just makes me sad. I don't want, I don't want to feel this way, all the time. I don't want to feel so tight and pressured and always having to keep everything so 'together.' 

04:13:50
BRENT GEARY When are, when are you least under stress? 

04:13:55
KIM When I'm practicing yoga. 

04:13:55
BRENT GEARY Okay. And, what does yoga do for you? 

04:14:00
KIM Um, it gets me out of my hut. 

04:14:00
BRENT GEARY Okay. And, how does it do that? 

04:14:05
KIM Um, well, in yoga, you learn to focus on your breathing, on your breath, but, to notice different parts of your body, and to focus on being in the present moment. And, for some reason, I can go into a yoga class and get there. You know, be in that present moment, be on my mat, and, it's just me. Even if I'm in a room with 60 people, I don't notice that, but, everywhere else in my life, I'm aware of everything else that's going on, all the time. It's like my brain doesn't shut off. 

04:14:40
BRENT GEARY Mmm-hmm, and how much experience do you have with hypnosis? 

04:14:40
KIM Um, I got trained, I think, the first time, five years ago, and I've gone to some different trainings, and then, just through what I've read, or what I've learned from my friend Doug, and, that. 

04:14:55
BRENT GEARY Do you practice hypnosis... 

04:14:55
KIM Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

04:14:55
BRENT GEARY ...in your, in your therapy? 

04:14:55
KIM With certain things that I'm comfortable with, but then, I stay away from others. 

04:15:00
BRENT GEARY Do you do self-hypnosis? 

04:15:05
KIM Um, I think so, but I'm not sure. I've done self-hypnosis in regards to pain. I've gotten tattooed and I found a way to tune out from the pain. But, other than that, I don't, I don't know if I have; I don't think so. 

04:15:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. Uh, do you have animals? 

04:15:20
KIM Two dogs, mmm-hmm. 

04:15:20
BRENT GEARY And, uh, what are their names? 

04:15:25
KIM Trouble and Tucker. Trouble, yes. 

04:15:30
BRENT GEARY The Terrible T's, huh? 

04:15:30
KIM Uh-huh. Trouble and Tucker, yeah. 

04:15:30
BRENT GEARY Okay, and, anything else you enjoy doing, other than the yoga? 

04:15:35
KIM Um, oh, I love to cook. I love, I love, love, love to cook, and I love to cook for people, and, um, to entertain... 

04:15:45
BRENT GEARY Mmm-hmm 

04:15:45
KIM ...and spend time with my friends, and read, and, bike ride - anything physical. I love doing physical things and being outside and that kind of thing. 

04:15:55
BRENT GEARY Where did you grow up? 

04:15:55
KIM Um, originally, in Southern California, and then, we moved to the Midwest, to Chicago, and that's where I live now. 

04:16:00
BRENT GEARY Okay, all right. 

04:16:00
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:16:00
BRENT GEARY How long have you been in Chicago? 

04:16:05
KIM Mmm, since I was 12, and I'm 40 now, so, a long time, yeah. 

04:16:10
BRENT GEARY More of a Chicagoian... 

04:16:10
KIM More of a Chicagoian, yeah. 

04:16:10
BRENT GEARY ...than a So Cal. 

04:16:10
KIM Yeah, although, I keep denying that part. I'm really not a Southern California girl, no, I'm a Chicagoian. 

04:16:15
BRENT GEARY Uh-huh. 

04:16:15
KIM Yeah 

04:16:20
BRENT GEARY What do you have in mind that would be something helpful we could do, here? That would boost the, the hypothesis theory that you have about control, or, that would help you in the future, or, something tangible, that would happen here? 

04:16:35
KIM To learn to be okay not being in control. To not feel like I have to have control all the time, I think. 

04:16:40
BRENT GEARY Okay, you already know that, but that really happens... 

04:16:45
KIM Okay 

04:16:45
BRENT GEARY ...that really happens outside of here. So, what can we do, in the next twenty or twenty-five minutes, here, that would help you with that. Let's just window it down a little bit. I'm, it's not a bad... 

04:16:55
KIM Mmm 

04:16:55
BRENT GEARY ...uh, objective, and like I say, you already know how to do that. So, uh, maybe we can amplify that, but if we narrowed it down to something right here, right now, that could happen, that could be helpful for you, what would it be? 

04:17:10
KIM Um, help me to calm my stomach. 

04:17:10
BRENT GEARY Calm your stomach? 

04:17:10
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:17:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. And, 10 being the worst of your stomach ever is, and 1 being your stomach's just fine, where would it be right now? 

04:17:25
KIM A 7. 

04:17:25
BRENT GEARY Okay. And, when you're doing the yoga, you mentioned focusing on, on certain parts of your body being helpful to you. And, are there certain parts of your body that you can talk about, in front of a mixed audience, that would be, that are most helpful for ya to, to focus on? 

04:17:45
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:17:45
BRENT GEARY Okay. You wanna say what they are, or do you wanna just keep it to yourself? 

04:17:45
KIM Um, in terms of, we-, in which aspect? 

04:17:50
BRENT GEARY Where, where, where you focus in your, you say, by focusing on parts of your body, this is something that helps you to be able to let go, and to, to separate from the daily stresses and things. I mean, is it the bottom of your feet that you focus upon, or is it the muscles in your shoulders, or... 

04:18:05
KIM Um, more, it's like an awareness of what's happening in my body, and then, wherever I notice tension, like, visualizing breath going to that area. 

04:18:15
BRENT GEARY Okay 

04:18:15
KIM That's what I'll do. 

04:18:20
BRENT GEARY Perfect. All right. I'm probably not gonna repeat that, but that's something that you know how to do... 

04:18:25
KIM Okay 

04:18:25
BRENT GEARY ...and on your own, even while I'm talking to you. If, at any time, you think that, that would be something that'd be helpful for you, please do that. 

04:18:30
KIM Okay 

04:18:30
BRENT GEARY Okay? Because, it's a, it's a extent strategy that you have that's helpful and successful, that I hope you'll utilize during anything else we might do. 

04:18:40
KIM Okay 

04:18:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. So, the stomach, shall we call it sensation, or, stomach upset? How do you, how do you refer to it? 

04:18:50
KIM It's like a constant gnawing, and, it's like a... 

04:18:55
BRENT GEARY Gnawing? 

04:18:55
KIM Gnawing, yes. 

04:18:55
BRENT GEARY Okay, so, if the gnawing's at a 7 right now... 

04:19:00
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:19:00
BRENT GEARY ...and, in the work that we do here, together, we're able to lower that to a 5, would that be something that would help, be helpful for you? 

04:19:05
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:19:05
BRENT GEARY Now, we're, we don't have to stop at 5, but, I'm almost able to guarantee you that we'll be able to bring the 7 down to a 5. How much father down you would like it to be, is really... 

04:19:15
KIM 1, 0. 

04:19:20
BRENT GEARY Well, not 0, can't have 0. 

04:19:20
KIM Okay, 1. I'd, I'd, I'd... 

04:19:25
BRENT GEARY That would be nice... 

04:19:25
KIM Yeah 

04:19:25
BRENT GEARY ...but let's, let's expect 2. 

04:19:25
KIM Okay 

04:19:30
BRENT GEARY Okay? And then, anything else that happens is just... 

04:19:30
KIM Gravy 

04:19:30
BRENT GEARY ...extra added benefit. Well, I wasn't gonna say that, because, gravy can be hard on the stomach, sometimes. 

04:19:40
[sil.] 

04:19:40
BRENT GEARY So... 

04:19:40
KIM It's true. 

04:19:40
BRENT GEARY ...there's a lot of fat in it... 

04:19:40
KIM Yeah 

04:19:40
BRENT GEARY ...and some of it's animal material, so you probably don't eat gravy, anyway. 

04:19:45
KIM No 

04:19:45
BRENT GEARY So, so it wouldn't be gravy for you. So anything extra, will be an added benefit, right? 

04:19:50
KIM Right 

04:19:50
BRENT GEARY Okay. All right. So, anything, eh, have you, have you seen or heard anything at this Congress, that, that in terms of hypnosis, itself, has been particularly interesting to you? 

04:20:05
KIM Lots, I've heard. Um, uh, I wouldn't even know what to say, what I've heard, cuz there's been so much, like, my brain is just overwhelmed with information right now. 

04:20:15
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

04:20:15
KIM A lot 

04:20:20
BRENT GEARY All right. So, in the way that you do at the yoga class, you think that you would be able to focus sufficiently so that most, not all, but most awareness of the, cashew gallery, outta here? 

04:20:30
KIM Oh, I can tune it out. 

04:20:35
BRENT GEARY Okay, they, are they already gone? 

04:20:35
KIM Not yet, but... 

04:20:35
BRENT GEARY Okay 

04:20:35
KIM ...I can tune it out. 

04:20:35
BRENT GEARY They will be. 

04:20:35
KIM They will be. 

04:20:35
BRENT GEARY All right. With your permission, I'm gonna take your left hand, and just gonna lift it up in the air. That's all I'm gonna do, and, what I'd like you to do is, just find a spot on your left hand. 

04:20:45
KIM Okay 

04:20:50
BRENT GEARY It can be on the wrist, it can be on a, a fingernail or something. 

04:20:50
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:20:50
BRENT GEARY Now, I'm gonna take my hand away, so, you're gonna keep the hand up there... 

04:20:55
KIM Okay 

04:20:55
BRENT GEARY ...but what I'd like you to do, is, as you would like to go into the hypnosis, because I want you to be in control of the, the pace and the rate at which you decide to go into the hypnosis. What I'd like you to do, is just allow this arm to gradually, gently, drift back down, and you might wanna, just, not go too fast. Take a moment, and take one, or two, or three nice, easy breaths, right now. That's right. Now, you might notice, also, that, sometimes, when I'm touching your hand, it's almost as if I'm holding it up, but then, when I let loose of the hand, and there's a different type of sensation, and a whole different, responsibility, so to speak, you have. So, I'm gonna take my hand away now, and, in a nice, gradual pace - don't go too fast, don't go too slow - just at your own pace. Again, this hand will just drift back down, toward your leg, and while it does that, I'm just gonna remind you of some things that you already know about, but these reminders can be facilitative for you to relax and absorb, and to feel yourself going inside. You notice that, as that hand moves up and down a little bit, when you inhale, sometimes, it comes up, and then it goes down. And, of course, it's drifting down, a little bit at a time, as you absorb yourself. There are different things, even while you're looking at the hand, that you can see. There's the black background, out of the periphery of your vision. You might see me, you might see my lips moving, as I talk to you, and these are things, that, more and more will leave your awareness, as you focus and decide, in addition, to that hand coming down at your own pace, when it is that you'll want to close your eyes. And if you do close your eyes before the hand is down, I'll just make sure, sitting here, that, that the hand comes down on your leg. You don't have to worry about it missing your leg, or anything like that. You feel the chair supporting you, beneath you and behind you, and maybe, already, you've noticed how there are certain parts of your body, that become more and more comfortable, even ahead of other parts, and I certainly don't know which ones those are. But you can notice them, whether they're the muscles in your forehead or your cheeks. Little muscles that you sometimes don't even notice are there but you do a lot with during the day, and when you allow them to relax, it's a nice noticeable sensation. Or whether it's the muscles in the right arm, that's just resting there as the left arm drifts down - more than halfway down, now - and ca-, allows you to know and allows me to know the rate of absorption that you are accomplishing. And there are sounds, the sound of my voice, other sounds that will come and go. There's that, kind of, constant, subtle sound of the air conditioning that you can notice, as well. That's right, make any sort of adjustments in your posture, the orientation of your head, or any other place in your body. You feel that contact? That's right. Just let the hand come down. Focus on the sensations in your left hand, your left arm, your left shoulder, and notice how that part of your body joins the rest, in this comfort and in these nice sensations, that, can support and promote the enhancement of your experience, so that what can happen here, can be the best possible thing to happen for you. Now, it's almost as if that left hand, that left arm, that indicated the process, by which you are going into trance, that, really, was an external indication of the control that you were exercising in letting muscles relax, changing the flow of your blood through the veins and arteries and capillaries. The modifications that you are making in your neurological system, and even the modifications, as you relax, and focus, and feel more and more comfort allowed to occur in the gastrointestinal system, because, when you enter into hypnosis, when you enliven this process within you, all of the systems of the body respond in a positive way. And so, there's a part of you that exercises a different type of control, because, control means a lot of things. You can control the traffic with a light. You can control the direction of a ship with a rudder. You can control the movements of a dog with a leash. But, there's an unconscious control that you have that automatically sets these alterations into motion, within you. You don't think about relaxation. You don't think about trance. You don't think about calmness and comfort as motion, but indeed, they are, because, down at the cellular level, there's a different motion, and, at the level of the neuronal synapses, there's a different motion. And within the muscles, and within your lungs, and within the intestines, there's a different motion that occurs, because this unconscious control that you have. And so, when you exercise this unconscious control, like you're doing now, like you do when you perform the yoga, like you do at other times, when you allow yourself to separate from what's bothersome, what's nettling, what makes you go fast, what might be gnawing at your mind, or elsewhere. When you exercise that control, there's a great deal of motion that's involved. Now, I don't know whether or not you've ever had the experience of being somewhere, in your home, in your backyard, on a balcony, and you're doing something. Maybe you're cooking, maybe you're reading, maybe you're talking to your children, and there's an idea, there's an image, there's something in the back of your mind. Now, certainly, you can't say it's the furthest thing from your mind, because, whoever knows what the farthest thing from your mind is, because as soon as you think about what's the farthest thing from your mind, it's the closest thing to your mind. But there's something gnawing away at the back of your mind; an idea, something that has a little element of excitement to it, a little positive element to it, but you're engaged, you're occupied, and something else. Maybe there's even been a time, around your home, when you've been doing something, there's a little noise, and you say to yourself, "What's that noise?" It's familiar, but you can't quite place it, immediately. Maybe you look around a little bit, and you turn a corner, there is one of the dogs, gnawing on something. Now, often, when we look at dogs, and they're gnawing on a bone, they're gnawing on a toy, they're gnawing on something, there's a lot of activity, and it's hard to think that probably, that dog is, acutally, despite all that activity, doing something very positive and very productive, something good for the teeth, something good for the dog's mind, whatever it might be, dogs don't gnaw for nothing. And that idea, that image, that thought that's gnawing at the back of your mind, that has that 'pull', that draw, that positivity, that curiosity, that wonderment about it, can sometimes emerge and have a new meaning, a different way of being in your mind, or even in your body. Once you just stop... 

04:31:50
[sil.] 

04:31:50
BRENT GEARY ...and reflect... 

04:31:55
[sil.] 

04:31:55
BRENT GEARY ...and let it come. Now, some people refer to this as intuition. Some people refer to this as an 'Aha!' experience. Some people refer to this as insight. Some peole don't know exactly what to say about it. And, it doesn't really matter what you call it, because when that idea comes, when that idea emerges, when you exercise the control, when you take hold of the rudder of the ship, when you pull back upon the leash, when you turn the temperature down on the stove, when you set into motion the tiny, subtle changes in your body... 

04:33:00
[sil.] 

04:33:00
BRENT GEARY ...that's the activation that comes from realization, insight, intuition. However it is that you'd like to think about it. And then, you're in a process, because motion implies process. Motion is governable, you can speed up and slow down. You can change direction. You can change altitude. You can change destination. You can change all sorts of things with motion, emotion, mo-, motion... 

04:34:00
[sil.] 

04:34:00
BRENT GEARY ...if you set your mind to it. If you set your body to it. And if the two were cooperating together, you can double your pleasure and double your fun, and double the control that you have in what it is that's important to you. Now, I know, that two squared, is four. And four squared, is sixteen. The Four Corners are Colorado, and New Mexico, and Arizona, and Utah. Arizona borders on California. And control squared, is very, very powerful; you may not even be able to quantify it, but you can feel it. 

04:35:05
[sil.] 

04:35:05
BRENT GEARY You can feel it. 

04:35:10
[sil.] 

04:35:10
BRENT GEARY You can feel it, and despite any kind of distractions, despite anything that comes into your mind that might distract you, despite anything that comes into your senses that might distract you, notice that focus. Now, that's part of the control. Now, any exercise, that control. 

04:35:50
[sil.] 

04:35:50
BRENT GEARY That's the motion that allows you to move toward what it is that you want. That allows you to take the rudder of your life... 

04:36:10
[sil.] 

04:36:10
BRENT GEARY ...so that you can see that destination. I know sometimes, when you look out at the Great Lakes, they're such large bodies of water, and they're all those climactic sorts of things that happen that, maybe a long time ago, when I took Geometry, Geography, Geography, and Climatology, I would have been able to explain. But now, when the fog rolls in, I don't even know the process by which it happens. But the fog's there, and sometimes, it's hard to see, but you know there's a great deal of traffic on the Great Lakes. The ships that are carrying and transporting, that are in motion and taking things here and taking things there. And even when there is a fog, there are ways for ships to continue to move. They know where they are, they know where they're going, they know where each other is, mmmpff, mmmpff. So, even with that fog there, you can avoid running into anything that gets in your way, and you can keep that motion going forward. Now, on the Great Lakes, the fog changes in a different way than it does in California. You might remember, that in California, the phrase is, "The fog is gonna burn off." Sometimes, it's there until 11:00; sometimes, it's there until 12:00; sometimes, it's there until 12:22, and then it burns off, and the sun comes back through. 

04:38:40
[sil.] 

04:38:40
BREANT GEARY At the Great Lakes, it might be the wind, it might be something else, but there's always something to clear the fog, so you can see clearly again. 

04:39:00
[sil.] 

04:39:00
BRENT GEARY How you can keep that motion, how you can keep that direction, how you can keep that destination clearly in mind, clearly in focus. 

04:39:20
[sil.] 

04:39:25
BRENT GEARY So maybe, it was two days ago, maybe it was three days ago, that, that idea, that hunch, that intuition, that was gnawing at the back of your mind, came into your awareness, came into your consciousness, and things are moving now. Or maybe, it's still there. Maybe, this idea that you had is like the tip of an iceberg, and there's more and more for you to discover. 

04:40:10
[sil.] 

04:40:10
BRENT GEARY Now, I don't know whether or not you've ever been at a swimming pool? Maybe, in someone's backyard? Maybe, at a hotel? There are all sorts of people around the pool, and there's a lot of noise, that the people are making. They're having fun. There are children. People are talking. And what happens when you are in the pool, you just go down, below the water. Everything's different. All the distraction, all the noise... 

04:40:50
[sil.] 

04:40:50
BRENT GEARY ...all that extraneous activity's gone. It's like, you're just there, all by yourself, but you know you can go back up at any time, see the sun, see the colors. And you can also go back down, anytime. 

04:41:20
[sil.] 

04:41:20
BRENT GEARY I-, you can emerge, and things can emerge within you. And the unconscious mind has this tremendous capacity - you know - to allow things to emerge that can help you the most. 

04:41:45
[sil.] 

04:41:45
BRENT GEARY Now, you can exercise that different kind of control. And you can let it come a little bit at a time, or you can let it come quickly, and you can let it come gradually, and you can savor it, and you can identify it, and you can utilize it in your own particular way. Now, there's nobody else in the world, not a living soul, who knows exactly how you're gonna do that, other than you. But you do, you do, and you will. 

04:43:05
[sil.] 

04:43:05
BRENT GEARY Now, sometimes, when, a dog is gnawing at a bone, and there's another dog around, and the other dog comes over to see what's happening with all the gnawing, there can be a little bit of tension in the air, so to speak. Maybe a growl, maybe a malevolent look, a scance, baring teeth, but when the other dog goes away, it's right back to that gnawing. People often think that cats are the most focused animals in the animal kingdom, and, certainly, they have a tremendous capacity, but a dog can be pretty focused, too. And so, you have daily reminders at a variety of levels. Within you, outside of you. In your past, in your present. In your mind, in your body. On the right side, on the left side, on the front, on the back. 

04:44:40
[sil.] 

04:44:40
BRENT GEARY Of all the different possibilities and all the different methods and means of control, that are available to you. And so, it's just choosing how it is... 

04:45:00
[sil.] 

04:45:00
BRENT GEARY ...that you enable and allow yourself to utilize that control for your benefit. So, take just about a minute of clock time, a pretty short period of time, but it's all the time in the world that you need to allow this experience to integrate in the privacy of your own thoughts, and emotions, and sensations there. Just take about a minute to do whatever it is that you like to do, and at the end of that moment, I'll start talking to you again. 

04:45:50
[sil.] 

04:46:15
BRENT GEARY Not quite yet. Just keep yourself nice and calm, cuz it takes just a little bit of time to reorient, so, feel the energy flowing back into your body. You're probably really good at this, already. You can count how many people out there are coughing. As your awareness starts to return, you reaches back into the environment. You remember where you are, what day it is, approximately what time of day. That's right, motions occur, and when you're ready, take one, or two, or three nice, easy breaths. Allow your eyes to open, and come back feeling refreshed, awake, alert. Ready to enjoy the rest of this day and those that are coming. 

04:47:15
[sil.] 

04:47:25
BRENT GEARY Welcome back. Off the top of your head, how long would you say that was? 

04:47:30
[sil.] 

04:47:30
KIM I have no idea. I, I don't know. 

04:47:35
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

04:47:35
KIM It felt like a long time. 

04:47:35
BRENT GEARY Remember when you said it was the sensation your stomach was a 7 before? About where would it be, now? 

04:47:50
[sil.] 

04:47:50
KIM I don't notice it different from the rest of my body. So, I would say, like, it feels integrated. It doesn't feel any different than the rest of my, it feels relaxed. 

04:48:00
BRENT GEARY So, like, at a 1 or a 2? 

04:48:00
KIM Yeah, I'm gonna go to a 1. 

04:48:05
BRENT GEARY A 1? Okay. 

04:48:05
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:48:05
BRENT GEARY So you did better than a 5? 

04:48:05
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:48:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. You feel like you're, you're back? 

04:48:10
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:48:10
BRENT GEARY Okay. Do you remember what day it is? 

04:48:15
KIM Yes, I think so. 

04:48:15
BRENT GEARY Do you remember who the president was before Obama? 

04:48:20
KIM I don't know. I'm just kidding. Yes, of course, I know. I think they all suck. Sorry. 

04:48:25
BRENT GEARY You can say that again. Anything, now, if there's anything about your experience you'd like to talk about, I welcome you to do that. If there's anything you want to keep private, to yourself, please, please do that. 

04:48:35
KIM It felt okay. Um, what, the thought that was in the back of my head, when you were talking was, 'There's a lot that I want to do,' and, that, that was okay. 

04:48:50
BRENT GEARY Mmm-hmm 

04:48:50
KIM And that, to keep doing it. 

04:48:50
BRENT GEARY Okay. 

04:48:50
KIM Um, and that it wasn't bad that I wanted to accomplish so much or do so much. 

04:49:00
BRENT GEARY Absolutely not. 

04:49:05
KIM I just said that it felt okay that I wanna do so much. You know, like, I, I have a lot of friends who say, "Why do you do so much? You're always doing so much. Go, go, go, go, go." And the feeling was, it felt like it was, "No, this was okay." This was what my journey is. 

04:49:20
BRENT GEARY Okay. How do you do that and take care of your stomach? 

04:49:25
[sil.] 

04:49:25
KIM By continuing to do the things that I do, but, I th-, it... 

04:49:35
[sil.] 

04:49:35
KIM ...by knowing it's, I don't know. I don't know, that's a good question. 

04:49:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. You don't have to answer it right now. 

04:49:40
KIM Yeah. I don't know. 

04:49:45
BRENT GEARY It'd be a good one to think about, though, I think. 

04:49:45
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:49:45
BRENT GEARY Um, if they have any questions for you about your experience, is it okay... 

04:49:50
KIM Sure 

04:49:50
BRENT GEARY ...for them to ask them? If you'd like to ask a question, please go to the microphone, there. 

04:49:55
[sil.] 

04:50:05
UNKNOWN Hi. I noticed that Dr. Geary so skillfully, I'm just really jealous, used all these, um, great words that I think reflected a lot of your experience that you had told us about. Words, like, exercise... 

04:50:20
KIM Mmm-hmm 

04:50:20
UNKNOWN ...and about the dogs, and it was just so rich with your experience, that you had told us about, so, I was wondering if, from your perspective, that, in fact, make a difference in your experience, as the recipient? 

04:50:35
KIM Huge, huge. Everything that he was saying, I could see myself doing things, and then when you talked about swimming, um, since I was a kid, I'd love to be a fish, hence, the dolphin tattoo. And so, when you said to go down, my body s-, just, like, sank. I felt like my body was drifting away from my head, and, it, um, it made it more vivid in my mind. I could see myself doing some of these things. I could see myself breathing, and, um, moving. And, funny enough, in this one yoga pose that I hate, I saw myself loving it and doing it with ease, as well. And it's a twisted one, where it, it, kind of, squeezes your internal organs, and, um, it's one that I always go, "Ugh," and I was loving it, and my body just opened up. It just really opened up. 

04:51:30
BRENT GEARY Wow. 

04:51:30
KIM Mmm-hmm, yeah. So. 

04:51:35
BRENT GEARY Okay. If anybody has any questions for me, fire away - no accusations. I get enough of those. If anything occurs to you that you'd like to add, please, please feel free to, to talk more. 

04:51:55
UNKNOWN Um, you, before the session started, um, it seemed like gnawing and control were, kind of, negative, but, you seemed to put a positive spin on it, was that your intention? 

04:52:05
KIM No, not at all. I thought I really wanted to let go of control, and I don't remember, exactly, what Brent was saying, but, it was like it was okay, it was, because that's what's also gotten me to accomplish a lot of things, you know, has been this sense of juggling all these se-, it felt good. It felt like it was okay. And what felt, what was coming at me was, very clearly, was, that, according to other people, it's not okay to be so in control, that's it's okay for me to do it the way I want to do it. 

04:52:40
BRENT GEARY You know, everything contains its opposite, and there are good aspects of control, and there are bad aspects of control, and if you, um, I mean, you can't go into hypnosis without exercising control. And you can't, um, carry out life without exercising control, and there are lots of good aspects of control, and, so, um, I don't know that I particularly like the characterization of it as 'spin,' because that brings up certain associations with the political field, but, um, but yeah, I, um, just wanted to, to 'spin,' or to, to add, you know, it's like, uh, it's, it's like the sun shining down, and you're focusing on the, on this aspect of control, and, If you just recede the shadow a little bit, there are lots of good aspects of control, too. And, I think that, a lot of what Kim is talking about, in terms of what she wanted, very much involves a proper and self-generative exercise of control. So, I just wanted some consideration of that side of the coin, so to speak. 

04:53:45
KIM When you were talking about the motion, I felt like I was sitting here, rocking, like, my whole, not a gentle rock, like, my whole body was going with this rhythmic, really strong wave, too. 

04:53:55
BRENT GEARY Wow. Wow. 

04:53:55
KIM Yeah, I was ver-, very deep. 

04:54:00
BRENT GEARY Mmm-hmm 

04:54:00
KIM Yeah. No drugs involved too. 

04:54:05
[sil.] 

04:54:05
UNKNOWN Um, yes. I had a question for Dr. Geary. Um, I always allow myself to experience the, uh, the trance, while the, while the person is, is talking. Um, in this particular case, I, you know, I was just so impressed, I think that is what the other person said, as well, with, um, your use of language, your flowing in and out of language, in and out of different imagery. Uh, bringing back, constantly, you know, certain elements. And, I'm just wondering if this comes completely naturally from you? You know, what parts of 'You' are you using to weave together this beautiful, sort of, set of images, using the words that you do? It's... 

04:54:45
BRENT GEARY Well, I was born this way, so no one else can do it. So, sorry. 

04:54:50
UNKNOWN That's a good answer, yeah. 

04:54:55
BRENT GEARY It comes from a lot, a lot, a lot of different places. Um, my first teacher was Steve Gilligan, and, there's been no person more masterful at this, than I've witnessed in my life, than Steve Gilligan. And so, way back, when I started taking workshops from him, in 1980, um, I wanted to, in some ways, emulate and learn from him; and I think I learned some of the method from, from Steve. Um, I worked as a bartender, my way through, um, my undergraduate days, and there was a fellow bartender and I, what we thought we'd do is we'd start on something and tell puns, back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth, until we couldn't think of anymore puns. It gets you thinking this way, and, um, I've always liked plays on words, Erickson loved plays on words. There are examples where Gregory Bateson and Erickson would send letters to each other with plays on words in them. So, always, I've thought that my task, as someone who conducted hypnosis, is to stimulate associations, generate associations. And, if you do eight things, you'll generate a certain number of associations. If you do 68 things, you'll generate more associations, and so, I tell them to fill sessions, a lot, and I use a lot of free-association, but I also give people a moment of silence, because, I had a patient tell me, once, that I talk too much. And, I immediately effected a referral to another therapist, cuz, I was so offended, but it taught me a lesson, and so, I said, "Okay, well, I need to do something," and so, I put in a moment of silence. Did you, was that welcome to you, to have a moment? 

04:56:35
KIM Yeah, it was. 

04:56:35
BRENT GEARY Okay 

04:56:35
BRENT GEARY It was good. 

04:56:35
BRENT GEARY So 

04:56:35
KIM I don't think you talk too much, just so you know. 

04:56:40
BRENT GEARY Okay. So, it's just, using, you know, once, once you start practicing hypnosis, and you're not thinking about truisms and implied causes and all of these things anymore; get into your own associations, because, your associations are, are what create the hypnotic session, and their associations are what create the change and create the progress. 

04:57:00
UNKNOWN Uh, Dr. Geary, I was listening for the BASK and the MORE, and I'm sure they, the observation was important, but if you would review any of the words that you used that might relate to that, that would be helpful. 

04:57:15
BRENT GEARY I would have to look at the video. 

04:57:15
UNKNOWN Okay 

04:57:15
BRENT GEARY I mean, I know s-, you know, lots of things were di-, going beneath the pool was dissociative. The fog was dissociative. Um, the dog being in the other room before the separate gnawing was dissociative. Something in the back of your mind is dissociative. Uh, a distraction being out there and then, floating through your mind and then leaving, that's dissociative. I talked about right and left, up and down, front and back, that's dissociative. Any other? Four Corners. 

04:57:45
KIM That, yeah. 

04:57:45
BRENT GEARY Yeah, that... 

04:57:45
KIM Pretty much, got me confused. 

04:57:50
BRENT GEARY Pardon me? 

04:57:50
UNKNOWN Geometry and Geography 

04:57:50
BRENT GEARY Geometry, that was, that was misspeak. Motion and emotion? 

04:58:00
BRENT GEARY I was gonna say, never mind, I was gonna tell you what I was going to say. Um, so, some of those are the dissociative things - I don't remember who asked the question - but, but I was, I could go back and rev-, review the video, and say this was dissociative, this was dissociative, this. I, imagine there were about 35 things, I hope. 

04:58:20
[sil.] 

04:58:20
UNKNOWN Oh. Yes, Dr. Geary, I wonder, you had asked, early on, what she wanted to experience or accomplish in this particular session. So, I wondered if you're seeing somebody on an ongoing basis, do you make a point of that in each session? 

04:58:35
BRENT GEARY Yes 

04:58:35
UNKNOWN You do? 

04:58:35
BRENT GEARY I want to, I want to know, before the person leaves my office, if we accomplished something, that's leading toward the larger goal. 

04:58:40
UNKNOWN But, you start the session, or, early on in the session, you would ask an ongoing client what they wanted to get... 

04:58:45
BRENT GEARY Yes 

04:58:45
UNKNOWN ...from that particular session? 

04:58:45
BRENT GEARY Or, I mean, it's not the first, it's not the first thing that I say... 

04:58:50
UNKNOWN No, no, no 

04:58:50
BRENT GEARY ...when they walk in, but before I start the hypnosis, yes. 

04:58:50
UNKNOWN Okay 

04:58:55
BRENT GEARY And, and, sometimes, I have a goal in my own mind, because, you have some kind of... 

04:58:55
UNKNOWN That's what I wondered. 

04:58:55
BRENT GEARY ...you know, obsessional people, vigilant people, and they're gonna watch for everything word-for-word, if that's matching the goal or not. Um, so, sometimes, in my own mind, sometimes, just like this, I say, "What would you like to accomplish in this time?" And, you know, patients don't go to setting good goals for therapy workshops, so we usually have to help 'em get it into something. They talk about things they want to accomplish out there, and we need to have something to accomplish, here, before the person leaves. So, we had, here, a 7, came down to 1. 

04:59:25
UNKNOWN Right 

04:59:25
BRENT GEARY Bingo! 

04:59:25
UNKNOWN Good, thank you. 

04:59:30
[sil.] 

04:59:30
UNKNOWN Dr. Geary, um, now, this would not be a client that you identify as a dissociative client, is it? 

04:59:40
BRENT GEARY No 

04:59:40
UNKNOWN Okay. So... 

04:59:40
BRENT GEARY No more than, no more than anyone else. 

04:59:40
UNKNOWN Right. So, w-, would you speak to how dissociation helps, uh, them get into a hypnotic trance? 

04:59:50
BRENT GEARY You have three hours? Go to my workshop tomorrow, and I'll answer all your questions. You can't do hypnosis without dissociation. You simply can't. Um, you know the hypnotic phenomena, age regression and catalytic? All those depend upon dissociation. So, dissociaton is the essence of hypnosis. You can do hypnosis without an induction. You can do hypnosis without a goal. You can do hypnosis without words, even, but you can't disso-, you can't do hypnosis without dissociation, so, they're, like, um, love and marriage, horse and carriage. No, hypnosis and dissociation are inseparable. 

05:00:35
UNKNOWN So, this is, probably, a very basic question, but, what is the difference between trance and dissociation? 

05:00:45
BRENT GEARY Trance is the utilization of dissociation. Dissociation comes first. 

05:00:50
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. Thank you. 

05:00:55
BRENT GEARY How was that? She almost threw me. That would have been rather embarrassing. 

05:01:00
UNKNOWN I've had an opportunity to read some of Erickson's stuff, and what I think it interesting, as opposed to other forms of therapy, is what you've just done here on stage, which was: you asked a few questions, "What about this? What about that? What about this? Okay, let's get started." Right? What are you looking for, before you start something? 

05:01:20
BRENT GEARY A goal. Once I've got the goal... 

05:01:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Can I find out a little bit more? 

05:01:25
BRENT GEARY Once I've got the goal, I'm ready to go. Um, now, we're not doing psychotherapy, here. I talked to her, very briefly, over here, and just, basically, to keep things secret to herself in the initial interview. I would've talked to her longer. Um, I would've talked to her, maybe, three more minutes. That's a joke. Uh, maybe ten more minutes. I probably would've talked to her about ten more minutes, and then, I would've been ready to go. This is the way I learned to do therapy. I don't know how to do long term therapy. When a person comes into my office, and it, they're in the midst of existential angst, I feel like jumping out the window. I don't know how to do long term therapy. Um, and this is how I do it, and people have blasted me, criticized me, told me how inept, told me how surface, told me how incomplete my therapy is, through the years, but this is all I know how to do, and I get pretty good results with my patients, so I tell all of them to, gnaw off. So, I would've talked to her for another ten minutes, but, literally, th-, th-, the real answer to your question is, when I have a goal, we're ready to go. And then, she's gonna come back, and we're gonna do other things, and, you know, it's, it's usually not that you just have one shot with a person. So, each session, as I said in the fundamental the other day, it's just repetitious for those of you who were there. Each session's a link in the chain. But there is something, here, that the chain is leading toward, and then the person says, "You know, I think I feel better. I think what I came to see you is resolved. Arrivederci. Sayonara. Adios. 

05:03:10
[sil.] 

05:03:10
BRENT GEARY Aufedersein. Adieu. 

05:03:15
[sil.] 

05:03:15
KIM Bon Voyage. 

05:03:15
BRENT GEARY Bon voyage. Ciao. And on that, we'll have one more question. 

05:03:25
UNKNOWN Like the subject, I have a California-Illinois connection; I'm in Illinois now. Uh, this question to the subject, um, when Dr. Geary, um, mentioned 'the Terrible T's,' did that have any particular meaning to you? I was quite bemused by it, myself. I, did, did, that, uh... 

05:03:35
KIM No, it made me laugh. My dog Trouble, he's a little Bichon, and he constantly runs away and takes off, and, uh, he's, he's trouble. 

05:03:45
[sil.] 

05:03:45
UNKNOWN Okay 

05:03:45
KIM So, it just made me laugh. 

05:03:45
UNKNOWN Okay. I was, I was thinking of a much... 

05:03:45
KIM When you said 'the Terrible T's,' they are. 

05:03:45
UNKNOWN ...I was thinking of a much deeper thing... 

05:03:50
KIM Mmm-mmm 

05:03:50
UNKNOWN ...so I'm not going to say anything. 

05:03:50
KIM No, no. Not at all. 

05:03:55
BRENT GEARY No. Okay, thank you all for coming, and please enjoy the rest of the Congress. Thank you. 

05:04:00
Betty Alice Erickson, MS. LPC, LMFT 

05:04:00
LANA Okay. 

05:04:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Now, if you keep backing up, I'll keep moving forward. 

05:04:10
LANA Oh yeah? 

05:04:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay? 

05:04:10
LANA Okay. 

05:04:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, as you know, my name is Betty Alice. 

05:04:15
LANA Yes, I do. 

05:04:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yes. So... 

05:04:20
LANA Thank you for letting me come up here. 

05:04:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Well, you're quite welcome. Thank you for coming up here. So what... 

05:04:25
LANA I welcome that. 

05:04:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay? Okay. Now, what is it, in a perfect world, that you could tell me, that we could change in this hour? 

05:04:50
LANA Well, I think that there's some fear holding me back from... 

05:04:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Is it... 

05:04:55
LANA ...making a change. 

05:04:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Is it the fear of the tiger? Or, is it... 

05:05:00
LANA Not loud enough? 

05:05:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Who's not? Me's not enough? Me's not enough. 

05:05:05
UNKNOWN Both. 

05:05:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, both of us. So, can the sound man turn our sound up a little bit, too? So we don't... 

05:05:15
LANA He's saying, he's raising his hand. 

05:05:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, uh... 

05:05:15
LANA Okay, we'll try to talk louder. 

05:05:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. Let's start all over again. Hi... 

05:05:20
LANA Hi 

05:05:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...in a perfect world, what is it that you would like in this hour? 

05:05:25
LANA I would like, um, to feel a little bit less fear about making a big change in my life. 

05:05:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Is this fear, as Erickson used to describe the two kinds of fear, the fear of the tiger, or fear from here? 

05:05:50
LANA Fear from here. 

05:05:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Fear. Boy, that's really powerful, though, huh? 

05:05:55
LANA Yeah. It feels like a tiger. 

05:05:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I've never heard anybody say that, and I love it! I know exactly what you mean. So, tell me a little bit more. 

05:06:05
LANA Okay, well, I'm, um, a child psychiatrist by training... 

05:06:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm 

05:06:10
LANA ...and I moved from Canada to California... 

05:06:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm 

05:06:20
LANA ...um, about two and a half years ago. 

05:06:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm 

05:06:20
LANA And I work at a university there, in their psychiatry department, and, um, I've come to the realization that it's probably not the best place for me. Um, one, because they want me to work full time, and I have two little kids and don't wanna work full time. And, two, because, um, I am much more interested in doing a lot of therapy than just medication And there, they, there's a lot of pressure just to do the latter; to be more of a prescriber, only. 

05:07:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Can a man get amount with... 

05:07:00
LANA Yeah, with med management, basically, yeah. So, I'm starting to think about, but I love teaching, so, that's why I'm at this university, but, I'm starting to think that a private practice, with, maybe, some things added in, like, volunteer faculty, or something, may be better for me, but I'm anxious about it because I don't really know the American system very well. I don't know how I'm gonna get patients. Um... 

05:07:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON If you don't know the American system very well. 

05:07:35
LANA No 

05:07:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Where are you from? 

05:07:40
LANA Canada 

05:07:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, okay Canada. 

05:07:40
LANA Yeah 

05:07:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay 

05:07:45
LANA Yeah. So, I'd, kind of, have to figure out all these things, and it's, there, it's very easy, I just show up and they have patients booked for me. So, um, so, it's more complicated, but ultimately, I think, will be more rewarding, but I'm, yeah. 

05:08:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you, often, this is a genuine question... 

05:08:10
LANA Okay 

05:08:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...cuz sometimes, I ask questions that I'm pretty sure the answer to... 

05:08:15
LANA Uh-huh 

05:08:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and this is a question for information... 

05:08:20
LANA Okay 

05:08:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you, do you like the easy way, or do you like a challenge? 

05:08:25
LANA Typically, a challenge. 

05:08:30
[sil.] 

05:08:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I would imagine, upon re-, upon reflection, because, you've got a pretty good, pretty lengthy education. 

05:08:40
LANA Mmm-hmm. I worked as a, in investment banking, before I went back to medical school, so. 

05:08:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, it's even, your second or your third choice of doing a living. 

05:09:00
LANA Mmm-hmm, yeah. So, I, yeah. I had to do a lot of things to switch paths to this, here, yeah. 

05:09:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So you like a challenge? 

05:09:10
LANA Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, I think I have mixed feelings about challenges, but... 

05:09:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, no, no, no. I know that, but if you had to make it, just for my... 

05:09:20
LANA Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah. Yeah. 

05:09:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Isn't that amazing? I think, I don't know, and I like a lot of stuff that isn't proven, because it just fits handy in my head. I think that there is a challenge gene. 

05:09:45
LANA Mmm 

05:09:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That we either have or we don't have. And if we got that ol' challenge gene, we not only like challenges, we almost look for them. 

05:10:00
LANA Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I might have that gene. 

05:10:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's, kind of, a nice gene, but it's like everything else, paradoxical. 

05:10:10
LANA Yeah. It does make things more complicated, sometimes. 

05:10:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Makes things harder. 

05:10:15
LANA Yeah 

05:10:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, there's no 'sometimes' about it. 

05:10:20
LANA Okay, yes, it is. 

05:10:25
[sil.] 

05:10:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Would you trade that gene? 

05:10:30
[sil.] 

05:10:30
LANA No. I think, sometimes, I think, maybe, I would, but, on deeper reflection, the answer would be no. Yeah. 

05:10:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I, I tend to agree with you, that, them that has it, knows it costs, but them that ha-, has it, don't like the cost, but you pay it. 

05:11:00
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:11:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Are you a married mom... 

05:11:05
LANA Yes 

05:11:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...or a single? Okay. What input does your husband give you? 

05:11:15
[sil.] 

05:11:15
LANA About this specific issue, what I shoud do? 

05:11:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Well, yeah, that's sort of... 

05:11:25
LANA Um, he thinks, he thinks it will work out, if I leave and go to a practice. He, he doesn't think it will be a problem for me. 

05:11:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, I'm gonna... 

05:11:35
LANA He's an optimist. 

05:11:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm gonna turn my eyes away from you. Can you all hear her? 

05:11:40
UNKNOWN No 

05:11:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I didn't think so. 

05:11:45
UNKNOWN We can't hear you, either. 

05:11:45
UNKNOWN We can't hear you, either. 

05:11:45
LANA Shall we turn the sound up? 

05:11:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, my goodness! I am so sorry! I will do my absolute, dead-level best to talk very loudly, and... 

05:11:55
LANA () 

05:11:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And, please ignore me, if I'm shouting. Please ignore the shouting... 

05:12:00
LANA Okay 

05:12:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...because, when we talk, it does drop. 

05:12:05
LANA Yeah 

05:12:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, I ask, let's go back... 

05:12:05
LANA Okay 

05:12:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...about four sentences. 

05:12:10
[sil.] 

05:12:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you have, uh, a challenge gene? 

05:12:15
LANA Yes 

05:12:20
[sil.] 

05:12:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you like that challenge gene? 

05:12:25
LANA Mostly, yes. 

05:12:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Would you, would you trade that challenge gene? Would you trade that challenge gene? 

05:12:40
LANA Oh, I can take it off too. 

05:12:45
[sil.] 

05:12:45
No. 

05:12:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Even though it costs? 

05:12:50
LANA Yeah, even though it costs. Yeah. 

05:12:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I know. And your husband gives you valid information on summarizing, correct me if I'm wrong, valid information that it's, everything's gonna work out. 

05:13:10
LANA Yeah 

05:13:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But, you added, he's an optimist. 

05:13:15
LANA Yeah. Well, he always thinks everything's going to work out for me. 

05:13:20
[sil.] 

05:13:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you know where I'm going next? 

05:13:30
[sil.] 

05:13:30
LANA I have an idea. 

05:13:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm. Where do you think I'm going next? Where do you think I'm going next? 

05:13:40
LANA Well, I added that in, that he was an optimist... 

05:13:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm 

05:13:45
LANA ...so, he would think things would work out, cuz that's what he is, but that's not typically what I am. 

05:13:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I love people, because we are all exactly alike. 

05:14:05
LANA Hmm 

05:14:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because you gave me a walk-in to the very next question. And then, you, kind of, changed it a little bit, becaue you said, "My husband is an optimist, and he always thinks things are going to work out"... 

05:14:25
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:14:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ..."for me." 

05:14:25
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:14:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do they generally work out, 'for you'? 

05:14:35
[sil.] 

05:14:35
LANA Yes, but they... 

05:14:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's okay... 

05:14:35
LANA ...but they seem to... 

05:14:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...it's okay. 

05:14:35
LANA ...but they seem to require, potentially unnecessary, suffering. 

05:14:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, maybe, that's what we're really talking about. 

05:14:55
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:14:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON The suffering, the stirring around, this discombobulation... 

05:15:05
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:15:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...of making a decision... 

05:15:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:15:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...that on one level, maybe. You're already pretty sure where you're gonna go. 

05:15:20
[sil.] 

05:15:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You think? 

05:15:45
LANA Yeah. Yeah. That I, sort of, am feeling less unsure than I think about where I'm gonna go, yeah. 

05:16:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, I like the phrase, because, see, that's what I wanna just pick up... 

05:16:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:16:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...your betweenness. 

05:16:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:16:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But it causes a lot of unnecessary suffering. 

05:16:15
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:16:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And that's another reason I love people... 

05:16:25
[sil.] 

05:16:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...because that's such a normal, human place to be. 

05:16:35
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:16:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Cuz I think the decision is pretty much made. 

05:16:40
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:16:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I'm not a big ol' believer in secondary gains. I'm really, sometimes, it's clear, but I don't think you're a big ol' secondary gain kinda person. 

05:17:00
LANA What do you mean? 

05:17:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON "I have to suffer, have to suffer, have to suffer, in order... Cuz suffering feels good on one level, so that I can make the next step. 

05:17:10
LANA No. They could... 

05:17:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You're not? 

05:17:10
LANA I agree with you. I think I was raised that way, but, I don't agree with it. 

05:17:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, you were raised sorta like that? 

05:17:20
LANA Yeah. That life is suffering. 

05:17:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I think... 

05:17:30
[sil.] 

05:17:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...cuz you're, you know who the expert on you is... 

05:17:35
[sil.] 

05:17:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...but I think, that sometimes, what we do... 

05:17:45
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:17:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...is we fall back... 

05:17:50
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:17:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...on old, familiar places... 

05:17:55
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:17:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...but it's different than secondary gain. 

05:18:00
LANA Yeah 

05:18:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. I, I... 

05:18:00
LANA Yeah 

05:18:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's that, we, sort of, don't know how to do it any other way. 

05:18:15
LANA Mmm-hmm. Well, I want to do it another way. 

05:18:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I know that, I know that, but it's that, our history has only given us... 

05:18:25
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:18:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...one way to handle it... 

05:18:30
LANA Yeah 

05:18:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and we don't quite know how to forge a new pathway. 

05:18:40
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:18:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON How old are your kids? 

05:18:40
LANA Almost 5 and 2 1/2. 

05:18:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh, darling, little bitty ones. 

05:18:45
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:18:50
[sil.] 

05:18:50
LANA Yeah, they bring me a lot of joy. 

05:18:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yes. And... 

05:19:00
LANA Some heartache too. 

05:19:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Heartache? What do you mean? 

05:19:10
[sil.] 

05:19:10
LANA Well, um... 

05:19:15
[sil.] 

05:19:15
LANA I mean, it's not always easy being with young children. 

05:19:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Of course not. 

05:19:20
LANA Um, one of those, very, very strong willed. 

05:19:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Aren't you lucky? Because, if you can channel that... 

05:19:35
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:19:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...you've got a winner. 

05:19:35
LANA Mmm-hmm. Yeah. 

05:19:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And, maybe, heartache, maybe, I misunderstood the meaning you intended. 

05:19:50
LANA Hmm, maybe. What did you think, when I said heartache? 

05:19:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I thought heartache of despair, instead of... 

05:20:00
LANA Oh, no, no, no. 

05:20:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...instead of annoyance. 

05:20:05
LANA Yeah, more annoyance than... 

05:20:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah, oh my gosh. 

05:20:10
LANA Not that again, yeah. 

05:20:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Cuz my thought is that you love your children. 

05:20:20
LANA Oh, yeah. Very, very deeply. 

05:20:25
[sil.] 

05:20:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I always used to ask my father things I didn't understand. 

05:20:35
[sil.] 

05:20:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And once, I was talking to my best girlfriend, who had a baby the same age as my baby, my first baby, and we're looking at it, admiring our wonderful children, and admiring how much we loved them and couldn't figure out where that amount of love came... 

05:21:00
LANA Mmm 

05:21:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Uh-huh 

05:21:00
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:21:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Right 

05:21:00
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:21:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I said to my girlfriend, "I can't believe this, I'd s-, jump in front, leap in front of a train, if I thought it'd give him a happy life." 

05:21:10
LANA Mmm 

05:21:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And my girlfriend said, "I think I would, too." 

05:21:15
LANA Mmm 

05:21:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I clicked it in my head, and the next time that I saw Daddy, I told him that identical story, and I said, "What am I missing?" and Daddy said, "No, she wouldn't. Some things, you don't make a decision about, you just do." I think you'd leap in front of a train to give your child a happy life. 

05:21:45
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:21:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Cuz that was the sense of love I picked up from you. 

05:21:50
LANA Mmm, yeah. 

05:21:55
[sil.] 

05:21:55
LANA Yeah. That love that's just bursting... 

05:22:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Right 

05:22:00
LANA ...out of me. Yeah. 

05:22:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What do you wanna teach 'em? 

05:22:10
[sil.] 

05:22:10
LANA To be at ease in the world. 

05:22:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oohh, excellent, Lana, excellent. "To be at ease," that's a wonderful answer. You know that. 

05:22:30
[sil.] 

05:22:30
LANA I had to think about that a lot. 

05:22:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You think about it a lot? 

05:22:35
LANA Mmm-hmm. How to do that. 

05:22:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON How to do that? 

05:22:40
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:22:45
[sil.] 

05:22:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What do you want to teach them, wait, let me back up. How, what is being at ease in the world, in their world? 

05:23:00
[sil.] 

05:23:00
LANA It's being able to handle whatever comes at them. Be open. 

05:23:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You see why I love people? 

05:23:20
[sil.] 

05:23:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you know what you just told me? 

05:23:30
[sil.] 

05:23:30
LANA I told you what I wanted for myself. 

05:23:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And if you want it for your children, then what? 

05:23:50
LANA Then, I will have it for myself... 

05:24:00
[sil.] 

05:24:00
LANA ...because that's the best way for them to have it. 

05:24:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I don't think it's the best way. 

05:24:05
LANA The only way. 

05:24:10
[sil.] 

05:24:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's just hard. 

05:24:20
LANA Yeah 

05:24:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because it's as though there's a pathway, okay, just a minute, okay? Can you hear me? Okay. It's as though there's a pathway. 

05:24:35
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:24:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And there's one pathway, that, boy, you know where rocks are... 

05:24:40
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:24:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and you know it's gonna lead... 

05:24:45
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:24:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...where you want it to lead, but there's rocks in it... 

05:24:50
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:24:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and muddy spots... 

05:24:50
LANA Yeah, I know. 

05:24:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and you know that you can navigate it. 

05:24:55
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:25:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And then, there's another path... 

05:25:00
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:25:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...that also leads to the same destination, and that, you don't know what's on that path. 

05:25:15
LANA Mmm-mmm 

05:25:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Remember in the workshop that you were with, cuz you were with me, in an earlier workshop, right? 

05:25:25
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Yeah. 

05:25:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And do you remember that I said that my father is often not quoted completely correctly? 

05:25:45
[sil.] 

05:25:45
LANA I don't quite remember. Uh, I remember something like that, yeah. 

05:25:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And I said, that, a lot of times, he is quoted, "Trust your unconscious." 

05:26:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:26:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But, do you remember what I said I believed the real quotation is? 

05:26:10
LANA No 

05:26:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON "Trust the unconscious." 

05:26:15
LANA Hmm 

05:26:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Your unconscious, my unconscious. My unconscious, your unconscious. 

05:26:30
[sil.] 

05:26:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And it's scary and hard, to trust your unconscious, let alone my unconscious... 

05:26:40
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:26:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...unless, you have been fortunate enough to have a lot of practice. 

05:26:55
[sil.] 

05:27:10
LANA I want more practice. 

05:27:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm sorry? 

05:27:10
LANA I'd like more practice. 

05:27:20
[sil.] 

05:27:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON How can I give you more practice right now, in this experience? 

05:27:30
[sil.] 

05:27:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I can give you a lucky charm? A flashlight? You know how little kids have their lucky charm in their pocket? 

05:27:55
LANA Uh-huh 

05:28:00
[sil.] 

05:28:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But that lucky charm doesn't do this, it's not gonna change anything. 

05:28:10
[sil.] 

05:28:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's just feeling better. 

05:28:10
LANA Yeah, I'd like to feel more connected to that. 

05:28:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Feel more connected? 

05:28:20
LANA Connected to the unconscious, to, what lies beneath. 

05:28:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I, I don't understand what you're, say it again? 

05:28:30
LANA I'd like to feel more connected, to my unconscious. 

05:28:35
[sil.] 

05:28:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you know that you've been in a trance many times in this demonstration? 

05:28:50
LANA I thought so. I thought so. 

05:28:55
[sil.] 

05:28:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON When you go inside in a trance... 

05:29:00
[sil.] 

05:29:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...what do you feel? 

05:29:05
[sil.] 

05:29:05
LANA A sense of calm. 

05:29:10
[sil.] 

05:29:10
LANA A, uh, warmth. 

05:29:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What do you feel from me? 

05:29:15
LANA Warmth. Love. Caring. 

05:29:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Faith? Trust? 

05:29:25
LANA Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I would say I trust you, completely. 

05:29:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Can you take that from me... 

05:29:40
[sil.] 

05:29:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and put it inside you? 

05:29:45
LANA Mmm-hmm. Yeah. 

05:29:50
[sil.] 

05:29:50
LANA I can. 

05:29:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Isn't it amazing? Because we're not doing anything, but we are doing a lot. 

05:30:05
LANA Mmm. Yeah, we are doing a lot. 

05:30:15
[sil.] 

05:30:15
LANA I feel like, just looking in your eyes, I'm getting a lot. 

05:30:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON We're really connected right now. 

05:30:30
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:30:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And when we're connected, what I think is, you can take what I offer, in a way that is useful to you... 

05:30:50
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:30:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...cuz that other pathway... 

05:30:55
LANA Mmm 

05:30:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...without the mud, without the cactus stickers, without the big ol' rocks in it... 

05:31:00
LANA Mmm 

05:31:05
[sil.] 

05:31:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...that's a lot of effort to get to the same goal. 

05:31:15
LANA Mmm 

05:31:20
[sil.] 

05:31:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON When my brother was a little boy... 

05:31:25
[sil.] 

05:31:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...he went through a stage, when he was about 3 or 4... 

05:31:30
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:31:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...where he was, sort of, afraid to walk, without hanging onto a wall... 

05:31:35
LANA Mmm 

05:31:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...but, you know kids. 

05:31:40
LANA Mmm-hmm. They like to regress. 

05:31:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm sorry, what? 

05:31:45
LANA They like to regress, at times. 

05:31:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And, you know, you can't really get places if you gotta hold onto a wall or a chair. 

05:31:55
[sil.] 

05:31:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And Daddy took a newspaper, and he rolled it up, tightly,... 

05:32:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:32:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...nice and firm. And he gave it to Alan, my brother. 

05:32:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:32:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And then, a little while later, he took a sheet from the newspaper, and then, another sheet from the newspaper. 

05:32:25
LANA Mmm 

05:32:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And then, another sheet from the newspaper, and Alan says he remembers that the other people in the room were chuckling. But, he looked at Daddy, and Daddy looked at him, and he knew he was right and Dad was right. 

05:33:00
[sil.] 

05:33:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay? 

05:33:00
LANA Mmm-hmm. I think I got it. 

05:33:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Hmm? 

05:33:30
LANA I think I got what you said. 

05:33:35
[sil.] 

05:33:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm going to take my eyes from you and look at my watch. If you're in my office, I've got several clocks, and if I could see your watch, I could tell time upside down, but... 

05:33:50
[sil.] 

05:33:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...so... 

05:33:55
[sil.] 

05:33:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...from my volunteer, what time am I finished? 

05:34:05
[sil.] 

05:34:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON How many more minutes do I have? 

05:34:05
UNKNOWN 20 

05:34:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON 20 

05:34:10
UNKNOWN 25 

05:34:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON 25, okay. So, we're half done. Are you half done? Or are you 60 percent done, or 70 percent done, or 80 percent done, or 90 percent done, or 95 percent done? 

05:34:30
[sil.] 

05:34:30
LANA 65 percent done. 

05:34:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Not bad. 

05:34:40
[sil.] 

05:34:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Pretty good. 

05:34:40
LANA Yeah 

05:34:45
[sil.] 

05:34:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What will you do, if you'd leap in front of a train? Which, we'll believe. 

05:34:55
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:34:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You would? 

05:35:00
LANA For my kids... 

05:35:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON If your children have... 

05:35:00
LANA ...yeah, of course, of course. 

05:35:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What else will you do? To help your children, what were your words? 

05:35:10
LANA At ease? 

05:35:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON At ease, yeah. 

05:35:15
LANA In the world. 

05:35:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON At ease in the wo-, beautiful phrase, by the way. Beautiful. 

05:35:25
LANA What else? 

05:35:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because there's no train. 

05:35:30
LANA Change. 

05:35:35
[sil.] 

05:35:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you have to tell anybody you've changed? 

05:35:40
LANA No 

05:35:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely. 

05:35:45
[sil.] 

05:35:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely, including me. 

05:35:55
LANA What about myself? 

05:35:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You don't have to tell, what do you have to tell yourself? Yourself doesn't know yourself? 

05:36:05
[sil.] 

05:36:05
LANA Maybe not everything. 

05:36:15
[sil.] 

05:36:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Make a bet. 

05:36:20
[sil.] 

05:36:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I think yourself knows virtually everything that is helpful to you, and doesn't need to know the things that aren't helpful to you. 

05:36:35
LANA Hmm 

05:36:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It may know them, but it can put the unhelpful things in a box, in a trunk, in your garage, in the back of your head, because someday, somehow, it might be useful. 

05:36:55
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:37:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But it doesn't have to be in the forefront. 

05:37:00
LANA Mmm-hmm. 

05:37:05
[sil.] 

05:37:05
LANA Mmm. I can put it, I don't have to throw it away, I can just put it away. 

05:37:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON No, you don't have to throw it - of course not, it's you! Put it in a trunk, with a lock. Put it behind a door that's got a lock. In the garage, on a top shelf, in a box... 

05:37:25
LANA Mmm 

05:37:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...marked "Outgrown." 

05:37:30
LANA Mmm 

05:37:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Cuz you never know when you might want to visit. 

05:37:35
LANA Yeah, yeah. To visit. 

05:37:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. 

05:37:40
LANA I like that idea of 'visiting.' 

05:37:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You don't have to, you can't really throw away. 

05:37:45
LANA But then, if I was just visiting, then I could leave when I wanted. 

05:37:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Leave when you wanted, put the lid back on the box. 

05:37:55
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:37:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because that's your box, your garage... 

05:38:00
LANA Mmm 

05:38:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...your lock... 

05:38:00
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:38:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...your everything. 

05:38:10
[sil.] 

05:38:10
LANA I guess, even though some of these things don't help me, it still makes me sad. 

05:38:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I'm sorry, say that again. 

05:38:25
LANA Even though some of these things aren't helpful to me, right now, the idea of getting rid of them makes me sad. 

05:38:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You're not getting rid of them, Lana. 

05:38:35
LANA Mmm 

05:38:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you remember, or maybe you don't remember - but your children know - when you couldn't cross the street without holding a grown up's hand? 

05:38:50
LANA Mmm. Yeah, they know. 

05:38:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Hmm? 

05:38:50
LANA They know, quite well. 

05:38:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON They're gonna outgrow that... 

05:38:55
LANA Mmm 

05:39:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...aren't they? 

05:39:00
LANA Yeah 

05:39:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Did you outgrow it? 

05:39:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:39:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON If you put on a pair, remember? You probably had a pair of shoes, all nice and shiny, and patent leather? 

05:39:10
LANA Mmm. Mmm-hmm 

05:39:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON They were just gorgeous. 

05:39:15
LANA Mmm 

05:39:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And when you walked, you stared at your feet... 

05:39:15
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:39:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...cuz they were so pretty? 

05:39:20
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:39:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON But you outgrew them. 

05:39:20
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:39:25
[sil.] 

05:39:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Outgrowing doesn't mean getting rid of. 

05:39:35
LANA Hmm. Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Yeah. 

05:39:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's still there, that memory of your patent leather Mary Jane shoes. Was that what they were? 

05:39:50
LANA Yeah, I had Mary Janes. 

05:39:55
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That memory of the patent leather Mary Janes and the way you walked, wherever you walked Certainly, out of the shoe store, starin' at your feet. 

05:40:05
LANA Mmm 

05:40:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That's your memory... 

05:40:05
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:40:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...forever more. If you have a pet that dies, have you had a pet that died? Breaks your heart. 

05:40:20
LANA Mmm. Mmm-hmm 

05:40:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And after a while, you can remember that pet with fondness. 

05:40:30
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

05:40:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And even though he bit ya, maybe, once or twice, it was okay. 

05:40:40
[sil.] 

05:40:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because, when you put it away, you're in charge. 

05:40:50
LANA Mmm 

05:40:55
[sil.] 

05:40:55
LANA Hmm. 

05:41:00
[sil.] 

05:41:00
LANA Yeah. Yeah. I'm still in charge if I put it away. 

05:41:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely! You're in charge of the lock. 

05:41:10
LANA Yeah, where it is. 

05:41:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You can go and get inside that trunk and wallow in it, all you want. You can, cuz it's yours. 

05:41:25
[sil.] 

05:41:30
LANA Yeah, it's still a part of me. 

05:41:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Always 

05:41:35
LANA Hmm 

05:41:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON If you had a broken leg... 

05:41:40
[sil.] 

05:41:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...that pain and that misery is a part of you. 

05:41:45
LANA Mmm. Mmm-hmm 

05:41:50
[sil.] 

05:41:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And when you first got rid of the cast on your broken leg, it was ever-present, and then you forgot to remember. Until you wanted to remember to remember, oh yeah... 

05:42:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:42:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...being in a cast is miserable! 

05:42:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:42:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And then, you can put it away again. 

05:42:15
LANA Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm 

05:42:20
[sil.] 

05:42:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Because you doing what is good for you is good for whom? 

05:42:35
LANA For everybody. 

05:42:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Excellent, excellent! Excellent! That was a test question. You got a A+ because that is true. You're a good... 

05:42:55
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:43:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...decent, honest, hard-working, nice person. So, what you do, is good for everybody. 

05:43:05
LANA Hmm 

05:43:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You may make a acc-, you'll have an accident... 

05:43:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:43:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...drop the Christmas turkey on the floor. 

05:43:15
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:43:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON That's an accident. But what you do... 

05:43:25
LANA Mmm-hmm. Hmm 

05:43:30
[sil.] 

05:43:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...and one last. What's your long term goal? 

05:43:40
[sil.] 

05:43:40
LANA Hmm. Um, to be free and loving in all aspects of my life; my kids, my husband, my work. 

05:44:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Is that your top priority? 

05:44:00
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:44:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Excellent. It's like a sieve. 

05:44:10
[sil.] 

05:44:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And what do you want for your children? I truly love that phrase. 

05:44:20
[sil.] 

05:44:20
LANA To be at ease, to be at peace, to have a joy... 

05:44:30
[sil.] 

05:44:30
LANA ...to have loving relationships. 

05:44:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you wanna finish what you start, or do you wanna leave it open ended? 

05:44:40
LANA About my children? I wanna leave it open ended. 

05:44:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I didn't ask it right. Do you wanna leave that answer? Because, you had three other words in it, that I thought, that I, my own self, liked. 

05:45:05
LANA Hmm 

05:45:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Do you remember them? 

05:45:05
LANA Joy 

05:45:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And? 

05:45:10
LANA Peace 

05:45:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON In? 

05:45:10
LANA The world. Did I say 'loving relationship?' 

05:45:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON No, no, no. You said you wanted them to be "at ease in the world." 

05:45:25
LANA Yeah 

05:45:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Cuz that covers everything. 

05:45:25
LANA Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. It's redundant. 

05:45:35
[sil.] 

05:45:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Is this good, so the audience can ask questions? 

05:45:40
LANA Yeah, it's very good. 

05:45:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And, you have to promise me one thing. 

05:45:45
LANA Yes? 

05:45:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Anything that is discussed, cannot change any of the good work you did, when it's discussed out loud. 

05:46:00
LANA Promise. 

05:46:00
LANA Okay 

05:46:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Pinky promise? 

05:46:05
[sil.] 

05:46:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, great. 

05:46:10
LANA Thank you 

05:46:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON So, thank you. So, now I'm going to talk to the audience. 

05:46:15
LANA Okay. Do you want me to stay up here? 

05:46:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON What's, what's good for, what's good for you? 

05:46:25
LANA I think I wanna stay up here. 

05:46:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Excellent, excellent! What a gal you are! What a gal! 

05:46:35
[sil.] 

05:46:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, this marvelous subject, if anybody wants to ask questions, they can ask questions. 

05:46:50
[sil.] 

05:46:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON There's a microphone. You have to go to the microphone to ask questions. 

05:46:55
UNKNOWN Um, is it on? Is it on? Okay. Um, I noticed that, I usually take a lot of notes, and I'm high energy, and I felt like I fell in a trance just by observing the young lady. 

05:47:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Lana 

05:47:05
UNKNOWN Lana. Um, is that something that does also hap-, I know that they mentioned you could do that with family therapy, by just having. maybe, the family observe the, the child, when they're doing it. Is that something that is possible? 

05:47:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON In my opinion, probably, a good third of the audience was in a trance, because, what you're "problem" was, is almost, kind of, like, it's a very common "problem," with quotation marks. And, if I'm up here, and we're talkin', why wouldn't you wanna listen to, to it also? 

05:48:00
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you. 

05:48:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay? 

05:48:00
UNKNOWN Uh, quick question was, the other one, Lana, did you feel you regressed yourself, because I felt that, really, you were a younger you. 

05:48:10
[sil.] 

05:48:10
LANA Not that I noticed. 

05:48:15
[sil.] 

05:48:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON I thought that she was, Lana, as she is today, but, I thought you were, rearranging things. Is, is that? 

05:48:30
LANA Well, I had a, I mean, now that you say that, I didn't notice anything, but it was like a, um, maybe, a child-like wonder... 

05:48:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yeah. 

05:48:40
LANA ...from the experience, yeah. 

05:48:45
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay, so, it's hard for me to explain what we did, unless I have people ask questions. Thank you. 

05:48:55
UNKNOWN Um, I'm just wondering, do you usually sit that close to your clients? I mean, could, I mean, I almost felt like you could, were like touching her, and when I looked, there was no physical attachments, but it was like you were so connected that, yeah. 

05:49:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Turn your chair back. I was touching her. Although we weren't physically touching her, but we were touching each other, weren't we? Yeah. 

05:49:25
LANA Yeah. 

05:49:25
UNKNOWN So, do you usually sit that close to, when you work with people? 

05:49:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely! In fact, one of my clients once says, "Boy, when you lean forward, I know I'd better listen up." 

05:49:40
[sil.] 

05:49:40
LANA Can I ask a question too? Because, I started out by going to your session, where, you know, we, you were looking at people, eyes were open, and then, mostly since then, everyone's been closing their eyes. Um, but I really liked, you know, the eyes open, um, so, I guess I'm kinda wondering, do alternate between those two things, or do you think that it, when it's only eyes opened, it's? 

05:50:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON When I work with people, I only, when I work with formal trance, I personally like their eyes shut. I work with formal trance with probably less than ten percent of my client load. When we connect, like that, and we're looking at each other, and they don't mean anything, they're not even there. Then, we're both in a trance, and we're both communicating. And it's nice to look at each other. 

05:50:55
LANA I, I'd think it was better, than if I had had my eyes closed. 

05:51:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON For this type of, of trance, this type of work, yeah, that's what I like. Okay? 

05:51:10
UNKNOWN Um, could you elaborate on the, um, story about your brother, when he was holding on to things when he was 3 or 4 and your dad put the paper and started to take the paper? 

05:51:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Oh. 

05:51:20
UNKNOWN I didn't, schweet, it went right over my head. Everybody's chuckling and laughing, and your dad knew and your brother knew, and they both smiled at each other. 

05:51:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON It's, it's actually in, in the book, 'American Healer,' in my brother's chap-, or my chapter, I can't remember. Anyway, Alan had gotten so he was afraid to do something, and you don't tell someone who's afraid, "Don't be afraid," that's ridiculous. Of course, they're going to be afraid; they're afraid! So, A-, Dad gave him a way to hold onto something, that was nice and firm, and then, gradually, took the paper away, so pretty soon, Alan came to the conclusion, "I don't need to hold onto anything." 

05:52:15
UNKNOWN Genius 

05:52:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And he knew, what he remembers, is that, the people in the room were chuckling, but Daddy wasn't, and he wasn't, because they knew there was nothing humorous about what was happening. 

05:52:35
[sil.] 

05:52:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Does that make sense? 

05:52:35
UNKNOWN Oh yeah, thank you. 

05:52:35
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay. 

05:52:40
[sil.] 

05:52:40
UNKNOWN Hi, uh, this is for Betty. Uh, when, when you were interacting with her, you know, staring into each others' eyes, and you had your hand on her... 

05:52:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON We were gazing... 

05:52:50
UNKNOWN ...gazing... 

05:52:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON ...we weren't staring. 

05:52:50
UNKNOWN ...yeah, gazing. Gazing into each others eyes, and you hand your hand on her, I'm just wondering, what was your experience like? How would you describe what was going on, you know, inside? 

05:53:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON In my head? 

05:53:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, inside. 

05:53:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Most of me, my, that's a very good question, most of my head, my heart, all my heart, and most of my head was with you. A piece of me, was really alert, watching your eyes. Shakespeare wasn't wrong when he said "The eyes are the windows to the soul." Looking at your eyes, looking at, if, your face flushed at all. Looking at you. So, I could say what was useful to her. So, I was very intent on you, with ten percent of my head. The rest of me, yeah, we were together. 

05:54:00
LANA Yeah 

05:54:00
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Does that answer? 

05:54:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, it does. 

05:54:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Okay 

05:54:05
UNKNOWN It seems like a heart connection. 

05:54:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Yes, uh-huh.. Did you say heart connection? 

05:54:10
LANA Mmm-hmm 

05:54:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON To me, that is the way to do therapy, because, I am connected to you, that alone is healing. That connection with another human being, who genuinely cares, trusts, and loves, cuz there's love - you know the kind of love I mean? 

05:54:40
LANA Yeah, I know. 

05:54:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Good love. Yeah. And it, that alone, is healing. And the purpose of therapy, is not to change people, it is to heal something that is impeding their process to actualize, to ultimize, that's the purpose of therapy. Does, does that make sense? Okay. 

05:55:20
[sil.] 

05:55:20
UNKNOWN Ah, I would like to thank you, because, um, more than 15 years, I've been coming and doing this sort of thing, and, um, I haven't seen you since, since we were all in Pueblo, if you remember that, and all this time I've been, kind of, fretting about induction and dissociation and whatnot. And, watching you today, because, from Pueblo, up until today, I had not gone to a workshop with you, for some reason. Mostly, because I'm a volunteer, and I go where they send me, uh, I'm very obedient, in that way. Uh, but you, you taught me today that, uh, what I've been doing for a long time is okay, because I do a lot of what you do. I, I think I do, I didn't know that there was a name for it, uh, conversational trance, but that's wonderful. I, now, have a way to justify, uh, my, my existence, and, I tha-, thank you for that, but the thing that you do so absolutely well, is, y-, the silences. Um, I get a little uncomfortable with silence, I think, mostly, because, my clients are so uncomfortable with silence, because I work in Mexico, and, and it's a more verbal, I guess culture. But I, I really like the way you handle silence. You just seem to be totally, totally, uh, ac-, comfortable with it. 

05:57:05
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON You, you're right. Who's session was this? 

05:57:10
UNKNOWN Hers 

05:57:10
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely, she could've broken t he silence anytime she wanted. 

05:57:20
[sil.] 

05:57:20
LANA I like the silence. 

05:57:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Mmm-hmm. Cuz silence helps people to reorganize. Okay? Yeah, it's important. Next question? 

05:57:35
UNKNOWN I just wanted to ask Lana, is that how you say it, Lana? When you think about the question that you came with, do you notice any difference in what happens inside, when you start thinking about it? 

05:57:50
LANA Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I, when I, before when I started thinking, I didn't feel like, tightness in my chest, and worry and fear, and, yeah, I'm not feeling that, now. Even though we're still, you know, on that kind of issue. It's still there, I'm just not feeling the same way inside about it anymore. 

05:58:15
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Good for you. Really, good for you. 

05:58:25
[sil.] 

05:58:25
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Somebody, a volunteer, has to remind me of how much time. Will you keep track? 

05:58:30
UNKNOWN Okay, mi-... 

05:58:30
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Two minutes 

05:58:35
UNKNOWN ...okay, mine is quick. I really appreciated, um, and noticed, how you utilized Lana's, um, her sense of being a mother. Um, I think that, the connection you had with her was, in part, it seemed, to me, somewhat maternal, in a way, and that there was this parallel process between you and Lana and Lana and her children, so that, she could learn from you how to be in the moment, and she could, then, transmit that. And it's something she can retain from you, and, it, it goes on and on and on, generationally. So, I, I, I, I was just floored by that. I mean, I don't know if that's how you viewed it, but, that's what I got from it. 

05:59:40
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON And she promised me that nothing would change. 

05:59:45
[sil.] 

05:59:45
LANA Pinky swore. 

05:59:50
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely. Yes. 

05:59:55
[sil.] 

05:59:55
LANA But, th-, there was another thing that I got, too, that, for me, I guess you tapped into how, that's just a wonderful aspect of my life, and, so, that just made me able to be more deeper into this, sort of, calm, feeling good state. So I think it, this helped facilitate things. 

06:00:20
BETTY ALICE ERICKSON Absolutely. It's really handy to work with a nice, normal mother. Just handy. Okay. Okay, so, you've been a great audience. Lana, you have been fantastic, thank you. 

06:00:50
LANA Thank you.
