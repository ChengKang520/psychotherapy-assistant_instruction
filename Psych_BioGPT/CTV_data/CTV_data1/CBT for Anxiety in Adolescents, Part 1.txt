CBT & Anxiety a training video of a cognitive behavioural approach for treating anxiety in childhood & adolescence designed for use by professionals in child & adolescent mental health services 

00:00:00
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Anxiety is a very common disorder of childhood. Although this may not be apparent when examining the waiting lists of children's mental health services, it is in fact, the most common psychological problem of childhood. Until recently, anxiety in childhood was not regarded as a serious problem and it tended to attract relatively little clinical or research attention. However, in the past decade, the consequences of anxiety at this point in the life cycle had become better understood. It is now widely recognized that anxious children performed poorly in a number of areas including academically and in relationships. Anxiety is also a frequent pathway to other serious mental health problems such as depression and when children attempt to medicate their own symptoms, substance abuse. 

00:01:00
Childhood anxiety and CBT 

00:01:00
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Cognitive behavioural treatments for anxiety in adulthood are well established and researched. In recent years, these approaches have been extended to children and adolescents and results from early clinical trials are very encouraging. The general approach is based on the assumption that emotional difficulties are underpinned by distortions in thinking and information processing. The origins of these distortions are thought to lie in early childhood, that they may not emerge until later in life when an event, such as starting in new school or parental separation triggers the negative thought patterns. In the case of anxiety, the distortions in the young person's thinking usually involve exaggerate perceptions of threat, and the negative perceptions of themselves and their ability to cope with situations. There is a tendency to catastrophize and to always expect the worst, which makes it very difficult to realistically assess and predict the risks. As the sense of threatened uncertainty becomes increasingly pervasive, feelings of apprehension and fear develop and through the physiological responses in the body. These responses are essentially the body's normal physiological reactions to stress and as such do not constitute a health risk or threat. However, the young person's distorted cognitions affect how he interprets and responds to them. There is an over focusing on bodily sensations such as sweating, increased heart rate, nausea, etc., which in turn heightens the sense of threat, triggers more negative thoughts and feeds into a vicious circle of fear and distress. As anxiety levels rise, the common behavioural response is to avoid the stressful situations. This avoidance further reinforces the sense of threat as the young person does not get to find out that his feared catastrophe does not happen. It also confronts his negative perceptions about himself and his ability to cope in an unsafe world. Some young people develop strategies to help them face the threat in the form of safety behaviours. For example, they make it through a special routine or hold on to something in the belief that this will protect them. However, these often become counterproductive as the young person starts to depend on them more and more and to feel less and less able to function without them. As with depression, the cognitive behavioural model of anxiety therefore involves the interaction of thoughts, moods, bodily reactions and behaviours. 

00:03:25
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Based on this model, CBT boldly consists of challenging the negative thoughts of thinking and helping the sufferer praise himself as more able to cope in the world as a safer place. However, adult treatments have needed some adaptation for use with children and adolescents to take into account both developmental issues and the context of young people's lives. In particular, young people should not be treated in isolation, then the context of their families, schools and the wider systems which impact on their world. The programme we are presenting was devised with this in mind. This video has been designed to accompany the treatment manual. The aim of the video is to demonstrate the main techniques described in the manual and to highlight some of the issues which arise in therapy. We wish to emphasize that both the manual and the video are intended as a resource for experienced child and adolescent mental health professionals who already have an understanding of anxiety disorders in children and of the principles of CBT. The manual and video should not be use as a substitute to supervised professional training in CBT. Similarly, practitioners using the manual should have access to supervision while they are undertaking the therapy sessions. 

00:04:40
CBT Programme for Children With Anxiety Disorders 

00:04:40
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  The programme is designed to cover approximately 10 to 12 sessions and is divided into four main phases: assessment and goal setting, education and self-monitoring, developing coping skills, exposure. However, we wish to stress that this is only a general framework, which is designed to be use flexibly in response to the needs of the individual client. We discussed these further in the manual. We again wish to emphasize that the involvement of parents and carers is integral to the whole programme although the exact nature of this involvement will vary. 

00:05:20
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON CBT is essentially a collaborative approach. The young person and therapist work together on problems and issues which have been jointly agreed. However, it is also structured and the therapist ado, adopts an active and directive role throughout the treatment. The focus remains on the here and now, and each session is planned with a clear agenda and structure. Homework is central to the therapy. Its purpose is to reinforce the tasks covered in the session helping the young person apply them to real-life situations. The young person is usually asked to record these tasks in the diary and special sheets is applied for this. These records provide valuable assessment information for the therapist, and homework review performs a vital part of any session. Homework sheets are included in the manual. 

00:06:05
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The next part of the video is- 

00:06:05
The Treatment Programme 

00:06:05
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - designed to illustrate some of the main components of the programme. In the following scenes, the young people are played by actors and the therapist are clinical psychologists working in Manchester. The two vignettes are fictitious, but are fairly representative of the types of anxiety problems which are commonly seen in services. The first, Katie, demonstrates the use of the therapy with the younger age group and emphasizes the beginning stages, while the second, Andrew, shows work with adolescents and particularly focuses on the later stages. We wish to emphasize that the clips are designed to highlights certain techniques and are not intended to show real therapy sessions. Katie is 9 years old and has experienced problems attending school since the beginning of the school year. Prior to this, Katie enjoyed school and always did well presenting as a confident, outgoing child. This year, her teacher, Mr. Jones, is new to the school. The family described him as very different from the teachers Katie is used to. He has a loud deep voice which he uses to control the class, and it appears that Katie has become very frightened of him. A few days into the term, Katie reported feeling sick and dizzy in class. Katie's mother was contacted and Katie stayed with the school secretary until her mother could pick her up. This pattern repeated itself over the next few days. The following week, Katie started to get distressed- 

00:07:35
increasing distress 

00:07:35
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - at the thought of going into school in the morning and her mother described having to fight with Katie to get her dressed and in, into school. Once in school, Katie would not settle and spent much of the time outside the classroom. Her mother is now- 

00:07:50
school refusal 

00:07:50
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - having increasing difficulty actually getting Katie into school at all. Katie lives with her mother, her older brother and her maternal grandparents. Her parents separated when Katie was three, an upsetting event which she appeared to cope with well at the time. Katie and her brother see their father every Saturday at their paternal grandparents house. Her father now has a new partner and they're expecting a baby around Katie's birthday next year. Katie has never met her father's girlfriend and has recently expressed worries about the new baby replacing her, especially if it is a girl. We join Katie at the beginning of the therapy during the assessment session. 

00:08:30
ASSESSMENT Assessment & goal setting Generating a graded hierarchy 

00:08:30
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  The aims of the assessment are as follows: To obtain an understanding of the young person's difficulties. To define areas of strength. To assess suitability for CBT. To explain the nature of the therapy. To build a good rapport with the young person and parent/carer. The first clip shows part of the session. By the time we join them, the therapist has already built up a general picture of Katie's difficulties and has established that the presenting problem of school refusal is related to anxiety. Although Katie has made it clear to the therapist that she does not want to be forced to go back into school, she has said that she is not happy with the way things as they are and would like the therapist to help her. Although rather shy, Katie is willing to speak to the therapist and in fact she became quite animated when talking about her friends and her after-school activities. This initial assessment suggests that Katie is likely to benefit from a cognitive behavioural approach and the therapist has briefly explained what this will involve. But Katie and her mother are keen to try. Given Katie's age, her mother will have an important role in the therapy, so her support and interest is particularly encouraging. At this stage of the assessment the focus becomes more specific. We join the session at the point where the therapist starts to explore in detail what happens when Katie becomes anxious. 

00:10:00
 I wonder if you could talk(ph) me through a recent example and, to know what it's like trying to get Katie into school. I mean when was the last time you tried to get her in? 

00:10:10
MRS. SMITH Uhm, it was terrible. It was in, I think it's about a week ago, and I was trying to get her up in the morning and she was having none of it. She was just kicking and screaming trying to get the uniform on. And then eventually got her out of the house, and then she's yelling at me, telling to go away and like(ph) everyone's looking at us, and then, and then I got her through the gate and then she's clinging on to me like she wouldn't let go and it's just awful. 

00:10:35
 Right, awful. So did you manage to get her into the school building on that day? 

00:10:40
MRS. SMITH Yeah, and yeah. We did that day and, but then I came home and then the school phoned me because she, she'd gone into the classroom but then five minutes later she'd left. She got upset and she'd gone into the secretary's office because she was really distressed and they called me in, so then I came in and took her home and that lunch(ph) and, and then it just started again. She wouldn't, she won't go back. 

00:11:00
 Right, okay. And is that a, a fairly typical day? 

00:11:05
MRS. SMITH Yeah, yeah, and then she gets into the classroom but then she gets upset and she just has to leave again. 

00:11:10
 Right, okay. I mean it certainly sounds like it's really difficult for you to get her in at the moment. 

00:11:15
MRS. SMITH Ye, ye, yeah. 

00:11:15
 Katie, I mean, I wonder how it feels from your point of view? 

00:11:20
KATIE Uhm, it's horrible. 

00:11:20
 Right. 

00:11:20
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:11:20
 Do you remember the day that your Mom is talking about? 

00:11:25
KATIE Yeah. 

00:11:25
 Right. So it sounds like you were, you know, getting quite upset when she first start to get, to try get you up in the morning. What was going through your head at that time. 

00:11:35
KATIE That Mr. Jones is scary. 

00:11:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
 Right. Okay. But then, what's scary about Mr. Jones? 

00:11:40
KATIE It's just, big and scary and he's got a really loud voice. 

00:11:45
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
 Right. Okay. Then when your Mom, uhm, was trying to get you into school, what sort of things were you thinking about then? 

00:11:50
KATIE That I don't want to go to school 'coz I've got told off. 

00:11:55
 Right, so you're worried about getting into trouble. And then your Mom eventually got you into the classroom. Uhm, and you sat down in your class, how are you feeling at that point? 

00:12:05
KATIE Awful. 

00:12:05
 Right(ph). What was going on in your body? 

00:12:10
KATIE Uhm, I'm just alls sick and dizzy and I've felt like I was gonna fall over. 

00:12:15
 Right, (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:12:15
 ...okay. That doesn't sound nice. So what did you do then? 

00:12:20
KATIE I went to the secretary's office. 

00:12:20
 Right, and how did you feel when you got to the secretary's office? 

00:12:25
KATIE Uhm, a bit better. 

00:12:25
 Okay, so you started... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
 ...to feel a bit better then. What happened then? 

00:12:30
KATIE Uhm, they found me, and then my Mom came and get me. 

00:12:35
 Right, okay. 

00:12:35
 It was important for the therapist to elicit descriptions from both Katie and her mother. Although Katie was rather timid, the therapist worked at drawing her into the session by helping her to focus on a specific incident. In asking her about thoughts, feelings, and behaviour, the therapist was not only gaining useful information for herself, but also introducing the main themes of the cognitive behavioural approach. Katie was able to describe her symptoms quite clearly. However, some younger children may have difficulty in doing this. In these cases, the therapist may find it helpful to use visual aids such as dolls or pictures. 

00:13:15
ASSESSMENT Assessment & goal setting Generating a graded hierarchy 

00:13:15
 The aims of goal setting are as follows: To draw up a problem list. To use these as a basis for identifying goals of therapy. Goal setting is a crucial part of the assessment on the engagement process. The therapist already has some sense of Katie's problems however, it is important to get Katie to express them in her own terms and to identify for herself what she hopes the therapy will achieve. A young person's goals will not always be the same as those of the parent or therapists and some negotiation may be needed. However, it is important that the young person's perspective is clearly heard and respected and that she is made to feel that she is an equal partner in the therapy process. For this reason, the therapist should aim to see the child and parent separately for the goal setting exercise. The following clip shows the session between the therapist and Katie. 

00:14:10
 Katie, I've heard quite a bit from your Mom about the things that she feels are a problem at the moment, the things that she's worried about. But I wonder from your point of view, what feels like a problem to you at the moment? 

00:14:20
KATIE Uhm, my panics. 

00:14:20
 Okay, your panics. Anything else that feels like a problem? 

00:14:25
KATIE Being scared. 

00:14:25
 Being scared, okay. Can you tell me a bit more about that? 

00:14:30
KATIE Uhm, well, I just get really scared. 

00:14:35
 What sort of situations do you get scared? 

00:14:35
KATIE Uhm, when I have to go to school. 

00:14:40
 Right, okay. The other things apart from going to school. 

00:14:40
KATIE  Uhm, going out to the shops. 

00:14:45
 Right, okay. Tell me a bit more about that. 

00:14:45
KATIE  Well, I don't like going out without my Mom. 

00:14:50
 Right. So did that hap, is that just going to shops that you feel scared or are there other things? 

00:14:55
KATIE Uhm, no, I don't, uhm, I don't want playing out. 

00:15:00
 Okay, and then those things that you used to enjoy doing. 

00:15:05
KATIE Yeah. 

00:15:05
 Right, okay, uhm, any other things that feel like a problem? 

00:15:10
KATIE Uhm, I want to go back in that class with Pam and Amy. 

00:15:15
 Right. Pam and Amy are your friends, are they? 

00:15:15
KATIE Yeah. 

00:15:15
 Okay, uhm, ah, anything else that you'd, feels like a problem? 

00:15:20
KATIE Uhm, my house. 

00:15:25
 Right. Tell me a bit about that. 

00:15:25
KATIE It's too small. 

00:15:25
 Right. 

00:15:25
KATIE  I want my own bedroom. 

00:15:30
 Okay. 

00:15:30
KATIE And a garden. 

00:15:30
 Okay. Any other things, just to put on the problem list? 

00:15:35
KATIE No. 

00:15:35
 Okay. Well, it's a good list. What I'd like us to do now is go through each of those problems and how to think about how you'd like each of those things to be different. Okay. So, if, if we start with the panics then, how would you like that to be different? 

00:15:50
KATIE Just to stop having them. 

00:15:50
  Right, okay. I'm just gonna write these things down Katie, okay? So, I'll put stop having panics. The second thing you mentioned was that, uhm, you are feeling scared and that was stopping you doing things, going out without your Mom, that was stopping you going to the shops, uhm, and playing out. How would you like that to be different? 

00:16:10
KATIE I just want to get back to normal. 

00:16:15
 Okay, and what would getting back to normal mean? 

00:16:15
KATIE  Uhm, going out to the shops and playing out. 

00:16:20
 Okay. So, if I put down that and you'd like things to get back to normal, which means, uhm, being able to play out as on your own, uhm, and be able to go to the shops on your own. Okay. The next thing you, you mentioned was about school, uhm, and was about sitting next to your classmates. 

00:16:40
KATIE Yeah. I like to sit next to Amy. 

00:16:40
  Okay. So, how would you like that to be different? 

00:16:45
KATIE Uhm, well, I want to go back to school but not with Mr. Jones. 

00:16:50
 Right, okay. So, you'd like to be with your classmates but, but you're not happy about being with Mr. Jones at the moment? 

00:16:55
KATIE Yeah. 

00:16:55
  Okay, uhm, well I'll right that down then. Now, one of the things your Mom mentioned was about school dinners and, and, I understand that the moment that you, you're going home to have dinners with your Mom? I wonder if that was something that you'd like to be different. 

00:17:10
KATIE No. 

00:17:10
 No. Can you tell me a bit about that? 

00:17:15
KATIE Well, I like going home for dinners. We have chips and everything, chips and bagels. 

00:17:20
 Right. Okay, and are there any other reasons why it's hard going to school? 

00:17:25
KATIE 'Coz they all ask me questions. 

00:17:25
 Right. Okay. So, that still feels quite scary? 

00:17:30
KATIE Yeah. 

00:17:30
 Okay. And the last thing you mentioned was about your house. Tell me how you'd like that to be different. 

00:17:35
KATIE I want a big house. 

00:17:40
 Right. Okay. 

00:17:40
KATIE And a bedroom. 

00:17:40
  Right. 

00:17:45
KATIE And a garden. 

00:17:45
 Okay. That's great. Thanks, Katie. 

00:17:45
Problems 1. My panics 2. feeling scared - stops me from doing things 3. Not being in class with Pam & Amy 4. My house 

00:17:45
 The therapist started by generating a problem list. This is quite a concrete task which most children are able to respond to. The therapist accepted without question each problem that Katie mentioned. She then explored it a little more, checking out that she had understood what Katie meant. Although not shown in the clip, it is also often useful to get young person to rate the severity of each problem. 

00:18:10
Goals 

00:18:10
  The question, how would you like it to be different? 

00:18:15
To stop having the panics 

00:18:15
 Helps Katie turn the problems into goals. 

00:18:20
For things to get back to normal 

00:18:20
 The therapist encouraged her to consider alternative goals. 

00:18:20
To be back with my classmates 

00:18:20
 For example, about going into school- 

00:18:25
To live in a bigger house 

00:18:25
 - but continue to respect her wishes. For instance, when Katie was adamant that she wanted to go home at dinnertime. The goal of having a bigger house is clearly outside the limit of therapy, and this will need to be explained to Katie at some point. However, at this, this stage, it was more important that Katie felt respected and listened to. There will be plenty of opportunities for re-negotiation later. 

00:18:45
ASSESSMENT 

00:18:45
  Although presented separately here. Goal setting often forms part of the initial assessment or may be combined with the sessions on generating a graded hierarchy. The aims for generating a graded hierarchy are as follows: To define the situations which lead to feelings of anxiety. To discriminate the different levels of anxiety triggered. To generate an ordered list of anxiety provoking situations. The goal setting exercise served as a useful assessment tool and will help to shape the overall content and direction of the therapy. The next task is to break these broad goals down further. To do this, Katie and her mother are invited to think of situations which make Katie anxious, and to rate how anxious they make her feel. The anxiety ratings are then used to put the situations in order, starting with the least stressful. The hierarchy will be used later in therapy to guide the program of graded exposure. However, at this stage, the exercise also serves as a useful introduction to self-monitoring, by encouraging the child to start discriminating between different levels of anxiety and also to notice the specific triggers. The session starts with the review of the goals which Katie has already identified. 

00:20:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
  Okay. I've been talking to each of you about the sorts of goals that you, you'd like to work on when you come in here. Uhm, we've agreed to meet again today to talk about those goals and, and agree together jointly what we're gonna work towards. 

00:20:25
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:20:25
 So, I've got down here. First of all, the goals that Katie wanted. So her first one was she wanted to stop having the panics. 

00:20:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
  The second one was, uhm, she wanted to get back to normal. By that, I think she meant, she wanted to be able to play out and go to the shops, do things like that... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
 ... on her own again without feeling scared. Uhm, the third one well, she said she'd like to be back with some of her old classmates but, but she didn't want to be back with Mr. Jones. 

00:20:50
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
 And we did talk a bit about school dinners and Katie's quite clear that, that was something she didn't want to do. She was, she preferred to carry on coming home and I feel that was for a couple of reasons she, she talked about. She enjoys coming home and, and seeing you, and... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
 ...and things. But also, I think she's a bit worried about the questions she might get if she was to go back into school for dinners, what the other children might say to her. 

00:21:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
 And, and then lastly, Katie, wanted a, a bigger house. And then, Mrs. Smith, your goals were there, uhm, you wanted to get Katie back into Mr. Jones's class full-time, staying in school for dinners, but with her feeling happy about doing that and... (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
 ...not scared. 

00:21:30
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:21:30
 So I think, we can say that there are some areas of agreement there. Uhm, there are some things that you both want but, some parts, I guess, where there's a bit of disagreement on the side, that's what I want us to think about today... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
 ...trying to agree together what we're gonna work towards. 

00:21:45
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

00:21:45
 So, I mean I think, one goal that you both wanted was for Katie to stop having the panics. Is that right? 

00:21:50
MRS. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
KATIE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

00:21:50
  Okay. And I think, perhaps actually that you both want Katie to be in school a bit more. 

00:21:55
KATIE  No. 

00:22:00
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
 Okay. Well, I wonder if, uhm, that the part that there's some disagreement on is, is where you're going to be. 'Coz Mrs. Smith, you like Katie to be back in Mr. Jones's class. But Katie, you'd like to see some more of your classmates, wouldn't you, but not to be with Mr. Jones', is that right? 

00:22:15
KATIE Yeah. 

00:22:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:22:15
  Okay. Well I wonder Katie, how would you feel about being in Mr. Jones's class? If you didn't feel scared, if you didn't get the panics, you didn't feel sick and dizzy and like you're gonna fall over, but you felt okay and quite happy. I thought you used to feel it when you're in Mrs. Peacock's class? 

00:22:30
KATIE  Uhm, it should be okay, but I don't know how you're gonna do it. 

00:22:35
 Right. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
  Okay, but you could imagine that being okay? 

00:22:40
KATIE Yeah. 

00:22:40
 And what about school dinners as well, I wondered if you might feel okay about staying for school dinners if you weren't worried about missing your Mom, uhm, and you, you weren't worried about what other people are going to say you. 

00:22:50
KATIE Yes. I was. 

00:22:55
 Right. So, you could imagine that, that feeling okay to you. 

00:22:55
KATIE (inaudible ) 

00:22:59
  Uhm, you see, what I suggest we do is, is aim for getting you back in Mr. Jones's class. But that we aim for doing that in small steps. And so we wouldn't move you on to the next step until you felt perfectly happy about the step before. I don't know... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
 ...if that makes sense. 

00:23:10
KATIE  Yeah, but do I have to go and see Mr. Jones? 

00:23:15
 No, no. You wouldn't have to do that to start with at all. I wonder if we should have a go drawing up these steps. Uhm, 'coz I think, that might give you a better idea of what we're talking about. Would that be okay? 

00:23:25
KATIE  Yeah. 

00:23:30
 Okay, what I've got here is a thermometer. Okay, and this is called a Fear Thermometer. And you can see that it's got numbers up the side, going from none(ph) at the bottom all the way up to ten. 

00:23:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
 Okay. And no(ph), is for when you don't feel scared at all and ten is to represent when you feel really, really scared, the most scared you've ever felt before. Okay? 

00:23:50
KATIE Yeah. 

00:23:50
 What I'd like for us to do is have a go at drawing up some of those small steps we've been talking about, small steps towards getting back into Mr. Jones's class and, I'd like for you to tell us, how scared they would make you feel on this thermometer, that makes sense? 

00:24:05
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:24:05
 Okay. Can you have a hold of that? I wonder if any of us can come up with some ideas of what might be some small steps towards getting Katie back in Mr. Jones's class? 

00:24:15
KATIE Uhm, I don't know? 

00:24:15
MRS. SMITH  Well, what if and, we got you back into school but you didn't go into the class? 

00:24:20
KATIE  Yeah, I could uhm, go and see the secretary. 

00:24:25
 Okay, I see. If you mention going to see the secretary, where would that come on this thermometer? 

00:24:30
KATIE  About two. 

00:24:35
 About a two. Okay, so a little bit worried but not very scared. Okay, that's good. What other situations can you imagine in school? 

00:24:40
KATIE Uh, do I have to go and see Mr. Jones? 

00:24:45
 No, you don't have to. 

00:24:45
KATIE Uhm, I could, to go and see into Mrs. Peacock's class with my Mom. 

00:24:50
  Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
 So you could imagine spending... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
 ...some time in Mrs. Peacock's class with your Mom there. Where would that come on the thermometer? 

00:25:00
KATIE About three. 

00:25:05
 About a three, okay. What about if your Mom wasn't in the class with you but she was nearby? 

00:25:10
KATIE Uhm, about four. 

00:25:15
 Four. Okay, so a little bit more worried. What about if your Mom wasn't in school at all, your Mom was at home but you're in Mrs. Peacock's class? Where would that come? 

00:25:20
KATIE About five. 

00:25:25
 Right, okay, about five. Good. Now, I know you told me before that, that being in Mr. Jones's class makes, makes you feel very scared... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
 ...that comes about to ten, is that right? 

00:25:35
KATIE Yeah. 

00:25:35
 Okay. What about being in Mr. Jones's class with your Mom there as well, where would that come? 

00:25:40
KATIE Uh hmm, about eight. 

00:25:45
 Okay. So a bit, a little bit less scary. 

00:25:45
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

00:25:45
  Okay. Well, that's a great start. So, if we write those out now, we've got some nice steps, uhm, going from quite low levels of anxiety all the way up to a ten. 

00:25:55
KATIE  Going into Mr. Jones's class would be about ten or eleven though. 

00:26:00
  Ah, an eleven. But that's okay. That's fine. But can you see how we can work up these steps. We can give you some things to do that will help you feel better in these situations and we won't get you to move on from one step in, onto the next step until you feel okay about the one before. Does that make sense? 

00:26:20
KATIE Yeah. 

00:26:20
 Okay. 

00:26:20
KATIE  Do I have to go into Mr. Jones's class then? 

00:26:25
 No, no. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
 To start with, uhm, we get you thinking about the steps at the bottom, the low levels of anxiety one. But we're going to do some talk, more talking first. 

00:26:35
KATIE Okay. 

00:26:35
 It was important that Katie and her mother could reach an agreement on goals before embarking on the next stage of therapy. There will usually be at least some areas of disagreement between the parent and young person. In this instance, Mrs. Smith was keen that Katie should return to school full-time, in contrast to Katie whose main goal was to be with her friends but not in the present class. Having talked to each of them separately, the therapist was able to emphasize the main areas of overlap and to ensure that Katie's views were not overridden by her mother's, while at the same time, not dismissing the mother's wishes. Katie was clearly terrified at the idea of returning to Mr. Jones's class. The therapist was sensitive to this and to Katie's need to feel safe within the therapy program. The message of small steps and lots of support needs to be very clear at this stage. It is also important to let the child know that there won't be any surprises and to emphasize that the process is one of collaboration. The attitude of the parent can be crucial in communicating this and the therapist may find it helpful to spend part of the session discussing it separately with the parent. In Katie's case, this was unnecessary since her mother had quickly picked up on her need for reassurance. The Fear Thermometer is a useful concrete aid for helping younger children rate their anxiety. With younger children, the graded hierarchy can also be presented in other terms. For instance, in the form of a ladder. The different situations are written on separate pieces of card where the child then places unto the rungs(ph). 

00:28:10

00:28:10
 By the end of the assessment phase, there should be broad agreement between the therapist, young person, and parent- 

00:28:15
ASSESSMENT Assessment and Goal Setting Generating A Graded Hierarchy 

00:28:15
 - about the nature of the problems and the main areas which needs to be addressed. In planning future sessions, the therapist will also need to think about how to involve the parent and family. As Katie's still quite young, the therapist will want her mother to take an active part in the programme. This is unlikely to, to be problematic because they appear to have a good relationship, and Mrs. Smith is supportive of both Katie and the therapy. However, in other cases, the therapist may prefer to spend time separately with the parents, exploring their, their needs and attitudes and working to increase their understanding of anxiety and its treatment. The next phase of the program, which focuses on education, provides a good opportunity for this. 

00:29:00
CBT Programme For Children With Anxiety Disorders ASSESSMENT EDUCATION DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS EXPOSURE 

00:29:00
  There are two main components to the education section of the program. 

00:29:05
EDUCATION Anxiety education Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self-monitoring 

00:29:05
 The first focuses on the nature of anxiety and the second on helping the young person to recognize and understand their own responses. The aims of anxiety education are as follows: To help the young person understand, how anxiety affects him or her, how anxiety can be triggered, how anxiety can be maintained and reinforced. 

00:29:30
  Now Katie, what I'd like first to do is to, is try and remember from the last times that you got really scared and how to think about what that, what that felt like. Can you remember when was the last time you got scared? 

00:29:45
KATIE Uhm, when I have to go to school... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
 Right. 

00:29:45
KATIE ...uhm, last week. 

00:29:50
 Okay. And can you remember when you were walking up to the school gate, how did that feel? 

00:29:55
KATIE It was horrible. I was crying. 

00:29:55
 Right. Okay. What we will do is I'm gonna draw a picture of you here. I'm not very good at drawing. Okay. And now let me start off, we, can you draw in a picture of your face, to show me how you were feeling on that day. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:20
  Okay. So you were feeling pretty scared on that day. That's a really scared face. Well done. I wonder if we can have a think about, you know, how else you were feeling i, in your body. What else is going on? 

00:30:35
KATIE  It felt, uhm, I was sick and dizzy and my legs are wobbling like I was gonna fall over. 

00:30:45
 Okay. So we go through those one at a time. So you're feeling sick in your tummy. Let's draw that one. You tell me feeling all wobbly. Okay, what was the next thing you told me about? 

00:30:55
KATIE That I was dizzy. 

00:30:55
 Right. So your head was feeling funny or dizzy. And what was the last thing you mentioned? 

00:31:00
KATIE That my legs were wobbly and I was gonna fall over. 

00:31:05
 Right. So your legs felt a little wobbly. Let us draw that in. Okay. Well you know you got all this same sorts of feelings that the other children that come and see me tell me about, and they tell me that that feels really horrible. What do you think? 

00:31:20
KATIE Yeah. It feels horrible. 

00:31:20
  Okay. What, what I'd like to do is tell you a story about a time when we were cavemen and dinosaurs ro, roam the land, which I think might help to explain to you a little bit about why you get those, these funny feelings in your body when you feel scared. Okay. All right. I'm gonna draw a picture of a caveman here. Okay. Now(ph) then(ph). This is a pretty scared caveman. And he's scared because there's a big dinosaur over here. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:00
  And he's a very hungry dinosaur. Okay. Now, if you were this caveman, what would you do right now? 

00:32:10
KATIE I'd run away really fast. 

00:32:15
 Yes, you know, I think that's what I'd do too. Now what do our bodies have to do if we're gonna run really fast? 

00:32:20
KATIE I don't know. 

00:32:20
 You don't know. What does your heart do when you run really fast? 

00:32:25
KATIE It beats a lot. 

00:32:25
 Right. It beats really fast, that's right. 'Coz it's got to get all the blood around your body, to your muscles so that you can run. I'm gonna draw that in. Now, here's our caveman with his heart beating really fast. Okay. So what happens in your muscles then, when you run really fast? How do your legs feel? 

00:32:40
KATIE  Uhm, tired out. 

00:32:45
 Right. And a bit wobbly too, a bit shaky? 

00:32:45
KATIE Yeah. 

00:32:45
  Let's draws a caveman and then with his shaky legs 'coz he's running really fast. Okay. And what's(ph) about uhm, your head? You see, I want to think this caveman is gonna have to do quite a lot of quick thinking, isn't he? He's trying to work out how he's gonna get away from this dinosaur. So I wonder, I wonder if his head's feeling a bit strange too? Yes? (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
KATIE Well, yes. 

00:33:10
 So we put his head in feeling strange. 'Coz his body's got to get all the blood and oxygen up there as well. Okay. And what about breathing? What happens to your breathing when you run really fast? 

00:33:20
KATIE Uhm. It's very fast. 

00:33:25
 Right. Can you show me? That's right. I bet you can run really fast. That's right, 'coz you're breathing in to get all the oxygen in to fuel your muscles. I'd like to draw this caveman in breathing really fast. Here we go, and his lungs are working hard. Now if our caveman keeps breathing really fast for a while, what, what's that gonna feel like? What happens when you breathe really fast for a while? 

00:33:50
KATIE I don't know. 

00:33:50
 You don't know. When I did, I start to feel dizzy after a while. Have you had that? 

00:33:55
KATIE Yeah. 

00:33:55
 Yeah. And it starts to hurt a bit here as well, doesn't it? 

00:34:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:34:00
 So let's draw that in, his face. It's getting a bit sore around here. Okay. So we've got our caveman here feeling very scared because he's being chased by this hungry dinosaur, and he's got all these things going on in his body. You know, that reminds me of something, reminds me a bit of the funny feelings you get in your body when you feel scared. So it's just your body saying, "Uh-oh, Here's a dinosaur. Got to get ready to run away." 

00:34:25
KATIE But we don't have dinosaurs anymore. 

00:34:30
 You're right. We don't have dinosaurs anymore, do we? But our bodies are bit old-fashioned, you see, and they don't know that. So, so when they get those feelings, its, its just them getting ready to run away from, from something scary. But we do have modern things, don't we, that make us feel scared? Lets cross out this dinosaur here. Can you think any, of any modern things that makes you feel scared? 

00:34:50
KATIE  School. 

00:34:55
 Right. Why don't you go, go draw in your school there. That's great. So when you get those scared feelings when you go to school, it's just your body saying to you, "Uh-oh, here's a dinosaur. I'm getting ready for you to run away." Okay. So does that explain where you get all those funny feelings in your body when you get scared? 

00:35:20
KATIE Yeah. It feels horrible though. 

00:35:20
 Your right. It does feel horrible, but it's just your body getting ready to run away, those feelings aren't gonna do you any harm. Okay? 

00:35:30
KATIE Yeah. 

00:35:30
 We should get your mom back in and, and lets have a go to(ph) explaining this to her because I don't think she'll know about this. And I can help you out if you get a bit stuck, okay? (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
KATIE  Okay. 

00:35:40
 Children of Katie's age normally respond well to such approaches, which keep them active and involved in the session. Asking Katie to explain it to her mother afterwards allow the therapist to check that she'd understood and also kept Mrs. Smith involved in the process. The therapist would normally give the mother a written information sheet to reinforce the work during the session. 

00:36:00
EDUCATION Anxiety education Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self-monitoring 

00:36:00
 Anxiety education leads into the sharing of the formulation in which the therapist helps Katie and her mother to apply the general principles of anxiety and anxiety cycles to their own situation. The formulation also provides a rationale for the therapy. 

00:36:15
Sharing the formulation 

00:36:15
  The aims of formulation are as follows: To share the formulation with the young person, To share the formulation with the family. In the first scene with Katie alone, the therapist concentrates on the links between thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and very simply introduces the idea that how we respond to a situation is tied up with our initial appraisal of it. 

00:36:40
 Okay, Katie. Today we said we'd have to think about uhm, the problems you've been having with anxiety and how we might understand those. And I've got here a couple of situations I want you to have a think about. Here we go, a girl about your age is lying in bed at night and she's well cannot(ph) because she's heard a noise. What she thinks to herself is, "Oh no, someone's breaking into the house!" How'd you think that girl might feel? 

00:37:05
KATIE Uhm, scared. 

00:37:05
 Scared, good, okay. And what do you think she might do if she feels scared? 

00:37:10
KATIE Uhm, she might run into her mom's bedroom and tell her about the noise. 

00:37:15
 Right. I think your right. Okay, I'm writing it on there. Now, I've got another picture. This is the same girl in bed and she's woken up because she's heard the same noise, but this time she thinks to herself, "Oh it's just the cat. He must have knocked over the pot plants again." How do you think the girl's gonna feel this time? 

00:37:35
KATIE She'll feel all right. 

00:37:40
 Okay. And what do you think uhm, she'll do if she feels all right? 

00:37:45
KATIE Uhm, I think she'd fee, uhm, I think she'd just go back to sleep. 

00:37:50
 Right. I think your right. Okay. So let's have a look at these. Here we've got the same girl in an identical situation, but this one, she wakes up and thinks, "Oh no, someone's breaking into the house!" She feels scared and so she runs into her mom's room. And this time, in this one, she thinks, "Oh, it's just the cat", uhm, and, and like you said, she feels okay that time and she just turns over and goes back to sleep. So it's the same situation but she feels differently and ends up doing different things. Why do you think that is? 

00:38:25
KATIE Well, in the first drawing, she was scared 'coz she thought someone was breaking in, but in the second one, she thought it was just the cat and she just went back to sleep. 

00:38:35
 Right, good. Well done. So we've got the same situations but she's just having different thoughts in them, isn't she? And that ends up with her feeling different and doing different things. I wonder if we could have a think about some of your thought bubbles in the situations that made you feel scared. Okay, let's have a think about the times when you're going to Mr. Jones' class. Tell me what's going on in your thought bubble? 

00:39:00
KATIE Uhm, well I feel really scared and. 

00:39:00
  You feel really scared, but what thoughts are going through your head? 

00:39:05
KATIE That I don't want Mr. Jones 'coz he's scary. 

00:39:10
 Right. And what's scary 'bout Mr. Jones? 

00:39:15
KATIE Well he's just big and loud and scary. 

00:39:15
 He's big and loud. Okay. Ah, when you get thoughts like that, how do you feel? 

00:39:25
KATIE Well, I feel really sick and dizzy and cold, my breathing goes fast and I think I'm gonna fall down and faint. 

00:39:35
 Right. So you feel sick, dizzy, and cold. Your breathing goes fast and you think you're gonna fall down. Okay. And so what do you do when you feel like that? 

00:39:45
KATIE Uhm, I always leave the classroom. 

00:39:50
 Right. Okay. Well that, that makes a lot of sense. So when you go into school and to Mr. Jones' class, you start thinking to yourself that he's scary; that he's big and loud and you find him, and that gives you feelings in your body where you feel sick and dizzy and cold; your breathing goes really fast. And then you start thinking that your gonna faint or fall down so you leave the classroom. Now I remember a time you told me about when you managed to stay in the classroom 'coz you were playing on the computer. What do you think you have been think about that day, remember that day? 

00:40:20
KATIE Yeah. 

00:40:20
  Okay. What was, what was going on in, in your head on that day? What was in your thought bubble when you were playing on the computer? 

00:40:30
KATIE I'm enjoying this. I really like this. 

00:40:30
  Okay. What other thoughts did you have? 

00:40:35
KATIE Uhm, I thought that, uhm, Michael must be really jealous 'coz he's a boy in the class that always gets to go on the computer. 

00:40:45
 Right. Okay. So when you're having those thoughts, how were you feeling on this day? 

00:40:50
KATIE And I was feeling all right. 

00:40:55
 Its sounds like you quite enjoyed it? 

00:40:55
KATIE Yeah. 

00:40:55
  Yeah. Okay. And so what did you do? 

00:41:00
KATIE I must've stayed in the classroom and just played on the computer. 

00:41:05
 Right. It's good. 

00:41:05
  So, I think that's a really good example of, of quite a similar situation but where(ph) your thoughts were quite different, weren't they? This, this day when you had this scary thoughts, you ended up feeling quite bad and leaving the classroom, but on this time, uhm, when you're having good thoughts about enjoying things, and playing on the computer, you felt okay and, and happy, didn't it, didn't you? And you managed to stay in the classroom and, and quite enjoy playing on the computer. So I think, does that make sense? When you get the worrying thoughts, you, you end up feeling bad and leaving the situation, but when your thought are about a good thing, you feel better, and you end up staying in the situation, is that right? Have I got that right? 

00:41:50
KATIE Yeah. 

00:41:50
 Okay. I wonder if we could get your mom back in now and it's, have a go at explaining these pictures to her. Would you have a go with that? 

00:42:00
KATIE Okay. 

00:42:00
 The therapist again adapted her approach to Katie's age by using cartoon pictures. She also briefly introduced the idea of thought bubbles which will be picked up in more detail during the self-monitoring session. Our formulation was very simple. Rather than offering complicated causal explanations for Katie's problems, her aim was to help Katie understand her experiences in terms of how here and now responses to threat. Perceptions of threat was a clear theme. At first, when they were looking at the two cartoon pictures and later when the therapist got Katie to contrast her two very different experiences within the same setting of Mr. Jones' classroom. At this stage, the emphasis was on giving Katie a way of talking about what was happening in terms of thoughts, feelings, and behavior rather than focusing too directly on issues of avoidance or maintenance of anxiety. In contrast during the following clip with Katie's mother, the therapist is more direct and explicit, exploring the whole anxiety cycle with her. Together, they looked at, at the probable predisposing factors, the recent triggers and the role of avoidance in maintaining the cycle. 

00:43:10
  Right. Katie and I have been thinking about some of the anxiety cycles that she gets caught up in but... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
 ...I wanted us to spend, uhm, a bit of time today thinking about why she may have developed these problems. And I know, we've, (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
MRS. SMITH Right. 

00:43:25
 we've had a bit, to think about some of the possible reasons, but I wanted us to talk about that more today and see what you thought about that. 

00:43:30
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

00:43:30
 Okay. So then, I mean, the first thing is I think we know that the way we're made, uhm, you know, can sometimes make us more vulnerable to developing problems. And then I was told(ph) about how Katie's quite a shy child really. Uhm, and she's always been that way, I think. 

00:43:45
MRS. SMITH Yeah. She has been(ph) since she's been very little. She's always to being quite clingy(ph) really and quite, yeah, quite shy. 

00:43:55
 Yeah. And I know... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
 ...when I first met her she is, she's quite shy and found it hard to talk to me, (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
 ...and, and I think that might make some situations difficult for her. 

00:44:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. Yes. She, yeah, it was strange. It was difficult when she started school, it was the same. And she got some of the(ph) friends now but it took long time for her to sort of make friends. 

00:44:10
  Right. 

00:44:15
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

00:44:15
 So it seems that, that can make, uhm, children more vulnerable to developing anxiety problems. 

00:44:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
 And then when, when situations come along, uhm, they can sometimes find them difficult to cope with. And I know... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
 ...we've talked about how, you know, recently Katie has had to cope with, for example, starting in a new class at school. 

00:44:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. Yeah. And then she'll say, uhm, "I'm without(ph) a dad 'coz he's just got a, a partner. He's having a new baby. He's having a baby soon." And then the other day, Katie was asking me if it's a girl, would that, would she replace her. So, I think she's being really worried about that. 

00:44:45
 Yes, right. (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

00:44:45
  Well, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
MRS. SMITH Yeah(ph). 

00:44:50
 ...it seems like that, that have triggered the problems for Katie now. That's... (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
 ...that's why they started now. And I think these anxiety cycles that we've been thinking about is, it's what's maintained the problem. It's what... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
MRS. SMITH Right. 

00:45:00
 ...kept it going. And I think, particularly thought that it's now got to a point where Katie's tending to avoid the situations she's finds difficult, isn't she? (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
 And she also, or she's tending to escape from them... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
 ...to (inaudible ) the class. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:45:12
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:12
 and I think, you know, what, what that means is she's, she's not learning that if she stays in the situation, actually her anxiety will come down and she'll start... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
 ...feeling better. 

00:45:20
MRS. SMITH 'Coz she's just getting really upset and she, yeah, yeah. It's so really difficult 'coz she's, gets where (inaudible ). 

00:45:29
  That's right. So, (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
 I know it's hard, isn't it, to get through in to those situations. 

00:45:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
  And I guess the other thing is she's, she's going to look to you for support, hasn't she? So, (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:45:35
 when she starts getting scared, so, I think if you're not there, she finds it quite difficult to manage those feelings that she gets. 

00:45:40
MRS. SMITH  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:45
 So I think, what, what I'm hoping that we can do is, is give Katie some, some different coping skills, some things that can help her deal with these feelings that she gets. Uhm, and also to, to try to stop her avoiding some of these things that she finds difficult. 

00:45:55
MRS. SMITH Right. Okay. 

00:46:00
 Okay. 

00:46:00
 Katie's mother was very open about Katie's shy nature and also about the problems with her father's new family. However, these are sensitive issues for parents and need to be approached carefully by the therapist. 

00:46:10
PREDISPOSING FACTORS Shy disposition Mum & Dad separated Difficulties with school PRECIPITANT Dad's new family Starting new class TRIGGER Going into school Going into shops - situation on her own 

00:46:10
  Equally sensitive is the role of the family in maintaining the child's anxiety. The therapist needs to be alert to this possibility and if it arises to consider carefully when and how to help the family recognize and address the problem. In Katie's case, this happens later during the exposure phase. But in some cases, the session on sharing the formulation will be an appropriate place to start looking at it. 

00:46:40
ASSESSMENT EDUCATION DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS EXPOSURE 

00:46:40
 The other educational component of the program involves teaching the young person to recognize- 

00:46:45
EDUCATION Anxiety education Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self Monitoring 

00:46:45
 - and monitor their emotions. This technique is similar to that used for treating depression, but here, the emphasis is on the thoughts, feelings and behaviors which are specifically related during anxiety. The aims of emotional recognition and self-monitoring are as follows: Emotional Recognition; to clarify the meaning of different emotions and establish a shared language, to help young person distinguish between different emotional states, to start making links between emotions, feelings, and behaviour. Self Monitoring; to develop the young person's ability to separate events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviour patterns, to introduce the idea that physical reactions serve as cues to begin using coping strategies, to provide more information for the therapist about the young person's anxiety patterns. Young people vary in their ability to distinguish different emotional states, and in some cases, the whole session will be devoted to this. However, in other cases, the therapist may choose to cover the material fairly briefly using the techniques of emotional recognition as a way of introducing the more complex skill of self monitoring. This is what happens in the following clip. 

00:48:00
 Okay. Katie, how about picking a card. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:05
  All right, what does it say? 

00:48:10
KATIE Angry. 

00:48:10
 Okay, what I want you to do is tell me about a situation that somebody might feel angry in. 

00:48:15
KATIE Uhm, my mom, brother's, somebody or me? 

00:48:20
 It can be anybody. It doesn't have to be you. 

00:48:20
KATIE Uhm, well, my brother steals my pens. 

00:48:25
 Right, okay. Uhm, and how does that make you feel? I know it makes you feel angry. But how does that feel? 

00:48:30
KATIE  Uhm, it makes you feel that you wanna punch him. 

00:48:35
 Right, okay. What's going on in your body when you feel angry? 

00:48:40
KATIE Uhm, you feel like running and like punching. 

00:48:45
 Okay, and how about your muscles? How do they feel? 

00:48:45
KATIE They are tighter and your head feels like it's gonna explode. 

00:48:50
 Right, well done. What's going on in your head there? What thoughts run through someone's head when they're feeling angry? 

00:48:55
KATIE  I hate him. 

00:49:00
 Right, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
KATIE I hate him. 

00:49:00
  Why do you hate him? What is it that's, what's the part that's making you feel angry? 

00:49:05
KATIE 'Coz he stole my pens. 

00:49:10
 Right, okay. What's bad about that. 

00:49:10
KATIE It's not fair. He shouldn't do stuff like that. 

00:49:15
 Okay, what might somebody do in that situation then? 

00:49:15
KATIE Uhm, you might push him. 

00:49:20
 Okay, good. So, you've given me a really good, cle, pic, clear picture there of what somebody might feel, what they might think, what might they do when they feel angry. Okay, Katie, why don't you take another card? 

00:49:35
[sil] 

00:49:35
  Okay, what does that one say? 

00:49:40
KATIE Afraid. 

00:49:40
 Okay. So, tell me a situation which somebody might feel afraid. 

00:49:45
KATIE Uhm, if they have to stand up and do the prayer in assembly. 

00:49:50
 Well, okay, that's a good situation. So, somebody might feel afraid then. Tell me how that would feel. 

00:49:55
KATIE Uhm, they might feel sick. 

00:50:00
 Sick? That's a good one, yes. How else might they feel? 

00:50:00
KATIE They might have, uhm, butterflies in their tummy. 

00:50:05
 Right. Good. 

00:50:05
KATIE Uhm, like pins and needles, like pins and needles in their toes and fingers. 

00:50:10
 Right, that's another good one. Well done. What sort of thoughts might somebody be having if they're have(ph) to stand up in an assembly and read a prayer? 

00:50:20
KATIE Uhm, well, I think they're too scared. 

00:50:25
 Okay. Then, what, what is it that might be making him too scared? 

00:50:25
KATIE  Well, that everybody's watching. 

00:50:30
 Right, okay. What's it about if everybody watching? 

00:50:35
KATIE Well, you might say it wrong. 

00:50:35
 Okay, what might happen if, if you do say it wrong? 

00:50:40
KATIE Uhm, they might laugh. 

00:50:40
 They might laugh? Okay, right. Good. And, and what's in, you've got a person feeling really scared that about reading out prayer in assembly. What do you think that person might do? 

00:50:50
KATIE  They might not come to school. 

00:50:55
 Right, then the child found a way of getting out(ph) of doing it. 

00:51:00
KATIE Yeah. I can't do it. I won't, I won't do it. I couldn't do it. 

00:51:00
  Okay, that's good, Katie. Well done. Ah, what I'd like you to do now for me Katie is some homework, uhm, between now and the next time we meet. I'd like you to keep some records of each time that you feel scared. And I've got some sheets here, uhm, for you to do it on, as you can see, there's a little picture of a person. So, each time you feel scared, the first thing I want you to do is to draw any expression on your face, ah, you know, to show how you're feeling at that time. Can you show me how it might look? Yeah, that's right. That's good. So, draw in that face to me and then write in this space on the body all the feelings that you've got going on in your body. Then, when you've done that I want you to look at this thermometer. Remember, we've used this before and mark on it how scared do you feel. So no(ph) would be not scared at all and ten would be the most scared that you've ever felt. Then, on the head, you'll see there's a big thought bubble. So in here, what I want you to do is to write the thoughts that go through your head at the time. And the last thing I want you do in this box here is to write in what you did, okay? (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
KATIE Okay. 

00:52:05
 What we do is we'll get your Mom to write in, you know, what the situation was that was making you feel scared. So, I thought we could do today is fit in, in an example so you get an idea of what it is, uhm, that I've asked you to do. So, can, let's start off by thinking when was the last time you felt really scared? 

00:52:20
KATIE Uhm, when I had to go to school last week. 

00:52:25
 Right, when your Mom wanted you to go to school, is that right? Okay, I wonder if you could start off by drawing in for me the expression on your face and to show how you are feeling on that day. 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:35
  That's good. Now, it's a scared, non-happy face and could you knot(ph) for me on the thermometer as well how scared were you feeling on that day? That was an eight, okay. So, you were feeling pretty scared on that day. 

00:52:55
KATIE Yeah(ph). 

00:52:55
  Okay. Now, then, we've got that you are feeling scared and that was about an eight. How are you feeling in your body? What sorts of feelings did you have? 

00:53:05
KATIE Well, I was feeling sick and dizzy... (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
 Sick and dizzy. (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
KATIE I'm sick. 

00:53:10
 Right, sick and dizzy. Okay. Now let's have a think. What thoughts were going through your head? What were you thinking about? 

00:53:20
KATIE That I didn't want to go. 

00:53:20
 You didn't want to go to school? Okay. Tell me a bit more about that. 

00:53:25
KATIE Uhm, I just felt scared 'coz Mr. Jones is too scary. 

00:53:30
 So, you're thinking that Mr. Jones is scary? Okay, what else did you think? 

00:53:35
KATIE Well, that he has gonna shout on me and I have a panic. 

00:53:40
 Right, okay. What would happen if you had a panic? 

00:53:45
KATIE I'll fall over. 

00:53:45
 Right, okay. I'm just writing that down, fright and fall over. Okay. So, what did you do then? 

00:53:55
KATIE I didn't get out of bed and I wouldn't get ready. 

00:54:00
 Right, okay. I wouldn't get ready. That's really good. Okay. So, can you see how we've filled that in as an example? 

00:54:15
KATIE Yeah. 

00:54:15
 Okay. Uhm, what I like us to do now is get your mom back in and, and like I was explaining to her. 

00:54:20
KATIE Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
 Would you ever go doing that? 

00:54:20
KATIE Okay. 

00:54:20
  Okay, Katie, I wonder if you could explain to your Mom then what I've asked you to when filling these sheets in each time that you feel scared between now and the next time we meet. 

00:54:30
KATIE Okay. 

00:54:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:54:30
KATIE Well, I've got to fill in how scared I am in the situation and you've got to write what my situation is. 

00:54:40
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

00:54:40
KATIE Uhm, I've got to draw my face and see how scared it is. Then, I've got to draw my feelings and, uhm, how was I feeling. And then, I've got to do my thoughts, uhm, in that. 

00:54:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
KATIE And then, my, ah, what, what I was doing or, and what I did. 

00:55:00
 That's brilliant. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

00:55:00
 Well done, Katie. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

00:55:00
  Remember that really well. Katie perhaps you could explain to Mom this example that we went through to give her an idea of, of what it is that we want you to do. 

00:55:10
KATIE Okay. Well, this is when you wanted me to go to school. Uhm, this is what my face look like and, (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
KATIE that's how I was, how anxious I was and I was feeling sick and dizzy. And I didn't want to go to school 'coz Mr. Jones is scary. And uhm, I thought he will shout at me and I will have, have a panic and I will fall over. (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
KATIE So, uhm, I didn't get out of bed and I wouldn't get ready. 

00:55:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:55:40
 Okay. So, that's, Katie has worked really hard at that you, as you can see. So we've got a really good idea of how she's feeling, what she did, and, and this thought bubble here as the same to Katie, it's really important, uhm, sometimes quite hard to work out what you're thinking in situation. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:55:55
 But, I've asked Katie to try really hard and have to think about what was going through ahead of the time. 'Coz this is really quite important. And we... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

00:56:00
 ...wonder if you might help her out by filling in, you know, what it was that she was doing at that time. 

00:56:05
MRS. SMITH Okay. Okay.(crosstalk) 

00:56:05
 Yeah, okay. 

00:56:10
 Katie had no problems recognizing and describing the emotions of anger and fear and the therapist's questions helped her to begin to distinguish between related thoughts, bodily feelings and behaviors. Although the diary and homework are often introduced early on in therapy, in Katie's case, the therapist waited until the self-monitoring session. It is important to set the child out to succeed with homework and so the therapist spent a lot of time expla-, explaining the task and checking that Katie knew exactly what to do. Getting Katie to explain the sheet to her mother not only gave the therapist a chance to check Katie head on (inaudible ) but it also ensured that Mrs. Smith knew about the homework and would be able to help Katie with it. Although all the children, on(ph) their lessons, often do not want their parents to be involved with homework, parental support and help is usually beneficial with the younger age group. The standard anxiety diary is usually inappropriate for children of Katie's age. The one used in the clip recalls the same information but in a more child-friendly format. Homework for few is a crucial part of the program. The next session therefore starts with Katie and the therapist looking at it together. 

00:57:20
 Well, hi, Katie, I can see you've got your sheets with you today. Can I have a look at them? Well done, properly(ph) you got filling this in. Now, let's have a look. Right, well, I can see you've, you've done really well at filling in the feelings you've had in all the different situations that you've, you've been feeling scared. So, for example, I can see in this one, you've got that you are feeling sick and dizzy, sweaty and you look breathing really fast. And, you also have to really go, on what you did in this situation is that this one, you, you ran out of the classroom and you, you went to the secretary's office. Well done for that. And lets see how you got on with the thought bubbles. How did you find that part? 

00:57:55
KATIE  Ah, that was the hard part. 

00:58:00
 Yeah. Well, let's have a look, see how you go on. So, this one you put, I didn't want to go to school. Good. And, this one you put, I felt very frightened. And, this one it looks like you had a bit more trouble with 'coz you've left that one blank. So, looks like you found this a little bit harder. Or, and why don't we have a go(ph) looking at one of those examples in a bit more details to see if we can work out a bit more the sorts of things you are thinking about. 

00:58:25
KATIE Yeah. 

00:58:25
 Why don't you have a look for and choose one of those situations for me. Perhaps, one of the ones that made you feel the most anxious and we can talk about it a bit more. 

00:58:30
KATIE  This one. 

00:58:35
 This one. Okay. So, this one, this is when you went for your dance test. Okay, tell me a bit more about that. 

00:58:40
KATIE Well, uhm, when I went for my dance test, I was at home in the morning getting ready for my dance test. 

00:58:50
 Right, it's okay. 

00:58:50
KATIE And, (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
 And(ph). 

00:58:50
KATIE And I started to feel really bad. 

00:58:55
 Okay, so, you, you know, it looks like you put down here you were feeling dizzy and sick and you got this funny feeling in your tummy. 

00:59:00
KATIE Yeah. 

00:59:00
 Okay. And you, you also write down that you, you felt really scared. 

00:59:05
KATIE I wrote them down, well, like it was gonna all wrong, and like I was gonna fail it and I was gonna end up looking just stupid. 

00:59:15
 Really, okay. I'm gonna write those things down. So, you felt that you couldn't do it, uhm, and it was all gonna go wrong, uhm, I was going to fail it, you thought, and you gonna end up looking really stupid. Okay. Now, when did, that was just some good thought there, that we've got there. Uhm, I want to see if you had any thoughts about the feelings that you were getting, the feeling dizzy and the sick. 

00:59:40
KATIE Uhm, I felt I was gonna fall down and faint. 

00:59:40
 My, okay. So what did you do? 

00:59:45
KATIE I went to lay down on the bed for a bit. 

00:59:45
 Really, okay. Well done. If you can see that we've got a really good picture of what was going on, the different fe, feelings that has(ph). So, you started thinking about your dance test that you, you were gonna fail, it was all gonna go wrong and you were gonna end up looking stupid, and that would have made the feelings in your body get a bit worse and that made you think you, you gonna fall down and faint so you went to lie down, went to bed for a bit. Okay, that's really good. Can you see that we've, we've got quite a good picture there? I wonder if, if you can carry on keeping this thought records for me between now and the next time that we meet, for each of the times that you feel scared, and perhaps too what we've done today, have a real think about ah, the thoughts that are going through your head at that time. Would that be okay? 

01:00:25
KATIE Yeah. 

01:00:25
  Brilliant. Okay. Let's ah, you know the thing I want us to do today? Do you remember those steps that we talked about the first time that you came? 

01:00:35
KATIE Yeah. 

01:00:35
 Well, I want us to start thinking about some, some ways that gonna help you start taking those steps, things that you can do to help yourself feel better in those situations. And, today, I want us to think about things you can do to help with those physical feelings of anxiety you get. You know, when you tell me it feels funny, you feel sick and start feeling dizzy. So, today we're gonna look at some ways of breathing and some ways of relaxing all the mu, muscles in your body that are gonna be able to help you. 

01:01:00
  It is important to praise the young person for any homework they do and to reinforce the parts that they have completed successfully. Katie had no problems with rating her anxiety or drawing in her bodily feelings. I found the thought bubbles more difficult. This is common, and younger people often need a lot of help to start in identifying their thoughts. The therapist also used Katie's example to highlight the spiraling link between thoughts and feelings. Commenting on how Katie's thoughts about failing the exam and looking stupid made her physical symptoms worse which in term produced additional worries about fainting and falling over. The next part of the program focuses on coping skills. 

01:01:45
ASSESSMENT EDUCATION DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS EXPOSURE 

01:01:45
 The therapist works with the child to build up a coping toolbox. A range of skills they can call upon to help them combat their anxiety. These act in a number of ways. Some work at a physical level, using relaxation techniques to counteract and reduce the effects of adrenalin, whereas others are about breaking the anxiety cycle by challenging the thoughts which trigger anxiety feelings. Although coping skills are presented as a separate phase of therapy, the therapist may choose to introduce them more flexibly. For instance, it may be beneficial to bring in breathing and relaxation while doing the program. Similarly, some skills may be taught alongside the exposure program in response to the problems a young person encounters; however, it is important to present them in terms of skills or tools which the young person can acquire and which will help her face the world feeling more resource and in control. 

01:02:40
DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS Physical relaxation and breathing Cognitive: coping thoughts & Challenging anxious thoughts Behavioural: being prepared 

01:02:40
 The therapist had started to move on to coping skills at the end of the last clip. She chose to start with the more concrete skills of relaxation and breathing. Young people often respond very well to these since they are quickly learned and often something tangible and immediate. However, their effectiveness has sometimes been questioned and they should be seen only as a small part of a much broader intervention. Although not shown here, the manual contains information on simple breathing and relaxation training. And the demonstration of breathing exercises is included in one of Andrew's sessions. The aims of challenging anxious thoughts are as follows. General aim: to challenge anxious cognitions and thus reduce levels of anxiety and subsequent avoidant response, with the younger children, to help identify coping thoughts and use them appropriately. Most younger children will be unable to benefit from the more sophisticated thought-challenging techniques described in the manual. However, through the practice of self monitoring, even quite young children start to be able to identify their thoughts and to recognize the ones that increase their anxiety levels. In the next clip, the therapist works with Katie to start building up a repertoire of positive-coping thoughts which she can use as a way of counteracting her anxious or scared wounds. 

01:04:00
 Now, Katie, you've got really good at the breathing exercises and the relaxation exercises that we've been talking about to help with the physical feelings of anxiety that you get. Today I want us to have a think about the thoughts that you get when you feel scared and have a think about that part of the anxiety cycle. So, what if we imagine for a minute, that it's your best friend, Amy, who's scared of going in to school, and she comes up to you one morning in the playground and says; listen Katie, I know this is gonna sound really stupid but, I'm really frightened about going into Mr. Jones' class, I'm, I'm really scared of him. I think he's gonna shout at me and I'm, I'm gonna get into trouble. So, what sort of things could you say to Amy to help her feel a bit better? 

01:04:40
KATIE Uhm, it'll be okay? 

01:04:40
  Yeah, that's a good one, that's a good start. What else might you be able to say to her? 

01:04:45
KATIE  Uhm, M, Mr. Jones is just a teacher and he won't shout if you're good for him and you're always good for him. 

01:05:00
 That's a brilliant thought. Well done. Anything more that you can think of that might help her? 

01:05:05
KATIE Uhm, you can do this. Uhm, you're gonna be just fine. 

01:05:10
 That is good. Well done, Katie. Now, those are really good examples of coping thoughts. Thoughts, instead of making you feel scared it will help you to feel brave and be brave, and face all sorts of situations that you find difficult. Okay, what I'd like for us to do is have a go at writing down some of those thoughts 'coz I want you to learn to be able to say those thoughts to yourself instead of the scared thoughts that you're getting at the moment. And, it can sometimes help if, to remind yourself if you write them down. So, to start of with, what could you call these thoughts? 

01:05:40
[sil.] 

01:05:40
KATIE  Ah, Katie's brave thoughts. 

01:05:45
 That's great, that's a great title. So, why don't you write that across the top of this page and then we could note down those thoughts that you came up with. 

01:05:55
[sil.] 

01:05:55
 (inaudible ) Well done. 

01:06:15
Katie's Brave Thoughts It will be OK I can do this I am going to be just fine Mr. Jones is just a teacher. He won't shout If I am good 

01:06:15
  Anxious children may feel too overwhelmed by their feelings to be able to come up with positive thoughts for themselves. The therapist helped by moving the focus away from Katie and unto her friend. Katie quickly came up with things she could say to Amy, and the therapist used these as a starting point for helping Katie compile her own list of coping thoughts. Another technique is to introduce a cartoon character and to imagine what he or she might say. The character and, of course, his or her thoughts can then be adapted by the child and called upon in difficult situations. The therapist encouraged ownship(ph) of the thoughts by getting Katie to write them down in her own words and to give them a name. She will then need a lot of practice in using them and the therapist will spend some of the sessions helping Katie and her mother to plan when, where, and how to do this. As with all her work tasks, Katie will also be asked to record how she gets on in her diary. 

01:07:15
DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS Physical: relaxation and breathing Cognitive: coping thoughts & Challenging anxious thoughts Behavioural: being prepared 

01:07:15
 The third component of the coping skills section is entitled, being prepared, and is mainly about teaching the young person to look ahead in the positive way. Anxious young people usually have no difficulty identifying the problems they may meet and this often reinforces their avoidant behavior. Being prepared helps a young person to explore the problem in a safe environment, to challenge their negative appraisals, and most importantly, to plan, and if appropriate, to practice the coping skills they can use, as such links the work on coping skills and greater to exposure and usually forms-

 - part of the preparation for exposure exercises, as demonstrated in the next clip. The aims of exposure are as follows; to teach the young person the rationale of exposure in order to encourage active participation, to work collaboratively with the young person on identifying tasks using the hierarchy, to link coping skills with exposure, to apply coping skills in real life situations, to address avoidance. The overall aim of the treatment is to help the young- 

01:08:25
Setting Up Exposure 

01:08:25
 - person face anxiety provoking situations and to cope with their feelings. So far, the focus has been on helping Katie to understand her responses and to develop a repertoire of behaviors which reduce the feelings of anxiety. However, this is mainly a guard within a safe setting. Exposure is about gradually reintroducing the young person to real situations but in small, well supported steps which minimize the sense of threat and maximize the chances of success. The aim is to break the vicious circle of distress and avoidance which characterize the anxiety cycle. Since avoidance is one of the main features of anxiety, this part of the program is often the most challenging but also the most important. It usually takes place every several sessions but the exact timing depends on how the young person reacts. Katie's progress will determine the size of each new step and also how quickly she moves up the hierarchy. Since it involves real life situations, the exposure program often needs to be negotiated with others. Before embarking on the exposure exercises, the therapist have therefore organize the meeting with the school. We join them at the start of the session following the meeting. 

01:09:35
 Katie now we've(ph) been practicing all those skills that we've been talking about, ah, ways to help... (crosstalk) 

01:09:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:09:40
 ...you be brave in, in the situations, I think, now is the time, we've come, to start and to put them into practice in those steps that we drew(ph). More early on when you first came. We had a meeting in school last week and we agreed that you're gonna start doing(ph) that on Monday. 

01:09:50
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:09:55
 So, I got the list, the ste, the steps here that we agreed. Lets have a look at what the first one was. 

01:10:00
Katies hierarchy Anxiety Rating Going into school (but not into class with Mum) 2 Going into Mrs. Peacocks class with Mum 3 Going into Mrs. Peacocks class on my own but with Mum nearby 4 Going into Mrs. Peacocks class with Mum not in school 5 Going into Mr. Jones class with Mum 8 Going into Mr. Jones class on my own 

01:10:00
 So, Katie, what we've got here is, is that you're gonna go and spend a lot way(ph) of time in school with your mom. I wonder if, if, if, if you've had any thoughts about how best to do that. 

01:10:05
MRS. SMITH  Well, I, I thought maybe if we went in a bit later, to be with children or to go into the classroom, it would be a bit quieter. 

01:10:15
 Right. Okay. So, so when were you thinking about? 

01:10:20
MRS. SMITH Well, may, say about half nine the other children in the classroom. Well that...(crosstalk) 

01:10:25
 Right. 

01:10:25
MRS. SMITH ...will it be better. 

01:10:25
 Okay. That sounds like a good idea. Katie, what do you think about that? 

01:10:30
KATIE Yeah. That would be good. 

01:10:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
 Okay. So where would you go in school? 

01:10:35
KATIE Uhm, well we could go to the Secretary's office. 

01:10:35
  Right. Okay. That sounds like a good plan. So let me write that down. So, Katie, (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:10:40
 you're gonna go into school on Monday morning with your mom about half past nine and you're gonna go to the Secretary's office. Okay. Now, there are two things that are really important for you to remember to do. The first is, do you remember that fear thermometer that we've, we've used before? 

01:10:55
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
KATIE Yeah. 

01:11:00
 Mrs. Smith, I wonder if you could get Katie to ah, check out her anxiety, uhm, while she's doing this task. So perhaps you could get her to rate how scared she's feeling just before she gets to school, once she gets there and perhaps for each five minutes while you're there. 

01:11:15
MRS. SMITH Okay. Yeah. 

01:11:15
 'Coz what's really important is that Katie stays in the situation until her anxiety comes down, and comes down to note on this scale. 

01:11:20
MRS. SMITH Okay. Let's try and keep it there. 

01:11:25
 Yes. That's right, 'coz what happened if she leaves this situation, when any of us leave a situation when we're feeling scared, pretty soon after, we feel a bit better. 

01:11:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
 It's a lot (inaudible ) we learn to feel more good about leaving situations. 

01:11:36
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:11:36
  Whereas in fact if, if Katie learns to stay in the situation, what she'll find is that her anxiety comes down and she'll then learn to feel good about actually staying. 

01:11:45
MRS. SMITH Right. 

01:11:45
  Okay. So does that make sense? 

01:11:50
MRS. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
KATIE Uhm, yeah. So, I need to stay with the secretary and moved on feeling not very scared anymore. 

01:11:55
 That's right. (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
 Brilliant, well done. And the other important thing to remember, Katie, is for you to remember to do the things that we've talked about that helped you to feel brave. Okay. What are those things? 

01:12:05
KATIE Uhm, I could do my breathing relaxation. 

01:12:10
 That's brilliant. Okay. When are you gonna do those? 

01:12:15
KATIE Uhm, when I start to get scared. 

01:12:15
 Right. Good. (crosstalk) 

01:12:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:12:20
 And what else can you do to help yourself be brave? 

01:12:20
KATIE Uhm, I can think my(ph) brave thoughts. 

01:12:25
 Okay. 

01:12:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:12:25
 You could be saying those to yourself, couldn't you, instead of your scared thoughts? Okay. That's great, Katie. Well done. And maybe your mom could help you out too. Uhm, perhaps if your mom does her best to stay calm as well, and if need be she can remind you to do those things to your exercises and to think of your brave thoughts. 

01:12:40
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
 I wonder if, if either(ph) of you can think of any problems that, that might get in the way of, of Katie achieving this first step. 

01:12:50
MRS. SMITH  I'm, I'm still worried about getting her actually to school 'coz we've had problems with that before. 

01:12:55
  Right. Okay. Uhm, and what sort of things you think you could do that might help with that? 

01:13:00
MRS. SMITH  Well, doesn't really help with her brother 'coz when he's there, he's like, like in a run telling us not to be stupid and stuff. 

01:13:15
 Right. Okay. Uhm, so do you think it might be possible to have a word with Katie's brother to, to make sure that he stays out of her way on Monday morning? 

01:13:20
MRS. SMITH Yeah, yeah, that'd be possible. I could do that. 

01:13:25
 Okay. And do you think there's anything else that you could do that might help? 

01:13:30
MRS. SMITH I don't know really. 

01:13:35
 I, I wonder if, if Katie could actually start doing her relaxation and, and thinking her brave thoughts from the very moment that she wakes up in the morning. So all the time ...(crosstalk) 

01:13:45
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:13:45
 ...she's working toward staying calm and being brave and said she doesn't get, as where it took to the point where battle(ph) start to occur. 

01:13:50
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

01:13:50
 I wonder if, if Katie might would go with that. 

01:13:55
KATIE Okay. 

01:13:55
 So you will start your exercises, the very first thing that you do when you wake up. Great. Another thing that can help uhm, is that Kathy has something to aim for, a reward to get at the end of this when she succeeds. I wonder if either of you can think of something that would be a good reward for Katie. 

01:14:10
MRS. SMITH  We, you like comics, don't you? Well, if we, if she minds(ph) to stay, then we could you get you a comic on the way home. 

01:14:20
 That sounds like a really good idea. 

01:14:20
MRS. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:14:20
 Like you say, you could perhaps go to the shop on the way home from school and Katie could choose the comic. What do you think, Katie? 

01:14:25
KATIE  I think that'd be really good. 

01:14:30
 Okay, smashing. So we've got a really cleared plan then of what's gonna happen on Monday. What Katie's gonna do, what mom's gonna do and the reward that Katie's gonna get at the end of it. Brilliant. What I'd like you to do is, is just keep some records for me of how you get only that so that we've got, ah, a note and(ph) something to think... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
MRS. SMITH Okay. 

01:14:45
 ...about next time that you come. 

01:14:50
 The exposure program- 

01:14:50
Exposure in Practice 

01:14:50
 -is based on the graded hierarchy which Katie, her mother, and the therapist identified earlier in therapy. Katie had originally rated going into school with her mother as a two. They were therefore starting with a situation which Katie perceived as (inaudible ) threatening. Her mother's presence would also be a source of extra support for Katie. Each exposure session needs to be carefully set up and planned. The therapist involved both Katie and her mother in planning exactly what was going to happen. 

01:15:20
problem solving 

01:15:20
 She also encouraged them to identify potential problems and to think of ways of minimizing them, for instance, keeping Katie's brother out of the way and going into school later than the other children. An important part of the session was getting Katie to identify the coping skill she could use. The therapist was keen that Katie's start using them well in advance and since anticipatory anxiety can result in young people never actually getting as far as the exposure situation. 

01:15:45
coping with anticipatory anxiety 

01:15:45
  A crucial part of the whole exercise is the monitoring of anxiety before, during and after the exposure. The therapist explains to Katie and her mother and also emphasized the importance of Katie staying in the si, situation until her anxiety levels had fallen. 

01:16:05
stay in situation - anxiety habituation 

01:16:05
 One of the main risks during exposure is the young person will leave the situation while still experiencing high levels of anxiety thus reinforcing the avoidant behavior. Although this cannot always be prevented, careful planning and a clear explanation of the rationale do help to reduce the risks. 

01:16:20
immediate rewards - praise 

01:16:20
 Finally, rewards can be very useful in reinforcing success. These need to be provided as soon as possible but do not need to be large or expensive. Katie was delighted with the idea of a comic. But in some situations, the therapist maybe called upon to help negotiate something which is acceptable to both parent and child. Exposure rarely progresses at a smooth pace especially as the young person moves up the hierarchy towards the more threatening situations. Katie started of very well. But we joined her a few weeks later after she has experienced to setback. 

01:16:55
MRS. SMITH Yeah. It was a complete nightmare 'coz she just, he got himself into real stay and I had to go and bring her home and then, we haven't been back to school then(ph), haven't been able to get her back into school. It's like we've just gone back to square one again. 

01:17:05
  Well, okay. Let, well, let's have a think about then. 

01:17:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:17:10
 Katie, looking at these record sheets here, it looks like on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, you did really well. It, it looks like you spent all morning in, in Mrs. Peacock's class in each of those days. 

01:17:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
 And then suddenly your mom wasn't around at all. She was at home. Is that right? 

01:17:25
KATIE Yeah. 

01:17:25
 Okay. How did you feel those, those days went Katie? 

01:17:30
KATIE Oh, I felt they went really well. 

01:17:30
  What were you doing? 

01:17:35
KATIE Uhm, I was helping some of the younger children read. 

01:17:35
 Really, okay. (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:17:35
  Well done for that. And then it sounds like on Thursday (inaudible ) didn't turned up. I think you weren't expecting her and so some of your scary thoughts and, and feelings came back. And you ended up leaving the classroom. (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:17:50
 Is that right? 

01:17:50
KATIE Yes. 

01:17:50
  Okay. But it, I mean it so, sounds still that you made some really good progress last week. It's certainly in the first part of the week. Uhm, and what you had on Thursday sounds like a bit of a setback. I'm not common in these sorts of anxiety problems. And it doesn't mean that we're back to square one. So how, how do you think we could get back on track from here? Katie, I wonder if you've got any ideas. 

01:18:15
KATIE Uhm, well, I found it easy when mom was about(ph). 

01:18:15
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:18:20
 Right. Okay. So how could we use that to get you back on track? 

01:18:20
KATIE Hmm, I don't know. (crosstalk) 

01:18:20
MRS. SMITH  Well, I could maybe take her into Mrs. Peacock's class and, and if I went to the secretary, so I'm still in school while... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:18:30
MRS. SMITH ...she was in the class. 

01:18:30
  Right. Okay. That sounds a really good idea. 

01:18:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:18:35
 Let's make a plan of exactly how we're gonna put that into practice. 

01:18:40
 When young people experience setbacks, then all, the family, may feel discouraged and quickly lose sight of the progress that has been made. The therapist was therefore keen to reassure Katie and her mother that their experience was neither unusual nor worrying. She was also keen that the exposure program should not be interrupted at this stage, otherwise, there was a risk that Katie's avoidant behavior(ph) patterns would be reinforced. However, if Katie was to continue, she needed to feel safe. The therapist's suggestion of having Katie's mother nearby was ideal, since it meant that Katie stayed at the same point on the hierarchy but with a greater level of support. Setbacks can provide useful information for the therapist, helping her to monitor progress, identify particular areas of vulnerability and plan future steps more effectively. Katie's mother has been closely involved with the therapy throughout, supporting- 

01:19:35
Working With Families 

01:19:35
 - Katie and helping her to put into practice the therapy suggestions. However, parents often need support in this role. And the next scene shows the therapist discussing some of the difficulties Katie's mother has been having. 

01:19:45
MRS. SMITH Yeah, well, she's being awful(ph), I mean if she gets so upset at school and then, and when she gets upset in the morning I get upset and then my mom starts asking her, you know, "What, what you do? Why are you feeling like that?" And she gets so upset. It's awful. 

01:20:00
 Right. I'm glad you brought that up 'coz that's a really important point. And I think it's something that happens in a lot of families where the, there's a child that's getting very anxious. 

01:20:05
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:20:10
 Uhm, you know the, the more that adults get distressed, the more the child gets worked up. And, and it all turns to make the situation worse. I mean, I mean I wonder if that ever happens in your family. 

01:20:15
MRS. SMITH  Yeah. It does and then, yeah, 'coz I get upset in a moment and I know it's not helping her, but, so I can't, I can't help it really. 

01:20:25
 Right. But do you find any thi, things that do help you to stay a little bit calm in those situations. 

01:20:30
MRS. SMITH It helps when I've got like practical things I can tell her to do, you know, like you said about the briefing, I tell her that... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
 Hmm. 

01:20:35
MRS. SMITH ...and other stuff that you've mentioned, I feel like I can do that. But then her grandma starts asking, you know, "Why, why are you getting upset?" And that doesn't, you know, that makes it worse really. 

01:20:45
  Right. Well, I think that's a good point. And then, and it's really good that you've been trying to do those things to stay calm. And I think... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
 ...you know talking Katie through some of the things we've thought about in sessions is, is a really good thing to be doing. The, the trouble with asking children why, uhm, is children Katie's age often don't know the answer to that and... (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
 ...particular in the works upon feeling anxious. It, it can be (inaudible ) question to answer for anyone. And I wonder if, if it might be better to, to leave those things to another time and the situation's different and Katie's feeling a lot calmer. 

01:21:15
MRS. SMITH Right. Yeah. 

01:21:20
 Can I just check with you? Who, who tends to get involved when, when Katie is getting very upset? 

01:21:20
MRS. SMITH  Uhm, usually, yeah, it's usually me and then my mom. Right(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:21:25
 Right. Well, the thing I'd suggest that perhaps it's only you that deals with Katie when she gets upset because the, (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:21:35
 ...the more people around him(ph), you know, might make the situation a bit worse. 

01:21:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
 Uhm, and I wonder if, if Katie's grandma might like ah, to come to one of the appointments so we can talk about that a bit more together. 

01:21:45
MRS. SMITH Yeah. Okay. 

01:21:45
 The, the other thing I wondered about was uhm, I know we've been talking a lot about Katie and going to school. 

01:21:50
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:21:55
 But I remember you, you're both talking about earlier that, that one thing Katie would like to see is to get a bit more independent again, being able to do things on her own. 

01:22:00
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. Yeah. 

01:22:00
  And I wonder if that might be a good thing fi, first to work, ah, work on that at the time as what we're doing at the moment. 

01:22:05
MRS. SMITH  Yeah 'coz I, (inaudible ) worry and my friends say I'm too over protective of her (inaudible ). 

01:22:16
 Right. Okay. 

01:22:16
MRS. SMITH Yeah. 

01:22:16
 It might be a good thing first to work on at the same time as we, we work in, on issues getting her back to school. And we could think about it in a similar way so setting a small steps uhm, to get doing small things. So for... (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
 ...example, you know, perhaps encouraging her to go to the corner shop on her own or, or... (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:22:35
 ...staying over a friend's house 'coz I think if, if uhm, Katie picks up from you that you're confident in her ability to do, to do that, I think she will feel a bit more confident in herself. 

01:22:45
 The session with Mrs. Smith highlighted two problems commonly experienced by parents. Firstly, a child's anxiety will often evoke strong feelings in a parent. And this can result in parent and child reinforcing each other's distress. Katie's mother clearly described this and her difficulties in containing the situation once emotion started to spiral. Second, parents may be reinforcing their child's avoidant behavior patterns either consciously or subconsciously. In the clip, Katie's mother recognized that she could be over protective and that her own anxieties maybe feeding into Katie's. As previously highlighted, the therapist needs to stay alert to these issues and also to approach them in a sense they have a known judgmental manner. Mrs. Smith was giving the opportunity to talk about her own feelings and difficulties although the therapist kept the focus primarily on Katie and her needs. The therapist also picked up on the need to involve other members of the family by inviting Katie's grandma to the next session. This is the last scene with Katie. However, the manual contains section on relapse prevention. And this is illustrated in the final session of Andrew's therapy later in the video.
