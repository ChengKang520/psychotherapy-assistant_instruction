NICK CARR  Ah, Mrs. Adams. 

00:00:35
MRS. ADAMS Yes? 

00:00:35
NICK CARR Do you mind if I have a word with you? 

00:00:35
MRS. ADAMS No. Of course. 

00:00:40
[sil.] 

00:00:40
NICK CARR  Mrs. Adams, I've got some bad news for you. I'm afraid that your husband has cancer. 

00:00:50
MRS. ADAMS Oh no. 

00:00:50
NICK CARR Uhm, we had an operation done on him yesterday and we're unable to remove this cancer. Uhm, we will be sending him to the Christi(ph) Hospital where they sometimes use X-ray treatment for this sort of thing. But I really wouldn't pin too much hope on it. 

00:01:05
MRS. ADAMS  Are you sure you've done all the tests? 

00:01:10
NICK CARR Oh, we're absolutely certain. There's no doubt about it, I'm afraid. Uhm, I think its important that you don't tell him, because I think it will ruin any time that he's, he's got left with us, which I think will be about six months at the absolute outside. 

00:01:25
MRS. ADAMS  Why do you sent him to Christi(ph), what for? 

00:01:30
NICK CARR  Well, sometimes X-ray treatment helps with this sort of thing, but I really wouldn't pin too much hope on it. Excuse me, Mrs. Adams. 

00:01:40
BREAKING BAD NEWS David Goldberg 

00:01:40
DAVID GOLDBERG  That's how bad news is often broken to people. It has a way of making bad news extra bad. We made this video tape because our junior doctors asked us for it. They wish they had had some help with this kind before they'd been thrown in at the deep end. During the video tape, there are going to be a number of points when a discussion point caption like the one you're seeing now, comes up on the screen. When this happens, stop the machine. And if you're viewing the videotape in a group, have a discussion among yourselves to deal with the points that have just been raised. If you're viewing the videotape by yourself, then I suggest you get yourself a scrap of paper and jot down your own replies to the points we've just raised. Now, in the interview you just saw between the doctor and the patient in the ward, how many mistakes did you think the doctor made? Stop the machine now and say,- 

00:03:15
Discussion point 

00:03:15
DAVID GOLDBERG How many mistakes they were and what each one of them was. Well, I don't know how many mistakes you counted but I could see about six. First of all, he never introduced himself. He didn't say who he was and what he did in the hospital. Second, he talked to her in public in front of another doctor so she had no privacy. Third, he talked to in rather like a casual, abrupt way, I think. Fourth, he gave her no opportunity to express her own feelings to him. They were just brushed over. Fifthly, but he gave her a prognosis when he hadn't been asked for one. And finally, by telling her to keep her husband's illness a secret from him, not telling the diagnosis, he greatly added to the burdens that she already has to bear. Well, the good news is that actually, that isn't how Mr. Carr does talk to relatives. And what he's kindly agreed to do for us now is to show us how he really would talk to Mrs. Adams. And let's just direct attention to some of the early points that arise in such an interview. First of all, he takes her to an interview room where they won't be interrupted, and he has of course introduced himself to her. Then, he tells her why he's asked her to come and see him. He tells her what the interview is going to be about, and right away, he asks her how she feels about her husband's illness. Let's just see how he does those things. 

00:05:00
NICK CARR  Ah, Mrs. Adams. My name's Mr. Carr. I'm the surgeon who operated on your husband yesterday. Do you mind if I have a word with you for a moment please? 

00:05:15
MRS. ADAMS No. Of course not. 

00:05:15
NICK CARR  Well, Mrs. Adams, we won't be disturbed in here and so I'd like to talk to you about your husband's illness. I expect you're rather worried about him, aren't you? 

00:05:30
MRS. ADAMS Yes. He's lost such a lot of weight recently and he has no energy. 

00:05:35
NICK CARR Yes. How are you managing? 

00:05:40
MRS. ADAMS Well, I supposed because of, it's because of worrying, I, I have a lot of stomach pains. 

00:05:45
NICK CARR  I'm sure, I'm sure you... (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
MRS. ADAMS And, uhm, I wake up during the night and I... (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
NICK CARR Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
MRS. ADAMS ...sort of feel a tight knot here. 

00:05:55
NICK CARR Yes. Have you seen someone about it? 

00:05:55
MRS. ADAMS No. No. 

00:06:00
NICK CARR I think, I think you must. It's a very anxious time for you. 

00:06:00
MRS. ADAMS  Yes. 

00:06:05
DAVID GOLDBERG The doctor noticed how anxious she was right at the beginning and gave her an opportunity to tell him about it. Do you remember he said, "I expect you'd be worried about him?" After he said that, he paused and gave her an opportunity to tell him about herself. There are various ways of doing that. You might say, "I'd like first of all ask you how you're feeling." A lot of surgeon that I know says to relative at this point, what do you make of him? Whatever is natural for you, use words that you'd normally use but be sure to give relatives an opportunity to talk to you about their own reactions to the illness. When you've given that opportunity, it's time to go to the main purpose of the interview which is for you to give information to them. Don't just run into that stage of the interview. Make a clear statement that you're about to give information. Lets call that an opening statement. That will indicate that you're now going to change the subject and talk about the patient's illness. Let's just watch Mr. Carr now and see how he does that. 

00:07:25
NICK CARR Well, I'd like to tell you how far we've got into looking into your husband's illness. As you know, we operated on him yesterday, and uhm, unfortunately he had a large tumor of the left lung, which was very close to some structures inside the chest and stuck to them, and which meant that we couldn't remove it. At the moment, he's back on the ward and seems to be making a satisfactory recovery. 

00:08:00
MRS. ADAMS You mean he has Cancer? 

00:08:00
NICK CARR  Yes. I'm afraid he has. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:05
MRS. ADAMS  If you couldn't take it out, would it go on spreading? 

00:08:15
NICK CARR No, not necessarily. There are other forms of treatment we can use these days. 

00:08:20
DAVID GOLDBERG  She seemed shattered, didn't she? But it's better to be shattered here in the doctor's office than to be shattered in your car on the way home. At least here, the doctor can respond to her and make some positive remarks about what can now be done to help her husband. Notice what the doctor did. When he gave her the news, her husband had cancer, he paused, he gave her an opportunity to respond to that news. She's done so and now he's talking about the treatment. Now, in this particular case, he is suggesting radiotherapy. And it's all too easy to go straight into telling relatives what the side effects of radiotherapy are. Don't do that. First of all, tell them the good news about radiotherapy, what it can do for the patient. So first, tell the uses of radiotherapy then mention the side effects, and then go on to tell the relative that it's perfectly proper that if they're worried about those side effects, they should contact the hospital. Tell them what they can do if they're concerned. Towards the end of this interview with the patient, you'll see how Mr. Carr gives her an opportunity to ask him any other questions that she has. 

00:09:50
NICK CARR There's a special type of treatment, um, X-ray treatment which your husband will go to the Christi(ph) for. And the treatment has the effect of shrinking the tumor. There are number of side effects associated with this treatment such as vomiting and generally feeling unwell. Um, and it's important that while he's having the treatment that you don't think that these symptoms are due to progression of the cancer, where in fact due to the, the side effects of the treatment. Uhm, sometimes, the doctors at the Christi(ph) also use tablet therapy, uhm, but they'd especially seen this sort of thing and they'll make a decision about whether it's necessary ah, to give this sort of treatment as well. If you're worried about the side effects of treatment then you can either see or ring up the doctors at the Christi(ph), and they will advise you with a proper treatment there. 

00:11:00
MRS. ADAMS Will he be able to come home? 

00:11:00
NICK CARR  Oh, yes, the treatment doesn't take very long, and he will be able to have it on an outpatient basis. 

00:11:10
MRS. ADAMS  How, how well or how ill would he be if he didn't have this treatment? 

00:11:15
NICK CARR  Well, I think the chances uhm, without the treatment, uhm, that he would go down hill very quickly, very quickly. 

00:11:35
[sil.] 

00:11:35
MRS. ADAMS  Can you tell me, can you tell me how long he has to live? 

00:11:40
NICK CARR  Well, that's a very difficult question to answer Mrs. Adams. Uhm, the response of different patients to the X-ray treatment is little bit unpredictable, in the sense that some patients respond very well, almost as well as they do after having had surgery. But others don't respond very well at all, and it's impossible to, to say which category of patient your husband will come into, really. 

00:12:20
MRS. ADAMS  Does, does he know? Have you told him? 

00:12:25
NICK CARR  Ah, no, I haven't told him. No. 

00:12:30
MRS. ADAMS I think he'd want to know. 

00:12:35
NICK CARR Well, I think that must be your decision. Uhm, but if you feel that he does want to know, uhm, don't, I wouldn't tell him at the moment uhm, because he's still recovering from the operation. 

00:12:50
MRS. ADAMS Yes. We've talked about this. He obviously (inaudible ) if he, oh no, about to die, and he would want to be told. 

00:13:05
NICK CARR Yes. I think that's very reasonable. But from my point of view, uhm, if he asks me if he has got cancer, then, then I'll tell him. Uhm, but if he doesn't ask me, then I must respect his right not to know, and I won't tell him. 

00:13:30
MRS. ADAMS  Perhaps, I will, not now. 

00:13:40
NICK CARR No, later, later. Are there any more questions that you'd like to ask me? 

00:13:45
MRS. ADAMS No. 

00:13:45
NICK CARR  Or is there anything else that the hospital can do for you? 

00:13:50
MRS. ADAMS  No, thank you. 

00:13:55
NICK CARR Well, we must hope that he responds well to the x-ray treatment. 

00:14:00
MRS. ADAMS Yes. Thank you very much. 

00:14:05
NICK CARR Thank you. 

00:14:05
DAVID GOLDBERG  This final part of the interview with Mrs. Adams raises a number of points. At this stage, I'd like you to concentrate on only two of them. First, what do you think of the prognosis she was given? Do you remember Mr. Carr said that some patients respond to radiotherapy as well as they respond to surgery to remove the tumor? Now, in saying that, he was erring on the bright side. Do you think he was right to do that? The second point I'd like you to discuss is that she said that she's going to tell her husband the diagnosis. And Mr. Carr has private doubts about that so he's tended to sit on the fence. Once more, if you remember, what he said was that he would only tell the diagnosis to Mr. Adams if he was asked. But he wouldn't volunteer it. Do you think that's right? Now, when the discussion point caption comes up, I'd like you to stop the machine and to discuss those two points among yourselves. Please remember there aren't right or wrong answers to those questions. But they are points that are well worth discussing. 

00:15:20
Discussion points: 1. Should he err on the bright side? 2. Should the patient be told? 

00:15:20
DAVID GOLDBERG  Well, I'll tell you what I thought about those two issues. On the first one, I think he was quite right to err on the bright side. Patients who are just about to undergo a rather unpleasant course of treatment need to have hope. Hope is very important. Without it, you can get depressed. And when you're depressed, you're unhappy and your life can be shorter. The second point though is much less clear cut. Mrs. Adams is obviously the best person to be the final judge about what she tells her husband. She knows him best. However, Mr. Carr has picked up a different impression of this man. And so he's trying to let her know that all may not be quite as straightforward as she seems to think that it is. I think he did that rather well. Now, I want you to look just at the beginning of an interview with a completely different sort of relative. His wife has just been in hospital and has had an operation and he's asked to see the surgeon. Let's just see the beginning of that interview. 

00:16:30
NICK CARR Mr. Sharpe, how do you do? My name is Mr. Carr, uhm, and I operated on your wife yesterday. What can I do for you? 

00:16:40
MR. SHARPE Well, the obvious question, I suppose, does she have cancer? Uhm, this is something that I knew was a possibility. And, uhm, I also know that you know now having performed the operation. 

00:16:50
NICK CARR  You must have been very worried about this. 

00:16:55
MR. SHARPE Well, yes, naturally. Uhm, we both were and both are, and I'd like to know. 

00:17:00
NICK CARR  How are you managing (inaudible )? 

00:17:07
MR. SHARPE Well, I'm fine. Uhm, I'm, I'm okay. I mean, I'll, I'll get by but my concern at the moment is my wife. 

00:17:10
NICK CARR  Well, in answer to your question, I'm afraid she has cancer, yes. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:20
MR. SHARPE  How serious is it? 

00:17:25
NICK CARR  Well, I performed the operation yesterday. I've removed the lump. And I've removed the breast, which is the type of treatment that we use in this establishment. And at the operation, there were no signs at all that the tumor has spread. So we've removed all the tumor. 

00:17:50
MR. SHARPE  What's the chances of it happening again? Uhm, you say there's no chance of spreading but uhm, you know, it's happened once, why shouldn't it happen again? 

00:18:00
NICK CARR  No. What I said was that, uhm, at the operation, uhm, when we examined her beforehand, there was no sign of spread then. Now sometimes, uhm, spread does occur after this sort of operation for, for this type of cancer. And. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
MR. SHARPE So we're not, we're not in the clear then. There's a possibility that she, she could get cancer again. 

00:18:30
NICK CARR Oh, there is indeed a possibility that she could get cancer again. 

00:18:35
MR. SHARPE Well, that's really what I'm asking. I mean, what's, you know, how can I, can we expect that this is going to happen again, and if so, you know, what's, what's the likelihood? 

00:18:45
NICK CARR Well, the. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
MR. SHARPE  How long can I expect my wife to live is what I'm asking. 

00:18:50
NICK CARR Well, I can't tell you how, how long she's likely to live. But what I can say is that 70 percent of women who are operated on for the type cancer that your wife had are alive and three of spread the cancer after five years. In other words, there is about 30 percent chance of the tumor either coming back or spreading to another part of the body within five years. 

00:19:35
MR. SHARPE Thirty percent, I mean that sounds, uhm, that sounds like an awful lot. I mean, 30, 30 percent chance within five years, my, my wife is gonna have cancer again. And, and then what? 

00:19:50
NICK CARR Well. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
MR. SHARPE More, more bits of her taken away? 

00:19:55
NICK CARR Not necessarily. I, I mean, we would have to face that question when we, if she got, if the tumor came back. I don't think we ought to think in those terms. 

00:20:05
MR. SHARPE Well, I'm afraid I can't help thinking on those terms. I mean, she's my wife. I, we're not old people. We, I expect as to, you know, our, both our expectations were that we would have, would have a, you know, a good sort of 40 years we have ahead of us. And now, all that's very much in doubt. You know, there's a 30 percent chance that she might be dead within five, you know, within five years. 

00:20:25
NICK CARR  No. There's a 30 percent chance that the tumor may be recurred in five years. 

00:20:30
MR. SHARPE Well, I mean. Okay. Yeah. 

00:20:35
NICK CARR And furthermore, if it does recur after that time, then there are further methods of treatment that we can offer. 

00:20:40
DAVID GOLDBERG  This interview is far from over but that's all we're going to see of it. The relative has been given honest answers to a lot of hard questions. However, you would have noticed that the doctor refused to give an answer to how long his wife had to live. You may remember he also refused to tell Mrs. Adams how long her husband had to live. What do you ought to do then? Now, when you have a discussion this time, discuss two things. First, was the doctor right with Mr. Sharpe not to tell him how long his wife had to live? And second, if he was right, is it ever right to tell anyone how long their relative has to live. 

00:21:25
Discussion points: 1. Should this relative be given a time? 2. Should we ever state a time? 

00:21:25
DAVID GOLDBERG  Well, once more, I'll give you my views so that you can compare your views with mine. I thought Mr. Carr was absolutely right not to give Mr. Sharpe an exact prognosis. He got two reasons for saying that really. The first one is that neither Mr. Carr nor anybody else knows how long Mrs. Sharpe has got to live. And it's quite foolish to pretend otherwise. The second thing follows from something I said earlier. Predictions that people are about to die can be self-fulfilling and they can bring a lot of misery to people and their family by denying any hope to them. We should be in the business of making life for what remains of it as good as it can be. Now, the other question concerned whether people should ever be given an exact prognosis. That's not really the same as whether you should ever say to people that medical and surgical treatment saying that prolonging life or curing the condition have come to an end and that we're now going to make them as comfortable as they can be. There'll often be situations where we'll tell people that. But that's not the same as giving them an exact prognosis, saying, "You've only got six weeks to live." I think that the situations in which you do that must be very rare and they're mainly concerned with important business decisions or decisions concerning the disposal of a property. Now, what I'd like you to do now is to bear with me while we look at the whole interview with Mrs. Adams again. This time, I'll not really keep interrupting though. And I'm going to put in captions to show you what Mr. Carr is remembering to do during his interview with her. 

00:23:15
NICK CARR Ah, Mrs. Adams, we won't be disturbed here. Now, I'd like to talk to you about your husband's illness. I expect you must be a little bit worried about him. 

00:23:25
Effects on relative 

00:23:25
MRS. ADAMS Yes. He, he's lost such a lot of weight recently and he has no energy. 

00:23:30
NICK CARR  How are you managing? 

00:23:35
MRS. ADAMS Well, I get a lot of stomach pains and I wake up during some night and I've got this tight feeling just here. 

00:23:45
Pauses 

00:23:45
NICK CARR  Yes. Are you seeing someone about it? 

00:23:55
MRS. ADAMS  No, I haven't, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
NICK CARR I think you must. It must be a very weary time for you. 

00:24:05
MRS. ADAMS Yes. 

00:24:05
NICK CARR  Well,- 

00:24:10
Opening statement 

00:24:10
NICK CARR I'd like to tell you how far we've got to looking into your husband's illness. As you know, we operated on him yesterday. And unfortunately, he had a tumor of the left lung which was close to some very large structures in the chest. 

00:24:30
Gives information 

00:24:30
NICK CARR And we were unable to remove it. At the moment, he is back on the ward and he seems to be making a satisfactory recovery. 

00:24:40
MRS. ADAMS  You mean he has cancer? 

00:24:45
NICK CARR Yes, I'm afraid he has. 

00:24:45
Pauses 

00:24:45
MRS. ADAMS  If you couldn't ah, take it out, if you couldn't operate on it, does it mean that it would spread? 

00:25:05
NICK CARR  No, not necessarily. There are other forms of treatment that we can use these days. We're planning to send your husband to the, the Christi(ph) Hospital for some special X-ray treatment. Uhm, the treatment has the effects- 

00:25:25
X-rays: uses 

00:25:25
NICK CARR  of shrinking tumor. There are number of side effects associated with this treatment, such as- 

00:25:35
X-rays: side-effects 

00:25:35
NICK CARR -not feeling very well and vomiting. And whilst he's having the X-ray treatment, I think it's important that you realize that these effects are due to the treatment and not due to progression of the cancer. The doctors at the Christi(ph) Hospital sometimes use tablet treatment as well. Uhm, but they're the specialists in this sort of thing. Ah, it's not always necessary, and clearly that must be their decision as to whether they use it or not. Whilst he's having the treatment, if you're worried about the side effects- 

00:26:15
What she can do 

00:26:15
NICK CARR  then you should ring or go and see the doctors in the outpatient department of the Christi(ph). 

00:26:25
MRS. ADAMS Will he be able to come home? 

00:26:25
NICK CARR Yes, the treatment doesn't take very long. And, um, I'm sure he will be able to have his as an outpatient. 

00:26:35
MRS. ADAMS  How well or, or how ill would he be if he didn't have this treatment? 

00:26:40
NICK CARR  I think that he would go downhill very quickly. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:26:55
MRS. ADAMS  I'll, I'll have to know this. How long do you think he has to live? 

00:27:05
NICK CARR Well, I can't give you a definite,- 

00:27:10
Avoid exact prognosis 

00:27:10
NICK CARR - a definite figure really.The X-ray treatment is little bit unpredictable, in the sense that some patients respond very well, almost as well as they do after surgery in fact. But other patients, I'm afraid, don't, don't respond quite as well. And it's impossible really to say which, which category your husband would come into. 

00:27:35
MRS. ADAMS  Does he. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
NICK CARR So I can't, I can't give you a definite time period at all, I'm afraid. 

00:27:45
MRS. ADAMS Does he know? Have you told him? 

00:27:50
NICK CARR No, no, I haven't. 

00:27:50
MRS. ADAMS  I think, I think he'd like to be told. 

00:27:55
NICK CARR  Well, that must be your decision. But I think if you are going to tell him, I wouldn't tell him at the moment because he's still recovering from the operation. 

00:28:10
MRS. ADAMS  Yes. I see, yes. 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:25
NICK CARR  Would you like me to tell him or do you like to tell him? 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:40
MRS. ADAMS  I don't know yet. Perhaps I will. I. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
NICK CARR  Because, because if he asks me if he has got cancer, then I shall tell him that he has. But if he doesn't ask me, then I must respect his right not to know. Are there any more questions you'd like to ask me? 

00:29:05
MRS. ADAMS  No. Thank you. 

00:29:10
NICK CARR Anything else that the hospital can do for you? 

00:29:10
MRS. ADAMS  No, thanks. 

00:29:15
NICK CARR  Well, let's hope he responds-. 

00:29:20
Expresses sympathy 

00:29:20
NICK CARR -well to the X-ray treatment. 

00:29:20
MRS. ADAMS Yes. Let's hope.
