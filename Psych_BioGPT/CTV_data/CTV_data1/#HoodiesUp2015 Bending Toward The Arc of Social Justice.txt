00:00:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM We're talking about breaking the sentence of violence, building alliances, and mobilizing resources. What is it about Hoodies Up? Now a couple of pieces, I think, that are significant before we get into our conversations. So our conversation is as smart as I'm going three phases. Dr. White and I will have some opening remarks. We will then sit down to have an interview with one of the most distinguish elders in the field of psychology and then, we wanna leave plenty of time for questions and answers which we'll try to do at about an hour of time. So I thought about over the last several weeks and months, what I might wanna say, Hoodies Up. Much of what goes misunderstood in African culture occurs because of our inability to understand symbolism. So I don't want you to necessary see in this moment hoodies as a fashion statement but rather what is the symbolic representation that the hoodie has now taken on? What does that-- what it mean for you? Maybe, your head and your ears happened to be cold one day so it is simply a place to bring you warmth in the midst of the cold. Maybe like the recording artist and poet deals got here and argued back in the '70s. It's still winter in America so the hoodie is a way for you to shield yourself from the cold policies and practices of a government in society that has and sometimes screamin' for the warmth of justice, for the conference of equality. What is the hoodie for you? And it will be important in this context to develop your own, ah, ah, description of what is hoodie represents because you have to be careful about assigning attribution to places where might not belong. Now we've all kick in hoodies as fashion statement, sweatsuit or whatever, right? But it became popular when one even occurred in America, Trayvon Martin. How is it in America that you can walk through the streets of a neighborhood? A hoodie, cellphone and some skittles. 

00:03:50
[sil.] 

00:03:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM And instead of being perceived as a little boy just kickin' it, somebody sees you as a predator. Ralph Ellison, 1952, wrote a classic text called the Invisible Man. How invisible is your blackness, you're authentic self? Within the context of just your life space that even in the midst of a cellphone or hoodie and some skittles, all you can be is a predator. And somebody drives by, they don't know you, never met you, but the one characteristics they can see is you got a hoodie on and you happened to be a young Black male. It couldn't just be a kid. It couldn't just be Skippy going to the neighborhood. Back in the day when the elders were laying it down , there was a little run that was called jump back, honey, jump back. Well, my baby home last night. Jump back, honey, jump back. Now, I had a doubt Trayvon Martin knew anything about jump back, honey, jump back. But talking to his girlfriend and I suspect he was trying to have kind of conversation that was kinda in that realm of possibility. And all of that got negated in all of that because the only thing George Zimmerman saw was a Black male that had to be a predator. Now, the characterization of Black men in that way is always a challenge because even if you thought he was a predator, you have multiple choices on which to intervene. Pick up a phone, call somebody saying, "Some stranger is going in the neighborhood. We need some help out here." Even if you thought you wanted to be bold enough to confront somebody, it might be, excuse me, "Can I inquire what you're doing in the neighborhood?" One of those two things happened, call the police, suspicious person. The police were very clear about the instruction, "Stay in your vehicle. We are on our way." But somehow that instruction was no sufficient so confrontation occurs with a gun toted, citizen cop, self-anointed, to be the guardian and protector of a community, they thought was at risk from someone he perceive to be a predator and tragedy occur. And it's always interesting in most places where you find people unable to take on, right, really understanding the victim and even to victimize. So if you just shift the focus and you look at it from a little kid's perspective who might just happen to have some street sense and I'm just on my cellphone, my hoodies up, eating my skittles, talking just kickin' and here comes someone to confront me. I can make a lot of attribution but from a young Black male in America, there are couple possibilities, yes? Maybe this is citizen's greeting council from the neighborhood coming to say welcome to the neighborhood. As Cornel West say, plausible but not persuasive. So now, I see somebody coming at me. First thing, I'm thinking as young Black male with half amount of street sense is I'm about to give what, jack. So as I'm now confronted with this individual, by this individual, in confrontation with them, I am literally now in a fight for my life. I'm about to get jack. So as the fight goes down, the young Trayvon is shot. The news and the police want to know why does Mr. Zimmerman had injuries on him. Are you kidding me? And use that as justification for taking a young boy's life so while we won't retrial that case and why grand jury refuses to indict him? What I do wanna do is then recall why that hoodie has now become the symbol for resistance? Our identification with the young boy whose life was gone to soon but to be very clear because I checked with a couple millennial before coming to Columbia, you all were dirty. They said "Doc, held me well on this." We don't necessary identify with the hoodie in the same way that folk are adapting it. They said, "Doc, do you know why Trayvon had a hoodie on? I said, not really. I said, "We, we just, you know, wear the hoodie." It happened to be raining that night and he didn't look something to cover his head so his attire then became a way to shield him from the weather. And that one element has become the symbol around which we now identify. So contextually, I want you to just keep that in your mindset as you think about putting hoodies up today because part of what we have to do is not simply adapt a hoodies up or down based upon why Trayvon had his own because the motive might not been as right, you've seen as structure. Or rather we may have to touch our own symbolic meaning to what hoodies up mean within the context of that. Do you all feeling me? So let me say good morning. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:12:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. White. 

00:12:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE All right. Thank you, Dr. Parham. And since you stood up here on this podium, I would just follow you. So how are you all doin' this morning? You are doing pretty good? As I see in North Philadelphia, you're looking good. 

00:12:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM I feel good. 

00:12:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE And, ah, Tom has spent, ah, 3 years at a, ah, University of Pennsylvania. He was Ivy League but then we brought him back to California. Now, before I get into my 11 minute remark, I wanna say a couple things. One is, there are three things I want you to accomplish during this conference and hopefully, ah, some of this in this meeting this morning. One is I want you to leave here with some ideas, some usable ideas, right. Number two is I want you to leave here with some tool. You wanna work for social change, you have to have some tools to work with, am I right or wrong? And the third thing, I want you to leave here with is an, an expansion of your network. Now you know the people you came with but what I wanna know is who else did you meet and what did you wanna talk about? And how are you going to deepen that connection? So I'm a networker and some of my former students who are now big time PhDs, sitting in the front row. One of my-- I talked to her first conference 11 years ago in LA, am I right or wrong? And what did I asked you to do during the conference? I told you to go out and meet people. She said, "Well, I'm not but a little Mexican girl. I can't go out and meet people." And I said, "What do you mean you can't go meet up?" And I said, "Hello, get to-- bend this card up." You know what I mean? Now, she had build on her own network. You know, people are common on earth but why isn't they're getting into graduate school? So three things, some ideas, some tools, an extension of your network, you're cool with that? Now, we was started out Tom by Trayvon and his hoodie and then there was this Ferguson thing last summer, then we the Eric Garner piece right here in the great city of New York as the brother say, ah, that came up here from Mississippi two generations ago. And then we have this, ah, boy in Cleveland. 

00:14:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Tamir Rice. 

00:14:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah. So boom, boom, boom and you're dead. Now what happened is we have to begin to move from reaction to action. You're with me to move from reaction to action. So every time a brother get shot, then we go to demonstrate and then talking about the White men as the devil and this and that, and we marched for about 3 weeks and it then flattens out, right? So I'm seeing none of your marks and since I've been here in New York. And then I start you all in TV. A couple months ago, you all marching and talking about the White men was the devil, the police is numb-- the devil, too, and this and that. I've seen not you all marching cuz it's too cold, right? Uh-hmm, uh-hmm? And I told Tom, "They gonna stop marching as soon as there's snow ball." Tom said, "Oh, no. They gonna go indoors, in auditorium in the Horace Mann building and march around." I said, "No, no, Tom, they ain't gonna do that." But spring is coming soon, right? So I want you all to give reorganized for the long haul. Now some of you all wants to see this movie, Summer, am I right or wrong? And I want you to remember that between the time Rosa Parks refuse to give up her seat on that bus in Montgomery and the Selma march, 10 years went by and people was working all those 10 years little by little, you know, march by march to make that voting rights staying come true, right? So you got to decide now, are you in for the long haul? Are you just gonna run around here with a sign on in a hoodie talking about you for social justice right? You're with me? So let's go from reaction to action. Now we got a bunch of people in here going to be psychologist, some is already psychologist, professor or whatever, and then we've got this younger people. They're talking about, they're gonna get their masters, a PhD or whatever, and get in the gang. Now, you have to decide, as I said yesterday, to what extent is your identity as a psychologist gonna involve social justice. You got to decide that. Nobody can decide that for you. Tom can come here and lectured till the cows come home but only you can decide whether you're going to internalize a social justice identity as a psychologist. And I'm very clear about what I mean by social justice. What I mean is we are trying to open up the access the routes, the highways to opportunity in America, in this case for Black men. We're trying to open up those access routes and to do that, we have to do two things and we'll talk about this more but those two things we have to do is number one, when we talk about opportunity, we're talking about education. We are talking about work force training. We are talking about health care, housing. I've putting this pipeline of high school or grade school to prison are causing that pipeline down. That's very clear what we're talking about, but to do that now we have reinvent, reorganize, and invent even new institutions. If the educational institution is not working, we got to reorganize it, reinvent it, ah, get it going and like I said yesterday, I believe Black boys can learn how read. Nobody is gonna convinced me till I go in my grave that they can't learn to read because I was a child psychologist at one time in my life. I tried to be like Jennifer but it didn't work out. But anyhow, when I was a child psychologist, the thing I noticed was children learned more from zero to five than they ever learned at any other 5 year period in their life. They come out of their mama's womb, they can't do nothing. We have to slap them on the back to suck a nipple. Five years later, they can run, jump, skip, recite a little old poems and everything whether they want to preschool or not. And then somehow, the learning slows down when they get into school. So there, the, the natural will to learn and the curiosity and exploration is there, right? I saw a little girl 18-months-old in the restaurant this morning. The little girl look at me and smile and gave me a high five. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. And I know that little girl can learn how to read so we may have to reinvent into school. We may have to reinvent the job training. I see people working outside building this big old buildings around here, any brother can learn how to do that. I know they can learn how to build these buildings but we have to give them the opportunity to do that. Same with healthcare, we got to reinvent the health care system so that every child from birth on till they die, gets adequate health care. Black men died 10 years younger than everybody else that's because of all the stress we're under and we don't get the proper healthcare. I'm lucky because I have health insurance from the university and I'm retired so they gave me my blood pressure medicine free, you know what I mean? And that's why I'm still here and I ain't dead, you see that, right? I got the Black male disease, you know what I mean? But we're all getting to that so we have to reinvent these institutions and we have to empower the people, teach them how to do it. Okay, empowerment of the people to reinvent the institution that control their access to opportunity. And we're gonna give you a chance to say what you got cuz I wanna hear what you wanna say and then, I'll say what I'm gonna say and learning is a two-way street. There's not-- no one-way street. I don't know everything but you all know a lot and I know some and we put that together and two and two can make five not four. Five, do you hear me? That's enough for me, Tom. 

00:20:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Sit in here. Dr. L. White. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So we wanna move now into having our interview and, and being on the space where we have, ah, someone of Dr. White's stature and caliber just a phenomenal. So I wanna start off by saying for the record that, uhm, for those of us who grow up in life, he and I grow up with there, some of the-- in single parent household. We had to rely on what I would call social father who instructed you in the ways of being-- who try to share with you things that, you know, men do. Just how they came to know what they know to live in. And me on being, ah, psychologist in a factory member and a mentor to me, he has also been a social father, ah, who continues to dispense wisdom even at this time. So I never want to, ah, forget, right, to acknowledge the fact that for all of you who said, "Parham, it's great to meet you." I tried to say, "I'm just living in the footstep of somebody who is giant." So we begin this morning, Dr. White, with this notion of Black males in academia. In 1961, you are the first Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Michigan State University. By the time you graduate, that's probably less than a handful of you in the country? What was about that experience for you that influence your trajectory to participate in this great experiment we call America? What was important about that? 

00:22:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, I think a couple of things were important, but I wanna back up, see he's interviewed me five times? So he knows the questions and so he, he used to go to process in his head and I had to pick that up. So he's starting about what influenced me and started me on this trajectory. Actually the trajectory started 11 years earlier at San Francisco State and I left high school and I thought I wanted to be a waiter and I like waiting in this table because in the summer time I got to-- on the train, you know, White folks has travelled by train and had a Black from across in the country. When I was a little boy, people travel by train, right. So my run was from Minneapolis to Seattle and I love that I served those White folk all of that food and then I got to Seattle and I got suit press and I want the sole rail charge, you know what I mean? And a hold in the wall by. One of the women was wearing no Black here and dancing and carrying on even though they weren't folks to be dance, you know, what I mean? So I thought that was the life for and let me tell you something so my mother sent me to San Francisco and that's, ah, another story but anyhow, when I got to San Francisco, I was gonna join the waiters union but they wouldn't let no Black in the waiters union at San Francisco. I couldn't believe that. I thought Black people was put on this earth to be serve in White people's food. And the man said, "No, no, no. We don't allow Blacks up in this union," Negro back then. I said, "You got to be kidding me, you know." So I couldn't get a job in those big old hotels, the Paramount, the Mark Hopkins, working down at fisherman's work. I said, "Geez, goddamn. What am I gonna do now?" You know, I-- my roof-- my opportunity route, my access has been shut down, right? Uh-hmm, you know? So then, ah, I'm looking at Sheila Henderson here. She went to Stanford and I didn't know about her career half at Stanford but she was talking about Professor Crumbaugh. It means if you keep eyes open in this world, other events take place and the doors open, am I right or wrong, unplanned, right? Yeah. You see, I left high school with a linear plan but didn't work. So anyhow, I lived in an all-Black neighborhood in San Francisco. I'm getting to your point, Tom. All Black, wall to wall, called Fillmore which I taught my student over there that we called it the More, Black to Black. I don't care how many PhD, LLB, you had, everybody Black live in Fillmore, right. So anyhow San Francisco State was 10 blocks from the More, the Fillmore, and if you're a student, you can ride a bus for nickel and there was no tuition in higher education in California at that time. Can you believe that? They have what they call an incidental fee of $14, can you believe that? And the school was 10 block from their hood. You could ride a bus or a nickel or walk. And you all heard a peer group in your site, 101A, right? Travel site 101A, you had a peer group, right? So the first kids I met live across the street was going to San Francisco State, right? And they would have little parties on the weekend. It was summer time. And if they have enough boys, I was the new boy and I didn't get to go but if they were short two boy, then they'd called me and said, "You can come at the party." So they were sophomores up there in San Francisco State and he was talking about Plato and Aries, not all of it, it can't move or something. I didn't understand, none of it but I like it, okay. The sound is good to me, right? And so they said, "Well, look here." You know, President Truman had declared a war in Korea and I didn't wanna be going over there. I, you know what I mean? I want-- didn't wanna come back home with no medal or any cash gift to my mom. No, no, I-- nobody in Korea did nothing to me and I ain't go over in there. No, no, no. So they told me, "Look here, Joe, if you come in this college, you can get a 4-year to Paramount and the work might be over there." And I didn't mind you know, left right, left right as long as there was no war, you know, didn't bother me. So I-- they took me on up there. Where? I was a weak late. They took me to some old White lady and had it numbered along but long white hair and I told her the truth. I said, "Look, I graduated from high school in Minneapolis and now I'm in San Francisco. And I'm sorry I'm a week late but I didn't know nothing about registering because when I went to school my Mama just said to September headed me toward the school and I never signed nothing. They just told me what to do." And I said, "I'm very sorry, I'm a week late." So the lady called my principal on long distance in Minneapolis and said we've got this little Negro boy sitting here, said he want, ah, education. That's all I can tell the lady. So the principal said, "Well, I don't believe he's sitting there because he told me he told me he would never go in another school," because I'm hyperactive, I can sort of still all day long and say it nothing but I can't-- I barely make it through high school because I can't just sitting there all day long. But anyhow, "Well, he's here and he says he wants an education." So the lady got me register, post some registration cards and my auntie gave me a pocketful of cashier checks. And when the lady said, "$14.50." I couldn't believe what she was telling because I went to Kent High School with my mother paid more for me to go high school and to college. Now, I'm getting your point now. So anyhow - 

00:28:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Keep on going, you all lovin' this. 

00:28:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE - anyhow, anyhow, I didn't take the freshmen site that was required till I was a sophomore cuz I was late and the class was full. But meanwhile, I started and they put me in humanities 101A, right? Now, you can tell I'm highly verbal, right? Cuz it's a small college, right? Twenty-six kids to a class and they've set us around in a circle and they gave the Iliad. And I went home and I try to read it. I said, "Well, I'm in the college now. I might have well try to do what they asked me to do." And I'm reading that goddamn story. I said, "What is this?" Well, what was that major territories name? Agamemnon or something like that wanting this tent puffed for 10 years. So the teacher was set us around in the circle and she said, "Mr. White," she looked at me, "well, what did you think of the Iliad?" I said, "Yeah, I got a lot thoughts about that Iliad." I said, "I'm gonna tell you something, a brown up going up in his tent puffed for 10 years. My grandmother would whop his ass." And then, the lady said, "Well, ah, may I call you Joe?" I said, "You can call me Joe." She said, ah, "You mean your grandmother would spike him?" I said, "No, no, whop his ass. That's what I said. Don't change my word." You know what I mean? So anyway, then everybody and his mom and the little college knew me based on what I said. So then I got through my freshman year and Psych 101A as a sophomore and I was fascinated with that subject. And there was two things that fascinated me. One was Pavlov and that dog. Pavlov won a Nobel prized behind that dog. And the teacher was showing us, they had an old film about you served the food, the dog salivate, you ring the bell while you're serving the food and then after a while you're just ring the bell and what happens? Oh, the dog salivates. I said, "Sweet, Jesus." You know what I mean? This is the way they work a game on people. They tell you over and over again, "If you buy this shampoo, you would be the prettiest girl up in this school." Then he said over and over again from the time you're 2 years old like that little 18-month-old baby. So then when you walk through mazes, there's already in your brain. Nobody had to tell you nothing. Then the same thing, they say, "Black man, don't, don't work. You got kids, they can support." And they tell that one time you're a little girl and then you grow up to be an adult and you think what a Black man. Uh-hmm. I was in Chicago the other day, where is Neil (ph)? And she's around here somewhere. I was up on the 36th floor in a big old hotel and riding down and a White lady got on that at the 24th floor and you could feel the tension on that elevator. You could feel it, you have heard a nonverbal communication. Now, she didn't know me from I. I ain't no OG, I didn't have no gun or nothing like that but she was just nervous being alone in that elevator with a Black male. So finally, I got off the elevator cuz it was causing my blood pressure to go up. But she, she had been conditioned, you know, what I mean? Uh-hmm. Then, I said, "Well, oh, Jesus Christ," you know? So I was sitting in the back of the class cuz I was like talking in high school. I was a C plus, B minus student anyway but I would sit in the back of the class write a love notes, can't they help aside or whatever. So, ah, we gonna party this weekend, three Black kids in the class and we all sitting in the back. I said, "Well, goddamn, you know what I mean? I love this psychology. You know, maybe I wanna be this." And so I start sitting in the front of the class. Anyway, long story short, then, it came 2 weeks later with Troy and I-- they've come (inaudible ) the unconscious mind and dreams, and what fascinated me was this business of the defense mechanism that you can look right at something and not see it. You can look right at something. Like I said, you'd been oppressing Black people for 400 years. "Oh, no, no, no, we haven't been oppressing Black people. I mean, we brought them from Africa here and they was eating their mom and daddy cuz they was cannibal but now, you all can work in the post office and they said, "What do you mean we're oppressing you?" I said you, you, you don't believe there's a friendship? The defense mechanism prevents you from seeing reality. We have heard there's suppression, repression. Do you ever heard of that? Uh-hmm. I said, "Well, man, this psychology boy isn't that mad." Uh-hmm. Yeah, yeah, they are the, finally, you know, the first time I had been in school that something fascinated me. Now what happens to a C plus, B minus student when they find us something that fascinates them? Oh, oh, oh. So children learn from fascination, right? Now becoming an A student is rocket science. All you have to do is go sit up in front of the class. That's number one. Number two, stay for good notes. Study your notes in between class. Number three, go to the study session with the A student. Number four, they got a library full of books and if the lady said you read this chapter about Troy then you go read four more chapters in there, uh-hmm? Uh-hmm, you go beyond what the teacher told, right? So then I will see adviser, I told him, "Look here, and you something, I think I would like to be a psychologist. That's what I want." First time in my life, I'd want to be a waiter, that didn't work so now I wanna be a psychologist. And the man told me, the honest the god, the truth. He said, "There are no Negroes in psychology hired. There was not one PhD Negro psychologist in the state of California. God is my witness. Not nary a one. Now, I heard there might be some somewhere but I hadn't seen them. And I'm a country boy." I got to see them otherwise, you jive, you just talk. So he said, there's no Negro in there. I said, "Well, goddamn." I don't what to do about that. Then, he looked at my grade, C plus B minus, and he said, "I'm gonna tell you something, something. Till you had A shot to get in graduate school, you're gonna have to make straight A's , you know, on that." I said, "Well, I can do that. I wanna do it." He said, "You came back and see me." I was a sophomore, 2 years from that. So I came back and see him. He said, well, "Goddamn, boy, you did what I told you." So then I had to do my 2 years at the army and I value mentorship now but I didn't know what it was then. So I tried to get into graduate school on my own. I was in the army. They sent-- have to send me town to Fort Sill Oklahoma to take the graduate record exam by myself cuz they didn't allow all Negroes at the University of Oklahoma but the army sent me down there. You know, the staff car and a box lunch, okay. Anyway, I applied to London Graduate School and the reason I applied it to that one was I lived in San Francisco and UC Berkeley was right across the bay so that's why I applied there. And I met the catalog requirements but I had to realize they were 400 applicants for five clinical slots. I didn't know that so I didn't get it. I didn't get one of that five not because I was a Negro, not just the law of averages. So I said, "Goddamn, what am I gonna do now?" So then, I went back. I was working at the playground cuz that's what they gave me, a part time job when I was a college student. I'm working at the playground, throwing out basketballs and one of my professors happened to drive by. The San Francisco State was a small school so he stopped his car and asked me what I was doing. I've told him, "Well, I'm back working in the playground. I did my military time and I still would like be psychologist but I don't know what to do?" He said, "Well, how many school did you apply to?" I said, "Well, one." And I can see from the way he asked me that there was more than one clinical psych program in America. I could figure that out on my own, right? So he said, "I'll tell you what we gonna do." He said, "You come on back here out of San Francisco State," cuz I did moved across town. He said, "I tell you what we gonna do. We just started a master's degree in clinical and we want you to come back in here cuz we know you and you'll get this master's and we will take care of the rest of it. You have to read between the line. What should be ma-- well, don't you be showing up with your Black faith, you let us take care of that. You just come on in here and get the master's and then, we'll work things out for you, right?" So the way I work now was President Hannah of Michigan State was trying to get more Negro graduate students and back then, progress meant wanting in each discipline, one. One in Afro, one in microbiology, one in anthropology and so on, and I got to be the one in psychology, right? So they sent the president's chief assistant out to San Francisco to interview me and my first wife and we have a little baby was 8 months old who was big time now. She was vice president of the university. The lady came out interviewed us. We had a little apartment. I bought my wife a dress on revolving charge account this year for $9 and I bought my baby a dress from the salvation army for a dollar, you're with me? So the lady was interviewing me and this and that, and taking notes and the little girl was there on her mother's lap and finally, she looked up and said, "Well, let's talk dollars and cents." I said, "Wow, wait a minute." She said, "I tell you what, you're gonna some snow tires for your car." I said, "Yeah." She said, "And you're gonna need, ah, snow suits, some boots for that baby." I said, "Yeah." I said, "Why would I need that?" She said, "Son, you're going to Michigan State University." I said, "Well, I don't mind if I do. I don't mind if I do." And they told the psych department to inter-- to admit me. The president's office said, "That Negro boy is coming." And nobody-- and they said, "Well, hey you, depressing a university." Hmm, hmm? I mean that's how I got to Michigan State and because I had to wait 4 years , two in the army and two on the master's, what did I do with those 4 years? I read psychology books, you all. I read books on statistics, you all. I read books on therapy, you all. I had to mumble they had a whole trunk for all of my books that I bought in part time, ah, book stores. You know what I mean? Used books and so forth. I figured that I ever got a chance, I was gonna be ready, yeah, right? So I asked and this is the last piece of this, my adviser was John Hurley. John Hurley was a good man but he confused numbers with reality. When I was there I show him, you know, look here you all, I got the master's degree already. So I already have analysis (inaudible ), back door analysis, and all like that. History and systems, why do I have to take that again? He said, "Well, the Negroes have trouble with higher mathematics and that didn't..." No, no, no I didn't feel oppressed. What my brain translated was not just any wrong. I mean that's what he was told but you read some and most of Negro but not this one. So they make me take those courses over and over again. So what happened when I took the same courses in the second time? Oh, man, you know what I mean, I blew to curve off the wall. I made the other students nervous. They said, "We don't want you in here in this class no more." And they said, "Well, this little Negro is a genius." I was no genius. I was just prepared. I mean, you're gonna do something, you might wanna do it right, right? So then they erased me through the program. I was 3 years. I finished my internship, dissertation, everything and then, the last part is Minister Malcolm X one of times heroes. One of those 10 graduate students was in social work. His name was Bob Little and Bob Little was Malcolm X's youngest brother. And Malcolm as you know is from Lansing, Michigan and east Lansing where the university is, is right next door, right? So Malcolm would come to east Lansing to visit his family who live there. That's where he grow up, right? Then, he would come over to the university to visit his brother and argued with us all night and I want to set the context for you, we are the talented 10. I mean we and there's other nine graduate students, the talented 10, the best Negroes in America, handpicked, you know what I mean? US public health fellows and this, and that. And Malcolm is a brother from the street. Now we are talking. He's telling me like he hold Tom Parham, Tom listened to his statement, that the White men is the devil. That's what Malcolm said and we said, "Oh, no, no, no. Ain't that bad." I mean, "Look, he, he brought me all the way here from San Francisco, put me in married student housing, you know, with my little baby and stuff, you know." White turn it on, you know what I mean, it's a whole lot bad, you know. 

00:41:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM He got you some snow tire. 

00:41:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah, they got me snow tires, snow boots, snow suit, you know what I mean? I'm going to class and this and that and Malcolm said, "Look, I'm gonna take some sign. As you as you get that PhD, you're gonna Dr. Nigger." I said, "No, no." Now you see, I'm in denial. You see what I mean about the defense mechanism? I'm refusing to see certain things now and I got back to California. After I get this PhD, I'm 28, 29 years old. I got to rent a house cuz I got two more kids and what happened when I try to rent that house? Oh, we don't allow no Negroes up in this neighborhood. I said, "What do you mean you don't allow Negroes up in here? Goddamn, I got a PhD. What we're you talking about? I'm a veteran of United States Army. What do you mean you can't rent me this house? I sue your ass, you know, what I mean?" Then I went from being nice Negro to being militant Negro in lawsuit. How bad and terror. So that's the answer to your question, Tom. 

00:42:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Dr. White, so staying on that thing as you then, you have a very versatile career. That's allowed you to be both academician, a scholar and a clinician - 

00:43:05
JOSEPH L. WHITE And politician. 

00:43:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM - as well (inaudible ), and a politician cuz you've been out on the street. So if you think about those roles, what was important about being that versatile for you? 

00:43:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE What was important about being that versatile and about that role was I had the opportunity to facilitate the development of young people. That was just important to me cuz the first clinical psychologist I ever saw of any kind, psychologist, clinical child development, was when I looked in the mirror after my doctoral (inaudible ) and I saw myself. I said, "No, no. Children need role model." In fact, I look at that mirror and I said, "Goddamn, Dr. White, you are cute little fellow, too." But that's primary narcism, don't tell nobody. But anyway, I had the opportunity to facilitate the development of young people and I was positioned so that I, I had the opportunity to be an effective changing and the two went together. 

00:44:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Interesting. 

00:44:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE And you were one of those young people that I work with. 

00:44:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM The story for whole another day. 

00:44:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah. 

00:44:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM In the context of being an African American male who's moved from Negro to Black to African American to have a PhD to be able to navigate this space, I'm reminded about the famous scholar, Cornel West, who argues that there's a duality to kind of life's energy and spirituality and that whenever you have spirituality and energy, the flip side of that is you will always have influences of unjustified suffering, unmerited pain, and undeserved trauma. The question just not happened in your life. The question is how do you sustain some movement and momentum in the phase of adversity that is there. 

00:45:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well... 

00:45:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE If you look at your life, how did you sustain that movement and momentum? 

00:45:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, I wanna go mention two people, my grandmother and Martin Luther King. I remember Martin Luther King once said, "Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive." Continue to work with the faith, it's on one of his tape recordings. "Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive." So that was Martin Luther King that I met when I was now young adult but my grandmother was storefront preacher. She never had my-- more than 20 parishioners in her storefront church but she believed in the word. She believed in the word maybe and her thing was keep the faith. "No matter what happens to you, son, in this life, you keep your faith." So that's spirituality was deeply engrained in me. Now I left that because when I went into psychology, they said, "No, we are science and we don't want god around here and spirituality. We don't believe in that stuff." So I believe them at first and lost its meaning. And I had to go back and recapture what I had learned in my childhood. 

00:46:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:46:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE Cuz psychology didn't prepare me for what it means to be a Black man in America. That wasn't their job. 

00:46:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Interesting. So if it's true, I think by all descriptions, you know, life it is that there have enlist unfairness, injustice, uhm, you know that it just permeates different corners of your life whether it's an academia, whether it's trying to go get, you know, buy a house to, you know, house your family, many things. What allowed you to just keep on keeping on in the phase of that adversity when so many other Black man are just derailed and cut off at the knees by life's adversity. 

00:47:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, I think, what's happens to many Black men that get cut off at the knees is they don't make it strongly into adulthood. So by the time I had to face the trials and errors of being a Black man in America, I already had a PhD in my back pocket and some resources. So if I lost one job, I could get another one, you know. 

00:47:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-hmm. 

00:47:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE If somebody didn't rent me a house, I could go soon. I had tools to work with. Now, if all of that had happened when I was 15, it would have taken me out. And so what happens to a lot of Black men is their dream get crushed before they get their feet planted in the adulthood. 

00:47:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So with, with, with that part of I think what the lesson we want to be able to give the audience is what is one of the best things we can do for young Black men whether it's in school, whether it's in community centers, whether it's a medical hospital or it's whatever, you've got to give them places that nurture rather differ their dream. You've got to get the places that instill hope and possibility not just, right, the things aren't somehow possible, right. Because either the color of their skin or the circumstance that come from life, poverty, et cetera. 

00:48:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah, and it's like, ah, my relationship with Tom. Now, when I meet Tom, he was 19 years old. I call him Tom (inaudible ). Now this brother was a good basketball player but he wouldn't go on to the All Star game this weekend. Now, I do that. He might not know that but he went on a plane in the NBA. He won that he was good and he had him watching lady friends, okay. Now he didn't grow up in a house with a male figure and so forth, but I am a male and I'm Black so I can talk with him straight up. I said, "Look at boy, come in, in my office. Now you put that basketball down. That's over with, all right. And get rid of somebody's women and get your own girlfriend and let's talk graduate school. You, you can go all the way." I wrote it up on my board, remember? You can go all the way and 8 years later, he was Ivy League professor and I knew it. The same, Milo(ph) is sitting back there. Milo(ph) is a 3rd year graduate. Raise your hand, Milo(ph). Yeah, Milo(ph) is a big time PhD now working at Irvine on a postdoc and he's had any other. But hey, it doesn't take long if you, you got to write human connection. Now, somebody else had told Tom that he might not believe him but I was authentic that I had been through what he was going through. 

00:49:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Absolutely, true story. You oftentimes humbly say that if you think about who young kids are, one of the central problems that they have is that question of identity. My mind was clear that there was three quarter of question everybody had to be able ask and answer. Who am I? Am I who I said I am? And am I all ought to be? Who am I is a question of identity. What is my nature, my essence, my character. So in that context when Joe White first met me, I was a college student. I was relatively bright. I mean I will do okay in class but I will just the average okay student doing all right. Yeah, we could not get into the University of California but not really accepted. Playing ball was something I love to do and you'll wrap your image as a male in America was made some way. I weren't a gangster, right, but, you know, when you go into the party, there were some of us that were dancers, and some of us that were romancers s you know, I was on the other side so. But-- so truth be told that if you really believe and I want you to, to characterized this and copy this down, I believe that each of us is a seed of divinely inspired possibility and if you nurture that seed in this proper context, it can and will grow into the fullest expression of all of this supposed to become whether your hoodie is up or not. Each of us is a seed of divinely inspired possibility. I was a seed of divinely inspired possibility but some of the environments that I have been nurtured in include my first college university that I attended while I was playing basketball when that very nurturing a support. So when I came into, right, I met Dr. White actually before I was his student because I had brothers who went to Irvine while I was at a different university cast there lonely. And it was 20 minutes away so we would come down drive down to the end. Dr. White's class, he was like the pipe, pipe where you just have the entourage coming in every week. The people would bring their cousins, brothers, sisters... 

00:51:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE And grandma. 

00:51:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM If grandma was in town, she could go and people would just come in, if there was no seats, they then said, "Well, look you got the fire code." He then say, "Look, I'm gonna move my desk. I'll come sit on the floor." And it was just like that every week in his class. I'm a student visiting and my brothers, they let me take in his class and people just sit in there. I'm just, "Wow, this is fascinating." So, I was-- I ultimately transfer. I ultimately take his class that first year I'm there and of the best thing you can do in nurturing that seed of possibility is examine the soil in which you place that seed. So I moved out of the soil that was contaminated, well, it wouldn't quite growing to a soil in which right was very nurturing. And what did that soil do, you've got to have nutrients in it like some miracle grow. You've got to put some good water in it to allow the seed to grow. You've got to be able to have, uhm, tools to cut out the weeds of social distraction. You've got to have just enough sunlight of affirmation and just enough shade of critique and if you just sit back and do all of those things, that environment will then watch to grow and you don't have a clue what people are gonna do but what you have to believe is not only the transformative possibilities of the human spirit but you have to believe that they have the capacity given to them by the ancestors and the creator and their parents to do anything they wanna do. And what he provided for me was that environment. Walking on the walkway, a true story, and it's probably around noontime cuz I guess he's coming back from lunch. So after he would have lunch every day, he would take a walk to digest his food. And we're coming this way from opposite direction, and I see him coming. I say, "Dr. White, How are you doin'?" This real respectful and I already taken his class, did pretty well. And he acts, he put his arm around me, he say, "Young man," he say, "You have too much talent. You are too smart. You've grown up playing basketball, chase some women. Come follow me." And the last person I hear say, "Come follow me," was walking on water in the bible. And he didn't quite walk on water, you know, I didn't see him but he pretty close, right? And over the course or the next right several weeks and months, he literally took me up to his office as he said and diagram my whole future upon his chart. Well, what was he doing? He was packed envisions of possibility. In that chart that he drew up, even as he said, "You go into graduate school to get a PhD." And the more he talk, the bigger my eyes get. And capability, I think one of the question. 

00:54:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE Right. 

00:54:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM I was capable but I weren't performing in a way that I needed to perform to be able to produce consistent excellence until I met him. So you all see part of him now was kind of a finish product. But understand that, it's that kind of environment. Now our story, our connection, the love we have and, and share with each other as Black men is a unique story but it did have to be unique in the spaces, in places that you occupy because the question then for you is become how do I create the same kind of nurturing environment that found someone like me, that found someone like him and allow them to rise up, right, to this places of leadership and mastery on with the spaces that they occupy. 

00:55:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE And what we're saying is if you take children, in this case Black male children, and you connect them to opportunity with a rich environmental soil, they will grow. And these young people do have dreams and I'm looking at Jennifer there, the child psychologist will tell you if you can set the stage, they will tell you what their dream is and what they need if you set the stage properly cuz we go to Akron, Ohio once a year for a Black male summit and we have children there. The youngest was nine and then I'm the oldest one, 80 something. Ah, I try to spend some time asking these boys what they want. So I remember this one 10-year-old boy said, "I'm in the fourth grade now, getting ready to go fifth grade, and I need a computer." Well, I don't know how to give that boy a computer, you just go to some middle White company and ask that you, you know, ah, good afternoon, you know, how you doin', Dr. White, how you doin'? I said, "What you do with your computer? You all change all your computer every 2 years." And he said, "It went out to warehouse." I said, "Well, can you give me one and upgrade it?" You know, give this 10-year-old boy a computer. Another boy said, "I wanna go to the Air force Academy." He was 16 and I know he has to take a test to get in there. I get him a tutor that, that's not rocket science, getting that boy a tutor, get him a congressional recommendation. I know the people in congress but these children have dreams. But we haven't been able to put enough of them in this opportunity rich environments with rich soil. But they don't come out of their mama's womb go-- wanting to go to jail. They did not come out of their mama's womb wanting to be a gangster, walking down the street with AK47. So if we can nurture that dream and provide the opportunity with the soil to make it grow. Go ahead, Tom. 

00:57:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM I'm also reminded of a piece of African wisdom, I stylized over time. It says, "Life as its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony." Let me say that again. Life as its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. It has a lot of different meanings to me but one of those is that sometime your greatest strength can also be also your greatest weakness. 

00:57:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM And sometimes your greatest weakness, your greatest strength. For me one of my greatest strength is I was bright as a young kid as was Dr. White but being bright also made me lazy cuz I didn't have to work hard to do well. I could go to class and pay attention and still do better than most kids who studied all night long. And my mama would tell me a lesson that came to them come back and be echoed by Dr. White the years later, right when I met him. She said, "Boy, you get this kind of good grades and you do not work. How brilliant would you be if you just did a little bit work?" And I'm like most of these kids. "Oh, mom. Ain't no work," but you can't use that kind of skill set in this kind of grade. I think it's gonna carry you all the way through. Life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. When you look at strengths, sometimes they become your worst nightmare but sometimes, right, your worst nightmares can become your greatest strength depending on the context that what you take. In Black Man Emerging, he wrote, facing the past, seizing the future in America. What is it that young Black kids need to do to seize their future in America? 

00:59:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE You know, I think what they need to seize their future in America is a kind of guidance when they're six, seven, nine, 10 years old that opens up new possibilities for them and guides them. And if they, don't see those new possibilities and how they can get to it, from point A to point C, D, E, and F, the streets may grab a hold of them. 

00:59:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM So they need a road map. 

00:59:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah. 

00:59:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

00:59:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE So they need a road map and somebody to actually walk them through the first part of the roadmap. You know, you can give them a road map but you got to have somebody walk them through step A, step B until that confidence internalizes and they believe that they can do it. 

01:00:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-hmm. 

01:00:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE And once that child believes they can do it and that's engrained them there. Then, their resources from internally was starting to blossom. 

01:00:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM So that sense of efficacy, the confidence - 

01:00:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE Uh-hmm. 

01:00:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM - tell me what you can navigate, those pathways, the productivity and success. 

01:00:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE And take a setback cuz it's no straight line. 

01:00:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM And take a setback. 

01:00:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE And take a setback and come on back stronger. 

01:00:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Unjustified suffering - 

01:00:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah. 

01:00:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM - unmerited pain, undeserved trauma. The question is not the step happened in your life but do you sustain some movement and momentum in the phase of that adversity is what we're talking about. 

01:00:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE And how do you become stronger in the broken places? 

01:00:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Say that again. How do you become... 

01:00:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE Becoming stronger in the broken places, all right. So you go through grief, you go through death, you go through loss, you go through a divorce, you'll lose a child that's pain but you're supposed to come out of that pain with more wisdom stronger as you was when you went in it. Put your feet on solid ground. You know, I've been through a couple deaths over the holidays and I was talking to myself and the first time I had to go through a big death in the family, it just blew me away. I could not handle it. But now that I've been through it and survived, I know what to do, you know, and then, I had the guide my nieces and nephews to two generations behind me. You know, I'm the patriarch at the family. Ah, so the goal with your patience, too. Your patience have been broken, you know, but not how do we help the patient get stronger in the broken place but that, that's your goal as psychologist to work them through to where they get their feet back on solid ground and now they are more mature and have more wisdom than they did when they went in it. You're with me and you'll be the greatest psychologist of the 21st century. You can figure that one out stronger in the broken places. It comes from Ernest Hemingway. 

01:02:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM So as we continue to recite now some of the lessons that Dr. White has imparted to me and others right over the years. Stronger in the broken place is certainly one. One of the other lesson that you imparted that is really characteristic of your own life. You started out on a linear pathway but you had to be able to improvised. You had to be able to stop, to change course, and go with different direction, right, on a different vision. So when you socialized us, when you mentored us, it was the key to my own help is always having a broad range of choices and options. Talk about choices and options, why is it important to young Black men? 

01:02:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE Because, if you're a young Black man and certainly, this is a material culture, we want things and you see no pathway to getting those things other than me and out in the streets selling dope, bubble gum, (inaudible ) kickin' ass and so forth, that's the way you go but what I wanted to do with my students was open up and my mentor is a wide range of options. Being oppressed means your absence are limited in life, limited and what I wanted to do and I think what my mother try do with me that's where I got it from was open up a wider range of options for you to exercise your freedom. And that's what I told you, that's what I want you to go to graduate school yet there were wider range and options so you can become a professor, administrator, a writer, a politician, then you got-- now you got a much wider range of options than your father have. And now you're up and have the same options for your daughter, two daughter. 

01:03:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM So what happens when I go to Penn, I'm a professor in academic, research one university so you got to have your scholarship and research, got to know how to do that. I'm also insisting that I'll come if you give me clinical appointment. So I will join appointment in the counsel center. I'm also then, because I'm (inaudible ) professor consulting around the country and then you learn how to do a couple of administrative path. So if you think about the five options, academic, research, clinical, consultant, administrative. My career over now what is 32 years, almost 33 years and so I became a PhD at 27 years of age. In that particular space, the five categories of intervention that I've had, right, in my career haven't change. The only thing that change is the percentage of time I spent in this category. So now I move from being a fulltime professor to fulltime administrator but I still teach, I still to do look clinical work, still do consultant, right. I still try to do my scholarship but I just do primary administration. But then the lesson came out of what Dr. White told which is I'm not sending you to graduate school just to be clinically you. Your job is to create a broad range of choices and options in life to be able to do that. Another lesson you told us. One of the first lesson you taught me is you cannot seek validation from the oppressor. Let me say that again. You cannot seek validation from the oppressor. Why was that an important lesson to teach someone like me and we need to teach our young Black men? 

01:05:15
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, what you need from your oppressor is a degree and that's what you need from your oppressor. They, they are the ones who sign off on you but as far as your worth as a human being, you cannot get that from your oppressor because if you were a worthwhile human being in the eyes of your oppressor, they never would have ever question you. So I can't go to the White man say, "Authenticate me and validate me as a human being." I can go and say, "I want a PhD and clinical psychology and this is the work you need to do." But your validation and your worth as a human being has to come from two sources, one from people who love you and two from inside yourself and the worst mistake I ever made growing up, I didn't understand it all. I was trying to seek validation from my oppressor and then I had to distinguish between getting a degree versus, human validation. And then I wanna back up cuz we got the graduate student sitting in this room, I want you to leave this university with your master's degree or your PhD with a package of skill, consulting, teaching, writing and the greater your skillful and you keep learning, the more options you have. And if you have a good skill pack, you'll have a great career cuz when one door closes then you just open up another one, circle back around, right? So Tom, university administrator, teacher, writer, consultant, you know what I mean and even teaches me. We have role reversal now. You know, when I got a problem, I go to him and he tell me what do to and I do it. Uh-hmm, and I will add one thing, you have to learn to work the system or the system will work you, uh-hmm. You have to learn to work with the, the system or the system will work you. I have three female children, all right. The one thing I took responsibility for was teaching them how to work the system. So my youngest child is a, I thought she was an earth scientist, ah, geologist, she told me the other day. She was a micropaleontologist whatever is that is, I don't know what that is micropaleontology or something. But anyway, she had plenty of money when she left graduate school cuz she knew how to work with systems. Then she was talking about, she was professor and they was talking tenure here and on. And what they tell you, you need to do to get a tenure to publication, uh-hmm. You hear that? You better get publish your parents right? So she was running around here, being an old professor, all their in San Francisco state, my old school and somehow that little sister got it in her mind that she wanted to go out mentoring young people in earth science. So she made up some grass and stuff, computers and stuff. She was taking this kids out in the wilderness on the weekend looking in fossils and rocks and carrying it on right(, right, mentoring out in the wood. She got it in her head she wanted to do that. So the chairman called her in on her first tenure review, ah, her 3 year mark in 7 years and told her that you're spending a little bit too much time doing this mentoring and you not publish it, right? Uh-hmm, you all? Uh-hmm. She said, "Well, my father told me I could do mentorship." Then the man said, "Your father don't work here." All right, now working the system, I help her get two $500,000 grants which total a million dollar. Now she's applying for a 24 million plan. Now she's a young assistant professor and she's sitting on a million dollars, right, to do this mentoring. And the same professor who told her not to do it, now they want a summer job, right? Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. You're sitting on a million dollars and, you know, bullshit talks and money walks or whatever they say so I teach my children how to work the system. You know what I mean, rather, rather than system work them. 

01:09:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Another one of the lessons that really dovetails into that nicely and this is important way to teach, uhm, ah, Black male as well as. You always talked about when you into any new system whether it's a new job, on the graduate school, right, new direction, always learn to assess what an environment will tolerate. Always learn to assess what an environment will tolerate. So transform and change any systems has been important so that sometime where you can beat, right, a revolutionary change that but then sometime what the system been trying to hear, what you have to do is be careful about trying to be too confrontational with system that will cut you off at the knees. So you've got to be able to be versatile enough to know how to work you system in a way. Know what it will, all right, tolerate and you assess that figure out where your allies align with it, where your alligators, stay away from them, and then navigate your way around through cuz one battle plan is sometime not gonna work everywhere you go. Couple more quick questions cuz then we wanna move to audience participation. 

01:10:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE And then we will get my break, yeah. 

01:10:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Right. You can do that. So Haki Madhubuti, he used to be known as Don Lee in Chicago, the great poet. He wrote a book years ago, it was called Black Men, quote, Obsolete, Single, Dangerous? What is about this American society whether its Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice that see as Black male and young Black males in particular as obsolete, single, or dangerous. 

01:11:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, any back up with that one back in Tom and I'm gonna come around in a circle. The last battle in America is going to be who will control the decision making. Let me repeat that. The last battle in America for the young people sitting in this room is who will control the decision making. Now if you look back in history of America, who were the decision makers in politics, in government, in higher education, in the military, and in finance? Who were the decision makers and what gender were they from. Oh, isn't that something? And now the now Black male comes on the scene from Africa wherever we came from, Spain. And we want to participate in the decision making and the people making the decision, they don't want that. Cuz we're saying no, no, no, no. You all start going in the corner, away from everybody and make a decision. We wanna be in the room when decisions are made in finance, police department, decision making in higher education, who are gonna be the decision makers. And once that males wants to maintain control. And when I first started in psychology, they said, "Well, you can't make decision cuz you don't have experience." Well, now I've had 54 years' experience. I'm older than the college president. What you gonna tell me I can't participate in decision making. Uh-hmm. So that's, that's what job on its face who is gonna make decision when you go out into community (inaudible ), university or whatever, and now, we've got all these young women in here. They wanna make decisions, too. You know, they wanna be at the table. So now, we got a whole another dimension coming up in there. So maybe we are all get together, right? Go to live more it wasn't out of them but that's part of your generation, that hand on me, but I come. 

01:13:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Our final question before we open it up. When you think about the tragedies that befall lots of Black male, it is simply tragic to look at how quickly the Black lives are taken in dispense with in just this system by-- of America. Even though there are truth be told, lots of corners of America were lots of all Black men (inaudible ), right, so we wanna give recognition to that. I wrote a piece back in the 1987 that I co-wrote with a couple for one of which was Roderick J. McDavis who was now president in Ohio University. And the piece was called Black Males An Endangered Species: Who's Really Pulling the Trigger? And it argued that clearly there are social forces and environmental circumstances that make us a population at risk. Black fold 13%of the US population, less than half of those are male, yet we are 45% of all police officer involved shooting. We are 46% of the prison population. We have, right, high drop operations in school. We're more likely to receive discipline from school rather than encouragement and support. I mean all of that statistical profile in defining a little problem was very clear about us being an endangered species. So what's also true, is that for every Eric Garner and Mike Brown, and Tamir Rice and, Oscar Grant, you know and those folk that we lose to a system. There are 10 times that men that we lose to what is the biggest killer of Black youth in America. For White youth, the biggest killer? It used to be accidents, and cardio vascular disease that rank number one and two. For Black youth, it is Black on Black homicide. What do we do, what do we invite this audience to do? A strategies that can help with some of these young men in the places and spaces they occupied to understand that they are literally shooting themselves in the foot by helping to contribute to their own destruction as young Black. 

01:15:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE Well, the anger that Black male feels in America is real and is justifiable. What happens with anger is when you're mad you don't go downtown and shoot the mayor and the police chief. The anger comes out on the people, their issue, in your house down the street, people who live in your neighborhood. So this generation coming up, sitting in this room, the anger is not gonna go away because America is not gonna change that fast. What we have to do is help these young people figure out a more constructive way to manage that anger and utilize that energy cuz anger can be energizing in a constructive way but the anger is there and it's not gonna come out going downtown and shoot the police chief, you're gonna shoot the brother lives next door over nothing. So we have to accept the fact that the anger is there and it's gonna be there but no other some constructive ways that we can use that energy that isn't destructive. 

01:17:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes, so listen to, it's so important and I think the, the anger for me is, is interesting because, you talked about defense mechanism when we first started because all that is at some point is displaced aggression and if we understand what that is I think that's important. If you look at all the young men who involved in gangs, what I want you to do is not simply look at half how the logically gang life is but rather how functional it is. Our argued yesterday in a session that there's a difference between what is functional and ultimately healthy. If you go read books, like, like Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member. If you go read books, right, they've written on the gang like crypts, all right. And I used to just get, you know, annoyed and angry of this, right? Kids adapting the colors like red and blue. Fight in all the concrete, they don't own a square inch of killing each other but you take it out to west, you take it to the Beverly Hills, take it to, right, upper east side, in Manhattan, it will get squash like a book because the system is not gonna tolerate that but as long as you contained it in this particular place, they will. But the young men somehow aren't seeing that but then I had to step back and take a look at it, right. The functional nature of what gang life provides me, the developmental needs of these young men are not any different than the average male or female in America, the problem is that they can't get those need meet in most socially constructive way. So when they sit there and get high in dope, the pain before they go out on mission, when he go out there at a mission and the OGs instructed the young Gs about how to earn their reputation. When they come back after doing some crazy drive-by and is sitting at the layer and the (inaudible ) do you see this little crazy and so, so, did you-- what are they looking at? They're looking at validation. They're looking at affirmation. They're looking at those things that did just wreck, they're looking at achievement. They're looking to how to, you know, manage the power differential and exercise some power control over their circumstances. They have to learn how to get met in a socially constructive way. So don't leave your son, we validated the gang life. We are not. That is about as pathological an anti-Black as you can find anywhere on this planet. But part of what we have to do as social scientist is to understand the functional nature of what that is. You've got to be able to pull that hoodie down enough to see that if there's a functional nature to that, our challenge in this profession is to figure out how do we help those young people to get those same needs met as Dr. White said and what's socially constructive rather than destructive way. This is the great Dr. Joe White. 

01:20:10
[sil.] 

01:20:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM What we wanna do now, we've got-- we wanna open up for Q and A so we got the 30 minutes left. So what we wanna do is everybody stand up for-- stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, right, and what we want you to do is, right, you've been sitting for how long? 

01:20:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE Hour and a half. 

01:20:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Right, hour and a half, right? Not long, right? And Joe reminds to set the average of tens of span of the human being is. 

01:20:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE Ten, right. 

01:20:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Ten minutes. Give you 10, you all, the PhD crowd, right, Dr. Write? 

01:20:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE A lot of PhD. 

01:20:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Nonetheless but you're crowd. So what we want you to do is take-- I don't-- we don't quite have 10 minutes to spare. I wanna take two minutes. I want you to stretch and we will keep a timer but we want you to go and connect somebody and Dr. Write... 

01:21:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE Somebody you don't know. Yeah. 

01:21:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Connect with somebody you don't know. You sit to next to people you really don't know. Go find somebody you don't know. Say hello, give them a hug, affirm him to do something and let's get some validation. Ready? 

01:21:20
JOSEPH L. WHITE All right, let's go. 

01:21:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Go. So who met somebody they didn't know? Who did met somebody they didn't know? Who would admit it? Right. 

01:21:30
JOSEPH L. WHITE All right. 

01:21:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Now, it's time for Dr. White and I to, ah, just take some question and, and answer from folk. So now is your time. We wanna talk back and hear from you. So we have microphones on either side here. We wanna make sure since we're being recorded that we capture, right, your thoughts. So let's go. Do you have some question? Introduced yourself, please. And we wanna make sure we keep your question short cuz we got a lot to get through. Go. 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN But first, ah, thank you for dropping some jewels on us today. And, uhm, as I was, as you were talking, I kept thinking of how was gonna form my mind a question but I think I'm just gonna say it from the heart. Given everything that's happened with Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, how can we as clinicians heal and help heal those other Black young students that I don't know many of you realize some of the psychological things just gonna go-- be going on what they've seen? 

01:22:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Part of the challenge I think is to not only get with males where they are in the street but I think the way to teach a boy to be a man is not when they're 16 but when they're six. So part of what we have to do is think about early intervention. We hear lots about that, somehow, we, we forgot to practice it. The other thing we have to do I think is able to do some family intervention. So that we have to be able to get into spaces where we begin to inform and teach some of this parents how to best contribute to the intellectual and personal growth of development of their babies. So the young Black males strolling out in the street at 10, 11 o'clock looking at such of a peer group as whole different model. I think that you wanna, right, now I wanna be careful, right, about being a 27 year old, right, the young PhD who got-- they have kids. They're trying to walk and to tell a 4-year-old who has to be kids about how they gonna raise kids and you hadn't done yet, right? That's a, that's a, that's a challenge but what you wanna do is really understand that if you want to achieve a certain thing what is your goal, parent? What is your aspiration for your child? And if you can get them to articulate that, you simply then wanna say, "I believe in your goal. I believe in your dream. I wanna support your aspiration but there are some strategies that will facilitate you getting that and some that will inhibit." And talk about the things that will facilitate and talk about the things that inhibit. Why is that important? One of the most important books that are braid on Black families in, in America, right, beyond Dr. White's Black Man Emerging, beyond Nancy Boyd-Franklin and A.J. Franklin worked, right, on Black families in American poll at hands. It's a book written by Reginald Clark in 1983, it's in my memory and Reginald Clark writes a book that talks about a very central point, uh-huh, and he said that it's not family composition but parental disposition that makes the biggest difference in educational achievement. The book was called Family Life and School Achievement: Why Poor Black Children Succeed or Fail? The answers are in that book. If you go read the book called Brothers, Sylvester Monroe came out at Cabrini-Green in Chicago that even exist anymore, right, and Peter Gould. Sylvester Monroe grow up in Cabrini-Green and there's picture on the jacket cover of, of the book with about 13 Black male standing on the top of Cabrini-Green just looking out all over Chicago. What is it that allow old folk to grow up in the same environment? And Sylvester Monroe become a Newsweek correspondent and have the brothers on the corner end up dead. What was the difference? That's where we have to go get on the answers but I think for me, it's teaching parents what other parental dispositions that will best contribute to the personal and intellectual growth and development of your children. 

01:25:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE I think we have to do two things. One is, there is hidden potential resources in the Black community that we're not u-- using. What do I mean by that? The grandmothers. Now, we grandmothers, 60, 70 years old who have been successful and live, they may not have university degrees but you don't get to be old being no folk, all right. So we had a grand, and Raymart(ph) knows about this, in Chicago where we train grandmothers to be facilitators but not only mothers but children. And some this OGs, OG if you don't know is original gangsters. This OGs will listen to their grandmother, you know what I mean? They not gonna get up in her face with an AK47, you're with me? So that we have to use some of the hidden resources. The second is I said earlier that these boys have dreams and hopes. And if we can get them in small groups and sit down with a facilitator with some of these young people like Milo(ph) and Raymart(ph), they were tough once they feel safe. And, ah, my wife and I were out in Palm Desert and I was with, ah, about 14 boys ages 13 to 16. And they, ah, close circuit TV, the things that my wife and my daughter can watch it, ah, while we were in the room. So I asked the boys two questions, how many of you all know somebody in jail? And they all raised their hand. My uncle, my older brother selling drugs, well, they knew somebody in jail. Then, I asked the second question, how many of you all wanted to go to jail? Not one boy said he wanted to go to jail. So I said then, "What do you wanna do with your life? You don't wanna go to jail. What do you wanna do?" And I was amazed what those kids talk about. "I wanna make robots. I wanna build bridges." One boy said that he rewired the computers of his whole school when he was in the sixth grade. And so there was just a flood of talent in that room but no one had ever talk to that. So they were in an after school mentorship program run by two older Black women, but they had two Black social workers as their primary mentors, males, and, ah, the, the boys I think could make it. They talk about going to college. If you go to junior college for 2 years and you transfer to UC system and then, they had it together but I listen to them. I wanted to hear from them what they wanted from life. We'll take another question. 

01:28:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Go, another question. 

01:28:05
JOSEPH L. WHITE Come upright. 

01:28:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Just feel the mics there. 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN My question is, in my learning as a clinician, I noticed that a lot of the times our intervention focuses on the person who's really being victimize in that, on the environment and while I know when I suppose to seek validation from our oppressor. I'm trying to figure out what can we do to maybe impact the psyche of the White men so that when-- because I argue that whether we're in the hoodie or suit, you know, still walking on the street at 8 o'clock at night as supposed 11 o'clock at night I could still be killed, or my brother, or my uncle could still be killed or murder-- or murdered so what can we do to impact the White men psyches so that when they see us, they see an equal. 

01:28:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE I don't know if we can change the White men psyche but we can change his behavior. So I don't care whether you love me or not but I don't want you shooting me. I know there's a difference there, you know, I, I can find love on my own. I don't wanna get some love, you know what I mean. Yeah, I, I, I ain't gonna-- but what we've been trying to do you with the last year or so is change behavior. That's what we have been trying to do. We're trying to say whether it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon or 7 o'clock at night, Sunday morning coming home from church, I don't want to be shot. That is clear as night as from day and we are working on changes in behavior. Go ahead, Tom. 

01:29:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM I would reinforce that is exactly that what we're looking forward is to change behavior. I will also say that in some respects, if we can hold the people accountable, there are different systems of accountability in America that, right, are for us and for them whoever the us and them is and so we've got to be able to hold them accountable. The third piece I would say is within the context of their particular life space. I have been very clear and I need to be clear with both of you here as well as those who will watch this on tape later on. The wave of a movement that is built on truth and righteousness is bigger than any institutional policy or practice. Let me say that again. The wave of a movement that is built on truth and righteousness is bigger than any institutional policy or practice. And those of us that are committed to this struggle are not in need of institutional permission slips to go out and do the work we know we need to do. We do not need that validation. Now, I asked the same question everybody does which is, right, why do we always analyze the victim and never analyze the victimized. Some I know, what I'm talking about to tell you but there are pockets of progress that I see when I see help because the reason the isms never changed, cuz all the people whose screaming about the isms, right, is the people who are most victimized by it, right. Black men getting shot is not new in America. The only people who scream about it is a Black community and until everybody decides that going right to join coalition and then clean up their own house is not gonna change. Sex isn't won't change just because women scream about it. It has to change because men decide we gonna clean up our house and that playing. Racism is not gonna change when Black decided, it has to change when White people decided we're gonna clean up our own house. One of the most rewarding things I've seen even on the freeways of New York to the expressways in California and all parts in between is that the coalition of folks saying hands up, I can't breathe, Black lies meant or whatever, is not just Black. And what this generation has done with the social media has brought America much the way King did face to face with his self in a mirror. And so some of those defenses are beginning to dissipate, some of those things are going on and one of the best evidence of unfolding here in brochure. Speaking exactly that happened to this point. It is from the New Center for Psychoanalysis which is in southern California. So these are all the psychoanalyst, the Freudians who have decided to create a program on February 21st of this year in Black history month. It's called Slavery's Shadow: Racism in the American Psyche and what they're gonna be examining is exactly that one. So they're gonna use right film and narrative to really talk about that issue of what is it that allows you, right, to sit comfortable while you're watching there, witness the other people's pain, right? So there are all of this things that are coming on the corner. It's Slavery's Shadow: Racism in the American Psyche and we are going with that. Okay, you had a question first then we'll go here. Go. 

01:32:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE And we'll go here. 

01:32:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. Ah, my question is, uhm, regarding women's scholars and really what our places in this process. We've been talking about male to male mentorship so I really wanna know, to see words on, you know, what us women scholars in this room could do, uhm, to facilitate the growth of our young boys. 

01:33:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM So, Dr. White mentioned during the conference that for those of us who grew up in single parent household, we were raised by our mothers but it's hard for a mother to teach a boy how to be a man so you'll oftentimes see the boys begin to do that but if life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposite since our argue and part of what to do with our boys is to how to understand both the masculine and feminine ways of being because in my Black person is both the masculine and feminine energy, right. And it's not just Parham or White who believe that even Dr. King who's birthday we just celebrated with one of the classic books in Strength to Love. In Strength to Love, he argued that the secret to be able to navigate those pathways of productivity and success is you have to have a tough mind but a tender heart. We got to able to teach our young men that so is there a role for women to play within the context of that? The answer is yes. You can still nurture the masculine side of that male but you also wanna help nurture, right, that feminine energy, right, that you know best because that is the nurturing side that Black males haven't learn how to do. That is the supportive side that they have learned how to do. That is the functional side, why is it that you can differ your dream much better than a male. I wanna be a musician so I'll go play musician even though I'm unemployed. When you'll differ your dreams because you got two kids to raise that feminine energy and those are the things that you got to be able to be able to contribute to the mindset in the last hour of those young Black male. Thank you for that question. Let's go to you. 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN When discussing with either White family members or friends about social justice issues and you're react to do with, ah, defensiveness, with resistance, ignorance is thought to be your perspective when you're merely talking about greater social justice whether its Black people in America, Palestinians, how would you recommend to, ah, to confront this, this entrenched resistance of people who are superficially very inclusive to people who they do identified with? Thank you. 

01:35:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Interesting question. Uhm, the older I get, the more in touch with my kind of spirit and spiritual energy. I'm not talking to religiosity here even though that's a very important part of my life but I'm talking about the core of my energy. And I know that the reservoir of energy is so big so I have to decide on how I wanna use it in it so I'm less committed to wanting to spin the time to break down a person's defenses for someone who has the psyche so well defended that they're just in denial about the realities of life in America. But what's clear about that and I'm-- I've learned this from the experience and lots of folk who known about the coalitions that we've built that are multicultural, right can bear with us to this. There are enough allies in the White community. There are enough allies of Palestinian in the Jewish community. There are enough allies right for women in male community that you can actually spend less time with the alligator and more time with the allies to be able to do that so where I devote my time is by connecting to the allies in the White community. What's true, the hood wearing cartoon clan member type, redneck, this dog out racist, you know, folk are relatively small. Five percent may be in there by this inconvenient as a (inaudible ). What I worry about is not them cuz I don't playing on changing their psyche nor do I think that psyche can be change even though I think we can hold them accountable. What I wanna appeal to other ones who sit in silence, who know that it's wrong, but they are so in need of validation from that little 5% of their community that they sit in silence and no, like that. But I want them to be able to be in this place to say, "This is shit. Don't go no more in our community." And that's what you see rising up around America right now. That's the side I wanna appeal to. 

01:37:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah, let me respond, ah, every psychologist in this room has a package of communication skills. We know reflection, listening, clarification, summarization, or whatever and, ah, I think that when we're talking with people family members whatever people we know, we should back up a little from confrontation and kinda hear them out, hear their story. What are they really talking about, what are they concerned about? And there may come a point that in that dialogue that I will call for lack of a better word or the teachable moment. 

01:38:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-hmm. 

01:38:05
JOSEPH L. WHITE Now sometimes, I have been too quick to engage in confrontation. I have to admit that. My, ah, ah, daughters have more people skills than I do. Ah, so I remember being in this group and I was actually sitting on the outside in the circle, one of my student was running the group who is a PhD now and this man was talking about affirmative action. Do you ever heard of affirmative action? And he was a man about my-- it's a White guy, a successful guy and he was worried that his grandson would not be able to get into a good law school because some unqualified, quote, unquote, Black kid get admitted ahead of him so that was his thing. So I jumped up and not confronted the man, I've stepped in the circle, I had (inaudible ) in there but I, I took somebody's seat to get out the way I would call. So I said, "Look, I'm gonna tell you something, hold me." I do not know in my life that I've been in higher education all my life. I do not know of a 4.0 White boy who didn't get into a good law school. I haven't seen it and I hear on TV that somebody crying, "Oh, my little Jonny didn't get in because a B minus Black kid got in ahead him." Now, I, I haven't seen that. I heard about it but I haven't seen it and I told him, I'm gonna tell you something on. We got a brand-new law school just open in Irvine, that's about 6 years ago and I'm gonna tell what we're next in rank now. I will get your grandson into law school. I, I get them in there so you won't have to be worrying about that so then he got very upset and try to pull back, so then I felt bad and I had his card and I call them up and he flew out to California on some business and we set by the beach. Newport beach, we sat on the pier, two American boys, one Black, on White and talked about our lives. And it was like we live in similar America but in two different Americas but see I-- when I confronted him, I should have back up a little bit and let him speak his piece, you know, and so I have to be careful about that because sometimes by my behavior, I'm contributing to the problem rather than solving, am I making sense? So I think one of our great skills is our communication skills as psychologist and rather than (inaudible ) somebody over. Just hear him out and wait for the teachable moment. 

01:40:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM All behavior is functional. 

01:40:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah. 

01:40:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM See, we don't understand what the behavior gets them but if we have a better understanding of that maybe we can help them to be a little more possibly constructive in it. 

01:40:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE We'll get you in a minute Bryan. 

01:40:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM If we got time for two more question so we got to be quick. You get one here and one here. Go. 

01:40:50
UNKNOWN I would like to ask you both two quick question and they're related. Uhm, one of them relates to the fact that we're in the 21st century, social media is a fantastic thing, the internet is a fantastic resource, uhm, but it can also be a very oppressive place. The internet is where I have seen, ah, I'm a very active member in a virtual community that also organizes in person as well and there are many people of color there, there are a lot of Black people, there a lot of people who were Hispanic, people who were Asian, it's, ah, worldwide international community of people and I've never seen as many racial slurs, as many racial indignities, as many hurtful comment, ah, ah, as anywhere else than I have there and, uhm, to the point where I've left that community. 

01:41:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-hmm. 

01:41:40
UNKNOWN Now, there are people there who do think that what was being said is wrong, to think that having photographs of, uhm, my name-- or my picture and putting watermelon next to it, piece of chicken, or a racial slurs, uhm, with o-- with other Black individuals along who were also support me, uhm, for posting those images on our blogs and our network, how do we-- how, how do I interact with the Black people who don't see a problem with that? I tell them this is wrong. I'm going to stand for this. I'm going to leave actually because this is not changing and I can't get support from my own people basically. Like, like I don't know what do about that and that is using the internet which is a great resource but it's also the anonymity involved with is allows the people to say things that it would say endue in person. 

01:42:35
JOSEPH L. WHITE Go ahead, Tom. 

01:42:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM So in that case, one of the reason why stay off of social media, right, ah, is exactly that but also, you know, from old school, I got it wrapped to uphold so I can't be hanging out on social media and other places but in a real sense, uhm, what's true about social media is that there are choice points there and you have a choice to participate and the choice to participate is if I like the conversation, if I appreciate the narrative, if I can learn something and there are some teachable moments in, in cyberspace, then of course, so that mean go and do that. But if it isn't and the system is set up in the way the people have a anonymity, it's like the little small man or woman who's, right, very mild and meek and get behind the motor vehicle and then just gets (inaudible ), right, in the car. And people do some stuff driving the car that they would never do in person just because it involve them and that's what social media does the fault. So the only thing you'd have to do, you cannot control other people's behavior, right. You, you-- I, I-- we consult Dr. White now all over this country to teach us psychology, training corporate folk everywhere. And people always wondered about how things are going on my constant refrain is may not control eight out of 10 factors in this equator but I'll be done if I control at least two of them. The two you control is whether or not you wanna participate with imprudence so if you say how do I control the Black people, you don't. Black people don't all think the same. All White people don't think the same. All right, none of us all think the same. Everybody has individual thoughts and opinions whatever which we ought to have. Just stop participating. What I'm trying to teach young people is that cyber ink is permanent and soon as you put the message out there, it is all in the blogosphere. I ran the campaign through my office at University of California, Irvine four or 5 years ago, on exactly that cyber ink is permanent trying to teach this generation that what you say, right, is ha-- has a permanent ink and permanent consequence but the only way you can control that is to decide not to participate, right, then you don't know. 

01:44:45
UNKNOWN So as we talk about balances and idea of, of how far can we push, maybe think about what's functional isn't healthy. In short terms, that's called survival. For a lot of our men of color that's survival, a short term. Then we talk about liberating the shackles of the mind, that's long term. How do I work with this very two opposing forces when I feel we're running out of time cuz we're losing way to many men of colors as it is right now but understanding that, the environment didn't change. So do we liberate their mind while the environment is not changed in that survival? And I feel like finding a hard time to bring in those two things together and feeling like I'm running out of time cuz by now we're losing people out there. 

01:45:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE Yeah, you're running out of time but, Bryan, you start (inaudible ) and I was in (inaudible ) the other day Fresno city college, oldest GC in California and what I saw there was about 70% of the student body was Black in Chicago, more females than males, of course, so what I'm saying is let us start now where we are. You're in San Jose and you live also in the bay area. There a lot of young brothers who have it to 17 and 18 and they're kinda still on their feet. They maybe a little shaky but they have made it that far. Now let's work with that population because you're young enough to reach out to them and then, maybe as we work with them we can work with some of their brothers and uncles, and so forth who were the OGs of this and that but kinda we start where we are. You know, we've got some 17 year old who have kinda landed on their feet, let's keep and boost it up to the next level and let's go on from there. 

01:46:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM One of the other things I think is important to remember right in the context is I love the fact that you have restless soul. Yeah, it was more people have a restless soul for a change, right because we can simply just not need a permission that can go about doing that but understand that as graduate student as other student, the graduate school is not a democracy, hear me well on that one. It is not a democracy. 

01:46:50
JOSEPH L. WHITE No, it ain't. 

01:46:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Right, so the reason Dr. White and I can stand up here and do what we do now and do it pretty comfortably is because we we're able to navigate the system and not get ourself cut off at the knees in trying to do it. Always learn to assess what an environment will tolerate first, all right. Then, figure out how much I can push and if I can push then you shut it down or try to do because you don't want to derail yourself from the goal which to get your credentials, get access to those portals of opportunity and be able to bust into some of those doors. I would also say lastly to you, Bryan, that within the context of struggle, it is important for all of us to not simply look at the snapshot but look at the videotapes. Do you hear me? I didn't hear no snaps on that, right? All right. The snapshot is what you see in the immediate moment. If take a look at the videotape, right, it is much easier I think to see progress, right. It did much like the stock market, it goes up and down, up and down, and sometime it will go down far but if you take a look at the slope, right, in much like we do when we do our statistical analysis, you wanna look at the slope here. The slope I see in America still go on this way, right and so look at the video tape not just the snapshot and that to me is what give us hope. Now, Dr. White and I have a ritual that we like a closing but before we close, we have to also do kind of TC ritual as well. So the name of this conference we titled was what? Hoodies Up, so hoodies up. Now, hear me well on this and those who weren't in hoodies today, I want you to just symbolically put your hoodie up, right. Put your hoodie up. Now, as I mention to you the, the challenge of this hoodies is the symbolic nature of what this represents from folk is that it is now tied toward the tragic death of a young child. But what a hoodie also does, right, is it not only protects you from the elements as it was doing with young Trayvon that day but it also was a way to camouflage yourself, right, so that the outer world can't see you. I can't see you. And you can choose to be like that old R&B song by the Whispers that say that think like I got to do wrong before they notice me. When Americas image is only come from television and the media, you can't be but one of three things as the young Black male. I'm gonna either be an athlete, an entertainer or criminal. And what's follow a Trayvon in that housing complex was following me and Dr. White in the shopping mall even if we could buy anything and they're 10 times over not blink is they don't see that's Dr. White who got more degrees, and letters, and awards behind those name than most people have fingers and toes combined, all they see is a Black man. And what they see is camouflage. So for me this hoodie at some point represent a level of camouflage. Well, I flew out here, this year to the Winter Roundtable to ask a question and I didn't planned to ask a question with a hoodie on but a hoodie off. So my question is, do you see me? Who's prepare to stand up and asked that question to say, "Do you see me?" Let me some hand. Who wants to stand up? Stand up for me. What do you wanna say? 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN I want you all to see me. 

01:50:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM See me. What do you wanna say?

01:51:35
UNKNOWN See me. 

01:51:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Anybody else. We want to say, "See me." I see you brother. What I want us to be able to do is to use them as a fashion statement, fine, but as a symbol of our authenticity, uh-uh. I want the hoodies down. I want you to be able to stand up and ask the question do you see me? Cuz I'm here to declare that is my authentic self not camouflage by the distorted elements your own psyching brain but me and all the magnificence that I represent because I am one of those seeds of divinely inspired possibility. You wanna nurture me in a supportive context good, if you're not then get out of my way cuz I'm on the way committed to be myself. 

01:52:40
[sil.] 

01:52:45
JOSEPH L. WHITE All right, keep standing, we're gonna close that out with a little call response but I wanna thank the people that they call them TC, right here, they're sitting in the front row. TC, you know, I love TC, you know, Teacher's College and partly history of American psychology was, ah, written here right at TC, ah, Mr. (inaudible ) and others. But I want everybody in the room to join hands. Let's all join hands together. Let's all join hands together. Now we're gonna do the call responsible a bit like we did yesterday. Let's all join hands together across the aisle and you'll pick it up as lay it down. They say as we used to say down in Mississippi back in the day, they say that freedom is a constant struggle. Freedom is a constant struggle how long not long. How long?

01:55:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Now ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Joe White. 

01:55:10
JOSEPH L. WHITE Another going to send it out. 

01:55:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM You all must have like this, huh? So another point of privilege before we start drifting to our next session. I have been a member of this Roundtable family, extended family for-- since 1983 what is now 32 years from the first time Sandra Johnson called me up as the young faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. And why it is Roundtable? Because the cultural stability in the world of psychology is so pronounce that if you didn't have Joe White like I have or someone else, a Derald Sue, a Patricia Arrendondo, a Michael D'Andrea, Judy Daniels, a Allen Ivey at UMass. If you didn't have those folk in your life then it was a cantor what Wade Nobles call trying to be a saltwater fish in a fresh water world. We needed to find a space to shake some salt and what does Roundtable has done over the years has given us, right, a safe space to come and rigorously interrogate issues and debate and just learn and grow and develop and plant those seeds that have now been nurtured in this intellectual soil that have not only produce great ideas but help to really foster all of you because you now know of all the places in America, you can go, you can always come back to the Roundtable, right, and know that this is a space where you will be welcome anytime. Yes? 

01:57:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:57:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Some might that what I'm talking about yes. 

01:57:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:57:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM So we wanna give a little credit out for Sam Johnson and say thank you, Sam, right, for the idea. Wanna give a shout out, wanna give a shout out to Dr. Robert Carter who held down the Roundtable, right, after Sam for lots of years. Wanna give a shout out for my sister, Madonna Constantine, who held it down after Dr. Carter, right. I miss her. Wherever she is, we wanna give a shout out and give her some love but even as that crisis occur, the Roundtable at some point was in danger, ah, well, we have it or not but we've had exactly the right leadership at exactly the right time. And this Roundtable is now being carried on the shoulder, right, of my friend and colleague, Dr. Marie Miville, right. So Marie, we'd like you to come up to the stage if you will. Give it up Marie Miville. 

01:58:25
JOSEPH L. WHITE Give it up, man. Give it up for her. 

01:58:35
[sil.] 

01:58:40
JOSEPH L. WHITE Give it up, baby. Give it up. All right. 

01:58:45
[sil.] 

01:58:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM So there are lots of us, young students, the participants, and around and everybody who just say thank you, right, for all that you have done and we've got just a couple of token, right, of appreciation so number one, Mariel(ph), right. We like to provide you, right, with that vase to say thank you and of course, on Valentine Days, right? You couldn't have a vase, right, without some what? 

01:59:20
UNKNOWN Flower. 

01:59:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Without some flowers so, right. It is oftentimes so difficult to manage this and, and Dr. Marie Miville, I think, understands that the work, right, and the success of this Roundtable is really produced by the people who work with and for her as well so we wanna make sure we give it up for all the students and all the folk, just whole team, right, who was been involve in, in putting this together, with all the team folk, raise your hand. Where we at? 

01:59:55
JOSEPH L. WHITE Hurry up, hurry up. 

01:59:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Say thank you to all of them, right. And we're always very good about sometime wanting and complaining about what will just that didn't go right, or somebody forgot this, you misspell my name, right? Yes, we were about that little small step but rarely do we take the opportunity that we should in every conference to really thank the people who create this safe intellectual space and keep this tradition on, right. That's really important. The great (inaudible ) remind us that each generation out of relative obscurity must reach out and seek to fulfill its legacy or betray it. Oh, you did not hear me. Each generation has an opportunity to fulfill its legacy or betray it. I simply wanna declare boldly today that between Sam Johnson, Robert Carter, Madonna Constantine, and now Dr. Marie Miville that each of these individuals continue to fulfill rather than betray a legacy that the ancestor we celebrate laid out for us. In fulfillment that legacy, I wanna say thank you. Give it up Dr. Marie Miville.
