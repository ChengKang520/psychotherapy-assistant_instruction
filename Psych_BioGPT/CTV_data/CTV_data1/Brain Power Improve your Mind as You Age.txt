RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon. I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm host for this series on neuroscience in action. So, through this series we've been investigating the next phase in our field's attempt to integrate an understanding of the brain into our practices and we've been looking at once we've mastered the polysyllabic vocabulary of brain science, how does brain science actually influence clinical practice? And presumably, also, how can it help us become more creative and more highly functioning. And we're very fortunate today that somebody who for the last 35 years has been focused very much on that question, our guest today is a lecturer, juggler, marshal artist, Alexander teacher. many other skills. He's chronicled the life of remarkable people like Leonardo Da Vinci to teach us how to learn lessons from the lives of the exemplars such as. So it's my great pleasure to welcome to us, with us today, Michael Gelb. Michael, welcome. 

00:01:25
MICHAEL GELB Thank you very much. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON So, Michael, let's get into it. So you, my life was very much changed by the work of someone who's figured very prominently in your life, Tony Buzan. As a graduate student, I read a book of his called, Use Both Sides of Your Brain; Learned Mind Mapping, and suddenly a whole bunch of possibilities opened up for me that hadn't been possibilities for me before about how to do basically what I do here today, 35 years later. I know your interest in the brain dates back to your association to Tony, maybe that precedes it. Tell us a little bit about how you first got interested in the brain and understanding how to become more effective and more creative. 

00:02:10
MICHAEL GELB Well, it was a fundamental quest that really began when I was about 12 or 13 years old going through, going through the kind of classic beginning of adolescence existential crisis. And I think most kids, at some point, lie in bed at night and ask why are we here? What if we weren't created? What if there was no planet? What if there was not solar system? Contemplating the void and what usually happens then is the hormones kick in, you focus on girls or boys respectively and you don't think about these great existential questions again until you're on your deathbed. 

00:03:00
RICH SIMON Okay. The big E's. Go. 

00:03:05
MICHAEL GELB So, I mean the hormones kicked in and I was totally focused on my amorous adventures from the age of 12 onward but apparently, there was just a fair amount of bandwidth still available to continue contemplating those questions and I really wanted answers. So I read Viktor Frankl's book, Man's Search for Meaning and I read Rollo May's book right around the same time and I read Maslow. And I also read Jung. I read Memories, Dreams, Reflections and from that reading I got a sense that there was a path towards understanding the self. Towards understanding the mind that was the key to being able to sleep better at night when I contemplated those sorts of questions. At the same time my mom had gone back to school after going to therapy and taking our whole family to therapy. My mom went back to school, went all the way up to her PHD dissertation and became a therapist at Passaic County Mental Health Clinic. And, where she worked with psychopaths, sociopaths, murderers but as she explains it, raising my brothers and I made that a piece of cake. So, I also had this very practical kind of therapeutic orientation. How do we adapt and adjust and evolve and grow and learn and my focus was always ore on the, I always thought, gee psychology seems to be mostly about dealing with psychosis and neurosis and that's fascinating but I'm really interested in fulfillment, in self-actualization, in individuation, in creativity. Rowlo, May wrote this great book called The Courage to Create and I thought these were the things that inspired me. So I went to Clark University and I went there because it's the place where Freud and Jung first came when they came to the United States. There's a really cool statue, right, of Freud there. 

00:05:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) And there's statues, yeah. Yeah. 

00:05:25
MICHAEL GELB And I did a double major in psychology and philosophy but, as much as I was fascinated by my studies in psychology and philosophy, I felt that they were, obviously, rather academic and that there wasn't necessarily a connection between the wisdom that was being dispensed and the way I saw my professors actually manifest in their lives. You know the way they just seemed neurotic and miserable and I thought, what's wrong with this picture? So that lead me on a quest. I went off to England and I studied with a great teacher named J.G. Bennett who had studied the world's traditions of personal growth, self-development, spirituality and got a tremendous insight. I learned meditation. I spent months with a Cambodian Buddhist monk. It was really quite an extraordinary experience to have when you are 20, 21 years old. But then I said, well okay, what am I gonna actually do in the world? And I thought of getting my PHD in clinical psychology but this was before the days where they had the programs in positive psychology and the things that I was interested in. And I didn't want to spend the next seven years studying neurosis and psychosis so I found my way to the Alexander Technique, which is a method of developing body mind coordination and stage presence. It's what they teach at the Julliard School at the Royal Academy of Drama and Music. I thought this is a practical means of self development that will be therapeutic for me to study but also I believe it will be therapeutic and I felt pretty good chance that I would first, do no harm to anybody else through the application of the Alexander Technique. So I went for a three year training program in London and Tony Buzan was taking Alexander lessons with my teacher. He came to our school when the original book that you read first came out in its British edition. It was called, Use Your Head, in England and then it became Use Both Sides of Your Brain in the States. And it had literally just came out. He came and talked to us and I went to the principal of the school right after the lecture. I said, this is brilliant. This is, I need to learn this. Would you please introduce me to Mr. Buzan. And the principal of the school said, well it's funny that you should say that because Tony came to me and said, who was that American fella who was asking all those incisive questions? I really want to meet him. So that began a collaboration that continues to this day. I just had dinner with Tony in London. 

00:08:20
RICH SIMON How old is he now? 

00:08:25
MICHAEL GELB He's 70. 

00:08:25
RICH SIMON Okay. My god. He got an early start didn't he. So, let's just pause for a second here. So give people a flavor cause this, seems to me this was really groundbreaking. A practical flavor. What is it and what was relevant then and all of these things are still relevant as far as I can tell. There haven't been advances that have gone very much beyond what Tony originally created back in the 70's. So, for our audience, what are the practical tools that were so intriguing to you as a young man trying to find this integration between abstract knowledge and an understanding of how to live one's life that are still relevant to therapists today? 

00:09:10
MICHAEL GELB Well the most profound one, I think Buzan's greatest contribution besides being a champion of neuroplasticity before it was called neuroplasticity, before the preponderance of evidence was such that neuroscientists had to make up a new word to express what they had discovered and now agreed as well as the other new word, which I love, which is neurogenesis. Neuroscientists don't make up new words lightly but Buzan was a prophet of these things in a very practical way and yes, I mean, he taught me speed reading, which I then went on to teach. He taught me how to develop my memory, which I went on to teach but his greatest contribution of course is the development of mind mapping. And what mind mapping allows us to do is generate more ideas in less time and connect the big picture Gestalt orientation of the mind with the linear detailed... 

00:10:15
RICH SIMON I begin my day every day. This is a day's mind map. Not as flamboyant and creative as some but it's an incredible tool. So stay with the mind map for a moment. Just tell us what makes that so remarkable. 

00:10:30
MICHAEL GELB Well, people tend, even though we've moved beyond the simple metaphor of the left and right hemisphere of the cerebral cortex as a way of identifying people, it's still useful language to talk about. Two tendencies which are pretty easy to identify. If we take the simplest level, many people are detail focused. They're linear in their orientation. They like lists. They like top down hierarchical thinking and a lot of other people are really disorganized. They like to call themselves creative but it isn't necessarily creative if you're more nonlinear and just move from one thing to another without a sense of order or organization. And people who are more non-linear find mind mapping allows them to bring order to their imagination. That it respects the free flowing spontaneous nature of their thought but it helps them bring it into usefulness, into order so that they can actually implement all their wonderful ideas and prioritize them. Now, people who are more linear and, I tease my clients, cause I work with these kinds of people. This is my largest audience. They're engineers and scientists from big companies. And I tell them, look I'm gonna give you your diagnosis. I tell them, you suffer from premature organization. And I explain to them that premature organization prevents conception. Mind mapping liberates these people from premature organization. It liberates them from the creativity stifling tendency to try to put your ideas in order before you've even generated them. So I teach them, you know what's so great, is that when I was doing the research to how to think like Leonardo and I'm reading Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks. Leonardo gives this advice to his students which now includes you and I and everybody who's sharing this conversation with us. Leonardo says in his notebooks, and you know what I really love about this is, here's maybe the greatest genius of all time and the way he says this, do you ever go into a meeting and say to your colleagues, this may sound weird but bear with me? You made a little disclaimer. Well, here's Leonardo, he makes this disclaimer. He says, this may sound weird but bear with me and then these are his actual words. He says... 

00:13:25
RICH SIMON But he says it with an Italian accent. 

00:13:25
MICHAEL GELB He says it in Italian. But then he says, you'll never less find it useful in quickening the spirit of invention. And he says, the idea is this, you must look at abstract patterns like the smoke that emerges from a fire or the clouds in the sky. He says, let your mind go free. He says, you will see in these an infinity of things. Divine landscapes which you may then reduce to their complete and proper forms. So, what's he saying? He's saying generate first then organize. He's saying, do a flight of fancy, let your imagination go wild. Think of wonderful things which you may then, afterwards, reduce to their complete and proper forms. You know the words, generate first, then organize. Have a flight of fancy. Think of as many ideas as you can. Let you mind go then organize them. And when you learn this simple yin and yang, the rhythm of creative power, it's a revelation for people. Most people are stuck in one or another of those two modalities. So, what mind mapping does is it encourages you to generate, to come up with lots of ideas because it has a non-linear, not top down, framework. You can start anywhere and go anywhere. It gets you to use pictures and images in color which inspires the imaginative part of the brain. If we take that word, imaginative, the root is imaginary, which means to picture internally. So our awakening in that part of the brain. Then as we lay it all out we can then stop and ask ourselves the question, well, okay, what are the important ideas here? And highlight that. What order do I wanna put them in? And it becomes almost self-organizing. So this was my experience, I taught Tony how to juggle. I taught him the Alexander Technique. He taught me speed reading, memory and mind mapping. I mind mapped my master's thesis, which became my first book and that's how I became an author. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON So that people can get a little bit, this is sort of a, let's see. So just that, and we'll give people a link so that they can follow up on this. But basically, the idea here is that you would take, if you can, people can even see this, you might, the classic way I know about it is you take, starting at a hub and you just quickly generate a whole bunch of ideas. Whatever might occur, quickly, or people taking notes on what you're saying. Various key words that you have used. And once they're out there you begin to react to the key words and, here we go. 

00:16:15
MICHAEL GELB Can you see that? Here's some mind maps from my book. It shows you the buildup the mind map step by step so it gets more and more... 

00:16:25
RICH SIMON Elaborate. 

00:16:25
MICHAEL GELB ...depth and nuance. So what's great is detail oriented people actually discover that they can think in a more focused way while also including the imaginative part of the mind and it's more fun. You're drawing, you're letting things flow and its far more creative, way more fun. You get a lot more ideas in a lot less time plus, I have, one of the most satisfying things I get to do is, I lead teams of people in solution finding or problem solving efforts. I recently did a group of 24 construction managers on the strategy of their company over the next five years. And I had each one of them make their mind map individually first. And then I put them in small groups and I had them share the maps with other, with three other people. And I had them just listen as they share, no interruptions, just empathic listening. And if you just do that even without the mind maps, your already on your way to improved communication but the mind map adds a dimension where these tough engineers look at what their colleague is sharing and say, oh, I see what you mean. Oh, now I get the picture. Cause they see the picture. They get the visual track of the ideas as well as the auditory track of the ideas in a natural, fluid way. Then I assign each group of four to make their own map which expresses the consensus of their best thinking. And that brings them together in a profound way. Then the teams present to, so you have six teams of four, each team presents to the overall group. We make a consolidated map which we translate into practical implementation plans. And people invariably say, we got it done so much faster, we were so much more creative, it was so much more fun and much more team building. I'm even more enthusiastic about mind mapping today... 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON It holds up doesn't it? 

00:18:40
MICHAEL GELB ...thirty plus years on than I was when I first learned it. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON So thinking about our audience here. Think about these principles, the mind mapping, these principles of how one improves one's memory. These things that were the hallmark of the work that Buzan generated back in the 70's. In your own, when you think about the context which therapists work, how do these tools apply? You have some thoughts for us about how if someone is interested in, for example, finding out more about mind mapping, not only for their personal development but as a clinician, you've talked about a kind of a group facilitation process. Give us some ideas of how a therapist might use these principles and these ideas about higher performance, higher skill performance in order to help their clients. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL GELB Well, I'm always focused first on the individual fulfillment and wholeness of the given therapist. 

00:19:40
RICH SIMON That's right. That's right. Let's start with that. 

00:19:45
MICHAEL GELB So let's start with that. so you have a whole, a very rich curriculum for your own personal growth, your own wholeness, your own, you know, start by making a mind map of your own life, your own practice, your own goals and dreams, your own purpose, your own mission and then look for the key ways in everyday life that you are not actually living them and begin to make corrections. So that's the most important thing because I don't want anybody to be like the way I perceive my professors at Clark University as God blessed them. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON And occasionally still happens in our field. There are one or two of us jump over that step. 

00:20:25
MICHAEL GELB But you know it's also, I mean in terms of coming to terms with the shadow, coming to terms with the difficult truths about ourselves. There's something about exploring it through the modality of the imagery by drawing images and symbols that gives us more access to the nonverbal, immediately accessible parts of yourself that can lead to much greater insight. So obviously, you do that for yourself but then you can clearly guide your patients or clients into the same process. So, I could see you using this both in terms of planning, in the context of your aiming to get a deeper insight into a particular person that you're working with and you're looking through your notes that you've made over the, make a mind map of what you know about that person. It'll give you a new way of looking and thinking and understanding that particular person. So that's just one obvious thing. 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON So part of this, and to develop this theme and take us along in your own work and different themes that you've been developing over the years, is this notion of the lifelong learner. That there's all kinds of rather disturbing research that says, many of us, very early on, in acquiring a skill or becoming a psychotherapist, and perhaps this is true of your somewhat less than inspiring mentors back in you early days, we reach a certain point and often relatively early on and then we don't move off it. We don't grow, we don't expand our repertoire, we don't improve our skills. So you've, one of the main things that you've talked about, one of the things that is really center to all your books is this notion of a lifelong learner. Talk to us about lifelong learning. Why it's important? And what are the principles that are important to understand in becoming a lifelong learner? 

00:22:30
MICHAEL GELB Well, I think it's really of tremendous importance. I mentioned J.G. Bennett, the teacher I went to and went to study with. And he, you know the classic thing, there are two types of people, those who put everything in two groups and those who don't. And I love simple typologies. I like two types of people and Bennett had a binary typology. Psychostatic and psychokinetic. So the psychostatic individual is devoted to maintaining the status quo. The psychokinetic individual is devoted to lifelong learning and continuous growth. And I think there are two kinds of therapists; those who have accepted a sort of psychostatic notion like, I just need to help people. They can't change. That's too daunting. If we can just help them manage their neurosis so they can get through until they die. And I have a lot of respect for that because the more I've been involved in personal growth and change, the more profound respect I have for the tenacity of habit and the fact that the unconscious is really unconscious. So, you really don't know. Having said that, the path of lifelong learning is a psychokinetic path. Now that the paradigm has shifted. Now that we understand the notion of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, and you know I had to make up two new words to help us understand just what the significance of the old paradigm. I made up these words. One is neurostasis. That was the name for, cause you used to believe that you turned seven and your brain development was done. But it was even worse than that cause at age 30 we believe that your brain started to decline and there was nothing you could do about it. I call it the neuronecrautic paradigm. And we really grew up with a notion of neurostasis and neuronecrautic so personal growth, profound change and transformation seemed like new age nonsense if you held this old paradigm which was dominant until very recently. We all grew up with it and even though we cognitively understand what neuroplasticity means, we cognitively understand the notion of neurogenesis, we have a lot of assumptions that we just adopted from what we were taught about what's possible based on this now defunct paradigm. And why am I spending this much time on this part of the answer? Because if you don't really see the possibility of change, it's a fait accompli. If you don't see, if you don't believe it's possible to learn and grow, improve and develop as you get older, it's not gonna happen. That I can tell you for sure. It turns out, so you had Norman Doidge. You had a conversation... 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON He's coming up. He actually will be our next installment here. 

00:26:00
MICHAEL GELB Fantastic. Well, perfect. The Brain That Changed Itself, brilliant book. Applied clinical neuroplasticity. The New York Times science section, in review of Doidge's book said the following, the power of positive thinking finally gains scientific credibility. The power of positive thinking finally gains scientific credibility. So our attitude towards our ability to learn will dramatically affect our ability to learn for better or for worse. Our attitude towards what happens to our mind as we get older will dramatically affect our ability to either improve or squander the abilities of our memory and our creativity as the years go by. Becca Levy from Harvard did a classic study in which she looked at people, a longitudinal study, those with a positive attitude towards aging, those with a negative attitude towards aging. The people with a positive attitude outlived the people with a negative attitude, the average of over seven and a half years. Now, is that mysticism or magic? No. We now know that the way you think, moment to moment, effects your immune system. We can measure it. You add up those moments over the course of decades and its surprising its only seven and a half years. So it begins with your belief about what's possible for yourself. What's possible for your client or your patient. What's possible? I recently returned from what I called my creativity and innovation world tour. I was in Luca, Florence, Rome, Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney, London, Paris, Bausel, Miami and New Orleans. All in about six weeks and people keep asking me, well what are the highlights of your tour? And the highlights, I had three highlights. Those were people. In Rome I was speaking to the women's international networking conference, a group of a thousand women. And the theme of the conference is women inspiring women and obviously a couple of men. 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Okay, congratulations. Being included. 

00:28:25
MICHAEL GELB Yes, well one of the people...I was invited to the preconference press conference and the woman sitting next to me had no left arm. And she told her story which was just shocking and stunning. Her ex-husband tried to murder her. Shot her with a shotgun at close range. Smashed her hip into smithereens and blew off her left arm. I got to know this woman in the course of the three days. We had drinks together. What impressed me the most about her was her utter lack of resentment. She was there inspiring women, especially women who'd been abused in some ways to live beautiful lives. She was also beautifully upright, clear eyed, she runs a gender consulting business in Norway and she'd recently completed the New York Marathon. Then I'm in Sydney, Australia and I meet this fellow named Sam Cathorn who won the award as the young Australian of the year. He had been in a devastating car accident, lost his right arm, collapsed both his lungs, innumerable broken bones, five months in the hospital, told by the doctors, you will never walk again, clinically pronounced dead at the scene for three and a half minutes. I met him when he was speaking on the same day I spoke at this conference called, My Minute's Potential, and he bounced up on stage, walking, was charming, hilarious, contactful, loving, inspiring. He proclaimed himself the world's best one armed guitarist and then proceeded to use a specially designed prosthetic device, played the guitar for us and sang the song, I am blessed, which we all sang with him. Everybody was crying. Then the tears turned to laughter when he told the story of when he met the prime minister of Australia to get his award as the young Australian of the year and when the prime minister shook hands with his prosthetic right hand the right hand came off in the prime minister's hand and Sam says in his inimitable way, the prime minister found this very disarming. Now, okay, but the message of both of these people was you can overcome crushing adversity and live a beautiful life and continue to learn and grow and evolve and inspire others. So then on the next day of My Minute's Potential one of the speakers was Ramachandran, the great scientist. He's called the Marco Polo of neuroscience by Richard Dawkins. He was named Time Magazine's one of the most influential people in the world. And just ironically he's the world expert on phantom limbs. And he was being interviewed by this really tough minded science journalist and she asked him point blank, isn't all this business about neuroplasticity being oversold. And I have to tell you I held my breath because I felt a little vulnerable. I mean just, you know, the last 30 something years sharing this method, this message. My new book Brain Power is all about this message. I just felt really inspired, tremendously inspired by these two one armed people and here's the world's expert on phantom limbs. Answering this question he paused very thoughtful and he said, no. We can't oversell it at this point because the more we learn the more we realize that we haven't even begun to explore our potential for change and growth and learning. 

00:32:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So, lets, so to, thinking about its a part of being a lifelong learner, part of expanding our repertoire of skills and our ability to be creative and so on is recognizing the possibility, of seeing models that inspire us. It's an attitude shift. What's happened, one of the things that I've been looking around cause I've found all this material that you've been describing so compellingly, not only inspiring, incredibly useful coming out of the 70's and early 80's, where are we now in our ability to give people a technology, and this was a behavioral technology, to start doing mind mapping and to move, my own experience, really do things beyond anything that I could imagine that I could have done before I knew the technique, does it take, it just takes playing around with it and discovering the potential of that particular approach? What have we learned over these last, since that time that really has advanced the ball, particularly, and this is something therapists are often dealing with, have a change? There's a reason that we stay at our plateaus because we're wired to learn certain skills that we then equate to survival and then we don't expand our repertoire of skill and its often, its hard by just the nature of our nervous system to break habits. Not impossible, vision is certainly an element of it. What have we learned that helps us to develop this kind of technology? Of, and I mean that in a broad sense. Of behavior change, habit change, expansion of personal capability? 

00:34:35
MICHAEL GELB Well, I have one of my personal mottoes, I'll give you the polite version of it. Is either its universal wisdom or its baloney. Either its universal wisdom or its baloney. So in other words, the technologies, I believe the most effective technologies, methods for changing habit have been perfected by the world's great religious, wisdom traditions. Not religious but spiritual wisdom tradition. So, the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Sufis, the Taoists. They figured this stuff out hundreds, thousands of years ago and it's been perfected and if you can connect with, you used to have to climb a mountain in the Himalayas and speak, or do a poly, or a Hindi to get some of this wisdom and now it's everywhere. The problem is it's so ubiquitous that people take it for granted. I do think its helping that we are scientifically studying the benefits of meditation, for example, in helping people change their state. Change their mood. We're learning about the benefits of exercise in combatting depression. The work of Dr. John Ratey at Harvard, for example. A lot of things are either common sense, like wearing and thinking about your own problems. Go outside and go for a walk. Or help someone else. Go work in the garden. We're now validating these either common sensical western advice or we're discovering reams of studies on the effects of Tai Chi, Qigong, on effectively rewiring their neuromuscular system. Which is why hundreds of thousands of millions of people in China do this every morning, especially those over 50. Cause it becomes even more beneficial as you get older. So, these are the Tai Chi, the various meditation traditions, this is something I've been studying in one form or another since I was in my teen years and I continue to feel that these are the most effective things that we can learn. Today we call it mindfulness. You know mindfulness based stress training. They're using these scientific sounding words for the great wisdom traditions of the world. 

00:37:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So the focus of this last book, Brain Power, is particularly on the challenge folks in our age bracket are encountering and those even a little younger are moving into advanced age brackets here. Its beginning before we're at our particular stage in life about what one can do to, even though one has an aging brain and aging body, to maintain and even enhance your ability, your abilities, your creativity and so on. What are the important traceables in that process? What are the things that you like to emphasize when you talk to groups about the aging brain and how do we make the best use of what we got? 

00:38:25
MICHAEL GELB Well, it's not just when I talk to groups. It's what do I actually apply myself because, as I said, I've been teaching people this material for 30 years or so, now it's getting serious. 

00:38:40
RICH SIMON Now it's getting personal. 

00:38:40
MICHAEL GELB Its getting poisinal. And I think what happens over the decades is your margin for error gets less. So it becomes that much more important to do everything you can do that will help maintain or even, and this is the really good news, improve your mind as you get older. Cause unlike other parts, our brains are actually designed to improve with use. You know I had hip replacement surgery three years ago. I had knee replacement surgery last year cause I wore those parts out. My mind however, I humbly submit, is getting sharper, more incisive, more focused and I'm way better at synthesizing lots of information and intuitively getting right to the essence of it without worry. I understand, you know, I've learned to, I'm friends with the creative process. The muses and I are on a first name basis. This has happened over time by applying these principles. By using them to write my books and design my lectures. I'm fully confident in the flow of a creative gift when I need it and I know how to invoke it. It's not I who does it. I do the invocation and the creative process is available. But its available to all of us. So by living and working with these principles for years I've had a sense of the areas of which I'm maybe getting better and I'm clear about the ones which are challenges like my hip and my knee for example. So, having said all that, what I was aiming to do, not just for myself but for anyone who has a brain and is getting older, which is all of us, is cut through all of the constant onslaught of information, much of which is often conflicting, especially around diet, or what kind of exercise you should do. You know, one person says, well, we just found out that people in their 50's do much worse on memory test than people in their 20's so that's proof that the brain is degrading. Rubbish. Who has been taking tests more frequently, people who are in their 20's or people who are in their 50's more recently? Obviously, people in their 20's. People in their 50's are out of practice. Turns out if you practice them up on test taking they'll do just as well as the people in their 20's. Same thing with even learning how to juggle for example. Some German researchers did a study and they found that people in their 50's and 60's learn juggling just as fast as people in their 20's. There was one group, 28 to 34 who learned a little bit faster than people in their 80's as a matter of fact in the study. So, I said, what other research validated practical things that the average person can do to actually improve their mind as they get older. I'll take you through them really quickly and then if you have questions we can go on to that. The first one we've already discussed a lot. It is attitude. Attitude makes a tremendous difference. Why? Simply because if you don't believe it's possible to improve you're not gonna do anything else that I tell you. Moreover, we've learned that, you know I say take a daily dose of GFH: gratitude, forgiveness and humor. We've learned that these attitudes, and they're being scientifically studied, we've learned that an attitude, when you feel gratitude it strengthens your immune system for example. Same thing for forgiveness. Same thing with humor. Having a purpose in life also seems to help prevent dementia. So, if you don't know what your purpose is, I'll give it to you. It's to figure out your purpose. So attitude, these are some of the elements of attitude. I go into these in a lot of depth in the book. next one is to learn something new every day. 15 minutes. So the classic study people are familiar with New England Journal of Medicine, Professor Joe Verghese and his colleagues. It's the one that for some reason they publicized the notion of doing crosswords even though that's not what came out as most important to do to prevent dementia. They found that people who play chess, bridge, go, mental sports, those activities, learning those activities had the strongest effect on the brain in terms of measurably preventing dementia. Other things that seemed to be very effective, learning a musical instrument, learning a new language. Another study also by German researchers. Professor Arne May at the University of Regensburg and his colleagues found that learning to juggle, 15 minutes a day for three months, dramatically improves the resilience in people's brains. So I asked Dr. Dan Amen, who wrote Magnificent Mind at Any Age and has done more than 50,000 brain scans, I said, what if people don't wanna play chess or learn to juggle? What's the real underlying thing here? He said, its challenge and novelty. Challenge your brain, do something new 15 minutes a day. And what's important to understand is this is not just nice advice. There's more and more of a body of solid research that suggests that this really prevents dementia, prevents Alzheimer's. And especially if you've had Alzheimer's in your family you wanna be doing all of these things. So learning something new every day, challenging your brain. Something new. Nutrition and exercise, obviously they go hand in hand. Let's talk about exercise first. Lot of what passes for senility is oxygen deprivation to the brain caused by being out of shape. I mean, your brain's two and a half percent of your body's weight, uses more than twenty percent of the oxygen and if you're out of shape for ten, twenty, thirty years, you're not getting the circulation and therefore the oxygen to your brain. So, the so called senior moment is a function not of chronology but of conditioning. I interviewed Dr. Walter Bortz who's 80 and he said that most everything that we associate with chronology has nothing to do with chronology and everything to do with conditioning. He just rain his 40th marathon. Wrote Living Longer for Dummies. So, regular exercise, and again, the secret is to find something that you love. I go into this again in a lot of depth in the book because this is something I love to do; walk, riding your bike, going to a dance class and especially valuable the ancient Chinese arts of Qigong and Tai Chi. People ask me, well, what do you practice yourself? I do Tai Chi and Qigong for an hour every day. At least an hour every day. Cause now it's serious. Nutrition, again. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON Now its personal. 

00:46:15
MICHAEL GELB Right. Now its personal. Nutrition, it'll drive you crazy. There's so many contrasting things but I was looking for, the neuroscientists that I interviewed, what's the consensus. I couldn't find anybody who said, don't drink enough water. Everyone says keep yourself hydrated. Your brain's 80% water. It's pretty much common sense. Avoid excess sugar. Avoid any kind of processing or chemistry in your food. Michael Pollen said it really well, if your great grandmother wouldn't recognize it as food, don't eat it. You know, watch for, moderate high glycemic carbs because much of our problem with weight and body image and so on, it's a function of metabolism not calories. That's where the exercise is so important because you want to regulate your metabolism and then enjoy dining. Make it a pleasure. Again, mindfulness is the popular word but it's always been my philosophy, pause, ask yourself the question, what am I really in the mood for? And then ask yourself this critical question, how will I feel after I eat it? That's the diet. That's all you need to do. Cause if you tune in, if you ask those two questions and you exercise so you get more accurate information from your own system and you focus on savoring and enjoying dining, you know, it's great news. It turns out dark chocolate in moderation, really good for us. Red wine in moderation, really good for us. Pause, savor, be grateful, share your meal with somebody else. Put more dolce in your vita and be happier, healthier. There's a lot more to it but these are some of the simple consensus. I couldn't find anybody, any neuroscientists I discussed this with who didn't agree wholeheartedly with what I just told you. Next is, I quote, create a brain nourishing environment. Which very simply is to expose yourself to beauty every day. You know the classic study, Rosenzweig and Marian Diamond did with the stimulus deprived versus the stimulus rats. The stimulus deprived rats are in the rat equivalent of cubicles. Their brains shrink. They attack each other whenever they get the chance. They can't solve labyrinths. Stimulus rich rats, they have lots of games to play and fun rat things to do. Their brains are bigger and stronger. They get along well with other rats. They solve mazes and labyrinths much better. Indications for us, if you're in a cubicle, if you're driving in traffic, if you're turning on your television, if you're looking at billboards. The default setting of our contemporary world is junk. Its garbage inn. The good news is we have more access to the greatest forms of exquisite beauty from every tradition, human culture, than ever before. So, you know, in our office, I'm speaking to you from my office, on this computer from which I'm speaking to you there's a default setting for music in our household which is a 20 hour Mozart loop. Cause we know your Don Campbell who passed away sadly earlier this year wrote the classic, the Mozart Effect and he documented the effect of Mozart's music on the brain. So they're now using Mozart in hospital wards and patients not only have lower infection rates but the nurses report greater job satisfaction. And my favorite is when they play Mozart in dairies and the cows give more milk. They call it the Moozart effect. So consciously, whether its Mozart, whether it's having fresh flowers on your desk, whether its putting Leonardo on your screensaver, whether it's getting out and making a conscious, if you live in a city, journey to some natural phenomenon, pausing and looking at the clouds, taking time to enjoy the sunrise and the sunset, this is nurturing your soul and your brain. The next part of a brain nourishing environment is so important I made it a separate chapter in the book and it's to invest in your social wealth. So a classic study, groups of people age 80, they controlled for as many factors as they could and found that people who define themselves as lonely are dramatically more likely to have some form of dementia over the next four years than those who felt they had positive regular social interaction. You know, George Byrne said, when he turned 100, he said, I'd like to go out with women my own age but there aren't any left. Which expresses the fact that it takes effort as you get older to have social wealth. We all think about our 401K and our retirement plan but the most important part of that may be nurturing friendships and relationships. So you wanna learn new things, go learn them in a group. Go to a group Tai Chi class. Go to a group dance class. Meet new people. Volunteer. You know, volunteering helps the person who volunteers as much as the person who's being mentored or taken care of. And then, and then the last chapter of the book. The last of the principles focuses on the critical importance of rest and relaxation. Most Americans are chronically dehydrated. We need to drink a lot more water. And we're chronically sleep deprived. We need a lot more sleep and rest. Anecdotally, it always fascinated me. These great geniuses like Leonardo and Thomas Edison took naps. Now we have the work of Professor Mark Rosekind who found that when NASA pilots took regular naps their productivity went up 36%. I mean that's real bottom line productivity oriented organization. You have the work of Robert Stickgold at Harvard, Sara Mednick, take a nap, change your life. We go into detail, what's the best way to do it, how long to do it so you don't get groggy and you optimize performance but there's such a preponderance of evidence now, although our work culture doesn't support it yet because we haven't integrated it. Same thing with sleep. So that's where meditation comes in because meditation, 20 minutes of meditation gives you the physiological effects of about three hours of restful sleep. So leaving aside the spiritual benefits, the benefits in terms of concentrated rest that accrue from meditation, are profound. My coauthor of this new book, Brain Power, is one of the world experts in binaural beat technology. She created something called... 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Say that one again. What kind of technology? 

00:53:35
MICHAEL GELB Binaural beat technology. It's the phenomenon, if we play, you know, 108 hertz in your left ear and 100 in your right, your brain will hear a tone of four hertz. Using that phenomenon we can entrain your brainwave state. So in other words you can listen to these tones and we can entrain your brain. We can play an alpha rhythm. We can play a fader rhythm. If you need help sleeping we can play a delta rhythm. So Kelly has specialized in this for the last 30 years and our book comes with a download of binaural beat program to help you meditate and help you sleep cause we figure people need all the help they can get. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Speaking of which, and we just have a few minutes left so let's pull back for a moment here and focusing on the, something that we've talked a lot about in our magazine and our conference this year is going to be devoted to this idea of therapy as a craft and continuing to develop one's craft across the course of a career. So one of the things that we've, that you've been very clear about and very eloquent about is the importance of starting with yourself and all of the ways we talked about taking better care of yourself, all the principles of living and taking care of your brain and developing your creativity and so on, as a piece of that. And the next step that, if you were to give advice to somebody who's developed, highly developed as a juggler, as a martial artist, as a master presenter, you've put a lot of effort in your life in developing these skills, your craft, a whole range of crafts that you have mastered. Do you have some thoughts for us about developing our craft in addition to taking care of ourselves and this attention to our personal instrument. How does one enhance one's craft? How do we develop a craft to the level of mastery? 

00:55:50
MICHAEL GELB Role models and peer review. To give you the succinct answer. My passion now, one of my great passions, one of the crafts I was interested in master was Akido. I trained in Akido very intensively for over 20 years. I studied with many of the great masters. I got their video tapes and watched them over and over again. But most importantly I went and met them and had them throw me around. And that more than anything, and then I would review what I learned with my peers. I am now on a quest, a path of mastery in Qigong and Tai Chi. I have identified three masters who I have a personal relationship with and I spend as much time with them as I possibly can and then I practice every day, of course, and then I review my practice with peers when I can find them. So, who are the therapists that you most admire. Don't just read their books, go and meet them. Have a series of therapy sessions with them. Find out when they're teaching a workshop and make sure that you're on it. I mean, that's, if you wanna learn creativity you go to Leonardo. You wanna learn innovation you go to Thomas Edison. You wanna learn therapy? Who was your role model or, try to find more than one. It's good to cross reference them. I have three phenomenal Qigong masters at the moment. Each with very different style. And I decided three is, I can handle the curriculum of all three of them. 

00:57:45
RICH SIMON How much you can integrate. 

00:57:45
MICHAEL GELB Its stretching me to the max but I'm reading all their books. I'm having private lessons with them whenever possible. And I get specific points of learning where I can change how I practice and deepen my insight and it seems to be working cause I am, I just turned 60. I just came back from the creativity and innovation world tour. I gave keynotes or full day seminars in all of those different cities around the world and I feel great. I mean I never had so much fun doing what I do. I think it's partly also because I appreciate, I'm more grateful and the sense of gratitude of having the opportunity is also very sustaining but I just have more chi. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON And it's good to have mentors who learned from their flaws as you were, as we started here as we come to an end. Of all your professors and early mentors who did not have that quality of integration and so that... 

00:58:50
MICHAEL GELB The anti-role models. Think of the therapist that you despise and don't do what they do. 

00:59:00
RICH SIMON Don't do as they have done. 

00:59:00
MICHAEL GELB Don't do that! Oy vey. 

00:59:05
RICH SIMON We just have a few moments left. I wanna remind people about our comment board. Michael has taken us on an extremely interesting journey here through the literature of the brain and the literature of how to take care of one's aging brain and how to enhance creativity and learning and so on. So, whatever stood out for you, do a mind map following this. Share the product of that mind map with us. If you have some questions, pass those along. Michael's a busy guy but he'll look at these comments. He may well be so moved he may respond. But the main thing is to keep this conversation going and as he was just saying a moment ago, the importance of this idea of a community of practice. Social wealth of interaction that we learn through exercising our social muscles as much as anything. Michael, for folks who want to learn more about your work and this whole, go through this doorway that you're, this conversation has provided over the course of this last hour, what are some resources that they can check out. 

01:00:15
MICHAEL GELB Well, best is to go to my website, michaelgelb.com. Its G E L B, michaelgelb.com. People always ask me, what book should I start with. I would suggest, How to Think Like Leonardo and the workbook. Brain Power is my latest. I'm working on a new book about innovation in communication which I think will probly be of great interest to therapists. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON Okay. Sounds great. 

01:00:45
MICHAEL GELB There's also on the website, there's lots of free articles. People go to the articles page. You can download free articles on everything from the great geniuses of history to wine tasting and its relationship to creative thinking. 

01:01:00
RICH SIMON That's great. Sir, thank you. I've known Michael for close to, over 25 years now. Great to see you even with your aging brain moving on and exploring new horizons. What an interesting conversation. Thank you for taking the time to be with us this afternoon. 

01:01:20
MICHAEL GELB My pleasure. Thank you. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON That's it for this installment of neuroscience in action. We hope you join us next time. Bye bye for now.
