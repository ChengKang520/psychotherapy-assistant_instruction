and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal in time-limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real-life problems.

BUILDING ON ADOLESCENT EXPERTISE: A SOLUTION-ORIENTED APPROACH 

00:01:45
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON I'm Jon Carlson. I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy: Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos. And this is our guest Matthew Selekman who's gonna talk to us about his approach to brief therapy. Matthew, just how would you define Brief Therapy? 

00:02:10
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

00:02:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I look at brief therapy as an efficient, um, goal-focused, action-oriented approach. And we stop therapy when clients are telling that they're feeling satisfied and we've stabilized or resolved whatever they're presenting concern is. 

00:02:30
JON CARLSON And if I understand things right, you call this "solution-focused brief therapy?" 

00:02:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I have my own version. I call it "solution-oriented brief family therapy." 

00:02:35
JON CARLSON I see. Well, can you talk about your strategy or your approach? Just, how does it work? 

00:02:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I believe that the base solution focus brief Therapy model can be quite effective with a wide range of child and adolescent kinds of problems, but there are some more challenging, uh, complex clinical situation that require a much more flexible approach. So I have tapped ideas from the narrative therapy approach, um, MRI brief strategic model, and some post-modern therapy, uh, models like the work of, uh, Harry Goolishian and Harlene Anderson. Um, so that I've a, a much more flexible model that I'm ready to move in any direction that a family member wants to take me. 

00:03:20
JON CARLSON How does it work? I mean, is there, what, do you follow some steps or do you follow? 

00:03:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:03:25
JON CARLSON Are you working at thinking or are you working at doing or? 

00:03:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, I like to begin keeping things fairly simple and capitalizing on any pre-treatment changes that the clients have already made happen for themselves and try and build off of what's working. But for some clients that have been oppressed by their problems for some time, it's very hard for them to remember the times or even access hypothetically, um, what things would look like when things are better. So therefore it might make sense to try and externalize the problem, um, especially if they describe a presenting problem as oppressive and chronic in nature. Um, that might be one avenue. Another, uh, avenue might be to, especially if they're very problem-focused in the way they're presenting their situation, is to track the problem sequence of events and utilize pattern intervention strategies to disrupt that problem-maintaining cycle. Um, and there might be some family members that have been traumatized or have a long story to tell about their painful past or their oppressive current situation and I wanna make room to have them tell their story unedited by me. So I'm carefully watching them, verbal, and the verbal, you know, listening to the verbal feedback from the clients and then adjusting what I do in relationship to what, how they wanna cooperate with me. 

00:04:50
DIANE KJOS How, how did you get to this place in terms of your approach to, to therapy? What, tell us a little about that, your personal journal, journey here. 

00:05:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, first of all, I began more as a structural-strategic family therapist and, um, then I had some exposure to the solution-focused model, um, and saw how, how powerful it is in terms of, um, recognizing that clients are resourceful and creative and can be well on their way to solving their problems well before they come in to see us. So let's, let's build off of that. But I was running an adolescent substance abuse program and there were a number of kids and families in there that had had multiple treatment failures, um, and had long stories to tell. And I think for some of these clients, they felt slighted when I overemphasized the, you know, the solution-focused orientation, um, that they couldn't talk about what was right because they were so in this doom-and-gloom mode and so, feeling so stuck and pessimistic that I had to, to stop utilizing solution-oriented questions and make more room for them to tell their stories, um, and, and, and talk about how they felt oppressed by this situation. Um, and then, once they've given me some indication that they wanna move on and focus on something specific, we'll try and negotiate some kind of goal. And we can always return back to the solution-oriented questions, but I really feel that as therapists, we need to be flexible and respectful of our clients' plights. 

00:06:25
JON CARLSON How did you get to be so darned optimistic? I mean, there must be some story about your mother or something that you can tell us that gives us some insight into that. 

00:06:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny. My, my mom tends to be a pretty optimistic person, um, and I remember when I was in, uh, high school, and boy, I had a rough time in high school as a teenager, but I remember before the football game she'd say, "Okay, Matthew, you, you kick butt today!" you know? But she'd, and that was really inspiring, you know? And she always would say, you know, you know, "Smile," you know, "You can weather this storm," you know, "Dig in," "You can do it," you know, so she was always encouraging me, certainly it's been a help. 

00:07:05
JON CARLSON So that's where your early training came? 

00:07:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. She was a pretty solution-oriented mother, I think, yeah. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON Well, help me, uh, I'm still struggling with a little bit about this approach. Uh, how, how does change take place in your approach? I mean, you've mentioned all different kinds of things, but how does it work? 

00:07:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I think there's two areas that, um, get addressed in this way of working. One is, um, client beliefs. You know, when the clients come in, it's like tunnel vision. And what I wanna do is try and present them with a kaleidoscopic view on their situation, that there's many ways to look at your situation which can help loosen up fixed beliefs about what's going on in here and open up space for possibilities. 

00:07:50
JON CARLSON So you're changing beliefs and changing perceptions? 

00:07:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Changing the doing, changing the interactions, helping family members learn new dance steps or doing more of what's working and steering clear of what hasn't worked. 

00:08:00
JON CARLSON Is, is there a, a process that you follow? Are there steps, uh, that you do when you work with a family? 

00:08:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, typically I'll begin by, um, you know, joining and connecting with family members around their strengths and resources. Then 

00:08:20
JON CARLSON So it's kind of a relationship focused first part. 

00:08:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. And then moving into, um, you know, what specifically would they like to work on changing. Um, I don't begin with what is the problem. I wanna know what they wanna change today. 

00:08:30
JON CARLSON So to find the solution? 

00:08:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. Well, yeah, except, yeah, give me a direction. Give me clues. And, and another question that I ask a lot is, I'll ask parents if there is one question you were dying to ask me about this, this problem situation, what would that question be? Which will give us clues and point us in the direction of potential solution strategies. Um. 

00:08:55
JON CARLSON Okay, so you've defined the solution. Then what do you do? 

00:08:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Once we have some sense about clients, um, what clients wanna resolve and it's been broken down into manageable terms, um, that's when I will use, uh, an outcome-oriented question like the miracle question. Sometimes I use, I have an imaginary crystal ball and I'll have people gaze in this crystal ball, you know, week or two weeks down the road telling me, you know, as clearly as possible, what, what those changes look like. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON That's what a miracle question resembles. 

00:09:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Very similar, yeah. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON You're trying to, if a miracle were to occur, 

00:09:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah, if you woke up. 

00:09:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I wanna know what things will look like when the problem is resolved. Um, and then I'm gonna ask about, to get at pre-treatment changes that are already happening, I'm gonna ask them, are there any pieces of this miracle happening a little bit now? 

00:09:45
JON CARLSON Okay. So that's kind of like looking for exceptions to the rules? 

00:09:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:09:45
JON CARLSON And it's not a problem all the time. 

00:09:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. And the times when they're coping and problem solving effectively and useful self talk and whatever, whatever they're doing that seems to be working for them, just see how I can build off of that and with them collaboratively co-construct a solution. 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON You work together with everybody. 

00:10:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON And, I, I've noticed, though, that in reading about your approach that you sometimes use a more strategic model in which you separate different family members into subgroups and meet with people individually or collectively. Uh, what's your, you know, is, is that the strategic element coming in? 

00:10:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh, yeah, and I also think that, especially when you're working with adolescents, you really have to work both sides of the fence. You really have to, you know, meet along with parents and, and, um, in some cases, empower them or look at the various ways that they got stuck with their kids, negotiate solvable problems with them if you need to do further work there, come up with a realistic goal, and maybe you give them some kind of experiment to play around with over the week in the relationship with the kid. And at the same time meeting along with the kid to find out, you know, I always like to ask them how can I be helpful to you? I wanna elicit, uh, the adolescent's, um, expectations of me, of their parents, um, what their goals are, what privileges they want, and, and, and be able to convey to them that I'm happy to go to bat for you, uh, and set up a quid pro quo kind of contract. 

00:11:20
DIANE KJOS Uh, so I've heard pieces of narrative and strategic and soluc-, solution-focused. Is there, uh, anything else that we've missed on that? 

00:11:25
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

00:11:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, the one piece that we haven't talked about is, um, one part of my work that I really enjoy immensely is the collaborative work with the larger systems, helping professionals that are often involved, particularly with adolescent cases, um, high risk type adolescent populations. And I like to invite the family to tell me who I need to collaborate with. Um, and then I get releases signed as early in treatment as possible and we will have a, you know, family multiple-helper meetings. And some fantastic stuff happens in these meetings where family members talk about things perhaps they didn't talk about in individual therapy. So I like to look at these helpers as potential allies that also have strengths and resources that I can tap to help me help the family. Um, and that also includes bringing in, I like to ask adolescents, you know, in times of trouble when you're really stressed out, you know, which friend will you call, or friends? And I might even recruit that, bring them into family sessions as guest consultants or bring them into these big pow-wow meetings with involved helping professionals. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Uh, I suppose the, the bottom line question always has to come up, does it work, and is there a research base or research support for this model? 

00:12:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, a lot, I know that at the Brief Family Therapy Center they've done some research projects, one of which was looking at the relationship between therapists that engage in change talk or solution talk and positive treatment outcomes over time versus those therapists that spend a lot of time focusing on problems, you know, going into the past and searching for the whys and negative treatment outcome. Um, they've also done some follow-up, phone survey research. The problem with that kind of research is not very reliable. I mean, often times, over time clients won't remember things or they wanna be polite, you know, say what you wanna hear. Um, there have been some more anthropological studies done, um, which we call family ethnography where someone who's never seen the family before will interview them about what their experience is like. And all these studies show the same thing and that is what really was key for these families was the relationship skills of the therapist, in some cases structuring skills of therapists at times could take charge came across as being competent, confident, and those were the things that they remembered most. It wasn't the model, per say. Although I've had some clients that we've evaluated where they had said, like, had this one mother say that, "My son was walking around doing all these good things around the house and I didn't even tell him to do it." You know, here was the hypnotic element, the trance-like piece. Um, and, and she was referring to like, the secret surprise. Um, I've had some clients say, "You know, those number questions, those scaling questions were really helpful because we knew where we stood in counseling. It was like a guidepost." Um, so, you know, but, but what we know about the outcome research, it's like, therapy is only 15% of what counts is the technical line of things. And what counts the most is, number one, the client's, capitalizing on the client's strengths and resources, and number two, the relationship. 

00:14:35
JON CARLSON True. 

00:14:35
DIANE KJOS So, so, I'm su-, you know, do you ever have one that doesn't work and, and, and how, what, what are, are there families or, or issues that just get stuck? 

00:14:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:14:50
JON CARLSON Treatment-resistant kinds of things. So your approach? 

00:14:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, um, I was working with a family where I connected very well with the kid, and this was a holy terror, uh, 17-year-old who's going to rave parties, poly-drug abusing, uh, sexually acting out, um, failing in school, not even going to school at times. Um, the parents, it turned out that, um, she came out to me that she was a lesbian and, you know, the family, the parents were very religious and from different cultural backgrounds, um, and backgrounds in which there was zero tolerance for alternative lifestyles. And so I think I helped her cope with that and gave her some survival tools and skills, um, but I think that, okay, we did resolve the fact that she stopped going to rave parties, she stopped doing drugs and things of that nature, but the monolithic goal of the parents was to zap her and make her not be lesbian, 'kay, which was an impossible task. Didn't do that. 

00:15:55
DIANE KJOS Couldn't manage that one. 

00:15:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:15:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:15:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So, um, so if anything, at least the daughter's hooked up to a support system and she's doing better, but ultimately, I wasn't able to pull off the impossible. 

00:16:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:16:05
JON CARLSON But you do seem to work, uh, with some pretty difficult cases. I know you've done some work with some adolescents who, you know, either attempt suicide or do cutting. Can you tell me a little bit about that work? 

00:16:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. Um, a lot of these kids, you know, have a variety of reasons for why they cut or burn. Um, a lot of it has to do with the fact that many of them feel disconnected from their parents, um, and also in their families, they're, what has been modeled is the mismanagement of anger. That when you're angry, it's risky business to release it or to lash out. So let's put a lid on it till you cut yourself and that puts the top on it. Or some of these kids feel emotionally dead inside and when they cut themselves, they feel alive. Um, you know, and again, that ties into this whole emotional disconnection piece. So, so a lot of the therapy is creating and validating a relationship between the parents and the kid, building and then nurturing peace. Um, and at the same time, teaching these young men and women, um, soothing techniques, you know, meditation, um, you know, getting involved in exercise if they're not, um, ways to comfort themselves, visualization techniques. 

00:17:20
JON CARLSON So when these kids cut themselves are they trying to kill themselves? Are they trying to end their lives? 

00:17:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Most of these kids do not wanna die. It usually happens accidentally. They sever a vein or an artery of some sort. 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:17:35
DIANE KJOS It sounds like you're doing some, teaching some parenting skills as well in this process. 

00:17:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN It's an important piece and sometimes the parents have a real tough marital situation and these kids, and kids, I think by nature are benevolent, um, will become sort of like, will sacrifice themselves. 

00:17:50
DIANE KJOS Ah, to keep 

00:17:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN To keep the parents together. Um, I had one case I was involved with where I was called in, emergency. School social worker had this kid who had train-track cuts up and down her arms. And this just happened, I guess, the night before the father was talking about leaving the mom and them splitting up. And so, who was in the office with us? Mom and Dad. 

00:18:15
DIANE KJOS Sure. 

00:18:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN The dad decided to stay. 

00:18:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:18:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So in some ways, in a self-destructive way, she was being helpful to preserve the family. Um, so a lot of the work is to try and de-triangulate or get these kids out of the marriage and taking care of themselves and crossing the bridge and helping the parents work on their unresolved issues. 

00:18:35
JON CARLSON In a minute, we'll watch you work with a family that at first seemed that way too, seemed like it was very dysfunctional. Uh, uh, a mother and, uh, her 14-year-old daughter, and when we first heard about them, uh, they lived with a step-father and, uh, I think there's seven siblings all together and, and this young girl at 14 was, uh, dating, uh, a couple of different boys who were 24, you know, almost, uh, a lot older and, uh, she'd had no contact with her birth father who lived right nearby for years. I mean, this sounds to me like an overwhelming, uh, family as, uh, as we presented it to you. What were your thoughts when you heard some of this initial data on them? 

00:19:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN The, I, I suspected that things were kinda chaotic. Um, having all these children, um, and hearing that the daughter, you know, was engaging in this kind of behavior, but, but you see, I don't allow myself to get one, wedded to any one hypothesis or one way of looking. I'm always trying to keep my mind open for the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth possible explanation for what's going on here. And for whatever reason within this family, that might be seen as okay or adaptive or, you know, this could be, this could be modern parents who don't see anything wrong with that or whatever. But I'm not in place to judge, you know, how they decide to operate. Um, if that's something that they wanna work on and that's problematic, we'll address that, but the clients take the lead in defining where we begin. 

00:20:15
DIANE KJOS So you don't go in with a list of problems and say, okay, let's start with this one. 

00:20:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, they decide. 

00:20:20
DIANE KJOS They decide. 

00:20:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN They're in the driver's seat. 

00:20:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. Are there any particular things we should be looking for as we watch this video? 

00:20:25
JON CARLSON Both with you and your techniques. 

00:20:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. And I think one thing that, um, I think I connect really well with kids and I think that came from working as a child care worker, living and breathing with a lot of tough kids for a number of years and tu-, learning how to enter their worlds. But I also use a lot of humor in my work. Um, I think humor heals and creates possibilities and helps people move away from the doom and gloom, you know, outlook, um, and, and helps them loosen up and enjoy each other's company. And, and sometimes family members haven't laughed together in each other's company for some time. So the use of self, uh, I think it'd be helpful to watch how I use humor, um, how I use metaphors as a way of helping people look at things differently and, and play. 

00:21:15
JON CARLSON And was there a time that you noticed where your thinkings changed? Was there, you often talk about in an interview where you can feel that moment that things, there's a shift that takes place? 

00:21:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I think this whole part of interactionalizing the anger management problem when I was talking about, um, how it must run in the genes that people have a hard time managing their anger and kinda interactionalizing the problem because I felt that we kinda moved from, um, looking at the problem as the kid to sort of dissolving that idea that, um, that essentially this is a family problem. 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON And so that happened and 

00:21:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You have to work together. 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON And that happened in the first maybe 10 minutes or so that you were able to change that perception of the problem, I guess. 

00:22:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. And that's what I think this is all about, helping dissolve the idea that this is a problem and that it's Tiffany's problem. And, and interactionalizing it so that they all have to take responsibility for resolving the concern. 

00:22:15
JON CARLSON Okay. Well, let's watch the interview. 

00:22:15
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:22:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I'd like to get started off by getting to know both of you a little bit. Um, are you working now, Kathy? 

00:22:25
KATHY Uh, no. I've actually just got hired, uh, to start working for the census as a numerator so I will be working part-time in March. 

00:22:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And how'd you get into that kinda work? 

00:22:35
KATHY Uh, a flyer came through, uh, one of the kid's backpacks and it's make your own hours kinda thing and it sounded like it would be about the only thing I could do. 

00:22:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sort of a good parent job. 

00:22:45
KATHY Yeah, exactly. 

00:22:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Flexibility. 

00:22:45
KATHY Exactly. 

00:22:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Have you done other kind of sort of work? 

00:22:50
KATHY No, off and on a little bit of waitressing just to fill in, uh, the supplement income sometimes, but other than that, no. It's basically 30 loads of laundry a week and. 

00:22:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 30 loads? 

00:23:00
KATHY Yes! Yes. 

00:23:00
KATHY How many kids? 

00:23:00
KATHY Seven kids. 

00:23:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Seven kids. And what's the age range? 

00:23:05
KATHY Um, they go from six months to almost 15. 

00:23:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. So you have a lot of variety, then. 

00:23:10
KATHY Yes. 

00:23:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And are you the oldest of them? 

00:23:15
TIFFANY Well, second oldest. My sister's two month's older than me. 

00:23:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Oh, okay. All right. Um, hobbies, interests? 

00:23:20
KATHY I love to read, but I don't get much chance to so I buy the books and put them on the shelf and hope that some day I'll get to read them. Um. 

00:23:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN The Opera's, uh, Choices? 

00:23:30
KATHY Opera, yes. Oh, yeah. And, like, and I like Opera's show. I love Opera, so. She's one thing that I do do every day. I get up and have coffee and go about my business watching that. 

00:23:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So you're, you're an expert on, on Opera's, uh, work and? 

00:23:45
KATHY Exactly. 

00:23:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Do you, what do you like most about it? 

00:23:50
KATHY Um, I like, I like the way that, that she tries to make people feel good, you know, feel good about themselves, find out why they're not feeling good about themselves, uh, you know, not really like, blaming everybody and all this stuff all the time because I, I dunno. It seems like here lately that's like the trend, you know, just to hate your parents and hate everybody and it's everybody else's fault and I don't, I've never felt that that's a, a good way. I think you need take ownership and, and deal with things, you know? Everybody's got a story and everybody's had tragedies, you know, and if you say, well, this happened to me and so therefore I can't go on, it's just, uh, I think that's good. And sh-, I think she's real good about promoting all this positive stuff, you know? 

00:24:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I agree. 

00:24:35
KATHY So that's why I like her. She makes me feel good. 

00:24:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Good. And Tiffany, what grade are you in? 

00:24:45
TIFFANY Eighth. 

00:24:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Eighth grade. Boy, I, has, have other people thought you were a lot older? I was gonna say you were like, 16 and in high school. 

00:24:50
TIFFANY Yeah. 

00:24:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. And, um, are you involved in any school activities at all? 

00:24:55
TIFFANY I play the clarinet. That's it. 

00:24:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You do? What, what kind of music do you like to play? 

00:25:00
TIFFANY I don't really like to play it. I have to, though. 

00:25:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? For, because Mom, or? 

00:25:10
TIFFANY That and because only other things offered is gym and art, and I don't like art and I don't like the way I look in a gym uniform, so. 

00:25:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. And, uh, what hobbies and interests do you have? 

00:25:20
TIFFANY I like music. 

00:25:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? What kind of music do you like the most? 

00:25:25
TIFFANY Alternative or rock. 

00:25:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. Uh, how about rock, who do you like? 

00:25:30
TIFFANY I like Korn. 

00:25:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? You like the hard, driving rock, yeah. Okay. All right, well, um, I guess I'd like to start off with my asking you, you know, if our meeting today proved to be helpful to you, um, what, what questions will you have had answered or what changes might have occurred that, um, you know, you driving off, you'd say, "Wow, you know, that was worthwhile?" 

00:25:55
KATHY Um, I would say, um, my biggest concern, the reason I'm here is that, that there seems to be a lot of anger and bitterness in Tiffany and, uh, I want her to be able to deal with that effectively. I don't want her to be lashing out at everybody and being angry at everybody and being angry at herself and, and, um, be able to, 'cuz see, she's, I've always told her since she was little that she's beautiful and that she's smart and that she can do anything, and she's always had that self-esteem buildup and I don't know what's just all of a sudden happened. And she has a father, her biological father who lives 20 minutes away and hasn't seen her in eight years. 

00:26:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 20 minutes away and not, eight years? 

00:26:45
KATHY Yes. 

00:26:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, what, what gets in the way there? 

00:26:50
TIFFANY He's a crackhead. 

00:26:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN He's a crackhead? 

00:26:50
KATHY That's a joke, though, not literally. I mean, it's not. 

00:26:55
TIFFANY Well, we don't know. 

00:26:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You suspect that he's doing coke? 

00:26:55
TIFFANY I dunno. He's doing something. 

00:27:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:27:00
TIFFANY He's weird. 

00:27:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Um, give me a recent, blow-by-blow, video tape description of the situation where you saw what you're describing as her anger and bitterness, um, a recent scenario. I, you know. 

00:27:15
KATHY Um, one of the sisters'll come into her room or open the door, maybe without knocking and she'll lash out at her. You know, "I hate you!" 

00:27:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Physically, or? 

00:27:25
KATHY Oh, no, it's all verbal. I, you know, I would almost rather everybody in my family just start beating each other at this point because it's all verbal and it's emotional and to me it's 10 times worse. I'd rather somebody just punched me! "I hate you," "I can't stand you," "get out of here," "you're fat," "you're ugly." 

00:27:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
KATHY You know? 

00:27:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So, putdowns. 

00:27:45
KATHY Yeah, and then even with some of the older children and then we get in, you know, to escalated, uh, nasty, bad words. 

00:27:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay, so somebody comes in her room and she says all those things. Then what happens after that? 

00:28:00
KATHY Then usually just goes right down the line. Then one kid'll go to the next youngest kid and laying shot on them, so. 

00:28:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Oh, so it's like a domino effect. 

00:28:05
KATHY It's just a, yeah, right. And then our dog is old enough so they don't kick him, so I don't know where the ending. 

00:28:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN The dog doesn't start barking? 

00:28:15
KATHY The mog's, dog's downstairs in confinement, so. 

00:28:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay, and then what, who does the dog go after? 

00:28:20
KATHY Nobody. I guess that's why he's old and dying. He just, yeah. He just doesn't, uh. He has nobody. 

00:28:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How do you respond then, um, you know, after, let's say that she kicks it off, and chews out somebody comes in her room, and then what do you typically do? 

00:28:35
KATHY Depending on what time of day it is, uh, if it's 

00:28:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How about recently? Can you think of a situation where you had to manage this kind of thing? 

00:28:45
KATHY Kick the bedroom door in. 

00:28:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You kicked the bedroom? 

00:28:45
KATHY Yeah. Sure. 

00:28:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. You mean the bedroom door was locked? 

00:28:50
TIFFANY No. 

00:28:55
KATHY No. 

00:28:55
TIFFANY There's holes in all the doors. 

00:28:55
KATHY Then we won't have any problems with the bedroom door anymore. 

00:28:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? Have you been able to spell your name in the door with the kicks? 

00:29:00
KATHY With the kicks? 

00:29:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:29:00
KATHY Well, I, I usually rotate, I go between doors and walls and chairs. 

00:29:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Okay. 

00:29:05
TIFFANY Yeah, we throw the chairs in the doors. 

00:29:05
KATHY Right. 

00:29:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So it sounds like, uh, there's, it runs in the genes here, huh? 

00:29:10
KATHY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:29:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So the anger sometimes gets the best of you, too? 

00:29:10
KATHY Yes. 

00:29:15
TIFFANY Not usually, though. 

00:29:15
KATHY Yeah, it takes a while. 

00:29:15
TIFFANY She's usually pretty calm. She'll be like, "Stop it, guys, stop it!" 

00:29:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right, so she comes in and says that, and then how do you respond to those? 

00:29:25
TIFFANY I close the door and they keep coming back in and 

00:29:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is that when the kicking starts? 

00:29:25
TIFFANY Actually, it starts after, then they do that and then she goes in her room, shuts the door, then they all come, like, knocking on her door every five seconds and then she starts screaming and kicking and Lord Almighty. 

00:29:35
KATHY And meanwhile we have the colicky six-month-old who's been screaming for approximately eight hours at this point. 

00:29:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. Oh, God. So no, like, reprieve, no breaks. 

00:29:45
KATHY No. 

00:29:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. All right, so. All right, so then what happens after that? I mean, you know, does she chill out or, what, you know, once you get involved? 

00:29:55
KATHY Once I get crazy and kick things over and act like a lunatic, then everybody starts acting right. 

00:30:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:30:00
KATHY And then I go, I shut the door, I take a couple of Zanex and then we all go on like everything's fine and Dad fixes the door. 

00:30:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:30:10
KATHY Or he doesn't. 

00:30:10
TIFFANY Yeah. 

00:30:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Does, does, uh, he ever get involved in this whole dance? 

00:30:15
TIFFANY Oh, God. 

00:30:15
KATHY He's worse than all of us put together. 

00:30:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Does he fly off the handle? 

00:30:15
TIFFANY Usually starts it with me. That's, it starts from him to me and then, 

00:30:20
KATHY Then I take the baton and then me and him start fighting. 

00:30:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:30:20
KATHY Because he's acting like a lunatic to the kids. I mean, I can do it, but he can't do it. 

00:30:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:30:30
KATHY But I do it differently. I don't lash out at them. 

00:30:30
TIFFANY He's ridiculous. 

00:30:30
KATHY I don't verbally abuse them. I, I do walls and doors and that's it, you know? 

00:30:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:30:35
KATHY And I just take the house down. I don't try to take them down. You know, I don't know what's in that man. 

00:30:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Have you ever thought about pursuing a career in construction? I see you're like, in one of those crazes, and throwing the ball at the building! 

00:30:50
KATHY Yeah, and destroying the walls. I've always liked that idea, yeah. That might be a good thing! 

00:30:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And do you get along with your stepdad pretty good or? 

00:31:00
TIFFANY Lately we've been straight, but for the most part, no. 

00:31:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. What's been happening lately that's helped you get along? 

00:31:05
TIFFANY He stopped being mean to me. And he said that he'll relate to me and he's like, being nice and my mom's like, me and my mom get in a fight, I can go to him then. But before I would be, me and my mom would get in a fight and then me and him would get in a fight. 

00:31:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So it's like tag-team wrestling. 

00:31:20
TIFFANY Yeah, especially with him 'cuz we always fight all the time. 

00:31:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. 

00:31:20
TIFFANY For like, eight or nine years, we'd just fight every day. I can't even be by him. 

00:31:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Huh. And so what, how did you get that to happen where you guys have been able to make sort of peace? 

00:31:30
TIFFANY He did it, I don't know. I stayed away from him and then he just all of a sudden decided to be like that. But then some days he'll be like, screaming at me and then five minutes later he'll be like, fine and it's weird. But he's doing better now. Before, I mean, he was just screaming at me every time I walked in the door. 

00:31:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN That's great. Can you, have you seen him, have you seen her do anything differently around Brian that's helped them get along better? 

00:31:55
KATHY She's learned how to keep her mouth shut. 

00:32:00
TIFFANY Yeah, we've had a couple experiences with me and him. 

00:32:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. What do you, what do you do, bite your tongue or, how do you keep your mouth shut? 

00:32:05
TIFFANY Well, I've learned that I don't wanna get grounded off the phone so I just. 

00:32:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Oh, that's a very important thing. Your whole social life. Yeah. That's great. Well, let me ask you guys a fun question. Let's say tonight you go home and while you're sound asleep a miracle happens, and this problem is completely solved. It's no longer an issue, this anger and this bitterness and out-of-control stuff. Um, and, and things have changed the way you want them to. What would be in each of your miracle pictures the next day when you wake up? 

00:32:40
TIFFANY I don't know. I wouldn't. I don't know. It would be weird because it wouldn't be the same as it always is and so I wouldn't know what I would want 'cuz I can't react well to peace. It just doesn't work right with me. 

00:32:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You're not used to it. 

00:32:55
TIFFANY No. 

00:32:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, what, what else might be there that will help you feel better about things at home? 

00:33:05
TIFFANY A lock on my door that works. 

00:33:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Has that been a problem, that you haven't been able to sort of keep people out? 

00:33:10
TIFFANY Yeah, 'cuz I can't lock my door. 

00:33:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:33:10
TIFFANY And the kids, they don't really care. 

00:33:15
KATHY And why can't we lock our door? 

00:33:15
TIFFANY 'Cuz I'm not trusted. 

00:33:15
KATHY That's not exactly true. 

00:33:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I got a question about that. Once you have that lock on that door, what difference will that make for you in terms of how you get along with other people? 

00:33:25
TIFFANY I don't have to come out there anymore. 

00:33:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So you can have your privacy, huh? Okay. What would you be the most surprised with, a change with your mom when you wake up the next day after the miracle happens? What would you see her doing differently? 

00:33:40
TIFFANY Not much. She's always up at like, the crack of dawn doing everything to make everyone happy so I, I don't know. If it was different, she'd be like, up throwing pots and pans at people and stuff. 

00:33:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. Would she be doing anything, um, um, anything new that might be making you feel happier? 

00:34:00
TIFFANY Yeah, she'd be putting a phone line in my room. 

00:34:00
KATHY Oh, yeah right! 

00:34:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Okay. What about if, if we had, uh, Brian sitting here and I asked him the same question, this miracle's happened, what would he notice first that changed, let's say, in your relationship together? 

00:34:15
TIFFANY That we can talk. 

00:34:20
KATHY What would be his idea of a miracle between her and our relationship? 

00:34:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:34:25
KATHY That, um, I would stop st-, sticking up for her all the time and that I would step back further from the friendship role and more into the mother role, even though he would say that I've done better over the years. 

00:34:40
TIFFANY Which shouldn't happen. 

00:34:40
KATHY Well, what should happen? It's balance. It's balance and moderation, you know what I mean? 

00:34:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So you, you miss the, the days when Mom was down with, more down on your level? 

00:34:50
TIFFANY Yeah, 'cuz he just comes in and runs everything. It's like, no one asked you to come here. 

00:34:55
KATHY She was, you know, she would sleep with me then, before we were married. 

00:35:00
TIFFANY I was little. 

00:35:00
KATHY When she first came back. She was with her biological father for two years. And then she came back 

00:35:05
TIFFANY He really was a crackhead then, though. 

00:35:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. He was doing coke? 

00:35:05
TIFFANY He was doing something. I dunno what he was doing. He was doing a lot of different stuff. 

00:35:10
KATHY She went to him a lot for a couple, three, four years. Those first five years she had a really hard time and I'm a firm believer in those first five years and I can see throughout my children and the different stages in my life and where I was when I started in the different stages of their life and how they are. 

00:35:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What else would be in this miracle picture with this family? How else would things have changed? 

00:35:30
KATHY Everybody'd just love each other. 

00:35:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. How would they show that? 

00:35:35
KATHY By helping each other. By being concerned about other people. It's like everybody being concerned about them, just themselves. Every single person being concerned about themselves, except for me, who runs around, making peace and doing everything they can to try and make everybody in the house happy. And they're all miserable still! 

00:35:55
TIFFANY But if we were all happy, you wouldn't have to do that anymore. 

00:35:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So it sounds like the harder you try, the more miserable they get. 

00:36:00
KATHY Yeah. 

00:36:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:36:00
KATHY Mm-hmm. That's it. 

00:36:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right. I'm curious, are there any pieces of the miracle happening a little bit now? 

00:36:10
TIFFANY I don't know about that. I dunno. The kids, they're still little brats, but my dad's getting better at not snapping at some of us all the time. 

00:36:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You're talking about Brian. 

00:36:20
TIFFANY Yeah, I don't see my other dad. 

00:36:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:36:25
TIFFANY But like, there's some of us he won't do anything about, like Scarlet. She can go around, she can kill someone and she wouldn't get in trouble for it. If I even touch that little girl, I'm in so much trouble. And like, I, me and my brother, Ryan, we can't do anything without getting yelled at, especially Ryan. And he has problems 'cuz he has ADD. So he's like, always hyper and, dude, he gets snapped at so much and it's just wrong. 

00:36:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. 

00:36:50
TIFFANY If I say anything then it all comes to me, so I'm just gonna stay out of it. 

00:36:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN If we thought of some of the other kids were and I asked them the same question about the miracle, what, what might they say that they would notice that change with this family situation for the better? 

00:37:05
TIFFANY They wouldn't have to clean their room. That's what, that's the only thing they'd be able to think of. 

00:37:05
KATHY Do you think so? 

00:37:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Oh, who'd do, who'd be doing that? 

00:37:10
TIFFANY Mom. 

00:37:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mom would do all their rooms? 

00:37:15
KATHY I have to do everything. 

00:37:15
TIFFANY She does it anyway. For like, the first time in their life they have to do it and they're all upset. 

00:37:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. So there'd be real clean rooms and Mom would, would you be so tired cleaning all those rooms that you wouldn't be able to kick holes in doors? 

00:37:30
KATHY No. 

00:37:30
TIFFANY She, she does that now. 

00:37:30
KATHY And I should be able to play games and, you know, um. 

00:37:35
TIFFANY She cleans the whole house and everyone's room. 

00:37:35
KATHY Sit with each one of 'em every day, plus clean the rooms and do the laundry. 

00:37:40
TIFFANY And she hasn't kicked in any doors since like, couple months ago. Doing good about that. 

00:37:45
KATHY That's my medication. It's called medication. 

00:37:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is that the Zanex doing it? 

00:37:45
KATHY It's the Zanex. 

00:37:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Ah, there's gotta be, there's gotta be other things. Like, are you telling yourself anything that seems to be helpful? Avoid the temptation? 

00:37:55
TIFFANY Don't kick the door? 

00:37:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. What else are you doing to avoid losing it like that? 

00:37:55
KATHY This too will pass. This too will pass. That's about it. You know, the colicky baby is like the icing on the cake at this point. I'm, I've really thought about getting on a plane and just going away. 

00:38:10
TIFFANY But she wouldn't do that to us. 

00:38:10
KATHY No, I wouldn't do it. But I do think about it. 

00:38:15
TIFFANY 'Cuz she knows we'd all kill each other, literally. 

00:38:15
KATHY Yeah, you would. 

00:38:15
TIFFANY I'd run away. 

00:38:15
KATHY The whole place would just combust. 

00:38:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Has there, has there been times where Tiffany has, you know, pitched in and helped you out with some of those responsibilities? 

00:38:25
KATHY When she needs something. 

00:38:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Like the phone line and. 

00:38:25
KATHY Money. 

00:38:25
TIFFANY Money. 

00:38:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. 

00:38:30
KATHY Rides. 

00:38:30
TIFFANY I'm nice sometimes, though. If you catch me on those good days when I don't get in trouble at school then I'm nice sometimes. Occasionally. You have to admit, there are some periods I'm nice. 

00:38:40
KATHY Oh, you are nice. You're a lovely girl. You are. 

00:38:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Let me, let me ask you guys a question. Um, just to get a sense of where we've been and where we're at today, on a scale from one to ten, ten being, you know, no blow-ups, um, better control the anger, and one, the total pits, you know, total outta control stuff. Where were things, you know, like a month ago would you say? 

00:39:10
TIFFANY I dunno. Why do I always have answer everything first? 

00:39:10
KATHY I, you know, it seems like a rollercoaster to me is what it seems like. I, if you, if you told me to try to pinpoint or, or, it seems like a rollercoaster to me. One day 

00:39:20
TIFFANY It depends which kid you're talking about. Like, with Kathleen, if my mom's gone for more than an hour in one, like, month and she's a total disaster. 

00:39:30
KATHY An emotional wreck. 

00:39:30
TIFFANY 'Cuz she's like, attached to her. 

00:39:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:39:30
TIFFANY By the hip or something. It's ridiculous. And with Scarlet, if my mom's gone then she's happy because she's with her dad and there's no one to discipline her then. 

00:39:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Just play around with, just an estimate. Where, where would you have seen things, let's say, in the past, a month or two. On that scale, ten is the best, one is the pits. 

00:39:50
KATHY I'd say about a, um, 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
KATHY Four. 

00:40:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN About four? Okay. How about now? 

00:40:05
KATHY Maybe a five, but that's only because my husband's laid off from work and because he's acting differently because he's, he's not under the stress of work. 

00:40:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:40:15
TIFFANY And he wants to sleep in the same room, too. He doesn't wanna sleep on the couch. 

00:40:20
KATHY Right. That's what I'm saying. 

00:40:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sleep in the same room with you. 

00:40:20
KATHY Yeah. 

00:40:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:40:20
KATHY It's bad enough that he's laid off from work, you know what I mean? 

00:40:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sure. 

00:40:25
KATHY So, uh, he's just, he's been doing, he's been trying a lot harder. 

00:40:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. And you think that's been really helpful to Tiffany? 

00:40:35
KATHY Yes. 

00:40:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:40:35
KATHY Right. 

00:40:35
TIFFANY 'Cuz he's like our dad now. Before he was just like a prison guard or something. "Oh boy, I get to go home and get yelled at." 

00:40:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Have you, have you let him know that? 

00:40:40
TIFFANY No. 

00:40:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN That he's become more of a dad for you? 

00:40:45
TIFFANY Yeah, I've told him that, but, I mean, it's not real easy to express any kind of emotion with him 'cuz he's like, emotionless. 'Cuz, I don't know, he's strange. 

00:40:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. All right. Um, I'd like to meet a little with mom for just a little bit, and then you and I'll have a little bit of alone time too. So if we can just take a little mini-break and, um, they'll escort you. 

00:41:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, I've heard some things that you've mentioned that seem to be helpful. Um, and, and it's, it was really beautiful the way you could see that dance that the harder you try to sort of be the peacekeeper here and take charge of the situation the more it blows up. 

00:41:30
KATHY Why is that? That makes no common sense to me. 

00:41:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, it's really interesting to me. You know, we were talking about teenagers, that, I've seen this a lot, that parents, the more super-responsible they are, you know, and trying to save their kids and trying to get them to be responsible, the more irresponsible their kids are. 

00:41:50
KATHY Okay, because I have friends that totally neglect their kids and that lady I was counseling before, totally neglected her kids and was on drugs, these kids were the best kids and they were brilliant and they could, they were self-motivated. And I'm thinking, this is what you have to do? You have to neglect your children to get them to be the way, this makes no sense to me. It's the opposite of what should happen. 

00:42:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:42:10
KATHY So what do you do? You don't wanna neglect them, I mean, that's obviously not the thing to do. 

00:42:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. You know, I, it, I wonder if you contribute to Brian's sort of turning things around here, you know, with Tiffany because it seems to me that Tiffany really has warmed up to him more since he has made some changes. 

00:42:35
KATHY Yeah, he's 

00:42:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Have you been part of that, helping him be more? 

00:42:35
KATHY You know, I try. 

00:42:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Different with her? 

00:42:35
KATHY I try, but he, uh, he's very, uh, headstrong and he knows everything. And he is a very intelligent man. I mean, and he does know quite a bit, but he doesn't know a lot about the heart. So that's where I try to help him. Um, he knows how much she means to me and he knows that we're right, it's, it's, it's, something's gonna happen, either right, at this point we're at a threshold. Either she's gonna make the step and she's gonna go on and she's gonna be successful or she's, well, she's gonna go down and God knows how many years it's gonna take her if she ever pulls out of it. 

00:43:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:43:15
KATHY And, uh. 

00:43:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN She's very bright, very, very perceptive. And, you know, after hearing the situation with her biological father, feeling, maybe at times, rejected, um, this relationship is very special. 

00:43:30
KATHY Right. 

00:43:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh, this relationship with Brian. And I think the more you can help him see how important this is, that they have that connection. 'Cuz that's what kids want today. They need to feel connected. You know, there's all these beliefs and all this stuff written about, you know, all teenagers want is independence and their freedom. You know, there's all this research that's been done that's saying that these kids wanna be able to connect with their parents. They need that. 

00:44:00
KATHY Right. 

00:44:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN That's what helps them, it safeguards them from getting into self-destructive behaviors. 

00:44:05
KATHY Right. 

00:44:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know? And it seems like Tiffany is at a pretty good place right now and I think that part of that is what Brian's doing. 

00:44:15
KATHY Okay. 

00:44:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN But I'm wondering if there's other things that you've been doing that has helped her, you know, maybe chill out more, you know, not fly off the handle. 

00:44:20
KATHY I've told her to watch me. 

00:44:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Be more responsible. 

00:44:25
KATHY When, because I try to tell her that people are who they are and we can't change who they are, so we need to learn how it is to react to how they, they say things to us. He says things in a whole different way than I say things and a lot of times it really sounds hurtful or it really sounds powerful and it, you know, it's pushy and, and she's the kind of person that needs to jump back up. And I used to be too and I think that's why God put this person in my life so I can learn how, how to, to moderate that. You know, and to me it's just not worth jumping back up and being ignorant. I'll just let him get out whatever it is he has to say, sometimes I won't say anything, or sometimes I'll say something very profound that, that'll just shut him up because he really can't. But if you jump back up at, at him in anger and then he's just ready to go. You know? He's just, that's what he's looking for most of the time. He wants three or four hours of rounds with an intellectual mindscrew and, you know, it, and that's what I've told her. Just don't go there. Just, yeah, I know that it's aggravating you, but if you just don't go there, then it'll be over. "Okay, Dad, I understand." 

00:45:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. And the other thing that you've identified which is really beautiful because I think a lot of times parents don't see the patterns. But you see another pattern and that is the domino effect. That if one flies off the handle, they all fly off the handle. And then if you fly off the handle, then they even escalate more. 

00:45:50
KATHY Yeah. 

00:45:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So that you and Brian are really significant in guiding them to a better place, helping them learn how to settle down and chill out. 

00:46:05
KATHY And have the self-control and, and, and 

00:46:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And that's what you have to model for them. 

00:46:10
KATHY Right. 

00:46:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And as consistently as possible. 

00:46:15
KATHY Consistency. 

00:46:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Because if you're flying off the handle, kicking holes in doors and this and that, that's what they're picking up. That this is the way you solve problems. 

00:46:20
KATHY Exactly. 

00:46:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And, and I think you have that insight, you know, it's just a matter of putting it into practice on a regular basis. 

00:46:30
KATHY Right. You know, and, and it's, I can do it when, I can do it even under duress, but on the fifth day of no sleep, it's 6:00 after four hours of, you know, homework and the baby screaming for eight hours during the day, it's just like, I just lose it. 

00:46:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You have to find the balance. 

00:46:50
KATHY Right. 

00:46:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I'm wondering, have there been any times, any days, where you felt like you had the balance, where you were taking, spending a little bit of time taking care of yourself? And not just kid-centered, you know? 

00:47:05
KATHY I know, and when I do do that, I'm eat up with guilt. Eat up with guilt. You know, like this whole Opera thing. It was such a blessing that, that they took me and they did all this for me, but the whole time I couldn't help but think, you shouldn't be here, your husband's laid off, he's stuck with the kids, you're acting like you're a queen. And, and then you can't even enjoy the time that you get because you're, you feel like you're the bad mom. You know, you shouldn't be doing this. You should've sent the kids up to their room or you should've, you know, you should've done something else. This isn't what you need to be doing. So I, it's hard to take. And, and that's it. When I force the time and I force the issue, then I feel bad. So it's like wasted time anyhow so I figure I'll just wait another 18 years and, you know, then I'll have some time. 

00:47:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Outside of, of allowing yourself to be pampered on the Opera Show, um, have there been other times at all? Can you think of any times in the past where you said, "You know what, I need the, I need a time-out. I need to do something good for me." 

00:48:05
KATHY Um, no. Since the baby's been born, uh, starting at about four months, I told Brian he had to take her one night a week because it'd gotten to the point where I was hallucinating from not sleeping for six days. I mean, it was nuts. 

00:48:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:48:20
KATHY Really crazy stuff. And I said, "You're gonna take her one night a week." So now that he's laid off, he does that favor for me. 

00:48:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN He calls it a favor? 

00:48:30
KATHY Two nights a week. 

00:48:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:48:30
KATHY And you know, I think in my mind, the demon-spawn children that are in my family are Scarlet and Faith, that's the last two that we've had together. And sometimes I think, you know, it'd be easier to just pick up and leave those three because they're really high-maintenance. And they really drive me nuts and they really think differently. He thinks really differently than me and Scarlet is just like him. And she does this mindscrew with me already and she's only 6 years old. Real thinker. Einstein-ish kind of stuff, you know? 

00:49:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, I wanted to throw this out. You know, we were talking before about responsibility. She's getting older and there's a maturity about her, um, that, that I like. And she wants her own phone line. Is there any way that we could have her take on maybe some more responsibilities around the house? 

00:49:30
KATHY In order for her to get? 

00:49:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So that she can earn the privilege of getting that. 

00:49:35
KATHY Now that might be a possibility. And we could probably start with her earning, um, the $59 from last month's phone bill where she did the three-way calling 69 times in a three, in a 30-day period. 

00:49:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 69 times? Wow. 

00:49:50
KATHY 69 times on our budget. Yeah. So, yeah, and I think that'd be a really good stepping stone to start with. First let's see if you can earn the money to earn this off and then if you want to add on more responsibilities, like you do to earn that, then we can start working on a phone line for you. 

00:50:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN See, I think, even though she's getting older and she has her own independent life, she also recognizes that "I need to help out." You know, she sees that there are things going on, it's pretty chaotic, and I don't think she likes when she sees you in a place where you're flying off the handle. 

00:50:25
KATHY Right. 

00:50:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, so I think we should give her, you know, these kind of opp-, growth opportunities. 

00:50:30
KATHY Okay. 

00:50:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, take responsibility so that she can earn things that she wants. 

00:50:35
KATHY Okay. 

00:50:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Which is character-building. 

00:50:40
KATHY So instead of saying, "You have to go in and clean the bathroom today," you approach it in saying, what? Help me. 

00:50:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, if there're, if she has a couple of chores, I would, I would give options. You know, which would you prefer to do first, the bathroom or the closet in the bedroom or under the bed or whatever. So if they do something, at least they're doing something. 

00:51:00
KATHY Right. And then they're making the choice. 

00:51:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. That also creates something along the lines of if she wants to earn the extra phone line, having a phone in her room, maybe there's some ways that she can earn that money so that she can make that happen. 

00:51:10
KATHY Okay. Okay. 

00:51:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And that, that, that teaches her a very valuable life lesson. 

00:51:15
KATHY But now, you would have to agree that even though she has the phone line in her room, the phone rules would still remain. I mean, I, I can't allow her to lay up 3:00 in the morning talking on the phone. 

00:51:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. There's got to be some guidelines. 

00:51:25
KATHY Right. 

00:51:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Absolutely. Right. And that's where you guys can compromise. She's getting what she wants, but there's gotta be guidelines attached to it, otherwise it's not a done deal. 

00:51:35
KATHY Right. Okay. 

00:51:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, was there anything else, um, I'm just trying to look for other options for you. You know, okay, you have Brian taking the kids two nights, but do you have, uh, like a pal or some friends, uh, that you could maybe go out with for 

00:51:50
KATHY I, I don't have any friends. 

00:51:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You don't have any? 

00:51:55
KATHY I know it sounds so sad, doesn't it? Oh, God. It's not that bad. Actually I met one friend when I was up there, one of the girls who I did the makeover with, and she's like from Joliette so it's not too far and we're kinda talking about getting together every once in a while. 

00:52:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Good. 

00:52:05
KATHY And, and it'll be something I just have to, like everything else, like brownies, I'll just have to say, no, you know, I, this is a plan and I have to go and 

00:52:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Good for you. 

00:52:15
KATHY I'm gonna force myself to do it because, yeah, I do realize that, 'cuz even in the bathtub, they're all banging on the door. "Mommy, Mommy." "Are you done yet? Are you done?" "Is that a candle, Mommy? Is that a candle? I'm looking under the door," you know? It's like, ah. 

00:52:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. And let me just say that you deserve your own space time. You have to, in order for you to be fit for a fight as a parent. 

00:52:40
KATHY Right. 

00:52:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN In a positive sense, you have to take care of yourself too. 

00:52:45
KATHY Yes. 

00:52:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And find that balance. 

00:52:45
KATHY Right. That is the hardest thing, is balance. 

00:52:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You deserve it. And I really appreciate the fact that you were able to assert yourself with Brian and say, "Look, take them two nights." 

00:52:55
KATHY Right. 

00:52:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Free yourself up. 

00:53:00
KATHY That's not a bad thing, right? 

00:53:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:53:00
KATHY I mean, people do need sleep. 

00:53:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You do need to do that. 

00:53:00
KATHY I need sleep. 

00:53:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN If you brought this child and you help bring this child. 

00:53:05
KATHY That's right. 

00:53:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:53:05
KATHY Yes. 

00:53:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right. I wanna meet with Tiffany a little more for a little bit, so if you can send her in. 

00:53:10
KATHY All right. 

00:53:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And then we'll take a little mini-break and then we'll wrap it up. 

00:53:15
KATHY Okay. 

00:53:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 'Kay? Yeah. Thank you. 

00:53:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So I wanted to find out from you how I can be helpful to you. Um, if there's one thing that, let's say, that Mom does that really ticks you off the most. 

00:53:25
TIFFANY Not really. 

00:53:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN That you'd like to see changed. 

00:53:30
TIFFANY Not really. Me and my mom are pretty straight. 

00:53:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? 

00:53:35
TIFFANY When she goes along with my dad I hate it, but, uh. 

00:53:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? 

00:53:35
TIFFANY We're pretty straight for the most part. 

00:53:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, you mentioned earlier that you would love to have your own phone line and your own phone in your room. And I, and I'd really like to see that happen. 

00:53:45
TIFFANY I had my own phone line in my room, but I got in trouble. 

00:53:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Why, 'cuz you ran up big bills or? 

00:53:50
TIFFANY Yeah, I had supposedly made 69 three-way calls. And I had just gotten it back in my room then so then they took it out again. 

00:54:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is that, is that the number one thing on your list that you'd like to have back? 

00:54:05
TIFFANY Yup. 

00:54:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. You know, I was talking to your mom about that and I was saying to her that I thought that was a good idea. And now that you're getting older and you're more responsible, 

00:54:15
TIFFANY Well it just happened like, last week. 

00:54:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. So, I guess what I wanted to, to see if you'd be willing to do this because she's willing to work with you on this. Um, and that is that if there are certain things that you could do to help out to earn money so that you can be able to pay for this. And 

00:54:40
TIFFANY I can get a job next year and then I can just get my own line in there. 

00:54:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, but she has some ideas about things you might be able to do 

00:54:45
TIFFANY I don't like working for them. 

00:54:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You don't? 

00:54:45
TIFFANY I mean, we do all this big stuff, they'll be like, okay, I'll clean out the whole basement and I'll give you 50 cents. It's like, not really. 

00:54:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What if we were able to come up with some little things as ways to earn money? Would you be willing to work with your mom on that? 

00:55:00
TIFFANY Mm-hmm. 

00:55:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right, help me out. What things will you at all costs be, refuse to do versus what things would you be willing to do as the little things to earn money. 

00:55:10
TIFFANY Only thing I won't do is pick up after that dog. 

00:55:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:55:15
TIFFANY I don't care what else I do. 

00:55:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, no use of the poopy scooper. 

00:55:20
TIFFANY No, I don't like that. 

00:55:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

00:55:20
TIFFANY I mean, I'll change the baby and all that kind of stuff, I don't care about that. 

00:55:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How, how are you doing with that? Do you like doing that? 

00:55:25
TIFFANY The baby's straight. She's cool 'cuz you can talk to her and she doesn't talk back. 

00:55:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. Is there anything else that, that we haven't talked about that's going on in your life, um, that you really, um, you know, wanted to talk about or 

00:55:45
TIFFANY I don't know. What did my mom tell you? 

00:55:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Your mom hasn't told me anything. 

00:55:45
TIFFANY She didn't tell you anything bad about me? 

00:55:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No. 

00:55:50
TIFFANY Well, I'm surprised. 

00:55:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What would be, what? 

00:55:50
TIFFANY I don't know. I've done a lot of bad things lately and. 

00:55:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Like what? 

00:56:00
TIFFANY Like I seen couple older guys and gotten in trouble for it and a lot of bad things like that. 

00:56:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Were these guys that your friends introduced you to or, how did you? 

00:56:10
TIFFANY Because I was waiting for someone behind a store and I met this dude's brother but they lied to me about their age. I didn't know how old they really were. And then I found out and I still didn't do anything about it and my mom found out. But I would just meet people up at the store where I always was and. 

00:56:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You mean you used to work at that store? 

00:56:30
TIFFANY No, just me and my friends would always go up there 'cuz there was a lot of people up there. I would see them and I'd talk, start talking to them and then we'd just become good friends. 

00:56:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And so now that they know that you're seeing these older guys are they trying to prevent you from that or? 

00:56:40
TIFFANY 'Cuz I haven't seen them for like a couple months now so it's straight, but. 

00:56:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Um, no, she didn't even mention that. 

00:56:55
TIFFANY I'm surprised. 

00:56:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

00:56:55
TIFFANY She tells everyone. 

00:56:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, the, I think the, the biggie on her list was, um, you know, flying, when you get mad and shoot somebody's head off when they come into your 

00:57:05
TIFFANY Well, they start something with me first. 

00:57:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:57:05
TIFFANY I don't just get mad for no reason. 

00:57:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:57:10
TIFFANY Like she's saying that like, you can say hi to me and I'm gonna like, come at you with a knife or something. If someone does something to me, I'm gonna say something about it and she knows that. And they just try to antagonize me. Like, when she loses her clothes, she be like, "Tiffany, where's my skirt?" "I don't have your skirt," and then she don't believe me and she'll look through my whole room and she'll feel really stupid when she finds it downstairs and she won't even apologize for it. They all just assume I'm some bad person who does things just to make them mad, but I don't. 

00:57:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, is there any, um, do you have any ideas for me that you think would be helpful for me to share with your mom about things that she should do that could help her be less, 'cuz it sounds like Mom gets really stressed out with all these kids and the baby crying all the time. Is there any, any things that you have that you think could be helpful for her to know? 

00:58:00
TIFFANY Not that I can think of. 

00:58:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Help her be less stressed out? 

00:58:00
TIFFANY I dunno. I think she should just, if she feels stressed, she should just leave for like, a couple hours or go somewhere so that she doesn't have to be around it. Maybe like have a babysitter or my dad or something. But she shouldn't stay at the house all the time like she does 'cuz that's not gonna help her at all. 

00:58:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Would that be something you be willing to do to sort of help her out and take over for a little bit? 

00:58:20
TIFFANY Yeah. Yeah, and she knows that and like, when she goes to her room I try to keep the kids out, but they don't listen to me. And I'm not allowed to hit them. If I hit them, they'd listen to me. 

00:58:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

00:58:30
TIFFANY But I'll get in trouble if I do that. 

00:58:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. That's a great idea. Any other ideas? 

00:58:35
TIFFANY That's all I can think of. 

00:58:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, I was, I wanna back up to something that you were talking about earlier and that is that you and your stepfather seem to be getting along better now. And is that something that, um, you kinda wanna build off of with him? I mean, would you like to see this relationship grow and continue to get better or? 

00:59:00
TIFFANY I guess, but it's kinda weird 'cuz I just know if I do one thing wrong, he's just gonna blow up, man. 'Cuz it's like he's being so nice like he wants something and he's just waiting for me to mess up. So I don't really want to just blow off in one time, just keep doing it a little at a time instead of one big time. 

00:59:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And are you, I mean you mentioned earlier that, that he just is there, but it's hard to like, talk with him about like, share that with him 'cuz you're not, yeah. 

00:59:30
TIFFANY He is big and strong. 

00:59:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is he? 

00:59:30
TIFFANY Yeah, he scares me, man. 

00:59:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What kind of work was he doing before? 

00:59:35
TIFFANY He was doing some kind of cable, I don't know, something like that. 

00:59:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So he's a big guy. 

00:59:40
TIFFANY He's like, really skinny, but he's tall and he does not look strong, but he is very strong. And I know he would never hit me and if he did it would only be like, spanked, you know, but shouldn't do it in the first place 'cuz I'm entirely too old for that. But I mean, he just scares me 'cuz I know that he could have the potential of hurting me, just from seeing how big he is. And plus, I don't wanna make him mad 'cuz I gotta live in his house. 

01:00:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. Is him in the house more, uh, less like, chaotic? One of your goals too that you'd like to have less like, fighting and yelling and. 

01:00:20
TIFFANY I guess. 

01:00:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? 

01:00:20
TIFFANY Yeah, 'cuz then I could actually like, not have to hear everyone. That'd be cool. 

01:00:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is there, is there anything that, as a leader in this family because you're like, the oldest, pretty much, is there anything that you think you could do that could help, help with that situation in any way? 

01:00:40
TIFFANY Just not start stuff with them. That's all I can do. Which is hard 'cuz they're little brats. 

01:00:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Are there, ha-, have there been any times lately where you were tempted to like, start something up but you held back and did something else instead? 

01:00:55
TIFFANY Couple of times today. 

01:00:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What kinds of things did you do? 

01:01:00
TIFFANY I would just go in my room, turn my music up. I wouldn't have to think about them anymore. 

01:01:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Anything else? Okay. All right, well, thank you, and we're just gonna take a little tiny break and then, um, I'm gonna have you both come back in here and we'll wrap up. See you in a little bit. 

01:01:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN First of all, I'd like to start by saying, um, how courageous you guys are, your willingness to come down here and, uh, takes a lot of courage to do this and, um, and there were some thoughts I had after you left that I wanted to share with you, some things that I was very impressed with with the two of you. Um, first of all, Kathy, um, what was so amazing about you is your insightfulness. I work with a lot of parents that are just so stuck that they don't sort of step back and take a look at what's happening before their eyes, but they just throw themselves in there and then lose it and they lose sight of what they're trying to do. 

01:01:55
KATHY Right. 

01:01:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And it's clear to me that you recognize that the more you go in, throw yourself into the situation without having control, the more out of control everybody else gets and how important it is that you have to sort of be like the leader and take control, um, and be in control. And, and that should help slow things down and help things be less chaotic. 

01:02:20
KATHY Okay. 

01:02:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, you also recognize a lot of Tiffany's strengths: that she's responsible and mature and can be a big help to you and, and also you notice this budding relationship with, with Brian which is really significant. I mean, this is a nice, it's sort of like a second chance, you know, that there's rough going with Dad, but now you have the opportunity to build a positive relationship with another father figure. Um, and the other thing that I really liked too is that in recognizing her responsible behavior and her ability to really take responsibility and, and help out, that perhaps we can build into this whole situation opportunities for her to earn money so that she can have the kinds of things that she wants. 

01:03:15
KATHY Right. 

01:03:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I did check that out with her and she did say that there would be some things that she'd be willing to do to, to earn the privileges that she wants, having the phone line, stuff like that. And perhaps that's something that the two of you can work on together. 

01:03:30
KATHY Okay. 

01:03:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, and that you also need to find a balance in your life. And you're already starting to do that. You know, you got your friend down south that you've been talking about and you're gonna get together with. 

01:03:40
KATHY Right. 

01:03:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, giving yourself two nights of freedom from only one, having Brian take over. I think that's really important. 

01:03:45
KATHY Okay. 

01:03:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Gotta have that balance. It just can't be all work and no play. 

01:03:50
KATHY Right. 

01:03:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, and Tiffany, um, I gotta tell you, I got blown off a lot, you know, like, kids refuse to come in and the only person that shows up might be Mom. And the fact that you are willing to come down here tonight and, um, and expose me to all of your wonderful qualities I think, uh 

01:04:10
TIFFANY Well, I wasn't told that it videotaped, but, you know. 

01:04:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:04:10
TIFFANY I'm still stuck on that. 

01:04:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, and, and I was really impressed with how creative and mature you are and, and, and some of her ideas. Um, I asked her, you know, if she had any advice for me to kind of share with you that, things that she thinks you could do that could help out with this stressful, chaotic situation. 

01:04:30
KATHY Right, right. 

01:04:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN She said that, you know, I'd be willing to sort of take over and watch the little one and, and free Mom up so that she can take care of herself for a couple hours. And I thought that was really beautiful. 

01:04:45
KATHY Yes. 

01:04:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN A lot of daughters, you know, a lot of kids her age would say, "I don't have time," you know, "I'm with my friends," or "I'm busy, I'm chilling, I don't, don't mess with me." And her willingness to want to pitch in and to help you out. 

01:04:55
KATHY She's a good girl. She's a precious girl. She really is. 

01:05:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, and the other thing that I like too about you, Tiffany, was that I asked you, you know, what are some things that you do to chill out and you had some really good ideas. You know, going in your room and cranking up the music, um, you know, just taking yourself away from the situation that's making you upset and really trying not to make waves with Brian. That on some level you see that this is a second chance and this is a nice opportunity to have a positive relationship with a father figure and not to rock the boat with him. And I thought that was really great. So I just wanna say that, you know, you guys remind me, I have a friend who has a sign in her office that says, for clients, it says, "Please solve your problems before you come in here so I can help you more." You guys, I mean you guys are so resourceful and you already know what you need to do, it's just doing more of it. 

01:05:50
KATHY Right. 

01:05:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And being consistent. 

01:05:55
KATHY And the consistency, yes. Yes. 

01:05:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So I don't wanna mess with a good thing so my recommendation to both of you is, um, keep track on a daily basis of the various things that you will do that will help get more order in this household and help you work together more as a team. 

01:06:10
KATHY Okay. 

01:06:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And what works. And keep doing more of that. Um, and I just wanted to ask you, what is your consultation fee if I, I actually have an alumni association of former kids that I've worked with who I like to have come in and help me out with other kids. You know, if I, I needed you to come in as an expert consultant, help me out with another girl just like you, same family situation. 

01:06:35
TIFFANY That's funny. 

01:06:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What would your consultation fee be? 

01:06:40
TIFFANY Oh, I'm not like that. I don't charge people for things. 

01:06:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You wouldn't charge for that? 

01:06:45
TIFFANY No. 

01:06:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. That's really generous of you. 'Cuz I think you can really help out a lot of people. And actually where I used to work we had a lot of teenager training programs and I bet you you'd be a, 

01:06:55
KATHY I think that would be 

01:06:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN A stellar leader. 

01:06:55
KATHY Yes. 

01:06:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:06:55
KATHY Yes. 

01:06:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yes. 

01:07:00
KATHY She's definitely a leader. 

01:07:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So on that note, um, I'd like to stop. Um, and I wish the two of you a lot of luck. And, uh, I think you're on the right track. 

01:07:10
KATHY Good. 

01:07:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And just keep pioneering this positive direction. 

01:07:15
KATHY Good, good. 

01:07:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay? 

01:07:15
KATHY Thank you. 

01:07:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right. 

01:07:15
KATHY Thank you very much. It's nice meeting you. 

01:07:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Nice meeting you. 

01:07:20
KATHY Have a great night. 

01:07:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:07:25
JON CARLSON In a minute we're gonna have a chance to look at some clips from the video that you just saw and have Matthew Selekman have the opportunity to make some comments. But before we do that, let's ask him whether or not this is a good example of the kind of therapy that you do. 

01:07:45
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

01:07:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, Jon, I think this is really, uh, um, a really nice example of my style of working with adolescents and their parents. Um, I want it to be a relaxed conversation. I want there to be some humor and some playfulness. I want people to feel like I'm bringing out the best in them. And this family had a lot of strengths and, and in many ways made my job easier. It made it much more, um, possible for me to, to more easily capitalize on their strengths and resources. 

01:08:15
JON CARLSON And you seemed to follow the set format that you talked about before. The idea, you joined with them. 

01:08:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. The first step is to establish a rapport and make them feel relaxed. 

01:08:25
JON CARLSON And you did that. 

01:08:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Invite them to talk about their strengths. And then move into, um, getting a clear picture from them about what they view as the right problem, where we need to begin first. And then I attempt to break that down into bite-sized pieces. And I might ask a question, uh, a videotape question about how things look when the problem happens. 

01:08:50
JON CARLSON What, why don't we start with that with our clips that we're gonna watch. In, in a moment we're gonna, you know, take some little segments out of the overall interview. And in this first one, it's about four min-, maybe a couple of minutes in actually, and you move right on with the question that's something like if this were to be a successful meeting, uh, what would happen? Could you talk about why you start with a question like that? 

01:09:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I'm trying to, not only as early as possible, uh, in the session, trying to get at, um, uh, essentially engender hope, um, that something positive is gonna happen in our meeting today. But at the same time I wanna know where they wanna be, um, when they have a successful outcome here. What number one difficulty, um, will be resolved or they'll have some helpful ideas to run with by the end of the session. 

01:09:40
JON CARLSON And that's what you see the therapist's job as doing is actually taking them to that place, giving them what they want? 

01:09:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, I, first of all, I wanna make sure that my clients are feeling satisfied as quickly as possible in terms of resolving their difficulties, but at the same time, hope is really important in, in therapy. Um, if we can at the very beginning get people more hopeful that they can get unstuck and something positive is gonna, uh, happen in our work together, um, I think that's empowering for clients. 

01:10:15
DIANE KJOS And they, they were very willing to come up with a, an idea. You know, the, the, uh, concern is when you ask that question, what if they really don't know or what if they have this sort of "everything's going to be perfect," then you need to spend more time with that I would assume. 

01:10:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Absolutely. Um, and, and then I would ask more questions to, to, um, to try and elicit as clearly as possible what in their minds, um, would be a small sign of progress, a small step in the right direction at this point to try and create a workable reality. 

01:10:50
JON CARLSON What, what about if, you know, again, these, I always worry about when people say "what if," but, a question would have come up like, "I would like Brian out of the house. That would be my goal. Mom shouldn't be with him and he shouldn't be in our lives." 

01:11:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And my comeback to that would be, you know, maybe for you at this point because things are kinda hot between the two of you, that would be nice. But what would be something smaller that we could focus our attention on at this point? Um, and to, again, to create a more workable solution. 

01:11:20
JON CARLSON So you validate her, but you don't necessarily go there. 

01:11:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

01:11:20
JON CARLSON Okay. Let's watch this first clip. 

01:11:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:11:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. All right, well, um, I guess I'd like to start off with my asking you, you know, if our meeting today proved to be helpful to you, um, what, what questions will you have had answered or what changes might have occurred that, um, you know, you driving off, you'd say, "Wow, you know, that was worthwhile?" 

01:11:50
KATHY Um, I would say, um, my biggest concern, the reason I'm here is that, that there seems to be a lot of anger and bitterness in Tiffany and, uh, I want her to be able to deal with that effectively. I don't want her to be lashing out at everybody and being angry at everybody and being angry at herself and, and, um, be able to, 'cuz see, she's, I've always told her since she was little that she's beautiful and that she's smart and that she can do anything, and she's always had that self-esteem buildup and I don't know what's just all of a sudden happened. And she has a father, her biological father who lives 20 minutes away and hasn't seen her in eight years. 

01:12:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN 20 minutes away and not, eight years? 

01:12:40
KATHY Yes. 

01:12:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, what, what gets in the way there? 

01:12:40
TIFFANY He's a crackhead. 

01:12:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN He's a crackhead? 

01:12:45
KATHY That's a joke, though, not literally. I mean, it's not. 

01:12:45
TIFFANY Well, we don't know. 

01:12:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You suspect that he's doing coke? 

01:12:50
TIFFANY I dunno. He's doing something. 

01:12:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:12:50
TIFFANY He's weird. 

01:12:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Um, give me a recent, blow-by-blow, videotape description of the situation where you saw what you're describing as her anger and bitterness, um, a recent scenario. I, you know. 

01:13:05
KATHY Um, one of the sisters'll come into her room or open the door, maybe without knocking and she'll lash out at her. 

01:13:20
JON CARLSON That was really interesting to watch the way that, you know, you framed the questions. And it looks like you're able to get a very clear objective in what Mom was looking for. 

01:13:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN She was obviously a very solution-oriented client. You know? I mean, sometimes you luck out. If you have a parent or a daughter who can clearly spell out, you know, what's going on and give you all the details and, and again, that makes our job much more easy when we know exactly what's going on that serves as the problem life-support system. You know, the, the, the family dance in which the problem is embedded. 

01:14:00
JON CARLSON You know, I think it's just, and I think a lot of others might have been tempted to stick with this notion of not talking to her birth father who lives only 20 minutes away for, for years, you know, and what that does with the object relations and, you know, I could have a field day with that. How, how did you resist that? 

01:14:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, my intuition was telling me that talking about that would be like walking on a minefield with this daughter. That there's a lot of emotionally-laden material there. And I could tell by the look on her face, too. She was kinda looking down and everything when Mom was talking about this, that this was a loaded issue. And so therefore, um, rather than rocking the boat here, I wanted to keep the focus on really trying to understand the current problem that they're struggling with and, um, and, and, and if later on the daughter brings that up as something that she's concerned about, then I'll revisit it. But I wanna stick with where the clients are at and focus on what their primary concern is at this point. 

01:15:05
DIANE KJOS The other thing that I was really struck by is the difference in dress between the mother and the daughter. And, um, actually I had asked the daughter about her blouse and she was wearing Mother's clothes which I thought was intriguing, but, but were you struck by that and did that have some influence on how you, uh? 

01:15:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, to be honest with you, I really didn't notice that. Um, and, you know, for me, I mean if she's wearing the mother's clothes, and I've worked with other mother-and-daughter combinations and, um, to me that says, that's a good sign that they're close. 

01:15:35
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:15:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, I work with a lot of mothers and daughters where it's World War III and they can't get that close and share each other's clothes and do things together. So that, that really, I didn't even see that as a difficulty. Yeah. 

01:15:50
JON CARLSON Well, in this next clip we're gonna watch, Matthew, you're gonna have, we're gonna watch you s-, see them communicating a little bit more stress-filled situation and watch as they break the problem down, or you help them break the problem down a little bit further. 

01:16:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. 

01:16:05
JON CARLSON So let's watch that piece. 

01:16:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay, great. 

01:16:10
KATHY Yeah. He just doesn't, uh. He has nobody. 

01:16:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How do you respond then, um, you know, after, let's say that she kicks it off, and chews out somebody comes in her room, and then what do you typically do? 

01:16:25
KATHY Depending on what time of day it is, uh, if it's 

01:16:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How about recently? Can you think of a situation where you had to manage this kind of thing? 

01:16:30
KATHY Kick the bedroom door in. 

01:16:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You kicked the bedroom? 

01:16:35
KATHY Yeah. Sure. 

01:16:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. You mean the bedroom door was locked? 

01:16:40
TIFFANY No. 

01:16:40
KATHY No. 

01:16:40
TIFFANY There's holes in all the doors. 

01:16:40
KATHY Then we won't have any problems with the bedroom door anymore. 

01:16:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah? Have you been able to spell your name in the door with the kicks? 

01:16:45
KATHY With the kicks? 

01:16:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:16:50
KATHY Well, I, I usually rotate, I go between doors and walls and chairs. 

01:16:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Okay. 

01:16:50
TIFFANY Yeah, we throw the chairs in the doors. 

01:16:55
KATHY Right. 

01:16:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So it sounds like, uh, there's, it runs in the genes here, huh? 

01:16:55
KATHY Yeah. Yeah. 

01:17:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So the anger sometimes gets the best of you, too? 

01:17:00
KATHY Yes. 

01:17:00
TIFFANY Not usually, though. 

01:17:00
KATHY Yeah, it takes a while. 

01:17:05
TIFFANY She's usually pretty calm. She'll be like, "Stop it, guys, stop it!" 

01:17:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right, so she comes in and says that, and then how do you respond to those? 

01:17:10
TIFFANY I close the door and they keep coming back in and 

01:17:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is that when the kicking starts? 

01:17:15
TIFFANY Actually, it starts after, then they do that and then she goes in her room, shuts the door, then they all come, like, knocking on her door every five seconds and then she starts screaming and 

01:17:25
JON CARLSON Wow. And this is, this is a pretty angry, volatile family. I mean, they're kicking holes in the doors? And yet you chose, um, not to deal with this. 

01:17:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, the-, there was a lot of things that I could've done here. Um, uh, you know, one of the things, first of all, one of the things that I attempted to do is move the heat off of Tiffany as a, you know, identified client, by saying, using humor as a way 

01:17:55
JON CARLSON I noticed that. 

01:17:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN To create possibilities and interactionalize the problem by commenting, "Oh, is sounds like, uh, anger runs in, you know, the genes in this family." And, um, I, and I shared with Mom, it sounds like anger also gets the best of you. Um, and so there was another route I could've gone here because the way 

01:18:15
JON CARLSON What would you have done, this other route? 

01:18:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. Um, I consider myself primarily solution-focused, but integrative and flexible. And sometimes when I hear that family members are being pushed around by the same problem, I'll externalize the problem out of, you know, the narrative, uh, way of looking at things and, and, and invite them to talk about who else in the family's getting pushed around by anger, and they're all being victimized. And organizing all of them, including, in this case, Tiffany, to go to, to war against anger and not allowing it to push them around as a family. So that, certainly that would have been another therapeutic option in the midst of this. 

01:18:55
JON CARLSON As we move on, we're gonna watch, uh, the next piece and it's, you're gonna focus on the relationship with her stepfather which is, up until recently, has been really bad. And yet, now you wanna focus on how it's been good rather than, I mean, it seems like maybe this being good is just a fluke. It's something that's just, like a mistake. 

01:19:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, for me, there's many ways to look at anyone of that, and possibly, you know, the two of them are pioneering a different kind of direction here in their relationship. And now that the father, or the stepfather is around more, um, maybe there's more room for connection. And, and the daughter is, is getting some needs met here that perhaps she wasn't getting met with her biological father. And, um, so I wanted to find out what the daughter is doing that seems to be working to help them get along better and build off of that. 

01:19:55
JON CARLSON Let's watch how you do that. 

01:19:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:20:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And do you get along with your stepdad pretty good or? 

01:20:05
TIFFANY Lately we've been straight, but for the most part, no. 

01:20:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. What's been happening lately that's helped you get along? 

01:20:10
TIFFANY He stopped being mean to me. And he said that he'll relate to me and he's like, being nice and my mom's like, me and my mom get in a fight, I can go to him then. But before I would be, me and my mom would get in a fight and then me and him would get in a fight. 

01:20:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So it's like tag-team wrestling. 

01:20:25
TIFFANY Yeah, especially with him 'cuz we always fight all the time. 

01:20:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. 

01:20:25
TIFFANY For like, eight or nine years, we'd just fight every day. I can't even be by him. 

01:20:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Huh. And so what, how did you get that to happen where you guys have been able to make sort of peace? 

01:20:35
TIFFANY He did it, I don't know. I stayed away from him and then he just all of a sudden decided to be like that. But then some days he'll be like, screaming at me and then five minutes later he'll be like, fine and it's weird. 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON So you just focused on what was working and just focused on how they'd come up with a solution. 

01:20:55
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

01:20:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, brings to mind, um, a Robert Frost poem, The Road Less Traveled By. "I chose to pursue the road less traveled by and it's making all the difference." Um, and I think it's, you know, certainly the way most of us have been trained to, to follow paths of trying to figure out why and dwelling on problems when, in this case, this family had so many strengths that we wanna build off of what's already working to construct a solution. 

01:21:25
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:21:30
DIANE KJOS I was thinking, she, she hadn't seen her real father for eight years 

01:21:35
JON CARLSON Birth father. 

01:21:35
DIANE KJOS Birth father. You subtract that, she's been fatherless for a long time. It's, uh. 

01:21:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:21:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:21:40
JON CARLSON Having no relationship with him, and now with that deep-seated rejection. Could be at the root of the an-, and I'm going off in a different direction here. I'm on that other path that Frost was talking about. 

01:21:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And, and again, um, the, I, my guess is it would have been working, walking on a land, you know, a mine field, uh, kind of experience with her if I took the lid off of that and we started going on that. 

01:22:00
DIANE KJOS But that almost seemed to be the way, the natural direction. It, I mean, 

01:22:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Sure. 

01:22:05
DIANE KJOS The empathic response would be, eight years and now, you know? 

01:22:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right, right. 

01:22:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:22:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I think most traditional therapists would've wanted to get into all those painful feelings and thoughts connected to that trauma. And in this case, I mean, there are a lot of positive things that the daughter's already doing to try and get something going with her stepfather, so let's build off of that. 

01:22:30
JON CARLSON Well, let's watching this next piece where you continue to focus on that other path and, uh, we'll get a chance to see where you're looking for that exception when you ask Mom about an exception with her daughter. 

01:22:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:22:50
TIFFANY walked in the door. 

01:22:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN That's great. Can you, have you seen him, have you seen her do anything differently around Brian that's helped them get along better? 

01:22:55
KATHY She's learned how to keep her mouth shut. 

01:23:00
TIFFANY Yeah, we've had a couple experiences with me and him. 

01:23:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Wow. What do you, what do you do, bite your tongue or, how do you keep your mouth shut? 

01:23:05
TIFFANY Well, I've learned that I don't wanna get grounded off the phone so I just. 

01:23:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. Oh, that's a very important thing. Your whole social life. Yeah. That's great. 

01:23:20
JON CARLSON And this approach really is refreshing. And, uh, you ask questions that people can answer and they actually feel pretty good about it. 

01:23:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, I think when people come to us they're feeling really stuck, really pessimistic 

01:23:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:23:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh, paralyzed by their difficulties and this is kind of a, a shot in the arm. It's refreshing for the clients to have somebody accentuate, you know, what's good about them. 

01:23:45
JON CARLSON There's hope. 

01:23:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You're bringing out the best in them. It's empowering. Uh, it makes, it creates a climate that's ripe for change. 

01:23:50
JON CARLSON And not only can we do something different, maybe we are. 

01:23:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. And what happens is when, especially when parents come in with their kids, it's like there's this big mountain before their eyes and they can't see anything beyond it. And, and that's the problem mountain. And what we're doing is we're chiseling away at that mountain and we're looking what's behind it, what's to the side of it, what's in front of it. And, and I, I think that what happens is in the midst of the doom and gloom people forget about the positive steps that they're already taking that seem to be making a difference. 

01:24:20
JON CARLSON Well, we're gonna move on to the next piece and there's a little gap in, um, uh, in the tape that we're gonna watch. And you had just asked them the miracle question and let's listen to their responses. 

01:24:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, and, and things have changed the way you want them to. What would be in each of your miracle pictures the next day when you wake up? 

01:24:50
TIFFANY I don't know. I wouldn't. I don't know. It would be weird because it wouldn't be the same as it always is and so I wouldn't know what I would want 'cuz I can't react well to peace. It just doesn't work right with me. 

01:25:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You're not used to it. 

01:25:05
TIFFANY No. 

01:25:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, what, what else might be there that will help you feel better about things at home? 

01:25:10
TIFFANY A lock on my door that works. 

01:25:15
JON CARLSON Boy, she was very specific, wasn't she? 

01:25:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:25:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, it sounds like at times things get, things get kinda chaotic with seven children, you know, and at times all bouncing off the wall and the colicky baby. Um, she wants a reprieve from all that and she wants to able to go in her room, which I think is a really healthy thing to do. Take yourself out of that chaos rather than getting yourself in trouble. Again, a sign of her resourcefulness. 

01:25:40
DIANE KJOS When you think of the kicking down the door or kicking holes in the doors, it's, you know, when she m-, says a lock on my door that works, it's, that's a significant piece, yeah. 

01:25:50
JON CARLSON Sounds like these doors are a big part of this family. 

01:25:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:25:55
JON CARLSON And, uh, boundaries don't seem to mean a whole lot. 

01:25:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:25:55
JON CARLSON You know, in this group. 

01:26:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

01:26:00
JON CARLSON As we move along, you're gonna do something different now. I mean, a lot of, uh, I mean, a lot therapists, you start with the same people and you stay with them the whole session. Now you've asked the daughter to leave and you're just gonna talk along with Mom. Is that a good idea? 

01:26:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. I find it helpful. And especially out of respect for parents, you know, as the authority in the family, to meet alone with the parents and, and here I can get into more details about their attempted solutions and, um, maybe break down the presenting problem into, you know, bite-sized pieces to create a more solvable problem. Um, and also be able to find out more about, um, you know, um, their views, their beliefs about this problem so that I can use that, um, to help them to look at things differently, maybe even give them, uh, sometimes a task of some sort, an observation task, be like a super-sleuth detective and keep track of any encouraging responsible steps that they see their kid take. So literally teach them how to be solution-oriented detectives. Um. 

01:27:05
JON CARLSON And, and you really couldn't do that as effectively in the context of both mom and daughter in the room at the same time? 

01:27:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I find it helpful to intervene top-down and bottom-up simultaneously. You know, help parents, uh, look at things differently, do things differently, experiment with new ways of being around their kid, as well as having the kid do things differently around the parent and, and maybe trying to help them look at things in a new way. 

01:27:30
DIANE KJOS Maybe surprise each other. 

01:27:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. Yeah, in fact, one of the interventions I use a lot is called the secret surprise where I meet alone with the kid and I'll have the kid come up with two surprises that'll shock their parents in a positive way. And they're not to tell their parents what those things are. Um, and then when I reconvene the family, then I have the parents be like, you know, Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marple and pull out their imaginary magnifying glasses and look for those surprises. 

01:27:55
DIANE KJOS For the surprises. And of course, they may well find more surprises than the child expected. 

01:28:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:28:05
JON CARLSON A bit of, uh, trickery going on here, it sounds like. 

01:28:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Positive trickery. 

01:28:10
JON CARLSON Positive trickery. Let, let's watch you interviewing with Mom and, uh, and this piece we're gonna see really does what you talked about. It really underscores her pattern and maybe her role in, uh, what's going on at home. 

01:28:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Mm-hmm. Okay. 

01:28:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, I've heard some things that you've mentioned that seem to be helpful. Um, and, and it's, it was really beautiful the way you could see that dance that the harder you try to sort of be the peacekeeper here and take charge of the situation the more it blows up. 

01:28:50
KATHY Why is that? That makes no common sense to me. 

01:28:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, it's really interesting to me. You know, we were talking about teenagers, that, I've seen this a lot, that parents, the more super-responsible they are, you know, and trying to save their kids and trying to get them to be responsible, the more irresponsible their kids are. 

01:29:05
KATHY Okay, because I have friends that totally neglect their kids and that lady I was counseling before, totally neglected her kids and was on drugs, these kids were the best kids and they were brilliant and they could, they were self-motivated. And I'm thinking, this is what you have to do? You have to neglect your children to get them to be the way, this makes no sense to me. It's the opposite of what should happen. 

01:29:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:29:35
JON CARLSON It was like she was in a trance. You know, when she talked to you and she looked at you. And then this pattern, well, it seems so obvious to all of us of this over-functioning, under-functioning. Boy, she just doesn't seem to have any clue about what to do. 

01:29:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I, first of all, I, I believe that all parents are trying to do the best they can. And I also think that, you know, here we can look at traditional gender, um, being pushed around about this whole idea about, you know, how women should be and it's up to Mom to solve the kids' problems and she's been caught up in that. Um, but you know, I think what happens is it's hard for parents to sort of step outside their dance and see themselves in action and sometimes by interpreting the process for them and making them aware of that, that can help them do things differently. And they can see their part in, in this problem life-support system. 

01:30:30
DIANE KJOS And it's something she's been thinking about but not, not, maybe not in terms of being over-involved, but she's been thinking about "How come what I'm doing isn't working?" 

01:30:40
JON CARLSON And, and are you kind of thinking at this point in time as you're working with them about ways that you can get her maybe to give up some of this responsibility and to get some other people maybe to step up to the plate? 

01:30:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, in the interview, um, I explored with her things that she's been doing to take care of herself. And, and I make a, um, a big deal about the importance of having balance in your life, that in order to, you know, be there and to manage this tough job as a parent of all these kids, you also have to take care of yourself. So I explore with her things that she's doing to take care of herself and we discover some important exceptions there. Um, she actually asserted herself with big, big tough Brian about, you know, "You need to take the little two nights so that I can be free." Um, and she came up with something else. She has a friend that she wants to reconnect with and, so. 

01:31:35
JON CARLSON We're gonna watch, you know, in the next piece, some, uh, ideas that she could do that might be helpful and I think that's sort of what you're, you know, you're alluding to now. So let's watch that piece. 

01:31:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:31:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I, I think that part of that is what Brian's doing. 

01:31:50
KATHY Okay. 

01:31:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN But I'm wondering if there's other things that you've been doing that has helped her, you know, maybe chill out more, you know, not fly off the handle. 

01:32:00
KATHY I've told her to watch me. 

01:32:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Be more responsible. 

01:32:05
KATHY When, because I try to tell her that people are who they are and we can't change who they are, so we need to learn how it is to react to how they, they say things to us. He says things in a whole different way than I say things and a lot of times it really sounds hurtful or it really sounds powerful and it, you know, it's pushy and, and she's the kind of person that needs to jump back up. And I used to be too and I think that's why God put this person in my life so I can learn how, how to, to, to moderate that. You know, and to me it's just not worth jumping back up and being ignorant. I'll just let him get out whatever it is he has to say, sometimes I won't say anything, or sometimes I'll say something very profound that, that'll just shut him up because he really can't. But if you jump back up at, at him in anger and then he's just ready to go. You know? He's just, that's what he's looking for most of the time. He wants three or four hours of rounds with an intellectual mindscrew and, you know, it, and that's what I've told her. Just don't go there. 

01:33:10
JON CARLSON Well, that was an important piece. It did-, wasn't exactly what we were talking about, though, but it was important in the way that she was learning how to help her daughter more. 

01:33:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, I'm, besides exploring with the identified client the things that they do to help themselves out, you know, useful self-talk, coping, problem-solving strategies, I wanna know what the parents are doing that are help facilitating their pro-social and their positive behavior and see if we can increase that, build off of that. And it sounded like Mom has offered, um, Tiffany some really helpful words of wisdom about how to manage Brian and, you know, what to watch out for. 

01:33:50
JON CARLSON Mm-hmm. Well, we're gonna jump ahead now and we're gonna watch you working alone with Tiffany. And, um, in this piece, uh, one of the things that, uh, you're attempting to do is to work and gather some information to create a quid pro quo or a something for something exchange. Can you talk a little bit about that and kinda set this piece up? 

01:34:15
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

01:34:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. When, when you work with adolescents, you really have to find out what's in it for them. And you have to work both sides of the intergenerational fence. You have to, and to, you know, help the parents realize their goals, um, and learn helpful strategies, but at the same time, you need to, you know, help the adolescent feel like, you know, you've heard them out in terms of their needs and expectations, what privileges they want from their parents, what, and I always like to use the, ask the question, you know, what does your parents do that ticks you off the most that you would like me to work on changing? And my experience has been that when the adolescents see that their parents are changing and you're trying to make that happen, they will stay hooked in counseling and go the, you know, for the distance. And, and they'll make some changes too. So I try to set up this something for something contract. So once I know what they want, I can bring that to the parents and negotiate. 

01:35:05
JON CARLSON Good. 

01:35:05
JON CARLSON Sort of like a labor relations arbitrator. 

01:35:10
JON CARLSON Let's watch this next clip. 

01:35:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:35:15
TIFFANY We're pretty straight for the most part. 

01:35:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, you mentioned earlier that you would love to have your own phone line, your own phone in your room. And I, and I'd really like to see that happen. 

01:35:25
TIFFANY I had my own phone line in my room, but I got in trouble. 

01:35:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Why, 'cuz you ran up big bills or? 

01:35:30
TIFFANY Yeah, I had supposedly made 69 three-way calls. And I had just gotten it back in my room then so then they took it out again. 

01:35:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is that, is that the number one thing on your list that you'd like to have back? 

01:35:40
TIFFANY Yup. 

01:35:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. You know, I was talking to your mom about that and I was saying to her that I thought that was a good idea. And now that you're getting older and you're more responsible, 

01:35:55
TIFFANY Well it just happened like, last week. 

01:35:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. So, I guess what I wanted to, to see if you'd be willing to do this because she's willing to work with you on this. Um, and that is that if there are certain things that you could do to help out to earn money so that you can be able to pay for this. And 

01:36:15
TIFFANY I can get a job next year and then I can just get my own line in there. 

01:36:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, but she has some ideas about things you might be able to do. 

01:36:25
TIFFANY I don't like working for them. 

01:36:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You don't? 

01:36:25
TIFFANY I mean, we do all this big stuff, they'll be like, okay, I'll clean out the whole basement and I'll give you 50 cents. It's like, not really. 

01:36:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What if we were able to come up with some little things as ways to earn money? Would you be willing to work with your mom on that? 

01:36:40
TIFFANY Mm-hmm. 

01:36:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN All right, help me out. What things will you at all costs be, refuse to do versus what things would you be willing to do as the little things to earn money. 

01:36:50
TIFFANY Only thing I won't do is pick up after that dog. 

01:36:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:36:55
TIFFANY I don't care what else I do. 

01:36:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN No, no use of the poopy scooper. 

01:37:00
TIFFANY No, I don't like that. 

01:37:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:37:00
TIFFANY I mean, I'll change the baby and all that kind of stuff, I don't care about that. 

01:37:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN How, how are you doing with that? Do you like doing that? 

01:37:05
TIFFANY The baby's straight. She's cool 'cuz you can talk to her and she doesn't talk back. 

01:37:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Uh-huh. 

01:37:10
JON CARLSON Matthew, what did you learn in that segment from her that you're gonna use in the solution? 

01:37:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I know for a fact that the number one thing because she's Miss Socialite, she has to have that phone. 

01:37:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

01:37:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So this is a real good, um, bargaining chip that we can use in negotiating with the parents, you know, first of all, um, you know, getting something small from the mom in terms of something specific she wants Tiffany to do and then in return she can earn getting the phone back. And, and, you know, when I mentioned, uh, you know, things that you could do around the house, you know, she said, "I'm not gonna do big things." So I switched it to little things, small things. And then the other thing I would do there is involve the parents and, um, kind of have like a democratic process where the kid has a voice in determining also what chores they're willing to do. 

01:38:05
DIANE KJOS That's reasonable. 

01:38:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN There's nothing worse than, you know, parents saying, "We want you to do these three things," and they're three things the kid will never do. 

01:38:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:38:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, we wanna maximize for success. 

01:38:15
JON CARLSON 'Kay, let's watch this next clip, and this next clip you continue to talk to her. And this time you ask her to talk about ways that she can help Mom and Mom is somebody who she really cares about. So let's watch this one. 

01:38:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:38:30
TIFFANY but I don't. 

01:38:30
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, is there any, um, do you have any ideas for me that you think would be helpful for me to share with your mom about things that she should do that could help her be less, 'cuz it sounds like Mom gets really stressed out with all these kids and the baby crying all the time. Is there any, any things that you have that you think could be helpful for her to know? 

01:38:55
TIFFANY Not that I can think of. 

01:38:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Help her be less stressed out? 

01:38:55
TIFFANY I dunno. I think she should just, if she feels stressed, she should just leave for like, a couple hours or go somewhere so that she doesn't have to be around it. Maybe like have a babysitter or my dad or something. But she shouldn't stay at the house all the time like she does 'cuz that's not gonna help her at all. 

01:39:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Would that be something you be willing to do to sort of help her out and take over for a little bit? 

01:39:15
TIFFANY Yeah. Yeah. 

01:39:20
JON CARLSON Wow. That was neat. 

01:39:20
DIANE KJOS Get Mom out of the house. 

01:39:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Well, I thought that was really beautiful. And again, it, it, it showed me how, how loving she is as a daughter, how she really cares about her mom and has a capacity for empathy. 

01:39:35
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:39:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, but what I was asking there is what I call a reversal question and sometimes I do this in the company of the parents. I'll ask, you know, "Do you have any ideas for your parents about how they can help you be more responsible?" And I, and I s-, I elevate the identified client which challenges the parents' views if, you know, they're coming in looking at the kid as being negative and it's challenging that view and showing how competent they are and how creative. And kids are very resourceful. So she had some really helpful ideas there of some things that can help the mom out and she's willing to pitch in. 

01:40:05
JON CARLSON In this next clip we're gonna see you even find some more things to build on. Let's watch how you ask for exceptions in this next piece. 

01:40:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Is there, is there anything that, as a leader in this family because you're like, the oldest, pretty much, is there anything that you think you could do that could help, help with that situation in any way? 

01:40:30
TIFFANY Just not start stuff with them. That's all I can do. Which is hard 'cuz they're little brats. 

01:40:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Are there, ha-, have there been any times lately where you were tempted to like, start something up but you held back and did something else instead? 

01:40:50
TIFFANY Couple of times today. 

01:40:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN What kinds of things did you do? 

01:40:50
TIFFANY I would just go in my room, turn my music up so I wouldn't have to think about them anymore. 

01:41:00
JON CARLSON Boy, she really is resourceful. 

01:41:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN A solution-oriented client! 

01:41:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! Yeah. 

01:41:05
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, they come out of this same mold here. 

01:41:05
JON CARLSON She just knows right what to do. 

01:41:05
DIANE KJOS That brought me back to that phone because she could go in and call a friend, you know? 

01:41:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Absolutely. 

01:41:10
DIANE KJOS There's a piece of that. 

01:41:10
JON CARLSON Takes herself right out of it. 

01:41:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:41:15
JON CARLSON Well, now we're moving onto the final part and that's the wrap-up where you have mom and dad, or mom and daughter back together again. And it seemed like you were just really focusing on strengths and you were trying to get them to keep doing what worked and you were sort of, uh, would you call him a Pollyanna? I mean, he was really, uh, this real, seeing only the positives and, uh. 

01:41:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:41:40
JON CARLSON Very refreshing, though. I mean, not in a, not in a sappy, phony way. I mean, it was all from the heart. 

01:41:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. Um, again, when clients come to see us, they assume, especially when there's been this break in the session, when they're sitting out there waiting, they're wondering, what are you gonna say that's bad or, or wrong with them? Or what has to be fixed? And it's a pleasant surprise for them to come in to be met with all these compliments. Um, the other thing I like to do, not with this situation, is positively relabel negative behaviors. 

01:42:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:42:10
MATTHEW SELEKMAN You know, um, like an ADD kid is an active, dynamic, and determined kid. You know? Um, so throwing out new ways of looking at things. And if I have a question, something I'm curious about, I might throw that question out there. And then, often times, you know, if it's not real straightforward, um, I might offer a menu of different, uh, tasks for them, experiments for them to choose from and they can pick and choose what they'd like to do. So it's real collaborative. 

01:42:40
JON CARLSON Well, in the first piece we're gonna watch, we'll watch two pieces from the wrap-up. The first piece you go hard at work and you're attempting to get the daughter to increase her responsibility and to maybe function more so that her mom can actually do less. Let's watch that. 

01:42:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN down and help things be less chaotic. 

01:43:00
KATHY Okay. 

01:43:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Um, you also recognize a lot of Tiffany's strengths: that she's responsible and mature and can be a big help to you and, and also you've noticed this budding relationship with, with Brian which is really significant. I mean, this is a nice, it's sort of like a second chance, you know, that there's rough going with Dad, but now you have the opportunity to build a positive relationship with another father figure. Um, and the other thing that I really liked too is that in recognizing her responsible behavior and her ability to really take responsibility and, and help out, that perhaps we can build into this whole situation opportunities for her to earn money so that she can have the kinds of things that she wants. 

01:43:50
KATHY Right. 

01:43:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I did check that out with her and she did say that there would be some things that she'd be willing to do to, to earn the privileges that she wants, having the phone line, stuff like that. And perhaps that's something that the two of you can work on together. 

01:44:05
KATHY Okay. 

01:44:05
JON CARLSON You know, this is just so upbeat. I can't get over it, you know? I'm thinking that, you know, kids would really like this approach. It's not so doom and it's not so gloom and it, like it works. Yeah. 

01:44:20
Matthew Selekman, M.S.W. SOLUTION-ORIENTED THERAPY 

01:44:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah, I, I've been involved in some research, um, with this way of working and, um, kids have been interviewed about what their experience is like in this model. And, um, and these families have also had an opportunity like a virtual reality looking at session tapes and stop the tape with the controller and comment on what the therapist is doing in there. And this one kid was saying, "Yes, he cheering me on! And it feels good!" and, and Mom's saying, "But, you know, what about this?" you know? 

01:44:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:44:50
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And, um, so kids really do like this. Um, there's a lot of energy there with adolescents and, um, this is a very positive, energetic kind of model. 

01:45:00
JON CARLSON Uh, in the final clip we're gonna watch, um, you tell this story about your colleague, uh, having this sign on their door or somewhere about they should solve their problems before they come in, before they can get some work. So let's watch. 

01:45:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Okay. 

01:45:15
JON CARLSON Uh, that piece. 

01:45:20
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And I thought that was really great. So I just wanna say that, you know, you guys remind me, I have a friend who has a sign in her office that says, for clients, it says, "Please solve your problems before you come in here so I can help you more." You guys, I mean you guys are so resourceful and you already know what you need to do, it's just doing more of it. 

01:45:40
KATHY Right. 

01:45:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And being consistent with it. 

01:45:40
KATHY And the consistency, yes. Yes. 

01:45:45
MATTHEW SELEKMAN So I don't wanna mess with a good thing so my recommendation to both of you is, um, keep track on a daily basis of the various things that you will do that will help get more order in this household and help you work together more as a team. 

01:46:00
KATHY Okay. 

01:46:00
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And what works. And keep doing more of that. 

01:46:05
JON CARLSON As I watch this, you know, ending, or near the ending piece, a lot has changed, I mean. 

01:46:10
DIANE KJOS Yes. Yeah. 

01:46:10
JON CARLSON You can just feel the tension. 

01:46:10
DIANE KJOS Particularly the mother has more hope. You know, you just, there's a, a sense of that. The other thing that struck me as, when you said the more order piece, is the, the order for the girl is more important than it is, I think, for the mother. There's a sense in her mind that we need this order and, uh, 'cuz she, and she responded to that. Uh, yeah. 

01:46:35
JON CARLSON So, as you look back, you know, on this interview, are there any final comments that you might have about your work? 

01:46:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN I think it's a shame that I didn't have Brian there, the stepfather because I, I think we could have done some nice work there. And for him to be able to hear, um, you know, the thi-, you know, that Tiffany is trying and she does wanna have a, a different kind of relationship, and also to hear how Mom is supporting, um, their efforts to come together and have a, a bu-, a better relationship, um, I think could've been really helpful. 

01:47:10
JON CARLSON And is that the direction you would go from here with them is to at least get Brian involved? 

01:47:15
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Absolutely. I think you have to, and I call it "cover the back door" because I did hear, um, you know, one of Tiffany's concerns and that is that he does have a hot temper. 

01:47:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:47:25
MATTHEW SELEKMAN "And all it'll take is for me to do something wrong and then he might blow his stack and things might recalibrate backwards to where things were before," maybe where's there's more distance in their relationship so I think we gotta cover that piece. 

01:47:35
DIANE KJOS He might sabotage their efforts. 

01:47:35
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Yeah. 

01:47:35
DIANE KJOS And not even consciously, but. 

01:47:40
MATTHEW SELEKMAN And, and also continue to help Mom out and getting her more breathing room to take care of herself and, and, and maybe, maybe we increase another night or something with Brian taking over or whatever. 

01:47:50
JON CARLSON Yeah, give her some different assignments other than the ones of doing for everybody else. 

01:47:55
MATTHEW SELEKMAN Right. 

01:47:55
JON CARLSON Maybe to do something for herself. Thank you, Matthew, for showing the inner workings of this approach that at first seemed deceptively simple, but the more you described this and let us in on the inside, we realized just what a talent it takes to do this kind of work effectively. 

01:48:15
