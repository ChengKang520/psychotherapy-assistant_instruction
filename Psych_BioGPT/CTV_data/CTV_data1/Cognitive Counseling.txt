The Association for Counselor Education and Supervision AC ES and CHI SIGMA IOTA (Counseling Academic & Professional Honor Society Int.) AC ES PRESENT COGNITIVE COUNSELING AN EDUCATIONAL VIDEO 

00:00:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Hello I'm Sam Gladding, representing the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision and Chi Sigma Iota as narrator of these videos. Cognitive counseling has grown in popularity over the years. In this video, Dr. Jan Holden examines the common threads of this approach. She also demonstrates how a variety of cognitive counseling skills can be used with clients over the lifespan. 

00:01:15
OVERVIEW OF COGNITIVE COUNSELING 

00:01:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Cognitive counseling uses the theory and techniques of cognitive therapy that were pioneered by Aaron Beck beginning in the early 1970s. Since that time, other cognitive therapists have joined Beck in expanding and popularizing the approach. These include Donald Meichenbaum, Michael Mahoney and David Burns. At about the same time that Beck was developing cognitive therapy, Albert Ellis was developing Rational Emotive Therapy, RET. There is a fundamental similarity between cognitive counseling and RET. Both approaches are based on the philosophy that a belief is associated with every emotion and behavior. And that when the emotion or behavior is unwanted in some way, by identifying the belief that's associated with it, exploring that belief and reformulating it into a somewhat different form, the emotion and/or behavior associated with that belief will also be changed. Because of this fundamental similarity, people sometimes wonder what the differences are between RET and cognitive counseling. One difference involves the therapeutic relationship. Of the three core conditions of counseling: empathy, genuineness and warmth RET values the first two. By contrast, in cognitive counseling, empathy, genuineness and warmth are all considered to be necessary conditions for constructive client change. A second difference between RET and cognitive counseling involves irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions. 

00:03:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN The 13 irrational beliefs of RET involves specific contents such as, "I must be approved of by everyone I find to be important." By contrast, in cognitive counseling, the 10 cognitive distortions involve abstract principles that can apply to a variety of specific content. For example, the cognitive distortion of " all or nothing" thinking can be seen in the belief, "If I didn't get an A, I failed." A third difference is that, unlike in RET,-

TYPOLOGY OF EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE 

00:03:35
RATIONAL-EMOTIVE THERAPY: None COGNITIVE COUNSELING: Extensive & specific 

00:03:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  -in cognitive counseling, certain types of beliefs are believed to be associated with certain emotions than emotional disturbances. For example, anxiety is associated with perceived threat; sadness is associated with perceived loss. And the fourth difference between RET and cognitive counseling involves how beliefs, once they've been identified, are challenged by the counselor. In RET, the counselor takes a very active role disputing the beliefs of the client and trying to convince the client of the error of their thinking. In- 

00:04:15
HOW BELIEFS ARE CHALLENGED RATIONAL-MOTIVE THERAPY: Counselor actively persuades client COGNITIVE COUNSELING: Counselor collaborates with client 

00:04:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN -Cognitive counseling, by contrast, the counselor and client collaborate first in identifying what's erroneous or self- defeating about a particular belief, and then in modifying the belief, so it seems more objectively true and fosters less distressing feelings to the client. As cognitive counseling has become more popular, several myths have become associated with it. One is the myth that cognitive counseling is simply the power of positive thinking. In fact, for a belief to be considered valid from a cognitive counseling point of view, it not only helps a client feel more positive, but really seems, in an objective way, to make more sense to the client to be truer. 

00:04:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN A second myth of cognitive counseling is that it does not address emotions. In fact, in a normal cognitive counseling session, the counselor will periodically direct the client to be aware what they're experiencing emotionally. 

00:05:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN A third myth is that the goal of cognitive counseling is the elimination of emotion. Whereas it's true that a major goal of cognitive counseling is to help people reduce unnecessarily distressing emotions, cognitive counselors readily acknowledge the important role that emotions play in lending meaning to life and helping people to meet life's circumstances. In the following vignettes, the processes and techniques of cognitive counseling will be demonstrated.

"MICHAEL" FIRST SESSION WITH AN ADOLESCENT 

00:05:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hi Michael. 

00:05:40
MICHAEL  Hi. 

00:05:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN You're here for the first time for counseling. 

00:05:50
MICHAEL Correct. 

00:05:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. I guess I'm most interested in finding out, for starters, what brought you here. 

00:05:55
MICHAEL Well, uhm, suppose if you want to like put it down in one word or somethin', you know, like depression or something, ah, I suppose you'd call it anger. 

00:06:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm. 

00:06:05
MICHAEL Ah, at ah, well, basically two people really. One of them is my ex-girlfriend and one is the guy that, ah, she, you know, started going out with. We're, we were going together for about, ah, six or seven months and, and ah, this is about a month and a half ago, she comes up and just, you know, breaks up and dumps me. 

00:06:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
MICHAEL If you wanna put it bluntly... (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
MICHAEL ...for this other guy who's like really popular. And I'm infuriated at both of 'em. Ah, her for just, I don't know, just being so uncaring, just stabbed me in the back like that. 

00:06:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
MICHAEL And him, you know, well, first of all, he's, I'm, I've known him for several years. I mean, he's not one of my closest friends but he was like a mild acquaintance. And he knew that we are going out. And I just, I'm just both infuriated at both of them. And right now, I just, and well, see, I've been like that for about a month and a half now and I can't really concentra, I can't even be in the same room with them... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL ...without feeling this. 

00:07:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL  And so, and it's getting to the point of ri, being ridiculous. I can't, I mean, I just wanna be able, you know, go on, and get on with my life... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
JAN HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:07:10
MICHAEL ...and forget about this... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:07:10
MICHAEL ...but. (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  So you feel betrayed by both of them, it sounds like. 

00:07:15
MICHAEL Right. 

00:07:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:07:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, at the same time, it sounds like, if they've been going together for a month and a half, you seem to be sort of accepting that this is pretty much a done deal. 

00:07:30
MICHAEL Yeah. I just can't get over, I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN But you're having trouble with, his, still having feelings that you'd like to be able to free yourself from. 

00:07:35
MICHAEL Right, exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, and mostly anger. I wonder if you can give me an example of a recent time when you really felt a lot of anger, toward them. 

00:07:45
MICHAEL That's easy, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm. 

00:07:50
MICHAEL ...let's see, uhm, there's like, I think it was, it's about a week ago, I think, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
MICHAEL ...we were, it was like, you know, we have like five minutes between classes. And, ah, you know, I saw them and, uhm, their lockers are, all three of our lockers are, you know, pretty close by. And she was over at his locker and they were just kissing, you know, I mean, right there, out in the open and. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
MICHAEL You know, my locker's nearby and I'm trying to get my books out, trying to concentrate on my, what I need to be thinking about. And, you know, there they are, just, and this wasn't just a mild peck on the cheek, this was, you know, deep... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Passionate. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
MICHAEL Yeah, passionate kiss. I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
MICHAEL ...I'm, I'm going and it just, yeah, it's... (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
MICHAEL ...infuriating, you know. 

00:08:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
MICHAEL And I'm thinkin', I'm thinking, my God, it smells like, you know, I'm thinking it was about a, about what, five, six weeks now, you know? 

00:08:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
MICHAEL I'm thinking this is ridiculous. I just wanna, ah, get over this and get on with my life. 

00:08:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:08:40
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:08:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And so, I wonder if you could stay back, uhm, with that, uhm, memory and, ah, kind of be back there in the hall and you see them and kind of freeze the frame and explore... (crosstalk) 

00:08:55
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:08:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...a little bit. What's going through your mind as you're feeling this anger and what I mean by that is, it could be thoughts, it could be images, uhm. 

00:09:05
MICHAEL Ah... (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
JAN HOLDEN It seems to be... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
MICHAEL ...as I look at them, hate seems to be ah, I'd say... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
MICHAEL ...a pretty good word. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. You're really angry with them for be... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
MICHAEL Yeah, I mean it's just... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...for betraying you. 

00:09:15
MICHAEL Yeah, I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JAN HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:09:15
MICHAEL ...and just seeing them, like that, I mean, this is just, I mean, it brings it all back. (crosstalk) 

00:09:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:09:20
MICHAEL You know, right to the forefront of me. 

00:09:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:09:25
MICHAEL And I mean, it's just, that's like, I don't know, uhm, I'm, se, just seeing them kissing is like a big symbol of, you know. 

00:09:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
MICHAEL You know, what happens. I just can't get it out of my mind. 

00:09:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. And, uhm, it sounds as if you, you, uhm, ah, ah, my guess is, because a lot times, anger is related to thoughts about "should," another person should or shouldn't have done a certain thing. You're nodding a little bit like, that's sort of it's. (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:09:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Like, wha, how, what would you... (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
MICHAEL This, (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...show? 

00:09:55
MICHAEL this shouldn't have happened. 

00:09:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN This shouldn't have happened. 

00:09:55
MICHAEL That should be me over there kissing her and not him. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN That should be you. 

00:10:00
MICHAEL Cause I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
MICHAEL All right this is a popular guy, and I mean, he had, I've seen him gone, go out with, I could name four, five off the top of my head... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
MICHAEL And, ah, you know, I mean, and, I mean, he knew that we're going together and I mean just. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. That any, (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
MICHAEL Why us? I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN any decent person wouldn't... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:10:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...have, uhm, have taken advantage... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
MICHAEL And then I look at them... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...of the situation. 

00:10:20
MICHAEL ...and you say should and shouldn't, I'm, this shouldn't have happened. That should be me. 

00:10:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:25
MICHAEL  So, you know. 

00:10:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. I guess, you know, ah, I would like to, uhm, sort of create a scene there. And 'cause I know that what... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN You, what you wanna do, your goal really is, to be able to let go of this anger and just... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
MICHAEL Exactly. 

00:10:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...like accept this and, and move on. And, uhm, so, ah, imagine that you're standing there and another guy walks up. He's kind of walking by. It's somebody that you really don't know that he doesn't know Amy and Jonathan, did you say his name... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:11:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...was? Uh-huh. And, uhm, and you happened to say, kind of under your breath, "This shouldn't have happened." Now, what would another, just another high school person. 

00:11:20
MICHAEL If he didn't know... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN If he... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
MICHAEL Any of the three of us? 

00:11:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...didn't know any of the three of you. And he stopped and said, "Well, what should ha, shouldn't have happened?" And then you say to him, "Oh, that guy stole my girlfriend. And it shouldn't have happened." What made a, kind of. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
MICHAEL He'd probably sa, he'd probab, if I were him, he'd probably be saying something like, ah, you know, "Very well, that's just the way it goes. I mean, it happens all the time." 

00:11:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm. 

00:11:45
MICHAEL I mean, from an outsider's of point of view, I would suppose I would... (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm. 

00:11:50
MICHAEL ...believe what he would say. 

00:11:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, what do you think about that, that, uhm, the idea that in high school, unfortunately... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:11:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN It does happens a lot. Yeah, does... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MICHAEL It does, (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...sometimes happens. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MICHAEL it does. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:12:00
MICHAEL I mean, you see it happens, it's just, you know, other people just kinda like, "Oh, well," but ah, you know, I mean, when it happens to you it's like... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Sure. 

00:12:05
MICHAEL ...a totally different story. 

00:12:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Definitely. Yeah, because it's, because you're really hurt, you really miss her and... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...and, ah, sounds like you had some, some real feeling for her. 

00:12:15
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
MICHAEL And it's like afterwards she just kinda acted like, you know, I mean, we're really close, at least in my opinion. 

00:12:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:12:20
MICHAEL  And, you know, afterwards, it seemed just like, you know, she was just like, "Oh, we, we went out a couple of times, so what?" And I was like... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:12:30
MICHAEL I don't think so. 

00:12:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Yeah. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
MICHAEL And I. (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So she, it seemed like it, to you, that she was minimizing what really was... (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:12:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...a more important, relationship. 

00:12:40
MICHAEL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. So, uhm, I guess now what I'd like you to do is imagine that you're standing there in the hall, okay, and, as I wanna do a sort of a take one and a take two sort of thing. 

00:12:50
MICHAEL  Okay. 

00:12:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And as all you have to do is, as I, uhm, as I say the things that I'm saying with each take, be aware of what happens to your anger whether it goes up or down, or stays the same, okay? (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:13:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN All right. So here's take one. 

00:13:10
MICHAEL All right. 

00:13:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN You're in the hall. You see them kissing and you're thinking, " They shouldn't be doing this. He shouldn't have taken her. She shouldn't have gone with him. I should be there." Okay? What's happening to your anger? 

00:13:25
MICHAEL On a scale of one to ten... (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
MICHAEL ...are you saying? 

00:13:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
MICHAEL Ten being the highest, probably about a nine. 

00:13:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
MICHAEL I'd say it'd really be up there, Yeah. 

00:13:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN It'd be really up there. 

00:13:30
MICHAEL Uh-huh. 

00:13:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And it sounds like that's pretty much what actually did happen. 

00:13:35
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:13:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, okay. Now, maybe, take a breath or sort of clear that, yeah, as you sort of roll your eyes and yeah, ah, clear... (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
MICHAEL I'm gonna just. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...that out and yeah let it go. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:13:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Now, take two. You're walking down the hall. You happened to look over there and you see them. And you begin to think, uhm, "She shouldn't have done that and all that." 

00:13:55
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And then you catch yourself and you remind yourself, as much as it hurts, this stuff does happen. 

00:14:05
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And people do sometimes betray other people, unfortunately. What happens to your anger? 

00:14:15
MICHAEL That would lower it down a bit, I suppose, you know, if I put on the number scale that'd be about, I would lower it down to maybe like a four or five, at, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. 

00:14:25
MICHAEL ...I mean, that would take time, I suppose? 

00:14:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. You might, you might have to really practice. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:14:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uhm, trying to look at it that way, in order to reduce your anger. 

00:14:30
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:14:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Yeah. But, uhm, that, I think it's important to, uhm, ah, to practice it, to anchor it in yourself by imagining scenes like that and practicing, reminding yourself that, as unfortunate as it is. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
MICHAEL Hmm. 

00:14:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN That kind of stuff does still happen. 

00:14:50
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:14:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Now, I noticed, I noticed that your face changes a little bit as you get into that. And you seemed to be more, uhm, in touch with like, regret or sadness that that kind of thing happens. 

00:15:05
MICHAEL Yeah. 'Coz, I mean, it's not fair. It's... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
MICHAEL ...I mean, exactly, you hit it right, hit that one right on the head. 

00:15:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:15:10
MICHAEL  That it's just, yeah, uhm, as, regret, I suppose just. 

00:15:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
MICHAEL You know, let's say that's what happens, uhm. 

00:15:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Well, one of the things that happens, I think a lot of times with anger, is that it's a stronger sort of front for more vulnerable feelings like pain or fear. And you might discover that as you become better at lowering your anger, you might become more aware of sadness. And, uhm, that that, that that may be a process, a helpful process to go through in the process of grieving and letting go to get into your anger, but also past it, so you can experience the sadness and then, work through it... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
MICHAEL I like that. 

00:15:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...and, and be able to really let go of it in a, in a complete way. 

00:16:00
ASSESSMENT OF SESSION WITH "MICHAEL" 

00:16:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Jan, in reflecting on your session with Michael. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Hmm. 

00:16:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What went best in that session? 

00:16:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. I thought that it represented a typical counseling session with a first time client and also illustrated very well a cognitive counseling routine that I often, in going through with my clients. The routine involves maybe 10 or 11 steps, beginning with emphatic listening then, uhm, when I formulated the problem in my mind pretty well, I'll begin by, ah, reflecting feelings, in this case, betrayal; defining the problem, in this case, the reduction of anger; and then, uhm, get, getting concrete, asking the client to think back to a recent situation when they were feeling this way. Then, I ask them to freeze the frame back in that memory and identify what was going through their mind at the time, in the way of thoughts or images. And this is where the cognitions are generated. Then, uhm, I'll use some kind of disputation strategy. In this case, I used a variation on becoming the neutral observer. And then, ah, ah, out of this will come reformulated cognitions which I'll then, ah, try to reiterate in the form of an immediate experience for the client to experience the old way of thinking, and therefore, feeling or acting in the new way, ah, in a very, uhm, clear, ah, comparative sort of and very immediate type of way. And then, ah, finally an anchoring procedure. In this case, I asked the client to mentally rehearse similar situations as the distressing one, practicing the new thinking. 

00:17:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What other comments would you like to make about this session? 

00:18:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Well, three thoughts come to mind. One is that, ah, typical of a first time client, Michael did a lot of emotional perseverating and, ah, for example, when I asked him what was going through his mind, ah, uhm, in the way of thoughts and images, he came back with the feeling of hate, ah, rather than contradict him and say, ah, ah, " You're saying a feeling and I asked for a thought or an image." Ah, the typical way to deal with that is to reflect the client's feelings and then redirect them back to the routine. Uhm, another thing that is, ah, more frequently seen in, ah, early counseling sessions was Michael's incongruence between verbal and non-verbal expression. And, ah, for example, when he would smile, ah, when he was saying that he felt angry, rather than confront this at this very early stage in the counseling relationship, I decided simply to remain congruent myself. Uhm, and the last thing is that, ah, I was glad that I was able to address what Michael came in with and, and wanted to work on, which was anger. But I also saw very early on that, ah, this was really, ah, only part of the deeper grieving issue. So I'm glad that at the end I was able to bring in, ah, some possibilities, ah for him to consider as he continues to address this issue. 

00:19:25
"SALLY" SECOND SESSION WITH A MIDDLE-AGE ADULT 

00:19:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Well, Sally, this is your second time here and last time, we were going over a lot of housekeeping details about the structure of counseling and our mutual expectations and so forth. I just wondered if you had any questions arise between last week and this week about that sort of stuff. 

00:19:50
SALLY Hmm. Not that I can think of. 

00:19:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Okay, good. Well, then, ah, we can get right into, ah, what you're here in counseling for and I think we labeled the general issue as, "assertiveness"... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
SALLY  Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...last week. So, I wondered if there was any incident that occurred this past week that we could focus on to begin working on this? 

00:20:10
SALLY Yeah. There is. Uhm, I have a good friend that's getting a divorce. He's just started the procedures, and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
SALLY ...he called last week and he wanted to talk about how he was feeling. 

00:20:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
SALLY And, I was super busy that day. And so, I told him that, that I was busy and I couldn't talk to him right then. 

00:20:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
SALLY And, that still didn't feel good. If, after I hung up on, I just didn't like the way I felt at all about it. 

00:20:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So, actually, I think, before we focus on your feelings, which will be an important thing to do, that, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN it sounds like you did take a risk to, ah, express your, your need in the situation and ask for what you want. So that was a step in itself. It sounds like... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
SALLY Yeah. 

00:20:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...you, you pushed yourself a little bit to do that. But now, resolving those feelings might be helpful to you. Okay. So if you could, sort of go back in your mind to that time right after the phone call, when you start to notice that you're not feeling really good. And you could put a label on what the feeling is, what would it be? 

00:21:15
SALLY Hmm. Guilt. I felt really guilty that, that he was in need and I wasn't there for him. 

00:21:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
SALLY I was too busy. 

00:21:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So, now this is a good example of the, uhm, the approach to counseling that I use because you just revealed not only a feeling but also a thought that was sort of feeding the feeling. 

00:21:40
SALLY Hmm. 

00:21:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN The feeling was guilt. And the thought was, " I should be there when he needs me." 

00:21:45
SALLY Hmm. 

00:21:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Okay. 

00:21:45
SALLY  Yeah. 

00:21:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN You know, in fact, maybe it would be helpful if we try, ah, uhm, a strategy that's called, "the triple column technique." And as we go through this, uhm, I'm hoping that, that you'll not only be able to benefit from it in this particular situation, but learn the triple column technique as a resource that you can use whenever you do experience some, ah, distressing feeling that you think might be, uhm, uhm, reducible if you work through it a little bit, okay? 

00:22:15
SALLY  Okay. 

00:22:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uhm, it uses this form. And as you can see, the, the first step is to describe the upsetting event. And it sounds like in your case it was that, uhm, "I" uhm, "turned away a friend in need." How does that sound, as if, general? 

00:22:35
SALLY  Yeah. It's exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. 

00:22:45
SALLY How it. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. 

00:22:45
SALLY What happened. 

00:22:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN What happened. Okay. And, " negative feelings" you'll notice that several, ah, feelings are listed here because these are the ones that people struggle with the most. And you did mention, "guilty" which is one of those. (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So, uhm, you were feeling guilty and on a scale from like one-low to ten-high, how guilty were you feeling? Ten being the most guilty you've ever felt or could imagine feeling. 

00:23:10
SALLY I was feeling pretty guilty, a nine. 

00:23:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN A nine? Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
SALLY Yeah. 

00:23:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So, a nine out of ten. And, it didn't sound like it, but I just wanna check whether there was any other emotion that was, ah, troubling you at the time. 

00:23:25
SALLY  Not, not that I can think of. 

00:23:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN That was really the main thing? 

00:23:30
SALLY Yeah. 

00:23:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. And one of the thoughts that you had was, "I should be there to help him." Okay. And I wonder if you could just expand on that a little bit more? Any other, any other thoughts associated with that? 

00:23:50
SALLY Hmm. He needed me. 

00:23:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN He really needed you? (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
SALLY He did. His voice sounded, uhm, like he's pretty upset. 

00:24:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So, "He, he was really needy." Ah hmm, okay. 

00:24:10
SALLY Oh, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Controlling(ph) with it a little bit. 

00:24:10
SALLY Well, and, I guess I felt like I'm his only friend. 

00:24:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
SALLY And, he was reaching out to me, and I, I wasn't there for him. 

00:24:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So, uhm, almost like, " I'm his only resource. His only friend." (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN "His only, uhm, resource. And without me," how would you complete that thought? 

00:24:35
SALLY Hmm. Well, without me, he, oh no, he might, I don't think, I'd think he'd hurt himself but, it might take him longer to get back to normal than if I were there for him. 

00:24:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Do you have any sense of, ah, I'm just checking this out, 'coz no, is a perfectly acceptable answer. But do you have any sense of a thought or image of him just being stuck in his misery and, uhm, not having any other way to get out? 

00:25:00
SALLY  I guess I do, 'coz I really think I'm, I am his only friend. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN His only friend. 

00:25:10
SALLY Yeah. 

00:25:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN His only resource. Okay. So, "Without me he's, he'll be stuck in his misery." 

00:25:15
SALLY  Yeah. 

00:25:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Now, I would, I'd like to read these to, one at a time and kind of keep a, a barometer of your guilt. And which one seemed to really, you know, catch you. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
SALLY  Okay. 

00:25:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay? Uhm, "I should be there to help him." "He was really needy." "I'm his only resource." "Without me, he'll be stuck in his misery." 

00:25:45
SALLY Hmm. And one of those? 

00:25:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, well, ah, it doesn't have to be just one, but do, one or two of them seem to kinda get you a little bit more than others? (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SALLY Yeah, "Without me, uhm, he'll be stuck." 

00:26:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. 

00:26:00
SALLY And, "I should be there to help him." 

00:26:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And so, "I should help him." 

00:26:05
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. All right, now, uhm, one of the things that, that, ah, can be helpful is to identify what kind of distortion is going on. And, uhm, there are 10 major or most typical ways that people kinda tend to get a little messed up in their thinking. And so, these, and a lot of times, the, the thoughts that feed, ah, intense feelings, uhm, do, are characterized by one or more of these cognitive distortions. 

00:26:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN During this part of the session, Sally and I reviewed the cognitive distortions. We looked at whether each one related to her belief that her friend would remain miserable. We identified three distortions that seemed to relate. One was, "all or nothing thinking," the belief that her friend was totally miserable. Another was, "jumping to conclusions," imagining him continuing to be just as miserable, indefinitely. And the third was, "personalization," holding herself personally responsible for his misery that actually was the result of a lot of other factors. 

00:27:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Okay so, the fact that, that you were able to identify some kind of distortion suggest that this might be an exaggerated thought. So, let's look at the evidence. If you could kinda step away from this belief that, "Without me, he'll be stuck in his misery... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN How does that stand up to your experience with him? 

00:27:40
SALLY Well, I know, later in the week that he called and I wasn't there, he left a message on the recorder. And, he sounded like he was, uhm, back in that same spot again. 

00:27:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
SALLY And I just couldn't get there for eight to 10 hours. 

00:27:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
SALLY I didn't check my messages and I was gone. And, then when I finally got in touch with him, he was okay. 

00:28:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh. 

00:28:00
SALLY  So. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So over the course of that eight to ten hours, he somehow found some resources to, to bring himself out of his bad mood? 

00:28:10
SALLY Yeah, without me. 

00:28:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Without you. 

00:28:15
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. That's it. I think that's a real important thought to focus on. That when in the past, when I haven't been there, he has managed without me and he hasn't stayed miserable, okay? 

00:28:25
SALLY Yeah. It's hard to remember whenever he's on the other side of the phone. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yes. Yes. At the moment that you're hearing his tone of voice, you might have a tendency to slip back into your old way of thinking, which is, "Oh, he needs me and without me, he'll be miserable forever, so I should be here right now." 

00:28:45
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, I think of that kind of thinking as, ah, kind of habit or rut, that you might have gotten used to thinking that way. 

00:28:55
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, that, ah, if you find that, that this new thought, it helps you to feel better and seems to really be more reasonable, make more sense, you can actually practice reminding yourself of this at times when he's not right there on the phone. 

00:29:10
SALLY  Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So that when he does get on the phone, if you are in a situation where, you really need to take care of something else, you'll have this new way of thinking, practiced a little better. You won't slip into that rut so easily. You'll be able to stay on a new path that's... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
SALLY  Hmm. 

00:29:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN A little bit, uhm, more helpful. Well, before we decide if you really wanna do this, let me do a little thing, sort of like in the movies, if you ever seen, take one, you know, take two? 

00:29:40
SALLY Yeah. 

00:29:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, and I'd like you to just, ah, again, focus on how you're feeling as you hear, ah, these two, ah, different, ah, takes, okay? Take one, uhm, "I should be there to help him. He's really in need right now. I'm his only resource, and without me, he'll just be stuck in his misery. I should help him." 

00:30:05
SALLY Hmm. 

00:30:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay? What's happening? 

00:30:10
SALLY Well, I felt heaviness in my chest and, uhm, I feel really, ah, responsible. 

00:30:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. So you feel that the weight of responsibility, kinda of a pressure or heaviness in your chest? 

00:30:20
SALLY Yeah. 

00:30:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Okay. And guilt? 

00:30:25
SALLY Yeah. 

00:30:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Ver, okay, that really... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
SALLY Yeah. 

00:30:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  brings up your guilt. 

00:30:30
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. All right, so, ah, let's, let's clear the slate now. Yeah, I see you start taking a little breath like, yeah, good. And, now we'll do take two, uhm, "In the past, when I haven't been available, he has managed okay. He's somehow found some resources that I don't even know about to, ah, support himself. And so, ah, I don't have to be there every minute. I'll still be there when I can. But at, in those times when I can't be there, or don't choose to be, I can know that he's making it okay on his own." 

00:31:05
SALLY  Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay? What happens, to you, your face looks different? 

00:31:10
SALLY Yeah, I feel, uhm, freer. Probably like, I could be a better friend just not responsible and none of the guilt feelings. 

00:31:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. So your guilt, in fact, if you had to say no, from that scale from one to ten, how, where would you put your guilt, when you think, that take two? 

00:31:30
SALLY Hmm. Probably as low as two. There's still a little bit in there. 

00:31:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Still a little bit in there? 

00:31:35
SALLY Yeah. 

00:31:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN I think, ideally, you'd like to be there whenever he needs you. 

00:31:40
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And so, there's that little part that will always, that little twinge, that will always be there. 

00:31:45
SALLY Yeah. 

00:31:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN But there's a big difference between like a nine and a two. 

00:31:45
SALLY  Okay. 

00:31:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay, you can live with a lot more easily. 

00:31:50
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Now, let me ask you, second question. Sounds like take two helps you to feel better, which of these thoughts now being really objective and really honest seems to be more really true, make more sense, that, uhm, he's, he's really needy, he's miserable, he'll never, he'll just go on being miserable, you know, and all that stuff or that, he, ah, has in the past found the resources to support himself when you haven't been right there? 

00:32:20
SALLY  Hmm. The second one. 

00:32:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN The second one? 

00:32:25
SALLY Yeah. 

00:32:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So this is what I call, a sort of a "litmus test" of, uhm, crooked and straight thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN The crooked kind of thinking tends to really bring about unnecessarily, uhm, distressing feelings and when you step back and really examine them, they don't make as much sense as other thoughts that are just sort of reformulated, modified a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, and help you feel better and make more sense. Okay. Now, there's a second part of the situation, I'm wondering whether it occurred to you, ah, to, uhm, say something to him about this kind of situation? 

00:33:05
SALLY  Hmm. I guess I'd like to. It would be nice to be able to do that. 

00:33:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN You would. You'd like to but instead, it sounds like you maybe have thought about that but some, somehow you've stopped yourself. 

00:33:20
SALLY Yeah. 

00:33:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN How do you stop yourself when you think about saying something to him? 

00:33:25
SALLY Well, I don't. He's a good friend. I don't wanna hurt his feelings. 

00:33:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Okay. So, you don't wanna hurt his feelings or, uhm, communicate in any way that you're, that you're, that you don't want to talk to him or that you're really trying to turn him away in any big way. 

00:33:40
SALLY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:33:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Okay. So, uhm, I wonder if you'd be willing to try out here a, uhm, a couple of dry runs to see whether you might be able to say something to him. And, uhm, and sort of clear the air about these kinda situations at the same time that you don't really... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
SALLY Hmm. 

00:34:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...you know, communicate anything you don't want to. 

00:34:05
SALLY Yeah, I'll give that a try. 

00:34:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. When you say, "I'll give that a try," I see you wrinkle your nose a little bit. Uh-huh. What's, what's, what's happening in... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
SALLY I'm just a little, I just feel some anxiety about it. 

00:34:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, some anxiety. Even here, even when he's not here... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
SALLY Yeah. 

00:34:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...just the idea of saying something, like this and maybe being misunderstood. 

00:34:20
SALLY Yeah. 

00:34:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, brings, okay. Well, this is the kind of anxiety that I think if, uhm, you're willing to just stay with it and go through it, you might find something at the other end that can help you. We'll see. It's kind of an experiment. 

00:34:35
SALLY Okay. 

00:34:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. So, uhm, maybe I'll set up a, a scenario where we're talking on the phone another time and, ah, after the, that incident happened and, uhm, a lull has come in the conversation and, ah, this is an opportunity for you to bring up this, this subject. 

00:34:55
SALLY Okay. Oh, whenever you call, I sure, I wanna be here for you, but I'm not alway, I don't always have the time that, that, that you need or that I'd like to give you, so, ah, I'd like to let you know that ahead of time. 

00:35:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Okay. So let's stop there. What did you like about what you've, what you said? 

00:35:25
SALLY That I actually said something. 

00:35:25
SALLY But... (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, it feels kinda like a victory to just get something out. 

00:35:30
SALLY Yeah. 

00:35:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. And, what else? 

00:35:30
SALLY Uh hmm. That I'm trying to let him know, that I will be here for him. 

00:35:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. Yeah, you started with you'd like to be there for him whenever he calls. 

00:35:45
SALLY Yeah. 

00:35:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. And, uhm, so you started with that, sort of caveat so that he, he won't misunderstand anything else that comes. 

00:35:50
SALLY Yeah. 

00:35:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. Anything else that you liked? 

00:35:55
SALLY No. No. 

00:35:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Anything that you didn't like about it? 

00:36:00
SALLY It seemed real abrupt and straight to the point. 

00:36:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Okay. Kind of like out of the blue, you suddenly start talking about this and, and he might wonder where you're coming from. 

00:36:10
SALLY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Actually, that was an ex, ex, ah, an experience that I had as I listened to you. I was pleased to hear you saying these positive things about... (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
SALLY Hmm. 

00:36:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  wanting to be there and everything, but I was asking myself, "Where did this come from?" 

00:36:20
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So, do you have any idea about how you might ease into it? 

00:36:25
SALLY Hmm. No, I guess I could use the phone call that and let him know that, ah, when I did talk to him and I told him that I, ah, wasn't available right then... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
SALLY ...rhat I had some feelings later of, I felt guilty... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
SALLY ...about it. And, ah, that I really did wanna be there for him. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
SALLY I could use that. 

00:36:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay that sounds, that sounds really good, ah, to me. Why don't you go ahead and try it. Let's do... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
SALLY Okay. 

00:36:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...our own take two. 

00:36:55
SALLY Okay. Uhm, last week when we talked, I didn't have time to visit with you. 

00:37:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:37:00
SALLY And I just wanted to let you know that, ah, I really was busy but I, but at the same time I really was interested with what was going on with you. And after we hung up, I didn't feel so good about not being there for you. And, oh, maybe next time I'll, I can let you know, if I have time or not. And I just want you to know I really care what's going on... (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
SALLY ...with you. 

00:37:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Okay. Yeah, what, what, wha, what is that reaction? 

00:37:30
SALLY It's just scary to tell, to be, (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN To be that direct. 

00:37:35
SALLY Yeah. 

00:37:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. What are you afraid might happen if you said that to him? 

00:37:35
SALLY Hmm. I guess, that he might not call back or... (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
SALLY ...we might not be friends anymore. 

00:37:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
SALLY Some of that stuff. 

00:37:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN That he still will misunderstand? 

00:37:45
SALLY Yeah. 

00:37:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. You know, one of the things that you might consider doing is tagging on to, after you've said what you just said, say, "I feel a little scared to say this to you... (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...'coz I'm afraid that you might misinterpret, that I'm trying to give you some kind of subtle message not to call, and that is not what I'm, what I'm trying to do. I just wanna clarify that on those occasions when I can't talk to you. It's not because I don't care. It's because something really, uhm, pressing is on me at that time. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And that, uhm, I will get back to you and, ah, at a time when I can really focus on you and give you the kind of attention that I'd like to." 

00:38:25
SALLY Hmm. That sounds good. 

00:38:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:38:30
SALLY You wanna call him? 

00:38:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. I know. Well, you know, one of the things that you can learn from hearing me is that, uhm, I didn't know I used to be this articulate and I've learned to be more direct and, and talk about my fears about being open with people, to people to clear the board. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
SALLY Hmm. 

00:38:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And those sorts of things. So, everything that I'm doing is stuff that I've learned and I think that you can too. And, uhm, so, now when you imagine doing this next week, okay, first of all, how anxious do you feel, on that scale of one to ten? 

00:39:00
SALLY Hmm. I feel, uhm, maybe a four or five. 

00:39:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh, four or five. Okay. So, that's pretty, that's, ah, that's sounds manageable to me. Does that feel manageable to you? 

00:39:15
SALLY Yes, it does. Uh-huh. 

00:39:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So that maybe despite the anxiety, you might go ahead and give it a try. 

00:39:20
SALLY Yes. 

00:39:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Good. Now, if you do you feel you're anxiety rising, you might try doing one of these, uhm, triple column things. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
SALLY Hmm. 

00:39:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, ah, instead of the upsetting event as a past event, a future event, and what you're... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
SALLY Hmm. 

00:39:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...feeling is anxious, and then what you're telling yourself. 

00:39:40
SALLY Okay. 

00:39:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, and see what kind of distortions you noticed happening and, ah, and then take those thoughts, distance yourself, evaluate how realistic they are. Try to formulate more realistic thoughts and then, and write those in your last column and then see if that doesn't help reduce your anxiety so you can do a little... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
SALLY Okay. 

00:40:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...more effective job. 

00:40:00
SALLY Okay. 

00:40:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay? And also, let me say that a lot of times, when clients start using this, they get stuck at different places. So, uhm, we've covered a lot today, and if you find that, when you actually get in a situation you're really not quite ready and, and you're not able to use this as effectively as you'd like to... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  then, uhm, just hold it and we'll get to it next week 'coz it's not that something that has to be addressed this week. 

00:40:30
SALLY Okay. 

00:40:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay? So, uhm, I wonder if you'd review for me what, uhm, was most important to you from our session today. 

00:40:40
SALLY Hmm. I think the idea that I can, uhm, control some of my thoughts, uhm, that I don't have to keep thinking the same way. 

00:40:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
SALLY And, uhm, that's really encouraging to me. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
SALLY And the idea that I can be direct with my friend... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
SALLY ...and not hurt him. 

00:40:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
SALLY  And letting him know how I feel was ah, a great idea. 

00:41:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay, good. So, it sounds like you, you anticipate a feeling of a little freer to be able to influence your thoughts and thereby influence your feelings. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And also be more direct and be able to sort of clear, ah, clear things up, in, in possible misunderstandings with people. 

00:41:20
SALLY Yeah. 

00:41:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Good. That sounds great. Well, I'll be anxious to hear next week how you did. 

00:41:25
SALLY Okay. 

00:41:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN All right. 

00:41:25
ASSESSMENT OF SESSION WITH "SALLY" 

00:41:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Jan, your session with Sally has just ended. In assessing that session, what things did you like best about it? What went best in that session, from a cognitive counseling point of view? 

00:41:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Well, I was really pleased to be able to use the Triple Column Technique and, uhm, use David Burns' form. Ah, I found that a lot of clients really benefit from learning that strategy and do use it themselves and become their own therapist, and since that's one of the goals of cognitive counseling, to get the client in a place to be able to help themselves a lot, uhm, I, I felt good about being able to do that. And another thing I liked about the session was that, uhm, as I see it, whenever a distressing situation arises, there are sort of two avenues that can be taken. One is to change myself, to change the external situation, and that's what I really addressed with Sally second, about becoming more assertive to clear the air in her relationship with her friend. And then the other is to change myself, so that I react to the external situation differently and that's what I addressed with Sally first about identifying, examining and reformulating her beliefs that were leading her to feel so guilty. And what I liked about the session is that in, in the session, we were able to get to both of those things, which I think is the ideal treatment of any kind of situation. Usually, both components are there and we were able to address both. 

00:43:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. What would you do differently or how would you do the session differently? Or what, what didn't go as well in the session from a cognitive counseling point of view as you see it? 

00:43:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Well, actually, although, this isn't contrary to co, to cognitive counseling. It's one of the things that I don't prefer, which is, ah, that at the beginning, because so much of the approach involves teaching, I tend to be more verbal and tend to dominate the early sessions. Then as the client learns the strategies more, they become much more active and I play a much, much more of a role of a guide rather than the active teacher. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN So, uhm, uhm, I, it's one of those unrealistic things where I just wish that we could be a few sessions down the road and Sally could have been more, ah, active... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...in her own process. 

00:44:05
"ED" SIXTH COUNSELING SESSION WITH AN OLDER ADULT 

00:44:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Well, Ed, when you left last time, you were planning to attend a, a seminar for newly divorced people. How did that go? 

00:44:20
ED Well, uhm, thanks to your encouragement. I had thought about going and not going, but I did go. 

00:44:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Oh. 

00:44:30
ED And, ah, but I found I didn't stay, I was distracted. 

00:44:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Huh? 

00:44:30
ED I have had, ah, I guess quite a lot going on since I saw you last time. 

00:44:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh. 

00:44:35
ED Ah, I found out last week that I had some polyps in my colon. 

00:44:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh, really. 

00:44:40
ED And I guess two days ago, I had those removed and I'm waiting two more days now for lab results, they're doing a biopsy on them. 

00:44:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh. 

00:44:50
ED  Although the, ah, the doctor told me, you know, just from visual appearance, it doesn't appear to be serious, there is still that question and it's one of those things that, ah, I'll be doing other things, and I find that it comes in from outside, you know and... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm, I see. 

00:45:10
ED ...it's in my head and I'm thinking about it, ah. 

00:45:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. You'll find that you're a little preoccupied with that. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
ED Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN It, sort of, intrudes into, (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
ED Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  uh hmm, and distracts you. 

00:45:20
ED I think part of that is maybe enhanced by virtue of the fact that, ah, a year ago, my brother had, ah, surgery and had, ah, prostate cancer. 

00:45:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Oh. 

00:45:35
ED And had surgery for it and has been through the, ah, x-ray treatment and you know, (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
ED he, he's doing okay now. It's all clear. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Well, that's good. 

00:45:40
ED But having that in my mind, then makes me wonder, well, now, what's gonna happen with me, even though, we don't have much of a history of cancer in the family... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
ED ...there's still that, that outside possibility. 

00:45:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah, yeah. So, part of your preoccupation is concerned with what the ma, the re, the test results might be and the fear that the polyps might not be benign, but maybe cancerous. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
ED That's a possibility. 

00:46:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:46:10
ED I think, I think that's part of it, (laughs) and as you know me, I think there's another part of it, ah, this is something that's out of my control when I'm sitting and waiting... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:46:20
ED ...and I don't wait very well. 

00:46:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Uh hmm. You want the answer right away. 

00:46:20
ED Uh-huh. 

00:46:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:46:25
ED And, and that even in thinking about it, one of the interesting things that I have been aware of is knowing that there is the outside possibility that I might have to have surgery. (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:46:35
ED And thinking of that also and what that would do to my schedule. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
ED I have, I have operate on a fairly tightly scheduled, ah, work schedule. 

00:46:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
ED So, thinking, well, now, if I have to be out. 

00:46:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Yeah. 

00:46:55
ED And you don't have to contact or get to cover this for me and what I do with, ah, other situations. (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. It's... (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
ED Knowing in my head that all of that can work very easily, but still letting that kind to take over. 

00:47:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. So it's, it's a little bit distracting to you to, uhm, to be planning ahead and, and, ah, trying to figure out how you'll handle it if some of these contingencies arise. 

00:47:20
ED Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:47:25
ED And, and at the same time, I know, it's kinda fruitless. 

00:47:25
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. 

00:47:25
ED Ah, because it will work if it comes to that. 

00:47:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:47:30
ED I've got a couple of days to wait to find out if it's going to. 

00:47:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:35
ED But yet, again, as I guess, I describe it, that creeping in effect. 

00:47:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Right. You know, what seems to be happening is that in a, in a subtle kind of way, you're doing sort of a cost-benefit analysis of, of the value of worrying or planning, you know, for these different contingencies and it sounds like on the one hand, one of the benefits that you experience is that it does bring you some relief to think about how you would handle the different details. And one of the cause is that you're having trouble concentrating on the matters at hand from moment to moment. 

00:48:10
ED Exactly. Both of those are true. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Both of those are true. 

00:48:10
ED  because if I were to, I guess to be 100 percent honest, I pretty well have planned out... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:48:20
ED ...in the event that, that should occur, what I need to do. 

00:48:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh-huh. And yet you find that you continue to, ah, be preoccupied with that. 

00:48:25
ED  Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Almost, uhm, I am wondering if part of that is reviewing things that you have decided and kind of working through them again to make sure you've gotta. (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
ED I guess it may be, but it just occurred to me that one of the things I'm doing in that process... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:48:45
ED ...is doing it in a very haphazard fashion. 

00:48:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Huh. 

00:48:50
ED That, that's where the creeping in comes in. 

00:48:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yes. 

00:48:55
ED Where if, if maybe I set aside some time... (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ED ...to do that kind of planning... (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ED  then maybe, there would be less of that invasiveness. 

00:49:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Yes. Yeah. That sounds like a good idea, to set aside specific time to, to let yourself think about this sort of thing, and also, since you talked about the disorganize, disorganized quality of it, being part of the problem, maybe writing down some of the things too and getting it a little organized on paper, so that you know you'll have that resource to turn to if the situation arises. 

00:49:30
ED  I could do that and that's something that, that I do, do in other situations. 

00:49:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN  Uh-huh. Yeah. I saw you looking over here a little bit like you're remembering having done that before, so that, that seems to have worked for you. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ED I guess I was looking over there remembering and also planning... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh-huh. 

00:49:50
ED ...because I think, I think, that's something that would be pretty easy to do and incorporate... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
ED ...in my own life. 

00:50:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
ED Like I was thinking, ah, as I get ready for work each day. 

00:50:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
ED One of my habits is when I get up, I turn on the radio. 

00:50:10
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
ED And I've got a sport show that I listen to every morning. 

00:50:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
ED And that's usually on while I'm getting ready and eating breakfast and everything prior to work. And that might be a time to maybe change that, turn that off and have more quiet time and more planning time. 

00:50:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Good idea. And maybe have a pad of paper that you have some place or carry with you so you can jot things down as you think about them and then maybe when you sit down until you actually eat, you can organize things even more closely. (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
ED Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
JANICE MINER HOLDEN That sounds like it really, ah, it probably will help. The other side of it is, ah, that if you do find in the middle of some other activity that, ah, that, that these kinds of concerns are still intruding occasionally, there are probably a couple of things that you could do. Ah, since you are planning this, this time to plan, ah, and setting it aside everyday, you can remind yourself that you have that time and maybe even do, ah, a kind of thought stopping and say to yourself if, and you're in a situation where you can out loud stop or say to yourself, you know, if you're in a situation where you, it's not, you know, socially, ah, appropriate. Just stop and remind yourself, uhm, "I'll think about that tomorrow." Another possibility would be to carry a little pad with you so that if you do think of something new and you wanna remember it, you can write it down and then let go of it and refocus your attention on what's happening. 

00:51:50
ED Okay. Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Yeah. Good. Well, let's review, uhm, the things that, that you talked about doing. Setting aside, ah, time in the morning... (crosstalk) 

00:52:00
ED Uh hmm. 

00:52:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...uhm, with the radio off and maybe a pad nearby. 

00:52:05
ED Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
JANICE MINER HOLDEN And, uhm, and taking time to not only jot down ideas but organize your ideas and then during the day, if more thoughts do intrude to either jot them down or, uhm, try the thought stopping method and maybe both. You might jot it down and then, and then say, "I'm just not gonna think about this now," and... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
ED Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
JANICE MINER HOLDEN ...and bring, come back to it tomorrow morning. 

00:52:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  And that... (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING ...I wonder, as a cognitive counselor, how you would assess that session in regard to what went well in it. 

00:52:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Well, one of the things I liked about the session is that Ed, being a more advanced client, ah, was more active. And so, the balance of activity was closer to the ideal where, at least my memory of it was that we had about equal time of talking and maybe Ed did a little bit more. And, uhm, he, his activity indicated that he really does feel a sense of responsibility and, and, ah, involvement in this process. Uhm, and I think because there was that involvement, we kinda went back and forth with different ideas and kind of piggybacked on each other's ideas and that that really demonstrated the, the idea of collaborating with the client. And, uhm, in this case we weren't examining beliefs so much as coming up with alternatives to, uhm, to help his situation out a little bit. 

00:53:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. And in looking at that session, what would you do differently or what would you expand on? 

00:53:40
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. Well, uhm, because, for the purposes of demonstration we didn't use the cost-benefit analysis in as explicit away as I would have used it with an earlier client that might have been clearer to an audience seeing that for the first time. But the cost-benefit analysis, ah, I again use a, a form from David Burns that, ah, with the client the first or second time until they get a visual image of the process and can use it in a more informal way, as, as I did with Ed. Uhm, the other thing is, ah, that, ah, I realized afterwards that there was a really neat little cognitive concept that I neglected to use here that I could have which is the concept of compartmentalization where after he uses thought stopping, he compartmental, he imagines taking those worries and concerns and putting them in that compartment that exist in the morning when he's getting ready for work. And using that kind of visual image can reinforce just the sort of abstract concept of keeping the worrying in certain times. 

00:54:55
STRENGTHS, LIMITATIONS, AND THE FUTURE OF COGNITIVE COUNSELING 

00:54:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Jan, now that we've seen cognitive counseling in action, what are the strengths of this approach as you see it? 

00:55:15
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Well, I've identified five strengths. One strength is that cognitive counseling has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression and has application for a wide variety of client concerns. A second strength is that cognitive counseling is designed to be short-term but it can also be adapted to long-term counseling. A third strength of cognitive counseling is that it provides the practitioner with a wide variety of concrete strategies. These include thought stopping, cost-benefit analysis, and the Triple Column Technique. A fourth strength of cognitive counseling is that cognitive theory provides a basis for integration of techniques from a wide variety of approaches not only behavioral, but also experiential. And a fifth strength, as I see it, is that cognitive counseling is grounded in a research based that's strong and still growing. 

00:56:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Jan, along with the st, the strengths of cognitive counseling, there must be limitations too. What are some of those limitations as you see them? 

00:56:20
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Okay. Well, one limitation is that cognitive counseling does not adequately address the client's past from the point of view of some other approaches to counseling. Whereas, it's true that cognitive counseling does not see the addressing of the past to be necessary or sufficient for client change. It is sometimes helpful in facilitating cognitive shifts in the client and therefore, is not avoided in cognitive counseling. Another limitation is that cognitive counseling does not adequately address unconscious processes from the point of view of some other approaches and whereas the addressing of unconscious material is valued in some approaches, it's true that that is not seen to facilitate profound or lasting change in clients from the cognitive counseling point of view. A third limitation is that cognitive counseling is not appropriate for all clients. Ah, in order to benefit from cognitive counseling, a client has to be able to communicate and reason. So, cognitive counseling is not appropriate for clients evidencing severe developmental deficits, certain kinds of brain injury and clients who are in acute emotional crisis. One final limitation is a limitation that cognitive counseling shares with every other approach to counseling and that is, that it's really only effective with the client who's open to change. 

00:57:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Jan, one last question. 

00:57:55
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Uh hmm. 

00:57:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What do you see is the future of cognitive counseling? 

00:58:00
JANICE MINER HOLDEN Hmm. Well, cognitive counseling has been growing in popularity and probably will continue to grow. I think that's because of the many strengths. Uhm, in addition to one I mentioned that the theory base of cognitive is broad enough to integrate strategies that originally grew out of other approaches, I also think that cognitive counseling techniques can be adapted to some other approaches. So, I think that the future of cognitive counseling looks quite bright.
