LIVING AND TELLING IN COMMUNITY

ERVING POLSTER, PhD & MICHAEL YAPKO, PhD 

00:00:40
MICHAEL YAPKO So let me get uh… get started with the very first question. Over the years as a tireless teacher of psychotherapy you have now, you've always emphasized group dynamics in your work but now you're looking beyond psychotherapy by providing this perspective of life focus groups. First, questions really multiple questions all on the same theme. What do you mean by life focus? And why it's so important in people's lives and then what does the transition like for you to go from psychotherapeutic treatment to a life focused treatment. 

00:01:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, if I can remember the whole thing you just asked me. Oh, I've heard it very clearly and… 

00:01:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Let's start away, what you mean by life focus? 

00:01:35
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, uh… what I mean by life focus is that it's very simple. It's apparent in the term itself pretty clearly in this… it means paying attention to life you're living. And it became a professional vehicle. When Freud discovered uh… that if people were mentally disturbed as they referred to it in those days that if you provided a situation in which people could unfold their lives that would help them to relieve some of the misery they were living with. Now, he was right about that but he incidentally happened in a few very powerful phenomena, which I don't think he saw at that time is, as much as important as simply the medical relationship in an office where you explore whatever is going wrong with the person but the phenomenon that he discovered was that if you get a setup in which people are free to be something they can't be anywhere else. And if you have a particular intensity of concentration on whatever anybody says, that you're gonna have a new enchantment with exploring how you live your life and new insights as he would have put it in those days, that would help to clarify and modify the way you're living. Well, we all know the history of that and he was very mixed in his understanding of what he was doing from this standpoint. He was very medically oriented, but it was really miffed that people wanted to be cured. So, like for example he once had a meeting with the (inaudible). In which he said that the people in the United States would never accept psychoanalysis. And Bedlam(ph) asked him why not needs as they expect improvement. That doesn't seem too much to expect when you have come into someplace where you're disturbed than you want improvement. But, he in spite of this sense that psychoanalysis was something more than a means for cure. He nevertheless got in… invested in the medical model. You might not think so from the standpoint of his having had controversy with the medical model and never having done the normal medical things in his office, but he do… he did want to stay in the office he wanted to be "scientific" and he was appalled that you on gonna wrong thinking that psychoanalysis was fundamentally a religious phenomenon and he wrote several books, showing how religion was a neurosis of the culture and how it was his business to modify that but he never took the steps that it would take to make it a communal event because he still kept it in the office so private that you wouldn't even know who came in before after you, when you went into psychoanalysis. I remember my first experience as a graduate student as a part of that, the postwar, medical forgotten what they call it but I was given 30 sessions free. I remember going into the psychoanalytic situation and walking into this office as German born umm… very bright, very attentive man and when I sat in the waiting room I felt like I was entering into this mysterious realm. Uh… I had no I was smart enough to know I had any problems at that point. All I knew was I wanted to find out what the psychoanalytic thing was about, they felt very mysterious and it was, but when I went in there and finally got in and I talked to him I discovered that this was a man who would listen to me. Moment after moment after moment, day after day after day, week after week after week and everything I said, seemed important to him. The reason I knew that was because when he said something which wasn't real often, it was always right on and I knew he'd been listening is a fantastic experience. Well, you don't have to be disturbed in order to value that kind of an experience. And I went on to try to explore the communal venue for psychotherapy but started in Cleveland, I left Cleveland and didn't go back to it but the field itself has been going on in that direction for a long time and I'll speak more about that later, but I want to say in relation to the concept of life focus. The light focus is a fundamental innate human function at it's deeper level as seeing, walking, talking, heavy sex, eating, it's at the same level of insistence and surely at the same level of survival that any of those are, we wouldn't be able to survive without life focus where we take it for granted. And rightly so because it would be an interference to be constantly aware of the process. Nevertheless this Life Focus function is challenged by the monumental flow of experience that comes into our lives and the integrative requirements for handling all that input from the world at large is almost unmanageable. In fact it is unmanageable, we do the best we can with it and what we do with most of it is put it into the background and what I describe in my book is what I'm referring to as the accessible hidden reasons of the mine, which is where much of the un-integrated, unaware phenomena that we process, go and resides in there and is available for avocation uh… along many different dimensions which will speak about I think that's about as much as I want to say in answer to your question, perhaps you… 

00:09:45
MICHAEL YAPKO You're… you're describing the need for reflection as a fundamental need of people that this is a basic drive and theoretically at least we would have some institutions that accommodate that now. What are some of the examples out there that you see, that seemed to be serving that need for reflection that you think of as being consistent with the aims of a life focused community. 

00:10:10
ERVING POLSTER Well, what I'm… what I'm describing is a phenomenon that's pretty highly developed in our society we see it especially powerfully in the mindfulness movement in meditation, in compassion groups, in self-help groups, we see it in everyday conversation, people telling each other the stories of their lives. 

00:10:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Stories of their lives. 

00:10:40
ERVING POLSTER We see it in the arts. I think there's a… I can't remember the exact numbers but in the year that I was exploring it, I think there is something like, 3 billion books sold in the United States alone, that doesn't even begin to take into account and although and… and most of those books are involved with life focused in one way or another many of them are in Art form, many of them are informational whichever way you go and I'm thinking more in terms of the… the arch form than the informational but they both apply, they are responding to this human need to go beyond one's own daily living to experience something of life that either accentuates how they're living. Well, it tells something about how they might otherwise be living or how they can go beyond the life they're living. So then if you add to the books that are sold, the art museums we go to, the movies we watch, the uh… 

00:11:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Churches… 

00:11:55
ERVING POLSTER Lectures began, the churches, the religions are an incredible source of this phenomenon I'm describing. Now it's true that many of us in psychotherapy or very wary about the term religion and we, I think all would agree that there are many aspects of religion which don't fit well with the psychotherapeutic modality and I would like to speak about that as we go on. But nevertheless, whether you like religion or don't like religion and I wanted to say that religion has managed to hijack or it's a supernatural has managed to hijack religion. So that we almost equate religion with supernatural and most religions have a large supernatural element most of the religions we know about even those that say, they don't deal with supernatural like Buddhism for example, Buddha is not a god, but if you read… if you read about Buddha everything you say about him sounds pretty godlike to me. But, be that as it may the number of people who go to churches I think in… in 2005, which is the less data that I had I think there were 335,000 churches in America. There were 20 to 40 million people who went to church every weekend. Now, you can say pros or cons about religion but you can't ignore the need that exists. And the need that exists in religion is not only a support for the supernatural but its support from community, from morality, from generally speaking an orientation and guidance in how you live your life and that's what religion is basically about orienting people and guiding people in how they live their lives. You remember what I said about the… the other incompressible flow of material that comes into our lives and how impossible it is for all of us to manage it all successfully. Somewhere along the line there has to be some orientation and guidance that keeps us focused, that keeps us joined, that keeps us moving forward, that doesn't fall apart that keeps us unified and all of those functions are indispensable functions. Every society has the most primitive society or the most advanced society, you might like what they do but you might hate what they do, but you know they do it because they've got to do it. And we've got to do a to all of us here have got to do it one way or another some of us are better equipped to do it without the communal support. That's fine I don't know whether I myself would join one of the groups I'm proposing. But that is not the point. Uh… I grew up religious, I was orthodox Jewish until I went to college I was pretty religious, and I haven't had much actual participation in religious experiences over the subsequent years except sometimes for either nostalgic or celebratory reasons, which always moved me very deeply and when I do go and I hear some of the music there are times when I could just cry out right there, it's so beautiful, it makes my day if I did it for another day it would make two days. 

00:16:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh, so you… you're talking about the… the spiritual guidance, the moral guidance or religion and talking about these life focus groups is in a sense providing either a substitute for the that or a compliment for that. How is the moral guidance of a life focus group gonna meet that need or the spiritual need of the group's members. 

00:16:25
ERVING POLSTER Of the group what? 

00:16:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Of the group's members. 

00:16:30
ERVING POLSTER Uh… Well, the first, see how… how can I get into that the… that's a fundamental thing and it rests on a new view of what psychotherapy uh… has to do and there are three things that I think need to be brought into the picture. One is design, the other is congregation, and the third is conger… a continuity. Neither of which exists within our psychotherapy circles. Now as far as design is concerned in psychotherapy when company comes to us for help, we listen to what they have to say. We want to know the individual life of the person we're talking to, we need to and we let that unfold in its own spontaneous way, well it's not exactly spontaneous if you're guiding it but there is equality of spontaneity that… that contrasts with pre… pre… pre-prep pre-planned process. When you deal with a large group you can't do that. So, if you have 100 people in a group you can't do that same kind of process that you have to design the… the group and in my book I do show some potential designs and they deal with the creation of thematic structure that response to what we all know people at large require, so I don't have to ask any particular person whether home is a factor their lives, I don't have to ask them whether disappointment is a factor in their lives, I don't have to ask them where the empathy matters in their lives, I don't have to ask them whether gratitude matters in their lives, I don't have to ask them where their generosity matters in their lives. Everybody is involved in these phenomena. So these groups we don't have to deal with individual need on that dimension. What we do instead? 

00:19:05
MICHAEL YAPKO You can just fill over it's okay. 

00:19:10
ERVING POLSTER What fill? 

00:19:10
MICHAEL YAPKO The cane, it's okay. 

00:19:10
ERVING POLSTER Oh, as long as it wasn't me. 

00:19:15
MICHAEL YAPKO You're… you're still there, you're still up. 

00:19:15
ERVING POLSTER You'd never could tell. Well… 

00:19:20
MICHAEL YAPKO I'll be sure to let you know. 

00:19:20
ERVING POLSTER Would you let me know… 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
ERVING POLSTER Whoops unless… 

00:19:35
MICHAEL YAPKO You're… you're on design now. 

00:19:35
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, so I don't have to ask questions about whether people are interested in those things so you might say, oh, so this is a grand communal thing and everybody is gonna think alike no not at all. Because the communal design I'm proposing combines themes which are relevant for everybody with opportunity for everybody to say what their life is in relation to that theme. So what we do is have a general sense of let's say home, which is one of the themes that I describe in the book. So I start… I started out the… the session with something I wrote once about what I've called primal familiarity which is not exactly home but it's close enough so that people don't have to think they have to talk about home… home… home… home primal familiarity is what I read to them and it was my strongly felt feelings about primal familiarity, then we had a group of four people come in front of the group of about 100 people and discuss what home meant to them and they each told each other and they each had very different views about home and none of it had anything, any similarity with what I described in what I've written about primal familiarity. So the fact that I had set a tone did not determine what they were going to be saying, they were free to say as they wish and they did and they're all different views about home meant to them. I can't describe that to you right now… 

00:21:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Let me ask you about that. 

00:21:20
ERVING POLSTER pardon me. 

00:21:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Let me ask you about that because you more than anybody know how difficult it is to run groups you've been running groups, your whole professional life. So how do you keep the focus of a life focus group with so much disparity in its members, how do you keep it progressive? How do you keep up positive? 

00:21:40
ERVING POLSTER Okay, that's a good question I… I'm gonna… I'm gonna move from the design factor to… to answer that question because I think it's very important one of the key things about these groups as I'm proposing them is that they are not therapy groups. Nobody is coming there for therapy, nobody comes there because they've got a problem. Oh, I'm… I don't mean that they have problems that's not the reason… 

00:22:10
MICHAEL YAPKO That's not the reason there they're… 

00:22:10
ERVING POLSTER The solution to the problem is not the reason for coming, the reason for coming is that we all have problems we all have wishes. Which is more interesting really than having problems we all have needs, we all have life purposes, we all life histories, we all have lives which are very hard to consolidated our minds. It's a very difficult thing to organize in your mind, what your life is about? It's a very important thing for many psychological reasons very abort but it's very difficult and it's not done in one moment you can't suddenly decide this is what my life is about and therefore and then write it out and then… then you're… you're pointed toward that that's not… that's not the way life experiences become registered. Okay, so the first thing that happens when it's not a therapy group and you make it very clear that people in the group are not there to help each other solve a problem. So they don't find fault with what somebody else is saying because that's not gonna get them where they really should be going and so on. So once you take the heat off that you're not dealing with disturbance, you're dealing with humanity, the responsibilities that we have in therapy are altered. Just as the responsibilities and religion are altered when you go to a religious… religious service, you're not going there to solve a post-traumatic stress disorder, and nobody expects it, nobody expects it, of course it is true that most religious services you also don't have the relationship among the people everything is vertical related either to live clergyman or to God. But, we're not doing it that way we're relating… we're relating two ways, we're relating to the group as a whole and to the individuals in the subgroups who have a chance to exchange their… their feelings about one another, so in this particular group one person reported and then people… Well, let me go back to what I started to say about the… this demonstration will therefore people showing something to the whole group of what could happen in a group and then I asked them to break into groups of three or four and then I played a song, a beautiful song written by Liv Johnson, a woman in San Diego who grew up in Tanzania and she wrote a song about Tanzania and she says a voice that is not quite Joan Baez, but it's not far from it and we played that music and music is something we in therapy never you ever… have you ever use music in your therapy group to a… to inspire people, to orient people, to affirm people. 

00:25:40
MICHAEL YAPKO To touch them. To touch people. 

00:25:45
ERVING POLSTER To touch people yes we wouldn't do that preferred it would be very difficult to do it with it's still do all the other things we're doing anyway the point is that in the group the music is inspirational and the people then talk to each other about what home that means I say home it could be any of a 100 different themes or a thousand different themes and every group would have probably different preferences about what themes they wanted to deal with, okay. Now to get to the second point, remember there are three points I made about the group, one was the… 

00:26:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Desire… 

00:26:25
ERVING POLSTER One was the desire and the second was congregation. Congregation, we need congregation one way or another. Many of us form our own congregations of people, we have are friends, we have our book clubs, we have our professional organizations, we have excuse me, we have our churches, uh… we have all kinds of ways of forming congregations we do not have, well, we do have we don't have as much we could have of congregations that are psychologically minded that deal with psychological issues not for purposes of solving any specific acute problem but of addressing life itself and then the third factor that I mentioned about this group is continuity. Now in psychotherapy during the days I was doing psychotherapy, everything was headed toward termination. Termination was great finale of therapy. Why termination should be commencer on, I mean termination should be the beginning. If you're terminated and in terms of the therapeutic advance you're prepared for life itself, but there's no congregation anymore for that because you're okay… you're okay you're terminated. So those are some, simple misconceptions from the medical model. And the medical model is a very powerful model because most of us work in offices or organizations which have offices. Now, one of the things that's important about the congregation of people and it will relate to processes like meditation and… and… and… and such. What I see in these groups is a convergence of minds. What happens is we have a if you have a group of 100 or a group of a thousand or group of whatever number, you have numerous people all focused on the same theme that is a powerful force from the standpoint of attention. There's something of the amplification of anyone say, any single person's attention by the knowledge that everybody in the room is attending to the same thing but in their own individual way. That's a big turn on, it's not a turn on in the sense of having some seizure or such, but it's a turn-on and sense of aliveness, of amplification, of feeling joined of, be feeling belonging, a feeling a part of something. It's a little bit like when you go to the theatre and you have a house full of people and one you start laughing everybody's laughing together is very different from if you're laughing alone. If you go to a football game and everybody is cheering at one time is a very different experience from whether you're at home and happy with what happened. And that amplification of experience is something that people crave because there is a quality of suppression of experience which cause for forms of amplification which will restore the true vitality that is within all of us. 

00:30:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, I love the idea of acknowledging people's need to belong, I like the idea of even a group identity that forms in a group like this. But I can't help but think about the cultural backdrop where we have people who are so self-absorbed these days that about as other oriented as they ever get is when they watch keeping up with the Kardashians and how do we get people who are not reflective, who are more self-absorbed to be even willing to engage in this kind of a community process. 

00:31:15
ERVING POLSTER We could empathize with them. 

00:31:20
MICHAEL YAPKO We could… 

00:31:20
ERVING POLSTER Uh… We could be patient while they finish what they're doing but the bottom line is we don't have the responsibility for making them the way we think would be better for them to be that's a big thing. And you can't set up a program where it's gonna satisfy everybody. So, if we wait until the time when everybody in the group will be benefited or nobody will be disappointed then it's never gonna happen but nothing would ever happen. And so, we have to accept what is not a therapeutic acceptance that there are some people who will not join up with the process, who either won't even want to come and if they do come they may be sources of difficulty but they're not the same kind of difficulty that you have in a therapy group because you're not expecting the same thing from them. 

00:32:30
MICHAEL YAPKO All right. 

00:32:30
ERVING POLSTER And they're not going to be the same kind of intrusion that they would otherwise be so if you get a person in one group of three, out of a… let's say a community of 100 or 200 people and the people in that group of three or four wish that person weren't there maybe next time they won't, they'll be in another group. Now I don't know how that would all evolve in terms of whether somebody in the final analysis might get left out. I don't have the answer to that problem that's a real problem but it's a problem with society I… I don't know what we do if we stop functioning until we get everybody functioning well. So, and I think and I must say that the scientific mode is partly responsible for this attitude in a very interesting thing I ran into recently. Uh… Martin Seligman, I'm sure you all know about him but he has established an astounding program for the military. Now I've read about it when they first put it out I… I'm not up to date on all of the recent findings but they found some positive results which they reported. I read just recently a report that was scathing about their research project here they are doing this huge project for the military that involves groups of people trying to establish resilience in the soldiers so that they were less susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder and other disorders that come from the combat experience and they're… they're doing a very, what shall I call it, dedicated, sincere job and it may be true that the results they reported were overplayed and I understand the importance of accounting for what you're doing and the importance of if the results are not representative of what's really happening, somebody has to call attention to that and see that it's rightly reported, but in this report the scathing report there was not one word about the astounding phenomenon of trying to get I don't know how many people it was millions of people to develop a greater sense of resiliency and the army was willing to explore that phenomenon, now why wouldn't they say in their report, you've not reported that correctly that standard deviation was wrong and this is overplayed and you didn't do that kind of control. Why wouldn't they also say, but we admire your… your maxie and doing this and the… the courage of the military to put out all of their energy and money to try to help this soldiers and if we can't do it this way, why don't you see if there were some… some people who did benefit and we can all agree their benefit and let's see what happened with them, let's do another research project and see what happens with them. No, they reported, the report was a scientific or they're responsible for was calling… calling out the fact that the data were not sufficiently rightly supported or reported. I think that there's hardly anything in life that's so good that it can be allowed to be arrogant enough to destroy a process which has promise. Even though not yet there and I think that was true as a matter of fact with Freud. Nobody approved Freud ever cured anybody. I don't know that we even know today whether anybody did. But there's a lot of evidence that therapy is a very valuable process the… the… the… the evidence has developed over the years and even now you probably would find some people who would think otherwise but preponderance of evidence is that psychotherapy helps people significantly. 

00:37:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Can I jump in here? 

00:37:20
ERVING POLSTER What do you think would have happened if in the year 1900. Somebody had said, you know this automobile thing you're doing, we guarantee you an… an… an a perfectly acceptable guarantees we guarantee you that every year if you keep on with this automobile. It will kill 50,000 people. 

00:37:50
MICHAEL YAPKO A year. 

00:37:50
ERVING POLSTER A year. What would you do? Well, you'd probably start safety factors earlier than you did. You'd probably have some testing earlier than you did, you might develop safer cars. Even now you might say, if you didn't care about the money factor we're not gonna have svelte cars, we're gonna have safe cars nobody's… you may not like driving the car, but nobody is gonna get hurt. You could do that if you wanted to but what I'm trying to say is, you can't. There are certain movements which are so inexorable that you if you don't get in line with it somebody else is gonna have their way of doing it. Now let's take for example, the astounding phenomenon of Facebook, in relation to what I'm calling, of Life Focus revolution and we have one, I'm talking to you as though what I'm telling you is new, it's not new at all. Is a tremendous movement in this country as well as around the world is based on what I'm calling Life Focus, what other people call it other things but it has no core, it's… it's a… it's a… it's a what do you call it when there's a… a anarch… its anarchistic, the facebook, you cannot ignore that the people using Facebook in the numbers they're using them and the purposes they're using them you cannot ignore that people need to do this kind of expression. You can say, I don't like people scolding each other on the internet. I don't like people calling each other names on the internet. I don't like this, I don't like that, we have to do something about that I understand that but when you have the huge numbers of people who are talking to each other on Facebook, you can't ignore what's going on out there people need it, they want it and we know from our theoretical base that it's fundamental in our makeup to have it, the only thing is we don't know how to do it. So we restrict ourselves to our offices we know how to do that and we may or may not be fully satisfied even with that, but still we're doing the best we can and it's a good enough to want to go on with it, but we must recognize that while psychotherapy was invented this dissolve misery. It is basically enchanting, it is a wonderful experience, how many of you have people in their misery whoever don't want to come to their therapy session? Now and then yes, most people who come to you for therapy would be very unhappy if you could sow up that day. 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:10
ERVING POLSTER One time when I was in (inaudible) I had a group and the Miriam and I were going to be going on a seven week trip in Europe and so, I was gonna be there and they said to me, 'Oh, we would like to meet without you.' So I said, sure go ahead. When I came back where they pissed with me, they said, we didn't realize how far we could get without you. And so they've discovered what they could do without me, it was beautiful. 

00:41:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Or if you ask me to let you know when there was only 15 minutes left because he wanted to be able to respond is that… 

00:41:55
ERVING POLSTER That all, that's left is when you get on a roll, you get on a roll… 

00:42:00
MICHAEL YAPKO My goodness! So we… we do have 15 minutes left or be able to respond… 

00:42:10
ERVING POLSTER I… I've only started. I wanted to tell you and I'm gonna take a couple of minutes, just a couple of minutes for this. 

00:42:20
MICHAEL YAPKO It's all yours. 

00:42:20
ERVING POLSTER I wanted to tell you about an overlap between psychotherapy and religious and supernatural. Four things, I'll just name them and say a word and you don't have you can think about it. There's certain ways that we do the same thing that the people who believe in supernaturalism do. Only we do it usually with less ambition more reality but we still do it for example, relational indivisibility. I don't know if can say in one sentence, God is relationally indivisible from people that's a part of the reli… religious lore that God is within all of us. Psychotherapy and gestalt therapy in particular has a concept of the contact boundary which says that people are indivisible from each other. That there's some way in which there is an impulse toward connectedness which is the throb that we live with and we make that a part of relationship and there are other aspects to relational indivisibility which relate to belonging, and dedication, and marriage, and friendship, and membership in a profession and all the many ways that we are relationally indivisible from other people, okay, so relational indivisibility is one factor that we can produce without the concept of the supernatural. Then we have extrapolation, the concept of extrapolation is fundamental and religion because they reveal very often with the concept of death was which is the ultimate end of extrapolation. Except that with the human mind we can extend extrapolation in a number of ways that don't involve life after death and I'm not gonna go into that now, but you can imagine what some of those would be. Then there's anthropomorphism, in anthropomorphism is natural to human beings, so human beings naturally will impute to the universe a humanistic, a human… a human oriented being called God, which represents the universe and then we have a sanctification. Now sanctification means that you take a timeout of everyday life where you're free of the rules of life and you can live more freely than you would in ordinary relationship. Religion surprises certainly God is totally forgiveness supplies it and we in psychotherapy in our setting that is sanctified the sense of being separated from every July we supply it. Well, I… I'm not gonna go into the details of that let's… let's end at that point see if they have any questions. 

00:45:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, its open it up to questions are there… are there microphones in here? No. 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:46:00
MICHAEL YAPKO On the way. 

00:46:05
ERVING POLSTER Thank you Michael. 

00:46:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Pleasure. All right. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN They'll have to come with two mikes. 

00:46:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, if… if you're willing to come up to the microphone here we need to be a louder for everybody to be able to hear it, great. 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Hi, thank you so much for your… for your words, can you hear me? 

00:46:40
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN I a lot of what you said really resonated and greatly appreciated it and is particularly interested in your approach to these groups and that they're not for problems, they're for wishes and aspirations and I, So I'm wondering how you umm… how you prepare the group for that? How you create structuring your group that… that's people now that… that's the purpose and that encourages them in that direction. 

00:47:25
ERVING POLSTER Well, it simply saying it is one way and then activating it as another but saying it means that when you orient people you tell them we're not here for psychotherapy, if you want psychotherapy we believe in psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is very good for people and there are many ways you can get psychotherapy. This is not a psychotherapy group. This is a group for uh… coming together with people to become enlightened about the lives you're living and to be able to exercise your mind and they find commonality of… of purpose to develop a… a moral principles to do whatever it comes to your minds about how we live our lives beyond the question of whether you have some acute disturbance that is not to say that we want to ignore the acute disturbance because we think it's very important to take care of acute disturbance and there are means for doing that, this is not what this is set up for. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you so wonderful… wonderful stuff we, this brought to mind does something in I'm from Sydney in Australia and we have a thing called, 'The Sunday Assembly.' And I don't know whether it's international or not, but it's… it's simply a secular group that gathers they… they say I'd like they… they often send a song sheet of some Bob Dylan song or something and they gather and they talk about subjects they… they preempt the subject and that's interesting, it was just that I thought of this and I wonder if that has any reflection on what you're talking about or any relevance or some thoughts… 

00:49:25
ERVING POLSTER I don't know the group you're talking about but there are many convening groups that have very diverse purposes that might fit what you're describing and here the beginning of exactly what the group was that there are many groups out there in the world that we don't know anything about and as I say the… the movement is a very anarchistic movement. 

00:50:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:50:00
ERVING POLSTER In the sense of no guiding, no guiding leadership and no guiding purpose and pretty much ignored by the field of psychology. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Right. So the idea with… with what you're talking is something that does have this not a therapeutic purpose but a psychologically beneficial purpose. 

00:50:15
ERVING POLSTER That's right. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's… I understand much better, thank you. 

00:50:25
ERVING POLSTER That's right. It's a quite a… I can't say exactly accidental that Freud discovered what the beginnings of what we're doing in a medical atmosphere but because he did have the opportunity provided by the medical situation that might not have come otherwise. So I'm not saying it's irrelevant but it's… it's a lesser purpose than the purpose I'm describing. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Umm… As I'm hearing the… the process you're describing, the purpose it reminds me of the direction that Carl Rogers life in work was heading at the end of his life and I remember the Tory movement if you remember that movement. 

00:51:10
ERVING POLSTER I didn't hear that. 

00:51:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Tory Movement. 

00:51:10
ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Carl Rogers work… 

00:51:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Carl Rogers work… 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN At the end of his life he had a similar umm… interests and he created movements and groups one of them called the Tory movement trusting, opening, waiting and… 

00:51:25
ERVING POLSTER I don't… I don't remember what he called them I remember he was experimenting with large groups and he uh… his… his frame of mind was… was not toward design. He liked things to unfold. 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN Yes, right… 

00:51:40
ERVING POLSTER Spontaneously… 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN Organically with the group… 

00:51:45
ERVING POLSTER But I… I don't think that can work in a large… in a large group situation and I… and I don't… I don't know a lot about it but I know security is I don't think it continued… what? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN The security is if you remember what happened and there was any connection any connection with what you're doing now. 

00:51:55
ERVING POLSTER What's that? 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN I was curious if you remembered what happened to that and if there was any connection with what you are now doing because there is some similarity. 

00:52:05
ERVING POLSTER Well, yeah I remember it is a very interesting happening but I don't remember it as a continuing development. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN The groups are you were talking about they had it in the 60s but with lot of the drugs and rock and roll. 

00:52:30
ERVING POLSTER What is she saying? 

00:52:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh, you had a lot of those groups in the 60s. 

00:52:35
ERVING POLSTER Oh, yeah, that's a very good point, that's a very good point, yeah. What was your question? 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN No. that was not question… 

00:52:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Just a comment… 

00:52:45
ERVING POLSTER Just a comment may I make a comment about your comment. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:52:50
ERVING POLSTER The 1960s, we had what we call the encounter group movement, it was a fantastic movement. In fact, Irvin Yalom wrote a book on encounter first fax a long time ago and it was a very prominent phenomenon in those days, but it was pretty chaotic the leadership was not assured in terms of quality or competence that the people's purposes were not clear and there was no continuity. It was all done pretty much on a… on a weekend workshop basis with the very little follow-up and there was a lot of attention then to confrontation and there are many things that happened that were not good for the… for the movement and it faded out and there were some things that happened during that time that is still going on like you take something like, yes it was started in those days and that was a very interesting phenomenon is still going on. Subsequently with what's called landmark and I think they have quite a large following around the world but as very mixed reactions in terms of benefits and a lot of it is very autocratic. As I understand it and it's very financially minded. So it is not available on a… on a regular basis but if you want to do groups, how much would it cost the person to come to a group like this or 100 people, it wouldn't have to cost very much for each person. It probably would be less than you'd pay to join a church but the financial aspect was important in the eastern landmark phenomenon, we're like, oh, I'm blanking on his name… 

00:54:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Tony 

00:54:50
ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:54:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Tony. 

00:54:55
ERVING POLSTER Tony… Tony Robbins. 

00:54:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Tony Robbins. 

00:54:55
ERVING POLSTER Tony Robbins, does some really quite remarkable work I've… I… I don't, I'm not in touch with the extent of his work but I've been to some of the things he's done and there are some very… very important developments that happened for the people in the group and it's… it's been very well done on the occasions I was there but, the Encounter Group movement is an example of a failure in a good method. Taken as a representation of the method. So that we don't see anything of encounter groups anymore very much when we see variations on the theme. Some of which I describe in the book. 

00:55:45
MICHAEL YAPKO This is gonna have to be the last question, quick question, quick answer. 

00:55:50
ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:55:50
MICHAEL YAPKO We have to wrap it up. 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN I… I was wondering if according to your description on the evolution of psychotherapy conferences and even this for much of conference correspond to the same idea of community art, do you really refer to communities like being a weekly meeting are. 

00:56:10
MICHAEL YAPKO The role of this kind of a meeting, the role of the evolution of psychotherapy meeting. Whether it can be this kind of discontinuous thing like this or there are needs to be a more regular. 

00:56:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, I… I said a strange thing this morning in the workshop I was doing wasn't exactly believing what I was saying but, I believe that I would be saying it, I was saying, if you're coming here to get something new you're probably not gonna get it. But if you're coming here to join in a joint celebration of all we know, and a joint meditation on the process of psychotherapy than you are in exactly the right place and now here you are all of us are here together, we are in a… in a sense in a joint meditation on a phenomenon that I happened to be describing in Michael's joining with me on it and uh… there's something about the convergence of our minds on this theme that matters. We don't know how much it'll matter but in the long run it's what ultimate developments are made up… made up. 

00:57:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay we'll end it there. Look, I uh… 

00:57:30
[sil.] 

00:57:40
MICHAEL YAPKO I think you can appreciate Erv's optimism and Erv's humanism. I certainly hope that you will get his book and read it and indulge yourself in some of that quality of thinking but I want to say thank you to you, if I want to say thank you all for attending it's been a pleasure. 

00:58:00
ERVING POLSTER And thank you and thank you Michael, it's a pleasure to be with you. 

00:58:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you everyone.
