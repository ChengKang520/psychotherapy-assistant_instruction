00:01:45
KIM OLVER Today I want to talk with you about counseling throughout the relationship cycle. We’re going to help you teach your clients to love themselves their partners and their lives. In that order. So when I was doing the research for my book, Secrets of Happy Couples, I discovered this relationship cycle. And there’s four stages in it. And it starts at the alone stage and it comes full circle to end again, at the alone stage. After the alone stage we have the getting together stage, the compatibility stage, the maintenance stage, and then back to the alone stage. I’d like to focus on the – both ends of the alone stage. And the maintenance stage, mainly because those are the times when you’re going to have the majority of clients coming in for counseling. In the alone stage, it’s a time when clients are trying to figure out how to change being lonely, feeling lonely into simply the neutral position of being alone. The treatment goals of the alone stage are to help your client’s resolve pass grief. We’ll talk about that at the end of the maintenance stage. And to develop clarity. And there’s clarity in four areas that you want to focus on. The first area is the role that your client played in the breakup. Now I’m not trying to blame my clients for anything that happened. But I also don’t want them to become victims either. I think that when we label the other person as the person who’s fault it was, then they become the villain. And the client becomes the victim and that’s not a very empowered place from which to work. The second thing is what do your clients bring to a relationship. So what are the positive values, characteristics and traits that they have, that they’re going to bring and share in a relationship. And what are some – what’s some of the baggage that they’re going to bring into that relationship. Get clear about those things. And you want to help your clients develop clarity about what they actually want in a partner. So that they’re not just randomly going out in search of the first person who shows interests in them. They need to decide what are the things that they’re looking for. And then the hardest part of all is to ask your client to take that long hard look in the mirror and say, am I the person that my ideal partner would be attracted to. If the answer is yes, great, they’re ready to go out and start into the – getting together phase. But if the answer is no, then they’ve got some work to do. They either want to change what they’re looking for in a partner. Or they want to grow themselves into the person that would attract that particular person into their lives. So as they leave the – the alone stage, and move into the getting together stage, what clients are looking at is really where do they find people. How do they find people to date, how do they get connected. And they’re also figuring out is this a person that I want to get to know better. Or should I just cut my losses and move forward. So the therapeutic treatment goals during this stage would be helping your clients move from that desperate needing to have someone in their lives, to simply wanting to have someone with which to share their life. And help them become open to meeting new people. Some clients enter this getting together stage with the fear of other people. And others go into it with just a reckless abandon. And they’re just going to, you know, try to see what happens. You want to find – help them find that balance. They move from the getting together phase into the compatibility phase. Which is where they’ve been with someone for awhile. And now they’re trying to decide do we have enough in common, uh, to move forward to, uh – a bigger commitment. Are we compatible enough for the long haul. So the treatment goals of the compatibility stage are to help your clients – again, it’s about clarity. Figuring out what they’re non-negotiables or their deal breakers are. You want clients to be clear on that so that they don’t compromise those things. And settle for a person who is less than what they’re looking for. There shouldn’t be a lot of deal breakers. Maybe three to five deal breakers is a—is a good amount. If you’ve got a list of 20, you maybe somebody who’s afraid of recommitting in a relationship. And if you don’t have any you may be somebody who really isn’t clear about what’s important to you. You also want to help clients define their areas of flexibility and where they’re willing to bargain and negotiate with certain things. Also during the computability stage you might be helping clients decide whether to commit to a relationship or whether to move on. If they’ve committed, they’ll move into the maintenance stage. And the maintenance stage is where a lot of people come into counseling because they’re trying to maintain happiness or find their happiness again. They’ve been in this long term committed relationship and they’re thinking is this all there is. So there’s a lot of things I could talk about as far as the maintenance stage goes. But I really want to talk about three specific things. The first one, is helping your clients learn to engage the platinum rule. This is a rule that was developed by Tony Alice Sandra in the business world. And it – it’s different from the old golden rule. The platinum rule says, do unto others as they would have you do unto them. Very different from the golden rule. If we go around using the golden rule and do unto everyone the way we want them to do unto us, we’re probably giving people – we’re treating people in a way that they may not want to be treated. Because none of us want to be treated the same all the time. This was very clear in the book that Gary Chapman wrote called the Five Love Languages. Which happens to be a book that probably saved more relationships in my practice than any other book including my own. And in the Five Love Languages, Gary talks about how everybody has a different way that they – they need to feel loved. And so, if you’re speaking in your own love language and that happens to be different from your partner’s, then they’re not going to understand that you love them. So the platinum rule is about treating other people the way they want to be treated, not the way you would want to be treated in a similar situation. I also like to talk about problem ownership with my clients. This is an important point, because a lot of times, people have something that’s frustrating to them in their partner. And they want to make their partner responsible for the solution. So I’m going to use just simple little, non serious problems that I hear a lot in counseling. It’s stereotypical, I know, but I hear a lot of women talking about how their partner never gets their dirty clothes in the hamper. They always leave the clothes on the floor. Somewhere other than in the hamper. And this is a problem for them. I hear from the men to give equal time, that they have a problem, when they get into their partner’s car, and they see the little red light on the dashboard, that says, low gas. So when I tell – when I let couples talk about these problems, and I ask them, well whose problem is that. The wife will look at the husband and say, well it’s his problem he doesn’t pick up his clothes. And the husband will look at the wife and say, well it’s her problem that she doesn’t fill the car up with gas. And then I talk about how I define a problem. And I define a problem, the person who owns it, is the person who’s most upset by it. So it the husband’s problem that the clothes are the floor, no, he’s not even thinking about those clothes. He’s off to work doing what he needs to do for his day. It’s the wife’s problem that the clothes are on the floor. And vice versa. Is it the wife’s problem that the car is on low gas, no. She’s thinking, I got 200 miles to go with that red light on it’s no problem. And the husband is the one who’s frustrated and having difficulty because the – the low gas light is on. So once you recognize whose problem it is, then the person whose problem it is, the person who owns that problem now becomes responsible for the solution. So, I always say the first step is to ask for what you want. It’s certainly okay to ask your partner hunny, I’d really like it if you’d pick you’d clothes up off the floor and put them in the hamper. And the husband can say, darling, I really worry about you when you’re driving around out there with no gas. I really wish you would fill up at quarter of a tank. If the other person responds to the request and starts doing what you want them to do, then you have success. Problem solved. Great. The problem is most time people are doing what works for them. Those clothes on the floor work. The low gas works. So they’re not likely to make that change just because you asked them. It’s not that they’re doing it to frustrate you or to annoy you. It’s just that what they’re going is need satisfying for them. So now it’s your job to change it. So, I tell women, if they’re frustrated about the clothes on the floor, put them in the hamper. How long will it take. Or you could change your perception and decide you’re not going to let that bother you. Or, you could make a rule in the family and say, I’m going to wash the clothes get that in the hamper. If clothes don’t make it to the hamper you’re going to have to wash your own. That may solve the problem. And men, I say, if you’re frustrated about your wife’s low gas, go fill the car up with gas. It’s not going to hurt you. Or decide that it’s not going to bother you. Or you may want to make a rule that says, if you run out of gas out on the highway you’re going to have to call triple A, I’m not coming to get you. The next thing I want to talk about is appreciation of difference. This is a high bar for couples. And usually they come in conflict over something. So the first position which I think about climbing a ladder, the first rung on the ladder is conflict. And I’m going to use the situation, a conflict over finances. Because that’s often something that I hear about. One person in the couple is a spender. The other person is a saver. And they come in, and they’re just bickering all the time over money. So that’s the first position conflict. I like to ask couples if they’re willing to step one rung up on the ladder to, um, toleration or tolerance. I want you to tolerate this in the other person. Now what that means is, you may still be mad and frustrated about it. But you’re not going to say anything about it. You’re going to climb the ladder to this place, you’re going to keep your mouth shut. And you’re just going to kind of white knuckle it through those situations. So, tolerance is not a place where I ever want people to stop. Because who wants to be tolerated. It doesn’t even sound like a good word. But it’s better than conflict. So we’re going to climb that first rung to tolerance. And when you both get to tolerance, then I’m going to ask you if you can climb one more step to acceptance. Now when I think about acceptance I think about giving up the anger, the frustration, and the resentment. When you get to acceptance it feels peaceful. It’s like that serenity prayer that we hear about. And I like to just tweak that serenity prayer just a little bit and I say it like this. And I teach this to my clients. God grant me the serenity to accept the people I cannot change. And I ask who is that. Well, it’s everybody. Courage to change the one I can. And the wisdom to know that person is me. So when you get to acceptance you’ve stopped trying to change the other person. And you’ve started to look at how can I change myself so that I can accept this in my partner. Usually it’s not the biggest piece of my partner. I’ve made it a big piece by focusing on it. And frustrating about it all these years. But – when I get to acceptance I’m going to put it in its proper perspective. And I’m going to realize why I love this person. For all those many other reasons. And allow this to just be a small piece of that person. And this could be the end. But I like to climb one more rung on the ladder to what I call appreciating differences. And this means that that thing that you were in conflict over, earlier, the spending, when you get to appreciating differences, each person is looking at how the other person provides them with a lesson, a gift or an opportunity for themselves in that situation. So for the spender, your lesson, gift or opportunity provided by your partner, is to learn how to be concerned and thoughtful about the future. And for the saver, your opportunity lesson or gift from your partner is to learn to be spontaneous and carefree sometimes. And then, by death, divorce or personal decision, people leave that maintenance stage and go back into the alone stage again. And during this time, there’s a -- a strong need to work through the grief and loss of that relationship. The goals of the grief and loss phase are again, trying to identify the lesson, gifts and opportunities in the loss. This is something that usually happens years down the road as you look back you can see. But I try to help my clients find it in the moment. Now I can share my own personal story about this. When my husband was diagnosed with leukemia. And he ended up dying when he was 37 years old in 1999. During that time I struggled with what could possibly be good about this situation. It also didn’t even seem right to be trying to find something good in the situation. But I knew I had to do that for my two children. So the first thing that I realized was that, we were going to have the opportunity to say good bye. A lot of people don’t get that. And that is a gift. So that was one thing. The second thing I found in the moment was that my husband was a workaholic. And he worked as a mechanic, often leaving the house at seven in the morning, not coming home till eight or nine at night. And hardly spend any time with us at all. When he got his diagnosis, and he realized that the chemical benzene was somehow linked to his type of leukemia he stopped working. Even before he was too sick to work. And during that time he spent a lot of time with our children and with myself. He was the coach of the little league team. He was the coach of their soccer team. He taught them to hunt. He taught them how to work on cars. And he took all us on a wonderful trip to Disney World. None of that would have happened had he lived to be 100 and healthy. So that was another gift that we had. And there were many other lessons and opportunities that we – we found along the way. So with my clients I know they’re ready when they can get to embrace the quote by Dr. Seuss that I love. And it says, don’t cry because it’s open – I’m sorry, don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened. We want our clients to get to a place where they can be happy that they had their relationship that they had. But also not be frustrated that it didn’t last longer. Accept the gift of the relationship for as long as they have it. And move forward. I hope this has helped you with some ideas about counseling throughout the relationship cycle. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER -- cycle for couples. I have to say, um, counseling couples is one of my favorite things to do. Whether they’re married, unmarried, opposite sex, same sex. It’s one of my favorite types of clients to work with. And you must enjoy it too because you wrote a book on working with couples, didn’t you.

00:18:00
KIM OLVER I did. I wrote a book called Secrets of Happy Couples. And I was all ready to write the book based on what I thought was the secrets for happy couples. And then I thought, you know, maybe people would want some research to back up what I think. So – I know. It’s not my favorite thing. I can tell you. But I decided that I wanted to interview 100 happy couples. And I do a lot of speaking around the country. And I figured it – with all the people that I come in contact with I’ll ask would you take my survey. If you’re – my criteria were you had to be together at least 10 years. Because I say, everybody looks good in the beginning. And -- 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:18:40
KIM OLVER -- the second thing was, if I asked you separately without your partner there would you say that you’re happy in your relationship. And both people had to answer that yes. So then they – they qualified. And I thought it would take me six months. It took me two years. 

00:18:50
SHANNON DERMER Wow. 

00:18:55
KIM OLVER So during that time I kept saying to myself, this book has to get to written. Because there’s people out there, many, many people. And I’m not saying they’re living miserable lives. But they’re living mediocre lives in relationships that could be so much better if they just understood what they needed to do. To appreciate and – and stop trying to change each other. 

00:19:10
SHANNON DERMER That’s great. I had to say – um, and I want to learn more about that. I have to say, uh, years ago I volunteered for Hurricane Katrina to go through Red Cross and, um, there was a couple there, they were both retired. And they would volunteer for Red Cross and do all different kinds of things together. And they enjoyed being together. And they’d been married for like 35 years. And I was fascinated by them. And I asked them, if you had one piece of advice to give people who were newly married, you know, as – as these experts who had been married for 35 years. What would it be. And, um, the, uh, wife said, well always be polite. You know, we’re often polite to other people. And – and we take our spouses for granted. And, um, the husband said, uh – the husband said, um, just know that they’re always not going to agree. And she said, that’s a stupid one. I was like, well he had a point. 

00:20:10
KIM OLVER There you go. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER You’re not always going to agree. But it is fascinating because we often focus in on what doesn’t work for couples. So you focused in on what makes them happy, right. What -- 

00:20:20
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER -- was working. 

00:20:20
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER So what are some of the things that you found. 

00:20:25
Kim Olver 

00:20:25
KIM OLVER Well, it was interesting because one of the things I found they – that they said was monogamy. That was something – being able to trust and loyalty was important. Um, the other thing that I wasn’t expecting to find was they, uh, often credited something bigger than themselves that they were accountable to. Whether it was a spirituality, uh, a god or their own relationship that when they were making decisions they weren’t just deciding what’s best for me, it’s about what’s best for the relationship. Or what’s the right thing to do. And that was interesting to me because I wasn’t looking for that. 

00:21:00
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:21:00
KIM OLVER The thing that I was looking for I did find. And that was that they had stopped trying to change each other. They had accepted each other for who they were. And had begun to really appreciate their partner. And then of course, the one that always makes the list is effective communication. And I always put effective there because I know couples who have lots of communication, but they’re not very happy. So effective communication is – is the other thing that I found. Those four things. 

00:21:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:21:25
SHANNON DERMER Those are great ones. I know I always tell, um, my supervisees when they come in and they – I ask them what is the presenting problem of the couple. And they say, oh, well the couple says, they’re not communicating. I’m like, do not tell me they’re not communicating. 

00:21:40
KIM OLVER Oh, of course they are. 

00:21:40
SHANNON DERMER I go whether you’re yelling, giving each other – other the silent treatment, you’re – you’re communicating. It’s not effective communicating. 

00:21:45
KIM OLVER Correct. 

00:21:45
SHANNON DERMER Or it’s not the type of communication that is enhancing their relationship. But, uh, I think it was Gregory Bates and he said, we cannot not communicate. 

00:21:55
KIM OLVER That’s right. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER So effective communication. What do you consider effective communication? 

00:22:00
KIM OLVER Well, I think it’s communication that really seeks to understand the other person. So, you know, I talk about listening. But when I talk about listening I talk about not just waiting for the other person to stop talking so you can jump in and say your peace. 

00:22:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:15
KIM OLVER It’s about really working hard to understand the position of the other person. Through their eyes and their skin in their shoes as best you can, of course, because you’re not that other person. There’s never perfect understanding. But as best you can, not so that you’ll agree with them. The goal isn’t agreement. But the goal is understanding. And once – once you have that understanding the motivation changes. The other piece that I like to say is, don’t take it personally. And so many couples when – when things aren’t going well, they think it’s an affront to them personally. He’s just doing this to get me made. 

00:22:50
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:22:50
KIM OLVER That’s usually not the reason. So if they can stop taking it personally, take that objective approach and then really try to understand where the other person’s coming from, I think magical things can happen. 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER Wow. So – and that is an important difference isn’t it between agreement and understanding. So the goal -- 

00:23:10
KIM OLVER Huge. 

00:23:10
SHANNON DERMER -- is not agreement, it’s appreciation of differences. 

00:23:10
KIM OLVER Correct. 

00:23:10
SHANNON DERMER I think you said. And it’s, um, understanding. And what kind of magic do you see happen with couples when they move to that point of understanding, not taking it personally. 

00:23:20
KIM OLVER Well, a lot – I see couples at opposite ends, right. This person’s here, this person’s there. Now you talk. You really understand where the other person’s coming from. You’re not taking it personally so you don’t have that need to be defensive any more. So now you’re able to move closer to each other to a position where you both can – it’s not agreeing, but it’s a negotiation. It’s getting to a place – and I don’t even like to use the word compromise because I feel like compromise implies we’re giving something up. This is a negotiation where I feel like I win. My partner feels like he wins. And our relationship wins because we’ve gone through this respectful process of understanding each other so we can come out on the other side stronger. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Very good. Now, uh, I don’t know – are you familiar with John Gotman? 

00:24:10
KIM OLVER A little bit. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER Now one of the things he talks about is, um, defensive – defensiveness being something that really damages, uh, relationships. And you mentioned that. So, you said people start out here and here. And, uh, through understanding and acceptance of differences that’s the magic that kind of moves them closer together. How does defensiveness maybe get in the way of some of that. 

00:24:30
Kim Olver 

00:24:30
KIM OLVER Well, defensiveness gets in the way because when I’m not understanding where you’re really coming from, I – I think it’s about me. and I’m taking it personally. And so now I’m defensive. And I can’t hear you. And I can’t work towards a solution because I’m too busy protecting myself. And – and that happens so often. As silly aside, I wrote an article for, um Your Tango, which is a relationship magazine – or, online relationship site. And they asked one of us to write about, um, what is that Christian Gray, um -- 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER Oh. Uh, no. Yeah. 

00:25:05
KIM OLVER I can’t think of the name of the book. But anyway - 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:05
KIM OLVER -- I wrote about it. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER Men are from Mars and Women are from -- 

00:25:10
KIM OLVER Kind of -- 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER Something like that. 

00:25:10
KIM OLVER Well, no. No, no. 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER Oh. 

00:25:10
KIM OLVER That – no. This -- 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER Oh, Christian Gray. The Fifty Shades of Gray. 

00:25:10
KIM OLVER  Fifty Shades of Gray. 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER Sorry, yes. 

00:25:15
KIM OLVER Right. That’s it, right. 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER So that’s a whole different thing. 

00:25:15
KIM OLVER Whole different thing. That’s right. 

00:25:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:15
KIM OLVER And I wrote about what men could learn from Fifty Shades of Gray. And I wrote about what women didn’t learn from Fifty Shades of Gray. 

00:25:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh interesting. 

00:25:25
KIM OLVER And – and the comments that I got on those two articles were from men who are so angry at women and women who are so angry at men and who are misperceiving the motivation behind the behaviors. And as long as people are in attack mode, and not willing to really listen and hear where the other person is coming from I’m going to be employed forever. I’m going to have lots of work to do. And so will you. So it’s – that’s what defensiveness does. It – it – we don’t even hear the other person because we have our mind made up about what you’re really saying. And what you really mean. And we tell ourselves these stories. And these stories we tell ourselves separate us from each other instead of bringing us together. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Now, um, you explained that very well. Thank you. 

00:26:15
KIM OLVER Oh, thanks. 

00:26:15
SHANNON DERMER Uh, we only have a couple of minutes left. But I think an area – like you mentioned money. But I think an area that is so difficult to have effective communication and people do take it personally and they have a hard time accepting differences is sex. Since you mentioned Fifty Shades of Gray. 

00:26:30
KIM OLVER Yes. 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER Um, what piece of advice might you give to couples around how to lower their reactiveness around, uh, discussions about sex. 

00:26:40
KIM OLVER Well, one of the things – and I have a whole chapter devoted to this in my book. And I call it the dance of – uh, the dance of romance and sex. Because they’re two different things. But they’re interconnected. And usually one person in the partner wants romance over sex. And the other person wants sex over romance. So I take it back to that platinum rule. And I say if you want more romance in your relationship, you need to be more sexual. If you want more sex in your relationship, you need to be romantic. And you need to be willing to take that responsibility for what you want by being the one to take the first step. Instead of sitting back and waiting for the other person to do it. If you’re looking for something, give you partner what your partner wants most. And you’ll be surprised. And – and will get what you’re looking for in return many times. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER That’s a great point. I think a lot of times people see it as giving in. 

00:27:35
KIM OLVER Um-hmm. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER Rather than doing what’s best for you and your relationship that a lot of times if you make your partner happier, then he or she will also make you happier. And that it’s this, uh, we call it sometimes positive, um, feedback. That it actually escalates in a good way. 

00:27:50
KIM OLVER Yes. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER Instead of a bad way. 

00:27:50
KIM OLVER Absolutely. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER I’m happier. I make you happier. You’re happier you make me happier. Instead of it escalating in a bad way. 

00:28:00
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER Oh, very good. Well, um, we only have a few seconds left here. But if there’s, um – just quickly, one piece of advice, like, I ask my couple, that you could give couples on how to have a happy, long term relationship, what would it be? 

00:28:15
KIM OLVER I think it would – it would go to, um, treating each other with – with respect, with honor, with appreciation for even the small things that each person does. I think that goes a long way. 

00:28:30
SHANNON DERMER Similar to, uh, the wife’s thing, I believe it was about politeness. Showing respect, not taking your partner for granted. 

00:28:35
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER The little things as well as the big things. 

00:28:40
KIM OLVER Absolutely. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. I want to thank you, Kim Olver for you --
