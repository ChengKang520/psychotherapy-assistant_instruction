Biofeedback for Counselors: Empowering Clients for Sustained Positive Lifestyle Change Jane E. Myers, Ph.D., LPC, NCC Board Certified in Neurofeedback 

00:00:00
[music] 

00:00:05
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Hello, and welcome to Biofeedback for Counselors. Biofeedback is a wellness oriented approach that contributes in a powerful way to sustained positive lifestyle change. It is a tool counselors can use to help clients feel a sense of control when their lives may feel out of control. Easy, affordable and can be a part of any counselors practice, , agencies, universities, and more. Biofeedback also can help counselors cope with the stresses and challenges of our demanding jobs. Once you know more about biofeedback, the question, you may ask is this. Why have I waited to make this a part of my life and my work? 

00:00:40
Overview ~ * Definition: what is biofeedback? * Why biofeedback: the stress-illness connection * Benefits of biofeedback * Biofeedback in counseling * Imagery and Breathing * Affordable equipment for biofeedback * Training, certification, and resources 

00:00:45
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC In this program will start by defining biofeedback and discussing why this tool is important for counselors. Understanding the stress-illness connection provide a basis for understanding the benefits of biofeedback. How counselors can use biofeedback will be discussed. And a variety of easily accessible, sometimes free resources for incorporating biofeedback in your work will be described, and their use, demonstrated. We'll briefly mention resources and references so you can learn more and start using biofeedback with yourself and your clients today.

00:01:20
Definition ~ What is biofeedback? 

00:01:20
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC So, what exactly is biofeedback? many counselors think that biofeedback does complicated, expensive and difficult to use. While, there is much theory and research underlying biofeedback and research labs do require expensive equipment. From a practical perspective, all counselors can find easy and inexpensive or even free ways to integrate biofeedback with our clients. 

00:01:45
Definition of Biofeedback * "a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance" (aapb.org) * Active, intentional control of physiological processes 

00:01:45
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC biofeedback has been defined by the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, as "a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance". Rather than being victims of what's happening in our bodies. Biofeedback allows us to have active, intentional control of physiological processes once thought to be out of voluntary control. 

00:02:15

00:02:15
Why Biofeedback ~ The stress-illness connection 

00:02:15
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC As a consequence biofeedback is an important way to take control of our lives, our health and our over all wellness. Biofeedback is increasingly important because of the strong association between stress and illness. 

00:02:30
The Stress-Illness Connection ~ TIME STRESS! Seeking Cures for Modern Anxieties � 1983 Time Magazine: "leading health problem" � 1996 Prevention Magazine: 75% feel "great stress one day/week" �2010 Psychology Today: "stress is endemic..." 

00:02:30
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Stress is a pervasive and inescapable fact of life today. In 1983, Time Magazine reported that stress was a "leading health problem,". And the American Institute of Stress has emphasized that things have not gotten better for most of us. Prevention Magazine in 1996 reported that three out of four Americans feel great stress at least one day per week. And in 2010, Psychology Today reported that "stress is endemic in our society. Indeed, it is endemic globally". 

00:03:00
Stress and Health ~ * 75 - 90% of doctor visits are stress-related ! * Consequences of stress: � Cardiovascular diseases - High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke � Gastrointestinal distress - Ulcers � Obesity -Diabetes * Musculoskeletal Pain - Back and neck pain LIFESTYLE 

00:03:05
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC It has been estimated that between 75 and 90% of all visits to physicians are stress related. The consequences, affect everybody's system, contributing to chronic diseases and disabilities that have a negative and lasting effect on our quality of life. The good news is that stress-related illnesses are directly related to lifestyle factors. Although stress can create and exacerbate virtually any symptom lifestyle factors can be modified. Biofeedback is one of the most important means available to modify our lifestyles to create greater wellness. It is something that anyone can do virtually any time. It is easy to learn and easy to practice, and it only works well if we take time to practice. 

00:03:45
Benefits of biofeedback ~ Biofeedback In Counseling 

00:03:45
Benefits of Biofeedback ~ * Better, more effective stress management * Reduction of physical symptoms * Greater health and wellness * Pain management * Enhanced sense of control 

00:03:50
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Among the many benefits of biofeedback, these standout for individuals: Better, more effective management of stress, reduction of physical symptoms, greater health and wellness, pain management, and an enhanced sense of control. Biofeedback modalities are increasingly accepted as billable by insurance companies. Based on research demonstrating that such interventions contribute to reductions in medical costs. So, how can counselors get started? The first and most important strategy for all biofeedback approaches is breathing and the second is imagery. 

00:04:30
BREATHING ~ Imagery & Breathing 

00:04:35
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC The key to successful breeding is twofold awareness of breath and slowing of breathing. Watch your client can count the number of breaths they take per minute. The ideal is six or less, many clients take 15 to 20 or more shallow breath each minute. Proper breathing contributes to greater physical health, is the singular most effective means for stress management and is easy to learn and practice, it is also free. 

00:05:00
Breathing ~ * Slow, intentional breaths * 6 breaths per minute * Belly or diaphragmatic breathing * Longer on the out-breath Take a moment... Practice breathing slowly, through your diaphragm... 

00:05:05
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Healthy breathing begins by taking slow intentional press trying to breathe in and out six times per minute, counting slowly to six on the in-breath and six on the out-breath is helpful. Importantly, use belly or diaphragmatic breathing, feeling your stomach expand as you breathe deeply into the very bottom of your lungs breathe out slowly pursing your lips so you breathe slightly longer on the out-breath, take a moment to practice. 

00:05:35
[music] 

00:06:00
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC All counselors are taught to use imagery to help clients cope with stress and to create positive change. Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery exercises are important adjuncts to biofeedback. You may want to use available commercial CDs or create your own narratives individualized to client needs to promote relaxation while having your clients focus on belly breathing at the rate of six breaths per minute. 

00:06:25
Integrating Biofeedback in Counseling ~ Affordable Equipment for Biofeedback 

00:06:30
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Now, that you know the basics of biofeedback. Let's look at a few of the readily available devices to help you integrate biofeedback into your counseling practice. Breathing is most important, so a device that teaches the basics of breathing could be useful. 

00:06:45
RESPeRATE * Non-drug therapy for "adjunctive treatment for high blood pressure ...reduction of stress." * Teaches clients to breathe slowly * $299.95 * www.resperate.com 

00:06:45
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC RESPeRATE is a small device with headsets and a built-in audio program advertised as a nondrug therapy for adjunctive treatment of high blood pressure and reduction, stress. It teaches clients to breathe slowly, records breathing rates and provides feedback to reinforce changes in breathing patterns. The cost is about $300. Let's look at a client using RESPeRATE. 

00:07:10
[music] 

00:07:10
Example ~ As the client listens to the instructions and begins to breathe slowly and deeply ~ the client relaxes ~ stress decreases ~ blood pressure decreases 

00:08:15
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC The more stress we experience, the lower the temperature in our hands and feet. He fight or flight response, which activates when we are stressed since blood to our internal organs and away from our extremities. If we can cause our hands to warm through intentional generation of positive thoughts and feelings, our extremities will warm and our stress will decrease. Biofeedback, in this instance is accomplished through attaching an inexpensive temperature probe to the middle finger of one hand I'm watching a temperature gauge, while imagining oneself at a beach with our hands in the warm sand on a calm, sunny afternoon. 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:08:50
Example ~ Client learning to use visualization to increase finger temperature and decrease stress 

00:08:55
MARK All right. 

00:08:55
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC OK, Mark, when you came in today you said you were feeling pretty stressed. 

00:08:55
MARK Yeah. Pretty stressed. 

00:09:00
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Got a lot going on? 

00:09:00
MARK Yeah, yeah. Definitely. 

00:09:00
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC And I asked whether your hands were warm or cold, and you said they felt a little colder than usual. 

00:09:05
MARK Yeah, a little bit. 

00:09:05
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC And when we, uh, put the finger sensor on there and checked your temperature, it was a little below normal. 

00:09:10
MARK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC So, what we'd like to try to do is see if we can raise the temperature in your fingers, because we know that when you're stressed, the blood, leaves your extremities. And you know you have this internal stress response that we can change that if we can warm up your extremities, then it alleviates the stress. 

00:09:25
MARK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:30
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC So, what I'd like you to do is hold this sensor and I'm gonna have you try to visualize, um, being someplace where your hands are warm. It could be running them under a faucet with hot water, or maybe something more fun would be to imagine yourself at the beach on a nice sunny afternoon. You might sit back and take a deep breath and, uh, just imagine yourself, it's about 90� outside. And you're sitting on some warm sand and your hands are in the sand, maybe you just kind of run your hands through the sand. Just imagine feeling the sun and hearing the ocean. Just put yourself there for a little while. 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:25
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC See how your temperature is coming along here? 

00:10:30
MARK Yeah, definitely. 

00:10:30
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Even just that little bit. You can begin to start to change and have control over your, your stress response. 

00:10:35
MARK I definitely feel a lot more relaxed here. Just a little. 

00:10:40
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Just that little. 

00:10:40
MARK Bit of time thinking about being at the beach. 

00:10:40
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC And taking one deep breath. 

00:10:45
MARK Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:10:45
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Well, if you do it longer, you could probably raise your finger temperature by 10, even more degrees. 

00:10:50
MARK Wow. That big of a difference in that little amount of time. 

00:10:55
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC It might take you five or 10 minutes, but during that time, you'd be very, very relaxed. 

00:11:00
MARK Cool. Yeah, that's pretty neat. 

00:11:05
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Music is an important adjunct to biofeedback and not just any music will do. Listening to Baroque music, which includes pulses at 50 to 80 beats per minute, has been associated with increased creativity, increase learning, lower blood pressure, increased alpha brain wave activity, decreased stress and a host of other positive benefits. By pairing specific pieces of music repeatedly with biofeedback practice we can use classical conditioning to create a relaxation response whenever that piece of music is heard. 

00:11:35
Music ~ Baroque Music * Pachebel -Canon in D * Albinoni -Adagio in G * Vivaldi -Violin Concerto in F Minor * Handel -Water Music * Bach -Organ Works 

00:11:40
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC A few pieces of Baroque music are listed here. Composers such as Pachelbel, Vivaldi and Bach produced famous pieces of Baroque music. Common instruments used to create these soothing sounds were the violin, guitar, harpsichord and other stringed instruments. All can be combined with any forms of biofeedback to increase the relaxation response. For example, I always use the same piece of music with heart rate variability practice as a consequence, the music alone is enough to create the relaxation response. 

00:12:10
Heart Rate Variability * Use breathing to slow heart rate * Increase Heart Rate Variability (HRV) � Increase relaxation * Key indicator of health � Parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system balance 

00:12:10
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Heart rate variability is a key indicator of positive health. It refers to the beat variation of the heart rhythm. You can use breathing exercises to slow your heart rate and increase your heart rate variability. Though this increases your sense of relaxation. The internal benefits extend beyond the relaxation response. HRV is a key indicator of health and balance between our parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. 

00:12:35
Heart Rate Variability * Entrainment * Process in which heart, brain, organs, hormones, parasympathetic, sympathetic nervous system align in synchrony and harmony * Facilitated by HRV training 

00:12:35
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC Practicing HRV training results in an important process called entrainment. In the entrainment process, our heart, brain, organs, hormones, parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system align in a state of synchrony and harmony. This not only produces greater health and wellness. It feels great, too.

WILD DIVINE "relaxing Rhythms" WILD DIVINE "JOURNEY to the WILD DIVINE" relax, relieve restore 

00:12:55
HeartMath "emwave pc stress relief system" 

00:12:55
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC The entrainment process is facilitated by HRV training. Heart rate variability training is best accomplished and practiced at least initially with computer-assisted biofeedback devices. The two most commonly used are "Journey to the Wild Divine" and "HeartMath". HeartMath is slightly less expensive and can be purchased for around $250. The Wild Divine system start at $300. Though quite different, the goal of these systems is the same, to increase heart rate variability through breathing, imagery and feedback. 

00:13:30
Journey to the Wild Divine * Narrators � Deepak Chopra � Andrew Weil � Dean Ornish * Training � Breathing � Relaxation � Meditation � Stress Management � www.wilddivine.com 

00:13:30
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC The Journey to the Wild Divine software programs combine technology with beautiful visuals, soothing sounds and effective meditation and breathing techniques to help you transform the rhythms of your thoughts, emotions and states of mind. Narrator, such as Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, and Dean Ornish provide training in various techniques for breathing, relaxation and meditation to promote effective stress management. The following video clip shows a client using the Wild Divine system to learn relaxation strategies. Note the heart rate variability graph, which provides real-time feedback on the success of imagery activities. 

00:14:15

00:14:30
HeartMath ~ * Coherence Coach � teaches breathing � teaches coherence * EmWave Software � Records HRV � Assesses coherence � Provides constant feedback, small � Visual small � Auditory � Includes several games 

00:15:00
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC HeartMath is another computer-assisted biofeedback system that includes a few games and visuals to help people learn to increase their heart rate variability. It differs from Wild Divine products in several ways. Notably, an emphasis on heart focused breathing, the intentional generation of positive heart-based emotions and its goal of teaching clients to replace chronic negative emotional states with chronic positive emotional states. HeartMath software includes a Coherence Coach, which includes a moving around to teach breathing, which is adjustable to various breathing rates. The Coherence Coach also talks you through the process of learning to generate both heart-based breathing and heart-based emotions. It is these emotions that create entrainment. Entrainment and synchrony of body systems, occurs when we are in a state of high coherence. Shown by the green bar on the HeartMath screen. A blue bar indicates medium coherence and a red bar indicates low or no coherence. HeartMath is easily taught and most people learn to be in high coherence with minimal practice time. Once we recognize the feeling of high coherence. It is hard not to want to feel that way more. The following two video clip show clients using the basic HeartMath program, the second clip shows a client playing one of the HeartMath games to practice heart-based coherence training.

00:16:50
Learning More ~ Training, Certification & Resources 

00:17:25
JANE E. MYERS, PH.D., LPC HeartMath provides training programs for users and specialized training and certification for healthcare providers. The HeartMath web site includes numerous research reports demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach to reducing test anxiety and increasing student test performance. As well as reducing symptoms of major stress related illnesses. Certification in biofeedback is available from the Association of Applied Physiology and Biofeedback or BCIA.org. This website also includes links to research articles supporting the use of biofeedback for stress management and treatment of stress-related illnesses; such as high blood pressure, migraine headaches, and TMJ. Certification is not necessary for any of the strategies discussed in this program, but it's something that those of you who want a [00;18:15]deeper level of training may find attractive. I encourage you to begin integrating biofeedback into your personal wellness practices. It does not take long to begin to experience the positive benefits of doing so. Once you know it works you will want to teach your clients a simple biofeedback techniques and increasingly integrate biofeedback as a tool in your practice. Having clients practice relaxation for a few minutes at the start of a session can promote greater awareness and self understanding, and more productive counseling sessions as well. Of course, we teach best that which we know and practice. As professionals, our own biofeedback practice will quickly demonstrate the personal benefits of being in contact with and in control of our physical and emotional responses to stress. Using simple biofeedback strategies before or even during counseling sessions will help us remain present to our clients, focused on their concerns and role models for them to follow. What better motivation to integrate biofeedback into your counseling practice, as well as into your daily life.
