BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hello. My name is Mike Simmons and I teach counseling at the University of Wales, New Port. We make quite a lot of videos and DVDs here and two of our most successful titles have been an introduction to CBT and CBT skills in practice. Both of these were made by a colleague of mine Frank Wills and Frank is back in the studio again today to make the third title in this series. So Frank what are we going to be looking at today? 

00:00:30
FRANK WILLS Well today we are going to be focusing on CBT for depression and the… the clients that I am working with will show some of the classic symptoms of depression which are roughly along the lines of um… sad, unhappy depressed emotions and feelings um… negative thoughts about herself and her life. Um, a sense of um… withdrawing a bit from the life and not being so active and may well also show things like disturbed sleep and other physiological patterns such as um… suppressed appetite. 

00:01:15
MIKE SIMMONS You refer to the client, but maybe it’s worth as pointing out that the Rozar(ph) is in fact to colleague and she is role playing and here it’s not the real session. 

00:01:25
FRANK WILLS That’s right. Um, but I think she is also drawing on… on some of her own experiences, both as a yeah… as a person and as a therapist herself. Um, it does have a very authentic feel to the session and although it was kind of lightly scripted there is a quite a lot of things came up that I had no idea it were going to come up and that gives it the feel of a live session very strongly I think. 

00:01:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. I think so. Now we are going to be looking a… a… series of clips. Ah, what's going to be happening in the first one we are going to look at? 

00:02:05
FRANK WILLS The… the first one will focus on setting an agenda which is how you nearly you wish trying to start um… a CBT session. CBT is a… is a structured therapy and this is important because it’s also usually a time limited therapy as well. 

00:02:20
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:25
FRANK WILLS I mean, there are circumstances where you can extend the time and do longer term therapy. But we begin with the idea of keeping things relatively brief and parsimonious. Parsimonious being trying to get the maximum results from the minimum efforts. Um, so having an agenda on a clear discussion is… is important and the couple of things I think that would be useful to for people to think about is that watching this. Firstly is um… agenda setting is… is probably part of the general attempt to be collaborative with the client. So you’re consulting about what you are going to be um… talking about and in… in this clip I was quite often actually… especially early in… in therapy that the clients isn’t always very clear what I want to talk about. So, probably more of the oneness is on the therapist suggesting things at this stage. But it’s still important that the attempt is made to… to have a… 

00:03:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:03:20
FRANK WILLS …a collaborative element to it. And also when we do um… put items on the agenda in general I try to relate those items to the overall um… therapeutic aims. So for example, a client might come in and they might have just had a difficult um… meeting with someone and that might be what they want to tell you about and that could well be an agenda items but it’s also important to frame it as, well that seems to be the type of situation often gets you upset. So, working or handling that… 

00:04:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:04:00
FRANK WILLS …blues will empower or… 

00:04:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:04:00
FRANK WILLS …or aims of the therapy over all. 

00:04:05
MIKE SIMMONS So shall we look at the first clip? 

00:04:05
FRANK WILLS Lets do that. 

00:04:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:04:05
FRANK WILLS And looking through your um… activity schedule. It look like you know um… the week before last you had a pretty good week you know. And you did some nice things. I think you saw your sister… 

00:04:20
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:04:20
FRANK WILLS But this last week you know, you’ve had a bit of a… a down turn in mood and that seem to come about when you… when you had some kind of incident with your son Ashley? 

00:04:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS Would that be right? 

00:04:35
ROZAR (ph) Yes. 

00:04:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. So any ways that… that’s how I read what you said. 

00:04:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…. 

00:04:40
FRANK WILLS Here about the last fortnight. But just… just briefly tell me how… how… how you’ve experienced it? 

00:04:45
ROZAR (ph) Well it’s a bit of a mix really… 

00:04:50
FRANK WILLS Right… right… 

00:04:50
ROZAR (ph) The first week was um… really, really good… 

00:04:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:04:55
ROZAR (ph) Hmmm, I made arrangements to um… meet up with my younger sister who I’m very close to and so we… we met up um… in Bristol… 

00:05:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:05:05
ROZAR (ph) And um… basically it was like we were single girls again and… 

00:05:15
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:05:15
ROZAR (ph) …and um teenagers really and just sort of chatting away and eating and… and just um… just fun… 

00:05:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:05:25
ROZAR (ph) Actually. 

00:05:25
FRANK WILLS Okay that’s greatest because that’s just what we were looking for… 

00:05:30
ROZAR (ph) Hmmm… 

00:05:30
FRANK WILLS …one that you were bit more active but also you know you did something that you would enjoy… 

00:05:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:05:35
FRANK WILLS …and get some pleasure from. 

00:05:35
ROZAR (ph) I did. 

00:05:35
FRANK WILLS Okay and so I’d like to go into that a bit more. We will put that on the agenda for dis… 

00:05:40
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:05:40
FRANK WILLS …discussion like that’s really important. But what about this… this second week? 

00:05:45
ROZAR (ph) Um… yeah that was um… more difficult really. I actually one of my son we just locked(ph) once really. 

00:05:55
FRANK WILLS Right… right… 

00:06:00
ROZAR (ph) and um… 

00:06:00
FRANK WILLS And you felt really upset… 

00:06:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… yeah… 

00:06:00
FRANK WILLS So that again is important that we… we analyze that… 

00:06:05
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:06:05
FRANK WILLS and… and really that would be seeing about um… you know whether is there any way you could handle situations like that without having this you know, getting very upset and having a down turn… 

00:06:20
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:06:20
FRANK WILLS So that would be our second agenda right. Would that… would that be okay? 

00:06:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:06:25
FRANK WILLS And is there anything else you think we should be talking about this week? 

00:06:30
ROZAR (ph) I don’t know really. 

00:06:30
FRANK WILLS Okay. Well that’s probably enough but with there might be a little bit… 

00:06:35
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:06:35
FRANK WILLS …extra chance of explore any of other issues that come up and… 

00:06:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:06:40
FRANK WILLS (inaudible ). 

00:06:42
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:06:42
MIKE SIMMONS So she did seem quite tentative about adding to the agenda herself. 

00:06:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I would agree with you that. I think that there is a distinct theme of tentativeness and there is a sense in which I have to um… decide how far I want to… to… to push her… 

00:07:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:07:00
FRANK WILLS …into certain activities and I… I’m… I think that’s partly what I was talking about before you know, this at the start of therapy um… the oneness usually is more with… with the therapist. But I think it is the more general thing and it comes up a bit later and I think it would be interesting to see you, if you were able to work with her later. 

00:07:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:07:20
FRANK WILLS And then relate it back to this discussion. 

00:07:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. And… and what… what's gonna happen now? What are we going to see next. 

00:07:30
FRANK WILLS The… they are two big things in the tape are behavioral activation which is a way of counteracting the behavioral withdrawal that’s often comes along with… with depression. And cognitive change, I tackling in the… the negative thinking that we were talking about earlier. And on this particular bit that we are going to watch now, it’s near the start of the behavioral activation sequence. And here I’m just trying to a sense of… of how Rozar(ph) is currently living out her life within the context of her… of her social… 

00:08:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:08:10
FRANK WILLS …life and environment and I’m using something called an activity schedule. This will be in the booklet which will accompany that the um… this… this DVD. And it’s like a chart that you keep where the client’s make entries about how they spend different parts of their day. And then they bring into therapy with them and first of all you will be looking back over what they’ve been doing or not doing in the previous week but later on in the therapy we do this a little bit later in… in this sequencing that we’d be looking forward to how they might start to change some of the patterns that became evident from looking back over their last week. So it can be used retrospectively and prospectively. 

00:09:00
MIKE SIMMONS So there is a real focus here on what she is actually doing. 

00:09:00
FRANK WILLS Yes and we… we are going for some detail. We are trying to see from hour to hour and what she is doing and we add in elements of how much she is do… enjoying or not enjoying what she is doing and how much activity level is… is… is actually in the… in the activity itself. For example, its… it’s a very different matter, say do some work in the garden to sitting passively in front of um… a television. And there is an interesting cover and debate about this because it has been part of cognitive behavior therapy more or less from the start. In fact its roots were probably in the behavior therapy which is slightly predated cognitive behavior therapy. And the emphasis initially was very much on upping activity levels but its.. there has been more recent thinking which encourages therapist to look more really adds the quality of the experience. And particularly the social and interpersonal engagement that’s it leads the client in to… for example, you can go for a run which is very active thing to do but um… you may not engage… 

00:10:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah…Yeah… 

00:10:20
FRANK WILLS …with people at all and in fact you might be running along having very negative… 

00:10:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… 

00:10:25
FRANK WILLS …thoughts about your lives. So there is more emphasis now on a reconnecting with social networks and… 

00:10:30
MIKE SIMMONS So its… it’s not just doing something. It’s the quality of doing the matter… 

00:10:35
FRANK WILLS It’s the quality, it’s the crucial. 

00:10:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Shall we look at the next clip? 

00:10:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah let’s do that… I mean, just… just looking at that first week… 

00:10:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… 

00:10:40
FRANK WILLS It looks like you know, you… because one of the things that’s happened is you know, as you’ve got a bit um… low in mood… 

00:10:50
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:10:50
FRANK WILLS You become less um… active in… in doing things. So this was really gonna miss quite a big effort… 

00:10:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:10:55
FRANK WILLS after going to Bristol wasn’t it? 

00:11:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:11:00
FRANK WILLS But this so… so tell me about… about what you did and… 

00:11:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah well it was um… it did take a… a big effort because I’ve been fighting really difficult to just motivate myself really to do anything. 

00:11:15
FRANK WILLS Hmmm…Hmmm… 

00:11:15
ROZAR (ph) So I you know, a lot of the time I’m indoors and um… because it feels safer in many ways… 

00:11:20
FRANK WILLS Oh it feel safer? 

00:11:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah and… in… in indoors but… 

00:11:25
FRANK WILLS Can you explain it little bit more… 

00:11:30
ROZAR (ph) Umm…. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS …about safer? 

00:11:30
ROZAR (ph) Well, since the… the breakup of my marriage um… just going out and.. and seeing people and um… having people um… sort of pass me by sometimes without… 

00:11:45
FRANK WILLS nice, nice… 

00:11:45
ROZAR (ph) …sort of um… acknowledging me that… that’s been really upsetting and I’ve got home and just not been able to stop crying really. 

00:12:00
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:12:00
ROZAR (ph) And… 

00:12:00
FRANK WILLS So you felt a bit isolated kind of thing… 

00:12:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… yeah… 

00:12:05
FRANK WILLS Okay… 

00:12:05
ROZAR (ph) …and you know, the… the people and that I used to um… so socialize with often that was through um… relations of my… my… my husband’s family because I wasn’t brought up here and everything is sort of filtered through contacts with them and his family and since we’ve broken up um… it feels that people are very different and… and I just feel that I need to stay by myself and… 

00:12:40
FRANK WILLS Right… Right… 

00:12:40
ROZAR (ph) …and… 

00:12:45
FRANK WILLS Okay. (inaudible ) that they are right then that um… you know you came from… you come from Bristol… 

00:12:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:12:50
FRANK WILLS Right so that when you went to see your sister you went to Bristol… 

00:12:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:12:50
FRANK WILLS Did your husband come from Cardiff and… 

00:12:55
ROZAR (ph) Yes… yes… 

00:12:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah I see… 

00:12:55
ROZAR (ph) Yes. 

00:12:55
FRANK WILLS Alright and… and somehow or the other that’s further contributed to your isolation… 

00:13:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I part of coming across to… to Cardiff and I neither they had sort of a long history of… of having um… immigrants… 

00:13:15
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:13:15
ROZAR (ph) …there. So I didn’t have any sort of huge concerns about coming and living Wales because it’s since it’s where husband was from and I thought I would be able to relate to people… 

00:13:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:13:30
ROZAR (ph) Very quickly. 

00:13:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:13:30
ROZAR (ph) Um… um… but I didn’t find that… 

00:13:35
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:13:35
ROZAR (ph) I… I found that people were um… more distant in… in… in Bristol. This is sort of unspoken protocol almost where you… if you… you are passing somebody um… another westerner and you would just naturally nod or… 

00:13:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:13:55
ROZAR (ph) …indicate some why that… that… that you’ve noticed them and that was just something I always did from a very young age and um… coming to Cardiff when you do something similar you… you’ve just get nothing. No response and so… 

00:14:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:14:10
ROZAR (ph) Over time I found that most of the people I was able to connect with from the western community… 

00:14:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:14:20
ROZAR (ph) …was through my husband’s family. 

00:14:20
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:14:20
ROZAR (ph) …rather than any other way… 

00:14:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah… Yeah… 

00:14:25
ROZAR (ph) and… and… and so when um… we separated and um… and then divorced, all of what I thought was a um… you know I felt I thought had a place… 

00:14:40
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:14:40
ROZAR (ph) …in the community. I’d found a place. 

00:14:45
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:14:45
ROZAR (ph) …finally to fit in. 

00:14:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:45
ROZAR (ph) That seem to… to go and… and even people that perhaps would socialize within the past, I felt ignored by them. 

00:14:55
FRANK WILLS I mean, one of the things that… that unfortunately sometimes happens after a separation… 

00:15:00
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:15:05
FRANK WILLS …is that kind of people take sides. 

00:15:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:15:05
FRANK WILLS As it were. Is there a bit of that in… 

00:15:05
ROZAR (ph) I… I feel that… that probably was the case we… we had um… friends who lived fairly nearby. Um… who we know definitely um… were close to my… my husband’s family and so I know from their unwillingness really to… to… um… remain close to me. I feel that distance which wasn’t there before. And I… I… guess they feel that their loyalty is to um… my husband’s family. 

00:15:45
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:15:45
ROZAR (ph) But that leaves me feeling um… really isolated at times. 

00:15:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah and… and unless it’s a (inaudible ) because this is time when you are actually do need to connect with people and… and have a bit of support. 

00:16:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:16:05
FRANK WILLS But it feels almost like the… the opposite… 

00:16:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah I feel… 

00:16:10
FRANK WILLS …to you. 

00:16:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah and its… I heard sometime. 

00:16:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:16:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:16:15
FRANK WILLS So we… we’ve almost kind of get these polarize situation and then we in this you know Bristol is a bit of a haven for you… 

00:16:20
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:16:20
FRANK WILLS …as it where place where you can go and feel welcome and you know have a bit of fun with people and connect with people where as Cardiff just really doesn’t… doesn’t feel that way to you. 

00:16:35
ROZAR (ph) No, no. 

00:16:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:16:35
ROZAR (ph) Its… It’s definitely… it feels as if um… I don’t feel as if I am safe sometimes. 

00:16:45
FRANK WILLS Right. Right. 

00:16:45
ROZAR (ph) …leaving my home. It doesn’t… 

00:16:45
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:16:50
ROZAR (ph) …feel welcoming. 

00:16:50
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:16:50
ROZAR (ph) And I don’t feel like I fit in any more. 

00:16:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:16:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. The certain thing you want to add about that clip we have just seen. 

00:17:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. I mean it always strikes me how much you… you learn about the client’s actual life from… from hearing these accounts of what they’ve been doing. For example, I mean we hadn’t discussed the her relationship with her sister particularly before that, but you get a real sense of the quality of that relationship in… in this particular extract. And another matter which a therapist he would be really focusing on um… this little bit a behavioral theory which goes with this, you recognize some of the… the… the terminology, but we were looking at you know, what is rewarding her behaviors… what's… what's lying it’s a main those behaviors happen again. I’m rewarding in the sense of um… in this case the rewarding the positive behaviors… 

00:17:55
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:17:55
FRANK WILLS …when she is socially engaged what rewards come from that and also you know what is not rewarding her behaviors and we see some of the apparent hostility she meets when she tries to go out and in… in her home setting. And this concept is called the… the idea of the rewarding environment, looking at what in a person’s environment is encouraging its behavior, in one way rather than another. 

00:18:30
MIKE SIMMONS And what we are actually seeing here it’s all… it’s kind of geographically based. There is Bristol which is good and Cardiff which is bad for Rozar(ph). 

00:18:40
FRANK WILLS This too seems to reinforce… attempts to socially connect with people… 

00:18:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… 

00:18:45
FRANK WILLS …and Cardiff doesn’t, and of course it’s important to make the point there is nothing to do with those two cities as… as entity… 

00:18:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:18:50
FRANK WILLS …it’s just the way they are working out in their life at this particular um… moment in time. 

00:18:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. What are we going to see next? 

00:19:00
FRANK WILLS I was referring before to the way one tends to initially use the activity schedule as a way of looking back over retrospectively how the client has been behaving and have been operating in the social environment. But then at some stage you can um… move into a different mode which is looking forward to how she may be able to behave in slightly different ways which are in line with all… all therapeutic targets. One of which is here that she will become more socially engaged because she has been socially engaged… 

00:19:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:19:40
FRANK WILLS …in the past. Was keen to do that and got… got benefits from engaged and now she is you know, missing that and that’s become part of the depressive cycle. So here we are looking out for some… some way of um… promoting some new behavior. New in the sense of from where she standing now. All though it may reflect behavior she has had before the depression kind of thing which will lead… lead her to feel more engaged and more and more positive about her… her life in general. 

00:20:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Can you just tell about (inaudible ) I’m just thinking we are kind of joking about Cardiff and Bristol, but what I’m aware of is had this client not decided to do something about us to seek therapy. She might have decided to… to focus on the thought that I’m stuck in this place in Cardiff. So nothing is going to happen. I’m not going to be able to do anything. It’s all bad. If only I was back in Bristol… 

00:20:50
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:20:50
MIKE SIMMONS …everything will be okay. 

00:20:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Hmm… 

00:20:50
MIKE SIMMONS And… and what you are doing is actually working with her to look at an alternative in the sense to either being stuck there or I guess moving back to Bristol. 

00:21:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. That’s… That’s a really good point and it often comes up actually because you might say okay, well why doesn’t she move to Bristol and that’s the solution why I have therapy etcetera… and indeed that might eventually be um… part of a solution. But… But as… as is often the case the… the devil is in the detail and even if you… it were a totally a desirable thing to do there are certain aspects which you are tending to keep her in Cardiff like the education and… 

00:21:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:35
FRANK WILLS …children so forth. It’s not that easy to just uproot and go. But also um… psychologically in a sense if you just pat on your byes and left kind of thing, then your retreating as it were and… and there is a sense of defeat in you… 

00:21:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:50
FRANK WILLS So some times its better. I mean, it’s all up to the clients who make the choice in the end of the day and sometimes they are appropriate reasons to retreat as it were. But maybe better to really think about well, you know how can I bring this passage to as close as it were in… in the way that’s the best it could be even if its imperfect and then maybe consider whether I want to move later or something. 

00:22:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. Okay so let’s have a look at that now. 

00:22:25
FRANK WILLS If we take that in… in terms of you know, some of our objectives for doing this… 

00:22:25
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… Hmm… 

00:22:30
FRANK WILLS …particular piece of work were as I said you earlier you… you should be a bit more active and… 

00:22:35
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:22:35
FRANK WILLS …confined, pleasurable things to do. 

00:22:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:22:35
FRANK WILLS So we have one area at least… 

00:22:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmmm… 

00:22:40
FRANK WILLS You know, connect with people you know and your family and friends in Bristol. Um… But the fact is (inaudible ) where as you all living in Cardiff at the moment. 

00:22:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS So you can’t keep on I guess going over to Bristol every day to get that. So we do need to think a little bit about whether you can start to slowly rebuild some connections with… 

00:23:00
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:23:00
FRANK WILLS …with you know a more local people in your own community but you… I guess you feel a bit pessimistic about that… 

00:23:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I… I just feel… I don’t feel very confident about that. I’m… I’m not sure how I’d go about doing that… 

00:23:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:23:25
ROZAR (ph) …and yeah it feels really… I can’t pitch in myself… 

00:23:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:23:35
ROZAR (ph) Um… almost being friends with anyone… 

00:23:45
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

00:23:45
ROZAR (ph) …here at the moment. 

00:23:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:23:45
ROZAR (ph) It just doesn’t feel as if that’s possible. 

00:23:50
FRANK WILLS Right okay. Well, can… can I try and work with that with you… 

00:23:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:23:55
FRANK WILLS …a bit you know, um… because you know part of the um… activity schedule is not just about reviewing a week is just going, but at some stage we can also use it’s a planned for weeks ahead. 

00:24:05
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:24:10
FRANK WILLS So um… let’s see if we can find anything that you could do and it can just… it can just be quite a small thing. 

00:24:15
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:24:15
FRANK WILLS You know where you might get a bit of… bit more of a welcome or a… or a… 

00:24:20
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:24:20
FRANK WILLS …you know positive reaction or whatever. 

00:24:25
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:24:25
FRANK WILLS Um… I mean one… one thing I said I don’t know if you would agree with this, but part of (inaudible ) it feels like all people around you are bit so against you… 

00:24:35
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:24:35
FRANK WILLS …or something like that. 

00:24:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:24:35
FRANK WILLS …you know. Whereas in actual fact um… you know in most groups of people it’s very rare that very one feels exactly the same. 

00:24:45
ROZAR (ph) Right. 

00:24:45
FRANK WILLS …you know, there will be some people no doubt who are pretty dubious you know, hesitant to contact you. 

00:24:55
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:24:55
FRANK WILLS But there may be some other people who perhaps not as far into that. 

00:25:00
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:25:05
FRANK WILLS What do you think about that? 

00:25:05
ROZAR (ph) I think that’s… I think that maybe true. 

00:25:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:25:15
ROZAR (ph) But how… 

00:25:15
FRANK WILLS So it’s a kind of testable then we could test it little bit. 

00:25:20
ROZAR (ph) How do we do that? 

00:25:20
FRANK WILLS Well, I mean may… maybe one thing that you could do is just if we could identify a couple of people who you think… think might be just a little perhaps a little bit more sympathetic, we could you know plan some kind of initiative you could take to perhaps speak to them or… 

00:25:40
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS …you know just to check out what they all… 

00:25:40
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS …how they all feel. Is that sounds scary? 

00:25:45
ROZAR (ph) It… It feels scary, but… 

00:25:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Because you… you know you say it doesn’t feel safe as it were. 

00:25:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:25:50
FRANK WILLS So we want to take a low risk. 

00:25:50
ROZAR (ph) Yes. 

00:25:50
FRANK WILLS To begin with. 

00:25:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:25:55
FRANK WILLS What do you think? 

00:25:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. Hmm… 

00:26:00
FRANK WILLS I mean let’s… can I… sorry, you… you… are you thinking about something. What are you thinking? 

00:26:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, I’d… I see you speaking I'm thinking about, you said to think about a couple of people… 

00:26:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:26:10
ROZAR (ph) …who… who may know… just think um… picking of the same ways as… as other people I feel. 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:26:25
ROZAR (ph) Anyway, it’s just… but they just not for me really, um… and I heard all sorts of things being said about me, um… which aren't very nice. 

00:26:40
FRANK WILLS So, you know, some people are definitely in that kind. 

00:26:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:26:40
FRANK WILLS Because I… you don’t need to name them I suppose. 

00:26:45
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… Yeah. But um… my friend Jose(ph) and um… and Sam, they’ve always been really um… really supportive of me… 

00:27:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:27:05
ROZAR (ph) … to be honest and even before the divorce, they… they rang, or you know they said things that really actually help me. 

00:27:15
FRANK WILLS What it’s, ah… ah… are they living in… in… 

00:27:15
ROZAR (ph) They… They actually live in Cardiff. 

00:27:20
FRANK WILLS Right… Right. 

00:27:20
ROZAR (ph) But I haven’t seen anybody, so haven’t seen them either… 

00:27:20
FRANK WILLS Right… Right… Right. 

00:27:20
ROZAR (ph) …haven’t sort of um, linked up with anybody. 

00:27:25
FRANK WILLS Right… Right. 

00:27:25
ROZAR (ph) But just thinking about as you speak and um… maybe… maybe there is somebody that I can… maybe contact. 

00:27:35
FRANK WILLS Right. So, are… are they I… are they um… many friends? 

00:27:40
ROZAR (ph) Um… there are couple. 

00:27:45
FRANK WILLS Couple, right… right. 

00:27:45
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:27:45
FRANK WILLS Right. And… And you know what… what’s um… what might you do to… 

00:27:50
ROZAR (ph) Well I’ve got um… 

00:27:50
FRANK WILLS …someone had initiative. 

00:27:55
ROZAR (ph) I’ve got Jose's(ph) telephone number, and I suppose I could I don’t know if I could talk, or maybe like I could text. 

00:28:10
FRANK WILLS Right… right and so far good write to open things as a bit… 

00:28:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:28:10
FRANK WILLS …isn’t, you know. 

00:28:15
ROZAR (ph) That thought maybe as (inaudible ) I don’t know. 

00:28:16
FRANK WILLS Yeah… Yeah… and what’s sort of text would you… could you… 

00:28:20
ROZAR (ph) Um… 

00:28:20
FRANK WILLS …send? 

00:28:25
ROZAR (ph) Um… How… How… How are you doing? Um… Get in touch or something like that I don’t know. 

00:28:30
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah… yeah… yeah… and… and… how and what would you write the chances of them responding positively to that? 

00:28:40
ROZAR (ph) Um… I think about 50/50. 

00:28:50
FRANK WILLS Right… right. Yeah. 

00:28:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:28:50
FRANK WILLS On the other hand, you often a bit pessimistic of the moments (inaudible ). 

00:28:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, so I can’t… I can’t be anything more than that… 

00:28:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:28:55
ROZAR (ph) even if they are… 

00:28:55
FRANK WILLS Yes, right. 

00:28:55
ROZAR (ph) …really nice people… 

00:28:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:29:00
ROZAR (ph) …and have been. 

00:29:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah… Yeah. 

00:29:00
ROZAR (ph) I… I… I’m just not sure of anybody at the moment. 

00:29:00
FRANK WILLS Right. It’s strikes me that… that theme of uncertainty is coming up again. 

00:29:05
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:05
FRANK WILLS This time in relation to what we’re talking about in our outside life. Perhaps a little bit reflected about what’s going on in the session as well and there is a sense that um… for Rozar(ph) to try and do something like this. She doesn’t really have a picture of being able to do it, which makes it less likely that she will do it. So, part of this is about um… developing the idea in her own mind of how she could do it and for her to get the sense that she could do it and therefore it’s important to… to give her the time to um… think and… they… explore this and begin to see the possibility on their own mind. So, I think it’s good here that I… I… do give her that… that space and recognize that she… she is kind of in two minds about it. 

00:30:05
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:05
FRANK WILLS Because it’s when people are in two minds that the… the possibility of change starts to develop. 

00:30:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yeah… yeah… yeah. Okay, and then we're moving on to the next clip and what we’re going to see there? 

00:30:20
FRANK WILLS Well, in this clip what we’re looking for is to build own this idea of an active… positive activity in the client can actually do and we need to build up the intention to actually try and show that… that will happen or… 

00:30:35
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:35
FRANK WILLS …to maximize the chances that it will happen. Again sort of building up that picture in her mind that we were… we were talking about say earlier. Because it’s easy and we all know from own life to have an idea, I will do this that or the other, but then if don’t have a plan to carry it out, there is always a possibility that it will just slip off the agenda. 

00:31:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. We have gotten memories of doing relationship work and setting home with couples and they come back the next week and they haven’t done it and that’s interesting and you can work with well what happened and… and you learn more about them, but in the end actually doing the work is a really valuable thing. 

00:31:20
FRANK WILLS That’s right. We… We were always encouraged to… to think that well as the client doesn’t do, we can make something a little bit, but sure doesn’t feel like it much you can make out if they… they do, do it, although one interesting thing that’s um… also arises of course that they do it, but it doesn’t goes to plan. 

00:31:40
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:40
FRANK WILLS And it may be helpful and that might be in the client’s mind of course, that might be one of the things that would stop them do it (inaudible ) the imagining it, doing it and it going badly. 

00:31:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… Yeah. 

00:31:50
FRANK WILLS So, it is often helpful to discuss some kind of full back plan and we actually do that in this next clip as well as the positive planning of the activity. 

00:32:00
MIKE SIMMONS Actually, we look at that though. 

00:32:05
FRANK WILLS Let’s do that. Do you agree that this is important to try and connect with some people right now? 

00:32:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, because it does not feel very nice being… 

00:32:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:32:15
ROZAR (ph) …being on my own. 

00:32:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah. Okay so that is something that you could do and aren’t you… do you think you would do this actually? 

00:32:20
ROZAR (ph) Um… I could. 

00:32:25
FRANK WILLS Right. You’re hedging (inaudible ) a bit. 

00:32:31
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:32:31
FRANK WILLS Yeah… Yeah. 

00:32:31
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:32:31
FRANK WILLS Okay, um… well I tell you… tell you one thing. I wonder if it might help you to motivate yourself to do it. Um… if we had a full background. 

00:32:40
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:32:45
FRANK WILLS If sometimes, you know if it goes wrong that… that’s in affairs and if it gets wrong, so can we a think a little bit about you know, if it did go wrong and you texted them and they didn’t text back, um… or they text back in a negative way, and how… how could you actually cope with that do you think be disappointing. I guess. 

00:33:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I think I’ll definitely be upset. 

00:33:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:33:10
ROZAR (ph) If… If… If I didn't hear from them. 

00:33:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:33:15
ROZAR (ph) Um… or if they said something that wasn’t… 

00:33:20
FRANK WILLS Wasn’t… Wasn’t positive approach(ph). 

00:33:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:33:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:33:25
ROZAR (ph) But… But I guess on this I give it a try. 

00:33:30
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah. 

00:33:30
ROZAR (ph) I’m not gonna know… 

00:33:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah. 

00:33:30
ROZAR (ph) So maybe it’s… 

00:33:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I mean um… is there any… anything which could… you know I’m… I’m just thinking as a worst case scenario… 

00:33:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:33:40
FRANK WILLS Um… I’m not saying this is the most likely. 

00:33:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:40
FRANK WILLS I think it probably isn’t the most likely. 

00:33:45
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:33:45
FRANK WILLS But if it did you know who… who could you contact where you know you would get some you say, you know you could tell… tell them what had happened you know, you get… 

00:33:50
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:33:50
FRANK WILLS …some positive support? 

00:33:55
ROZAR (ph) Well, my sister 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS Your sister… 

00:33:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS …sounds it good back, yeah. 

00:33:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS She… She is um… 

00:34:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah. What would she say anything? 

00:34:00
ROZAR (ph) She… She… 

00:34:00
FRANK WILLS that’s happened. 

00:34:00
ROZAR (ph) She… She’d probably say “Look don’t worry about it.” Um… 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
ROZAR (ph) Well I just know she try and make me feel better. 

00:34:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:20
ROZAR (ph) She will say… 

00:34:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:20
ROZAR (ph) …something that probably say something to try and make me laugh and… 

00:34:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:25
ROZAR (ph) …and probably say something really cheeky. 

00:34:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:30
ROZAR (ph) And that will sort of… I guess up to… 

00:34:35
FRANK WILLS No, she is bit cheeky, is she? 

00:34:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:34:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, so, yeah definitely I’m not sure what she would say. 

00:34:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:40
ROZAR (ph) Um… she likes them to… 

00:34:45
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:34:45
ROZAR (ph) try much and that um… 

00:34:45
FRANK WILLS She knows them. 

00:34:45
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. She might even suggest bringing… that she contact them. 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS That’s nice, yes. So it could be another… because you know… you know sometimes what… what happens is I mean they could be on holiday or something. 

00:35:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:00
FRANK WILLS You’d be thinking "Oh they don’t come,” but it could be another reason, so… 

00:35:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… Yeah. 

00:35:05
FRANK WILLS You know it’s also important to remember that. 

00:35:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:05
FRANK WILLS It could be other reasons why. 

00:35:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:10
FRANK WILLS What people do or don’t do things. 

00:35:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, that’s sort of thing my sister would say… 

00:35:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:35:15
ROZAR (ph) …probably, because she has been trying to get me out… 

00:35:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:35:20
ROZAR (ph) …and… 

00:35:20
FRANK WILLS Because she kind of (inaudible ) really… 

00:35:23
ROZAR (ph) Right. 

00:35:23
FRANK WILLS …in the relation to… 

00:35:23
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Or I suppose you know… you know if um… if it all does go, (inaudible ) doesn’t work, you know you can always go to Bristol you know and reconnect there and… 

00:35:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:35
FRANK WILLS …and you know. 

00:35:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:40
FRANK WILLS Um… as you say and if you don’t try things, then you know you can’t succeed at things. 

00:35:45
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:45
FRANK WILLS But I… I recognize that you know… you… you… you… you requires… in you know in low mood so. 

00:35:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:55
FRANK WILLS It’s how to feel confident and… 

00:35:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:35:55
FRANK WILLS I would go… 

00:35:55
ROZAR (ph) (crosstalk)(inaudible ). 

00:35:57
ROZAR (ph) I still feels quite rule at the moment. 

00:36:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah… 

00:36:00
ROZAR (ph) And… I suppose I just don’t wanna be hurt to get. 

00:36:05
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah… yeah… and that makes absolutely. 

00:36:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:36:05
FRANK WILLS So, which is why it is important to have a full back plan. 

00:36:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:36:10
FRANK WILLS And… And anyway do you think maybe that is something you could have a go at and maybe… maybe… before we meet next… next time. 

00:36:20
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… yeah, yes. 

00:36:20
FRANK WILLS I… I don’t want to push you in it. 

00:36:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS So, we don’t want to go. 

00:36:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I’ve got call Jose’s number. 

00:36:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:36:30
ROZAR (ph) So, um… that is something I could. 

00:36:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah… Yeah… 

00:36:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:36:35
FRANK WILLS And if it does happen that you don’t do that, please don’t feel bad about say, you know I mean that because quite often you, if you… you know you… when you came back and you tell me you haven’t done something like that that we thought it might be useful to do. 

00:36:50
ROZAR (ph) Hmm. 

00:36:50
FRANK WILLS Then, we can get quite a lot from analyzing why you didn’t tell these sort of things. So, it’s… it’s equally helpful… 

00:36:55
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:37:00
FRANK WILLS …to me if you don’t do it… 

00:37:00
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

00:37:00
FRANK WILLS …as if you actually do it. 

00:37:00
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:37:00
FRANK WILLS These are just you know, I mean changes generally you know step by step and often is quite small steps and… 

00:37:10
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:37:10
FRANK WILLS …and some you know it takes time… 

00:37:10
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:37:10
FRANK WILLS …and patience really on whole of balance… 

00:37:15
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…Hmm… 

00:37:15
FRANK WILLS I think. 

00:37:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. Well I think I can… I’ll try the text in and it’s bit easier than… 

00:37:20
FRANK WILLS Yes… yeah… 

00:37:20
ROZAR (ph) …than ringing… 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS You know that’s right. 

00:37:25
ROZAR (ph)…and speaking to them. 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah… I think so. 

00:37:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah… yeah… and… and… you know, you can step up from that if… 

00:37:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:37:30
FRANK WILLS …if the first goes okay. What strikes me here is how helpful imagining the worst case can actually… 

00:37:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:37:40
FRANK WILLS …intuitively, it sometimes feels like not a good way to go, but I’m afraid I do have some good will’s is low, which is if you can imagine the worst case and feel you could manage it, then it makes that worst case much less likely… 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah of course. Of course. 

00:37:55
FRANK WILLS …to happen. So as we imagine the worst case that she gets poor or… or negative feedback from this activity she… she tries. We also have the… the antidote of the possibility of using her sister’s support as a way of getting over that… 

00:38:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:38:10
FRANK WILLS …disappointment and again, the sister, relationship with the sister emerges strongly the and it’s kind of almost (inaudible ) you can feel the pleasure on the, see the smile on the face that she imagines what her sister might say about it and again, I think that’s starts to fill out that empty space of not be able to imagine how such an activity would go… 

00:38:35
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:38:35
FRANK WILLS …that we… we discussed earlier. 

00:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS And we’re moving on to the next clip now. What do we’re gonna be looking out there? 

00:38:45
FRANK WILLS In the sense as an extension of the last clip and that will look at what else she might ah… do in the upcoming week and I just ask her to fairly open way that she will what else might you do and she starts to talk about her son is that, which his birthday and how it happens and you get quite an interesting feel of the relationship with her son. 

00:39:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:39:10
FRANK WILLS Which is relevant to a later discussion as we will see, but also again reveals this the interpersonally… the importance of the interpersonal environment and reveals some of her history about her own self images that kind of you know, a caretaker, and then nurturer… 

00:39:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:30
FRANK WILLS …and not being a very important part of who she thinks she is, um… a little bit of who she thinks she’s lost for time piece of getting back to that, his helpful. Behaviorally and probably cognitively here as well because it’s… it’s reconnecting with her more ah… functional and positive use of herself. 

00:39:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so we look at that now. 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS Let’s do that. Okay and any… anything else about next week, you know you got anything… anything to look forward to next week? 

00:40:05
ROZAR (ph) Um… 

00:40:05
FRANK WILLS In terms of something you'll enjoy. 

00:40:10
ROZAR (ph) Okay. Well, I haven’t planned anything special, but it’s um… it’s one of my son’s birthday. 

00:40:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:40:25
ROZAR (ph) Um… ah… Friday next week and I… I used to love cooking and… 

00:40:30
FRANK WILLS Right… right. 

00:40:30
ROZAR (ph) …doing all of that and having done that for a long time, done any so special um… sort of West Indian meals… 

00:40:40
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:40:45
ROZAR (ph) …which he enjoys and they enjoy and… and… really doing something special, because um… that may be something that… that I could do because I know they enjoy it. 

00:40:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:40:55
ROZAR (ph) And… and… 

00:41:00
FRANK WILLS What’s his favorite dish? 

00:41:00
ROZAR (ph) Um… it’s um… curried mutton, um… rice and peas we call it, but it’s actually kidney beans. 

00:41:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:41:10
ROZAR (ph) And um… um… chicken, um… sort of (inaudible ) chicken, which is special West Indians seasoning and lots of other things which they… they enjoy um… so I think my son might be pleasantly surprised. 

00:41:35
FRANK WILLS Right… right. 

00:41:35
ROZAR (ph) If I did that and because I’ve always had a lot pleasure at two of them as soon as be in a homemaker really. 

00:41:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah. 

00:41:45
ROZAR (ph) And… 

00:41:45
FRANK WILLS It’s a literally and nourishing people. 

00:41:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:41:50
FRANK WILLS Kind of… 

00:41:50
ROZAR (ph) And I sort of lost the desire really to… 

00:41:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:42:00
ROZAR (ph) …do any of that. 

00:42:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:42:00
ROZAR (ph) Um… when my husband left it. 

00:42:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:42:05
ROZAR (ph) Just felt different and but and I think I’ll give a try now. 

00:42:10
FRANK WILLS Okay, very nice, well I have been (inaudible ) you know… how… how that goes and… 

00:42:16
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:42:16
FRANK WILLS It sounds great. And I would like… I would like (inaudible )back… 

00:42:22
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:42:22
FRANK WILLS Well let say that. Um… okay. So… So, um… I think we… we… I think we can place it that’s little agenda right… 

00:42:30
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:42:30
FRANK WILLS …does it feel okay so move on to. 

00:42:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:42:35
FRANK WILLS … or anything else you want to say about it? 

00:42:35
ROZAR (ph) Ah… Ah… 

00:42:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. I mean I think it’s just the… the principle is like you know to try… try to just be a little bit more active and say how things dotted in the way that you will enjoy, they didn’t have to be huge things. 

00:42:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:42:50
FRANK WILLS That… Those are two things that we are working on. Did… Did that seem reasonable? 

00:42:55
ROZAR (ph) Ah… that seems um… 

00:43:00
FRANK WILLS Points to you. 

00:43:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, I seem… I think sometimes it feels too much for me, ah… 

00:43:05
FRANK WILLS Right, of course. 

00:43:05
ROZAR (ph) …when I have things to do and I feel quite overwhelmed at times. 

00:43:10
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

00:43:10
ROZAR (ph) But um… sort of… you sort of breaking it down the way you have. 

00:43:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:43:20
ROZAR (ph) May… Maybe that, maybe I can do… do those things. 

00:43:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:43:25
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:43:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Just small steps and you know small steps. 

00:43:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:43:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Is there are anything else she want to say about that clip before we move on? 

00:43:35
FRANK WILLS Yes, there is and… and actually this is only struck me relatively recently, actually despite having watching the tape quite a large number of times before, it seems to me that we’re very relaxed on this stage… 

00:43:50
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:50
FRANK WILLS …of the session. Very interpersonally attuned and I’ve been thinking about what light(ph) is that we’ve reached that points at… at this moments and it’s seems to me that… there are two things one we’ve just kind of come up with a quite a realistic ah… positive plan as it were… 

00:44:15
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:15
FRANK WILLS …which seems like it’s got a fair chance of working out, but also um… a lots of (inaudible ) more positive identity has been shared with me and this points and… and I’m getting a feel of that person that she remembers herself having been and which was the pleasure… 

00:44:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

00:44:35
FRANK WILLS …and pride to her. Ah… and I think this is interesting, because the point we’re going to go to next actually is a point when there was a slightest, ever so slight I think really interpersonal breakdown between us. Ah… this where I’m asking her to engage in an activity that’s of doing of a pie chart and she is noticeably reluctant and… 

00:45:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

00:45:05
FRANK WILLS …a little bit scared of doing so, ah… and I think it was maybe possibly fortuitous, but it… it so happens that it… if directly follows in my perception and moment where we were very interpersonally attuned, which I think then helps us to manage this slight breakdown. 

00:45:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

00:45:25
FRANK WILLS You know, pretty well (inaudible ). 

00:45:31
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, we’re going to see you that in the next clip. Is there are anything else we should be looking out for? 

00:45:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I think it’s important to know that we… we are now moving onto our second agenda right and the first one was a… a consideration of her activity schedule both retrospectively over the last week and (inaudible ) planning for the upcoming week and now we’re… we’re talking about the incident with her… with her son, which she reported to me right to the very start of the session and we put on the agenda and we’re particularly focusing on a thought, it’s; that she had it, it’s all my fault. 

00:46:10
MIKE SIMMONS Alright. 

00:46:15
FRANK WILLS Everything is going wrong in the family, it’s all my fault. But as we do this, I ask her to um… to take um… the board with a piece of paper and so she can draw the pie chart, which are going to use to examine this thought and you know, she is very reluctant. 

00:46:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:46:30
FRANK WILLS And… and happy and I think this… this skill that I’m able to use that is one that these commands of lots of models of therapy as she called a (inaudible ) where I’m able to pours on the moment and just reflect on that this seems all good. 

00:46:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

00:46:50
FRANK WILLS And I’m also able to add some other observations that I’ve been made before previously about this client in a sense, I’ve been storing these observations, because they may or may not be relevant and I decide, I’ll make um… a therapy decision at this point to actually bring these down off the shelf and say and also that these things are happening I’m wondering if there is a connection here and so we’re able to what we were doing here is exploring the interpersonal ah… space between us, which is an activity, which is not readily identified with um… CBT. 

00:47:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… 

00:47:30
FRANK WILLS But one which I’ve been trying to argue is one that can make CBT um… more interpersonally sensitive and therefore, probably more effective. 

00:47:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right, okay let’s look at that. 

00:47:45
FRANK WILLS Ah… we can understand why… why… actually good to set that perhaps… 

00:47:50
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:47:50
FRANK WILLS …there are other reasons other than it being a totally accurate description of what’s been happening. But as you are saying part of the trouble is that a bit of you believe is kind of thing. 

00:48:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:48:05
FRANK WILLS You know... and you know, when we thought of a couple of sessions ago about negative thoughts. I mean, feeling like it’s all my fault… 

00:48:15
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:48:15
FRANK WILLS …which is thought that you have, that’s quite a negative thoughts, you know just kind of critical of yourself and most people when they have thoughts like that they feel and they’re feeling quite bad. 

00:48:25
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…hmm… 

00:48:25
FRANK WILLS So, I wonder would it be helpful to examine that thoughts a bit, because you know from what you said and you know your husband did this and quite difficult things… 

00:48:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmm…hmm… 

00:48:40
FRANK WILLS …and you try quite hard to make it work, so it feels a bit hard to conclude that it was all your fault, but… but can we do something just sort of explore as a bit? 

00:48:55
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:48:55
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS Is that okay for you? 

00:48:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS What I would like to do actually is to do something called an um… a pie chart… 

00:49:05
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:49:05
FRANK WILLS …there is involves you drawing something you can writing stuff down is that okay? 

00:49:10
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:49:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah. 

00:49:10
ROZAR (ph) I suppose… 

00:49:15
FRANK WILLS You are bit… You are bit hesitant. 

00:49:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, in terms of what you want me to write down. 

00:49:20
FRANK WILLS Right… right. You know… know something (inaudible ) few times ah… when I’ve said this to you. There is almost a phase sometimes that… that you know if I just (inaudible ) you won’t do it right or… 

00:49:31
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:49:31
FRANK WILLS …something like that. 

00:49:31
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… yeah. 

00:49:31
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:49:35
ROZAR (ph) I guess… I guess just… this important to get it right isn’t? 

00:49:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Well it’s important to tell me what you… you feel and what you think and it doesn’t have to be right as it were, you know it just has to be truly from you, which is… which is what you do I think anyway, so… 

00:49:55
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:50:00
FRANK WILLS …you know its… it’s not about pleasing me sort of things is it this is about trying to you know find out what’s what we can do so… so help you out and you know, there is a lot of hit and miss in it actually. 

00:50:10
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:50:15
FRANK WILLS And I think and you know sometimes, we will do something and it… it won’t work and it won’t be… it won’t be a reflection of (inaudible ) just wasn’t… wasn’t the right thing, so I think it’s very much you know… you know give a try and see and how it goes and I think that’s the spirit to have. 

00:50:30
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS Do you… it’s that okay? 

00:50:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. So… So anything you do here is fine, but I’ll guide you anyway as… 

00:50:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:50:40
FRANK WILLS …as we’re doing so. 

00:50:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:50:40
FRANK WILLS I’ll tell you step by step what to do. 

00:50:45
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:50:45
FRANK WILLS Ah… ah… again, I’m… I’m struck here about um… Rozar’s(ph) attentiveness and I think I’m now genuinely in… in the clip, in two minds. I’m not sure whether to persist with this in a sense to push her a bit into doing it or where to go somewhere else… 

00:51:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… 

00:51:05
FRANK WILLS …entirely and you… you’ve to make those decisions quite quickly, you can’t kind of sit there. I don’t know what to do. So and I decide to… to go… go on with it and interestingly in… in the… at the end of the session, we have feedback is how she not included on this tape of discussions of the feedback, but the… the points that um… Rozar(ph) made when we discussed this, because I’m as aware of having feeling (inaudible ) I was pushing her too much at some stages and I… I raised that with her and… and she said that she… she did actually feel quite uncomfortable about it, but she felt she was glad I done it. 

00:51:50
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… Yeah. 

00:51:50
FRANK WILLS Because something very useful um… ah… came out, but of course you can't know that’s going to happen, before you actually do it. And I’ve wondered whether there was anything else I could have um… some approach I could have done at that moment. For example I could have said well okay. Can we, can we explore this thought in another way and that would have been very collaborative and so forth and I guess this for those people watching the tape for a Rogerian angle they may well feel uncomfortable with what I did, they may well feel that I… I perhaps should have done something different. 

00:52:30
MIKE SIMMONS And something was, was coming to my mind is something about how do you have backed away, is that modeling in some way her(ph) perhaps backing away from other activities. 

00:52:45
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:52:45
MIKE SIMMONS Outside would that make sense? 

00:52:50
FRANK WILLS Yes, whether I’ve been enough to think that quickly as you used to… (crosstalk) and I guess part of the reason is when you’re with client your attention is very focused… 

00:53:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:53:00
FRANK WILLS …on it, but these are all interesting things, aren't they and in a sense would be a good thing to talk about in supervision and another concept I’ve been trying to interest CBT people in which is a bit outside the discipline is the idea of the internal supervising of the sort of the thing that Patrick Casement talks about that somehow the idea of having one foot in and one foot out and that sometimes if you particularly if you become attuned to these things you can actually have a think… have a quick think about that and decide which way to go. So you might have had the little notified back of her something may ring in that process. 

00:53:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, Okay, so what are we gonna see in the next clip? 

00:53:45
FRANK WILLS Oh, in the next clip now we move directly into using the pie-chart and the basic idea of the pie-chart it’s often used when people seem to be assuming too much responsibility for a particular events and therefore, you know giving themselves a bad time in having lots of negative feelings coming from that. And it seems to go with the particular set of attitude about responsibility. And so it’s quite helpful than to get the person to think about all the factors that might have contributed to this and so the particular this I do which is not necessarily the way that’s absolutely everyone in the field does it is that I guess to draw a blank pie-chart first and then list all the… the possible factors outside and ah… and then to fit them into the pie-chart and it’s partly an attempt… my attempt for this not to be manipulative because there are ways of manipulating the results in it by getting the clinet to put in everything to do with other people so that all the… 

00:55:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

00:55:10
FRANK WILLS And ah… there is possibly no complete way around that but at least here I’m… I’m trying to ah… to have the consideration of all the factors before we start putting them in and I think I do say when the next session when we look at putting the slices in I do say to her bear in mind we have all these things to put in. 

00:55:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes… yes. Okay shall we’ve a look at that now? 

00:55:35
FRANK WILLS Yes. Can I just pass this over to you. And what I’d like you to do is draw a kind of a circle and that’s gonna like a pie and we’re gonna slice up the pie according to the factors that we think might have been…been responsible but had an influence on the fact that you and your husband had broken up. 

00:56:00
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:56:00
FRANK WILLS Is that okay. What I’d like you to do is just list these down as we say them, write them down just by the side there for a moment. 

00:56:10
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:56:10
FRANK WILLS And then what we’ll do is we’ll put them into the pie and then divide itself according to how important a factor they were. 

00:56:15
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:56:15
FRANK WILLS So something that was very important we give a big slice of the pie for, something it was a only factor we’d give a smaller one. 

00:56:25
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:56:25
FRANK WILLS So just to get a sense really you know of… of… because… because usually in a relationship, relationships are complex and when they, when they break down the reasons are often pretty complex too and was usually quite a few of them. 

00:56:40
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:56:40
FRANK WILLS I mean let’s take… you know you told me um… you’ve implied that you know some of things that your husband was actually doing, you found very difficult to live with kinda things so… so how about telling me about… 

00:56:55
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:56:55
FRANK WILLS …some of those… what were those? 

00:57:00
ROZAR (ph) Um… I remember saying to the long absence because he is… he’s salesman and he… 

00:57:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:57:10
ROZAR (ph) He works for um… ah… this company which means he can be away two or three, four times um… days in a… in a week or sometimes chunks of time… 

00:57:25
FRANK WILLS Right, right, right. 

00:57:25
ROZAR (ph) He is away and when we were first married… 

00:57:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:57:30
ROZAR (ph) …he’d sort of always thought of get back and keep in touch but one of the things that was happing was that there were long absences um… 

00:57:45
FRANK WILLS Okay so that’s one thing to write down actually and that's not necessarily to do with him, it's to do with the job itself. The job made having time together…. 

00:57:50
ROZAR (ph) So… 

00:57:55
FRANK WILLS …difficult so if you write just where near the, the sales job as it was one factor… 

00:58:00
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

00:58:00
FRANK WILLS You know as a matter of fact you know you touched a memory neither my… my grandfather was a sailor you know he went to sea and went in sea for long… quite long periods and he was from Liverpool, you know poor town and my dad wanted to go to sea and my granddad wouldn’t let him go because he said it has such a negative effect on the family. 

00:58:25
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

00:58:25
FRANK WILLS You know this is something that happens is it you know obviously the jobs that require time away do put us on pressure from this. 

00:58:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:58:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:58:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. And this is mainly because when we first got married. I… you know he’d that same job when we were courting. 

00:58:45
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:58:45
ROZAR (ph) Um… but it didn’t seem to be a problem. 

00:58:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:58:50
ROZAR (ph) Then but we had our first child sort of quite soon after um… um… getting married a and so um… it felt you know I had this picture in my head of this being together… 

00:59:10
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:59:15
ROZAR (ph) …every night and doing things together so… 

00:59:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:59:15
ROZAR (ph) Um… It was really difficult coping with him being away. 

00:59:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:59:25
ROZAR (ph) And me being on my own… 

00:59:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:59:25
ROZAR (ph) …a lot of the time. 

00:59:25
FRANK WILLS So it’s kind of sense you actually had when you had… 

00:59:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:59:30
FRANK WILLS …had kids. 

00:59:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:59:30
FRANK WILLS And did I also remember you’re saying that not only he was away but he sort of became a bit unpredictable about when he was coming back. 

00:59:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

00:59:40
FRANK WILLS And things like that. 

00:59:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah it didn’t you know… I’d expect him back on a certain weekend and… 

00:59:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:59:45
ROZAR (ph) …and you know he'd not turn up or… 

00:59:50
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:59:55
ROZAR (ph) Sort of say that he wasn’t coming back but there is no sort of reason given and I sort of the whole week I’m anticipated and look forward to him coming back… 

01:00:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:00:10
ROZAR (ph) …and then you know this is sort of constant disappointment, um… you know my hopes will raise and then they were sort of shut down. 

01:00:20
FRANK WILLS Right and you say that sometimes you know he didn’t even tell you he wasn’t coming back… 

01:00:25
ROZAR (ph) Sometime I didn’t… I didn’t know what was happening, I didn’t felt like I was been left in the dark somehow and… but I didn’t feel very comfortable and I didn’t know what to say to the children. 

01:00:35
FRANK WILLS Right. And also you know sometime he did tell you… wasn’t really he didn’t explain why… 

01:00:45
ROZAR (ph) No, no. 

01:00:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. So the two other things that may be to write down is your husband’s unpredictability. 

01:00:55
[sil.] 

01:01:00
FRANK WILLS And you know his, his lack of communication. 

01:01:05
[sil.] 

01:01:10
FRANK WILLS So see what we’re doing here, we’re making a list of things that influenced, had an influence on things you know going downhill as it were, is there anything else you think about him for a moment, we'll come to you in a moment but think about him is there anything else that he was doing? 

01:01:25
ROZAR (ph) I think that one of the things that began to happen was um… it, he, he also said he'd stay away for what felt like really long periods of time and with all the uncertainty of not knowing whether he was coming back at given weekend or not and then eventually when he arrived back the earnings that I thought um… he had which would obviously benefit us and… and wasn’t there, the finance wasn’t there and there was no explanation for that. 

01:02:15
FRANK WILLS So he kind of he wasn’t supporting you financially. 

01:02:20
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, but began to… he was I didn’t know what was happening, I just and there was no sort of real explanation that made any sense. 

01:02:35
FRANK WILLS Okay so, so do you think we also write that down as well you know the lack of financial… 

01:02:35
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

01:02:40
FRANK WILLS …support yeah. And then… um… I was just thinking about… about um… I’m just you know putting (inaudible ) together her may be making fine(ph), so tell me… do something if I’m wrong but you know that the fact that his family seem a bit a hostile to you now was there any of that while he was still together as well. 

01:03:10
ROZAR (ph) Well, I think that it… it was there um… I thought that I almost was on… almost like I want to say on top that’s not really what I mean um… 

01:03:35
FRANK WILLS Then you’ve been scrutinized sort of thing. 

01:03:40
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, yeah. I thought that… 

01:03:40
FRANK WILLS You’re being closely watched something like that? 

01:03:40
ROZAR (ph) Yes and I know I perhaps didn’t look, didn’t have the appearance of the daughter-in-law that… may be they were hoping for I don’t know. 

01:03:55
FRANK WILLS So… you… what do you think they… 

01:04:00
ROZAR (ph) well they… 

01:04:00
FRANK WILLS They thought (inaudible ) 

01:04:03
ROZAR (ph) Well, they… they’d always made comments about my appearance. 

01:04:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:04:10
ROZAR (ph) And because I’ve always had fluctuating weight problem. 

01:04:15
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:04:15
ROZAR (ph) And um… and I sort of felt I needed to look a certain way… 

01:04:25
FRANK WILLS Right 

01:04:25
ROZAR (ph) …in order to… 

01:04:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:04:25
ROZAR (ph) …sort of feel like I fitted in and I didn’t feel comfortable and around I’d feel accepted in sometimes and… 

01:04:40
FRANK WILLS And tell about them, are they actually slim and good looking. 

01:04:45
ROZAR (ph) Um… not in my feeling. 

01:04:50
FRANK WILLS So that may be not very reliable. 

01:04:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, but… 

01:04:50
FRANK WILLS Some, some slightly negative feeling from… from the family. 

01:04:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… yeah. 

01:05:00
FRANK WILLS So do you think that is a factor we’ve to write down? 

01:05:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I think that was quite important. 

01:05:05
FRANK WILLS Right, yeah. 

01:05:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:05:05
FRANK WILLS yeah. 

01:05:05
ROZAR (ph) Where he was very yeah… very important actually. 

01:05:10
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

01:05:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:05:15
FRANK WILLS Now we have to be fair about this we do have to look at you as well so what do you think that you might have done that might have… 

01:05:25
ROZAR (ph) Was… 

01:05:25
FRANK WILLS …contributed to this? 

01:05:30
ROZAR (ph) I was quite suspicious. I think. 

01:05:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:05:30
ROZAR (ph) And I… you know um… and I didn’t know whether that had some impact really on, on… on things because um… and then because I was suspicious I um… I’m nagged a lot I think I’d always be what I felt like I was… my husband said it felt like I was going on all the time. 

01:06:15
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:06:15
ROZAR (ph) And, so… so may be my nagging was something that was… 

01:06:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I mean one thing… you put that down as you’re bit suspicious and nagging. I’m just conscious here of the method that I’m using which is to ask a series of questions to try and draw things out of her and one might say this is a kind of form of Socratic dialogue. 

01:06:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:06:45
FRANK WILLS Which is one of the main CBT ways of proceeding. The… the qualifying factor is the fact that I’m asking questions based on a lot of things you said to me before so they aren’t completely open ended questions and some people might argue that might be the more truly Socratic method but you know it seems a bit difficult to me to ignore the fact that you…. you’ve already raised some issues and… and sometimes a very, very open-ended Socratic question can be quite long and slow and a bit dull… 

01:07:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:07:30
FRANK WILLS …to be honest and I probably um… take a more possibly overly active approach to the questioning here but on the other hand it does fairly quickly generate ah… how… 

01:07:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah, sure. 

01:07:50
FRANK WILLS …a set of very, very considerations I think. 

01:07:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay and going on to the next clip what are we gonna see there? 

01:08:00
FRANK WILLS Well, in this next clip is well as I say we in this one generated a load of possible influence on the breakup of… of the family situation and what we’re gonna do now is we’re gonna actually slot these into the pie-chart, add slices of the pie so in other words a factor which had been very, very important will give a big slice of the pie to and um… a smaller factor we give a smaller slice of the pie to and by the way I gather that my terminology, might… might be bit old fashioned here. I’m from the north of England, we do like pies and I gather that the more hit members of the community is now referring to these as pizzas. 

01:08:50
MIKE SIMMONS Ah… hah… 

01:08:55
FRANK WILLS Ah… but in a sense although we're kind of saying we'll watch(ph) portion of the pie or pizza does this account for and it might be say a quarter or half or third or something the Maths of that really isn’t… isn’t very important. It’s obviously a very, very imprecise. 

01:09:15
MIKE SIMMONS Huh… huh… 

01:09:15
FRANK WILLS …science as it were it’s more making the points, that this probably more to this than were we begin from because when we’re distressed we probably over simply things especially we feel bad about it we… we take too much responsibility and add(ph) all sorts of other factors so it’s really the balance between things and the actual mathematical proportion doesn’t, doesn’t really matter and as long as the person beings to thing oh we can’t stop to think about this differently. 

01:09:55
MIKE SIMMONS But going back to what you’re saying earlier. It’s easy to see the importance of coming up with the list of things that are going in the pie before she actually starts to look those rough kind of divisions. 

01:10:10
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah I think so and another point I think is useful to think about is the visual impact of this which is a lot of the… the impact of this particular technique and I think, I think sometimes CBT therapist get a bit to hooked up on trying to change thoughts and… and use all this technology like thought(ph) records to do so and I often find that actually, at home when I’m working with people I also have a whiteboard and sometimes I just write a native thought down on a whiteboard and I kind of say well, just have a look at that and we kind of sit and look at it and you get very interesting reactions… 

01:10:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:10:55
FRANK WILLS …from clients you know some… and they will often say I’ve had people burst out laughing of their negative thought and things like do I really think that. 

01:11:05
MIKE SIMMONS Because they're just outside there all that way… 

01:11:05
FRANK WILLS It’s just there yeah and I think this is similar effect you know and I remember in my early stages of learning counseling actually that really big learning point was that when you reflected a clients feeling it was often the first time that they realized what they felt. 

01:11:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:11:25
FRANK WILLS So and they were in fact(ph) oh my goodness do I really feel less than that sort of moments of potential change. 

01:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. 

01:11:35
FRANK WILLS The gear, you can almost feel the gear shift and I think this is… these kind of visual things can often have an similar effect within the realm of cognition, thought and belief. 

01:11:45
MIKE SIMMONS And I’m reminded of my early days of training and that kind of anxiety to hold up the mirror to the client, the fear is that they’re gonna say (inaudible ) , yeah but actually it’s almost like they’ve never seen it. 

01:12:00
FRANK WILLS That’s right. 

01:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Until it’s outside to look back on. 

01:12:05
FRANK WILLS So it’s suddenly saying what you feel and suddenly saying what you think like in the very pathway. 

01:12:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah, yeah… okay shall we move on the next clip. 

01:12:10
FRANK WILLS Okay we got a quite few factors down there so what we’re gonna do now is give, give each one of those you know a slice of the pie as it work. 

01:12:20
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

01:12:25
FRANK WILLS So um… so that… what about the fact that the job itself he was doing meant that he does… is that in some way responsible? 

01:12:30
ROZAR (ph) I think that was quite important part. 

01:12:35
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:12:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:12:40
FRANK WILLS So how… how biggest slice do you want to give that. 

01:12:40
ROZAR (ph) Um… 

01:12:40
FRANK WILLS Bearing in mind with all these other things to fit to this as well. 

01:12:45
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. Do you want me to sort of draw it in? 

01:12:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, what just… what do you think how big the slice will be? 

01:12:55
ROZAR (ph) Um… Well, it’s not a quarter. 

01:12:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:12:55
ROZAR (ph) …quite but it could almost be a quarter. 

01:13:00
FRANK WILLS okay, it’s quite big then okay. 

01:13:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:13:00
FRANK WILLS So you want to put that in. 

01:13:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. I’m not very good at drawing. Okay. 

01:13:10
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

01:13:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:13:15
FRANK WILLS That’s fine. And it just needs to be approximate any way… 

01:13:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:13:20
FRANK WILLS …so that’s, that’s the exactly short of a quarter. 

01:13:20
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

01:13:25
FRANK WILLS You did that fine. Actually what’s the next one? 

01:13:30
ROZAR (ph) Long absences and that goes with… 

01:13:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah it’s kind of a same… 

01:13:30
ROZAR (ph) …job yeah, yeah. 

01:13:35
FRANK WILLS But also the fact that he was unpredictable. 

01:13:40
ROZAR (ph) For me that was really quite big bit. 

01:13:40
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:13:45
ROZAR (ph) Because that’s the bit I found most difficult at some times to manage. 

01:13:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:13:50
ROZAR (ph) So I think I’m gonna make the probably the same size almost. 

01:13:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:14:00
ROZAR (ph) Ah… as the other one. 

01:14:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:14:00
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… yeah. 

01:14:05
FRANK WILLS And also those the uncommunicativeness that you says is that kind of the same thing. 

01:14:10
ROZAR (ph) Um… I think that… 

01:14:15
FRANK WILLS Or is it something? 

01:14:15
ROZAR (ph) I think it's, I think I need to… I think they are separate. 

01:14:20
FRANK WILLS Right okay so you want to add a bit more for that. 

01:14:25
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

01:14:25
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:14:25
ROZAR (ph) Okay. And then… and 

01:14:30
FRANK WILLS There is money… 

01:14:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah, that… that was quite, quite big one really. 

01:14:35
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:14:35
ROZAR (ph) I could make that this big yeah. 

01:14:40
FRANK WILLS Okay. 

01:14:40
ROZAR (ph) And then… 

01:14:45
FRANK WILLS So what we've got left? 

01:14:45
ROZAR (ph) My husband’s family, their view of me. 

01:14:50
FRANK WILLS Yes, yeah, yeah. 

01:14:50
ROZAR (ph) I think that I feel that if they had a different view of me and then I might have coped better. 

01:15:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:00
ROZAR (ph) So that really was quite… 

01:15:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:15:05
ROZAR (ph) Just thinking about it and… 

01:15:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:15:10
ROZAR (ph) Maybe yeah. I could have made a difference I think. Yeah, so I think that’s quite, quite big so I’m gonna make about this. 

01:15:30
FRANK WILLS Now, now you can see what’s happened here and now can't you… 

01:15:30
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:15:35
FRANK WILLS Because I think the last two things are to do with you. 

01:15:35
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:15:40
FRANK WILLS And you know we’ve actually left… we’ve only got relatively small space left for you, most of this other stuff is not to do with you. 

01:15:45
ROZAR (ph) Not. 

01:15:50
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:15:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:15:50
FRANK WILLS So… so if we can just open this out for a moment 

01:15:55
ROZAR (ph) Right. 

01:15:55
FRANK WILLS And if you can draw a circle on the other side… and this is what when you’re feeling very upset what you’re saying was it’s all my fault. 

01:16:05
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:16:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:16:05
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… hmm… 

01:16:05
FRANK WILLS So the whole pie was down to you but now we’ve analyzed this you know a bit more sort of objectively as it where… it looks like some of it is possibly… 

01:16:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:16:20
FRANK WILLS You know but certainly not all of it and in fact pretty by our own assessment. 

01:16:25
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… hmm… 

01:16:25
FRANK WILLS you know the vast majority of factors were down to other things, other than you. And how does that seem when look at it that way…. 

01:16:35
ROZAR (ph) It’s… It’s… It feels really strange sort of looking at it this way because I never sort of… have thought about all these things, but I have not broken them down or listed them and seeing them this way makes me think that may be it was all down to me. 

01:17:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:17:05
ROZAR (ph) Even though that… sometimes the thought that I have… 

01:17:10
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:17:10
ROZAR (ph) …and… and that can be around quite a lot for me at the moment and… 

01:17:15
FRANK WILLS yes , yeah. 

01:17:20
ROZAR (ph) …and that’s why I was so down last week because I just felt that it was all my fault and I had driven my husband away but sort of feel may be yes, it’s my fault, but maybe there are other things as well. 

01:17:40
MIKE SIMMONS So any further reflections on that clip Frank? 

01:17:45
FRANK WILLS Yes, I think the thing that still I think pretty well every time I watched that session, is about the potential for manipulation in this technique and several people have raised this. And I supposedly the… the charge I might have to stand up to here is the fact that I took her elements with the things that she thought. She was doing which might have some barring. I took those last by which time you know we got… 

01:18:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:18:25
FRANK WILLS …quite a lot of the pie in. 

01:18:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah 

01:18:25
FRANK WILLS And I suppose the… the counter to that idea might be that we were trying to counteract a thought that she’d had in, she was pretty well a 100% responsible for things that were wrong. So in a way if we would've because (inaudible ) I could have done well, I could have start in such a so how let’s start with you. 

01:18:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yeah. 

01:18:50
FRANK WILLS How much responsibility that we gonna give you and she might well, she could have said 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or something. 

01:19:00
MIKE SIMMONS So in some way you're talking about manipulation, but another way here you're talking about balance because she is already putting all the loading on herself. 

01:19:10
FRANK WILLS That was… that’s right and you know the one of the understandings of CBT would be that along with the psychological problem and say in this case of depression that comes a lot of cognitive distortion with that and it is when people are depressed then much more likely to… to focus on the negative things. So if you're going to counteract that and if you going to break down the vicious cycle of depression, you have to kind of come in with some other angle on it is to… to… to trying… to trying break them that that distortion. But I think it would have been a very brave decision to ask her for her responsibility first. 

01:19:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:19:55
FRANK WILLS I almost kind of wish I could rerun and just to see what happen, but and people watching this will have their own you know that… their own opinion on that I guess. 

01:20:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:20:10
FRANK WILLS And… And the other thing is that you know some other people have observed that almost an opposite thing so that when they watched it they've said well you know isn’t it just obvious that she is not 100% responsible and… and when you just feel like screaming I say… 

01:20:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah… yeah. 

01:20:30
FRANK WILLS Come on! You know and when I don’t… don’t think, I particularly did feel, but anyway from a technical point of view it’s just really important to take the time to do it because we referred before to ah… being in two minds about things and how that is often a prelude to change. And we might bring in here the great concept of cognitive dissonance which is and the idea of cognitive dissonance is that you have two contradictory ideas, which coexist. But overtime the human mind seems to find it very difficult to tolerate that kind of ambiguity. So that it will find a new configuration of those two things. So here we have the idea that’s oh I’m really a 100% responsible. But here there are always other things which might also be in (inaudible ). And more what we are watching is these two things going to mingling and you know sort of interacting with each other. 

01:21:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

01:21:30
FRANK WILLS I think it’s really important to just give that the time to do that and you know again from a therapeutic point of view is what you want is emotionally convincing change. 

01:21:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:21:40
FRANK WILLS Because quite often you know it’s relatively easy to… to… to make a quick fix change where you say, “Oh yes I should really be doing this. I shouldn’t be doing that,” but part of you might still be really hankering after… 

01:21:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:21:55
FRANK WILLS …that pair of red shoes which you know you shouldn’t really be wearing your age or something whatever it is. 

01:22:05
MIKE SIMMONS (inaudible ) interesting (inaudible ). 

01:22:08
FRANK WILLS It’s kind of like you know it’s… it’s about giving a little time to really unfold in its own way, I think which is the essence of cognitive dissonance. And it’s really I guess letting the cognitive dissonance do the work you know, letting it not you have interfered like you’ve got to… as the therapist now. The therapist having to make this all happen, but just you know and helping the helping the… the actual dissonance, which is there to just naturally unfold in its own time. It’s likely to be much lead to much more convincing change I think in the long run. 

01:22:45
MIKE SIMMONS I’ve… I’ve just got the sense of… of the therapist role to make sure that there is two ideas are held that one doesn’t just get batted off the court immediately for that work to happen both of those ideas have got to be held… 

01:23:00
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:23:00
MIKE SIMMONS …next to each other in some way. 

01:23:05
FRANK WILLS Yes again it’s… it’s important I think in a way to honor the negative idea as it was, a sort of what you're saying to hold that as well as all the… all the you know the possible counteracting and more… more positive ideas. Because there are often good reasons why client is actually having this idea. Sometimes they can have a sort of functionality you know, for example you know if you really think you're a bad person as it were then it kind of (inaudible ) you a bit to the disappointment because if you're bad person you know you can have disappointment such a way and that’s sometimes a reason why these things are persisted in the way they do. But… But here we have a really interesting woman because if you think about the idea of being a 100% responsible, um… one of the worst things we can say about people actually is that they are irresponsible, you know. So there is something which is probably pretty functional about… about being responsible. 

01:24:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yes… yeah. 

01:24:15
FRANK WILLS You know, but it can also be overdone and that’s the discussion that we… we get into in the next clip. And it’s an instant clip because CBT is often very much associated with working with the current problems and the current symptoms. But I find that some elements of the history always comes in which is partly governed… partly covered in… in CBT by the idea of formulation and will put the formulation for this particular client in… in… 

01:24:50
MIKE SIMMONS …in the booklet. 

01:24:50
FRANK WILLS …in the booklet. So people will have access to that. Ah… but also I think it's… I think there are client… clients who sometimes do want to talk about that. You know and a… a… a… a student was asking me recently actually well what… what all the circumstances where it’s okay to talk about clients past you know and… and… and I mean that’s quite an interesting question, the motivation I mean that question is quite interesting. Is like if CBT is about saying I shall not do that and that seem come with a very good idea. 

01:25:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

01:25:30
FRANK WILLS But… But roughly I would say the… the… the answer of the question is that when the client themselves wants to talk about and and… I find that clients frequently do not always, but frequently do. So you would naturally offer this space to reflect on past experience. And sometimes the… the other alternative would be when the past keeps on making itself known as it were, it almost demands to be… 

01:26:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes… yeah. 

01:26:00
FRANK WILLS …spoken up because it… because it underlies so much of what the clients current function. Because the client always has a learning history obviously which is led up to the current problem and the current attitudes which may be related to it. But we don’t necessarily have to go down very psychoanalytic routes to actually do this. And… And here we simply spend a relatively short time just reflecting on well you know what are any of these attitudes responsible? Do they relate back to any experiences? You've had or not, I really had very little knowledge about what she went on to tell but so it’s completely new ground and the new ground is often the exciting interesting… 

01:26:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah… yeah. 

01:26:50
FRANK WILLS …thing in any… any therapy session and because it comes very late in the session we don’t have time to… to explore it very deeply in that time. But I really honestly, truly believe that what you kind of can do that, is you can say okay relax it’s really interesting, we are gonna put that up there and it will be a time when it will be an obvious to… to bring me back down and will come back and if issues are important they will always make themselves known and the bad therapist I think is the person who ploughs on regardless of what… 

01:27:30
MIKE SIMMONS Absolutely… 

01:27:30
FRANK WILLS …the process itself is trying to tell them she would be down with that kind of thing. 

01:27:30
MIKE SIMMONS Absolutely. Okay this is actually the last clip from the session that we’re going to see, shall we see that now? 

01:27:40
FRANK WILLS Yes. If don’t mind me my… me reflecting this to you. I get… I’ve got the impression from talking to you that you're pretty conscientious person. You know you are a person who does take responsibility… 

01:27:55
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

01:27:55
FRANK WILLS …for things. 

01:27:55
ROZAR (ph) I think… 

01:27:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:27:55
ROZAR (ph) …that’s… that was how I was brought up. 

01:28:00
FRANK WILLS Right yeah. I wondered about and I wondered, you know so… so it might be quite helpful for us to understand you know where that comes from as it were. What… what you think about that? Can you explain to me about those? 

01:28:10
ROZAR (ph) Well my parents were in Christian ministry so that meant that really from an early age, there is a lot expected of us and we were had lots of responsibilities and supporting my father. He used to pastor a very small church… 

01:28:35
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:28:40
ROZAR (ph) …in… in… in Yorkshire(ph) and we were had to play our part, but even in the family I’m sort of the middle child of a large family and I felt I had lots of responsibilities in terms of the my younger siblings and there were things needed to be done and I had to do them and that as always been something that’s important to me and I sort of I don’t know whether that made a difference to how I’ve was with my… my husband. 

01:29:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm… what do you think? 

01:29:25
ROZAR (ph) But… 

01:29:25
FRANK WILLS Did… Did he have a similar perspective to you? 

01:29:30
ROZAR (ph) I think on… on some levels he did, but I think what made things difficult for me was certainly in terms of the financial stuff that didn’t feel responsible. 

01:29:45
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:29:45
ROZAR (ph) And that’s why I’m used to that. 

01:29:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:29:45
ROZAR (ph) My father was always a responsible… 

01:29:50
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:29:50
ROZAR (ph) …person and… 

01:29:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:29:55
ROZAR (ph) …and I don't know I suppose they had a lot to do as well with my own, my own expectations, really that you know my husband is very different. You know he was a very different type of parenting I think that he had than… than I had. Um… but being responsible was I suppose is something that somebody like me from a faith background. 

01:30:25
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:30:25
ROZAR (ph) That… That… That’s just part and parcel… 

01:30:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:30:30
ROZAR (ph) …of… of… my upbringing. 

01:30:30
FRANK WILLS Actually it reminds a little bit of another person I worked with who was also… he was son actually of a… of a pastor and he was saying that telling to me that in a way you know it was always stress that he… he had to look that much stronger in faith and responsibilities and other people around even that was something he was found, very difficult to… 

01:30:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:30:55
FRANK WILLS …to live up to. 

01:30:55
ROZAR (ph) Yeah and I think that I think that’s true and I know that when we started having difficulties in the marriage. I… I didn’t feel that I could talk to anyone because part of being responsible is excepting the… you know you’ve got to sort this out yourself. It’s not for mum and dad to come in and… 

01:31:25
FRANK WILLS Right… yeah… yeah. 

01:31:25
ROZAR (ph) …sort it out. It was something that I was expected to do or not to go crying back to mum and dad. So, I felt I couldn’t say much to… to them because it was my responsibility to… to make things work and… and not to complain really. 

01:31:50
FRANK WILLS It’s funny as you know you’ve become, but you know you are (inaudible ) that was you talking about this. 

01:31:56
ROZAR (ph) Okay. 

01:31:56
FRANK WILLS What do you think is happening? 

01:32:00
ROZAR (ph) Um… I don’t know I just… was thinking that maybe that sense of responsibility its… maybe the one’s help me now to… to survive in a way. 

01:32:25
FRANK WILLS Yes… yeah. 

01:32:30
ROZAR (ph) Because at one point I didn’t feel that I could when things were at… at it's worse. But you know I can’t be responsible and do the things that I need to do to… to help my children and to help myself. So maybe… maybe that’s a good thing. 

01:32:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. I mean it’s certainly you know in many ways a very good quality isn’t it that to be… to be responsible. You know, but I guess like all the good qualities it can be overdone a bit. 

01:33:05
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… 

01:33:05
FRANK WILLS And one of the problem sometimes is that you know one imagines one is responsible for things that one is actually not responsible for. 

01:33:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:33:15
FRANK WILLS A bit line(ph) we found with that you know. 

01:33:15
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:33:15
FRANK WILLS But I mean I think this is an interesting area and you know when maybe we can open up a bit more might be helpful just… you know to think about how you can respond to be responsible, but at the same time you know not overdoing it to the point where you become critical of yourself. Because the other… other great Christian principle of course is forgiveness isn’t it. 

01:33:45
ROZAR (ph) Yeah. 

01:33:45
FRANK WILLS One has to be forgiving along self as well. 

01:33:50
ROZAR (ph) Hmm… Hmm. 

01:33:50
FRANK WILLS Do you think? 

01:33:50
ROZAR (ph) Yeah… Yeah, but I think it’s when you… when you feel responsible it can be difficult to ask for help. 

01:34:05
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:34:05
ROZAR (ph) And I think that’s one of things that I wish I could have done differently. 

01:34:10
FRANK WILLS Right yeah. So being responsible it doesn’t means that you can’t… you can’t ask for help and… 

01:34:20
ROZAR (ph) Um… I don’t you know my view at the time was you know being quite (inaudible ) call back to and just get in through and doing what needs to be done and not… not… sort of bleating. 

01:34:40
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:34:45
ROZAR (ph) Um… and… and I guess you know being strong really. 

01:34:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah and again you know these are all good principle in a way, but which sometimes can be overdone. I am afraid we are gonna have to so close that down for a moment, but I would see that it being very much an area to develop with you you know in future session. I want to pick up on that the comment that you made about… about holding the… the different elements of the… the clients thinking as it were. And I feel (inaudible ) by saying how there often good reasons why clients do have some of these apparently negative believes and we can see here how it was a positive signs of being responsible. 

01:35:40
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… Hmm. 

01:35:40
FRANK WILLS Rozar’s life and that it’s an important part of who she is which she doesn’t really want to lose actually. 

01:35:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:35:50
FRANK WILLS But there are still different ways of holding responsibility and… and there is still different degrees of… of holding responsibility and there are always issues about where you draw the boundaries of what you're responsible for and what other people are responsible for. And again I think we’ve opened up an interesting area though probably is an element of cognitive dissonance coming… coming again though and it’s something that I get the feeling that she is ready to run with and be very… 

01:36:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:36:25
FRANK WILLS …ready to think of again as a… as a future session. 

01:36:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. Any general thoughts about the session as a whole? 

01:36:35
FRANK WILLS Yes, well I enjoyed the session and it does give me pleasure to… to watch the way it unfolded. In general, I’m relatively pleased with the interventions I made, but there are always things that one might have done differently and it… it often strikes me about when I show the tape to… to other people and this tape and other tapes. They can’t say well maybe you could have pit up on this and that and maybe you could have said and there are just so many clinical choice in a sense you know you have to pick up someone and run with them even if they turn out to be not the… not the right one. It’s unrealistic to think you're always going to pick up the… the… the right issues as it were. But I’m interested one thing that I… I think possibly that I could, would have wanted to in retrospect to… to pick up on was the issue about asking for help, which she brings up in the end. And because it’s so fundamental to the therapy process which is itself a process of asking for help, isn’t it? 

01:37:55
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… yeah… yeah. 

01:38:00
FRANK WILLS And the fact that it was locking around makes me think that I… I maybe missed a good early opportunity to bring it up. You know, but I’m pretty at home with my phone calls… these days and it’s always interesting that to reflect you know what else might have happen like the other issue that I was thinking about if I’d ask her about her responsibility first. How that would have worked out in a sense that’s what we’re really trying to do and I hope that’s you know watching these things will encourage the people watch it to happen or some of the debate or something and how else we could do things. 

01:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS Only that I can say this or telling very reassuring for me that if we miss something and it’s important the likelihood is it’s going to come up again. 

01:38:50
FRANK WILLS Yes. 

01:38:50
MIKE SIMMONS We haven’t missed it forever. We’ve just missed picking up in that moment. Any general thoughts now as we run to the end of this DVD, CBT depression, what are the closing thoughts? 

01:39:00
FRANK WILLS Well I think I would want to hope that… that… that people will feel like I’ve got something out of this tape, which will allow them to engage with clients who are depressed. One of the things that I’ve noticed in my work as a supervisor and teacher is that there is something which can be quite scary about depression. I think it’s probably the possibility of suicide which sometimes does… does run alongside it. And sometimes people can be a big diffidence about how far they want to engage with it and perhaps thinking a little may be I want to refer this to a psychiatrist or someone… someone else. And my feeling is that the… the… the current state of research rather tells us the opposite really. That’s often is the most simple interventions which seem to be the most effective and that’s part of the impetus between the increasing access to psychological therapies and initiative that we… we seem to have good information that’s there are relatively simple interventions which can be relatively easily learned and… and implemented by… by people. So that we can allow CBT and therapy generally to get out to a wider audience because the chronic fact is at the moment that it is has not been around to do that in the past if reckoned that less than 10% of people who actually need it, actually get it. Of course that… there is the risk though that you know inherently within this project that's as well as be able to know how to implement simple techniques. A therapist undoubtedly benefits from experience and knowledge of all kinds and somehow or other we have to have a develop a way of… of putting all those things together in the services that we have, not necessarily all in the same person. So I do encourage people to… to get involved and you know not see this is something that is (inaudible ) little difficult that could never be loved. 

01:41:41
MIKE SIMMONS Okay thank you very much Frank.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communications skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills and we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas and this theory is in common without the material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. With you are trainer, a counselors, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we will have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what’ve got to offer.
