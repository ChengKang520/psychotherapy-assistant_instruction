Hobson Frank Margison Tape 1 Basic Therapeutic Skills 

00:00:00
FRANK MARGISON  This is the first tape in the series on the Conversational Model of Psychotherapy. This first tape tries to build up some basic therapeutic skills. The second tape shows how they can be joined together in the flow of therapy. In the third tape, you'll have a chance to practice some of those basic skills. Let's come back to what we mean by the term "conversation." We use the word "conversation" because we got to be focusing down on what actually happens between the therapist and patient. What they try to do is to develop a common "feeling language" so that the patient can explore further his or her feelings of conflict and painful emotions. Let's look at an example about developing "feeling language" to start with. 

00:01:20
BOB HOBSON  We're wondering if you can make a contact with what's... (crosstalk) 

00:01:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:01:25
BOB HOBSON ...going on inside? 

00:01:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:01:25
BOB HOBSON  What? Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:30
LOUISE ROGERS A clear(ph) look after? 

00:01:30
BOB HOBSON So, something, well, you don't have to keep talking... (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:01:35
BOB HOBSON ...that, whatever comes up. 

00:01:35
LOUISE ROGERS  It's be, ah, it's being loved, I don't think that it is. (crosstalk) 

00:01:40
BOB HOBSON  Yeah. 

00:01:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
BOB HOBSON Being loved? (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yes, and, uhm, yeah, being cared for. 

00:01:55
BOB HOBSON  From what you're saying, I'll link it up. Uhm, being cared for, ah, as a person. (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:05
BOB HOBSON  As you? 

00:02:10
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, no, I think, to be wonderful, I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
BOB HOBSON Yeah. Not that it would be wonderful... (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:15
BOB HOBSON ...but not also having to be cared for, say, to be part of. (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
LOUISE ROGERS  Yes. 

00:02:20
BOB HOBSON In a (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:02:21
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:21
BOB HOBSON ..all that? 

00:02:21
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:21
BOB HOBSON Hmm. But not how, this having to be wonderful... (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:25
BOB HOBSON ...and in token(ph). 

00:02:30
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:02:30
BOB HOBSON How many times when that, doesn't make you feel mad and angry? 

00:02:30
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:02:35
[sil.] 

00:02:35
LOUISE ROGERS  But I don't, I think the anger is at myself. 

00:02:45
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:02:45
LOUISE ROGERS  Beca, because I feel that there are times when I know I can say "no" to something, or should be able to say, though I just don't wanna do that or just don't, don't demand that of me because, oh God, I don't wanna give it or I can't, I haven't got the time or, but I don't. 

00:03:10
[sil.] 

00:03:10
BOB HOBSON  Do you know that's, there's such a thing you can't say? 

00:03:15
LOUISE ROGERS  Oh, yeah. 

00:03:20
BOB HOBSON I mean, suppose it was here, suppose... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:03:25
BOB HOBSON ...could, could you say now, "Shut up and stop asking me all these... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
LOUISE ROGERS  No. 

00:03:30
BOB HOBSON ...awk, awkward questions." 

00:03:30
LOUISE ROGERS No. (laughs) 

00:03:30
BOB HOBSON  Well, come have a look at that. I wonder what the theory would be. 

00:03:35
[sil.] 

00:03:35
LOUISE ROGERS  Ah, that, that would be it, but, you know, you, ah, 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:03:45
LOUISE ROGERS  in some way I'd offend you and that would be. (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
BOB HOBSON Yeah, what? 

00:03:55
LOUISE ROGERS  Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
BOB HOBSON And offend me would be, somehow, ah, I think merely hurting(ph) you? 

00:04:05
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah, yeah, it could really hurt. 

00:04:10
BOB HOBSON And then(ph) I would shut up. 

00:04:10
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:04:15
FRANK MARGISON In that example, you saw the patient and therapist trying to produce a common "feeling language." That's one of the things that we aim for in the conversational model and will come back for a number of times in this series of tapes. Now, then, we're going to start with some basic, common sense points, some basic therapeutic skills. We're going to start with the beginning of the interview and how to start. 

00:04:40
Starting the interview 

00:04:40
FRANK MARGISON  It's known from medical research that it's helpful to provide some sort of structure. What we suggest is that you introduce yourself by name and say the amount of time that's available. After that, it's helpful to make some comment about the interview situation and about how the patient feels. So, just to recap. These are the main points at the beginning of an interview. 

00:05:05
Introduction; 

00:05:05
FRANK MARGISON Introduce yourself by name. Talk about the interview situation. 

00:05:10
Time; 

00:05:10
FRANK MARGISON  And how long you have. Talk generally about the purpose of the interview. And, perhaps, get some introduction to the patient's feelings in that situation. Let's look at an example. 

00:05:25
MADDY OSBORN Hello. Hi. I'm Maddy Osborn. Come and sit down. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:35
MADDY OSBORN (inaudible ) things to make you feel, both of us, you know being here. Strange isn't it? 

00:05:45
 Hmm. 

00:05:45
MADDY OSBORN Pretty nice, isn't it? 

00:05:45
 A little bit. 

00:05:45
MADDY OSBORN Uh hmm. Uhm, what I thought we might spend the time we've got together doing is talking about the sort of things you might like to have help with or sort of things you'd like to be different, uhm, in your life and we've got about, uhm, about 45 minutes or so, it'll take us to about half past five by the, the clock. 

00:06:15
 Hmm. 

00:06:15
MADDY OSBORN Over there. 

00:06:15
 Good(ph). 

00:06:15
MADDY OSBORN  You often get to, this afternoon. (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
 This afternoon. 

00:06:20
FRANK MARGISON Here's another example of how to start an interview. 

00:06:25
LOUISE ROGERS Hello. 

00:06:25
BOB HOBSON Hello. 

00:06:25
LOUISE ROGERS Hello. 

00:06:25
BOB HOBSON  I'm Bob Hobson. 

00:06:30
LOUISE ROGERS Louise Rogers. Thank you. 

00:06:30
BOB HOBSON Have a seat. 

00:06:30
LOUISE ROGERS Okay. 

00:06:30
BOB HOBSON  You think it's a bit strange to suffer through such a situation, isn't it? 

00:06:40
LOUISE ROGERS Yes. Yes, it is. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
BOB HOBSON With the cameras and the lights and... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:06:40
BOB HOBSON  all the rest? 

00:06:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:06:45
BOB HOBSON But, uhm, we'll have a chat, and we have a clock there. 

00:06:45
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:06:50
BOB HOBSON We'll have a chat until half past six(ph), so we have 45 minutes... (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
LOUISE ROGERS Right. 

00:06:50
BOB HOBSON ...okay? 

00:06:50
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:06:50
BOB HOBSON Ah, I suppose being here, it's a bit anxious maybe? 

00:07:00
LOUISE ROGERS Yes, yes, I do feel, uhm, a bit twitchy, a bit nervy, yes. 

00:07:05
BOB HOBSON Hmm, you're sort of in your middle of something like (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:07:12
LOUISE ROGERS (laughs) Yes. And I'm amaze. (laughs) 

00:07:12
BOB HOBSON (inaudible ) 

00:07:15
LOUISE ROGERS (laughs) Yeah, always when I'm amaze, yes. 

00:07:15
BOB HOBSON  Hmm, well, maybe you can say something about the, ah, things you might like help us. 

00:07:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:07:25
BOB HOBSON Those are the things I like to know about. 

00:07:25
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:07:30
FRANK MARGISON Let me show you how to start the interview. We don't need to look at the therapist's style. When a patient comes to therapy, he or she will often have expectations about what's going to happen. One common expectation is that you're going to ask a series of direct questions. Let us look at one of the drawbacks of a direct question. Let me ask you a direct question. "How are you feeling right now?" That sort of direct question puts you really on the spot. You're expected to answer as though there's a single correct answer. 

00:08:00
Using statements 

00:08:00
FRANK MARGISON  Well, soon if you would put things in the form of a statement. "I wonder how you're feeling right now." It leaves things open. Let's look at another example of that from the therapy. 

00:08:15
  My fears aren't clear and they(ph) are sort of vague. 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:25
FRANK MARGISON  How do you think you would've handled that situation? 'Coz there's been a long silence, you might be tempted to ask a direct question like, "What are you feeling like right now?" That would come across as very intrusive. Let us look at how the therapist actually handled the situation. 

00:08:55
 My fears aren't clear and they(ph) are sort of vague. 

00:09:05
[sil.] 

00:09:05
BOB HOBSON  Ah, I, I suppose, right now, you are feeling stuck. 

00:09:20
 A bit, yes. Yeah. 

00:09:25
FRANK MARGISON The therapist's response there was in the form of a statement. He says, "I suppose, right now you're feeling stuck a bit." Let's try to summarize what the advantages are of using a statement in that situation. First of all. It suggest a starting point from which the patient can begin to develop his or her thoughts. 

00:09:45
point provokes less anxiety 

00:09:45
FRANK MARGISON Secondly, his experience is less anxiety provoking than a question. The patient will often relax and begin to speak, and finally. It's open to correction by the patient. This openness to correction is very important in this model of therapy. We call it "negotiation." Let us look at an example of "negotiation." 

00:10:10
BOB HOBSON  You use the word "panic." 

00:10:15
 Yeah, fa, fri, frightened and (sighs) so, (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:10:20
 hmm, sort of afraid and. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:25
BOB HOBSON  Uh hmm. A, a fear that something too dreadful might happen. I wonder what. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
 Well, it isn't about only that, but it doesn't, it doesn't make sense, you know, because of, in a way, nothing dreadful is gonna happen. 

00:10:45
FRANK MARGISON By "negotiation," we mean then a willingness to be corrected. That can often be expressed by using phrases like, "I wonder," or "I guess." In the example you've just seen, it was also shown by the tone of the therapist's voice. He showed a certain tentativeness. Let's take a look at the example again with that in mind. 

00:11:05
  Sort of afraid, and. 

00:11:10
BOB HOBSON Uh hmm. A, a fear that something too dreadful might happen. I wonder why. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
 Well, it isn't about only that but it doesn't, it doesn't make sense, you know, because of, in a way, nothing dreadful is gonna happen. 

00:11:30
FRANK MARGISON In this example, the therapist is trying to understand what the patient is saying about choosing. Note the way the therapist is very tentative in what he says. Look at the example. 

00:11:40
 Even if it's, it just feels very, it doesn't feel like I might choose the right thing, you know? 

00:11:50
BOB HOBSON Uh-huh. 

00:11:50
 Feels like, uhm, I mean you're just choosing, "Is it the right thing?" 

00:11:55
BOB HOBSON  Hmm, but, uhm, in choosing something, then I, I, I'm not sure about this, I'm not sure I get it quite right, but choosing something is a, is more a sense of feeling you are re, responsible, you, you have done this and that's what seem scary. 

00:12:20
 I don't know if it does. 

00:12:20
BOB HOBSON No, that's not quite right, is it? 

00:12:25
 No, not really, because I don't, I hate, it doesn't feel like that, I mean, the responsibility to choose that. I'm not feeling, I'm scared about that. 

00:12:40
FRANK MARGISON So, the process of negotiation involves the therapist in being tentative and being open to correction. You might also have noticed in these examples that the therapist uses the words, "I" and "we." That's important because it shows that the therapist is involved in the exploration. Let's take a look at another example of that. 

00:13:00
FRANK MARGISON There isn't much of a time to have a babble(ph). We're supposed to stop after ten minutes and we really talked a lot about how you feel generally and, I always get the feeling that you're getting more and more into a panic when we, we talk about the things that have happened to you. I'm not really quite sure where we are going. 

00:13:20
 Yeah. 

00:13:20
FRANK MARGISON And then the panic of that accident as well? 

00:13:20
 Thank you. It feels uncomfortable talking about it. 

00:13:25
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:13:25
FRANK MARGISON Another point about therapy style is what something called "the here and now." That's a rather old phrase. What it implies is that when you're exploring feelings with a patient, you try to bring the feelings actually into the present in the session. That's true even when you're actually talking about things that occurred in the past. 

00:13:45
Focusing on feelings in the here and now 

00:13:45
FRANK MARGISON  Look at it in two ways. First of all, the therapist often uses the words, "here" and "now," but also, the therapist asks the patient to focus actively on feelings. Let's look at an example. 

00:14:00
  To, it's the, today, a bit different... (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

00:14:10
 ...really. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:14:10
 Because today it's sort of a, more unexpected, being, (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:14:15
 not knowing what. 

00:14:15
FRANK MARGISON Yes, it's not the sort of humdrum. 

00:14:15
  No, (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:14:20
 no. 

00:14:20
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. Just, just sitting here you, you, you seem really quiet, sort of wound up and is, is there something there behind all of these? And if you can get the old love(ph) feeling, how, how it feels to you? 

00:14:30
FRANK MARGISON  In the next example, the patient says that she feels far away. The therapist suggests that she might feel that now with him. 

00:14:40
  I feel a bit, sort of far away sometimes. 

00:14:45
BOB HOBSON  Yeah. I wonder if you, you're feeling a bit far away now. 

00:15:00
 Uh hmm, a bit. 

00:15:05
[sil.] 

00:15:05
  I suppose it's one way of staying calm. Hmm. 

00:15:15
FRANK MARGISON The next example similarly tries to stick in the present. The therapist tries to get her to stay with the feelings. 

00:15:20
  I suppose I started to drink and to try and obliterate some of the, some of the feelings that I have got on my mind. And, uhm, and I suppose that's how it started, but it really got out of control, ah, over the last few months, really. 

00:15:40
SHIRLEY SEATON Hmm. Could we just... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
 Hmm. 

00:15:40
SHIRLEY SEATON ...look at the feelings that you say you have when you're alone. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:45
SHIRLEY SEATON  About to try... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
 Hmm. 

00:15:50
SHIRLEY SEATON ...tell me about how that feel. 

00:15:55
 Uhm, well I feel, lonely. 

00:16:00
FRANK MARGISON  In the last example in this section, you'll notice that the therapist asked the patient to stay with the experience she has with her mother. 

00:16:10
  No, one thing I know I'm stopping is that I know I could be close to my mother. And I know she want me to be close to her. I just can't cope with that. 

00:16:20
BOB HOBSON  And we'd touch on that, I wonder whether we can... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
 Hmm. 

00:16:25
BOB HOBSON ...just, uhm, stay over here and go over with that now though. Uhm, what sort of feelings you have when you're with your mom? In a way you want to be close, though? 

00:16:35
  Well, (laughs) it's funny 'coz, I, you know, I said the word "need" before and I just feel she's so needing and that. 

00:16:45
FRANK MARGISON So far, we've been dealing with aspects of the therapist's style. Let's try to summarize the points made so far. We started with how to begin an interview. 

00:16:55
Starting the interview 

00:16:55
FRANK MARGISON We then moved on to the use of statements rather than using a direct question. We talked about negotiation and, and negotiating style and the use of words like "I" and "we" to indicate the therapist's involvement. We talked about focusing on feelings and keeping in the "here" and "now." In the next section, we're gonna do something quite different. We're going to deal with cues. 

00:17:20
Picking up cues 

00:17:20
FRANK MARGISON  We divide the cues up into three sections. Verbal cues which deal with the content of what the patient says. Vocal cues, which deals with the patient's tone of voice, and non-verbal cues which deal with all of the areas of non-verbal behavior like posture- 

00:17:45
[movements, facial expression] 

00:17:45
FRANK MARGISON - and eye contact. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:45
FRANK MARGISON  Let's start with an example of a verbal cue. 

00:17:55
LOUISE ROGERS This got farther (laughs) than I was trying to think and I just got a big blank there, you know. 

00:18:00
BOB HOBSON Yeah. Well, well, let's stop a minute. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
BOB HOBSON All right. Yeah. 

00:18:05
FRANK MARGISON In the last example, one possible verbal cue might have been "I've got a big blank." In the next example, the same cue is repeated a number of times about leaving things to chance. 

00:18:15
 Yes, I, I mean that, so, so, what I do, sort of think, ah, I'll leave it to chance or I don't make it, the decision till it's... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
 What? 

00:18:25
 ...too late, which is the same thing. It's just, so... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
 Hmm. 

00:18:30
 ...really, to chance. And then there are things about, got to leave to chance but you can't. I mean, you can't. You can choose to apply for a job but you can't choose to get it. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
 Yeah. Things like that. And those things really infuriate me. 

00:18:40
  Hmm. 

00:18:45
FRANK MARGISON In the next example, the patient uses a long, narrative account about her experience. Then she uses a word which might imply something about the way she feels about it. 

00:18:55
 Because this is school holidays, and, ah, the children had, way out on vary, doing their own various... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:19:05
 ...bits and pieces. And we'd arranged to go out for a meal in the evening. And, ah, I've sort of been out in the afternoon and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:19:20
 ...organize the tea ah, and everything. And that they'd come, the two of them would come back and that they were eating. And then, Paul, the eldest, he'd run in to say that he couldn't make... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:19:30
 ...the tea, so, I could, ah, go and collect him... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
FRANK MARGISON Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
 ...and just sort of, I don't know, the day just seemed to shatter from there. 

00:19:40
FRANK MARGISON  Notice how she used the word "shatter." It's something quite helpful to tune in to words that are(ph), seem vivid and express feelings. Look at the end of that example again and see how the therapist actually picks that up and gets her to stay with the feelings. 

00:19:55
  I don't know, the day just seemed to shatter from there. 

00:20:00
FRANK MARGISON It just did... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
 It just. (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
FRANK MARGISON  broke up. 

00:20:05
 Yeah, yes. 

00:20:05
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:20:05
 And it, it was so, so trivial, really... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
FRANK MARGISON Come home. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
 ...that I couldn't cope with that sort of disruption and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. Come here. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
 ...and then. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
FRANK MARGISON Let's get back into what it felt like at that time. I am just thinking but you're actually there now. 

00:20:15
FRANK MARGISON  Let's move on now to vocal cues. Here's the first example. Listen out for the tone of the patient's voice. 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:30
  Hmm, what, what am I going to do? How am I going to get, I mean I just, I just can't see any end to, I can't see a way out of it at the moment. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:40
  I mean the winter's coming and, uhm, everything's an extra effort and it's cold. 

00:20:55
FRANK MARGISON  Did you notice in the last example that the patient sounded anxious? The next example's slightly more straightforward. The patient's voice is very dead and emotionless. 

00:21:10
 Perhaps, you know, it just sort of don't feel I'm getting anywhere. And we've had lots of time, but I don't feel I'm getting anywhere. And that gets me sort of getting frightened(ph). 

00:21:25
 Hmm. 

00:21:25
FRANK MARGISON  In the last example, the patient's voice was very flat. We're now gonna show the same patient twice again. In the first example, her voice sounds upset. In the next example, it sounds rather angry as well as upset. 

00:21:45
 Well it was really, couldn't let myself stop, planning. Yeah. You connect the dates, see (inaudible ) next year and the future will be (inaudible ) and then you haven't got any reason to do that. 

00:22:00
  Hmm. 

00:22:05
 The thing that came to my mind is that, "You know why other people got brothers and sisters and I haven't got brothers and sisters, and that doesn't seem fair either." 

00:22:15
 No. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
 That's crazy, you know. 

00:22:20
FRANK MARGISON Those are vocal cues. Let's look now at non-verbal cues. Here's an example of a non-verbal cue. 

00:22:30
BOB HOBSON We, you're just wondering about whether you could share those with me here and just how safe it is. 

00:22:40
LOUISE ROGERS  Hmm. I think that, I think that the tension's blocking. I just can't find (laughs) it and I was trying to think. 

00:22:50
FRANK MARGISON  In this example, the patient talked about being blocked. Note how her non-verbal gestures supported that idea. Look at the example again and look at her gestures. 

00:23:05
LOUISE ROGERS  I think that, I think that the tension's blocking. I just can't find (laughs) it and I was trying to think about. 

00:23:15
FRANK MARGISON In the next example, note how the patient avoids eye contact throughout, apart from one point where she uses the word "overtures." It may be that looking him(ph) at that point indicates that she's trying to get through to the therapist. 

00:23:25
MADDY OSBORN  Somehow it feels as if you haven't got, looking forward to it anymore... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
  Well. 

00:23:35
MADDY OSBORN ...on what you see. 

00:23:35
 I suppose that there, they've always, (sigh) they always say that there, I could ring them anytime but they don't make the overtures to come to me. So, I'm bothered. 

00:23:50
FRANK MARGISON  In the next example, note how the patient says, "I'm not saying you got anything wrong." However, his non-verbal gestures and his smile is somewhat dismissive, almost contemptuous of the therapist. 

00:24:05
 You seem to assume that I think I'm in need of help. 

00:24:10
MADDY OSBORN  Yeah, I suppose I was making that sort of assumption. Sounds if I might have got it wrong. 

00:24:20
  Well, you might, I'm not saying you got anything wrong. 

00:24:25
FRANK MARGISON  We've just been dealing with cues. That's the sort of thing that the therapist is sensitive to, to give some understanding about how the patient is feeling. A therapist also needs to communicate that understanding to the patient. That brings us onto the next section. In the next section, we're going to deal with what we call hypotheses. We break these down into three groups. The first we call "Understanding hypotheses." The second "Linking hypotheses," and the third "Explanatory hypotheses. Let's start off with understanding hypotheses. What we mean by that is a statement by the therapist which makes some sort of guess about how the patient is feeling. It tends to be phrased in the same way as we talked about in the earlier stage of this tape. Either that it's in the form of a statement, it's tentative, and it's open to correction. However, it goes beyond what the patient says. It goes beyond just a mere restatement. It tries to make some sort of guess about how the patient's feeling. Let's look at an example of that. 

00:25:40
  I know I get upset and, and I get very weepy and, but I'm able to be, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SHIRLEY SEATON I see. 

00:25:55
 When I feel this(ph), (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SHIRLEY SEATON Yes. 

00:25:55
  I feel relieved in a way. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
SHIRLEY SEATON Yeah. 

00:26:00
 And. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:00
SHIRLEY SEATON  It sounds as if though you've been bottling up... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
  Hmm. 

00:26:10
SHIRLEY SEATON ...about your feelings about... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
 Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
SHIRLEY SEATON ...the loss of John and the hurt and, uhm, the feeling somehow not being good enough or complete enough. 

00:26:25
 Hmm. Complete. Hmm. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
  Well, I have. And that I just don't know, I just don't know any way in getting it out. 

00:26:45
FRANK MARGISON Note in the last example, how the therapist guesses about the patient feeling bottled up. Note also that the patient's cues confirm that view. In the next example, you're going to see the therapist making a guess about the patient's difficulty in trust. 

00:27:00
FRANK MARGISON  It's a bit, ah, a bit risky to be here talking, talking with somebody you hardly know. 

00:27:10
  Uh-huh. Well, I wonder how far it's going to go. Here, today and also what it will lead to. 

00:27:25
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:27:25
 I mean, it's, it's risky in the sense that I don't really know what it's all about. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:27:30
 And what the result will be. 

00:27:30
FRANK MARGISON  And I guess it's a bit difficult to trust me. 

00:27:35
 Well, it's hard really I don't know you. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:27:35
FRANK MARGISON  So, we've just been dealing with understanding hypotheses. They're very important in this model of psychotherapy. They allow us to get closer to the patient's experience by making a guess about how the patient is feeling. Sometimes, they ought to go further than that. You ought to make a link with the patient's feelings in the present with feelings either in the past or in relationships outside therapy. That's where we use a linking hypotheses. Let's look at an example of a linking hypotheses. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:15
BOB HOBSON  Could be the only one, I suppose your parents had to pick to the great deal here and they want it too. 

00:28:20
 Well they, ah, they said things like they only want me to be happy and so, ah, but, yeah, like I said I really wanted to please them. I want to do... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
 Hmm. 

00:28:40
 ...well and please them achieve things. 

00:28:40
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. See, I think perhaps early on, you ah, were (sigh) wondering about what was expected of you here and then you went to them and say. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
BOB HOBSON You done some, am I right? (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
 That's right. 

00:29:00
BOB HOBSON  You, you know I, I am and perhaps you wouldn't meet, meet their expectations of you. 

00:29:10
 That's right. 

00:29:10
FRANK MARGISON In the last example, the therapist makes a link with her feelings outside with feelings in the session about his expectations. In the next example, as, as a similar sort of link, the therapist and patient try to make sense of her feeling of being aimless in the session. It makes a link to that effect. 

00:29:30
 And you asked out something that we were able to stop going then. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:29:35
 This is same in the house you know and just sort of sitting in the house. So things they doing and I don't you know, (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
 ...don't really get along. 

00:29:45
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. I just wanna hear that, doesn't being in here really I just wonder if you maybe feels a bit angst in here as well. 

00:29:55
  Well, you know that things aren't really going, what we were going you know, what, what's going on here. 

00:30:05
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:30:05
 Hmm. 

00:30:05
FRANK MARGISON  So far, we dealt with two sorts of hypotheses. We dealt with understanding hypotheses, which are our attempt to make a, a guess about how the patient is feeling. A linking hypotheses goes a stage further than that, it makes a link between way the patient's feeling now and feelings outside the therapy situation with either the past or with relationships outside. Neither those two included the cause element. For those, we use explanatory hypotheses. An explanatory hypotheses tries to make some sort of meaning sense out of the patient's feelings. The therapist is trying to make some sort of explanation. That's a rather complex concept. Let's, take a look an example to start with. 

00:31:00
LOUISE ROGERS I think I should fit my feelings to what he's feelings now. 

00:31:05
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:31:05
LOUISE ROGERS Like I did before, like I said, "Yeah, okay, I accept it. That's the way you've done it. I accept it and I didn't accept it at all. 

00:31:15
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:31:15
LOUISE ROGERS  And I think I get to my, my, and my feelings get confused with the other person's feelings, I can't sort out what I'm feeling, what they feel. (inaudible ) It's a maze, a maze. It just ah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:26
BOB HOBSON  All, all the mixed. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:30
BOB HOBSON Hmm. This, this, this seems to make one of the, scaring things sometimes about you're heading close. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
LOUISE ROGERS Right(ph). 

00:31:40
BOB HOBSON I mean do you know, only know which is the other person... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:31:45
BOB HOBSON ...who watches you. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:31:45
BOB HOBSON And, and also... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:31:45
BOB HOBSON ...of course, you, you can have in behalf. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:31:50
BOB HOBSON  It can be, be really scary. 

00:31:55
LOUISE ROGERS Uh-huh. 

00:31:55
BOB HOBSON  And it does scare a little bit. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:05
LOUISE ROGERS  I don't know what to do with the hurt. That's why, ah, ah, it, it just seems to be there, you know. 

00:32:15
BOB HOBSON  Yeah. 

00:32:20
LOUISE ROGERS How the, then I just keep wanting to run away and I'm thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
BOB HOBSON Hmm. And so. 

00:32:25
LOUISE ROGERS If I, if I run away from the situation and go with it, it's the hurt(ph) in me. 

00:32:30
BOB HOBSON Uhm, and so you ran away and you cut yourself off. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, and I still do. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
BOB HOBSON And then you feel all awful inside. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:32:40
BOB HOBSON Really(ph), actually, it could be very lonely too... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:32:45
BOB HOBSON ...to do so. 

00:32:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, very lonely. The first time in ages I felt very, just alone. That's all and disinterested, disinterested from lots of things. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
BOB HOBSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:32:55
FRANK MARGISON That was a complicated example of an explanatory hypotheses. Let's just try and break down what was involved there. The patient saying that she has difficulty sometimes because her feelings seem to be confused or mashed in with the other person's. The therapist takes it a stage further. He starts to look at a particular sort of conflict and sometimes called approach-avoidance conflict. Sometimes, the patient wants to get very close and feels that the feelings blend in with the other and then sometimes runs away, the defense against hurt. Let's look at that example again with those points in mind. 

00:33:30
LOUISE ROGERS  Ah, I think I get to my, my, and my feelings get confused with the other person's feelings, I can't sort out what I feel and what they feel really. It's a maze, a maze. it's just all. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
BOB HOBSON All, all the mixed. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:50
BOB HOBSON This, this, this seems to make the one of the, scaring things sometimes about you heading(ph) close. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
BOB HOBSON I mean do you know, only know which is the other person... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:34:00
BOB HOBSON ...and which is you. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:34:05
BOB HOBSON And, and also... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:34:05
BOB HOBSON ...of course, you can have on behalf. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
LOUISE ROGERS  Yeah. 

00:34:10
BOB HOBSON  It can be really scary, huh? (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
BOB HOBSON  And it does scare a little bit. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:25
LOUISE ROGERS  I don't know what to do with the hurt, that's why. Ah, it, it just seems to be there, you know. 

00:34:35
BOB HOBSON Yeah. 

00:34:35
LOUISE ROGERS How the, then I just keep wanting to run away and not thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. So. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
LOUISE ROGERS If I, if I run away from the situation and go with, its the hurt in me. 

00:34:50
BOB HOBSON Uhm. And so you ran away and you cut yourself off. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah and I still do. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
BOB HOBSON And then you, you'll feel all awful inside. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

00:34:55
FRANK MARGISON  The feelings involved in that explanatory hypotheses were quite complicated. If you think about it, the patient's saying that if people get too close, she might feel engulfed. On the other hand, her response to that is sometimes to run away and then she feels very cut off and alone. That's a sort of explanation that might be given why explanatory hypotheses is not strictly a causal explanation. It gives some sort of meaning to the patient's experience. That's very important and it linked into the next section, which is about metaphor. A metaphor is used in every day language as a way of fusing together two different experiences to give a, a new sense of meaning. In psychotherapy, we try to use something very similar that's a good example to start with. 

00:35:50
 When I get at least of the things to start with a person a little bit you know... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
FRANK MARGISON Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
 ...because often that's when I, I'm on my own. So ah, I mean at work you know in, in between in doing something that's in my mind. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

00:36:00
  You know in the house, I suppose I'm gonna fool around. 

00:36:05
FRANK MARGISON It sounds like you intentionally feels almost like there's sort of barrier of a shell somewhere, almost like a sort of eggshell. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
 Worse(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
FRANK MARGISON Brittle and(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
 And(ph) somebody said I was always a bit withdrawn but. 

00:36:15
FRANK MARGISON  In the last example, the therapist used a quite simple metaphor about eggshell and her feeling brittle. The next example is a bit more complicated. The patient's been talking about her experience of sadness. The therapist wants to get across the idea that she feels full of sadness, he uses a metaphor a deep well of sadness. 

00:36:40
LOUISE ROGERS  I miss there were a thing, I(ph) tell, you know go home you know if anything happen(ph). 

00:36:50
[sil.] 

00:36:50
BOB HOBSON  I get the feeling of uhm, sadness, sort of a deep well of sadness. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:05
BOB HOBSON  Much of it. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:15
FRANK MARGISON  That last example of metaphor was an attempt to try to understand something about the patient's world, about her feelings. In this next example, the therapist is trying to make some sort of statement about how it feels like to be in an interview with this particular man. She uses two metaphors at different points in the interview which we're going to show together now. The first time, she tries to make sense of his experience by using the metaphor being in a canning factory. He was being canned and processed. Later on she uses the metaphor about him being in a conveyor belt, which is the way that he is feeling at that point or at least the way she imagine he's feeling. 

00:38:00
 So, you know I'm just going through like a process, being put in various places as far as I can say. This happens to be all I just want. 

00:38:10
MADDY OSBORN Sort of like a canning factory or something? 

00:38:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
MADDY OSBORN  Now I do know a bit about you already and then, and if got into trouble. I know you feel pushed around, and then you see somebody before me. Aren't you feeling pretty fed up with it. And I also get the feeling that you're feeling a bit like a sort of, a canning, canning factory going on, some sort of conveyor belt. So, I'll tell you a bit. 

00:38:50
FRANK MARGISON  So far in this tape we've dealt with some general issues about the therapist's style. We moved on to look at the cues that are there in the interview, and then to some specific interventions that the therapist might make, to make some sort of sense about what's going on. To end this tape, we're going to look at how you might end the first initial assessment interview. What usually ends by the formation of the therapeutic contract? 

00:39:20
Making a contract 

00:39:20
FRANK MARGISON In a therapeutic contract you need to cover two areas. First of all the practicalities,- 

00:39:25
Contract - Future sessions 

00:39:25
FRANK MARGISON  -about how often you're going to meet. How long your sessions' going to be. And how many sessions are there going to be all together? You also need to make some general statement of aims. And about the wide(ph) and(ph) focus of therapy. This might involve you in summarizing what's gone on so far in that session. Let's look at an example of forming a therapeutic contract. 

00:39:50
FRANK MARGISON  We've been talking for uhm, about three quarters of an hour now, (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
 Hmm. 

00:40:00
FRANK MARGISON and I think that seems the most important we've talked about is when we, when we talked a bit about just after your mom died, and how you felt... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
 Hmm. 

00:40:05
FRANK MARGISON  left on your own. Uhm, I think you said abandoned. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
 Yeah. 

00:40:15
FRANK MARGISON Ah, I got the feeling awhile before that you were a bit scared of what might happen in here, that you might somehow left high and dry. What I was thinking that might be helpful is, if we could fix some definite times to meet, perhaps every week for the next six weeks for about the same time as we've had today, about three quarters of an hour. And then, you know, I understood from you, from that, and then we could see around end about six weeks. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
  So, I could see you regularly, you know. 

00:40:45
FRANK MARGISON Well, I think if we, if we fix that six sessions, (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
FRANK MARGISON then we know where we are by that... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
FRANK MARGISON ...we can take it from there at the end and talk over where we want to go from there. And maybe we could focus a bit on, on those feelings we've talked about today, about how you get scared that people might just leave you high and dry and leave you feeling abandoned. And I don't know how you feel about that. 

00:41:15
 Well, I was a bit worried that, you know, just today would be the end and... (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:41:20
 ...you know it, it might be worse than... (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

00:41:20
  it was before. So I think I'd rather, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
 ...know what I was going to do. 

00:41:30
FRANK MARGISON Let's summarize what this tape has shown. We start with how to begin an interview and therapist style, went on to deal with cues, went to about some specific interventions in the form of hypotheses and ended with the formation of a therapeutic contract. In tape two, you'll see how these various basic therapeutic skills can be joined together and you can see the flow of therapy. 

00:41:55
The patients were played by Nettie Bevan; Paddy Crossling; Sue Fairbairn; Pam Grossick; Simon Naji; Louise Rogers; and Kath Wilkinson. The therapist were Shirley Seaton; Maddy Osborn; Frank Margison; and Bob Hobson. The presenter was Frank Margison This series was supported by a grant from the NWRHA.

00:41:55
FRANK MARGISON  This is the second tape in the series on, "A Conversational Model of Psychotherapy." In the last tape we shared a series of isolated examples. In this tape we're going to show a longer extract from the first interview. From time to time, the tape would be stopped and I will comment on the process of therapy. We'll then rerun the last section of interview with caption subtitles commenting on what's going on. We join the interview at the beginning. Notice how the therapist focuses on the interview situation and the patient's feelings. 

00:43:15
BOB HOBSON  Well this is strange situation, isn't this? 

00:43:20
 Yes, yeah. 

00:43:25
BOB HOBSON With the, with the lights? 

00:43:25
 Very (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
BOB HOBSON (inaudible ). 

00:43:31
 Very clear. Uh-huh. 

00:43:31
BOB HOBSON  I'm(ph) seeing that you are blaming me. 

00:43:35
 (laughs) Hmm. I was just saying(ph) to you... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:43:40
 ...what was gonna happen. 

00:43:45
BOB HOBSON Yeah, but I wonder I suppose you are feeling a bit anxious about it all and that's good I presume(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
 Uh hmm, I'm uncomfortable really. 

00:43:55
BOB HOBSON  Well, I wonder whether you could say something about the, uhm, some of the things you'd like help about most. 

00:44:05
  Well, it's really about this sort of states I get in and I, I just can't do anything, you know and I know these things to do, like in the house, you know, I might be ironing or something or, or at work. And I've decided these things to do and I just, you know, I just sit and I, I just can't seem to get along with anything. 

00:44:30
BOB HOBSON  I wonder whether its anxiety, it, it's as if something seems to hold you up? 

00:44:40
 Yeah, it's kinda bit, yes. 

00:44:45
FRANK MARGISON In that section, the therapist was acknowledging her feelings about how she felt in the session. He starts right off from the beginning asking her how she's feeling there and then. She acknowledges, she says, "I feel a bit uncomfortable really." And he, he responds by asking her what she like help with there and then? She responds by describing, "Not being able to get on with things." At the end of that section, she half-agrees with the comment the therapist makes. Note how the therapist handles that. 

00:45:15
BOB HOBSON I wonder whether its anxiety, it, it's as if something seems to hold you up? 

00:45:20
 Yeah, it's kinda bit, yes, I just sort of kind of. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
BOB HOBSON Kind of? That's not quite right. 

00:45:30
 I don't know quite which way to turn, you know, it seem to not settle to thing. 

00:45:35
BOB HOBSON  And that you can't, uhm, settle to any one thing? 

00:45:45
 Yes. 

00:45:45
BOB HOBSON  Uhm, may, maybe it's a bit like the, lots of things you've, ah, you don't know which to fix on and you turn one, you're turn to another(ph)? 

00:45:55
 But I don't even really try, (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
 Hmm. 

00:46:00
 you know I just, I just sort of, I just sort of sit still but I know I should be doing something and, you know, ah, I just, ah, just can't understand. 

00:46:15
BOB HOBSON I'm, I'd like to hear a bit more about that you, it seems as if you can't move? 

00:46:20
  Yeah, that's, that's just about it really. Listen, I, I know what things should be done, I should be doing. I'm not gonna think about them, but I just can't go with doing them. 

00:46:35
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:46:35
  And you know, I wake up early and just think about things and that doesn't really help, anyone with anything. 

00:46:50
BOB HOBSON Hmm. I'd like to get more feeling with this (sigh) and I wonder whether you can imagine that sort of a, happening now. 

00:47:00
  Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
BOB HOBSON As if you are sitting there. 

00:47:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
BOB HOBSON I think perhaps the, there's a bit of it now, actually. (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
 There is a bit, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
BOB HOBSON Uh hmm. You, you are not quite sure how, (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
BOB HOBSON uh hmm, what you, who got you, what you should you do here with me? 

00:47:15
 Yeah. 

00:47:15
FRANK MARGISON So the therapist there is picking up her uncertainty and acknowledging it. He says, "No, not quite right." He asked her to imagine things happening now and to make links with the present. The next step is very important. Even though it's very early in the interview, the therapist is making a link with her uncertainty outside with the feeling of uncertainty in the session. He says, "There's a bit here now, I think." All of these is still very tentative. The therapist is working towards a grasp of her feelings. Watch this brief extract again with the captions commenting on what's going on. 

00:47:55
  And I just, ah, I just can't understand it. 

00:48:00
Understanding hypothesis 

00:48:00
BOB HOBSON  Ah, I'd like to hear a bit more about that. You, seems as if you can't move? 

00:48:10
 Yeah, that's, that's just about it, really. Listen, ah, I know what things should be done, I should be doing. I'm not gonna think about them but I just can't go with doing them. 

00:48:25
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:48:25
  And you know, I wake up early and just think about things and that doesn't really help anyone with anything. 

00:48:35
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:48:40
Focus 

00:48:40
BOB HOBSON I'd like to get more feeling of this (sigh) and I wonder whether you can imagine that sort of a, happening now? 

00:48:50
 Uh-huh. 

00:48:50
BOB HOBSON As if you are sitting there. 

00:48:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
BOB HOBSON I think perhaps that- 

00:48:55
Here and now 

00:48:55
BOB HOBSON - there's a bit of it now, actually. 

00:48:55
 There is a bit, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
BOB HOBSON  You, You, You're not quite sure, (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
 Hmm. 

00:49:00
BOB HOBSON what you, who got you- 

00:49:00
Linking hypothesis 

00:49:00
BOB HOBSON - what you should do here with me? 

00:49:05
 No, I don't know. I don't know what, what any of these are for. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:10
BOB HOBSON  Well, could you- 

00:49:15
Focus 

00:49:15
BOB HOBSON - just say, ah, ah, something more about that feeling as if it's happening now, which it is a bit? 

00:49:25
  Ah, I feel a bit sort of stuck and panicky at the same time, and yet, you know, I, I just don't seem to have any, any push to get anything done. 

00:49:40
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:49:45
 But, but I want to. 

00:49:45
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. Is, is this "stuckness" not being able to move ah, but also, feeling really scared? 

00:50:00
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:50:00
FRANK MARGISON  The next section the therapist continues to explore her feelings of uncertainty as they occur in this session. The guest goes beyond on what she's actually saying, he makes the suggestion, "I guess you feel a little scared." Then goes on to talk about feelings of panic based on the cue she gives him. Let's look at that section again and just pick-up what the therapist is doing now. 

00:50:25
Cue 

00:50:25
  I feel a bit sort of stuck and panicky at the same time. And yet, you know, I, I just don't seem to have any, any push to get anything done. 

00:50:40
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:50:45
 But, but I want to. 

00:50:45
BOB HOBSON Hmm. Is, is this "stuckness"- 

00:50:50
Picks up cue 

00:50:50
BOB HOBSON  -not being able to move ah, but also feeling- 

00:51:00
Understanding hypothesis 

00:51:00
BOB HOBSON - really scared? 

00:51:00
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:51:00
BOB HOBSON  It's beyond- 

00:51:05
Uses statement 

00:51:05
BOB HOBSON - being scared but? You... (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
 Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
BOB HOBSON ...used the word panic. 

00:51:05
  Yeah, I feel a bit frightened now. (sigh) 

00:51:15
BOB HOBSON Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
 Hmm. I'm so afraid right now. 

00:51:20
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:51:25
Negotiation 

00:51:25
BOB HOBSON Ah, I feel that something dreadful might happen. I wonder what. (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
 Well, it is about right now, but it doesn't, doesn't make sense, you know, because, you know, in a way nothing dreadful is gonna happen, you know, sort of these, with things about the house, I know nothing dreadful was gonna happen, if I didn't get anything(ph) done. It's, you know, I just sort of don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. You know, I've got lots of time but I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere, I'm not getting myself making something(ph). 

00:52:00
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. Hmm, you're frightened inside? 

00:52:05
Picks up cue 

00:52:05
  Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
BOB HOBSON Could you say- 

00:52:10
Focus 

00:52:10
BOB HOBSON - I wonder where, where you feel that fear? Where do you feel the fear? 

00:52:15
 Hmm. Well, in here (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:52:21
BOB HOBSON Something about, something about that. (crosstalk) 

00:52:21
 Uh hmm. 

00:52:21
BOB HOBSON Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:21
  Most of the time, uhm. 

00:52:25
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. I know, ah, you, uhm, you, you said that, that you're wondering what this was all about in here. 

00:52:35
 Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
BOB HOBSON Uhm, well, ah, first I would like to ah, say how we(ph) can help you. 

00:52:45
 Hmm. 

00:52:45
BOB HOBSON I, I'll help you with this being stuck on your fears, all right? Ah, but that means understanding some of the other things that are going on in you, you know? 

00:53:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:53:00
BOB HOBSON And also in you when you're with these people. A, and if you're gone, in you here being able to get into touch with them all. 

00:53:10
  Hmm. 

00:53:15
[sil.] 

00:53:15
 It sounds like a good idea, if it's possible. 

00:53:20
BOB HOBSON Right, well now, I wonder whether- 

00:53:25
Focus - here and now 

00:53:25
BOB HOBSON - you could stay (sigh) with these, these feelings in you now, the being stuck, and the, ah, fear? 

00:53:40
[sil.] 

00:53:40
  It all just seems all empty, you know. Time goes on, you know, and the future itself(ph) goes on and- 

00:53:55
Cue 

00:53:55
 - it just all seems sort of empty. 

00:53:55
[sil.] 

00:53:55
BOB HOBSON  An emptiness- 

00:54:05
Picks up cue 

00:54:05
BOB HOBSON - as if there's nothing there? 

00:54:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
BOB HOBSON  And maybe, ah,- 

00:54:10
Understanding hypothesis 

00:54:10
BOB HOBSON - I'm not sure but maybe, uhm, almost in, in your own now? 

00:54:15
  Uh hmm, I, I, I, yes. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:25
  Uhm, you know, maybe that I'm not such of, with other people or actually with the things that I wanted to do. 

00:54:35
FRANK MARGISON  So that's the end of this first section we want to look at. Let's just recap on what the therapist done. He starts off the interview by talking about the place, the situation and her feelings about that. He then goes on and starts to make a series of guesses about how she's feeling, it links in her feelings of uncertainty outside with her uncertainty of the session. He goes on to talk about her feelings of being scared inside and feelings of panic. Now, there are number of things that the therapist hasn't picked up at this point. One obvious thing is that she's looking very sad. There's been no comment about this so far. At this point in the interview though, the therapist goes off and talks about her relationships outside, and in particular, her relationship with her husband. We're gonna skip this section and rejoin the tape shortly after when he starts to pick up cues again about her feelings. 

00:55:25
  Well, knowing some of the emptiness is, you know, I don't think I make my life full of people and things that other people do. 

00:55:45
[sil.] 

00:55:45
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:50
BOB HOBSON  You, you, who said that you, uhm, you're far away from the people. 

00:56:05
 Uh hmm. That's right. 

00:56:05
BOB HOBSON Ah,- 

00:56:05
Understanding hypothesis 

00:56:05
BOB HOBSON  -ah, as if you're out of touch with them perhaps? 

00:56:10
  Hmm. 

00:56:20
[sil.] 

00:56:20
BOB HOBSON  And you feel that sometimes- 

00:56:25
Linking hypothesis 

00:56:25
BOB HOBSON - with your husband? 

00:56:25
  Yeah. 

00:56:30
BOB HOBSON I mean, you, who said you didn't want to bust(ph) them, but you also, you said you didn't think you really understand. 

00:56:35
 Well, I don't, I don't think he would really, 'coz he would, you know, he seems to get down the things all night. 

00:56:45
BOB HOBSON Yeah. 

00:56:45
 When he knows I was miserable last year but he seem can't(ph) go on for a while. 

00:56:50
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:56:55
 So, you have the miscarriages. 

00:56:55
BOB HOBSON  Well, if you had a miscarriage. 

00:57:00
FRANK MARGISON Wynona, further part of the interview where the therapist is faced with new material. The patient just recently been talking about her relationships outside, and in particular, with her husband. She then goes on to talk about an important event in her life. She mentioned that last year, she had a miscarriage. Let's look at that section again and see how the therapist responds to this new material. 

00:57:25
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:57:25
 So, you have the miscarriages. 

00:57:30
Cue 

00:57:30
BOB HOBSON Yeah. Well, if you have miscarriage. 

00:57:30
Picks up cue 

00:57:30
 (inaudible ) 

00:57:35
BOB HOBSON  Could, would you tell me about it? 

00:57:40
 Well, you know, we've sort of, we talked of having a family and then I, I did get pregnant and then I had a miscarriage quite soon after. And then we thought, well, well, we could try again for a little while, while he was studying. and I just don't know what to do for the first time. 

00:58:05
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. 

00:58:10
Understanding hypothesis 

00:58:10
BOB HOBSON  Perhaps this process(ph) was very upsetting too. 

00:58:15
  Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
BOB HOBSON Or mostly missed. 

00:58:20
 Oh, I just told everybody uhm, certain people were nice at the time, but they're not (inaudible ) just everybody (inaudible ). There's nothing to say. 

00:58:45
[sil.] 

00:58:45
BOB HOBSON  Yes, uh hmm, (inaudible ) have a, you are then upset now, aren't you? I mean, you haven't forgotten about it? 

00:58:53
  No. 

00:59:00
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:05
BOB HOBSON Uhm, it seems the dreadful feeling, I mean, that you miss? 

00:59:10
  Uh hmm. 

00:59:15
BOB HOBSON I mean whether that... 

00:59:15
  Hmm. 

00:59:20
BOB HOBSON ...ah, is an empty feeling or. 

00:59:20
 Well, it was really. "Could you so stop planning, huh, looking at the dates, you know, looking at next year and in the future and think it was an end. You haven't got any reason to live(ph)." 

00:59:35
BOB HOBSON  Hmm, I suppose it feels like ah, there is no future, and so you just. 

00:59:50
 Well, it's nothing, definitely, ah, nothing at all, nothing to look forward to really. 

01:00:00
BOB HOBSON The same to have hmm, void. 

01:00:00
FRANK MARGISON  Notice how in that section the therapist picked up her feelings rather than asking her about the facts of the miscarriage. It's very important because he gives his patient a space to express her feelings and she obviously gets upset in the interview. The therapist makes a guess about how she's feeling. He makes a series of understanding hypotheses, ended up with the notion of feeling in a void. The patient picks up this idea and extends it. Let's watch that section again with some captions and subtitles. 

01:00:40
BOB HOBSON  Yes, uh hmm, (inaudible ) have a,- 

01:00:46
Picks up cue 

01:00:46

01:01:10
 Hmm. 

01:01:10
BOB HOBSON ...ah, is an empty feeling or. 

01:01:15
 Well, it was really. "Could you just stop planning, huh, looking at that dates, you know, looking at next year and in the future and think it was an end. You haven't got any reason to live(ph)." 

01:01:30

01:02:15
BOB HOBSON - wouldn't understand or doesn't understand. I suppose you're scared I might not understand? 

01:02:20
  Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, if it was last week then I'm sure you, I think, would really upset (inaudible ) so get over it, then you, but you're gonna be in with, you should've got over it by then. (sighs) 

01:02:40

01:02:50
BOB HOBSON  And, and it seems to me that you're scared to, and look at me, uh hmm, unless you might see that I don't understand or I'm falling away or, uhm, or something like that. We'd like it better to be prompt(ph). 

01:03:05
 Well, it's true, I'm sorry. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
BOB HOBSON  Aha, however, I would like to have a look at it as it ah, ha, happens here. 

01:03:15
FRANK MARGISON In this section, the therapist explored her feelings of loss and emptiness. He uses the word "void." In the next section, some of the important problems, the patient looks away and the therapist makes a link with the here and now. He wonders whether she can't look at him in case he doesn't understand. Let's look at that section again and see how that goes. 

01:03:35
  Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, if it was last week then I'm sure you, I think, would really upset (inaudible ) so get over it,- 

01:03:50

01:04:55

01:05:25

01:05:40
BOB HOBSON  Well, one thing, you know, do, don't you feel that it's, it's important you can, to have somebody you can weep with? 

01:05:55
 Yes, I suppose if he's really(ph). 

01:06:00
BOB HOBSON Uh hmm. You know, not, not conscious miscarry, you know. 

01:06:05
Understanding hypothesis 

01:06:05
 Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
BOB HOBSON  You say whether I feel (inaudible ) really his, ah, you know, uhm, few people are not far away and you'd like to be close to them but, but you are scared of getting close because it might be too, too close. 

01:06:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:06:20
FRANK MARGISON  Let's replay that final section again and note how the therapist builds up his understanding about the patient's underlying fears. In the last section, the therapist has made a statement along the following lines. He said something like, "You want to be close but you keep the distance, because if you get too close, there'll be overwhelming fears." The fears implicit at this point are fear of either being alone or being overwhelmed. We could look again at this final section, though, and note how the therapist brings in a mistake he made earlier in the session about not telling her how long they had left. The final part shows the therapist starting to extend his understanding of her fears. He starts to talk about her feelings of anger which haven't yet been expressed in this session. 

01:07:10
BOB HOBSON Hmm. You know, not, not conscious miscarry, you know. 

01:07:15
Understanding hypothesis 

01:07:15
 Uh hmm.

 Uh hmm, and I get used to being on your own and alone so, going over on your own. (sighs) 

01:07:40
[sil.] 

01:07:40
BOB HOBSON  Now, I ought to say that, I have said that, ah, that we were going to meet for, uhm, for 40 minutes. I'm not sure ah, whether you know how long hmm, it was. (inaudible ) until night will flash, we only have five minutes more. And because it is important, isn't it, if, ah, if, if we're opening up things like that and this that you don't want to be left and dry with. 

01:08:15
 Hmm. 

01:08:15
BOB HOBSON  Because I think that's the other one of your fears here. 

01:08:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:08:20
BOB HOBSON I mean, it's all very well and we can cope(ph) by this but uhm, suppose I let things come and my tears flow and then I left with it. 

01:08:30
 That's right, I think. 

01:08:30
BOB HOBSON Ah, ah, and that can be very upsetting. 

01:08:35
[sil.] 

01:08:35
BOB HOBSON  It, it can make you feel like cross, too. 

01:08:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
Understanding hypothesis 

01:08:40
BOB HOBSON  I guess and it's just only a guess, but I guess you do feel already cross something like, eh, inside at times? 

01:08:50
  Well, sometimes I feel, I feel, I feel cross with myself when I come and get on all the things and then I just don't feel (inaudible ) cross with. Well, I get so angry at life, you know, I, well I mean that doesn't make sense really. 

01:09:15
BOB HOBSON Well, angry with life- 

01:09:15
Focus 

01:09:15
BOB HOBSON - (inaudible ) you just stay with that feeling a little bit? 

01:09:25
  Well, I think, you know, why should other people have children all right and, and I didn't? I mean, ah, and why should, you know, why should things go wrong? (sighs) 

01:09:45
[sil.] 

01:09:45
  And there was some other time when I think it was just me and trying to tell myself to get 'em with me. 

01:10:00
BOB HOBSON Yeah. I seemed to pick up hints in, in your cry but a lot of hints sometimes in the way you talk that, really, there's a lot of anger at times. And yeah, and it's so bloody unfair. 

01:10:15
 Hmm. 

01:10:15
Understanding Hypothesis 

01:10:15
BOB HOBSON Ha, and it really builds up into a rage inside you. 

01:10:20
 Well, it soon came to my mind that's even, you know, why other people got brothers and sisters and I haven't got brothers and sisters and that doesn't seem fair either. (crosstalk) 

01:10:25
BOB HOBSON  No. (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
 That's crazy, you know, doesn't make sense, I mean everybody's different. 

01:10:35
FRANK MARGISON  To end this tape, let's try to summarize what's happened so far. We're about a quarter of an hour into our first assessment session, and so far, the patient and therapist have tried to explore some feelings of loss and emptiness. The therapist is just about to go on to look at some as yet unexplored feelings of anger. The patient and therapist might carry on along these lines for a further half an hour or so. At the end of that time, the therapist would try to summarize what's happened in that first session. After that, he might try to make an initial contract. 

01:11:10
Contract - 

01:11:10
FRANK MARGISON An initial contract consisted unsocial statement about what's going to happen in future sessions, essentially include certain practical points- 

01:11:20
Future sessions: how often? how long? how many? 

01:11:20
FRANK MARGISON - about the frequency of sessions, the length of each session, and how many there are going to be. And in addition, it should contain some general statement about the aims and the focus of future therapy sessions. 

01:11:30
FRANK MARGISON  In the third tape in this series, we're looking again at some of these basic underlying skills and giving you an opportunity to practice some of them.

01:11:40
FRANK MARGISON  Here is the third tape in the series on the conversational model of psychotherapy. This tape allows you to practice some of the basic skills introduced in the first two tapes. There are number of pauses indicated by this symbol. At that point, you should practice responding as though you are the therapist. It's not expected that you use the same words as the original, that's the appeal of the comparison. You can use this tape either with a teacher or alone, but it's best in any case to try your interventions out loud. The sections in the tape responds: Using statements rather than questions. 

01:13:30
Negotiation 

01:13:30
FRANK MARGISON  Using a negotiating style. Picking up cues. Focusing on particular feelings. Using understanding hypotheses. Using linking hypotheses. 

01:13:50
Making a contract 

01:13:50
FRANK MARGISON And forming an initial therapeutic contract. Let's start with using statements. You remember from the first tape how important it is to avoid asking a series of direct questions. Statements make it easier for the patient to modify what the therapist have said. For example, a direct question might be, "Do you feel miserable?" It's quite simple to change that into a statement form as follows, "Maybe you're feeling miserable." It'll just require a very simple change in the sentence construction. 

01:14:25
Using statements 

01:14:25
FRANK MARGISON I'm now gonna give some examples for you to rephrase in a statement form. Here's the first example. 

01:14:30
Example 1 

01:14:30
FRANK MARGISON  Are you scared of being ill again? 

01:14:40
[sil.] 

01:14:40
  Most of the time, I feel all right 'coz I, you know, keep quite fit and I do exercises and I care about what I eat and all that. 

01:14:55
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. Do you just sound, ah, sound as if in some way, you're quite scared of being ill again? 

01:15:05
 Oh, yeah, very. 

01:15:10
BOB HOBSON What. 

01:15:10
FRANK MARGISON  Example 2. Was it a terrible hurt? 

01:15:20
[sil.] 

01:15:20
LOUISE ROGERS  Well, I just feel at the, I feel so very, very vulnerable I suppose, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
BOB HOBSON Hmm. It sounds as if there a, there's a terrible something that hurt. 

01:15:35
LOUISE ROGERS Oh, yeah, and it was very physical. 

01:15:35
FRANK MARGISON  Example 3. Is it all bottled up? 

01:15:45
[sil.] 

01:15:45
  This is it. I've got no way of, I can't, I can't have it all out at work. I can't let everybody in on, on that thing. 

01:16:00
SHIRLEY SEATON Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
 Uhm, this is it, what I, I. 

01:16:05
SHIRLEY SEATON  So, it's all bottled up inside? (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. There's no relief at all and. 

01:16:20
FRANK MARGISON In the last section, all you have to do is to rephrase a question in the form of a statement. In this section, we're going to look at negotiation. By negotiation, we mean showing an optimistic correction. If you're too authoritarian, it's less easy for the patient to respond openly. 

01:16:35
Negotiation 

01:16:35
FRANK MARGISON Let's look at an example. Note the tentative tone in the therapist's voice here, and he used the phrase, "I wonder." 

01:16:45
 You know, I just sit and then I just can't seem to get on with anything. 

01:16:50
BOB HOBSON I wonder how I'm going to(inaudible ). It's as if, if something seems to hold you up? 

01:16:55
  Yeah, it's kind of it, yes. 

01:17:00
FRANK MARGISON I'm now gonna give you some practice examples. I'll give you a statement phrased in an authoritarian way. What you should do is to try to rephrase it in a more negotiating, tentative style when the circle appears. 

01:17:15
FRANK MARGISON Practice Example 1. You feel cut off and lonely. 

01:17:25
[sil.] 

01:17:25
  I, I don't sort of, and I don't know even who I am. 

01:17:35
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. But I don't know, I, I might be wrong, but it seem more than that, but you're almost sort of cut off from people's some other world(ph), always on your own, your own world and... 

01:17:50
 Right. 

01:17:50
FRANK MARGISON ...very lonely? 

01:17:50
 When I got use sort of things that was personal, I'm a little bit, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
FRANK MARGISON Look. 

01:17:55
FRANK MARGISON Practice Example 2. You feel ashamed of being here. 

01:18:05
[sil.] 

01:18:05
BOB HOBSON  Having to be here? (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
 Hmm. 

01:18:15
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:18:15
 Leaving this kind of. 

01:18:15
BOB HOBSON Well, maybe, I think (inaudible ) perhaps should be ashamed of that. 

01:18:20
 Hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:18:20
BOB HOBSON I mean of having to be here. 

01:18:20
  Hmm. Yes, why have I ended like this when other people don't seem to? 

01:18:30
FRANK MARGISON Practice Example 3. You feel more upset on your own. 

01:18:40
[sil.] 

01:18:40
FRANK MARGISON  There's nothing as average life and so it's meaningful? 

01:18:50
 Yes. But it's not so. Uhm, it's just sort of going on, not of really gonna leave me. 

01:18:55
FRANK MARGISON  Hmm, that might be wrong within. Just wanna feel like sometimes on your own. And on your own, you feel much more upset than you're feeling now? Since those. (crosstalk) 

01:19:10
 Oh, yeah. I mean I suppose, in a way, it, it, uhm, well, lonely is not the right word, you know, but that I don't, I don't really feel very much involved with many people, I mean. (crosstalk) 

01:19:25
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:19:25
FRANK MARGISON In this section, we're going to look at picking up cues. You remember in the first tape, the cues are divided into three forms: verbal, vocal and non-verbal. You remember that verbal cues focused on the content of what's said, emphasizing feeling words. 

01:19:45
Vocal (tone of voice) 

01:19:45
FRANK MARGISON Vocal cues focused on how things are said. 

01:19:50
Non-verbal (posture, movements, facial expression) 

01:19:50
FRANK MARGISON And non-verbal cues focused on things such as posture. Note that you'll often pick up cues without specifically acknowledging them. In these brief excerpts, try to identify cues which could be helpful in understanding the psychotherapy session. 

01:20:05
Verbal cues 

01:20:05
FRANK MARGISON Try to identify a phrase which could be used as a verbal cue in each of the following examples. 

01:20:10
Example 1 

01:20:10
FRANK MARGISON  Each example will be followed by a caption specifying a verbal cue. 

01:20:15
FRANK MARGISON  Very, most of the time is spent. (crosstalk) 

01:20:20
 Hmm, no, because all the time, there's so much muddle and confusion occurring that I can't, can't see a way. I just seem to go from one crisis to another crisis. (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:20:35
 And there's no sort of breathing space. 

01:20:40
[sil.] 

01:20:40
FRANK MARGISON  Possible cues there would include "muddle and confusion" or "no breathing space." 

01:20:55
Example 2 

01:20:55
SHIRLEY SEATON  You got the feeling that you've, you haven't, you know, mentioning, and you've felt quite upset at that moment. (crosstalk) 

01:21:10
 Yes, I do. Uhm, because it, he was supposed I, I got closest to and, uhm, I was a fairly confident person. Uhm, I got plenty of reason to be confident and, and in coping at work and my social life, uhm, but he seemed to actually hold out against me and (sighs) he hurt me very badly. And, and so I seem to clammed up more and I can't, I can't find a way of getting over that other than drinking. 

01:21:55
FRANK MARGISON  Possible cues could be her statement about being hurt very badly, but the phrase "clammed up" might be a useful metaphor to explore. 

01:22:15
Example 3 

01:22:15
  It could be quite sort of logical and cruel where I always let my emotions run away with me. When it is, I still walk away. 

01:22:35
MADDY OSBORN Hmm. 

01:22:35
 Well, that was it, maybe. Now, I just left, feeling quite, quite useless, really. 

01:22:50
[sil.] 

01:22:50
  And really, I, I, that was just how it happened, I, they just sort of, relationship just sort of fizzled out, but I can't. I don't even know whether I will left him or not now. 

01:23:10
MADDY OSBORN Can you tell me a bit more about feeling useless? That sounds as if it didn't go up into me. 

01:23:15
"emotions run away... ...quite useless... 

01:23:15
FRANK MARGISON  There are number of possible cues here, particularly "feeling useless" and "fizzled out." The therapist chooses to pick up "feeling useless." 

01:23:35
Vocal cues 

01:23:35
FRANK MARGISON  In each of the following examples, try to pick up a quality in the tone of voice which might imply how the patient is feeling. 

01:23:50
Example 1 

01:23:50
  Well, the last time I came, it was sort of, you know, it was okay. But I mean, is that it? 

01:24:00
MADDY OSBORN  But you were let down. 

01:24:05
 Well, I feel let down. You know, luckily I would feel let down, if, you know, if I spend, we have a long, you set 40 minutes talking to you, and then next week, it's seven tales(ph) again. 

01:24:10
MADDY OSBORN  Uh hmm. 

01:24:15
 Well, I mean, you know, carry on with it. You know, ask me what you want. 

01:24:20
Condescending, irritable tone 

01:24:20
FRANK MARGISON  The patient sounds quite condescending and irritated. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. It might masked fear on the patient's part. 

01:24:45
Example 2 

01:24:45
  I really want someone to come and put me right. Well, to put me right because I don't how to do it. What if I could? 

01:25:00
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:25:00
 I would if I could. I feel so lost. Uhm, I want someone to come and tell me what to do. 

01:25:15
[sil.] 

01:25:15
FRANK MARGISON  Note the patient's child-like tone. This might say something important about her view of the therapist. 

01:25:30
Example 3 

01:25:30
  Also, the other left would be dependent on other people, I mean, particularly my parents. 

01:25:45
  Hmm. 

01:25:50
Upset, choked voice 

01:25:50
FRANK MARGISON  The patient sounds distressed. There's a choked tone to her voice. 

01:26:05
Non~verbal cues 

01:26:05
FRANK MARGISON  In each of the following examples, try to pick up a piece of non-verbal behavior which might give you some clue as to how the patient is feeling. 

01:26:15
Example 1 

01:26:15
  Because I feel ra, I feel rather embarrassed admitting to what I feel. 

01:26:35
SHIRLEY SEATON Hmm. Embarrassed? 

01:26:35
FRANK MARGISON  Note how she is fingering her necklace. This might indicate anxiety. 

01:26:55
Example 2 

01:26:55
BOB HOBSON  You're upset. 

01:27:10
  Hmm. 

01:27:15
FRANK MARGISON  Like the last example, twisting hair might indicate that the patient is anxious and upset. You might even use a phrase like "feeling screwed up," to indicate your understanding in a literal way. 

01:27:35
Example 3 

01:27:35
BOB HOBSON  You, for a short time, you were, you, you were in touch with the... (crosstalk) 

01:27:50
LOUISE ROGERS Hmm. 

01:27:50
BOB HOBSON ...feeling upset (inaudible ). 

01:27:54
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

01:27:55
[sil.] 

01:27:55
LOUISE ROGERS  It's just, I don't know, the more I talk, the more, I, it's just don't, don't mean anything, it's just the feeling of, hmm, yeah, feeling very, nothing new. And it's, well, it's not even nothing. It's bad, you know. 

01:28:15
Looks thoughtful, then upset 

01:28:15
FRANK MARGISON  In this example, there cues are far more subtle. Note the change in expression after she shakes her head. Let's look at that example again. 

01:28:40
BOB HOBSON Hmm, for a short time, you were, you, you were in touch with the... 

01:28:45
LOUISE ROGERS Hmm. 

01:28:45
BOB HOBSON ...feeling upset (inaudible ) 

01:28:49
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

01:28:50
[sil.] 

01:28:50
LOUISE ROGERS  It's just the more I talk, the more I, it's just don't, don't mean anything, it's just the feeling of, hmm, yeah, feeling very, nothing new. It's not even nothing that is bad, you know. 

01:29:10
Focusing on feelings 

01:29:10
FRANK MARGISON  The previous examples showed cues, which were not necessarily acknowledged. In this section, we're going to look at how you can focus on particular cues and get the patient to amplify. Look at this example. 

01:29:25
BOB HOBSON  Let's stay with the hurt a bit, shall we? (crosstalk) 

01:29:30
 Hmm. 

01:29:30
BOB HOBSON  Can you, can you say something about that? 

01:29:35
  Hurt. 

01:29:40
[sil.] 

01:29:40
  Uhm. I think I feel hurt when people (inaudible ) for me when I, and I expect them to be. I'll be there for them. 

01:29:55
Example 1 

01:29:55
FRANK MARGISON In this next practice example, the patient uses the word failed. Pick up that cue and ask the patient to stay with that feeling. 

01:30:05
 Yes, why, why have I ended up like this when other people don't seem to, they seem to have coped very well and I seem to have failed (inaudible ) failed, really. 

01:30:20
[sil.] 

01:30:20
  I seem to have failed (inaudible ) failed, really. 

01:30:32
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. I wonder whether we could we stay with that word, failed. Hmm. You know, get it inside and see what it feels like. 

01:30:50
Example 2 

01:30:50
FRANK MARGISON  In the next more complex example, the patient has been talking about being blocked and scared about feelings in her relationship with her boyfriend. Acknowledge these feelings and get the patient to stay with them in the session. 

01:31:05
LOUISE ROGERS (inaudible ) I feel quite a lot for my boyfriend, I've lost all trust in him. And I think I've lost commitment and, and... (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:31:15
LOUISE ROGERS ...I feel completely blocked towards him. Andy, I've never, (crosstalk) 

01:31:20
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:31:20
LOUISE ROGERS I feel very, very strange. 

01:31:25
[sil.] 

01:31:25
LOUISE ROGERS  Feel very, very strange. 

01:31:30
BOB HOBSON  Hmm. So if, ah, I wonder whether we can get into the feeling a bit more. Uhm, as if, uhm, they were in the house. 

01:31:45
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

01:31:45
BOB HOBSON The sort of feeling that you might have. You would like to be close to him, uhm, but you're scared... (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

01:31:50
BOB HOBSON ...in some way, perhaps? 

01:31:55
LOUISE ROGERS Oh, yeah. 

01:31:55
Example 3 

01:31:55
FRANK MARGISON In this last practice example, pick up the cue, and try to get the patient to stay with the experience. 

01:32:00
  So, when I was driving along here today I thought it was a nice day and the sun shining and everything is all right, really, and I was feeling quite happy and that sort of thing. 

01:32:25
[sil.] 

01:32:25
  I was feeling quite happy and that sort of thing. 

01:32:35
BOB HOBSON  Yeah, but, ah, but you're not quite happy now? 

01:32:40
  No. 

01:32:45
BOB HOBSON Well, now, I wonder whether we can have a look at what it feels like now. I know it's a bit scaring to him that. (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:32:55
BOB HOBSON Uhm, it, it's not easy to put things into words when you're scared. Hmm. But, ah, if I got it right, you're, you're saying that you're feeling down? 

01:33:10
 Yes. 

01:33:10
BOB HOBSON I mean now, right now? 

01:33:15
 Yes. 

01:33:15
FRANK MARGISON The next section deals with understanding hypotheses. You remember that an understanding hypotheses is a statement, which tries to imagine how the patient is feeling. Just use the phrase in a tentative way. For example, I wonder if you're feeling a bit scared. Look at this example. Here, the therapist tries to pick up the patient's feelings of being isolated. 

01:33:40
  Well, I, I think, used to think of it (inaudible ), but I think now I do. I think now I got a problem. 

01:33:50
BOB HOBSON  Well, now that you (inaudible ) now, ah, and you can't let your husband know you own feeling because he's so busy, or, it would upset him only, he wouldn't understand. 

01:34:05
 Hmm. 

01:34:05
BOB HOBSON  And I think you must feel very, very lonely. 

01:34:15
 Yeah, I do, sometimes. 

01:34:15
BOB HOBSON  Very cut off when I say dead and empty. 

01:34:20
FRANK MARGISON  In these practice examples, try to make a statement, which responds to the patient's feelings. 

01:34:30
Example 1 

01:34:30
FRANK MARGISON In this example, try to make a guess about the patient feeling sad. 

01:34:35
 I mean, I'm, I'm the one who's supposed to have some control and, uhm, and manage things, really. And. 

01:34:50
[sil.] 

01:34:50
  I'm the one who's supposed to have some control and, uhm, and manage things, really. And to suppose. (crosstalk) 

01:35:15
SHIRLEY SEATON It sounds quite sad, really. 

01:35:15
  It is. Because I can only rely on myself. 

01:35:20
Example 2 

01:35:20
FRANK MARGISON  In the next example, make an understanding hypothesis about her feeling as though she's spinning around. 

01:35:35
  Well, it's like, sort of, not sort of wanting to turning off two directions at once, and not, not sort of turning any one direction. (crosstalk) 

01:35:45
FRANK MARGISON  Hmm. 

01:35:50
 And, and yet, not moving, yeah. 

01:35:55
[sil.] 

01:35:55
  And yet, not moving, yeah. 

01:36:05
FRANK MARGISON You're feeling it's like you're sort of spinning around, and trying to get in the right direction. (crosstalk) 

01:36:10
 Hmm. 

01:36:10
FRANK MARGISON Though the direction seem wrong. 

01:36:10
 Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:36:15
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:36:15
Example 3 

01:36:15
FRANK MARGISON In this example, make an understanding hypothesis about her fears about being ill again. 

01:36:20
  I can't control that, but, ah, most of the time, I feel right 'coz I, I keep quite fit, and I do exercises and I care about what I eat and all that. 

01:36:40
[sil.] 

01:36:40
  And I keep quite fit, and I do exercises and I care about what I eat and all that. 

01:36:55
BOB HOBSON Hmm. Do, do you sound, sound as if in some way, you're quite scared of being ill again. 

01:37:05
 Oh, yeah, very. 

01:37:05
FRANK MARGISON  The next section deals with linking hypotheses. Here's a slightly more complex an understanding hypotheses in that they try to link together two or more areas of the patient's feelings. In this preliminary example, note that the therapist links the patient's feelings of being on her own with the suggestion that she might feel separate, actually, in the interview. 

01:37:30
 I don't really feel very much involved with many people anymore, yeah. 

01:37:35
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:37:35
  I, I mean, I've, I suppose, when I was a young girl (inaudible ) good friends, you know, but we've moved around a bit and (inaudible ). 

01:37:48
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. When you're saying you felt quite lonely, were sort of separate from people, thought it was a little bit the same in here, it is a bit difficult for you to, for you (inaudible ) talking when you say that. 

01:38:00
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:38:00
FRANK MARGISON Do you feel very separate? 

01:38:00
FRANK MARGISON In the first practice example, you'll see the patient talking about being frustrated by time limits. 

01:38:05
Example 1 

01:38:05
FRANK MARGISON  When the circle appears, try to make a link between that and her feeling in the session. That is, that she might feel the time is limited with you. 

01:38:15
 It's as though, as though I set myself sort of time, time tables... (crosstalk) 

01:38:25
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

01:38:25
 ...of things to do, and when they don't work out, that's when I get sort of frustrated almost to a sort of panicky stage and then. (crosstalk) 

01:38:40
FRANK MARGISON Panicking inside? 

01:38:40
 Uh hmm. 

01:38:40
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:38:40
 And then, it just doesn't seem, (crosstalk) 

01:38:45
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:38:45
  just doesn't seem worth, (crosstalk) 

01:38:50
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:38:50
 worth going forward with anything. 

01:38:55
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

01:39:00
[sil.] 

01:39:00
  Just doesn't seem worth, (crosstalk) 

01:39:05
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:39:05
  worth going forward with anything. 

01:39:10
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. Well, I'll, I will be quite (inaudible ) on this. I wonder whether it's not a bit the same in here that we came in here and you weren't quite sure what to expect and there really isn't much of a time table (inaudible ) and we're supposed to stop after 10 minutes (inaudible ). 

01:39:26
Example 2 

01:39:26
FRANK MARGISON In the next practice example, the patient say she is worried about what people would think of her. Make a link with her fears about what you might think of her. 

01:39:35
BOB HOBSON You don't have to feel good all the time, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
  Yeah. 

01:39:40
 And I, I can feel bad, and uhm, that I'm have to be strong all the time, that I can allow to be weak, and then allow to, I mean not to cope really. 

01:39:50
BOB HOBSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:39:50
  And not to worry really about what people think about me that much. 

01:39:55
BOB HOBSON Yeah. 

01:40:00
[sil.] 

01:40:00
  And not to worry really about what people think about me that much. 

01:40:10
BOB HOBSON Yeah. But they (inaudible ) have a bit of a feeling now that you're concerned a bit what I'm going to think of and (inaudible ) what are you going to do (inaudible ) well here? 

01:40:27
FRANK MARGISON For the next practice example on linking hypotheses, you're in a similar situation. The patient has been talking about her fears of being a failure. 

01:40:35
Example 3 

01:40:35
FRANK MARGISON Try to make a link with her fears of being a failure with you failing at being a patient in therapy. 

01:40:40
BOB HOBSON  Now, the, the, that he was getting all the comfort, all the help and, and you are expected to cope, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
 That's it, that's it. 

01:40:50
BOB HOBSON  and be all right. 

01:40:55
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. Lucy's all right, she'll cope, you know, at least coping. My mom's got this wonderful idea of coping as long as you cope you're ok, you don't have to enjoy life, you just have to cope with it, well, everybody copes really. 

01:41:05
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:41:10
[sil.] 

01:41:10
LOUISE ROGERS  Well, everybody copes really. 

01:41:15
BOB HOBSON Hmm. 

01:41:15
LOUISE ROGERS  And it's, ah, yes, it. (crosstalk) 

01:41:20
BOB HOBSON But I don't know, isn't it that you go, (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

01:41:25
BOB HOBSON ah, get the, the thing you ought to cope... (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

01:41:25
BOB HOBSON  ah, ah, and that coping is such a wonderful thing. (crosstalk) 

01:41:30
LOUISE ROGERS Yeah. 

01:41:30
BOB HOBSON And yet inside somehow that must make you feel scared? Ah. (crosstalk) 

01:41:35
LOUISE ROGERS  And it, it block, it blocks me off I think, if, if I feel I've got to cope then I don't, then don't really get into emotions because once I start getting emotional, I don't cope. 

01:41:50
BOB HOBSON No. 

01:41:50
Making a contract 

01:41:50
FRANK MARGISON This last section looks at the forming of a therapeutic contract at the end of an initial interview. You remember that the contract usually contains the following information. Some practical points about the frequency, length and number of future sessions, and also a general statement about the aims of therapy and the focus of future sessions. Now, look at this example. 

01:42:15
 I don't feel as panicky now as the beginning. I think it is helping to, to talk although I feel, say, vulnerable talking about it. 

01:42:30
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:42:30
  Somehow that's, that panic, that anxiety... (crosstalk) 

01:42:35
FRANK MARGISON Hmm. 

01:42:35
 ...in a way, is sort of lessening. 

01:42:40
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. But as you feel more comfortable talking to me about it then things start to intrude, the lights and the camera (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
 Hmm. 

01:42:50
FRANK MARGISON Feels sort of exposed again. 

01:42:50
 Hmm. 

01:42:50
FRANK MARGISON  Yeah. I think what, what might help is a chance to talk things over, perhaps over the next, ah, five or six weeks to get a chance to know a bit more about how that feels and how we can work out, ah, a plan how we can help in the future. Well, how would you feel about coming back? About 45 minutes each week for the next say, six weeks so we can talk over these feelings of panic and, ah, vulnerability, feeling you're not worth anything. And feeling sort of used and abused, well, I just wonder whether, how you'd feel about that? 

01:43:30
  Uhm, well, I noticed at the beginning I am, I feel in such a pit. Really now that things have got to, (crosstalk) 

01:43:45
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

01:43:45
 have got to alter and can't sort of go on in this sort of muddle. (crosstalk) 

01:43:50
FRANK MARGISON I'm not sure. 

01:43:50
FRANK MARGISON  In that example the therapist included the following information in the forming of the therapeutic contract. 

01:44:00
Timing - 6 weekly sessions 45 mins each Focus - exposed feeling panic and vulnerability 

01:44:00
FRANK MARGISON There were to be six weekly sessions each for 45 minutes. The aim will be to look at her feelings of exposure, and also to talk about her feelings of panic and vulnerability. Sometimes the therapeutic contract can be much less specific than that. For example, the patient may not be quite sure whether he or she wants to continue in therapy. In this practice example, try to form a therapeutic contract in the following situation. 

01:44:30
With a suspicious patient, referred by court, make a contract for four 40' weekly sessions: review aims and decide 'do we go on?' 

01:44:30
FRANK MARGISON You've just been seeing a very suspicious patient who has been referred to you for an assessment into by the courts. What you want to try to do is to set a contract for about four 40-minute weekly sessions. The aims will be quite general. What you want to do in these four sessions is to review the purpose of treatment and invite whether the patient wants to come back to see you again. So, at the end of the contract you want to be able to say how many times you're going to meet again, and what the general aims should be. Try to form a therapeutic contract using that information and then we'll show you how it might have gone. 

01:45:15
[sil.] 

01:45:15
FRANK MARGISON  I think it's important the decision is yours. If you wanted that time, then we could try and arrange it. But if you don't, then we don't arrange it that you feel you got some control over it. 

01:45:30
  Well, I don't mind, don't mind doing it and it just depends. I mean what is the reason? That's, that's, what's it all about? 

01:45:45
FRANK MARGISON Yeah. 

01:45:45
 Well because the, the people who sent me here and the people that, that I've, who have dealt with me, as they say, recently haven't been doing it for me. 

01:45:55
FRANK MARGISON  Yeah. Well, so, the idea I had in mind is. (crosstalk) 

01:46:00
 I'm certainly got to think that you are. 

01:46:00
FRANK MARGISON  Well, I guess this isn't quite a good to get (inaudible ). But what I thought we could do is to meet for say, let's say four times for about 40 minutes each time. I just, shall we talk over what you're up to and what you might need help with, with those any other commitments and other (inaudible ) but just to talk generally about it and to see where we get to and, and after that fourth meeting we decide whether there was anything specifically you want me to help with and if not (inaudible ) but to leave it up like that with, that sort of framework, that's would, would makes things a bit more, I don't know, a bit more open between us (inaudible ) things are very suspicious and wary of them. 

01:46:45
 Yeah, I, well, I think that's quite reasonable on my part, but I'll be prepared to do that. 

01:46:50
FRANK MARGISON  Let's try to summarize what we've done in this tape. We started off with some basic therapeutic skills. Rephrasing questions in the form of a statement and using a negotiating manner. We then moved on to picking up cues and how to focus on particular feelings in a session. We looked at understanding and linking hypotheses with a chance to practice those and ended with the formation of the therapeutic contract at the end of an initial interview. It's important to note though that we didn't do with the timing of interventions or with the overall strategy of therapy. You might find it helpful to deal with that, say, in a supervision group. However, we hope that by practicing some of these skills, you'll feel more confident as a therapist.
