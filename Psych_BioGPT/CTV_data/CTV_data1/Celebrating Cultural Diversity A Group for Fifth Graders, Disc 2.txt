Session 3 

00:00:05
SAM STEEN Last week before we ended, I don't know if you recall, but Roman(ph) wanted to take some time to check in to see where we were on the comfort, within the comfort zone. Now, before we begin, I'm just curious to you all ah, are you interested in saying what you currently feel about, how comfortable you are in this group session. Yes, so if you like. 

00:00:30
SHERI BAUMAN I think just for clarification, wasn't it your idea Daidge(ph)? 

00:00:35
That was mine, I said they… 

00:00:35
SHERI BAUMAN And I well, anyway. 

00:00:35
SAM STEEN It was from that side of, ah… 

00:00:40
SHERI BAUMAN Of the group, and…

00:00:40
DAIDGE (ph) I said, shall we just leave it in the middle, I said so. 

00:00:40
SAM STEEN Yes, Daidge(ph) said to leave it and, and Roman(ph) actually came with the idea and I asked Roman(ph) if you were okay for waiting till this weekend, he said. 

00:00:50
Yes. 

00:00:50
SAM STEEN Yes. 

00:00:50
SHERI BAUMAN And I didn't get a chance to say that I think it's really cool that you guys have ideas like that. Because that makes it more or not Sam and my group, but it's our group. 

00:01:00

SHERI BAUMAN How about one to ten. Ten is, is the best week of your life ever, and one is worst.

00:03:10
What about you Sam? 

00:03:10
SAM STEEN What mine was… Actually I hadn't really thought about it, but there was a comment that Dordge(ph) said that made me happy right up just now, and she said, this is fun, like meeting in the group were you talking about. This if fun, so that really made me feel good. 

00:03:25
Uh…Huh…

SAM STEEN So let's say, at this point, I would give it a ten, best day ever. 

00:03:35

00:04:20
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… Five, because I missed my meet and I went to the (inaudible ).

00:04:35
SAM STEEN Oh, sorry. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Uh…Huh… Thanks. So you want to take a minute and tell us where you are now in terms of how comfortable you feel about being in the group or how willing you are to take a risk. You can move your, do you remember you color? 

00:04:55
Uh…Huh… 

00:04:55
SAM STEEN Okay, and if you need more tape let me know. You're right. 

00:05:00
Alright… (Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

00:05:00
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

00:05:05
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

00:05:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:05:10
Very colorful. 

00:05:10
SAM STEEN Okay, did you move yours Oligue? 

00:05:15
Ah, I can move that. 

00:05:15
SAM STEEN I will. 

00:05:15
Oligue do you want to (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:05:25
SAM STEEN She moved hers and mine, I'm still. 

00:05:30
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

00:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN I can't remember which one is mine. 

00:05:35
SAM STEEN Yours is the yellow one. Go ahead. Why you're laughing? Because this is the same place and we doesn't, it doesn't move around. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Or just you can't, how we describe it. 

00:05:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, so I need to kind of understand, well, I'm not sure what we're meaning, so for me that meant, I am feeling very safe and comfortable. 

00:06:00
SAM STEEN That you can share anything you want. 

00:06:05
SHERI BAUMAN And that I could take risk. 

00:06:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:06:05
SHERI BAUMAN Because everybody has been so respectful of each other. 

00:06:10
SAM STEEN Is that right? 

00:06:10
Umm… 

00:06:10
SAM STEEN Is that what the middle means that you feel comfortable here? 

00:06:15
Yes. 

00:06:15
SAM STEEN Right. We all agree about that. 

00:06:15
Yeah. 

00:06:15
SAM STEEN What if you not necessarily in the middle, what do you think that that means? 

00:06:20
ROMAN (ph) You're taking no risk. 

00:06:25
SAM STEEN So, you maybe uncomfortable but you're still willing to take a risk? 

00:06:25
Oh, it's like you are comfortable but you want to take a risk. 

00:06:30
SAM STEEN But you want to take a risk. 

00:06:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! 

00:06:30
SAM STEEN Ileana, is that the same for you, because I see yours is still kind of out there too? What color is yours? 

00:06:35
ILEANA MEIN White. 

00:06:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, yours is still kinda further away from the middle. What does it mean for you Ileana? 

00:06:40
ILEANA MEIN Umm… Like taking a risk. 

00:06:45
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Like you wanna take a risk. Yeah. Who's green? 

00:06:50
Mine. 

00:06:50
SAM STEEN So you agree so that what yours. 

00:06:50
Uh…Huh… 

00:06:50
SAM STEEN And mine is pink. I think Sheri you were asking a question. I think I feel the same way, like I'm comfortable I could be in the middle, but I am also willing to take a risk too. So that's what… 

00:07:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I feel like I won't need too to express, but anyway. I'm really glad you guys suggested that we take another look at this. So… 

00:07:10
SAM STEEN Daidge(ph) can you move your chair a little, so I can see your face. There you go, thanks. O. 

00:07:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. Well, we are going to do another activity and this one's gonna be a little challenging, and so we put it kind of in the middle so it's not the very first thing we do, because we need you to feel comfortable and that it's not a very last thing we do, so we'll have the chance to do some ah, other kinds of things and it's gonna ask us to take the little bit of a risk, so the first thing… 

00:07:40
SAM STEEN And do you mind if I move this? Can I move it to the side? 

00:07:40
Yes. 

00:07:40
SAM STEEN Okay. 

00:07:40
And those snowballs. 

00:07:45
SHERI BAUMAN They are not snowballs, but they might look like one. Would each of you take one of these, and it's gonna represent your, well, this is like a juggling act, ah? And I apologize I didn't get enough of the same size. So… 

00:08:00
SAM STEEN I will (inaudible ) little bigger. 

00:08:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, we have bigger heads so, and then since this is gonna represent ourselves like who we are, how about just you take ah, one of the markers and put your initials on it. Later if you wanna do more with it and decorate it, you can do that, but just, so that we will remember that the, what this represents is us. 

00:08:35
Big eggs. 

00:08:35
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. 

00:08:40
No, like really what it's about, this was hands. 

00:08:45
SAM STEEN You need one? 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:08:55
SAM STEEN Thanks. 

00:09:00
Can we put my initials. 

00:09:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:09:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that's what we're doing. Umm… 

00:09:00
Sam what do you think, shall we pass these around and everybody take some? 

00:09:05
SAM STEEN Umm… Yeah, maybe just a few, you know, a handful like they depend on as many M&amp;M's, so. 

00:09:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:09:15
SAM STEEN If that's easiest. 

00:09:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, take just a few of the toothpicks… 

00:09:15
How many do you like three… 

00:09:20
Four. 

00:09:20
SAM STEEN No may be… 

00:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN No, just a… 

00:09:20
SAM STEEN A handful. 

00:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN …just a little handful and you're not gonna have to eat them this time. So you don't have… And they won't melt, so you don't have to worry about some of those problems we had with the M&amp;M's last week, ah. So… 

00:09:30
Oh, yeah. 

00:09:30
SHERI BAUMAN But just take a few and I'll leave them in the middle, because some of us may want to get… 

00:09:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, few more. 

00:09:35
SHERI BAUMAN …few more as we go. We'll see. 

00:09:40
Three? 

00:09:40
SHERI BAUMAN No, get a handful. 

00:09:45
Ha…ha…ha. Thank you. 

00:09:45
SAM STEEN You're welcome. 

00:09:45
SHERI BAUMAN Here, there go. 

00:09:50
You can pass the balls. 

00:09:55
SHERI BAUMAN Well, you know what my snowball is leaking on me. This is yours? 

00:10:00
No. 

00:10:00
SAM STEEN The basket. 

00:10:00
She's means like the white stuff. 

00:10:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, like it looks like I, my shirt has dandruff now. Have you noticed? 

00:10:05
Dandruff! 

00:10:05
What's this? 

00:10:10
I just think… 

00:10:10
SHERI BAUMAN We'll tell you just… That stands for you. Who you are? 

00:10:10
That's your initials? 

00:10:10
SAM STEEN Sam Steen. 

00:10:15
DORDGE (ph) SS. 

00:10:15
SAM STEEN Double S. Yours? 

00:10:20
DORDGE (ph) DJ. 

00:10:20
SAM STEEN DJ? 

00:10:20
DORDGE (ph) I put D and J. 

00:10:25
That's… That's enough for her. 

00:10:25
Oops. 

00:10:25
SAM STEEN (Crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:10:25
SHERI BAUMAN It's fine for now, and we'll just put them in the middle, so that if anybody needs more as we go on. 

00:10:35
DM. 

00:10:35
SAM STEEN Because they're (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:10:40
Something in my shirt there… 

00:10:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, we're sort of like kangaroos, ah? Oops! 

00:10:45
SAM STEEN You need some? 

00:10:45
Yes. 

00:10:50
Ah, oh…oh… 

00:10:50
SAM STEEN Oh, oh! You want some more? 

00:10:55
Yeah. 

00:10:55
SAM STEEN Okay. Sheri shall I put in here in case you need a few more. 

00:11:00
SHERI BAUMAN Finished it, alight? 

00:11:05
SAM STEEN Not yet. 

00:11:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So, everybody has yourself, this is represents you and it doesn't have any blemishes. There is nothing. It's kind of you know the perfect self. What? 

00:11:20
Not me. 

00:11:20
SHERI BAUMAN Did not… 

00:11:20
It doesn't look.. 

00:11:20
SHERI BAUMAN No it doesn't resemble us. 

00:11:20
SAM STEEN Yeah, (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:11:25
SHERI BAUMAN It just represents it. But it's, it's clean and whole and has no, remember we were looking at bruises and things, it doesn't have any of those. And what this exercise is about is what happens to ourself, when people say discriminatory or hurtful or mean things. So, I am gonna ask you some questions and I am gonna read a script. Ah… So, I will be looking down and I've done this before, I have to say it's very difficult for me to do, so I, I am ah, need to build up my courage to do my part and what I want you to do is when I ask these questions anytime that you would say to yourself, yes. Put a toothpick in yourself, and if it's something that has happened to you lots of times, you might wanna put… 

00:12:20
If it's only happened once or… 

00:12:20
SHERI BAUMAN …Umm… If it… If it has only happened once, then you put one toothpick. 

00:12:25
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:12:25
SHERI BAUMAN If it has happened a million times, you may just want to put a couple… 

00:12:25
SAM STEEN A couple. 

00:12:25
SHERI BAUMAN And if hasn't happened at all, you may not… 

00:12:30
Two or four. 

00:12:30
SHERI BAUMAN Excuse me. 

00:12:30
SAM STEEN Two or three or four… 

00:12:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, however. 

00:12:30
SAM STEEN And also if it, let's say it only happened once, but it was very painful, then you can either push it kind of deeper in there or you can may be put a couple because, that's how hurtful it was. 

00:12:40
DAIDGE (ph) Dig a lot in or just deep down. 

00:12:45
SAM STEEN Or more than one, because it was very painful. 

00:12:45
Once we (crosstalk)(inaudible) you can, you can still… 

00:12:45
SHERI BAUMAN So, these are gonna represent the hurts, the injuries that happened to us as we experience some of these (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:12:55
SAM STEEN Does that make sense, to you guys? 

00:12:55
Umm… 

00:12:55
SAM STEEN Okay. 

00:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:13:00
SAM STEEN So, and also you have to kind of be quiet when you hear it, so everybody can hear the question being read. That'll be helpful. 

00:13:05
SHERI BAUMAN I think I actually wish and do this part in silence and then afterwards we'll have a chance to talk about it okay. 

00:13:10
Uh…Huh… 

00:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So, has anyone ever put you down ah, because you're a boy or a girl or said, boys don't do that or big boys don't cry or girls aren't good enough to do that or girls can't play sports? Okay. Have you ever been called names, because of how rich or how poor people think you are or where you live like trailer trash, white trash, stuck-up, snooty rich girl? Have you ever been teased about your height, hey shrimp, being told, pip-squeak? Have you ever felt bad when someone called you names about your weight, like fatso or gordo or skinny-minny, bones, lardo, blimp? Have you ever been teased about physical features like four eyes, or pizza face or brace face or metal mouth? Have you have ever been called names or heard slurs about your race or your ethnic group, like black, (inaudible ), crook, chink, tonto, chief… 

00:14:45
I know chinks. 

00:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN …wetback, Greecer, Beaner, dirty Jew, Kike, Spic, Nigger, honky, squaw? Have you ever been put down about your IQ, like retard or geek or brain or dumb-dumb or stupid, uh…huh… 

00:15:25
He looks like he didn't have one. 

00:15:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well. I think it does feel bad, to hear those things. So, anybody have any hurtful things like that that I didn't say that you're willing to share? 

00:15:45
SAM STEEN You mean ah, like something that, something has happened to (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:15:45
SHERI BAUMAN Some kind… Some kind of cruel discriminatory remark that you've heard that I didn't say. Even though I said a bunch of very cruel things. Yeah. 

00:16:00
ILEANA MEIN Did you say shorty? 

00:16:05
SHERI BAUMAN No but, that would have been a good one, ah. So, you wanna say shorty, I'll stick it in there. 

00:16:15
SAM STEEN Anything else. 

00:16:20
SHERI BAUMAN Is anybody willing to, to share just what it was like, to even hear me say such awful things and how it felt to look at ourselves, we are all sticky and poky and sharp and not very soft to touch anymore, ah? Anybody want to share, what it was like for you? 

00:16:45
SAM STEEN Was that an easy thing to do? 

00:16:50
No. 

00:16:50
SAM STEEN It wasn't even rather easy thing to hear some the words? 

00:16:55
SHERI BAUMAN I found myself remembering some that I hadn't heard for long time. So, they must have made an impression on me even though, they happened when I was your age, I still remember it. 

00:17:05
SAM STEEN There were… There were times were a couple of people were laughing and we know some of the words are funny if you first hear them, but then other people were saying that's not funny, ah. 

00:17:15
(Inaudible ) some people are (inaudible ). 

00:17:20
SAM STEEN Maybe they weren't sure what it meant. Maybe sometimes we laugh when, do you think we ever laugh when we're uncomfortable about something? 

00:17:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, yeah… 

00:17:30
SAM STEEN Sometimes. 

00:17:30
SHERI BAUMAN …kind of a giggly nervous laugh. 

00:17:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. And that's okay, we are not mad at you, we know that again, it's hard to do. Ah… But we would wanna give you another opportunity, is there anything you can think of that someone may have said that was hurtful to you in the past or even that you may have overheard? 

00:17:45
SHERI BAUMAN Because sometimes they may not have said it to you, but they say it around you. 

00:17:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:17:50
SHERI BAUMAN I can share one when I was actually started just about at your age, I stared to get pimples, zits. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Uh…huh… And I'd never forgotten it. 

00:18:05
SAM STEEN Umm… 

00:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN Because you know what I couldn't change it. 

00:18:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:18:10
SHERI BAUMAN And it really made me feel like that's all they saw. 

00:18:15
SAM STEEN There was one time where I went into a store and I was thinking I went with some friends, there was a few black, black boys together we were hanging out and ah, we were followed around and they kinda asked us to leave if weren't gonna buy anything. And although they didn't call us the names or anything like that, I just felt very uncomfortable and I felt like they kind of singled me out. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
SHERI BAUMAN Are you mad at your self or you… 

00:18:50
No there is one word. 

00:18:50
SHERI BAUMAN You pushed someway in there, did you do that on purpose because they were hurtful? 

00:18:55
Uh…Huh… 

00:18:55
SHERI BAUMAN No. Anybody willing to share, even one. 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:05
SAM STEEN Well, how are you feeling right now? 

00:19:10
Bad. 

00:19:10
SAM STEEN Kind of bad. A little bit or I think Alex(ph) is a little quite, you said a little polite. How are you feeling now? 

00:19:20
ALEX (ph) (Inaudible ). 

00:19:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… I saw your reaction when we were laughing at some noise that were a little funny and you kind of said, that's not funny. Like you really had a strong, even your face was expressing how you felt about it. 

00:19:35
Can you bring that circle back. 

00:19:35
SAM STEEN You wanna bring the circle back. We will get to you. 

00:19:35
SHERI BAUMAN Well, well, at the end, let us finish, because we've something else, we're gonna do with these. So, I can tell that this was really painful and one of the reasons we're having this group is to make us all aware of how much these kinds of things hurt, so that we don't accidentally hurt someone else and I don't wanna leave us with all these prickly things. 

00:20:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:20:05
SHERI BAUMAN So, I'm gonna think about how we can heal, what are, what kinds of… (crosstalk)(inaudible)…excuse me. 

00:20:10
(Inaudible ). 

00:20:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well, kind of like, ah… what you can do to, to pull these out. What would… What would be your a reasonable thing like maybe with some, like sometimes someone was particularly nice to you or sometime that someone made you feel proud of yourself. You know what I mean? The kind of the opposite, that would allow us to pull these out. Do you want to say, share something with, Oligue. 

00:20:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ah… Maybe person forgave you. 

00:20:35
SAM STEEN For what. The person for… 

00:20:40
Tell sorry. 

00:20:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Forgave you. 

00:20:40
SAM STEEN Oh, oh… 

00:20:40
Forgive you. 

00:20:40
SHERI BAUMAN That you could… 

00:20:40
SAM STEEN You, so forgive the person who hurt you. So forgiveness, would you all agree with that. 

00:20:45
ALEX (ph) No. 

00:20:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I am like, you know, there is too, there is some that I can't forgive. 

00:20:50
SAM STEEN Really. Anybody else, that you would forgive the person. 

00:20:50
No, no there is some, I might not forgive like sorry, if they said (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:21:00
SAM STEEN Oh! (Crosstalk)(inaudible) apologize. 

00:21:00
Yeah, that's it. 

00:21:00
SAM STEEN So if someone say something hurtful to you and then they apologize, will that help you to feel better. 

00:21:05
No. 

00:21:10
SAM STEEN No? 

00:21:10
You wouldn't. 

00:21:10
SAM STEEN Well let's go back to the first one then, the for… the forgiveness. Sheri can you express a little, you are saying that. 

00:21:15
I don't mean to say that. 

00:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, but that returned out that it brought up two things, so there is… 

00:21:20
SAM STEEN Yeah, the apology. 

00:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN …apologizing and forgiveness. 

00:21:25
SAM STEEN Because I don't if we agree, that's what I'm, I'm curious. So if someone says something hurtful to you right, and we all feel pretty bad about some of the things that people done to us, right Daidge(ph). 

00:21:35
DAIDGE (ph) Uh…Huh… 

00:21:35
SAM STEEN And what if… What if we forgive them, like they don't even know we've forgiven them. Do you think that will make us feel better if we actually say, even though they said this about me, I am not gonna carry that around, I am not gonna let that bother me. Will that make me feel better? 

00:21:50
No. 

00:21:50
SAM STEEN Anybody. 

00:21:55
If they say sorry, then (crosstalk)(inaudible) forgive them. 

00:21:55
Forgive them. 

00:22:00
SAM STEEN So if they apologize, you're feeling like they'll, that you can forgive them, but if they don't. What if you never see that person again, can you still forgive them? Alex(ph) and Ileana(ph) said yes, what do you think Roman(ph)? 

00:22:10
ROMAN (ph) Well it depends, that fellow is really bad or the fellow is like not bad, feels like really bad, or not like bad, not like bad, but hurtful. 

00:22:20
SAM STEEN So it's still had to be hard for you, because I hear ah, Dordge(ph) is saying it would be difficult, Sheri you admit it to be difficult? 

00:22:25
SHERI BAUMAN But I had a thought about that, I want, I think it would be different if I didn't think they meant to her. You know like when someone says zip face to you, they're trying to hurt you. 

00:22:45
DORDGE (ph) (Inaudible ) they didn't say that. 

00:22:45
SHERI BAUMAN Excuse me. 

00:22:45
DORDGE (ph) Ah… Why would they say that? 

00:22:50
SHERI BAUMAN Because they're cool. 

00:22:50
SAM STEEN They being mean, you know. 

00:22:50
Or maybe because, somebody else did it to them. 

00:22:55
SAM STEEN Tease them, right. 

00:22:55
SHERI BAUMAN So instead of, and that's what I'm, instead of knowing how much you're hurt, so you wouldn't do it to someone else, they do the, they pass it on. 

00:23:05
SAM STEEN Yes. 

00:23:05
SHERI BAUMAN Umm… 

00:23:05
SAM STEEN But you are gonna say… 

00:23:10
SHERI BAUMAN So if, if someone accidentally said something, they didn't really mean to hurt me, maybe I could forgive them. 

00:23:15
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:23:15
SHERI BAUMAN But not if they sort of really wanted to do that. 

00:23:20
SAM STEEN But what you think Alex(ph) and Ileana, because I, I believe something slightly different, I am just curious, if you're thinking that too. You are saying, even if they don't know they hurt you or they did it on purpose, can you still forgive them? Tell us why you think so? 

00:23:35
ILEANA MEIN Ah, I can't forgive them because well they didn't mean to do it, so if they really did mean to do it then you know you would not forgive them. 

00:23:45
SAM STEEN So if they, if they did it on purpose, you still would, it still would hurt you and you couldn't say forgive them, I don't wanna let it go, it's so hold on to it. Is that the same for you Alex(ph) or what were you thinking? 

00:24:00
ALEX (ph) It's the same. 

00:24:00
SAM STEEN I guess I'll share what I was thinking, it's a little bit different that when people hurt us, whether they do it on purpose or accidentally, once they hurt you, they've already did their part, right. Now it's up to me, am I gonna let it hurt me, am I gonna carry that, or am I going to forgive them and just kind of forget about it. I am not saying it's easy, but I don't like to carry those things around. But that's just a way I look at it. So what else can we do? So one is that… 

00:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN I… 

00:24:35
SAM STEEN … if someone, sorry Sheri. 

00:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN No go ahead and finish it. 

00:24:35
SAM STEEN When as if someone apologizes to you will that eliminate one of this case, is that yes… 

00:24:40
SHERI BAUMAN …and each one of us is gonna be different. 

00:24:40
SAM STEEN So let's pull one out for them, do you agree with that? 

00:24:45
SHERI BAUMAN If, if you agree. 

00:24:45
SAM STEEN If you agree with that. What else, so apology may help to eliminate some of the pain. What else, we had two. Forgiveness for me will help to eliminate, like I chose to forgive that person even if they don't know about it. 

00:25:05
SHERI BAUMAN You know, I just had a thought, that I didn't realize before. I think I could, it wouldn't hurt me so much if I could say to the person, you know Rita(ph) it really hurt me, when you call me zip face, and I don't know if you meant it or not, but I want you to know it hurt, then I could take them out. 

00:25:25
SAM STEEN So if you can, like tell that person or communicate to them your feeling… 

00:25:30
SHERI BAUMAN Instead of just feeling bad and putting my head down and going away, if I could have stand up and say… 

00:25:35
SAM STEEN Would that be helpful, if you can communicate to the person how you feel. 

00:25:40
Yeah. 

00:25:40
SAM STEEN Yeah, I agree with that. 

00:25:40
SHERI BAUMAN And it might be for some and not for others. 

00:25:45
SAM STEEN What you think (inaudible ), what is one way you can get rid of one of them. 

00:25:45
Umm… come out. 

00:25:55
SAM STEEN Anybody? 

00:25:55
SHERI BAUMAN Give away. 

00:25:55
ROMAN (ph) Maybe if this like not that bad, you can like forget about it… 

00:25:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:26:00
ROMAN (ph) …and not like think about that anymore. 

00:26:00
SAM STEEN So just forget about it. 

00:26:00
ROMAN (ph) Yeah. 

00:26:00
SAM STEEN Will that work, Alex(ph)? 

00:26:05
ALEX (ph) Yes. 

00:26:05
SAM STEEN You said yes, meaning not for you (inaudible ). Any other ideas Daidge(ph), what we can do? 

00:26:15
DAIDGE (ph) I don't know. 

00:26:15
SHERI BAUMAN You kinda had an idea before and I think it might be a good one. Remember. 

00:26:25
DAIDGE (ph) Give them an I-message… 

00:26:25
SAM STEEN Wow… 

00:26:25
DAIDGE (ph) …that I don't like that… 

00:26:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:26:30
SAM STEEN …you are familiar with those the identity. 

00:26:30
Yes. 

00:26:30
SHERI BAUMAN Not saying you're a jerk, but I don't like being talked to like that. 

00:26:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… It's a great idea. 

00:26:35
SHERI BAUMAN Alex(ph) has an idea. 

00:26:40
ALEX (ph) You can talk to someone about it. 

00:26:40
SAM STEEN Wow… talk to someone else, like may be a friend and say this, it was hurtful to me. 

00:26:45
ALEX (ph) Yeah. 

00:26:45
SAM STEEN Or another adult. 

00:26:50
ALEX (ph) Or a counselor. 

00:26:50
SAM STEEN Or a counselor. Umm… 

00:26:50
Because(ph) I said. 

00:26:50
SAM STEEN Or your parents maybe? 

00:26:55
And it's brothers, sisters, siblings… 

00:26:55
SAM STEEN Umm… what else? 

00:27:00
SHERI BAUMAN You know, sometimes, I've had someone do something so nice, that it makes me forget something bad like… 

00:27:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:27:05
SHERI BAUMAN …I was telling Sam that I was at a school in Phoenix. One day, we simply and when I left, a kid in the class just came out and gave me a big hug. That like took, some of the hurtful sayings out, because it was so nice. 

00:27:25
SAM STEEN I would agree. 

00:27:25
I got all mine out. 

00:27:25
SHERI BAUMAN You are very good… 

00:27:30
I have another… 

00:27:30
SHERI BAUMAN You have another right, well so does Roman(ph) so. 

00:27:30
SAM STEEN Roman(ph). 

00:27:35
ROMAN (ph) Ah, and some people say this might not help or some people say like forgive and forget. 

00:27:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So, forgive and forget may help? 

00:27:40
ROMAN (ph) Yeah. 

00:27:40
SAM STEEN I agree with that one. 

00:27:40
SHERI BAUMAN All they had one and… 

00:27:45
Ah, you can… if the person apologizes and wanted to be your friend, so you can, so you can help out, so you can like talk about it. 

00:28:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:28:00
Get it on the system. 

00:28:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:28:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's a great idea, so if you don't just stop at the first thing, you keep talking. We're getting more ideas, this is great. 

00:28:10
ILEANA MEIN (ph) We can write a letter and email. 

00:28:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh… 

00:28:15
SAM STEEN To who? 

00:28:20
ILEANA MEIN (ph) To the person that said something to you. 

00:28:20
SAM STEEN I see, so you can write a letter to the person or an email to tell them how you felt. 

00:28:20
For the person who (inaudible ). 

00:28:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that would be a nice thing. Alex(ph). 

00:28:25
ALEX (ph) Ah, if somebody like, if you hurt that person say, just go play with someone else. 

00:28:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:28:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I decide I don't want to be around the people, who (inaudible ) you can put that way. 

00:28:40
SAM STEEN So you can find something else to do, is that right. Alex(ph) you had another idea. I like that idea. 

00:28:50
ALEX (ph) You could write, write it down, somewhere and then just get it out of your head. 

00:28:55
SHERI BAUMAN And just sometimes it doesn't work. 

00:29:00
SAM STEEN But her ideas are good one, it doesn't always look good, so you can maybe write it on journal or something like that yeah, right. Sheri did you hear that idea… 

00:29:05
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:29:05
SAM STEEN …maybe write it in the journal or write it somewhere. 

00:29:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:29:10
SAM STEEN Any of these. 

00:29:10
SHERI BAUMAN I think these are great ideas. 

00:29:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Any, any… 

00:29:15
SHERI BAUMAN I… I wasn't, I think I still have one or two, do you have one more, can we think of anything, couple of (inaudible ) you have three, did you take them out when you thought of your ideas so. 

00:29:25
SAM STEEN Let's just (inaudible ). You said yeah. 

00:29:35
SHERI BAUMAN You know, it may be that sometimes one or two stick with us, but this is a lot better than when it started ah, when we were all prickly and so forth. So… 

00:29:45
SAM STEEN What about listening to music, does that help. 

00:29:45
Oh yeah, sometimes. 

00:29:45
Yeah. 

00:29:45
SAM STEEN Sometimes right. 

00:29:50
SHERI BAUMAN I just had another idea. You guys, have kind of sparked my thinking, so let's say, let my feeling were hurt when I was ten, because someone says that to me, and I can't do anything about that now, because, I don't, I don't even know where this person is, but I hear someone say that to someone else and I say, don't do that, it really hurts someone for a long time. So I might not have a chance to say it then, but I could stand up when other people are hurt now. 

00:30:20
ALEX (ph) I think so. 

00:30:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. 

00:30:20
SAM STEEN Oh, yeah. 

00:30:20
SHERI BAUMAN I think that would help me get rid of some these. What about you Roman(ph). 

00:30:25
ROMAN (ph) Ah, may be like write a letter like, like a bad letter, but don't send it to them. 

00:30:30
SAM STEEN Oh… 

00:30:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, you get it out, but you don't have to… 

00:30:35
SAM STEEN Really send it. Because you ever heard that saying two wrongs don't make a right. 

00:30:40
Uh…Huh… 

00:30:40
SAM STEEN And so it doesn't mean you have to go and be lean back them. Well, we almost have them all out, we just have one more, any last ideas. Umm… 

00:30:50
Kind of punishing yourself on it. 

00:30:55
SAM STEEN Punishing yourself? 

00:30:55
SHERI BAUMAN What, how do you punish yourself. 

00:30:55
Tell their parent. 

00:31:00
SAM STEEN Your parent? 

00:31:00
Their parent. 

00:31:00
SAM STEEN What do you mean? 

00:31:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, I know what you are, I think I know what you mean. 

00:31:05
Tell them that their parent what they said to you, or… 

00:31:10
SAM STEEN Will that help? 

00:31:10
…or if they heard. 

00:31:10
SAM STEEN So may be telling them they don't or telling their parents, so they can take care of it. Yeah, it depends on what it is to you, right. 

00:31:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, you wanna parent to teach them how to treat other people, so that would be, will be that's a scary, but it's a really good one. Anybody else… we have Oligue(ph) and Alex(ph). 

00:31:35
I want to take this out but it just… 

00:31:35
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, okay, so… 

00:31:35
SAM STEEN Oh, so you be… 

00:31:35
SHERI BAUMAN …Alex(ph) we help you (inaudible ) and the Ileana(ph) each have one thorn left in their selves. Do you have any ideas how we could done it… 

00:31:50
Don't be afraid of people, just, if you know them they… they won't bother you, they won't do anything. 

00:32:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's all. 

00:32:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) A little. 

00:32:00
SHERI BAUMAN A little, okay. 

00:32:05
ALEX (ph) Just tell that person, I don't like what you said to me. 

00:32:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So stand up to that person, is that right? Or, one I just thought, and I think you're saying it is be confident in who you are, or be comfortable with who you are, so even when people try to attach you and then it doesn't mean that it has to hurt you. You can be brave and stand up to it. Is that… is that right? 

00:32:30
SHERI BAUMAN So we all heal those really hard wounds. 

00:32:35
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:32:35
SHERI BAUMAN And you guys came up with some terrific ideas, and you know what (inaudible ) I can't even tell that I was hurt. 

00:32:45
SAM STEEN We will give it. 

00:32:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, you got one more. 

00:32:45
SAM STEEN So let's do one more activity before… 

00:32:45
SHERI BAUMAN Before, before, and what was it like to do this. This was hard. I had to say some horrible words. 

00:32:55
Uh…Huh… 

00:32:55
SHERI BAUMAN And we had to hear some and some feeling were hurt. 

00:33:00
Is there any nice words kinda something like. 

00:33:00
SAM STEEN Yeah, we are gonna to do that in a second. 

00:33:05
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… But ah, you know in terms of taking risk and learning more about appreciating differences in people, what do we learn from this, what do you think. You don't raise your hands, just jump in. 

00:33:20
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Ah, to say(ph) that for yourself and be who you are. 

00:33:25
SHERI BAUMAN That's one. 

00:33:25
ALEX (ph) And don't let a person ah, make fun of you. 

00:33:30
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:33:30
ROMAN (ph) Be confident. 

00:33:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:33:30
SHERI BAUMAN Great. 

00:33:35
Ah, fix the problem if you can. 

00:33:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:33:35
SHERI BAUMAN Alex(ph) you have any other? 

00:33:40
ALEX (ph) Ah, stand up for other person. 

00:33:40
SHERI BAUMAN That's what I think was really wonderful, just for yourself, but also for others, because that may, that's the one that when you said that I could take this out, great. I really admire your willingness to do something so hard. You guys are really amazing. 

00:34:00
SAM STEEN What's that, was that, was that kind of difficult to do? 

00:34:00
Uh… Huh. 

00:34:00
SAM STEEN You think that was the hardest thing we've done so far? 

00:34:05
Yeah. 

00:34:05
SAM STEEN You think so. 

00:34:05
SHERI BAUMAN What? 

00:34:05
SAM STEEN And Roman(ph) said can we get back the comfort zone, where you think in you would have moved yours. 

00:34:10
SHERI BAUMAN Which way. 

00:34:10
SAM STEEN Which way it? 

00:34:10
ROMAN (ph) To move out of the risk what… 

00:34:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:34:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that was a big risk for… 

00:34:15
Yeah… 

00:34:15
SHERI BAUMAN All of us. 

00:34:15
(inaudible ). 

00:34:20
SHERI BAUMAN And I am very impressed that, that we must have created a very safe and we I mean all of us, had to feel pretty safe to take the risks. 

00:34:25
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:34:30
SHERI BAUMAN So you guys did a great job. 

00:34:30
SAM STEEN What we wanted, since you know, we did that and it was kind of challenging, we want to try the compliments again. So that we can all leave on a positive note. So one person starts and you say that person's name, I want to give a compliment to whoever and then you get the compliment and then they pick someone else. 

00:34:45
SHERI BAUMAN And let's try, yeah, let's try looking at them and saying it right to them. 

00:34:50
SAM STEEN So whoever wants to start can start. 

00:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN Dordge(ph)? 

00:34:55
DORDGE (ph) Umm… I gonna give it to ah, Alex(ph) again because, ah, she actually… 

00:35:05
SAM STEEN Say you. 

00:35:05
DORDGE (ph) What? 

00:35:05
SAM STEEN Say, you actually… 

00:35:10
DORDGE (ph) …you actually ah, told about your feeling wise and how you can ah, fix it. 

00:35:20
ALEX (ph) Alright, I, I wanna give a compliment to Ileana(ph) because, you ah, expressed your feelings. 

00:35:40
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Thank you. I wanna give a compliment to Sheri because, you took all fear, ah, hurtful comments and stuff like that out of you. 

00:35:55
SHERI BAUMAN Thanks. 

00:35:55
ILEANA MEIN (ph) And you told why. 

00:36:00
SHERI BAUMAN Thank you. Daidge(ph), I wanna compliment you, because you kind of early on thought about good things kinda help and you anticipated that we were gonna not just leave everybody all wounded, so thank you for that. 

00:36:15
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
DAIDGE (ph) Ah, I can't think… 

00:36:25
SAM STEEN There is Roman(ph), Oligue(ph), or me. Okay, Dordge(ph) she goes, we get her left, because, she started. Don't worry… 

00:36:40
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:50
DAIDGE (ph) Thank you… 

00:36:55
SAM STEEN Think somebody first, and then we will help you come up with one. 

00:37:00
DAIDGE (ph) Roman(ph) because… 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
SAM STEEN Anybody have ideas about Roman(ph). 

00:37:10
SHERI BAUMAN A hint for Daidge(ph) to tell about Roman(ph). 

00:37:15
SAM STEEN Go ahead Alex(ph). Alex(ph) has a hint for you Daidge(ph). 

00:37:15
ALEX (ph) Because, umm, he, he, he told, he told us like, some ways to get over your anger. 

00:37:25
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… You wanna look at Roman(ph) and tell him that. 

00:37:25
DAIDGE (ph) Ah, you because as, you told, ah, you're actually giving ideas and stuff. 

00:37:35
ROMAN (ph) Thank you. Ah, I want to give a compliment to Sam because, he seems like a strong person that can handle a lot of things. 

00:37:45
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:37:45
ROMAN (ph) Like anger, or something that hurt. 

00:37:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:37:50
ROMAN (ph) And he seems really nice. 

00:37:50
SAM STEEN Thank you. That it feels really good to hear you say that. Ah, is it Oligue(ph). I want to give a compliment to Oligue(ph). Oligue(ph) ah, you are very thoughtful, when you responded like, you listen and you think for longer and then you share your feelings and I think that's really helpful for us to hear. 

00:38:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Thank you. Ah, I like Dordge(ph) because, she didn't laugh. 

00:38:20
SAM STEEN You… 

00:38:20
SHERI BAUMAN Can you say you. 

00:38:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) She didn't, you didn't laugh like me, and I thought someone of the words were funny but then I realized it was good. 

00:38:35
SAM STEEN And what you say? 

00:38:35
DORDGE (ph) Thank you. 

00:38:35
SAM STEEN It's really good to hear that too. 

00:38:40
SHERI BAUMAN Thank you everyone. 

00:38:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So before, any last thing you wanna say before we end this session. 

00:38:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Yeah, this is a horrible… 

00:38:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. 

00:38:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) This is a hard session. 

00:38:50
SHERI BAUMAN I agree, but… 

00:38:55
ROMAN (ph) I think this is the hardest. 

00:38:55
SAM STEEN You think so. Alex(ph) you had your hand out. 

00:39:00
ALEX (ph) Ah, can we moved our, our… 

00:39:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Risks. 

00:39:00
ALEX (ph) …yeah, risks. 

00:39:05
SAM STEEN It because yes, when we finish… 

00:39:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, you want to do that. 

00:39:05
SAM STEEN …when we finish, you can go move it and then we will see unless anybody had anything else they want to say. 

00:39:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ah, next week it is easier. 

00:39:10
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… 

00:39:10
SAM STEEN It will be easier. 

00:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN It will, we put this in the middle, so that we could end with it. 

00:39:15
SAM STEEN And that's so hard. 

00:39:15
SHERI BAUMAN And, and we'll get back to some of things that are… 

00:39:20
SAM STEEN So complete your evaluations again. Move your, ah, person or whatever you want to call it on the comfort zone and we will see you next week. 

00:39:25
SHERI BAUMAN And thanks for taking such a big risk. 

00:39:30
SAM STEEN Yes. 

00:39:35
Discussion 

00:39:40
SAM STEEN Where do you want to start on this one? 

00:39:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ah, yeah well. That was tough for them, but I was just gone away by a couple of the insights they had. 

00:39:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:50
SHERI BAUMAN And their willingness, they were like, did you see where they moved their risks to someone who put it off in the paper… 

00:39:55
SAM STEEN I hadn't seen it. 

00:39:55
SHERI BAUMAN …you know they just, they said… 

00:39:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:39:55
SHERI BAUMAN …well I really took a big risk to talk about such a difficult stuff. I'm actually glad we came up with a way to heal those. 

00:40:05
SAM STEEN Absolutely. 

00:40:05
SHERI BAUMAN It would be horrible to leave them hanging like that. What do you think, do you think this was too hard for them or it too intense. 

00:40:10
SAM STEEN I don't think it was too intense, I think the timing was good. 

00:40:15
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:15
SAM STEEN We had established a sort of a feel good atmosphere, the one before we kept, repeating the message over and over and then finally, ah, we told. But we allowed them to, we, you kinda gave them a heads up this might be the toughest one. And I think they responded well. Ah… But definitely difficult and having them, I don't know, if you added this or we both did, to, to not talk while we do it, kinda add it to it, you know. 

00:40:45
SHERI BAUMAN I thought it was interesting that, the way that laughter which I agree was probably nervous laughter… 

00:40:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… 

00:40:50
SHERI BAUMAN …but it was interesting that they, chose on their own… 

00:40:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:55
SHERI BAUMAN …to say that's not okay. 

00:40:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:40:55
SHERI BAUMAN And, Oligue's(ph) apology essentially for that… 

00:41:00
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:41:00
SHERI BAUMAN …was wow. 

00:41:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… Yes, absolutely. And they self-monitored. You know, we didn't have to say, don't laugh, or even take for example the ball falling, you know, ha ha… they… they kinda. 

00:41:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right, they seemed to whereas in the previous ones, we, we did a lot of giggly stuff… 

00:41:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:41:20
SHERI BAUMAN …with our potato friends here, I mean, I could (inaudible ) and saying, oh, my head hurts, you know, because they dropped themselves or whatever. 

00:41:25
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:41:25
SHERI BAUMAN They seem to say with… 

00:41:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… 

00:41:30
SHERI BAUMAN …they recognized the importance or the weightiness of this session. 

00:41:35
SAM STEEN Did you think that element of multiculturalism was infused in that activity. Because I know, it's hard to ah, to be specific about it. Because, some of the hurtful things, can be related to bulling or teasing or, or things of that nature. Ah… But in terms of celebrating diversity did you see, how it was connected. 

00:41:55
SHERI BAUMAN You know, I think so, but we might ask them that. 

00:42:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:42:00
SHERI BAUMAN How about we ask them that at the beginning of the next session, just before we move along ah, what, what do you think, why do you think we chose such a, to include such a… 

00:42:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:42:10
SHERI BAUMAN …difficult activity. 

00:42:15
SAM STEEN That might be a good idea, even if it's not just for that part of it, but just again their reactions to that type of activity, before we move on to the next one. You think? 

00:42:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I think so. It would say, you know something else that's interesting to me is, is they seemed very tolerant of Daidge's(ph) physicalness. 

00:42:35
SAM STEEN Umm…Umm… 

00:42:35
SHERI BAUMAN And I am glad, because then we don't have to be distracted by… 

00:42:40
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:42:40
SHERI BAUMAN …sit still because we obviously… 

00:42:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… 

00:42:40
SHERI BAUMAN …doesn't sit-still, very long it seem to me. 

00:42:45
SAM STEEN I was impressed about how open and honest they were. I mean, they really were, they, they were very genuine in, in their responses. 

00:42:50
SHERI BAUMAN Some of their little faces… 

00:42:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:42:55
SHERI BAUMAN …when their anger and hurt was… 

00:42:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… 

00:42:55
SHERI BAUMAN And the good, you know what it was good news that had to read the script, I couldn't see as many. 

00:43:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:43:00
SHERI BAUMAN I hate that script. 

00:43:00
SAM STEEN Well I wanted to commend you, I was gonna do it in the session, but it's probably more appropriate here, ah, because I didn't have the chance to compliment you, but that, it was very difficult for you and I know the script, at least the activity and you save the work nigger to the end. Was that one of the most challenging ones to say, I saw you. It's like I picked up on the body language. But I commend you for even being able to, to say that, you know. 

00:43:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I couldn't thought if we're… 

00:43:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:43:30
SHERI BAUMAN …if we are doing this, but yuck… 

00:43:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… And like you said, we didn't just leave them there, then we began to think about the ways that they can hopefully take with them that they already knew ah, to kinda combat some of those things. And one of your ideas had a hint of advocacy in there what you were saying may be something happened to you a long time ago, but now you in turn help. Someone else who may be dealing with something very similar. 

00:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN But you know one of the kids said that. 

00:44:00
SAM STEEN Oh, I thought it was you. 

00:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I said it, but I was really restating, they had… 

00:44:05
SAM STEEN Interesting. 

00:44:05
SHERI BAUMAN …kind of an idea that if you hear something… 

00:44:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:44:05
SHERI BAUMAN …you can standup not just for yours I think Alex(ph) said it. 

00:44:10
SAM STEEN Ah, you're right, you're right. 

00:44:10
SHERI BAUMAN Not just for yourself, but you can stand up for someone else… 

00:44:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:44:10
SHERI BAUMAN …and I thought, well that is a way. 

00:44:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:44:15
SHERI BAUMAN Ah, and you know, I don't know about you but as a leader of this is tough (inaudible ) I am a human being what's… 

00:44:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:44:20
SHERI BAUMAN …you know, and I am not using that example lightly. 

00:44:25
SAM STEEN Umm… 

00:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN I mean that hurt and I remember her name and it's… 

00:44:30
SAM STEEN You're, you've said… 

00:44:30
SHERI BAUMAN 50 or some years ago. 

00:44:30
SAM STEEN …you said Rita(ph), was that the name. 

00:44:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, and I'll tell you her last name too. 

00:44:30
SAM STEEN Ha… ha… ha… that's okay. What about, there was a point time where I feel like, I had a strong reaction to um, the forgiveness thing. I don't know if you picked up on that. And I think it's just a personal belief, but I kinda totally down and I was curious and I was reading the body language and the only two who seem in and it could be because of, who I could see directly. Alex(ph) and Ileana(ph) seem like they wanted to say yeah, forgiveness is okay, but they were little hesitate. Ileana(ph) gave an example so it kinda confirm that she didn't really necessarily grew my perspective. Um, but I did feel comfortable sharing it, and, and I'm just wanted to get sort of a sense, didn't you feel like I was being forceful with that or… 

00:45:15
SHERI BAUMAN Not at all. I thought it was very, very helpful. 

00:45:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:45:15
SHERI BAUMAN It was interesting, I mean, I don't know but… you but… I picked up some faces, there are some kids here who have been wounded big time. 

00:45:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… Oh, absolutely. It was very real. 

00:45:25
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:45:25
SAM STEEN And, what also kinda gave me confirmation, or affirmation was, umm, in terms of just that whole discussion of forgiveness. I know there is a spiritual twist to it. Um, but it's just a personal belief was that Roman(ph) said later, you can forgive and forget. 

00:45:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:45:45
SAM STEEN So that is a message that it is okay… 

00:45:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, yeah. 

00:45:45
SAM STEEN …to forgive someone, you know and because… 

00:45:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. No, I thought that was very… 

00:45:50
SAM STEEN …and he had to carry that around, you know… 

00:45:50
SHERI BAUMAN No, I don't. 

00:45:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… And then one of them almost say that… the things they picked up on was just being comfortable with who you are… 

00:45:55
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:45:55
SAM STEEN So maybe it wasn't a cultural thing, but just an, a sense of empowerment for themselves. 

00:46:00
SHERI BAUMAN And but who they are is sort of its like total human being… 

00:46:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh…Uh…Huh… 

00:46:05
SHERI BAUMAN …which includes that. 

00:46:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:46:05
SHERI BAUMAN That's that was, that was, so in terms of where do we go from here… 

00:46:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:46:10
SHERI BAUMAN …I think we need to lightened up a little bit in next session, ah… 

00:46:15
SAM STEEN Do you think? 

00:46:15
SHERI BAUMAN Not and not tremendously, but I think this is clearly the most painful. So I think ah,… 

00:46:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:46:20
SHERI BAUMAN …but we've opened the can of worms and I, as they said, they, they want to shot that you know… They're across the room from their circle. 

00:46:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:46:30
SHERI BAUMAN That was a big risk for them, even though… 

00:46:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:46:30
SHERI BAUMAN They didn't give individual examples. They didn't have do somehow. 

00:46:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… I agree that the group is working very well. 

00:46:35
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:46:40
SAM STEEN But in terms of lighting enough we did, if you look at it, it still has this element of… 

00:46:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:46:45
SAM STEEN How you feel, but it does. It's not as visual. 

00:46:45
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:46:50
SAM STEEN Umm… It's more of a reflective. You, you understand it… 

00:46:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:46:50
SAM STEEN And it's not as tangible, I mean that's very tangible, you could hear the pins and you know the thing going into the ball. 

00:46:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:46:55
SAM STEEN Anyhow, um, so… 

00:47:00
SHERI BAUMAN Halfway and very exciting. 

00:47:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Alright keep up the good work. Ha ha ha… 

00:47:10
Session 4 

00:47:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, um, right at the end of last session, there was a lot of movement on this and we didn't get a chance to talk about it, so I am wondering if you would like to share where you moved your stew and why. Um… how about this time to make it easy, we just go around the circle. Would that be okay and you can start Roman(ph). 

00:47:35
ROMAN (ph) I move mine out of the circle… 

00:47:40
SHERI BAUMAN And which, which one are you? 

00:47:40
ROMAN (ph) Mine's the green one. 

00:47:40
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:47:40
ROMAN (ph) I move mine out of the circle because, on the last one we were talking about the difference and then proper words, and it kind of made me feel like a little bit uncomfortable. 

00:47:55
ALEX (ph) Um… I'm the black one and I moved mine almost, almost up the paper because, umm, in the last session we were talking about, I mainly feel uncomfortable. 

00:48:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And, mine is the brown one. Mine also went almost off the paper, because the third session was uncomfortable for me and it's hard. 

00:48:20
SAM STEEN But… but you are willing to take a risk. I didn't move mine. Yes, I just, same, the same thing. I would say, I was right at the edge of my comfort level. It was something that we talked about um, the part above ah, forgiveness, and you know that was something that really was hard for me, um, to kinda express and um, but and… and the other part it was to see you all kind of share some of those things. I can tell that it was difficult for some of you and so that, it made me feel like, I was taking a risk as well. 

00:49:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Mine is the white one and I moved mine out of the circle, because I was uncomfortable and I was risking what I want to. 

00:49:10
DAIDGE (ph) Mine is the brown one. I mean ah, the orange one and I moved mine out of the circle, because I was uncomfortable with what we were doing. 

00:49:20
SHERI BAUMAN And all of you did it in any way which is really, that's what courage is, if you're not, you know, you can be brave if you wanted to scared or uncomfortable. I would put mine like way out there, because I had to say those horrible things, and that felt awful, because that's exactly the opposite of how I try to be and what I believe. So for that part of it I was way out there. And Sam and I talked about that was really nervous, but I also felt like some of the things we talked about were hard. 

00:50:00
SAM STEEN Dordge(ph)?. 

00:50:00
DORDGE (ph) Mine is the blue one. Um, the words that we heard it tore me apart, because I didn't really like it and it wasn't really that funny, because when the words you don't know, you don't, you are not really supposed to laugh if you don't know what it is. 

00:50:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:50:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. So you could tell from the way I said, and even if you don't know that, what they were, that they weren't nice, right. Yeah. Okay. 

00:50:25
SAM STEEN Well, thank you for sharing. 

00:50:30
SHERI BAUMAN You people can leave this here rather than this… 

00:50:30
SAM STEEN You want to just leave it there. 

00:50:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Umm…Yeah. 

00:50:35
SAM STEEN Okay. Let's do another activity. It's a little bit easier, but it is something that, not only do you have to think about how you feel about certain situation. Are you trying to get a snap, I can see your hand and I know you're working them… 

00:50:45
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha… 

00:50:50
SAM STEEN Do you want some water? 

00:50:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:50
SAM STEEN Not only do you have to share how you feel about the certain thing, but also what you would do in that situation. And then we are gonna give you the opportunity to ask someone else how do you think. They would feel about that situation. Okay, so I am gonna read a couple of things. 

00:51:05
SHERI BAUMAN And while you are getting your things to read. 

00:51:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:51:10
SHERI BAUMAN I want to give you an example, did you ever hear the expression don't judge another person until you've walked a mile in their shoes. 

00:51:15
Uh…Huh… 

00:51:15
SHERI BAUMAN Do you ever heard that? Okay, so, I am gonna say it again, so you can really think about it. Don't judge someone else until you've walked a mile in their shoes. 

00:51:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I think I… 

00:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think. 

00:51:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …understand of… 

00:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think it means? 

00:51:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Um, don't judge a person, if we don't know what it's like to be them. 

00:51:40
SHERI BAUMAN Perfect. 

00:51:40
SAM STEEN Great. 

00:51:45
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Cannot judge them until you know who they really are inside. 

00:51:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right, because it's really easy to judge someone, but if, when and when you walked a mile in their shoes in other words, when you've been there, I mean know who they are, but that changes things, kinda like it changed our potatoes when they had a personality and they weren't just a potato, why are you scratching (inaudible ) okay, so that's kind of the, the purpose of this is to give us a chance to walk, I mean a mile and maybe a half mile, on someone shoes and imagine what it would feel like. Okay. 

00:52:20
SAM STEEN Alright, so just imagine that you are hanging out with some kids at school during lunch time, and you hear some other kids talk about another group and they say Mein(ph) things about, about another group, so they say racist things about a group. Um… How would you feel and what would you do. Umm… 

00:52:45
ROMAN (ph) If that wouldn't happen I would have (inaudible ) or something someone that could help that moment going up. 

00:52:50
SAM STEEN So, you… 

00:52:50
ROMAN (ph) Someone gets better. 

00:52:50
SAM STEEN …you would tell somebody to help you. 

00:52:55
ROMAN (ph) Yeah, someone adult, because if you tell like a child, they won't pretty much do anything because they can't do it. 

00:53:00
SAM STEEN Other than how would you feel? 

00:53:00
ROMAN (ph) I'd feel pretty bad, because, that's not really nice. 

00:53:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… And so if you think a moment, are you care (inaudible ), anybody else might feel about that or what they would do in that case? 

00:53:15
ROMAN (ph) May be… 

00:53:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Who could you ask? 

00:53:20
ROMAN (ph) How about you? 

00:53:20
SAM STEEN How about you?. If I over here then, well, I don't necessarily play with kids at lunch, after school, going to school. But I have… 

00:53:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh…Huh… What about when you were a kid? 

00:53:30
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

00:53:35
SAM STEEN Little, when I was kid. Umm… I think um, I probably would have to really ask for some help on that one. And I think, I would also do another thing, it depends on what they said, I may go over there and ask them to maybe a little bit nicer, but I've also you know, kinda something similar at work, where you hear, people talking about or saying some things that are hurtful and um… I'm not always that brave at going over there to talk to the adult as an adult. But it's something that does, and I do think about. Oligue(ph)? 

00:54:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) My mom told me about her time, where she was on work and other people, who were talking about her… 

00:54:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:54:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …many things about her. 

00:54:20
SAM STEEN About her background or just about her, just anything about her? 

00:54:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Like. 

00:54:25
SAM STEEN Like being Russian or anything? 

00:54:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Like what she doesn't want. 

00:54:35
SAM STEEN Oh, I see. 

00:54:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) She is not a good character and… 

00:54:35
SAM STEEN Oh, Uh…Huh… 

00:54:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …hard worker. 

00:54:40
SAM STEEN About how she works, just few things. 

00:54:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Umm… 

00:54:40
SAM STEEN And does she talk about how she handled it and what she did, or she just shared how she felt. 

00:54:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) She just shared. 

00:54:50
SAM STEEN You are gonna say something. 

00:54:55
SHERI BAUMAN Change in mind. Okay. 

00:54:55
SAM STEEN How about we try another one. Thanks for asking. Do you want to try another one? Okay. Umm… Let's say it's the first day of class and the teacher mispronounces your name and everyone in the class starts to laugh. 

00:55:15
DORDGE (ph) All the time. 

00:55:15
SHERI BAUMAN You found that happen then? 

00:55:20
SAM STEEN So how do you feel or how have you felt and what do you do or did you do? Let Dordge(ph) go first and then… 

00:55:25
DORDGE (ph) I don't feel like tell them… people know how to say my name, because, sometimes people say Torje(ph) and the other stuff and when they get it wrong, I just tell 'em it's Dordge(ph). 

00:55:45
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN So you stand up and make it real clear. Even if it's a teacher. Good for you. 

00:55:50
SAM STEEN Are you wondering maybe how Ileana(ph) thinks about that or what she thinks about that? 

00:55:55
DORDGE (ph) Umm… Yeah. 

00:55:55
SAM STEEN Go ahead. 

00:55:55
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Well, umm… In the beginning of this year, my teacher actually spelled my name wrong, um, and I told him how to just pronounce… 

00:56:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:56:05
ILEANA MEIN (ph) And that's all I had to say. 

00:56:10
SAM STEEN Did he had, he… he did… he took care of it. So if you didn't say anything he may never changed it. Umm… Go ahead Oligue(ph). 

00:56:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Um, when… when someone mispronounces my name, to say, um, in Russian, or in English, I think in mind what if, what if you were in my shoes, what if, what if were after you, if someone else, mispronounce your name. 

00:56:45
SAM STEEN So that's your response to someone who does that. How would you feel if… 

00:56:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh…Huh… with just in my head. 

00:56:55
SAM STEEN Oh, just in your mind. So how do you feel about it, I, I understand what you do, how do you feel about it. 

00:57:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I feel bad for myself, or if it's someone else I feel bad for them. 

00:57:05
SAM STEEN Bad for that person too. Let's try another one. Your friends are mostly of the same race or background or culture as yourself. You made friends with someone else, who is not like you, they're different. 

00:57:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And that's the good thing. 

00:57:25
SAM STEEN I think, it's a good thing to you. 

00:57:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) If, if there is a friend that, exactly like you, everything would be boring. 

00:57:30
SAM STEEN Everything would be boring. 

00:57:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, like. 

00:57:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Thing would be boring. 

00:57:35
SHERI BAUMAN Really it would be (inaudible ). 

00:57:35
SAM STEEN But let's say, some of your other friends are happy about it or your parents get mad about it, how do you feel and what would you do? 

00:57:50
ROMAN (ph) Well, I feel kind of bad about that, and I will say they are my friends, because I like them for who they are. 

00:57:55
SHERI BAUMAN And you would stand up… 

00:58:00
ROMAN (ph) Yeah. 

00:58:00
SHERI BAUMAN …to your other friends and say, I am going to be friends with you all. And what if they said, well won't be your friend anymore if you are hanging out with that person. 

00:58:05
ROMAN (ph) And I will say that's fun with me. 

00:58:05
SAM STEEN Umm… Wow, and Dordge(ph) you had any question for him, oh you didn't say. 

00:58:15
DORDGE (ph) I wasn't like to say anything. 

00:58:15
SAM STEEN Oh, I thought, I made you say that same type to share your stuff, I'm sorry. 

00:58:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I want to say something about friendship to. 

00:58:20
SAM STEEN Go ahead. 

00:58:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And instead of saying that direct with me or… I'd say, ah, I would say, what you have other friends and what if I'm not your friend anymore. 

00:58:40
SAM STEEN Umm… 

00:58:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Because you have other friends… 

00:58:45
SAM STEEN So what… 

00:58:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And I can have other friends, because it's a my country. 

00:58:45
SAM STEEN Umm… So you're, you're able to chose your friends. Uh…Huh… 

00:58:50
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I'd say to my parents that I can choose my friends, because not me, it's my friends. 

00:59:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… But I'm glad you about that. Would it be easier or more difficult to have that conversation with your friends or your parents. 

00:59:10
ALEX (ph) Oh yeah, parents. 

00:59:10
Parents. 

00:59:10
SAM STEEN It seem more difficult or easier? 

00:59:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) It's difficult. 

00:59:15
ALEX (ph) Harder. 

00:59:15
SAM STEEN Why it's so that. Why, or why… 

00:59:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I (inaudible ) in charge of. 

00:59:20
SAM STEEN I am sorry. Alex(ph) first and then you could go. 

00:59:25
ALEX (ph) Because like, coz they're your parents and well they could tell you what to do but… but they're friends so you want to have friends that you pick. 

00:59:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… because your friends they didn't do anything wrong, just by being different from you. Oligue(ph), what were you gonna say? 

00:59:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) It's harder for to talk to your parents, because you can't… you can't argue with them a lot, you can't argue with them. 

00:59:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) But you can't… you can't even stand up to them… 

00:59:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

00:59:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And maybe they… they won't be there… 

00:59:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… it's that something you believe in it. 

01:00:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh…Huh… 

01:00:00
ROMAN (ph) But I would also say to my friends that if you guys are that rude, I don't want to be friends with you. 

01:00:10
SAM STEEN Umm… 

01:00:10
SHERI BAUMAN And you know what I heard you say that very beginning and I can't remember if it's the first sessions of this session after that you said, it doesn't matter what someone looks like. It's what kind of personality they have so, it sounds like when you learn they have the kind of personality that… 

01:00:25
Uh…Huh… 

01:00:25
SHERI BAUMAN …makes those kind of racist comments that you learned something that's gonna change things good for you. 

01:00:35
SAM STEEN Daidge(ph) can I ask you this question? 

01:00:35
DAIDGE (ph) Uh…Huh… 

01:00:40
SAM STEEN Your friends invite you over for dinner. 

01:00:40
SHERI BAUMAN Imagine that. Ha ha… 

01:00:45
SAM STEEN And the food is, the food that you're having is kinda weird looking, like you don't really seen it before and everyone else starts eating. How do you feel and what would you do? 

01:01:00
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… I feel, I don't know, ah, I kinda feel bad because they made me food and I'm not gonna eat it. 

01:01:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:01:15
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha… 

01:01:15
DAIDGE (ph) But at the same time, I don't want to eat that food… 

01:01:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:01:20
DAIDGE (ph) …that's weird. 

01:01:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:01:20
DAIDGE (ph) …and I'm a big eater. 

01:01:25
SHERI BAUMAN So for you that's really. 

01:01:25
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… And so what do you do in that situation. 

01:01:30
DAIDGE (ph) Ah, tell them I don't feel good, I don't know. 

01:01:35
SAM STEEN Good. 

01:01:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ah… 

01:01:35
DAIDGE (ph) Tell my stomach hurts. 

01:01:35
SHERI BAUMAN There… but that's interesting comment isn't it. 

01:01:40
DORDGE (ph) They will give you milk, what if they give you medicine. 

01:01:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha… But let's think for a minute, why would he say, my stomach hurts or I don't feel good instead of saying this food is weird and I don't want it. 

01:01:50
DAIDGE (ph) Because it's rude. 

01:01:50
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:01:50
SHERI BAUMAN So you would be respectful, but you would find a way to… that was very clever. 

01:01:55
SAM STEEN Pick somebody else to, to, to tell us. 

01:02:00
SHERI BAUMAN Alex. 

01:02:00
ALEX (ph) If I didn't like the food, if it look weird to me, I would try it before telling the people and I, I don't want to be rude and just tell them I don't want this food, because it looks weird. 

01:02:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… So you take the risk and try it? 

01:02:20
ALEX (ph) Yeah. Ileana(ph) , do you think he is right. 

01:02:20
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I think same as him. 

01:02:20
SAM STEEN The same thing. Ah, Dordge(ph). 

01:02:25
DORDGE (ph) Ah, just the same thing, but um, I wouldn't really eat it, I would tell them that, I would, I already ate at home. 

01:02:35
SAM STEEN Umm… So you are not hungry. 

01:02:35
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

01:02:35
SAM STEEN And you Roman(ph). 

01:02:40
ROMAN (ph) According to like what Daidge(ph) said, it sound like really a lie about his stomach hurts, it's like a white lie, so like something that you don't want to do you have to do… 

01:02:45
DAIDGE (ph) (inaudible ) I said my approach. 

01:02:45
ROMAN (ph) But you wanted to be a, yeah, and you… 

01:02:50
SAM STEEN Just in case, have you ever tried? 

01:02:50
ROMAN (ph) … rude about it either. 

01:02:50
SAM STEEN You don't have to be rude about. Have you ever try something that doesn't look really good and then you tastes that and it ends something okay. 

01:03:00
Yeah. 

01:03:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. That's sort of taking a risk is… 

01:03:00
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:03:00
SHERI BAUMAN You need to try something unusual and some of them turn out to be yummy! 

01:03:05
SAM STEEN Oligue(ph) what would you say? 

01:03:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I want to ask something about Dordge(ph), she… she said, she said I had already ate at home, but what if they, what if, did you say invite to them. 

01:03:15
SAM STEEN Oh, yeah. 

01:03:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) What if the parents are at home, they are doing something at home or work. 

01:03:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:03:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And, and then when, and then the, the person who invited me, um, ask the parents, tells the parent that, that Dordge(ph) said, after she said that. 

01:03:40
SAM STEEN Ha ha… 

01:03:45
DORDGE (ph) He get so serious. 

01:03:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) That she already told, and if the parents saying she didn't, she didn't… 

01:03:50
SAM STEEN It's like hmm… I've heard (inaudible ) when we're eating at home. Is that right? 

01:03:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh…Huh… 

01:03:55
SHERI BAUMAN And we are just imagining and the idea was to think of ways. 

01:04:00
SAM STEEN What should she do, that's a very good point though, because it, like you said Roman(ph) you don't want to lie about it, but how can you come up with something that's pretty obvious, that still allows you to be um… 

01:04:10
DORDGE (ph) I'll just come over and tell 'em that, I had already, I already ate and so I am sorry, so he and then you go home. 

01:04:20
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So you could leave and Ileana(ph) . 

01:04:25
ILEANA MEIN (ph) If this invited me then, I since they're my friend, since I am with my friend, then I know what ah… kinda background they have anything. 

01:04:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Umm… 

01:04:35
ILEANA MEIN (ph) And they are my friend, would you like tell me that what they do of that, so I know what they probably could do. 

01:04:45
SAM STEEN So it wouldn't be a surprise for you and you would try it. 

01:04:50
ILEANA MEIN (ph) No, I wouldn't go. 

01:04:50
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… 

01:04:50
SAM STEEN Ha ha ha… 

01:04:50
SHERI BAUMAN Ah… yep! She is smart. 

01:04:55
SAM STEEN If you already know, so unless you can avoid it before it happens. 

01:05:00
SHERI BAUMAN I have it totally off the topic… 

01:05:00
SAM STEEN Yeah, we will have one more to go anyway… 

01:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think is something that you eat at your house, that's… of what most of the people in this group, would think as, ooh, what's this. 

01:05:15
SAM STEEN Does anybody have one of those? 

01:05:15
SHERI BAUMAN You ate anything that's kind of unusual at your house? 

01:05:15
SAM STEEN Umm… 

01:05:20
SHERI BAUMAN I know what you eat, and I'm gonna give… 

01:05:25
SAM STEEN Go ahead, if you know, what is it? 

01:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN Greens. 

01:05:25
SAM STEEN Oh, collard greens. 

01:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, we had that discussion. 

01:05:30
What, what. 

01:05:30
SAM STEEN You never had greens before? 

01:05:30
What's? 

01:05:30
Yeah, what's green? 

01:05:30
SAM STEEN It's a vegetable and you cook it and you cook it, and you keep cooking it and cooking it… 

01:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… 

01:05:35
SAM STEEN …nutrients are no longer there, but it tastes really good. 

01:05:40
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

01:05:40
SAM STEEN Have you had that before? Dordge saying yes. Anybody else? 

01:05:40
Umm… 

01:05:45
SAM STEEN Col, collard, collard greens. 

01:05:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) It's just like when I put carrots, when my mom put carrots in a soup and… 

01:05:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:05:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …and then it doesn't have any taste and then I feel… 

01:05:55
SAM STEEN It's just bouncing in your mouth. 

01:05:55
ROMAN (ph) Yeah. 

01:05:55
SAM STEEN Because it's cooked so long, same thing. 

01:06:00
SHERI BAUMAN It's a really… 

01:06:00
DAIDGE (ph) My dad eats this, I don't like it, it's kimchi. 

01:06:05
SAM STEEN Oh. 

01:06:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, I've had that. 

01:06:05
DAIDGE (ph) I don't like it. 

01:06:05
SHERI BAUMAN It's spicy, isn't it? 

01:06:10
DAIDGE (ph) I doesn't knew it. 

01:06:10
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… 

01:06:10
SAM STEEN I, I like it a lot. It doesn't smell it's very good to me, but it taste really good. Has anybody else tried it? 

01:06:15
Yeah, I was. 

01:06:20
SAM STEEN It's like a cabbage right, it's a cabbage. 

01:06:20
Oh, yeah. 

01:06:20
SHERI BAUMAN Kimchi, it's a Korean dish. 

01:06:20
SAM STEEN It's very spice, it's very spicy. 

01:06:25
DAIDGE (ph) I've to try it. 

01:06:25
SAM STEEN You've tried it before? 

01:06:25
ROMAN (ph) I didn't like it. 

01:06:25
SAM STEEN Roman(ph), Roman(ph) has tried it. 

01:06:30
SHERI BAUMAN You have too… goodness me. 

01:06:30
ROMAN (ph) I don't, I don't like it. 

01:06:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I have had some food like it doesn't smell good, but it tastes good. 

01:06:35
SAM STEEN But it tastes okay. 

01:06:35
Oh, Kimchi. 

01:06:35
DAIDGE (ph) And that these noodles, that all there big fat noodles like that big and that long (inaudible ) makes and he puts the spice and stuff. 

01:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN And that's also not your favorite or do you like it? 

01:06:45
DAIDGE (ph) No I like it. 

01:06:50
SHERI BAUMAN So that you like, but not Kimchi. 

01:06:50
ROMAN (ph) Kimchi is kinda good and kinda bad item. It's like in the middle. 

01:06:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I… I really don't want, umm, it's a candy and belly, jelly belly. 

01:07:05
SAM STEEN That's the flavor (inaudible ). 

01:07:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) No that's… that the time. 

01:07:05

SAM STEEN The jelly belly. 

01:07:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Yeah. 

01:07:15
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:07:20
SHERI BAUMAN At my house, sometimes in the summer, I make borscht. Anybody have borscht? 

01:07:25
Oh what's that? 

01:07:25
SHERI BAUMAN The cold one. 

01:07:25
Yeah. 

01:07:25
But. 

01:07:25
SHERI BAUMAN It's borscht. 

01:07:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, I'm not sure I have eaten. 

01:07:25
I learned borscht. 

01:07:30
SHERI BAUMAN It's a soup, it's, that's made out of beet, so it's really, really red and um, it has kind of a sweet and sour kind of a taste… 

01:07:40
ROMAN (ph) I have (inaudible ). 

01:07:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, but if eat it cold and then you put sour cream in it… 

01:07:45
Oh… 

01:07:45
SHERI BAUMAN And it's yummy. 

01:07:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Yeah. 

01:07:50
ROMAN (ph) I eat it sometimes. 

01:07:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) There is a time when they do and it's better with beans. 

01:07:55
ROMAN (ph) It depends like the beans are like growing, like old, but I mean all they are new. If they're new… it's pretty good, but if it's all look so… 

01:08:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:08:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I don't like it. 

01:08:05
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody else? It's something that we wouldn't… maybe in your house that, we wouldn't know we might think it's unusual. 

01:08:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Oh, I thought you'd say that something new like and I don't know. 

01:08:20
SHERI BAUMAN You better just with… because, we were talking about usual things when you go to someone's house, what would be unusual at your house? 

01:08:25
ROMAN (ph) Well, I don't eat it but my brother eats it. It's like crab legs, but it's made… it's like made it's like a little square and then you put like salt on it and then sour cream outward. And it doesn't taste like the other one. 

01:08:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ha ha ha… So that happens to everyone sometimes food is unusual. Last thing from Oligue(ph) and then we will go ahead to the next question… 

01:08:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Umm… ah… I forgot the name of the food. I will just pass. 

01:08:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, thanks. You have one more. 

01:09:00
SAM STEEN I have one more and this one, you know we ask you this, four or five weeks ago, I'm not sure how you would've answered it, but I have some incline, I have some sort of feeling that I know how you're going to answer, but I'm gonna ask just in case. So, you're invited to a birthday party with your classmate and when you arrived there, you're the only person of your race or ethnicity or culture. How do you feel and what would you do? 

01:09:30
DAIDGE (ph) It's like I don't really feel any different. 

01:09:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So, you think it and so you wouldn't feel any different and what would you do? 

01:09:40
DAIDGE (ph) Just play with everybody, just how usually I would do. 

01:09:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:09:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) What if the people at the dinner make fun? 

01:09:50
SAM STEEN Because you're different? 

01:09:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh…huh… 

01:09:50
SAM STEEN Well, it's an interesting question. Let Roman(ph) answer this (inaudible ) answer that one. 

01:09:55
ROMAN (ph) Well, I will do a kind of the same thing as Daidge(ph), but, but ah, when like when you're the only one there, sometimes it feels uncomfortable, but most times it doesn't, but if everyone makes fun of you, it feel so uncomfortable. But if no one makes fun of you, you should just like go for it. It doesn't really matter. 

01:10:15
SAM STEEN Uh…huh… 

01:10:20
Uh…huh… 

01:10:20
SAM STEEN So, you feel okay, unless somebody makes fun of you, but if they didn't just take a risk and see how much fun you (inaudible ). Oligue(ph) said what if they do make fun of you… what? 

01:10:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And if they do, ah… see I'm gonna secure the only one that's Chinese or Russians. 

01:10:45
SAM STEEN Uh…huh… How would you feel? 

01:10:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I would feel that bad. 

01:10:45
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Ileana(ph) . 

01:10:50
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I would tell everybody like, the people ah… that were at the party, I tell 'em like, what if you were me right now, you are the only person umm, your ah, background that's it. 

01:11:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So it seems… 

01:11:10
SHERI BAUMAN Think you ask them to walk in there in your shoes. 

01:11:10
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:11:10
DAIDGE (ph) I'm kind, you're still at focus I don't really know a lot of Korean peoples. 

01:11:15
SAM STEEN Ah… 

01:11:15
DAIDGE (ph) Like if the school that we go to got enough lot either. I'm used to it. 

01:11:20
SAM STEEN So for you it's not unusual to be the, the only person who is Korean. Are you… and you said you're part Korean, right? 

01:11:30
DAIDGE (ph) Uh…huh… 

01:11:30
SAM STEEN Uh…huh… Hmm… go ahead. 

01:11:35
ROMAN (ph) Sometimes, I feel upset, because people making fun of me, I'm like, like, I'm Russian and Jewish, people make fun of me that, I don't really like it, I will feel upset rather. 

01:11:45
SAM STEEN But then the question is, then what would you do? 

01:11:50
ROMAN (ph) I would actually maybe tell 'em or just go home. 

01:11:50
SAM STEEN Uh…huh… 

01:11:55
ROMAN (ph) Because you don't really like it. 

01:11:55
SAM STEEN So, you don't have to go… 

01:11:55
SHERI BAUMAN And you go to a party to have fun. And that's not fun, isn't it? 

01:12:00
ROMAN (ph) …and if it's not fun then, you've nothing to do there, you know just leave. 

01:12:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I'll just… 

01:12:05
SHERI BAUMAN Alex(ph), alright let's hear from Alex(ph). 

01:12:05
ALEX (ph) I would feel if I, if people were laughing (inaudible ) the only person that with a different background, I would feel sad, because, because you can't fun of people. If they are different background then I would say to the people, umm… how would you feel like very weird and you're the only person from a different background. 

01:12:30
SHERI BAUMAN So, it sounds like everybody has the idea that we can help other people, imagine we, we can ask them to do just what we're doing right now. 

01:12:40
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:12:40
SHERI BAUMAN How about Oligue(ph) has… has a comment in that what everybody would think today we've done complements at the end and we've done the circle at the end, why are… let's think about a different way to end this session and think of something that would be a good way. 

01:12:55
DORDGE (ph) Make our team name… 

01:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN Ah, but let's hear from Oligue(ph) first that's a good idea. 

01:13:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Well, I would just ignore them and they would probably just stop making fun of me. 

01:13:05
DAIDGE (ph) Yeah, I (inaudible ) ignore them, coz they've… don't have… you're not they're not hurting you then they'll stop, because usually people won't do that to hurt people. 

01:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN So if they… if they're not getting sort of what they've wanted… 

01:13:20
DAIDGE (ph) They'd stop… 

01:13:20
SHERI BAUMAN They'd stop. Did you have that ever can happened to you, when you were in the first in school. Some kids took on you… you just observed that, that that's what happens. 

01:13:30
SAM STEEN Do… do kids ever look at you and wonder where you're from like… are you? 

01:13:30
DAIDGE (ph) A lot they… a lot of them thinks I'm from China. 

01:13:35
SAM STEEN Uh huh… and you're smiling, but when you hear that before did it bother you? 

01:13:40
DAIDGE (ph) No no… 

01:13:40
SAM STEEN It didn't? 

01:13:40
DAIDGE (ph) I just, I just tell them I'm Korean. 

01:13:40
SAM STEEN Okay, you just clarify for them. 

01:13:45
DAIDGE (ph) I don't care about that… 

01:13:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah… you know, what that reminds me, when we were saying all those potatoes are like a lot of people don't realize how many different countries there are in Asia. So there's Korea and there's China and there's Japan and there is Vietnam and there is lots of countries and people seem tend to make more potatoes. 

01:14:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Hmm… sometimes or most of the time when… when people are from different countries and the people think they're alone, because… because the people here they, they only know one man (inaudible ) each other people from other countries they're more, they're just American…. 

01:14:30
SHERI BAUMAN So they have additional… additional offer. Who speaks it? And you speak how many languages? 

01:14:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Two. 

01:14:40
SHERI BAUMAN Russian and English? 

01:14:40
ROMAN (ph) Well all of us speak little like… not only little bit but like I only know like one or two words (inaudible ) 

01:14:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:14:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I only speak like, I mean learning Japanese. 

01:14:55
SHERI BAUMAN Ohh. 

01:14:55
SAM STEEN (inaudible ) understands some words… 

01:15:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I know numbers from one, from zero to 99. 

01:15:05
SHERI BAUMAN Good for you… 

01:15:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) In Japanese. 

01:15:05
SHERI BAUMAN So I had asked a question a moment ago about how we should end today and Dordge(ph) had the idea maybe we could talk again about her name, what do you think? 

01:15:15
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Yes… 

01:15:15
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody have any ideas now? 

01:15:15
SAM STEEN So what… how much time that we have left? 

01:15:20
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe we can spend about five minutes on that. 

01:15:20
SAM STEEN Great. 

01:15:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, we'll spend about five minutes or so. Anybody have… oh, we're making some arrangements what we have to. 

01:15:30
SAM STEEN Ileana(ph) has her name 

01:15:35
DAIDGE (ph) I started working… 

01:15:35
SAM STEEN You started working on this one? About the name? 

01:15:40
You know… 

01:15:40
SHERI BAUMAN You started that tradition of… 

01:15:40
That one will (inaudible ) 

01:15:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Yeah, I go around with that. 

01:15:45
SAM STEEN Well then… and then she can start sure. Go ahead Ileana(ph) . 

01:15:50
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Backgrounds. 

01:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN That's amazing. 

01:15:50
SAM STEEN Background… it is and I agree. 

01:15:50
Uh huh… 

01:15:55
I like that… 

01:15:55
Yeah, I like that. 

01:15:55
Okay, uh… huh… 

01:16:00
SHERI BAUMAN Wow, that was pretty easy. 

01:16:00
SAM STEEN How about you? I didn't hear you, I didn't see your body was there anything else? 

01:16:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Uh huh… 

01:16:05
SAM STEEN Wow, I'm okay with that. 

01:16:05
SHERI BAUMAN And I am too. And you know what, until the very last minute of the very last session we can still change your (inaudible ) but at least we have this a starting name. Okay, well everybody have a really good week. 

01:16:20
Thank you. 

01:16:20
SHERI BAUMAN And we will see you… 

01:16:25
Next week. 

01:16:25
SHERI BAUMAN Next week. Thanks for participating… 

01:16:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Next Saturday. 

01:16:30
SAM STEEN See you later… Okay. 

01:16:35
Discussion 

01:16:40
SAM STEEN Hmm… so what do you think? 

01:16:40
SHERI BAUMAN I think, they got it and I think they were engaged. I think that's the second time that we've met that it's been sort off I don't know when I'm going deeper emotional level and that may be hard for them. I'm not sure, what did you see? 

01:17:00
SAM STEEN I don't it was… 

01:17:05
SHERI BAUMAN It wasn't us you know, that we… we got there… 

01:17:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:17:05
SHERI BAUMAN But this was still more talking rather than the active things that we've done so… 

01:17:10
SAM STEEN Uh… huh… that's true. 

01:17:10
SHERI BAUMAN I wondered about just even the need for more activity engagement… 

01:17:15
SAM STEEN Uh… huh… I didn't feel like we needed more, I think that we didn't keep the session going too long, so it was appropriate in terms of the time. Ah, and I think you're right, they were still engaged and it wasn't as difficult as the third session. But I think, and I also think it was easier because of the third session. 

01:17:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right and I think you know, we gave them they've to imagine that you're someone else of course the person they imagined was themselves. 

01:17:45
SAM STEEN Themselves, yeah. 

01:17:45
SHERI BAUMAN So but they… they it was… there was one step removed. 

01:17:50
SAM STEEN Uh… huh… 

01:17:50
SHERI BAUMAN I'm a little concerned about ah, Oligue's(ph) and I think I don't think he's trying to dominate in any way, but I think he's really getting into it and it could look like monopolizing if we're not careful… 

01:18:05
SAM STEEN Okay. 

01:18:05
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think? Did you notice that? 

01:18:05
SAM STEEN I didn't notice. I noticed that he's very much wanted to participate. I've noticed that he ah… ah, is very thoughtful again in terms of how he processes information. I didn't get a sense that other people didn't have the opportunity to speak and when we would say Oligue(ph) do you mind, if we let someone else. But just to sort of confirm what you're saying when everyone had left he said, this is even… this is getting more fun. This I… I forget exactly how he said it, but he was saying this is even more fun than he thought it would have been. This is getting more fun as we continue on. So that maybe what you see that ah, if you recall and you share with me and not the students. 

01:18:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right. That he was one… 

01:18:50
SAM STEEN That he was one of the… the quite ones and that you were concerned that he wouldn't have an opportunity to (crosstalk) 

01:18:55
SHERI BAUMAN Right so… that tells you about the first impressions and assumptions. 

01:18:55
SAM STEEN Right right right right… 

01:19:00
SHERI BAUMAN And I do, I do think some of it is language. 

01:19:00
SAM STEEN In terms of processing… 

01:19:00
SHERI BAUMAN That it takes him a little bit to formulate exactly what he wants to say. 

01:19:05
SAM STEEN Do you think the other students have a problem with how much he's sharing? Once you monopolizing… 

01:19:10
SHERI BAUMAN No… but I want to know, but I do want to pay attention to that. 

01:19:10
SAM STEEN Okay. 

01:19:10
SHERI BAUMAN Ah and I asked both of them and what about Dordge(ph)? What… what what's your sense of her? 

01:19:15
SAM STEEN Well, I had the I had the back up a little bit, because I'm certainly trying to watch everybody's body language… 

01:19:20
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:19:20
SAM STEEN …like you are and Dordge(ph) actually was talking when you were about to talk and then she said, I don't have anything to say. I didn't want her to get defensive but I just wanted her to have the opportunity. 

01:19:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:19:30
SAM STEEN But then if you take back when you… you pause the question about ahh, like a food ahh and I was speaking about collard green she very readily was okay, so that just let you know that she's still… she's fine in my opinion she's okay. 

01:19:45
SHERI BAUMAN I was just by the way I know… I know that was a bit of a tangent, but I felt like to make the imagining real. You know, to give them something to think about and I had to laugh occasion and I'm a picky eater so… 

01:19:55
SAM STEEN Right (crostalk) 

01:19:55
SHERI BAUMAN So this would be really an issue for me. It's also interesting he, he says sometimes that or he I think, he said in the first he doesn't know much about this greens heritage, but yeah obviously there is some very traditional Korean foods at least. 

01:20:10
SAM STEEN Hmmm Hmmm 

01:20:10
SHERI BAUMAN There may be more that he doesn't… 

01:20:15
SAM STEEN Hmm hmm 

01:20:15
SHERI BAUMAN …recognizes his part of that. 

01:20:15
SAM STEEN And its and I wonder he definitely has some cultural assets and strengths and ah, when given the opportunity he shares like ah, if someone I wondered you know the kids look at him and wonder where he's from and he said, yeah and… and they think I'm Chinese. And how is that? How do you feel he's not bothered about this. 

01:20:35
SHERI BAUMAN No and he clarifies it. 

01:20:35
SAM STEEN Yeah, absolutely that I'm Korean you know. So that's a good thing. 

01:20:35
SHERI BAUMAN Interesting, yeah I think these kids have ah have some really good strengths and assets and maybe we wanna be sure that they know how to use that at the end to make their school a better place. Let's make sure we go there with that… 

01:20:50
SAM STEEN In terms of where do we go from here. What do you thinking? 

01:20:55
SHERI BAUMAN I think, as you know this is Session four so we only have two more. 

01:21:00
SAM STEEN Hmm hmm 

01:21:00
SHERI BAUMAN I think we wanna do ah… things that will solidify what's already happened. I don't think we wanna open up in a whole new direction. 

01:21:10
SAM STEEN Ah good point. 

01:21:10
SHERI BAUMAN Ahh so that's one. 

01:21:10
SAM STEEN We also didn't discussed the fact that we might wanna be explicit about the fact that's we only have two sessions left. 

01:21:20
SHERI BAUMAN I know. 

01:21:20
SAM STEEN You know, I hadn't really thought about. Well we've kinda hinted towards it and I think they know it was six sessions, but we might want to just be clear that. You know as you think about we're almost done, you know how are you feeling about that part? 

01:21:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. And that maybe that's a good… 

01:21:35
SAM STEEN Way of beginning? 

01:21:35
SHERI BAUMAN …way of beginning this time. 

01:21:35
SAM STEEN May be. 

01:21:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I think there's a comfort level and a ritual of check in and checkout, but after a while it becomes routine and it's not challenging anymore… 

01:21:45
SAM STEEN hmm hmm 

01:21:45
SHERI BAUMAN …so that would be a a good break… 

01:21:50
SAM STEEN hmm hmm 

01:21:50
SHERI BAUMAN …you know, in the pattern. 

01:21:50
SAM STEEN It would be. And then it's need to see them kind of self-monitor like they know the (inaudible ) and what have to move there and we don't even have to say that… 

01:21:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I'm not even sure again what exactly whether they're what they mean, but I think… 

01:22:00
SAM STEEN I think they have knowledge… 

01:22:05
SHERI BAUMAN …they're acknowledging… 

01:22:05
SAM STEEN Yes. 

01:22:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, exactly that they're… they're ahh taking some risks… 

01:22:05
SAM STEEN And feelings are changing and, and they're growing and and experiencing some real things. 

01:22:15
SHERI BAUMAN It's interesting how curious they are about you. 

01:22:15
SAM STEEN What do you mean? 

01:22:20
SHERI BAUMAN It seems like and maybe I'm mixing up sessions and there're several times… 

01:22:25
SAM STEEN Hmm hmm 

01:22:25
SHERI BAUMAN …when they wanted to ask you. So in the last session we had thought about having them ask questions. I'm definitely asking my question that I alerted you too… 

01:22:35
SAM STEEN Oh, no problem, no problem. 

01:22:35
SHERI BAUMAN And then maybe that'll open that up. So suddenly, we have I'm thinking that we've had some leftovers that we… 

01:22:40
SAM STEEN We've created two or three more sessions… 

01:22:45
SHERI BAUMAN But we… but can't do that but maybe we wanna be sure that last session gives opportunities. 

01:22:50
SAM STEEN Hmm hmm 

01:22:50
SHERI BAUMAN For that so we have one before and we're gonna do the creation. 

01:22:50
SAM STEEN We'll go back to your point. You were saying ahh you're wondering oh how… you, you something along like they're curious about me or just to clarify what you were saying. 

01:23:00
SHERI BAUMAN Well, they've… they've several of them have asked what about you Sam? 

01:23:05
SAM STEEN Oh, I see in particular they have and I agree and I was just wondering what you were thinking about that. And maybe we could generalize, maybe it's because I'm a male, the only black man here or I'm… I'm a little younger. But remember when they knew I was coming and you said they're assume that, how old is he, you know and things like that. I'm not sure but… 

01:23:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I think it's… I think it's kind of… 

01:23:25
SAM STEEN That's what you… 

01:23:25
SHERI BAUMAN There was also at least we know a couple don't have ah, male figures in the home. 

01:23:30
SAM STEEN Hmm… 

01:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN So that maybe part of the appeal. 

01:23:30
SAM STEEN It could be part of… 

01:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN And you're the new kid. You're come… you're from mysterious guy from somewhere else that flew in. so… 

01:23:40
SAM STEEN What about do you feel the… the self-disclosure has been appropriate. 

01:23:45
SHERI BAUMAN Absolutely. 

01:23:45
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:45
SHERI BAUMAN And um… you know I think we talked in our introduction… 

01:23:50
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:50
SHERI BAUMAN …about what's the purpose, and here I think the purpose is not only in providing examples that we're not using it to take the stage for ourselves or to be inappropriately trying to win their favor. 

01:24:05
SAM STEEN Hmm… oh absolutely. 

01:24:05
SHERI BAUMAN But I think examples I mean… who is a kid to me nobody else knew about borscht. 

01:24:10
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… Hmm… hmm… 

01:24:10
SHERI BAUMAN And now, I am hungry for some borscht. 

01:24:10
SAM STEEN Ha ha ha… right. So we know how to proceed the next activity is a lot more hands on. 

01:24:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right so we're going to… yeah. 

01:24:15
SAM STEEN So we will be moving around. 

01:24:15
SHERI BAUMAN And so our opening is gonna be we're at… this is… you know we only have to… 

01:24:20
SAM STEEN Right. 

01:24:20
SHERI BAUMAN …really feeling about that, we do our activity. 

01:24:25
SAM STEEN Solidify the name, tell me what do you… do you think when they were able to come out with the name that quickly? I was surprised. 

01:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, and… I don't know whether there is agreement with… we're done or they like that so. It's interesting. 

01:24:40
SAM STEEN I think, they are comfortable in that term… term we have said… 

01:24:45
SHERI BAUMAN That's true. 

01:24:45
SAM STEEN This just my impression. 

01:24:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:24:45
SAM STEEN No, I don't think so. 

01:24:50
SHERI BAUMAN We'll see if they. 

01:24:50
SAM STEEN We'll see… yeah. 

01:24:50
SHERI BAUMAN So we need to… to review our… 

01:24:55
SAM STEEN Hmm… hmm… 

01:24:55
SHERI BAUMAN …next activity. 

01:24:55
SAM STEEN Okay. 

01:24:55
SHERI BAUMAN And um… I think… I don't think we need to alter much? 

01:25:00
SAM STEEN No that's moving forward. 

01:25:00
SHERI BAUMAN So we… on one to ten how do you think this group has gone? 

01:25:05
SAM STEEN The overall experience? 

01:25:05
SHERI BAUMAN Ah… ah… 

01:25:05
SAM STEEN …or this session? 

01:25:05
SHERI BAUMAN Overall. 

01:25:10
SAM STEEN Hmm… one being not that great and ten being exceptional. Um… I knew that any time you have the opportunity to run a group with… with children, adolescents and you give them the opportunity to really express themselves, they were asked to do challenge and so… but it never ceases to amaze me. 

01:25:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

01:25:30
SAM STEEN So it's a ten, um… but I am not surprised. 

01:25:35
SHERI BAUMAN What about how we're working together given that we haven't done this type of thing before? 

01:25:40
SAM STEEN To be honest, if I thought it wasn't going to go as well as it is going. I don't think I would have done it. 

01:25:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, well I had the same thought of it. 

01:25:50
SAM STEEN Ha ha ha… 

01:25:50
SHERI BAUMAN You know, we've got to check out our assumptions… 

01:25:50
SAM STEEN Just in case right. 

01:25:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right… and make sure cool. Okay, well lets move on. 

01:25:55
SAM STEEN Great work until next time. 

01:26:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay.
