ROBERTA “BOBBIE” EVANS Hello, I’m Bobbie Evans. Dean of the Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences at the University of Montana. The video you’re about to watch addresses current ethical issues facing mental health professionals in today’s complex information overloaded culture. I want to assure you that you’re in good hands. I’ve been closely associated with the University of Montana’s Department of Counseling for over 20 years. I watched it grow, earn national accreditation, become a thriving unit and today one of the most successful in the pacific northwest. The ethics course in counsel education was developed by faculty here who researched and written extensively in the area for decades. Students consistently rated one of their favorite and most valued courses noting the role it plays in shaping their careers, their identity and their professional development. Professional ethics codes define the essence of any profession. It’s not much about a set of rules as it is really about thinking deeply about best possible ways to move professional services and advance the profession itself. Being ethical is a lifelong commitment. You have to stay current and centered in an ever changing landscape of mental healthcare. That’s why videos like these are so important. I trust that the content covered by these cutting-edge professors, graduates and top-notch students will be helpful to both students and practicing mental health professionals alike. Here at the university of Montana, we are especially thrilled to be part of making this video possible.

VERONICA JOHNSON Hello and welcome to counseling and psychotherapy ethics: self-awareness, competence and boundaries. I’m Roni(ph) Johnson, associate professor of Counsel Education at the University of Montana and your co-host. 

00:02:35
John Sommers-Flanagan, PhD 

00:02:35
University of Montana 

00:02:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And hi. My name is John Sommers-Flanagan. I’m the other co-host and you know Roni, I’ve been thinking about ethics for about 30 years. 

00:02:45
VERONICA JOHNSON It’s a long time. 

00:02:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Makes me feel kind of old but one of the things that comes to mind about ethics for me is we have so much information out there. We have lots of different ethics, codes. We have ACA, APA, NSW and many others. We also have textbooks. We have ethical decision making models that we may or may not follow. We also have so much other information that it can be hard to know what to apply but what makes it even harder in my mind is that it comes through each of us as individuals. We each have our own history. We have our own psychology, we have our own emotional state and I think that makes applying ethics even more challenging because it goes through the person and we have to work at it. 

00:03:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Absolutely. And as an ethics instructor, I’m driven to help students learn how to focus on self-awareness and competence. How the parts of themselves that complicate each of us really affect the work that we do as counselors. And I want students to be prepared to manage and handle many ethical scenarios that they’ll be confronted with as professionals. 

00:03:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And there are so many different scenarios. For me, even though there are so many different scenarios, a lot of it boils down to two things. Self-awareness and competence. Self-awareness, I need to know my issues. I need to know my limits. Competence, I need the knowledge. I need the skills. I need the right attitudes to bring in the room. I also recognize that sometimes ethics can feel very abstract and it’s hard to know for sure how to apply them in those specific scenarios or situations. And what I would say is that in this video, uh… one of the things that we’re focusing on is how can we use repeated self-reflection and active practice to prepare ourselves to deal with those many different scenarios. 

00:04:45
VERONICA JOHNSON So in this video, we’ll be focusing on three main topics. First, self-awareness, second, competence and competently referring clients and third boundaries in the age of social media. 

00:05:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know self-awareness is really the foundation for so many different things for counselors and psychotherapists, including empathy and we know empathy is an evidence based factor and for us to be able to be empathically in resonance with our clients requires self-awareness. Self-awareness is also necessary for us to be competent and when all these is going on, when we are self-aware, our brain and I know talking about the brain is very popular now is it’s super active. It involves the insula which is a certain structure in the brain. It also involves the body and being able to inhibit ourselves from acting on our impulses. And part of what’s going on in the brain is this thing that we call bracketing in counseling or bracketing in psychotherapy and that is when we take our judgments, our thoughts, our values that maybe unhelpful and we kind of put them aside. We know they’re there but we try not to let them affect our interactions with clients because they would be unhelpful. And of course, no one can bracket everything. We have judgments and thoughts that are unhelpful leak in and so it becomes a process of how do we manage those thoughts and those feelings and those judgments that come in. For example, Roni, let’s say you’re uncomfortable with a particular kind of client. Let’s say, it’s somebody who’s outside your range of competence. Maybe it’s somebody who is uh… meth addict or maybe it’s somebody who has an eating disorder. You will be feeling and noticing that, that person is outside of your limits of competence. Other kinds of scenarios that can bring up lots of different thoughts and feelings and judgments, let’s say, we have a, let’s say, we have a counselor who has done a tour of duty in Iraq and the client who comes in is Muslim or maybe is from an Arabic country and there is going to be some kinds of reactions. Let’s say uh… the counselor is of a maybe a Christian or Muslim background and the client comes in and really is interested in issues related to sexual diversity. Uh… those are going to cause reactions that we need to bracket or manage in order to be competent and helpful counselors. 

00:07:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Those are great examples, John and I think that one of the most important things that you said is that bracketing is not removing ourselves from the counseling that we to. But being able to manage the reactions that we have. Being able to recognize them and bracket them without letting them negatively influence the work that we do with clients. We want to respond sensitively to the issues that the clients are presenting. We want to display competency in bracketing or managing the emotional and psychological responses that we have to clients as they are sharing their stories with us and the focus is always on building relationship through empathic understanding. It’s no easy task. One way that I’ve attempted to teach students the process of working with bracketing and managing their reactions to clients and issues that clients might present is through an activity that I like to call be that client. It’s an activity that I ask students to reflect and think about particular client that they think would be challenging to work with. Maybe it’s an issue that the client is presenting or maybe it’s a cultural identity. Umm… or maybe it’s umm… an identity that the client umm… possesses that this counselor has a particular challenge working with. And I ask the student to reflect and to write about that particular client in as much detail as they can, as they can imagine. And then also to pay attention to and write about and reflect on the thoughts, the feeling, umm… the reactions that they have while they are reflecting upon this client. The next step in that process is to ask the student to then sit in the shoes of that client and actually be that client with uh… umm… person in the counselor role just reflecting and listening and umm… being present with them as they express what it’s like to be that client for a few minutes. 

00:09:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That sounds great Roni. Well, let’s watch Roni as she does the ”Be That Client” classroom demonstration. 

00:09:30
“Be That Client” 

00:09:30
Demonstration 

00:09:35
VERONICA JOHNSON In this activity the student is instructed to reflect and write about a difficult client. A client that they feel would be especially challenging for them to serve for any number of reasons. Kim has already had an opportunity to reflect and write about this client. This might be an opportunity for you as the viewer to pause the film and take a moment and reflect on the kind of client that you think would be especially challenging to work with. Pay attention to any details that you can think of as you imagine this client and also pay attention especially to any thoughts, feelings, reactions that you have as the counselor while you’re imagining this client. 

00:10:20
Pause the video, and take this time to reflect on what clients would be most challenging for you to work with. 

00:10:25
VERONICA JOHNSON What will happen next is I will engage Kim in a role play where she will be asked to be the client that she has reflected on. The focus of the activity is not on the person in the counselor’s role. The activity is for the purposes of the person who is reflected on a client that they find themselves especially reactive to. And on their opportunity to be that client. I’m gonna be functioning as a reflective listener and I might ask some questions that will help get at the story behind Kim’s client. But the focus is really and the purpose is really on Kim’s experience of being the client that she’s written about. So Kim, thank you for taking some time to reflect on a client that you think will be especially challenging for you to work with. 

00:11:15
KIM Okay. 

00:11:15
VERONICA JOHNSON And now, what I want you to do is imagine yourself sitting in the place of that client. 

00:11:20
KIM Okay. 

00:11:25
VERONICA JOHNSON And so for a few minutes, I’m just gonna invite you to be that client and share with me anything that you’d like me to know about you. 

00:11:30
KIM As the client. 

00:11:35
VERONICA JOHNSON As the client. 

00:11:35
KIM Okay. 

00:11:35
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes. 

00:11:40
KIM Okay. Umm… okay uh… I, first of all been brought here, I have to be here umm… because my case manager told me that if I didn’t come and get some counseling that I wouldn’t get my kids back. 

00:11:55
VERONICA JOHNSON It’s hard for you to be here today. You don’t want to be here. 

00:12:00
KIM I don’t want to be here. But I do want my kids back. 

00:12:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. So having your kids back is really important to you. 

00:12:05
KIM Yes, yes. And umm… I don’t even know why uh… I, they really took them away from me because I work really hard and I try to take care of them but you know, I can’t always be there at night because I work at night. 

00:12:25
VERONICA JOHNSON It’s hard for you to understand why this has happened. 

00:12:30
KIM Yeah. 

00:12:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Why your kids were taken away. 

00:12:35
KIM Yeah. Well, the, the person who reported me said that umm… I didn’t take very good care of my kids and then the people from Child and Family Services said that they had gotten a lot of calls about me and I didn’t even know why because I do as much as I can. 

00:12:55
VERONICA JOHNSON You feel like you’re doing everything, everything you can do. 

00:12:55
KIM Yeah. I’m a single mom with three kids, you know. Uh… I can’t afford a baby-sitter. I have to work at night and you know, it’s really hard because I, I want to be a good mom and I think I do a good job. But still there is times that I want to, you know, have some time for myself too. You know and it seems like nobody else can see it from my perspective like that I need time too. Besides when I’m working. 

00:13:25
VERONICA JOHNSON So sometimes, it feels like, you don’t have any choices. 

00:13:30
KIM Right, I don’t have any choices at all. So, you know, if I want to go out on nights that I’m off work, you know, that’s the only time that I get for me. And then everybody kind of gets involved in, all of a sudden, here I am in your office trying to explain to you that I don’t want to be here. 

00:13:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, yeah. And I here that it’s, it’s hard for you to be here and perhaps another place in your life where you don’t feel like you have any choices. 

00:14:00
KIM Yeah, I mean, it’s bad enough that I have to umm… go see my case manager. Umm… I have to go umm… have CD evals, I have to report umm… to my parole officer although, I only have a couple of months left on that. But it just seems like everybody is constantly making my do stuff. I mean, I should have some freedom. I’m a grownup. I have, I’m a mom. I have kids. I just get sick of it. Really sick of it. 

00:14:40
VERONICA JOHNSON And maybe being a mom takes away some of your choices too and some of your freedom, it sounds like. 

00:14:45
KIM Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, it’s just overwhelming, you know. The teenager constantly, constantly badgering me for money. Constantly. Like whether it’s gas money or lunch money or whatever, clothes. You know, and then my littlest one who is five, she just constantly on me the whole time I’m at home. So I can’t get anything done even if I wanted to. So it just feels like I’m just overwhelmed like every where I go. And then I have to go to work. I work all night. I can hardly get any sleep when I get home because I’m all ramped up from work. And then all of a sudden, somebody is calling on me like that I’m a bad mom. 

00:15:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. And I hear that being a good mom is important to you. 

00:15:35
KIM Yeah. 

00:15:35
VERONICA JOHNSON That’s really challenging to be there for your kids. 

00:15:40
KIM Yeah. It can be, yeah. I mean, sometimes it’s just like, it’s all I can do to just get up in the morning. So, if they, you know, they just… I don’t know. 

00:15:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Somebody is always requiring something of you or needing something from you. 

00:16:00
KIM Yeah, yeah and when I ask for help from my older kids, they don’t really help that much and it’s just a constant battle. So, I guess some things don’t happen that probably should. 

00:16:15
VERONICA JOHNSON There is a part of you that feels like maybe there, there are some things that, that should be happening that aren’t. 

00:16:25
KIM Yeah, there are, I mean, the little one has missed a lot of school this year because I have to sleep and umm… older kids, of course, they are not gonna be of any help and so I don’t get her up in time and she misses school. So… But she’s only a first grade, so it’s not like it’s that big of a deal. 

00:16:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, so there is, there is some part of you that feels like, this is, this is an important thing that she’s not in school and then there is another part that feels like, it’s okay because she’s, she’s still little. 

00:17:00
KIM Yeah, yeah. I don’t think, it’s that big of a deal. You know, umm… I, I think she’s doing really good. She does okay on her spelling test and stuff. So it’s like, it’s not a huge deal if she misses school. And besides, then she can just cuddle with me and we can just hang out. 

00:17:15
De-briefing of “Be That Client” Exercise 

00:17:15
VERONICA JOHNSON All right, let’s stop there. 

00:17:15
KIM Okay. 

00:17:20
VERONICA JOHNSON I want to just take a few minutes and check in with you. What did that feel like to you to sit in the place of this client that you think would be really, really hard to work with for you? 

00:17:30
KIM Well, it was, I don’t know. I felt, I felt kind of umm… a little bit uh… really self-conscious of my counselor self because I don’t think that I was, had really thought about what it might be like to be that person. You know, I was thinking more like umm… you know, she’s a bad mom because she, you know, isn’t taking care of her kids and there is a lot of people that have called on her and that I wasn’t sure umm… you know that she, I guess, so there is thinking is that she was probably not trying. 

00:18:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:18:10
KIM I think and then when I was her, that’s what I kept saying is like that I was trying and that seemed really opposite of what my first judgment was. 

00:18:20
VERONICA JOHNSON So it sounds like there is a little bit of a shift within you when you were her. 

00:18:25
KIM Yeah. 

00:18:25
VERONICA JOHNSON Can you talk a little bit more about that? 

00:18:25
KIM I guess when I was thinking about what, what in the world would it feel like to be her, then it was like, how does, I don’t know, it just felt, the shift was more like to see the world from like her perspective because it would, I think it would be really awful to have a lot of professionals telling you what you had to do all the time. And I haven’t really thought about that before. 

00:18:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. So, there is a, I’m curious about how the thoughts and feelings and reactions that you reflected on in your written activity maybe changed and how, how you can reflect on those thoughts and feelings and reactions now having sat in that client’s shoes just for a couple of minutes. 

00:19:15
KIM Okay. 

00:19:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Is that make sense? 

00:19:15
KIM Yeah. So when I think about like what I wrote, I think what I wrote if we read it right now together, it’s all judgy like and she’s had several boyfriends and you know. Umm… she works at night and she doesn’t feed her kids and all of that and I was, I think, I was angry when I was writing it. 

00:19:35
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:19:35
KIM And now, I feel like, that totally shifted. I don’t, I don’t think I’m angry at her anymore. I think that I think there is something umm… well now my, my training is kicking in a little bit and I’m thinking about, you know, that she’s oppressed, right? And that she’s in a situation that might not be avoidable. 

00:20:00
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:20:00
KIM To an extent. 

00:20:00
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:20:05
KIM I haven’t thought about it that way. 

00:20:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Thank you for being vulnerable in this situation. That was a, a big thing that I asked you to do. 

00:20:10
KIM Yeah. 

00:20:15
VERONICA JOHNSON And I appreciate it. Taken the risk to do that. 

00:20:15
KIM Okay. Yeah. 

00:20:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:20:20
“Be That Client” 

00:20:20
Debrief 

00:20:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Roni, it was great to watch you and Kim do the “Be That Client” activity and I know you didn’t want to know the particular client she was going to be and so my first question for you is what was that like when you first heard the client or was able to identify the client as an instructor, as a counselor and as a person, what was going through your mind? 

00:20:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. I didn’t want to know because I really wanted this to be as authentic an experience as possible and while the purpose of the activity is for the person in the client role, it’s also an experience for the counselor. Umm… so my first reaction when I heard about her client was a personal reaction because I am a mother of two young children and the thought of leaving them alone at night, to go have some free time really stirs up a reaction in me. 

00:21:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure, sure. 

00:21:15
VERONICA JOHNSON And so what I had to do was pay attention to that and set that aside and try and connect with my client and what circumstances might be at play in her life that lead her to make that choice because I think that even if it may not appear this way from the outside world, she is doing the best she can. And she doesn’t feel like she has many choices. And when I was able to get there, then I was able to really have some empathy and even relate to her in what it’s like to be a parent and to feel sometimes like, you don’t have any choices and you have constant demands upon your time and resources. 

00:22:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. One of the things, I noticed umm… just as I was watching is that, you know, we have different hats we put on as counselors or as therapists and you kept off your assessment cap even though, it was not a demonstration of you doing counseling, I noticed, you did active listening, active listening, summarizing and you started to focusing on her not feeling like she was free to make choices. And I thought, all of that was a sign that you were keeping off the judgment, assessment hat and sticking with the counseling hat in order to try to have a deeper understanding of that client. 

00:22:35
VERONICA JOHNSON And that’s really my hope for both the person who is being that client and the person who is playing the counselor that they will focus in on empathic understanding because they have to be able to get there before they can do, I think a competent assessment. Umm… I need to appear non-judgmental to my client and I need to be able to connect with them and build a relationship with them in order for the client to feel like they can share their story with me. 

00:23:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Need that foundation of empathy and listening. 

00:23:10
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, yeah. So that’s really, I think where I was coming from as a counselor is wanting to provide the relationship and the safety for the client to not feel judged or assessed, so that she can share with me her, her authentic experience. 

00:23:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN One of the things that I’ve been thinking about in terms of how we automatically and sometimes intrinsically judge clients is uh… sometimes we’ll say, well this is a tough kid or this is a challenging parent or this is a difficult client and one of the ways, I’ve started to reframe that is instead of thinking of a tough kid or a difficult parent is to think this is a kid who is in a tough situation. This is a parent who is in a difficult situation. 

00:23:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Yup. 

00:23:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And or a challenging life situation and so I find that reframing that in my head also helps me to kind of bracket that judgment a bit. 

00:24:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Right. This is a person with a problem and not a problem person. 

00:24:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. One of the thing that I thought of as uh… I know in class sometimes students, you’ll ask them to be that client or to identify difficult client or a client they would see as difficult and they’ll say, huh, I can’t come up with one. 

00:24:25
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:24:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And my reaction to that is whoo, that might mean that you need to do some work because sometimes, we get surprised by the kinds of clients who push our buttons and so I think the more self-reflection and introspection, we can do on that, the better. 

00:24:40
VERONICA JOHNSON And as an instructor, if a student said that during the activity, I would say something very similar to what you just said but you might be surprised and so try really hard to think about somebody that you find, that you might find challenging because the more you can practice with this and experience it now in the safety of the classroom, with a classmate, the better prepared, you’ll be to actually encounter this with a client. 

00:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Roni, thank you so much for taking the risk and demonstrating, “Be That Client.” 

00:25:15
VERONICA JOHNSON You’re welcome. 

00:25:20
Introduction to Competence 

00:25:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN One really big issue in ethics right now has to do with referral. It has to do with whether or not counselors and psychotherapist can do values based referrals and/or competence based referrals? That is a super big issue but I like to say one thing about it is that whether it’s a values based referral or a competence based referral, either way it requires competence. It requires competence and skills to sensitively and compassionately provide the referral in a way that is in the best interest of the client. 

00:26:00
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes and counselors are not expected to be value free. But our values can’t interfere with the services that we provide. Again, we need to be able to manage our reactions, recognize how our values are playing into the service that we provide to clients and competently respond to the issues that are being presented to us. 

00:26:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN In this next segment, Roni will be interviewing Brian Cochran. And Brian is a colleague of ours at the University of Montana. He’s a gay man and he is going to talk about some of his experiences and expectations that he might have if he was a client in a situation where he is referred. 

00:26:45
Interview with Brian and Roni 

00:26:50
VERONICA JOHNSON This is Brian Cochran, a colleague of ours here at the University, university of Montana. Thank you Brian for joining us and being a part of our video. 

00:26:55
BRIAN COCHRAN I’m happy to be here. Thank you. 

00:27:00
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. Umm… our first question for you is how would you feel about being referred to another counselor umm… based on a competence issue? For example, say you have a drug problem or an eating disorder and the counselor tells you that they’re not competent to work with you in that area. 

00:27:20
BRIAN COCHRAN I think, it’s interesting that you use those two particular examples. The drug problem or an eating disorder are kind of areas where people often feel like they may have or not have competence specifically. So I think something like that would make a lot of sense because I would understand not every counselor is equally trained in working with the specific issue. Umm… but if it’s something more general or common like depression or PTSD, I think, I think it would be really strange to be referred out for things that are really routinely part of practice for, for counselors. 

00:27:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. So now, let’s say, from a client’s perspective, what would it feel like to you to be referred based on umm… a conflicting values? Say that umm… the counselor tells you that they don’t work with gay or lesbian clients? 

00:28:00
BRIAN COCHRAN I think that would be really difficult to not take that personally in that situation. I, I believe that LGBT people grow up feeling very different from other people from an early age. We often experience bullying or victimization and having a counselor to say, I can’t work with you because of your identity whether that be sexual orientation and/or gender identity would feel really rejecting and would kind of reinvoke a lot of that trauma that people might have experienced before. So it would be really tough to get that message from a counselor, I believe. 

00:28:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. And, and you feel like it would, it would cause some harm perhaps to your identity. 

00:28:35
BRIAN COCHRAN I think, it would. Quite, quite definitely so. Umm… on the other hand, you know, I would want to enter into the therapeutic relationship unaware that this person had a values conflict and was not gonna be able to be fully present in working with me and then realize over time working together that there were limits to our therapeutic work because this person had difficulties working with me because of my sexual orientation. That would be another really difficult scenario. So it’s, you know, being referred would be a positive in some ways because then you wouldn’t have this potentially umm… impaired therapeutic relationship from the beginning and then on the other hand, it would also be a definite hit to my own identity as well. 

00:29:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. So it sounds like, it would be important at what point in the counseling relationship, you received the referral. 

00:29:20
BRIAN COCHRAN Right. 

00:29:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, okay. In either case, how do you think a counselor could communicate a referral in a sensitive way like what, do you have any recommendations as to what that might look like? 

00:29:30
BRIAN COCHRAN Sure. You know, I think the really the main thing that would make it an easy or an easy early experience for the client is to have the counselor to really own it as their own limitation and to say instead of this is something about you, this is the reason that I can’t work with you to really identify it as umm… this is something that I’m limited in terms of my abilities as a counselor. I don’t have enough experience in this area or I want to refer you out to someone who has expertise in eating disorders or someone who has a lot of experience in working with LGBT individuals. I think that would be the best way too make that referral while you know still helping the person to find new resources and not damaging that particular relationship. 

00:30:10
VERONICA JOHNSON And so what I’m hearing is, the counselor really takes responsibility. 

00:30:15
BRIAN COCHRAN Definitely. 

00:30:15
VERONICA JOHNSON For the referral. And doesn’t place any of the blame on the client. 

00:30:15
BRIAN COCHRAN Right. 

00:30:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:30:20
BRIAN COCHRAN And, and I think that’s really a fair assessment because it is the limitation of the counselor in this case and it’s not anything about identities of the client that really prevent that therapeutic relationship from being able to be effective. 

00:30:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Thank you for that. As a minority person, what are some of the signs that would tell you, this is a safe person for me to talk to? 

00:30:40
BRIAN COCHRAN Oh. I, I think that a lot of it has to do with sort of subtle things that you pick up on that the person is connected with you. Umm… kind of what we would just call general good counseling skills in a humanistic person would call unconditional positive regard. 

00:30:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes. 

00:30:55
BRIAN COCHRAN So the counselor listens to you, is affirming umm… reflects what you’re saying very well. Uses your own language and in addition to that kind of LGBT specific things that would help indicate that this would be a safe person would be things like a waiting room that has LGBT affirmative materials in it. Maybe magazines or advertisements. Umm… books on the shelves that indicate that the person has read and knows about LGBT issues and identities. I think would be really helpful. 

00:31:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:31:20
BRIAN COCHRAN And using inclusive language and, and really using terminology that reflects the variety of diverse situations that people might occupy. So diversity in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity. Umm… I also think that umm… knowledge about the community to some extent would be really helpful. So obviously not relying on the client to inform them about what it’s like to be LGBT but having a good sense of LGBT identities. So for example, umm… if legislation that might impact the LGBT community is being proposed in that particular area where you’re living or umm… there is a major event like (inaudible) for example. Umm… the therapist being knowledgeable about that and asking how it impacts the client, I think would be a sign of affirmative umm… counseling and being able to be in a safe place. 

00:32:10
VERONICA JOHNSON Great. Thank you. 

00:32:10
BRIAN COCHRAN Sure. 

00:32:10
VERONICA JOHNSON You’ve offered some really helpful and concrete suggestions for how a counselor might be affirming. 

00:32:15
BRIAN COCHRAN Sure. 

00:32:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, that’s great. Umm… are there signs or signals that you can think of that would tell you this is not a safe person for me to talk with? 

00:32:25
BRIAN COCHRAN Umm… a lot of this is the flip side of the safety signals and you know, I think about this in many ways as umm… minorities are kind of constantly sensing out in the world what’s gonna be a safe space, what’s not gonna be a safe space and a lot of that is intuitive. Umm… and you’re kind of picking up on people’s implicit biases even what they may not be aware and so things that might indicate that the person would not be a safe person is if their language is really riddled with a lot of kind of heterosexist assumptions about the world. If umm… they kind of ask questions in a way that doesn’t really open and affirm identities. If they feel uncomfortable talking about sexual identity or sexual behavior, that would certainly be an indicator. Umm… certainly, if they are relying on their clients to educate them or if they are kind of drawing out a lot of information that you feel like, they should know. Umm… maybe if they are conflating concepts that are distinctly different like conflating sexual orientation and gender identity or umm… perhaps the worst scenario might be if they are making everything that you’re coming in for in counseling about your sexual orientation or gender identity when it’s not really related to that. 

00:33:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:33:30
BRIAN COCHRAN So see everything through that lens as if that’s the primary problem that they want to work on. I think those should all be signs of, this is not a safe person to work with. 

00:33:40
VERONICA JOHNSON That makes a lot of sense. It, it’s about attending to the person. 

00:33:45
BRIAN COCHRAN Sure. 

00:33:45
VERONICA JOHNSON And all of the identities that they bring with them to the counseling relationship, yeah. Thank you. Umm… if a counselor were experiencing a value conflict, how do you think you might experience that as a client? 

00:34:00
BRIAN COCHRAN Oh, yeah, from, from a client’s perspective, I think umm… the counselor wouldn’t be present. I mean, they would be really preoccupied in terms of their own struggle with what they were going through understanding and resolving their values and they certainly wouldn’t feel like they were umm… able to be present with this kind of micro skills of reflecting, listening, being there with you, tracking what you’re saying. Umm… you might feel that they’re trying to push you in certain ways that are discordant with your identity or umm… that they are trying to kind of normalize you in certain ways with regard to your sexual orientation or gender identity or putting a template or stereotype on you that doesn’t really umm… accurately denote who you are. So I think those might be ways that, that umm… conflict might play out. 

00:34:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. Yeah, that make sense. Okay. If you put all the legal and ethical issues aside? If you and your partner imagine or seeking counseling, say it’s for umm… a sexual related issue and you sense that the counselor was not affirming of your identity. Would you want a referral and then as a, as a follow up to that, would you, would you want to work with that counselor? 

00:35:10
BRIAN COCHRAN I think, if I really sense that this was impairing the counselor’s ability to work with even certainly, I would not want to work with that person. I’d prefer to work with someone who umm… it really wasn’t an issue for them to work with an LGBT individual. 

00:35:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:35:20
BRIAN COCHRAN I want to feel like umm… they are able to bring all of their skills as a counselor and as a therapist to the room without being impeded by their own biases and, and if they were experiencing that sort of values conflict, there is no way that they’d be able to be fully present as a therapist. So yeah, I would, I would really want a referral. I’d rather work with someone who is more competent in working with LGBT people. 

00:35:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. Sure. I’m aware that you’re the clinic, director of clinical training of the psychology doctoral program here at the university of Montana. And that affirmative therapy is the favorite approach for sexually diverse clients. Umm… do you think that if a therapist doesn’t have a background in affirmative therapy that they can still provide competent services to umm… sexually diverse clients? 

00:36:10
BRIAN COCHRAN Yeah, I think that’s a great question. LGBT affirmative therapy is pretty new. So of all the practicing therapists that are out there right now, I think only a minority of them have really received any specific course work or training in LGBT affirmative therapy. So my hope is that of course, there are a lot of people out there who are competent to work with LGBT individuals who may not have had that specific training and my encouragement of course for all therapists and as a director of clinical training and as a practicing clinician myself is to continue umm… the process of education of oneself and through continuing education workshops, doing a lot of reading and then of course and consultation and supervisions which are ways that we umm… draw upon the wisdom of other people who really have the expertise in that area. So I wouldn’t say that someone is not competent on the basis of not receiving that training simply because most people haven’t. Umm… but my hope is that, that will change in the future and that counselors and therapists are really going to make sure that they do everything they can do prepare themselves for working with diverse clients. 

00:37:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Okay. Thank you so much for being a part of this interview and for what you shared. 

00:37:10
BRIAN COCHRAN Absolutely. You’re welcome. Thank you for including me. 

00:37:10
VERONICA JOHNSON You’re welcome. Now let’s watch John interview a Native American colleague of ours, Maegan Rides At The Door. On her perspective, on getting counseling and possible referrals and on sensitivity to counselor behaviors. 

00:37:30
Interview with Maegan and John 

00:37:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I’m delighted and honored to have with me to interview Maegan Rides At The Door. Maegan is the director of the National Native Children’s Trauma Center here on campus at the University of Montana. Maegan thank you for spending a little bit of time with me. 

00:37:45
MAEGAN Yes. 

00:37:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN First question. You ready? 

00:37:50
MAEGAN Sure. 

00:37:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. How would it be for you if you were working with a counselor or a therapist in a first session and because of some competency limitations, let’s say, you had a problem with uh… addictions or an eating disorder and because of that, the counselor or the therapist suggested a referral that you see someone else. How would that feel to you? 

00:38:20
MAEGAN I suppose that would feel all right. It makes sense that someone may not know everything about everything. And so I feel, it would likely stir up some issues, I’m wondering who the next person would be but I feel like I would have some understanding about what that you maybe limited in and it might be thinking about my care of making sure that someone with the competence would be able to help me. 

00:38:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So it would make sense to you. Uh… even though, then it would get you thinking about, well, who will this next person be but it would at least make some food rational sense to you. 

00:39:05
MAEGAN Yes. And we have an established uh… relationship yet so I feel like it, it wouldn’t be that impactful. 

00:39:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So the timing might be good too. Okay, great. Umm… how about if the referral was more based on conflicting values? For example, the person maybe says, umm… I don’t work with uh… Native Americans on communication issues or I don’t work with uh… people who have different sexual orientations. What would be your reaction to that kind of a referral? 

00:39:45
MAEGAN Well, I would immediately start to think about umm… you as a person and I think at first, I would wonder about that some more. And then later on as I continue to reflect on that, I’m starting to think well maybe, it would be good, maybe it’s good thing that you’re referring me to someone else. 

00:40:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:40:15
MAEGAN In the case that you are able to help me due to a values conflict. 

00:40:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, okay. Yeah, so your first reaction is, it would make you start to wonder about me as, as the therapist. Umm… but maybe a little later, you’d be thinking, no, maybe this is a good thing. Yeah. 

00:40:30
MAEGAN Yeah. 

00:40:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. In either case, any kind of referral, uh… what do you think would be a nice sensitive, helpful way for uh… counselor or psychotherapists to make a referral or refer you to someone else? 

00:40:50
MAEGAN I think that goes back to what I was talking about a little earlier was that, it would be helpful to frame things in terms of what is going to be more helpful for me and having some kind of rational umm… is better than no rational. 

00:41:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Good, yeah. 

00:41:10
MAEGAN And providing more explanation umm… would be helpful in trying to problem solve because I do see referral as a collaborative process. So that I imagine before you make the referral, you already have somebody in mind umm… and not just one person but maybe a few people umm… so that we could talk about what the options are. 

00:41:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:41:40
MAEGAN Umm… and so that I have a little bit of a choice in the matter of what, what’s gonna happen in the next steps. 

00:41:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. That’s, those are great ideas. So really, it’s a matter of providing an explanation and one that really is framed as, this is in your best interest, for your well-being and then maybe not to say uh… you should see somebody else and not to say one person but to give you a menu maybe of possible people who might be a good fit for you to help you with whatever specific issues, you want to work on. Okay. Got it. As a person uh… as a minority person uh… a Native American woman, what are some of the signs or signals that you noticed in counselor or therapists that tell you this is a safe person with whom I can work? 

00:42:35
MAEGAN I think some of the signs are if the counselor is knowledgeable, has some basic knowledge about my culture, where I come from. It’s helpful to know when I say where I’m from or something about my background that the counselor can connect with me in some way. Umm… it’s safe to talk. I feel like it allows me to talk more if I can sense that the person has an understanding without having to ask me all the questions, ask, begin a line of questioning about my background and spend a lot of time trying to gather information from me. 

00:43:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, yeah, so if they are not really using you as a major source of information and they seem like well, heck, they know something, they’ve got some knowledge. Yeah. 

00:43:25
MAEGAN And maybe, if I knew umm… at the beginning of our relationship if they have helped other American Indian or Alaska native. 

00:43:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, one of the things that I’ve read is that, that is recommended. I’ve read several things that are recommended. But one of them that I read which seems umm… like it might be related to what you’re saying is to engage in a little bit more small talk or chitchat at the beginning and maybe talk about, oh, yeah, do you, I, I know a woman named uh… Selina, you know and or I know someone who I think might be from the same tribe as you and to engage in that, would you see that as useful? 

00:44:10
MAEGAN Yes. Most definitely. Most, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with umm… and get some background of where, where you’re coming from and you know, if you’ve actually been, been in a tribal community or have attended cultural events and to have some background of what your exposure has been. 

00:44:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. To know a little bit about whether or not I have had, yeah, who I know, who I’ve worked with, yeah. Good. How about the signs, the signals uh… that I might not be a safe or be useful, helpful person for you to work with? 

00:44:55
MAEGAN Again, I would say somebody who has to rely on me to provide information or somebody who is relying on stereotypes umm… and not coming from a place of trying, trying to see if that fits. Umm… not, not coming from a place of making assumptions about who I am just because of my cultural background. 

00:45:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. What if you picked up on some of those uh… stereotyping statements? Umm… would that be a situation where you’d maybe want a referral? 

00:45:30
MAEGAN It would depend on the type, it would depend on the context of the situation but it could potentially lead to that. 

00:45:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:45:40
MAEGAN Yes. 

00:45:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Where… 

00:45:40
MAEGAN It could and it could potentially lead to the client not even asking for a referral but just not, just not engaging at all and making their own self-referral to someone else. 

00:45:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Maybe just disengaged from the process. Maybe not come back for a session too. Yeah, okay. This feels a little redundant but I’m gonna ask you anyway. So if the, if the counselor, therapist was feeling or having a values conflict, right umm… what would that experience be like for you? What do you think, it would feel like in the room? 

00:46:20
MAEGAN I imagine that it would be an unsafe situation and uncomfortable. It would be an uncomfortable atmosphere. There would be tension in the room and there would be a lot of umm… time for the client to think about. For me it would be thinking about what should I say? Should I confront this person, should I not confront this person? Should I let them know what I’m thinking and be, and be truthful about that and that would largely depend on how long we had been seeing each other. Umm… and the nature of our relationship. But there would be some decision making going on that, some tough decisions about should I confront this person or not. 

00:47:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN In some way, that puts uh… some ways that puts a lot of pressure on you. You’re thinking uh… should I confront them, should I speak up, should I how should I deal with this? 

00:47:25
MAEGAN And what’s gonna happen if I do? 

00:47:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, what’s gonna happen if I do. Do you have any other thoughts on this series of questions or the issues that we’ve been talking about? Anything that you would like to add? 

00:47:35
MAEGAN I would say largely this is very contextual in terms of I’m thinking of, in rural reservation communities where the service providers are really low and so you don’t have a lot of referrals sources within these communities and so it’s being able, that’s what makes it so important to think about, well who then would you refer to? 

00:48:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:48:05
MAEGAN In a given situation or umm… if you were having some kind of values conflict to really think about where you’re, where you’re providing services in the population that you’re serving and if the availability of services was in the community. 

00:48:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. That’s a, that’s a great point. Yeah. Maegan, thank you very much for taking the time to share your thoughts and perspective with us. 

00:48:35
MAEGAN Thank you for having me. 

00:48:40
Debriefing of Interviews with Brian and Maegan 

00:48:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Roni, we just got a chance to interview Brian Cochran and Maegan Rides At The Door and I, I just want to share with you my number one take away. 

00:48:50
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

00:48:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… and that is Brian talks so clearly about how judgment from the therapist could feed right into that history of being bullied and judged and socially ostracized that people who are LGBT may have experienced in their history. And then I thought that really Maegan was in some way saying the same thing and that is, if she sensed some judgment or stereotypical language and she didn’t mention intergenerational trauma but my sense is that it would put her on high alert because she’d be sensing and expecting maybe some kind of mistreatment that is historical really for a Native American people, intergenerational trauma. 

00:49:45
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes. One of the things, I also heard that I thought was important that Maegan said is that she would lose confidence in her therapist, her counselor if she sensed that there was judgment or lack of acceptance of her cultural identity and her world view and her experience. 

00:50:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, right and I think both of them were talking about those safe signs, those signs of a safe counselor which are sometimes subtle and sometimes not so subtle. Right. 

00:50:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think uh… it was interesting how Maegan was uh… very much in support of that uh… chitchat. Most talk about people who you know who might be in different tribes and doing that ahead of time so that she would know a little bit more about the counselor. 

00:50:35
VERONICA JOHNSON Maegan also mentioned a couple of times how it would be important for her to not feel as though she had to educate her counselor about her culture. 

00:50:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:50:45
VERONICA JOHNSON And, and that’s a tricky one, I think because we want to understand clients for their own world view but then it’s also important to have some basic foundational knowledge about where a client is coming from. Brian mentioned, he would be sensitive to signs around the counselor’s office that would tell him that like counselor has some knowledge or some awareness around his sexual identity. 

00:51:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, right. Those signs or signals are very important. And then the final thing, that’s a take away for me as I listened to them is that obviously, no single counselor or psychotherapist can have all of the cultural competence needed uh… it’s work. I’m aware in Montana, the, the crow tribe is a tribe with whom I have had some contact and some familiarity. But that’s just, that’s one. Right and there are, there is diversity among tribes. Uh… I’m aware of so many different kinds of intersecting identities among people who we might put under the umbrella as being sexually diverse and we can’t know all those things. We can’t umm… be up to speed on all the different cultural groups and so it’s just ongoing work and so for me, it seems like having the attitude that yeah, I’m gonna do the work, to learn what I need to learn to be the best counselor, I can be for you. 

00:52:15
VERONICA JOHNSON And what you just said really tells me that you would want to be collaborative with your client. 

00:52:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:52:20
VERONICA JOHNSON And acknowledge what you know and what you don’t know and invite their perspective but still take responsibility for what you don’t know and what you still have to learn. And I think that sharing with the client that you really want to be the best counselor that you can be for them builds the relationship and, and increases your, their perceived umm… confidence in you and, in your competence. 

00:52:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I remember an example from a long time ago when I was, a long time ago, because I remember, I was seeing a client who was in his 50s and I was probably in my 30s and I remember him coming in and saying, you don’t know much. You don’t know anything about being in your 50s. But there is this really great book, you should read this book. And I’ve said, absolutely, I should. Uh… and to me that’s part of the, that was a client initiated idea that I can collaborate on but I think sometimes there could be counselor initiated ways to collaborate, so that again I improve my competence and my capability to be a good counselor. Uh… and do that in partnership with the client. 

00:53:30
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes. 

00:53:30
Introduction to Session 

00:53:30
John and Maggie 

00:53:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hey Roni, full disclosure. I am feeling pretty nervous about this next segment. 

00:53:40
VERONICA JOHNSON What do you feel nervous about? 

00:53:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I’m feeling nervous first because I’ll be doing a live demonstration interview with a woman whom I do not know. So that’s scary. But also I’m aware that you and our guest person on this show professor Emeritus Dr. Rita Sommers-Flanagan will be evaluating my performance during that live demonstration and she’s kind of scary. 

00:54:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah, she’s kind of scary but we’ll try to be supportive. 

00:54:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thanks for that. 

00:54:10
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. You’re welcome. If you’re watching, try to notice what John does that you think he does especially well and also try to notice some things that maybe you think he could do a little better. Umm… John is gonna be interviewing a woman named Maggie who is coming to him to talk about some relationship issues. Let’s watch. 

00:54:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Maggie, now that we’ve taken care of all the paperwork uh… I see that on the intake form, you listed that your goal is to work on some relationship issues. And so I would just love to hear more about what relationship issues are for you. 

00:54:50
MAGGIE Yeah. Umm… so I have been in my current relationship for about three years now. Umm… and it’s a really great relationship. Umm… I think we have a really solid friendship. Umm… but there is, there is some intimacy issues umm… that I’m having troubling figuring out him to like to work through. Umm… and I’m having trouble talking to my partner Emily about it. Umm… so yeah, I don’t really know where to start with that. 

00:55:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, okay. Yeah, so the first thing I hear you saying is that pretty positive relationship. You, you feel good about the relationship. 

00:55:35
MAGGIE Yes. 

00:55:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… it’s with Emily. 

00:55:40
MAGGIE Yes. 

00:55:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And that there is some intimacy issues and when you say intimacy I’m thinking maybe sexual related thing. 

00:55:50
MAGGIE Yeah, yeah. So umm… mostly I would say the biggest issue is being coming up as umm… me wanting to be, want intimate or have more sex umm… and her, me feeling like she’s not umm… wanting the, the same umm… and unsure of why. Not sure, how to talk about that. 

00:56:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. So some of it has to do with communication around sexual and the frequency and I hear you saying maybe you would like to have sex more often than she does and now the talking about that is, is a challenge. 

00:56:40
MAGGIE Yeah, yeah because I don’t, I don’t want to make her feel bad about it but I also don’t know why that’s happening. So, yeah, I just don’t know what to do about that. 

00:56:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Kind of hit a dead end. 

00:56:55
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:57:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… a wall and you’re not sure what to do next. Yeah. Is, is it okay with you if I just tell you if I’m just really honest about my reaction. 

00:57:05
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:57:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Umm… my reaction is that I have worked with couples and I have worked with couples on communication and that feels pretty comfortable to me. Umm… but to be perfectly honest and I, and I, and I just want to be with you. I have not working with lesbian couple umm… around sexual issues in particular. 

00:57:30
MAGGIE Okay. 

00:57:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… and so what, what I would like to do, I mean, I would, I would like to be the best counselor I can be for you in the situation you’re in. Umm… but I just have to say I’m not completely up to speed. 

00:57:55
MAGGIE Okay. 

00:57:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:57:55
MAGGIE Well, thank you for being honest about that. 

00:57:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:58:00
MAGGIE Umm… is, is there someone, you might refer me to? 

00:58:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You see, that was the next thing, I was gonna bring up. 

00:58:05
MAGGIE Okay. 

00:58:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… is that uh… I’m willing, I know, this is a mental health clinic. I know, that there are limited resources here in this small community. And although, I can think of a couple of other people who we might have you go see umm… I also just want to kind of partner with you in the decision making process, in that umm… I’m willing to work with you or to try to work with you as best I can, I would need to do some reading, I would need to do some work to kind of catch up on, you know, what are the useful approaches that people use with lesbian couples as opposed to heterosexual couples. Umm… on the other hand, I totally am open to identifying a good referral. 

00:58:55
MAGGIE Okay. 

00:59:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I don’t want to put a lot of pressure on you. And say, oh, you need to pick in the moment. 

00:59:00
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:59:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… and so maybe if before you even tell me what you’d want, let’s just talk for a few minutes about what you would like in a counselor. 

00:59:15
MAGGIE Sure, that sounds good. 

00:59:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN In general. 

00:59:15
MAGGIE Yeah. 

00:59:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then we can kind of come back around to the issue of whether I’m that person or whether we find someone who is a better fit for you. 

00:59:20
MAGGIE Okay. 

00:59:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What would you, what kind of things do you imagine being helpful to you in a counseling relationship? 

00:59:30
MAGGIE Umm… I think someone who mostly, I feel comfortable with umm… I think that’s, that’s a big one clearly but umm… someone who, I mean, I think that umm… no one is going to, you know, know everything about umm… my situation or anyone’s situation. So just someone who is, you know, is happy to listen and learn umm… and yeah, is, is open. 

01:00:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Okay, yeah, so what I hear you saying, number one, somebody I’m comfortable with. Number two, kind of acknowledge is important but it’s not a deal breaker. 

01:00:15
MAGGIE Yes, yeah. 

01:00:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It’s somebody who is open to you and what you have to say maybe a good listener can understand or try to understand what’s happening in your relationship and inside you. Those are important things. 

01:00:35
MAGGIE Yeah. 

01:00:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Yeah. I have an idea umm… and again if it’s okay with you I’ll just share it. 

01:00:40
MAGGIE Sure. 

01:00:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… one thought, I have is that uh… I do have a couple of people in mind who might be a good fit for you. But I’m wondering if we might just continue our session now since we had it scheduled. Umm… as if we’re gonna continue together. 

01:01:00
MAGGIE Okay. 

01:01:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then we end and you go maybe go home and talk it over with Emily or just think about it yourself for a while and then you contact me and if you would like a referral, you can come back free of charge and I will identify a person. We’ll talk about why that person might be a good fit. And yet if you decide nah, I don’t really, you know, I don’t really need a referral. We just set up a second appointment. Then we just go from there. 

01:01:30
MAGGIE Okay. That sounds really great. 

01:01:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:01:30
MAGGIE Okay. 

01:01:35
Debriefing of Session 

01:01:40
VERONICA JOHNSON I’m very excited to introduce a guest to our video Dr. Rita Sommers-Flanagan Professor Emeritus of Counsel of Education at the University of Montana. Thanks for being here Rita. 

01:01:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You’re so welcome. And I wasn’t really directing. I was just being doctor bossy pants. I do want to say that Roni is one of my protégés. I’m very proud to have her in this video. 

01:02:05
VERONICA JOHNSON And thanks you Maggie for being willing to share some of your time with us and experience with John for a few minutes. 

01:02:10
MAGGIE Of course. 

01:02:10
VERONICA JOHNSON Umm… we just want to get a sense of what the experience was like for you and if anything in particular stood out that you’d like to share with us. 

01:02:20
MAGGIE Sure. Umm… so I really enjoyed how John umm… as a, as a counselor acknowledges limitations of experience. Umm… it was really refreshing. I definitely had experiences where the counselor, psychologist umm… He’s kind of assumed authority or umm… uh… role of uh… assumption and so it was really umm… it felt like it kind of evened the playing field of umm… the relationship between the two of us and it kind of made, it made me feel more at ease to know umm… where he was coming from. 

01:03:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. So it felt collaborative to you, is what I’m hearing. 

01:03:10
MAGGIE Yeah. 

01:03:10
VERONICA JOHNSON You felt like, you were part of the process and you got a say in, in what happened. 

01:03:15
MAGGIE Mm-hmm. 

01:03:15
VERONICA JOHNSON Was there anything in particular that he did that helped you to feel as though, you were really a part of what was happening and you got a say in, in the way you proceeded with counseling? 

01:03:25
MAGGIE Umm… yeah, so his acknowledgement of his lack of experience umm… counseling umm… lesbian couples uh… really helped me feel at ease and umm… feel like we could discuss where we wanted to go from there. If I wanted to continue working with him or if he could maybe make a referral for me. Umm… but it really helped me feel at ease and feel ownership over the process. Umm… I really appreciate it. 

01:04:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So I have a question. I think umm… if, so John offered to continue that session, to give you some time to think about it. And I worry a little bit about clients who might feel obligated or a little bit guilty if they come back because he’s a nice guy and, and you like that sort of empowerment. But in reality, you would also have more work to do to have John be effective than if there were someone in the vicinity that worked more specifically in areas where you wanted to do some work. So it’s a, it’s a quandary. 

01:04:45
MAGGIE Yeah. Definitely and I felt that in the moment when he asked me which I would want to do and I think maybe when you come to umm… a therapist or a counselor, psychologist often it’s incredibly hard just to get there and sit down and umm… I think in certain way, I kind of wanted him to just say like, okay, I’m gonna refer you to someone who knows maybe or has more experience. Umm… so yeah, it was both. I both appreciated his openness umm… and I, I almost felt like, I needed him to take an action umm… but 

01:05:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, I’m sorry, go ahead. 

01:05:35
MAGGIE Oh, no. 

01:05:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you did such a great job of, a very brave job of saying, I’m in a relationship where I have some unmet sexual needs and it, it got taken to communication and you agreed with that. But umm… one might also speculate that maybe technique or some other issues that a heterosexual male may really not, you were gentle. You were umm… but the issues of expertise with hinge a little bit around what it was, you needed and that got, that got put a little bit on you but… 

01:06:20
MAGGIE Yeah. Umm… I did like however though that John kind of wanted to establish a relationship between the two of us just based on us as people first umm… and then maybe move towards more in-depth expertise because I think perhaps uh… jumping right into that right away would be a little overwhelming for, for me. I wouldn’t necessarily, I would want to establish a relationship first before getting into all of that. Umm… so I actually appreciated that. Umm… but yeah, maybe down the line that would definitely be something. 

01:07:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. So that might be kind of a slow referral where you took advantage of John knowing some people in town and spring board sort of referral that in an instant, yeah. 

01:07:20
MAGGIE Yeah and I, I think that can happen umm… with lots of people first coming, coming to counseling umm… or therapy. I, I think it’s probably unlikely for your first person to be the right fit umm… so yeah, just kind of establishing it as a process is, is good and helpful but also umm… in a lot of ways, the therapist does have expertise around uh… referring and figuring out the right fit. Umm… so I would like for John to maybe kind of take some direction around that. 

01:08:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:08:05
MAGGIE Yeah. 

01:08:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So it’s his job, his job to help you articulate what you need but ultimately he’s the one supposedly trained credential getting paid, that’s his job. 

01:08:20
MAGGIE Yeah. 

01:08:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:08:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Thank you for what you shared. Is there anything else that you feel like is, is really important for us to know about your experience today? 

01:08:35
MAGGIE It felt really wonderful for John to umm… to acknowledge where he’s coming from and establish kind of uh… uh… piece of comfort umm… as opposed to umm… just kind of taking up space with maybe his knowledge or his expertise. So I, that was uh… very comforting and refreshing. Umm… so I really appreciated that. 

01:09:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thanks. 

01:09:10
VERONICA JOHNSON Thank you. 

01:09:15
Debriefing of Session with John, Rita and Roni 

01:09:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well John, here I am, your dreaded critic. Seriously, how was that for you? 

01:09:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, I thought it went pretty well. Uh… I was just watching as you guys debriefed with Maggie and I was quite relieved that she found my disclosure, my openness around the limits of my competence to be uh… in some ways really reassuring to her. She said, refreshing, I guess and, and so that felt good. 

01:09:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. 

01:09:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And uh… to be honest, there are things that happened as I was going through the process that I didn’t expect and maybe the number one thing that happened was I realized, as I was saying, umm… it would be okay for you to work with me but let’s talk about it maybe you want a referral. I realized in the moment that I, I’m holding power. 

01:10:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh yeah. 

01:10:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that part of holding that power is that I can push her to choose me in the moment especially because I felt like I could pressure her and in my reaction to that was to really pull back and say, but of course, we could just not have you make that decision right now. Let’s give it some more time. 

01:10:35
VERONICA JOHNSON I really liked your choice to say, don’t do this, don’t make this decision right now but let’s just continue and get to know each other a little bit and then you can take some time to think about this. I could also see a counselor wanting to influence the client to not choose them in the case that it’s a value’s conflict. 

01:10:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. 

01:10:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Please don’t choose me. I’m gonna refer you to somebody else and it’s, it’s nice to hear you say, you felt that pull to encourage her to choose you and while you were trying to pull yourself back from that, that’s still an indication that you were, you were building a relationship with her while acknowledging that you didn’t have the skill set necessarily or the knowledge that you might need to be as useful to her as perhaps somebody else. 

01:11:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And what was, another interesting part of it for me is that it felt good to share that limitation rather than to keep it secret, you know, to, to say well, of course uh… I can help you with those sexuality issues. It felt good to just be open about it and let’s see if we can work it or not. It really seem pretty, pretty good. 

01:11:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It seemed to me like now I’m thinking as I hear you two that you could have also said, you gave her time. You could have given yourself time as a counselor and said, you know, this is something probably we should both consider and, and because it’s a tough decision and if you were a graduate student or a young counselor, you might want to get supervision to, to really think it through. So one of the important things that is always at the top of the priority list is client welfare. So buying yourself a little time and her. Roni, what did you think about him offering a free consultation time later to, to make the decision or to refer? 

01:12:35
VERONICA JOHNSON I thought, it was respectful of the client’s umm… autonomy that she could come back, that she wouldn’t have to pay, that she could work, continue to work with John to make the referral. Umm… I think that, that was the responsible thing to do. I wanted to go back to one thing and that’s your choice to share with her your umm… your lack of skill or knowledge and issue that she presented. Because we do have to make the distinction between a skill’s based competence referral and then a value’s based competence referral. 

01:13:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:13:10
VERONICA JOHNSON And if this were a value’s based conflict that you were having that was, that was leading you to consider whether or not you were the right fit for her, I think you might have made a different choice about the way that you share that with her. And so in this example, I think, you did a really nice job of being honest and umm… authentic with her and I think she really appreciated that and if the situation were a little different and it were that you had a different umm… value that maybe was not affirmative of the sexual minority client that it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to disclose that to her or at least, you would disclose something different that would be affirming of her identity and not place the responsibility of the referral on her. 

01:13:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So true. If it’s my issue, I need to be responsible for it and not blame her and yet if the issue is I have a value that I think uh… lesbian people are living in sin, right or whatever it is that I might think depending on uh… particular perspective that I hold. I need to make sure that I’m not retraumatizing her because of course the culture probably has given her that message off and on and it’s probably been hurtful to her. And so even if it was a value issue for me I would try to say, I don’t have experience working with lesbian women on sexual relationships. I think, I could find a good referral for you, someone who is a better fit. But leave the values piece out. Another example. Uh… oftentimes, we have counter transference reactions, right and one counter-transference reaction might be to feel really attracted to someone. I’m not gonna say, I feel so attracted to you that I can’t work with you. But I’m gonna say, you know, I got some personal issues that I’m dealing with and that I think it makes it so that I’m not the best counselor for you at this point in time. But these are some issues, I need to deal with and work through. In the meantime, I can and would like to work with you to have the best referral fit of the counselor that’s best for you as possible. 

01:15:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I like that you allow some time to make that referral and to decide if the referral was the best thing because it’s also possible that you have some work to do that you decide to get your own counseling or therapy or that you decide to engage in supervision with someone in order to monitor your, your work with this client and, and be the best counselor that you can be. I think there are things that you can do prior to making that decision to ultimately refer that can help you work on what is that you’re struggling with. If it’s a value based or a skill based referral or area of incompetence. 

01:16:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, the other thing that I think is really important, we haven’t talked about. We’re talking now about how to do sensitive and compassionate and skillful referrals. But another thing is really important is informed consent, right. I may have an informed consent that identifies my religious orientation and maybe that is part of the message of who I am as a counselor. So that client who read my informed consent can already know and understand what my world view is and then maybe choose me because the world view is in sync with theirs and maybe avoid me if my world view is not in sync with theirs. So I think informed consent is a really important piece that can be proactive and preventative in terms of having too many values based conflicts with clients because if it’s a repetitive thing, then we need to do something proactive to make sure that we’re not luring clients in who are just a bad fit for us and then we are referring and rejecting them in some kinds of destructive ways. 

01:17:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Luring clients in is definitely not ethical. Another thing umm… that I, I’m aware of now is we always teach that self-disclosure on our part as the professional is always, always in the service of the client and the therapy relationship. It’s never to get something off our chest. Umm… and so I think in situations where it would be umm… a difficult self-disclosing, you need to get supervision first and find a way, like Brian said earlier today, it is not the client’s fault if you need to make a referral and so being very, very careful about how we disclose and getting supervision even if you’re a seasoned professional can be a good idea. 

01:17:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And really the first steps in that process and like you were saying, maybe it’s gonna take a little while and maybe it’s gonna take supervision and consultation. But I need to do my good active listening. I need to be empathic. I need to do a first session uh… in the most respectful and positive way, I can and then maybe consult to see huh, how do I talk about this with my best way of protecting the client’s welfare. 

01:18:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:18:20
VERONICA JOHNSON And whether you’ve disclosed any kind of world view or value in your informed consent document or not. It’s a process, informed consent is a process that continues throughout the counseling relationship. So you might be confronted with a client issue that you weren’t prepared for, that surprises you. 

01:18:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:18:40
VERONICA JOHNSON And you may need to engage the client and the process of informed consent to determine what the best course of action is. 

01:18:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

01:18:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It’s not an easy process but it’s one that’s very, very important to our profession and to the welfare of our clients. 

01:18:55
Social Media and Boundaries 

01:19:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hey Roni, are you on Facebook? 

01:19:00
VERONICA JOHNSON I am. 

01:19:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Will you be my Facebook friend? 

01:19:05
VERONICA JOHNSON We are Facebook friends. 

01:19:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, how about, what if I was your client? 

01:19:10
VERONICA JOHNSON No. 

01:19:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Come on, it’s just Facebook. Everybody is on Facebook. Everybody knows what everybody is doing on Facebook. 

01:19:15
VERONICA JOHNSON That is true and if you were my client, we’d have to have a conversation about appropriate boundaries when it comes to social media. 

01:19:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… and if I was your client I’d probably say, what’s the big deal. 

01:19:25
VERONICA JOHNSON And I would probably say, let’s talk about what the big deal is and how important it is that we maintain a professional relationship and often Facebook isn’t professional. Facebook is often pretty personal from a lot of people. 

01:19:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You make a good point. In this next segment, Roni and Rita will be interviewing two graduate students Kindle(ph) Lewis and Joey Moore(ph) about the cutting-edge issues around social media and counseling and psychotherapy. 

01:20:00
VERONICA JOHNSON We’re pleased to have Joey Moore and Kindle Lewis joining Rita and I in this discussion about social media and boundaries as it relates to professional counseling and psychotherapy. Thank you Kindle and thank you Joey for joining us. We have some questions for you. The first question is what role do you think social media plays in the types of information that we collect and access about clients when we are establishing a relationship with them as part of that assessment process that we do? 

01:20:35
UNKNOWN Well, from my perspective, it plays. Umm… it plays a very minimal role. Umm… mainly because I think that in order to access a client’s social media, we have to have a discussion with them about that. So I don’t think it should ever be prior to that discussion and in my opinion, I think that when we do access it, it should be accessed with the client so that we are not making assumptions about what we’re seeing. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN I think, I’d echo that. I don’t know that I’ve ever accessed the client’s Facebook or social media account. Uh… we know, it’s a thing umm… and I don’t see there is a real big part of uh… my work with clients. But we do mention it informed consent in the… We do mention that in the informed consent uh… only because it is a thing. 

01:21:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So I, I have a, an old question, question. Umm… when you say social media, I’m guessing you youngsters mean Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and whatever it is that you do over and over again is that, it’s, it’s on app or something? What is that thing? Anyway, so that’s social media, right Roni. 

01:21:55
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:22:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But Googling someone in my nomenclature at this point, does, does not necessarily mean accessing their social media. Is that true or am I off on how I define this? 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN I think you point out something that’s really important uh… and that is majority is, at least, it seems to me that the majority of practicing counselors don’t have a real tight grasp or real familiarity with how technology these days work specifically social media. So Googling somebody can indeed put you in contact with their social media accounts across all types of platforms and apps. I’m against that. Part of that is because I don’t want to be exposed to any information that could skew my feelings or create any biases with my client in a space where I don’t have an opportunity to talk with them about that. So I’m not gonna look. Umm… if you’re dealing with a high profile client or somebody who is potentially in the media, I think that changes a little bit. Only in that, he’s been exposed already and if you can’t bracket or ethically manage your own feelings towards whatever that situation is or the notoriety then it might be a good idea to refer them to somebody else. 

01:23:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Interesting. You have a reaction to that. 

01:23:30
VERONICA JOHNSON I, I do and I think you make a really important point that there is a distinction between managing information that you, that, that you come into contact with involuntarily and then seeking it out. 

01:23:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:23:45
VERONICA JOHNSON And I think the seeking it out piece is what you two are really reflecting on as an invasion of privacy. 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. It definitely feels like that. And to clarify that Google question, it does put you in contact with their social media but only if you choose to click on that, right. It could come up with Joey Moore Facebook blah-blah. Umm… and then it would be my decision to click on it or not and I think it relates back to that like what is the purpose of looking at their social media? Why are we trying to investigate this? Is that our role and then in my opinion, no, it’s not. 

01:24:20
UNKNOWN I think, it goes a step further to going along with that. As counselors, many of us have social media accounts. We have these things that are attached to us already and what could seem like maybe a harmless event on a social media platform, on Facebook for example, could end up being something that damages the client and we must always put our clients first. We need to protect them. So when I’m talking on Facebook, you want to use proper grammar things like that. You also want to use words that if they were published or worth a headline for tomorrow’s paper, would protect the client, protect you, protect their confidentiality. Uh…, you never know who knows someone else. Uh… you could know your client through a friend of a friend of a friend and never know that or have any idea about that until you mention something that to you or to anybody else would seem innocuous and it completely describes or discloses your client and your relationship which would be a violation of our ethics. 

01:25:35
UNKNOWN I think what you touched on there is particularly irrelevant and we’re all in small communities as well because yeah, you’re gonna be linked to people just inevitably because you know, certain degrees of separation, now whatever. But especially, you live in a small community, umm… accessing social media and not creating those clear boundaries between professional and personal and not understanding how social media works umm… just opens the door for ethical violations, dual roles, seeing information of clients that you do not want to see. 

01:26:05
UNKNOWN Or vice versa. 

01:26:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, and vice versa. 

01:26:05
UNKNOWN Having a client see information about you that may not be part of your public persona. So I think in that case, it might be important intentional for a practicing counselor, specifically in a rural setting or even some place like here, to have both a private, professional or private personal page and a professional page and keeping in mind that the pictures regardless of your security signs, they are gonna be available. So you’re gonna want professional headshot not you on your yacht or your boat last fishing season slamming a 40. 

01:26:50
UNKNOWN You on your yacht. What kind of counselor might you making their buddy. 

01:26:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, it really raises issues that we have not fully resolved and the problem is the technology is advancing so quickly. I want to tell you a little story. There is a school district that we’ve consulted with and as everybody knows uh… it’s, it’s terrifying that we have so many young people attempting suicide and committing suicide. In this particular school district was contemplating uh… handbook type set of rules that would put all of the teachers and staff responsible for any posting on the internet of any of the kids in the school or any of their homework assignments that hinted at suicide or deep depression and they were to respond to it uh… any time day or night. I was like, this is burn out city first. No one can be responsible that many hours of the day but is that even uh… an appropriate assessment? Are we accountable for that level of information and disclosure and the school counselor is especially have a terrible job to know how much they should know from who, when and how accountable, they are. But that’s the, that’s the one of the many uh… conflicts. I tend to think, well, I remember back in the day before much existed and teachers thought, they could keep students from texting. It’s like, and so I think oh, yeah, how are you gonna keep clients from stalking us on Facebook. Maybe that’s wrong word. Being aware of us on Facebook. How are we and I hate to admit this on an ethics but I might Google a client for various reasons. But one thing I promise is that it will be in my informed consent. It will be in the way I practice. I’m not a sneaky person. But I might be curious and I might be worried about information that somehow, I should know that will help me do better work. 

01:29:15
VERONICA JOHNSON And my initial reaction to that is that oh, my gosh, it’s not only invasion of privacy but then, it obligates you to this responsibility that if you have access to this information, then you have to do something. 

01:29:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I know that second one. 

01:29:30
VERONICA JOHNSON But then, you say the informed consent piece and I think, okay, well at least, you’re not being sneaky about it. But then I still worry about as you said, burnout as a concern and if we are disclosing that we want access and that we will access information about our clients online, then what are the limits and what is the frequency and the duration and the depth of knowledge that we have access to that our client is not directly providing us. 

01:30:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But do you think of, you guys think of yourselves having privacy anyway with any of the stuff you put online? 

01:30:10
UNKNOWN That’s a great question and that is why I don’t have social media. Umm… no I don’t, I think once you post on social media, you have to recognize that, that is out there and it’s public. 

01:30:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It’s totally public. 

01:30:20
UNKNOWN Even if you have your privacy settings locked down which is very important to know about. That’s, it’s still out there. So creating a professional page and a personal page is great and a very smart way to approach this and you have to recognize that whatever you’re posting on your personal page could potentially be viewed, right. 

01:30:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I’ve noticed over the years, recent years graduate students who had Facebook pages that were just free for alls. Suddenly, their names changed. No longer somebody with a last name, they were somebody with the middle and no last name and I thought, oh, yeah that really protects you, you know. But when you said, privacy and invasion of privacy, I thought, it’s like reading the newspaper. It’s like turning the radio on. So how accountable do I want to be? That’s a whole different issue. 

01:31:05
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:31:10
UNKNOWN I can see your points. I can see your point and I still agree with Roni that I think it’s an invasion of privacy. Umm… mainly because going back to that assumption. We’re collecting information on a client and then we are assuming what that information means about them. And then lastly, you have a discussion with the client about it or you know, do it with them, look at the information with them or skewing our image of them. 

01:31:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I like that idea that look actually look with them and certainly young clients want you to sometimes to see their latest Instagram. So that’s certainly a possibility. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN It happened umm… it happened with my work with students. That they’ll bring things voluntarily and they want to show it and it is in my informed consent. I say, I have social media. I have setting set so that only people close to me can actually send a request to friend. Uh… and on top of that we talk about it. We talk about it in the beginning, we talk about it through the middle and we talk about it at the end. That I have social media. I expect that you probably do. We’re not gonna be friends on social media. We’re not gonna talk about things that we would talk about here on social media. If you friend request me, I won’t accept it and we’re gonna talk about it later. And then at the end of our time that conversation usually looks very similar. Now that doesn’t mean that it’s okay for you to go ahead and friend request me. The same rules still exist and we’re just not gonna do that. So it’s, it’s very much kind of once a client, always a client. And I think that, that’s the best way that I can protect them and myself ultimately. You never know what could happen uh… when you’re working with all different ages. Umm… drugs and alcohol play a role and many people have heard of drunk texts. So you can get drunk Facebook messages. What happens, if you get a drunk Facebook message from a client at 2:30 in the morning who’s contemplating suicide. What is my responsibility then? Umm… it just seems like a rabbit hole for me and the easiest thing is to really just kind of lock that up. The unmentionables and manageable, let mention it, let’s talk about it, let’s manage it. 

01:33:30
VERONICA JOHNSON I like that approach and my concern with having access and discussing access to social media or any technology resource online with clients is that the client might choose that as a avenue to disclose information and then I have to be receptive of that information in some way and if I’m not, could that make me liable for any information that I don’t have that then has pretty significant consequences for the client. So I, I would be concerned about accessing that information or the client counting on me accessing that information even if we’ve talked about it. 

01:34:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I think that’s a huge piece of that informed consent, right is going over, this is not a platform for you to reach out to me for counseling, for therapeutic needs. 

01:34:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Yes. 

01:34:20
UNKNOWN This is not a place for you to reach out for emergencies. Right, so you have to have that conversation with them and going back to the, to the school example, I think currently the best practice is for the school itself to have a page which the school counselor could operate. Umm… but it’s very, very locked down. So there is no posting on the school page wall or someone has to be monitoring that all the time right because if a kid post on there like yeah, I’m, I’m having trouble with drugs or whatever, then it is the responsibility of the school to address that. 

01:34:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So really what we’re seeing is good boundaries, good informed consent and authentic discussion that may have to happen more than once about the counselor’s choices around the use. 

01:35:05
UNKNOWN I would add even that if you say, you’ll do something you should do it. So… 

01:35:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Be careful what you promise. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Right. If you say, exactly, if you say, you won’t friend them and they friend you and you say, you won’t accept it and you do, you’re violating the boundaries that you’ve set. Umm… and then again that can get real big, real fast. When considering technology even emails and cell phones things like that, a client emails you, you know, we use email for scheduling purposes only and invariably you always have a client who is going to want to talk content in an email and so then you wonder about the responsibility for that content? How faster you getting back to them? What happens with that and so again coming back to the informed consent, I only check my email every 48 hours. You’ll get a response within 48 hours. And if you send me content, I will respond not to the content but the enquiry and we’ll talk about it later in a session. 

01:36:20
UNKNOWN I think the idea of setting that boundary like or setting the lines of this is my policy and I’m sticking to it is incredibly important when you’re working in a school because you encounter so many people right. So if you make an exception for the mom of Zaly(ph) but no one else right there is of course going to get around the school and become a big problem. 

01:36:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It gets around the community too. It’s really, humans are humans. We live in this little communities and, and word gets out if you break boundaries, then the expectations you’ll break them for the special client. 

01:36:50
UNKNOWN Right. And what does it mean for our relationship if I told Joey, we cannot be friends but then I friend Rita, my other client. 

01:37:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh it’s, it’s a big mess. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN Me and Rita are friend. Then I see that Rita is now your friend and you won’t friend me but you’ll friend her. 

01:37:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Joey, I like you all but we’ll bring this to a close. Thank you so much for taking time to talk about this. It’s important, it ever changing, good job putting it on the agenda. 

01:37:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Thanks. 

01:37:20
UNKNOWN You’re welcome. 

01:37:25
Closing Remarks 

01:37:25
John and Roni 

01:37:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN We have now come to almost the end of our ethics video together. And Roni one of the things that I like to ask people at the end of a counseling session is what do you remember 0or what do you want to remember from our time together? And so let me ask you that? 

01:37:45
VERONICA JOHNSON I’m gonna remember that I need to always monitor my self-awareness and my level of competence and I think that comes from continued practice, ongoing supervision, reflection, uh… consultation and just growing and ongoing monitoring of myself in session with the client. Myself out of session with a client, myself in supervision, in consultation just ongoing, self-monitoring. 

01:38:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, so lots of self-monitoring, self-reflection. 

01:38:20
VERONICA JOHNSON Yup. That’s what I’m gonna remember. What are you gonna remember? 

01:38:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I am going to remember that it’s all about competence and more competence and the way, I think of competence is that we have to be competent to remember to be self-reflective and know how to be doing self-monitoring as you said, Roni. We need to be competent to understand how to use the skills to do the sensitive, a compassionate and a helpful referral. We need to be competent in order to know how to do an initial informed consent and what’s include in it. We need to know how to do ongoing informed consent and of course, a lot of that’s process but a lot of that is skill too. We need to be competent to include some information on social media in our informed consent. But also to know how to use skills that are kind and yet also limit setting when it comes to setting limits on social media with clients and so for me, a lot of it is skill based and experiential and it is evidence of competence even though a lot of it is self-awareness and self-monitoring but I think those skills are so important. 

01:39:40
VERONICA JOHNSON Yeah. And you know, at the base, at the foundation of our competency is, is awareness and just being mindful what presses our buttons and recognizing when those buttons get pressed and staying present with the client. It’s sort of that simultaneous self and other awareness that we need to practice and become skilled at in our work with clients. 

01:40:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And one of the things I’m aware of right now Roni is that even though our time together on this video is ending. Uh… the learning really never ends and so I hope for those people who have been viewing that this video will help contribute to your lifelong learning about ethics. 

01:40:25
VERONICA JOHNSON Thanks for watching.
