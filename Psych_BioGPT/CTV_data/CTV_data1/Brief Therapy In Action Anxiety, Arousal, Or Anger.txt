00:00:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Hi Melissa. 

00:00:25
MELISSA Hi. 

00:00:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Maybe, one place for us to begin in the time that we have, can you tell me something about why you've come in? Ah, what would you like to get in the limited time we have together? What would you like to get out of that time? 

00:00:40
MELISSA Well, any kind of advice, uhm, or technique that I could learn to use to maybe manage some anxiety I'm having or some stress, right now would be good. 

00:00:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:00:55
MELISSA Uhm that would probably be the first reason I came in. Uhm, and then also because this, this I hear is, ah, very good experience to have, and, and so I thought I should take advantage of it. 

00:01:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Which is a good experience? 

00:01:10
MELISSA Meeting you. 

00:01:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I see. (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
MELISSA Coming in and... (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN 'Coz meeting me is magic or. 

00:01:15
MELISSA (laughs) Well, not you in particular. I didn't know I was gonna be meeting you. (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. 

00:01:15
MELISSA But, uhm, just, ah, having somebody as qualified as you coming in, uhm, so I thought I should take advantage of that. 

00:01:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. But the major thing then is some things to do about anxiety. 

00:01:30
MELISSA  Yeah. 

00:01:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. What would you like to learn to control? What about anxiety would you like to deal with? Anxiety is a big term. 

00:01:50
MELISSA Probably, uhm, the effects that it has on me, uhm, in terms of the way I act when I'm feeling a lot of anxiety. For instance, it brings out, uhm, it brings out my temper, where I can't, I can't deal with things as well as I like to instead of talking to people or communicating, ah, ah, to people, you know, what I need, I yell instead, you know, and, and I'd really like to learn some techniques to control that. 

00:02:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh-huh. So when you get stressed, you lose your temper? 

00:02:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  That is one thing that happens. 

00:02:30
MELISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And when you lose your temper, you say things or do things that, but don't help or it may even hurt. 

00:02:35
MELISSA  Yeah. 

00:02:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. What else about anxiety would you like to learn about or, or learn to deal with? 

00:02:45
MELISSA  Uhm, really that's, that's about it. Just, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Controlling your temper when you get anxious? 

00:02:55
MELISSA The temper issue, yeah. 

00:02:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Well, maybe it would help me, uhm, people respond to things either in a number of different ways as you probably know. What does it take, ah, from zero to ten, zero, you know, so on, it's you, you open your eyes in the morning and you're already anxious. Ah, ten is, oh, God, it takes, ah, ah, national disaster to get you anxious. 

00:03:25
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What does it take to get you anxious? 

00:03:30
MELISSA Oh, I've, probably about a four. (laughs) 

00:03:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  About a four. Okay. So what will be an example of something that would raise your anxiety enough so that you lose your temper? 

00:03:45
MELISSA It could be a car pulling out in front of me on my way to work. Uhm, it could just be, uhm, I live at home right now with my parents and my two brothers and it could be, uhm, a simple thing like, ah, one of my brothers goes in my room and, and maybe leaves his laundry in there or something, and, you know, an invasion of privacy or something like that. Uhm, it's just that's enough to set it, set it off, you know. 

00:04:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  So, if you're driving to work and someone pulls out in front of you without looking or, you know, not giving you the right of way, you would get anxious then angry. 

00:04:25
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:04:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And what would you do? 

00:04:25
MELISSA  It would just, it would just kinda, you know, build up inside, the anger, you know, to where it's, uhm, you know, you feel your heart racing and, and you're thinking, you know, constantly swearing at the guy, and he can't hear you, 'coz he's, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Right. 

00:04:40
MELISSA  couple of cars ahead of you, so it, it's just, uhm, you know, I realize I shouldn't be doing that while I'm doing it, but it's like, you know, it's so hard to control it. It just kinda happen. 

00:04:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It just happens. So it's not just anxiety but the anger, how to control the anger? 

00:05:00
MELISSA Right. 

00:05:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Is this, ah, a new problem? Something that just started with you, or is this... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
MELISSA No. 

00:05:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...an old pattern? 

00:05:05
MELISSA  Yes. This is, this is, uhm, for as long as I can remember, I've always been like this. 

00:05:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  How far back? Ah, can you remember being, you know, a two-year-old and someone took your toy, and. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
MELISSA  Uhm, probably not that far back. Uhm, more like in my teen years. 

00:05:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Can you think of an example of what happened in your teens when you got anxious and angry? 

00:05:30
MELISSA  Oh sure, uhm, ah, see, well, ah, see, my, my, ah, my parents had separated when I was a, when I was a teenager, so, uhm, that made me very anxious. Uhm, and then when my father came back, I kinda harbored a lot of resentment towards him, so, you know, if he walked in the room and said something, you know, maybe it wasn't even meant to be a negative comment, but I took it that way. Uhm, that could set me off and, and I'd start feeling all anxious and get really angry at him, and he didn't necessarily do anything, it was just, you know, a feeling I was having. 

00:06:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So he might, you'd be watching television, he'd walk in the room and say, ah, "What are you watching, Melissa," and you'd get furious? 

00:06:20
MELISSA No, nothing like that. It would maybe be, ah, uhm, I don't know, like "Why are you watching this?" or "I wanna watch the game," or something and he'd walk over the TV and just turn it off and, you know, I mean, it was ignorance on his part but my behavior towards him wasn't exactly good either, I mean. 

00:06:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Let me just see if I understand. It, it wasn't simply that he said something but he said something that intruded on your world. 

00:06:50
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Okay. And when your brother leaves laundry in your room, the invasion of privacy is an intrusion into your world. 

00:07:00
MELISSA Right. 

00:07:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  And when someone cuts out in front of you, it's in the same kind of way an intrusion into your space. 

00:07:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN "Hey, that was my space and... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:07:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...you, you've taken it." Am I hearing you right, Melissa, that what gets you most angry is when people intrude on your space? 

00:07:20
MELISSA That's true. 

00:07:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  All right? 

00:07:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Does that always make you angry or there are times that you get less angry or probably more angry? 

00:07:35
MELISSA No, there are times that I can, then I can deal with people doing things like that, ah, for instance, at work, where I kinda have to be more in control. You know, if a customer comes to my teller window and he's yelling for some reason or another because the ATM machine outside isn't working, you know. It's not my fault but I have to bite my tongue and that's, you know, let that anger out. And the way that I'm used to letting it out would stay in my father or my brothers, uhm, or somebody on the road that I don't know. So, no, there are times that I can, that I can, ah, deal with it. Well, I don't really think I'm dealing with it in the right way but there are times that I bite my tongue and, and don't let it get the best of me. 

00:08:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So the customer comes in and says, "You know, the ATM machine is not working." Ah, you don't say, "Well, try sticking your tongue in it or something," and, (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
MELISSA (laughs) 

00:08:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...you know, you, (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
MELISSA No. 

00:08:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN you wouldn't be rude. 

00:08:25
MELISSA No. 

00:08:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But if your brother does something, you might be more forceful? 

00:08:30
MELISSA Right. Yeah, I'm more likely to put him in his place. 

00:08:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Why is this a problem that you wanna deal with? I mean, you've been doing it a long time, and. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
MELISSA  Yeah, well, (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What, what? What's your motivation to change it at this point? 

00:08:40
MELISSA ...well, basically, uhm, I don't like the kind of person I am, when that anger comes out. It's, it's not a very nice person, you know, it's, it's, uhm, you know, ah, it's, it's a person who is yelling and then swearing and it's just not good, you know. It's, I, I think I just have a really bad temper and, uhm, I mean, I've already learned that it's okay to have anger and it's okay to express it but it's just the way I'm doing it, you know, I think is the problem. 

00:09:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Okay. What I'd like you to do, Melissa, I'm gonna ask you in a moment to close your eyes. Don't do it yet. Let me tell you what I want you to do. Close your eyes and I want you to picture the image of the person who handles their anger well. So if you could handle your anger the way you think you should, I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes and picture that and describe it so I know what your goal or ideal would be. 

00:09:45
MELISSA Okay. 

00:09:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Now close your eyes and picture that. And you come into your room and there's your brother's laundry. 

00:09:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN How would you handle it if you were that different person you would like to be? 

00:10:00
MELISSA Well, I wouldn't start yelling and screaming right off the bat. I'd, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Explain to me what you would do. 

00:10:05
MELISSA Uhm. Probably ask them to pick it up or, ah, ask them a question why they did it in the first place. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, so you say, "Gee, why is your laundry in my room?" and you say, and your brother says, "Coz I felt like leaving it there." 

00:10:25
MELISSA ...yeah. That would, you see, right there, I wouldn't know what to say just because, right, I, I, 'coz I don't know how to, to handle it, you know, so I, I'd, I wouldn't know what to say. 

00:10:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So you know you'd like to be different, but it's not clear to you how different would look. 

00:10:45
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:10:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  'Coz, ah, ah, as I ask you how would you handle it in that other way, whatever that other way is, you're not quite sure what it would look like. 

00:10:55
MELISSA  Yeah, that's true 'coz I, I really, the, the people that, that live in the house with me, you know, people I've grown up with, they're pretty much the same way, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So you come by it honestly. 

00:11:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. Yeah, my whole family is pretty much the same way. So it's not like I can look at somebody that's close to me and say, "Oh, okay, I see what I'm doing wrong, you know, it, it's not like I've had a good example set. 

00:11:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So we know what you don't wanna be. You don't wanna be like all of them. 

00:11:25
MELISSA Right. Yeah. 

00:11:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But you're not sure what you do wanna be. 

00:11:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Uhm, I don't know. Ah, do you see yourself as Mother Theresa? 

00:11:35
MELISSA No. 

00:11:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN No. 

00:11:35
MELISSA (laughs) 

00:11:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So that's an extreme. You don't wanna be that good. 

00:11:40
MELISSA No. 

00:11:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But you don't wanna be the way you see yourself to be. 

00:11:45
MELISSA Right. 

00:11:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So somewhere between Melissa and Mother Theresa, that's something. 

00:11:45
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Do you have an idea? Ah, not in your family necessarily but of anyone that you know where you say to yourself, "Well if only I could be like him or her or whoever it is." 

00:12:00
MELISSA  Uhm, I've had a couple of friends in the past who have been able to handle stressful situations pretty well. Uhm, rarely see them explode and, and get angry, ah, they're probably better communicators than I am. Uhm, I'm sure that helps, you know, being able to talk about things rather than just argue about them and yell. Uhm, so I guess if I had to look for a pattern to try to, you know, to try to be like somebody, I would be somebody like, ah, somebody like that, somebody. (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You have ah, you have a person in mind, though. 

00:12:45
MELISSA  Uhm, yeah, I, I guess I have. I had a girlfriend once who is, who is like that. 

00:12:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Let's make of a name first. We don't have to even name her. Let's make of a name. 

00:12:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Think of a name for her so we can refer her. 

00:13:00
MELISSA Carrie. 

00:13:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Carrie. Okay. So if you could be like Carrie, what would you look like? You come into your room, your brother's laundry is there, and you say, "Why is this here?" he says, "Coz I, he says, I dropped it and decide to leave it there," and Carrie would say, what? 

00:13:15
MELISSA  Well, "Pick it up please and don't do it again," and she'd probably use a calmer tone and, and, ah, wouldn't use any vulgarities, that's for sure, I mean, she wouldn't, you know, she would just be calm and, and, you know, forceful at the same time but she would get her point across, uhm. Of course, she is, doesn't live in the same household I do, and. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Right. 

00:13:45
MELISSA That's a problem too, you know, it's, then. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
MELISSA The people I live with don't necessarily responds to you even if when you do speak calmly and, and rationally towards them. 

00:13:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Do they respond better when you yell or curse or. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
MELISSA No. That's. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, so yelling, cursing, caring, that doesn't have a huge positive effect. 

00:14:05
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And talking gently and calmly doesn't have a great effect. 

00:14:10
MELISSA Not too much. 

00:14:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, so there isn't all that you gonna do that's gonna have an effect, is that right? 

00:14:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:14:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. What you're describing if I'm hearing you right, Melissa, is that what you've learned over many years is an aggressive style as opposed to what you described with your friend Carrie as a more assertive style. Do you, do you understand the difference... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...between those two? Tell me back what you understand the difference between those two to be. 

00:14:40
MELISSA Between an aggressive style and an assertive? 

00:14:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yeah. 

00:14:40
MELISSA  Well, an aggressive would probably be somebody who is more like me where you, you just kinda reach out and grab at things, you know, you, you don't really think about the consequences or just kinda speak what's on your mind and, and don't worry about how the effect is gonna have on anybody else, even yourself at times you know. 

00:15:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. 

00:15:05
MELISSA Uhm, someone who's more assertive probably get their point across better. Uhm, and whatever they were meaning to do would probably come across, it, it would just probably happen more for them than would from somebody who's more aggressive. 

00:15:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. 

00:15:30
MELISSA I don't know, it's. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  That you'll be able to get more of what you want without all the upset. 

00:15:35
MELISSA  Yeah. 

00:15:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Without the yelling or screaming or cursing, whatever it is. 

00:15:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:15:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  'Coz what I hear you saying is that you don't like you that way? 

00:15:45
MELISSA Oh no, I don't. Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  So if you could be different you might like you better? 

00:15:50
MELISSA  Uhm, I like me fine, it's just that when I, when I do blow up, you know, ah, I don't like that. You know, I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You don't like that part of you? 

00:16:00
MELISSA Right, right. 

00:16:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. ah, ah, I appreciate just separating those two things out, keeping me on target. So it's not that you don't like Melissa, you don't like you, there's a part of you said "gee, I wish were different?" 

00:16:15
MELISSA Right. 

00:16:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN "I'm not pleased with that." 

00:16:15
MELISSA Right. And I really think that if I could change it that I would be, uhm, more, you know, just a healthier person and I could have healthier relationships then, I think it would just help out there in the long run. 

00:16:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
MELISSA So. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Probably less strain on your digestive tract and... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
MELISSA Oh sure, yeah. 

00:16:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...you hold a lot less strain on your body. 

00:16:40
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Well, let's talk about some things that you might look at, ah, ways of starting to think about that. One of the things that I think would be an interesting experiment, you said you like science, you told me that before we went on camera, you like science. 

00:17:00
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would you be interested in trying an experiment, a scientific experiment? 

00:17:05
MELISSA Maybe. (laughs) 

00:17:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  All right we'll do the experiment is, (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
MELISSA Okay. 

00:17:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I have a hunch, I have a hypothesis, we'd be very scientific. 

00:17:15
MELISSA Okay. 

00:17:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I have a hypothesis that the people you live with are used to seeing you in a different way, a, a certain way. 

00:17:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And that if you were different they might have some trouble with that. That's my hunch. 

00:17:30
MELISSA Okay. 

00:17:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What do you think so far? 

00:17:35
MELISSA You could be right. 

00:17:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. So that if suddenly you came home tonight and you found your brother's laundry in your room and you handled it differently than you usually do, ah, for example, uhm, well let's compare two things. We'll set up this experiment. You're smart enough, you're getting interested in this. 

00:18:00
MELISSA Yeah, yeah I am. 

00:18:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You are, huh? Okay, uhm, you come home tonight and there's your brother's laundry in your room, what would you normally say? 

00:18:15
MELISSA Uhm, I would probably start yelling or snapping at him and... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Do, do. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
MELISSA ...saying... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would you, show me exactly what you do? 

00:18:20
MELISSA Oh, I would... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  I'm your brother, what would you do? 

00:18:25
MELISSA (laughs) Uhm, take the laundry, throw it at him, tell him you know, get out of my room... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Take the laundry just throw it at him? 

00:18:35
MELISSA Yeah, it would, it would get. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You would say, "what, what the hell you're doing this for?" (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
MELISSA Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:18:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It really gets me angry, what, what would you say then? 

00:18:40
MELISSA I can go up on him. I mean, you know. I would just tell him, you know, stay out of my room, you know, what are you doing, you know. 

00:18:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You'd raise your voice. 

00:18:50
MELISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You'd curse? 

00:18:50
MELISSA Definitely, yeah. 

00:18:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Definitely. 

00:18:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN We don't want to do that on tape? 

00:18:55
MELISSA No, I. (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It will definitely not be on tape. And he's used to your doing that? 

00:19:00
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  But he leaves his laundry there anyway or does other things... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
MELISSA Other things that yeah... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...that, that gets you just as upset? What do you think would happen if when that happens you find he does something that you act as if you were Carrie? You act, ah, you could play a role. You say, okay I'm gonna act Carrieesk. I'm gonna act as I think Carrie would? Ah, your brother's name? 

00:19:35
MELISSA Jeff. 

00:19:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Jeff. "Jeff, uhm, I really don't appreciate you leaving your laundry in my room. Ah, I would appreciate you taking it out now, ah, thank you." No cursing, no yelling, eye contact, how would Jeff react? 

00:19:55
MELISSA It's hard to say, uhm, like you said he's kinda used to my behavior being a certain way, uhm, I really don't think he takes me seriously at all. 

00:20:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But what if you acted Carrieesk? 

00:20:10
MELISSA Uhm, it's hard to say. He eat my work. I mean, I, I, it, it could. If it were something that was a little bit more, you know, not the laundry thing, something a little bit more drastic you know. Ah, I don't know that he would act any different. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
MELISSA If I was calm with him. 

00:20:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Do you think if you were calm and collected and focused and you kept doing that for a while he'd, what would he say, "Mom, something wrong with Melissa, she's not feeling well. She's too calm. She's not yelling. She's not cursing." Do you think they'd think there's something wrong with you? 

00:20:45
MELISSA Yeah they, they might. (laughs) 

00:20:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, here's my hunch. My hunch is that people used to seeing you a certain way and it might be some interesting data for you to act differently and evaluate the result of your different action, to see how people react, your family, in particular... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...react to you acting differently. 

00:21:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It's an experiment. My hunch is they wouldn't get upset. Because they're used to seeing you in a certain way and the way they use to see you is the way that, that part of you you don't like. Ah, am I hearing you right? 

00:21:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So it would be interesting because the hunch I have is somehow there's an interaction that keeps you doing stuff that you're not happy with. You think that's possible? 

00:21:40
MELISSA Sure. 

00:21:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would you be willing to try that as an experiment? 

00:21:45
MELISSA Yes. 

00:21:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN For a couple of days, just "Jeff ah, I don't appreciate when you leave your stuff in my room" or "Jeff I don't appreciate you taking things that belong to me, uhm, I would prefer that you don't do that and if would you please stay out of my room, thank you" over. That's it. 

00:22:10
MELISSA Okay I'll try it. Give it a shot. 

00:22:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What, what's your prediction on what will happen. Let us try to think through, what would you predict to happen? 

00:22:20
MELISSA Well, it couldn't get any worse. 

00:22:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Okay, so you can't lose anything by that? 

00:22:25
MELISSA Right. 

00:22:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, so that's good news. Well, what's your prediction though here Melissa? 

00:22:30
MELISSA Well, ah, my prediction probably will be that he, uhm, might wanna do what I asked him just because I'm not yelling at him. You know, little brothers, you know how they are, they're just defiant. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
MELISSA When you're young you tell them, they wanna do the exact opposite of what you're telling them not to do. So I'm sure, I mean he, he could, he could. 

00:22:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, one possibility is you're gonna shake up the system, right? 

00:23:00
MELISSA Sure, yeah. 

00:23:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And that'll be interesting data. This is an experiment. 

00:23:00
MELISSA  Hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Interesting data for you to use in, in your counseling work, to see, you know, what, what would you discover from that experiment. It would be interesting to see. One of the things I would, I wanna, I wanna make sure I explained to you is that in situations like this, uhm, there are certain things you can expect. If you stop interacting that way, in the old way, the way that you're not happy about. 

00:23:35
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  The first thing you're gonna see is a slight increase. And ideally that's what you're gonna get, ideally. But understand initially what's gonna happen. You may get more the very thing you're trying to stop. 

00:24:00
MELISSA  Okay. 

00:24:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And if you keep being calmer, there, there is gonna be an escalation or go let's gets her, let's get her back yelling and cursing and carrying on coz that's our Melissa. You may get an escalation initially. 

00:24:20
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And then when people find it's not so much fun anymore because you're acting differently. You'll have to be less angry. I'm suggesting you act less angry. 

00:24:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Do you understand the difference here? 

00:24:35
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:24:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And the goal is what? Let me just go over there again. 

00:24:35
MELISSA  And the goal is to be calmer and get my point across, not blow up. 

00:24:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And the goal of trying this experiment is what? 

00:24:45
MELISSA  Is to talk to the people I'm around differently. 

00:24:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Right, and to evaluate how they respond to a different Melissa. They may come to you and say, "Are, are you feeling okay? 

00:25:05
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Coz' you're not yelling or cursing the way you're suppose to." So that's one thing you can try... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...as an experiment. There's another piece, that I'm, I'm thinking about the, I'd like to, ah, how do you look at and that has to do with the way that any of us process information that you said on a, it's kinda moment(ph) idea, you are forced, so it doesn't get a whole lot to get you going. 

00:25:35
MELISSA  Right. 

00:25:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I, I wonder what are you thinking about? What thoughts do you have? What goes on your head that then leads to anger? For example, if you were to get a phone call. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  I'm gonna write that down, there's a phone call. And someone says, "Melissa, please come to a party." Would that make you angry? 

00:26:15
MELISSA No. 

00:26:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN No. Well, how, how would you end up feeling? 

00:26:20
MELISSA I'll feel good. 

00:26:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Feel good. Okay. Let's suppose you got a phone call, I was going to write down "call" and someone says to you I would like you to come to a party, uhm, we don't especially want you but we need some more women. Okay? 

00:26:45
MELISSA Okay. 

00:26:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So that's a, b, how would you end up feeling? 

00:26:50
MELISSA Uhm, I wouldn't get real angry but I just kinda go like, ah, you know, like kind of appalled you know, like the nerve. 

00:26:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Okay, appalled, okay. Let's suppose you get a call and you end up angry, what do you think would have to happen here to make you angry? Can you give me an example of what would make you angry? 

00:27:15
MELISSA Yeah, when I get the message in the first place. 

00:27:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, ah, missed message and you'd be angry? 

00:27:20
MELISSA  Oh, sure. 

00:27:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Because you'd be saying what to yourself. What would you say to yourself that would then lead to your being angry here, Melissa? 

00:27:30
MELISSA Uhm, well like I said I, I live in a household with five other people so, uhm, I'm not so just to me are important, you know, because they are part of my life, you know, I. (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yes. 

00:27:45
MELISSA Some people calling me a different, about different things. So if you're not, if I'm not getting one of my messages that it would just, not getting it makes me angry because I feel like I'm not getting the respect that I think I should have. Ah, especially when I'm the kind of person who would do something like that for the other members in the house. Uhm, it makes that, that it makes me even more angry when I, when I think of it that way. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  So two things that would get you angry is when you say to yourself "I'm not getting respect." 

00:28:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN That would make you angry? 

00:28:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Is that right? If you say to yourself I would do it for them and they don't reciprocate for me. 

00:28:35
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN That would make you angry, is that right? 

00:28:40
MELISSA Right. 

00:28:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Can you make an example of another thing that you might end up saying to yourself that would lead you being angry? 

00:28:45
MELISSA  Uhm, not really, not, not about that, no. 

00:28:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Oh, about anything. 

00:28:55
MELISSA Oh. 

00:28:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Could you think of something that you would think that would end up with your being angry about it? Let me give you another example. 

00:29:05
MELISSA Okay. 

00:29:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uhm, you're driving to work and saw a car in front of you. 

00:29:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And if you say what, ah, what an awful driver then that's it. Would you be angry? 

00:29:20
MELISSA Would I be angry? Uhm, yeah, I probably would, yes. 

00:29:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Because? 

00:29:25
MELISSA Ah, because I can't live with stupidity of some people. It... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Wait. 

00:29:30
MELISSA ...gets on my nerves. 

00:29:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN If you say people should not be stupid and they should not drive in a particular way, you get angry? 

00:29:40
MELISSA Uhm, I get angry when I see people endangering the lives of others that make me angrier no matter what. So, it could be on that road, it could be with anything. It could be, it could be anything, it could be seeing, a, a mother with her kid in a store and, and she's not holding on to his hand and he's only two years old. That makes me angry. 

00:30:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Is it what you see that gets you angry? Or is it the way you process it internally that gets you angry? 

00:30:05
MELISSA I think it's the way I process it... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yeah. 

00:30:10
MELISSA ...'coz probably somebody else could be looking at it and, and thinking something totally different or you know maybe, its, somebody else's isn't, that's not making them angry. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
MELISSA You know. So. 

00:30:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, part of, of the difficulty is not simply what you see but how you process what you see? 

00:30:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:30:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Is, is that, am, am I hearing you right on that? 

00:30:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. So, if you could process it differently, what affect do you think that would have? 

00:30:40
MELISSA Well, I'm sure, that they would help but, I mean, you're gonna have your certain feelings. So, if it's a feeling that you have and it's strong, I mean, I don't think there's really any other way to process it. Either, I mean, take for instance, uhm, if, if I'm seeing somebody that's driving on the road and they're, I don't know, they're weaving in and out of lanes or whatever. Uhm, I'm gonna process it the same way no matter what because it's a stupid thing to do, and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Right. 

00:31:10
MELISSA ...it's risking the lives of others. 

00:31:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You're right. If you said to yourself, that's a stupid thing to do, they're risking someone else's life. 

00:31:20
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN How inappropriate, how awful, you know, I'm gonna call the police and turn the, you know, if you have a car phone, don't you have a car phone? I'm gonna call the police and give them that guys number. 

00:31:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. But what you're describing is, you get furious and you start yelling and cursing that, of course, they can't hear you. 

00:31:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:31:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, you're paying a price and nothing happens to them. 

00:31:45
MELISSA Right. 

00:31:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But you're paying a price 'coz now your guts churning. 

00:31:45
MELISSA  Yeah. 

00:31:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, you're right. I think if we took a vote of anyone around that said, do you think dangerous drivers make you feel good? No, they scare me. 

00:32:00
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uhm, and I try to keep away from them. 

00:32:00
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  But I don't think everyone gets as angry as you do. And, that's 'coz people process it differently. My question for you is to identify the particular style of processing that you learned in your house. 

00:32:20
MELISSA What do you mean, style? 

00:32:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What you've described, Melissa, is that, everyone in your house, acts pretty much the same way. 

00:32:25
MELISSA  Oh, yeah. 

00:32:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So this is a style of your family? 

00:32:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Uhm, did you ever see the movie, Annie Hall with Woody Allen on film? 

00:32:40
MELISSA No, I did not. 

00:32:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN No? 

00:32:40
MELISSA No. 

00:32:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN There's a wonderful scene that compares different family styles. Uhm, it's a split screen. 

00:32:45
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And on one-half the screen is Annie Hall, this, they're having a very quiet candle lit dinner and they're discussing politics and music and it's very quiet, very gentle dinner. And Woody Allen, his family lives under the roller coaster Connie Island. And it's noisy and there's yelling and there's arguing and you see two very different family styles. 

00:33:10
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And each family style is really generated by the kinds of ideas they have. Ah, so, if one believes, one family style is, people should say whatever's on their no matter what it is, you get people who are much more confrontational. 

00:33:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  On the other hand if you say, you should never discuss your feelings, you may get people who get ulcers or headaches or other kinds of problems. 

00:33:40
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, neither is an ideal but both reflect the way you see things. So, one of the questions I have for you is, what is there about your style, again, reflective of your family style... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...that leads to your being angry more than you'd like? 

00:34:00
MELISSA Uhm, well, probably the fact that they, ah, they are very impulsive, worse, if they, if something angers them, they're more like ready to just lash out rather than sit calmly and discuss something. There really aren't any discussions in my household, so. 

00:34:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Despite consequences? Hurt feelings? 

00:34:25
MELISSA And its rare. It's really rare. Its, uhm, there's not a whole lot of communication that goes on in the house, let's just put it that way. It's not very, uhm, its, it's not very, I don't think it's very healthy, you know, and. 

00:34:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  And you don't like that part of you? 

00:34:45
MELISSA Well, yeah, I don't like the effect on me actually in the setting in the first place. You know if I could be out of it, I would, but I can't really afford to move out right now. And, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN That's part of a whole different issue? 

00:34:55
MELISSA Yeah. And then, you know, the fact that I was raised that way as though, you know, rubbed off on me and, so, I don't like that but, uhm, I mean, I do see it. I see what's wrong and, and I, I do want to change it, uhm, but, wow. Trying to get to other people on the house to ah, acknowledge it is like forget it. 

00:35:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Why do they have to acknowledge it? 

00:35:20
MELISSA It's not that they have to but there had been times where it's come up, you know, and, and so, you know, I might say to somebody, you know, I see a lot of this in you too, you know, and I think could really learn, learn to communicate better yourselves or, or being just a. Maybe I'll say something like, why did you just lash out at me like that? You know when I do it, you know, you, you, you don't respond well to that. So, when you do it, you know, you're gonna get the same reaction from, from me, you know, so, they don't really, they don't really see it themselves. 

00:36:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yeah. Well, it will be interesting if you follow through on the experiment. What effect that'll have, if you start acting differently, oh, how, how they'll react to that. 

00:36:15
MELISSA  Well, I'll give it a try. 

00:36:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It should be interesting. 

00:36:20
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:36:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You have to think that, I think it would be helpful for you is to really begin to examine this process. The process that says, it doesn't matter what I say, you just be impulsive. Forget, don't worry about the consequences just get it off your chest as quickly as possible. And it's part of you that after you do it, you say, I don't like that much. 

00:36:45
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN That's not the way I want to be. 

00:36:45
MELISSA  Right. 

00:36:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN It's not the way I want people to see me. 

00:36:50
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And that's gonna be changing a part of you that's been around for a long time. 

00:36:55
MELISSA Yeah. Yeah, 'coz it's pretty much been like that since as long as I can remember. So. 

00:37:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN That's what you've said before. So, this is gonna be, uhm, a hard job. 

00:37:10
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Not an impossible job. But it's a hard job given that it's been going on for a long time. 

00:37:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:37:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  It means, changing something that's a part of you. That's a biggie. 

00:37:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. Yeah. But that's, that's why I'm here. 

00:37:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But are you willing to try to do that? 

00:37:35
MELISSA Oh, yeah, yeah. Definitely. 

00:37:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  If you could be more assertive, if you can be less volatile, would you feel better or worse about yourself? 

00:37:45
MELISSA  I could be more assertive? 

00:37:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yeah, ask what you want, say what you want without yelling and cursing. 

00:37:55
MELISSA Oh, yeah. Right. 

00:37:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would you feel better or worse about yourself? 

00:37:55
MELISSA I think I'd feel better. 

00:38:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Feel better. Would you be more pleased with yourself or more angry that you didn't get all your emotions out? 

00:38:05
MELISSA No. I'd, I'd be more pleased with myself. I'd still want to get all the emotions that I've having out just in a different way. 

00:38:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
MELISSA But, I'd be pleased with that if I could do that. 

00:38:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, that's something that you'd like to be able to do. 

00:38:20
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So, the motivation to do that's good. 

00:38:25
MELISSA Yeah, definitely. 

00:38:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. We'll see how your family likes that, a different you. How would your friends, do your friends? 

00:38:35
MELISSA My friends see this in me also. I have, uhm, a couple of very close friends they have been friends with for a lot of years and, and they see it in me too. 

00:38:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
MELISSA My temper and aggressiveness. 

00:38:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Would they like you better or, or, if, or would like better, or would it be better or worse in relating to them? 

00:38:55
MELISSA Uhm, well, with them, since I'm not around them as much as my family, that is big of an issue with them, you know. Uhm, I'm sure they would be happy for me if, if I, if I could learn to control my temper a bit but, uhm, it's not as big of an issue with them 'coz I just don't, I'm not around them enough to were I, I need to lash out at them or. 

00:39:20
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Would it affect the way you are in relationships with the people at work? 

00:39:25
MELISSA  Uhm, to a point. I, I, I think so, yeah, really you work, working with somebody, yeah, yeah, actually. See I, I haven't work in couple of years, I actually just got this job a couple of months ago so I, I, I expect I'm gonna, I'm gonna need to learn control with, with them as well 'coz I mean, I'm gonna, I'm with them five days out of the week, so. 

00:39:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Several hours a day. 

00:39:50
MELISSA  Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN How about in just other relationships? Is that something that would be helpful? 

00:39:55
MELISSA Oh, definitely, yeah. 

00:40:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN So this is something, so there are lots of reasons... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...to, to try to make this change. 

00:40:05
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN And, do you think this is a good time to try to do, do that? 

00:40:10
MELISSA It's a very good time. 

00:40:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Why? 

00:40:10
MELISSA  Well, I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN What makes it a good time? 

00:40:15
MELISSA ...going through a lot of changes myself and, uhm, uhm, just looking into the future, you know, I, I wanna to be able to have healthy relationships with all different kinds of people. So, uhm, I just feel, the way to do that, is to just learn to communicate better and, like I said, control my temper which I think is like the worse part about myself, so. 

00:40:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  Kind of make a list here of some things that, uhm, you can start to work on in, in the counseling work. One is, a term you've used several times, that's "communication." 

00:40:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN To communicate differently. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  And the key I think would be to be more assertive. Increase your assertive behavior and decrease the aggressive behavior. 

00:41:10
MELISSA Right. 

00:41:10
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would, would you agree with that? 

00:41:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:41:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. A second piece is to try out new ways of behaving. To do this little experiment at home... (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...to see what, what the result would be. It may have no result, they might not even notice. Let's suppose they don't even notice your being different, what would that say to you, Melissa? 

00:41:35
MELISSA  Ah, uhm. 

00:41:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You are working hard to be different they wouldn't even notice. 

00:41:45
MELISSA Yeah. It wouldn't really say too much I guess? I'd, ah, they would notice, they would notice. 

00:41:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay, they would notice. 

00:41:50
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:41:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN A third thing is to try to identify the process that then leads to anger. Understand what's going on your head that then gets you feeling angry. How are you seeing things. 

00:42:10
MELISSA  Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Would that make sense? 

00:42:15
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:42:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  So there are three pieces that you might work on in the ongoing counseling work you're doing. 

00:42:25
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Do those sound like reasonable things to work on? 

00:42:30
MELISSA Oh, yeah. 

00:42:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Our time is almost up, uhm, as we're coming to kind of close the session down, Melissa, how are you feeling about this session, the time we've spent? 

00:42:40
MELISSA Well, I'm feeling good. Uhm, I feel like I have a goal, uhm, the goal, the experiment that you gave me. So, that's good 'coz it gives me something to look forward to when I go home, as I look forward to going home. So, they'll be. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN But again, you can be a scientist now. 

00:42:55
MELISSA That's right. 

00:42:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I want you to be very scientific. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
MELISSA That's right. 

00:43:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN You're going to think, "how might I do this?", and you're gonna collect your data and record it, just even make some notes to yourself and bring it in for, for the counseling session, have your counselor or therapist, talk with you about that. That would be good to see. 

00:43:15
MELISSA Yeah, definitely. 

00:43:15
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. How else you, and any other things you're taking home with you today? 

00:43:20
MELISSA Uhm, no, just the goal would be the biggest, biggest part, yeah. 

00:43:30
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Which, which one really? 

00:43:30
MELISSA  The, the one with going home and trying to change my attitude. 

00:43:35
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. Try to be, try to act differently. 

00:43:40
MELISSA Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Okay. 

00:43:40
MELISSA Yeah. 

00:43:40
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I'm gonna give you this and you can take that home with you so... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
MELISSA Great. 

00:43:45
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN ...it'll be easier to remember. 

00:43:45
MELISSA Uh hmm. Thank you. 

00:43:50
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Before we end, did I say anything that upset you or hurt you or bothered you? 

00:43:55
MELISSA No, not at all. 

00:43:55
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN I always like to check before someone leaves in case I said something insulting. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
MELISSA Oh, no, no. 

00:44:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN Yeah? 

00:44:00
MELISSA No, I was very comfortable. So. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
DR. ARTHUR FREEMAN  You're comfortable? 

00:44:05
