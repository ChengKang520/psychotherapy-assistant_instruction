RICH SIMON So, welcome everyone. This is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. I want to welcome you to our series on helping parents today facing the dilemmas of 21st century child-rearing. Today, we are going to be talking with someone who really offers an alternative to the heavy emphasis on diagnosis, problem-solving in working with children today, whether it's in the schools, the emphasis on medications and all of some of what many think of as the prevailing woes of trying to help kids who are experiencing difficulties in life and has a very refreshing alternative approach to working with kids and parents and he's coming to us today from Finland and you'll be seeing his lovely face in a moment. You'll be seeing my lovely face in a still form on the screen. These international Skype calls turned out to be a little more difficulty with these this morning than we anticipated, but we have one of the more charming and reassuring faces we've had on this show and let me introduce that person and that face: Finnish psychiatrist Ben Furman. Ben, good morning! 

00:01:35
BEN FURMAN Good morning (inaudible ) you say. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON Yes, or whatever it is. I'm being—like a good American, I'm Americanocentric. You're six or seven hours ahead of me, whatever it is. You're at the tail-end of the Finnish winter and the beginning of the spring. Well, all right, let's just get right into it. So, so you're a psychiatrist and you know as well as I—probably better than I—this how the emphasis on diagnosis, the emphasis on medication and working with kids, so where is the roots of this 'kids skills' approach that we're going to be talking about today? Where did that come from? 

00:02:20
BEN FURMAN Well, I was really disillusioned with the way child psychiatry deals with children's problems here in Finland and this is a very psychoanalytic country, actually, so children, whatever problems they had were likely to end up going in some kind of a long-term therapy where they go for sometimes years, whereas maybe in some other countries it's more like they're given a lot of medication, kids. So, my interest was to develop something where children would be actively involved in solving their own problems. I think I was inspired by Milton Erikson(ph), the late hypnotist, and the family therapists, many of the early family therapists who actually liked the idea that children are active participants in solving their own problems, like basically it boils down down to 'so, kiddo, what do you think? What would be a good solution to your problem?’ And the child sort of feels, maybe feels even proud at the end of solving the problem and that's a little different way of thinking because very many people think that in order to solve children's problems, we somehow have to do something about the family or to fix the (inaudible ), you have to fix the relationship of the parents, and you kind of always have to fix something with the family and I've worked quite a bit over the year with teachers, with kindergarten teachers, preschool teachers, the people who work with teenagers and they cannot fix the families. They have to fix these things regardless of the family with these kids and I have been afraid like that if we focus too much on the family in helping children, we may actually throw the baby with the bath water—if we don't succeed in changing the family, then we stand there not knowing what to do, so maybe that is why I think it's interesting. 

00:04:20
RICH SIMON So what stands out for me, there are two things—and this is what I'd like to explore with you in our conversation today—is that you don't see yourself as, number one, solving problems and you have a different way of thinking about what your task is, so let's start with that. So, this is what you keep reiterating: you're not focusing on problems and this is what you write about and present, this is what you talk about—so what do you mean by that? How do you do therapy where you're not focused on solving problems? 

00:04:50
BEN FURMAN What a lovely question. Actually, you are solving problems, but it's just how you talk about problems. If you talk about problems, you approach a challenge and you say 'look, kiddo, you have a problem, that's a problem what you are doing,’ either a behavioral problem or an emotional problem, so many children shy away. They don't want to speak to you. 'I don't want to talk about it.’ They say 'I'm not interested’—children are not particularly interested in solving that. They aren't even interested in admitting that they have a problem and parents are a little bit the same. The parents, they don't like the idea. I usually ask people in my lectures and I say 'how does a normal Finnish mother react if you ask the mother, the teacher comes to the mother and says 'your child has a problem with aggressive behavior?’ So what's the normal response of the Finnish mother?’ And then she would probably say 'his father has even more problems with aggression.’ And this is a true story: I once told this (inaudible ) joke as an introduction to a cooperation with the parents, and I told them from Sweden and somebody in the audience lifted their arm and said 'that's not how a Swede would react to that situation.’ And I went like 'okay, so what would a Swedish mother say?’ 'So she says 'that's very interesting to hear because he didn't have any such problems with the previous teacher.’ 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON Okay, so instead of—so this whole problem talk, that at some level you're 'solving problems' but that's not part of the language or the, you know, what I would use, sort of the culture you're creating, this kind of sense of it's not so much a contract of 'here's a problem we're going to solve,’ so how do you present this to people if you're not talking about this? 

00:06:45
BEN FURMAN Okay, so then I think it was kind of a good invention—I'm sure it was not my invention, probably a lot of people have come up with the same idea—but children cooperate with us much better if we don't talk about problems but we talk about skills they need to learn, so then he goes like 'I've been thinking about you, Johnny. There's something I think you could learn so that you'll have a little bit more friends or so that you'd enjoy school more or that you'd be happier here amongst your friends,’ but children kind of accept the idea that they need to learn or develop or become better—usually, they say 'you need to perhaps become a little bit better at—‘ (inaudible ) controlling your emotions or it could be, you know, just initiating play with other kids, it could be, you know, being on time at school, it could be taking care of your, you know, schoolwork. It could be whatever the child needs to become better at, but it's kind of another way of thinking. You stop thinking about problems altogether and then you replace that thinking, talking about (inaudible ), and not only kids will collaborate with you like that when you do this, also suddenly parents, even those parents who are almost impossible to collaborate with, suddenly are like 'oh, this is such a lovely approach.’ It changes the whole atmosphere of the way we go about business, this simple, almost childish thing: stop talking about problems, only talk about what skills the child needs to learn. Very often, the parents need to learn these skills, too, but I mean you can decide where to start and usually it is easier to start with the child. 

00:08:35
RICH SIMON Okay, let's—we're going to get to—because you've codified this. You have a book where you talk about a range—you've really organized this—of what parents need to learn in order to apply this, whether they're working with a therapist or not with their own kids but, before we get into that, give us, tell me a story about a case and give me kind of a classic situation where there's a classic presenting problem with a child of whatever age you want to choose and how that might have been a more conventional approach to solving this problem and how you turn it into a opportunity to teach kids some new skills. 

00:09:20
BEN FURMAN Okay, here's a story from not so long ago: this kid is only six years old and his problem is he's in preschool still—in Finland, six years old is still preschool—so this one has the problem of what you would call 'dominating behavior,’ like always deciding what everybody needs to do and kind of telling everyone 'you have to do this, you have to do that' and being so dominant and so, what is it, forcing everybody to do things his way that the other kids get tired of him and then they don't do like he says, they start to protest, and then he hits them, so he has kind of a reputation of being—they They call him a 'king,’ he tries to be the 'king,’ the 'monarch’— 

00:10:10
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) without, he doesn't—yeah. What other— 

00:10:15
BEN FURMAN (inaudible ) diagnostic terms, you know, some people might even put a narcissistic label on a child like that, awful wording, and then I'm seeing the child together with mom and dad and then there's the third person, the teacher from the preschool and then I have only one question—I always only have one question, I only go like 'okay, so what does he need to learn?’ And then they tell me about the problem and so I always go like 'so what does he need to learn? What kind of skill would he need to develop?’ And people go and scratch their head, we scratch the head together, we all try to find what the skill could be that this guy might benefit from learning, and then we come up with the skill after a long discussion and he kind of argues it but he's interested. The six-year-old is interested in finding out what skill he needs to learn to become happier, obviously, and then the skills are kind of jumping and then the skill is to be able to say every now and then, maybe several times a day, to his friends 'now you can decide.’ That's all he needs to learn, to say 'no, you can decide.’ It's that easy. And since we're sitting together and there are some students, too—now, then we can practice immediately. That's the point: you have to start practicing immediately. So, then I said 'who's going to sit on this chair?' And the boy says 'Daddy decides.’ He goes ’Daddy decides!’ And Daddy spontaneously stands up, gives his child a hug, just to tell him how nice that you're already practicing your skill and then we try again and Mommy goes, he says 'Mommy decides,’ mom gives him a hug. Third time, the teacher gives him a hug. He gets three hugs just by saying three times 'Mommy decides, Daddy decides,’ and, you know, when they were leaving and I asked 'where are you going?’ And they said 'we're going to eat in a restaurant.’ I said 'okay, so which restaurant are you thinking of’—I had in my mind, you know, McDonald's or something—and then Daddy happens to say—it was not planned—Daddy says 'we haven't decided yet,’ so I just take a peek at the boy—we're sitting in a circle—and I didn't say anything! I just take a peek and he goes like 'Daddy decides!’ So he said 'Daddy decides,’ so he's like four times practiced his skills and ready next week back to preschool, back (inaudible ) started telling the other kids 'you can decide now' and that was his skill and when he learned his skill, he became more friendly and when he became more friendly, he got more friends, so he learned that it pays to learn a new skill. I don't know if you call that problem-solving. It is problem-solving, but it's problem-solving through learning skills and this applies not only to children, actually, but also applies to adults, too, who can always find a skill to learn. There was one boy, he was afraid of dogs, huh? Another problem, and this can be applied to any problem—almost any problem—so the mother said 'shall we do (inaudible ) with you?’ And the boy says 'yeah, I'd like to try it.’ 'Well, what problem do you want to solve with (inaudible )?’ So he says 'well, I'm afraid of dogs.’ Mom says 'yes, you are,’ so then mom says 'oh, sorry, I got it wrong. You're not supposed to solve problems with this method, you're supposed to learn skills, so what skill do you need to learn in order not to be afraid of dogs?’ The boy said “I need to let them come close to me and sniff me.’ 

00:14:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:14:00
BEN FURMAN This way of working fits the way children think. They are better at this than we are. We kind of have to learn this way of thinking; kids are natural, because once they have identified what it's clear they need to learn, the next day is 'how are you going to learn it? How can we make learning the skill fun for you?’ And part of the fun is having friends support you and make it like a sport, you know? It becomes like a sport activity with parties, celebration when you've learned— 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON Celebration—yeah, yeah. 

00:14:35
BEN FURMAN Applauding, whatever else. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay, so now, so these—I always like hearing you describe these cases because I feel, you know, warm and cuddly as you describe them. 

00:14:50
BEN FURMAN I do, too! 

00:14:50
RICH SIMON There are some cases, occasionally, where it's not a single skill and it's a more—and there may be multiple skills and so can you give us a flavor of something of how, of a process where it does become more complicated and what the process might be where there's a series of skills and you're beginning in the way you're describing and that's a first step in something that's a bit more complicated. 

00:15:25
BEN FURMAN Yes, and you know many children have many problems. They have concentration problems, they have impulse control problems, they have fears and they may have, you know, obsessions—they can have a lot of problems, maybe even toilet problems, eating problems, and it's very difficult that children have more than one problem but, you know, this skills thinking can be helpful because you're always talking one skill, so rather than having all this millions of problems and you kind of feel that you're overloaded with, it's simple like 'where should we start? What would be the first good skill to start with?’ And, you know, it doesn't have to be the most difficult one. There was one boy and he was soiling with his feces—among other problems—but he had this kind of. He was a big boy, I think he was eight years old or something, and he had this weird habit that not only was he pooping in his pants, but he was actually smearing feces on his clothes and on the furniture, so it was a really weird problem. It was impossible to talk with him about this problem. It was like a taboo problem for him, so then the therapist asks the parent 'what skill do you think he might benefit from learning?’ And the parents think and they say 'what we think he needs to learn, he needs to learn to voice his opinion. This boy, he never says anything, we don't know what he's thinking, and we think that's a very important skill for him to learn, like a psychological skill,’ being more outspoken, how would you say—anyway, the therapist goes to the kid and says 'I've spoken with your parents, I've asked them what they think you need to learn in order for you to become happier, and they said you would benefit from being a little bit more able to say what you want, what you like, what you talk like, you know, do you understand?’ And the boy goes, with tears in his eyes, and said that's exactly what he needs to learn. So, we have a deal—we always have to have a deal. The child has to accept the skill that we've proposed—even better when the child suggests the kid's skill by himself— 

00:17:35
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

00:17:40
BEN FURMAN Anyway, the boy did learn. They made a project, it ended with a celebration, he did learn to speak. Maybe he didn't become the best in the world, but he learned to say things so they could ask him questions and he would say his opinion. When he was done, the therapist asked the boy 'so, what's your next skill? What's the next thing that happens?’ He was asking for the next problem. He's eight years old and says 'I want to learn to (inaudible ) drive the bicycle,’ so he hadn't learned. Eight years old—it was a shameful thing to not be able to drive the bicycle. He learned to drive the bicycle in two weeks. His first easy experience, you know, he was so happy about this first thing, this thing that mother and father thought it was so important for him to learn, so now he got the hang of it. He wanted the children to get the hang of it. 'Now, you see, you can learn a skill. Isn't it lovely?’ And then he's like 'I want to learn to drive the bicycle,’ so he learns to drive the bicycle in two weeks, he has his [00;18:40]celebration, the therapist asks as the family's gathering together 'what's the next skill?’ And then the mom says 'you need to take care of your poop. You need to go to the toilet' and that was the first time you could speak with the boy about the problem, so, you know, you can make chains about this stuff. It's not one, it's not the biggest problem in the world, it's kind of a mini problem, but you build it up enough and the child's confidence grows to feel that they are part of this, that they can complain to the parents, or 'you had some good ideas, it's wonderful what you said, you can be proud of yourself,’ you know? You kind of create cooperation where the child and the parents and everybody's in the same boat and 'you're doing a great job’—then, it's possible to (inaudible ) the more difficult problems, maybe even violence or incest or whatever terrible problems there might be in the background, so the idea is not to jump and start to look at the worst problem immediately, but start with something soft so you create credibility and create good (inaudible ) alliance, eh? 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Okay, so now—I want to—because there's a whole way in which you help parents to incorporate this as a kind of parenting style. Before we get to that, let's just—I love these stories and can you give us an example—let's move ahead developmentally a bit. So, we're talking about how this sounds and how you operate if the kid is over 15, 16, even 17 years old, so these stories you tell are oh-so-adorable. As we know, 15, 16, 17 years old, they can be adorable, often they're not—what's involved there if you're working with teenagers in this model? 

00:20:35
BEN FURMAN You modify it a little bit. The same principles apply to adults and teenagers, as well, but you have to modify it a little bit and when you work with teenagers, it's very important that it's not like you telling the child what skill they need to learn. The smaller ones, you can just say 'mom and dad, they want you to learn to sleep in your own bed.’ But you know when the child's already 14, 15, something like that, it doesn't work like that. You can't go to children and say 'teacher and Mommy and Daddy have been talking about you and we have decided that you need to learn this.’ They will say 'oh, wonderful, I am so glad you tell me what I need to learn.’ That's not the way teenagers work, so you have to turn it around and what we have done—first of all, we called it differently. We actually gave it, the same process, another name. When we're working with teenagers, we call it 'Mission Possible,’ not— 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON Okay, good, good. 

00:21:30
BEN FURMAN Sort of like 'Mission Impossible—eh, we had to come up with something, but we couldn't call it 'Kid Skills' because— 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON No, no, no, that's a good place to start, yeah. 

00:21:35
BEN FURMAN It's called 'Mission Possible' and then there is a workbook for it—in Dutch, there's a workbook for it—but usually we don't want to have workbooks for teenagers because if you have pictures in the workbook, they will hate them, anyway. 'I don't like these pictures,’ no matter what—so then they have to make their own workbooks, but they use the similar steps and the first step with teenagers is the general family therapy idea that you always ask the kid what would make them happy, what they like to do, what things would they like to have in their life in order to be happier? You know, be popular or to do a sport that they love or to do better at school? It's 'what do you want?’ So you kind of start always with some idea of what the child or teenager's like and what they enjoy and what's like important to them and then it won't matter what it is, you built on that and basically you expand on that, so 'what do you need to learn in order to, for that to happen? So if you want to have a better relationship with your parents or you want to do better in school, why don't you talk about it? What might it be so that you'll become better at it? You know, to accomplish those things? Don't be afraid.’ Whatever the problem is and, you know, teenagers, I always recommend rather than focusing on the parents and many times they are so tired of these kids and they may have other kids, too, so then you could maybe focus more on their friends, like we often say 'family therapy' but I don't know with teenagers—do you really want to do family therapy? Of course you have to collaborate with the parents, but you might focus more on the parents, so then you say to the teenager, it's like 'who do you want to invite and talk about you and I'll do my best to help you, so who would you like to ask to join you?’ (inaudible ), girlfriend, two girlfriends, three girlfriends—you know, you decide, so always make sure that the teenager has a constant feeling that 'I'm deciding here.’ You are deciding almost everything. I'm just giving you good questions. I'm not coaching you, so in a way being a coach for the teenager is to help them figure out whether they need to concentrate or need to focus on what they need to learn and if they say 'my mom says I need to learn to be on time' or whatever, then you'd say 'well, do you agree with her? Is that something you want?’ It's very important that you check that the child (inaudible ) is something that the teenager actually wants to become better at, so those are some of the modifications that you need to do. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:20
BEN FURMAN And basically otherwise you can do it the same. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's go through—so you have, you have a program that you call 'Lessons in Solution-Focused Parenting and Child-Rearing' and some of it overlaps with what a lot of other parent educations might have, there's a bit of overlap, but it's really quite distinct. So, let's go—there are five different lessons that you talk about and let's go through each of them and if you could give us a flavor and particularly the part, the aspect of each of these lessons that's distinctive to the way you work in this 'Kid Skills' perspective, so let's start off with praise and encouragement. Now, that's where you start your book, so why is praise and encouragement so important and what is it that you want to teach parents about praise and encouragement that maybe they, most parents don't understand already? 

00:25:20
BEN FURMAN Yeah, and, Rich, you might want to know that over the years I've done a lot of, what is it called, parenting evenings—you know, when the school arranges like an evening for psychology where the doctor comes in and speaks and usually those evenings in here, in our country, they're quite boring, you know? Somebody's telling about theoretical stuff, how you're supposed to be a parent and you leave the evening and feel like a lousier parent than you did when you went to the evening. 'I don't want to go there anymore! I just feel bad,’ so I have done some parenting evenings and my idea has been 'let me take these ideas—‘ I cannot teach Kids Skills as such. It's a 15-step process, it's really meant for therapists and maybe some teachers—I would like to teach the principle. I would like you to get some of this, what we're doing. We love this work with kids and the kids love it and you have maybe seen some of it, but we want to give you (inaudible ) of it, so we cannot go directly to, you know, the process of 15 steps. Like someone has said to me, 'don't you have anything with a little bit less steps?’ So 15 seems like overwhelming, you know? 15 steps—but, anyway, then I start at these meetings, I've practiced, I've tried every different thing of 'what can I teach' and I've found that there are some things that I really do want to teach to parents and one thing is the one that (inaudible ) mentioned: I want parents to become better at praising their children, because praising children is probably the most effective way of changing a child's behavior. If a child behaves in a certain way that you don't like, then if you wait until they behave in the right way and you praise them, if you find a way to prepare to do that effectively, an effective way of praising the child, then it will be wonderful. I mean, it really works, so I'm always like telling parents—and not only parents—that maybe you can become a little bit better at this. Local parents already praise their children, maybe too much they praise, all the time praising them because they think that it will be helpful but it's not so easy. I was once playing tennis with my daughter and, you know, I'm like playing and she's kind of learning and she's hitting the ball and it's coming back and then we are taking a pause and drinking some Coke or something and I'm saying 'shall we play again?’ like I'm excited about her learning to play, so she goes like 'Daddy, I'm not going to play with you at all again if you're going to shout 'good!’ every time I hit the ball.’ 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON The American parent: we have to build our children's self-esteem with a non-stop patter of praise. 

00:28:20
BEN FURMAN Yes, but it doesn't work like that. I mean, we have to become a little bit more shrewd and they need the praise and it's effective, but we have to become a little bit more shrewd about it and I don't know if that's the right word—shrewd, like a little bit more clever. 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON So show us what you mean by that, tell us what you mean by that. 

00:28:40
BEN FURMAN Well, for example, many kids, particularly teenagers, if you start to praise them, they say 'Mommy, stop that, I hate it, don't be a psychologist,’ you know? Allergic—some kids are even allergic to it and some kids are like inflation, like you praise them all the time, so then it doesn't have any effect anymore, so some teaching patterns, varieties of praising, that's what solution-focused therapy does: a little bit more clever ways of praising kids. For example, I'm always teaching different ways of doing high-five or thumbs-up or shut your mouth, don't say anything because whatever you say, it's wrong. You can see from your child they're not responding to your praise, so try similarly and you can actually find patterns, something that you can agree on. There was one time they agreed a tap on the shoulder and then point at the child— you tap and point. That was their mutual agreement of how they would give the praise, so this is signal praise, but there are many other ways and another lovely one is one I call 'gossip praise.’ That's like when I don't tell to you that I love you or that you have done wonderful or that I am proud or whatnot, I actually go to a third person and I say it so that you can hear it, this kind of going through a third person is also another alternative and then, you know, teaching parents different ways of praising and one that comes from solution-focused therapy which is quite popular is 'don't praise, ask questions.’ Stop praising. Don't say things like 'very good' or 'wonderful.’ Stop it. Just say 'how did you do that? Tell me more about it. How did you (inaudible )? How did you feel about that?’ And analyze the success. I call it success analysis and we use it with adults, too. So, you know, there are a lot of different ways that we can become a little bit more shrewd about praising our children because we don't want to throw away that method just because we have become so poor at using it. 

00:30:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:30:55
BEN FURMAN And also any humorous ways of praising children and, you know, it's a long list and we want to give the parent the feeling that now they have more tools. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON Okay, so let's move on because we're about halfway through here and I want to make sure that we get to each of these installments here. 

00:31:10
BEN FURMAN All right. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON So the next issue—and this is often in a (inaudible ) to why parents are coming in with their kid or why a kid might materialize at a therapist's office—but it doesn't need to necessarily involve therapy—is called 'question of compliance,’ that 'my kid won't do anything I say or won't do anything that the teacher says.’ Of course, this is a huge issue and this fills the offices of child therapists and family therapists around the world, so talk to us about how to get kids to comply and what does the solution-focused framework teach us about that. 

00:31:45
BEN FURMAN Well, that's an interesting question because we need to get people to comply all the time—at the workplace, at the home, also our spouses. It's not only the kids that we need to get to comply, it's also our beloved ones that sometimes we need to change their behavior and so what we do is we do an exercise. We always do the exercise with the parents. You cannot—I really don't think you can teach this by preaching. 'Don't say this, (inaudible ), you shouldn't say it like that, you shouldn't say it like that.’ You always have them decide. The exercise is like you are two people and you are going to try to influence him and he's going to be the child, he's acting the role of the child and then they do it both ways and, first, it always starts with 'the windchime.’ We call it the windchime. It's five rules—takes a little time to explain, but maybe I can just give you a brief one. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON Oh, great. 

00:32:45
BEN FURMAN It's like scolding and then you're supposed to use words such as 'always, never, forever, you always do this and you never do that,’ and then you are supposed to say what the child is doing wrong and then 'whenever we go there, you're always starting to make a mess' or whatever, and then it's five different things that you do kind of a full-scale scolding and they get to do that. It also includes— 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON These are the negative rules. These are things for parents to avoid doing. 

00:33:20
BEN FURMAN Yes, but before I didn't say 'this is for you to avoid,’ I said 'you have to learn to become perfect in this form before you can move on to the other one.’ 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. I mean, the perfect dark side of parenting or something, right? I get it now. 

00:33:35
BEN FURMAN Yeah, it's like playful. It's the idea of 'let's—‘ 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Actually, before—uh-huh? 

00:33:35
BEN FURMAN Let's have some fun. Let's do some scolding, some really, truly scolding. 

00:33:40
RICH SIMON Ah, I get you, I get you. 

00:33:45
BEN FURMAN It's like you also go like 'don't you understand that when you are behaving like that, it's causing this problem and it's causing (inaudible ) and it's economic disaster in the world' and you— 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:33:55
BEN FURMAN Do kind of a—well, it's a parody. We do a parody of scolding and people have so much fun when they are doing it and then I always ask them 'was it difficult?’ And then they go like 'no, it wasn't! It was very easy!’ And I go 'have you been practicing before?’ So we're making a sort of (inaudible ) and realizing that that's what people do. It doesn't help (inaudible ), but you can become better at it and you can start to learn different ways, but first you have to become knowledgeable. You have to be cognisant. You have to become aware 'this is how we talk to our children. We don't really want to talk like this because it doesn't help.’ And how do they know that it doesn't help? Because they get to participate in the experience! So the idea is now you can feel how it feels. How did it feel for you? 'Oh, it felt like I'm not ever going to stop this behavior if I'd been talked to like that' and it's kind of understanding scolding and understanding threatening and understanding the way parents speak to kids often enough. It's very human, it's in our backbone so we don't have to think about it, and at first you go back and then you start to learn the other way and it's also (inaudible ) like a memory rule and then they get to try that other way of speaking—which is actually very similar to Kids Skills, with 'I would like you to learn' rather than 'I would like you to stop.’ You always talk about what you would like the child to do instead. That's an important detail. There are other details, too, because there are five fingers. One is always make contact with the child, like in therapy we always do contact before we give feedback to people, so you always go like 'come and sit in my lap' or 'let's talk after (inaudible ).’ Always make sure you have a good contact before you speak and then you present your wish or your demand or your request. You always present it in terms of what you want the child to do, not what you don't want the child to do. If possible, (inaudible ). We actually have tables where you can see 'I don't want the child to do this—okay, so what do you want the child to do instead?’ And you can kind of relearn that. It's a skill to learn, actually, and then you have to say something positive, too. You have to say something like 'I'm sure you can do it, I know you've already done it a few times.’ That's the solution-focused talk. We actually teach the solution-focused style of talking to parents so they can practice at home and they can practice with their kids and we always go 'wink wink, you can try it with your husband, too, or you can try it with your wife, too.’ It's the same principle, not only to kids but also to adults. 

00:36:35
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. Great! 

00:36:40
BEN FURMAN So that's number two. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Okay, so—and, just quickly, so you have these different—if you could just take it through, because I find this about requests and justifying and encourage, is it just—can you take us through the specifics of that positive? 

00:36:55
BEN FURMAN I'd love to, yeah, I'd love to. It's like the first step is making contact with your child—eye contact, teenagers are a bit different, small child, 'sit on my lap, I want to talk with you, I need to talk with you. Come, let's a have a chat’—then, the second step is making sure you tell the child what you want the child to do rather than what you don't want the child to do, so 'when you come home, I'd like you to do dun-dun-dun-dun,’ so you present something that the child can kind of see in his eyes, 'my mom or my dad or my teacher wants me to do this.’ If you tell the child 'I don't want you to do that,’ they get the wrong picture in their mind and it doesn't really work. The third finger is benefits finger, so you have to explain why you want the child to do this. You have to say 'you know, this is important for me and I think it would be also good for you. What do you think?’ And sort of start this little conversation of why this would be good. Maybe you have a (inaudible ) also say 'yeah, I think this would be good for you to do it like that like your mom says, like you should stop playing on the computer after one hour' or whatever the thing the parent wants the child to do, but it cannot be 'stop something,’ so no more 'stop playing the computer, stop whining.’ You cannot stop whining, you cannot stop playing the computer. You can do something else or change from one activity to another. 'Go and brush your teeth.’ Try and find what you want the child to do instead. The third, the fourth finger is, we call it the 'optimism finger' or 'faith finger' or 'confidence finger.’ You actually have to say something that (inaudible ). 'You are so clever' or 'you are so thoughtful.’ You have to say something positive. I'm saying 'you have to’—you don't have to do anything, but if you want it to have an effect, you have to say something that kind of gives the impression that you believe in your child and you can even say 'I know it's difficult for you but, you know, Mom, I will help you—Dad, (inaudible ) said he can help you. Whatever help you need, we can all help you make it happen,’ so you give this kind of an optimistic flavor to the whole conversation and the last step is then thanking the child, kind of making an agreement, so 'honey, what should we do? What can we do?’ Always give the child some choices because it'll make them more compliant if you give them choices—adults do, too—and so you can say 'so, honey, what do you think? What should we do?’ And then the last step—which is taken from Kids Skills, an application of Kids Skills—the last step is then 'okay, so if you forget sometimes, how do you want me to remind you?’ This is a very important step. Children promise to do things, then they don't do them and we get so annoyed that we could strangle them because they've already promised and then they don't do it and this is not good, this strangle feeling; it's not good for the child and it's not good for my heart condition, you know? Or blood pressure or whatever it happens to be. So, instead, you always go like 'so, honey, if you forget something, how do you want to be reminded?’ We see in children very often that if you ask them how they want to reminded, they'll be very clever and say 'Mommy, don't say anything' or 'Daddy, don't say anything.’ 'Okay, if you don't want me to say anything, how should I remind you? You can decide that. You can tell me how I should deal with it. Should I touch you somewhere or should I touch myself here or give you a signal? You decide how I will communicate to you that you have forgotten what you said that you want to learn to do so that we are amicable, we are amicable with each other, even when you happen to forget sometimes' because it's a good plan of helping children and accept our wishes in order to (inaudible ). 

00:40:58
RICH SIMON Okay, so this next step in this rubric of lessons, this kind of third set of general lessons, is sort of the systemic, the 'take the step back' lesson of just looking at not only your direct relationship with the child, but the other adults who figure into the interactions—and this is, I guess you would say, the Fuller(ph) systemic perspective here, if that's not too fancy for your down-to-earth way of looking at things, so talk about that. Talk about the way in which you try to engage and understand your coordination with other adults. 

00:41:30
BEN FURMAN Yeah, this is like—I would say that any parenting problem that omits this piece is naïve because not matter how good we are, found all the right words that comes out of our mouth when we talk, that our kids, we're all solution-focused here and there—nothing works if you don't have collaboration with the adults who are around the child, like the father and mother are fighting around the child all the time. Nothing works, no matter how good parents you are if the school—which is at least very common in our country—that the school and the family are kind of on fighting terms—okay, they are not fighting, but the school is thinking that it's the family's fault and the family's thinking that it's the school's fault. Everybody's kind of blaming each other. I don't know if you use the word 'blamestorming’—I like that word, 'blamestorming’— 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON I hadn't heard that word before. Store that one away. 

00:42:30
BEN FURMAN Yeah, it's like instead of brainstorming, you are blamestorming and that's very typical when children have problems. It's very difficult to avoid. I mean, that's the way we humans are. 

00:42:35
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:42:40
BEN FURMAN So people tend to blame—you know, father tends to see the world in such a view that it's like mother's fault and mother tends to see and the school tends to see things like it's the family's fault and the family tends to see—everybody tends to see problems like it's somebody else's fault and that causes—well, it's very difficult to solve problems, so I think that it is the therapist's job to create collaboration and you have to do something to get people to collaborate and we want to teach that same brain cycle to parents, that you can do some things to collaborate with your schmuck of a husband, you know? He doesn't understand anything, but you can become better at cooperating with him and the mother-in-law who is there all the time telling 'oh, you should be doing—you're doing everything wrong' and 'you shouldn't do it like that' and you feel like 'I don't want to talk with her anymore’—you become better with cooperating with her, too, so we're doing exercises, we're teaching people the idea—because the idea is what you want to teach—that you can become better at cooperating, even if it's with difficult people. This is very important for teachers to learn. That's why this program is not only for parents because teachers can become better at creating a collaboration with even difficult parents. That's what I have to do when I work in psychiatry—you know how schizophrenic patients—you have to work with these parents and you have to be able to say a compliment to them or you have to be able to ask them some questions, make them feel important or something so that they become your collaborator and, later on, maybe they'll become your allies and these ideas we want to teach to parents, that you can become a little bit better and it's already difficult, but you can become a little bit better. Simply by talking about skills rather than problems, you're already a little bit better and now people want to collaborate with you a little bit more. Show a little bit of respect—talking about if the child has a problem, you can learn to talk about the problems in an actual way that is not automatically threatening somebody else but actually more like, what is it called, consulting your consultant—I think that's what Michael White called it—is like creating a dialogue where you are talking to a person and appreciate people and where you're actually asking what they think they have for this situation rather than, you know, maybe not always directly, but somehow alluding that you have to change. 

00:45:15
RICH SIMON So, there are a couple of ways you talk about about the consent goes a long way and transforming criticism into conversation. Talk about those two: particularly, what do those mean? 

00:45:30
BEN FURMAN (inaudible ) role-plays, we do role-plays. We do a role-play when—we have this one role-play where we have a three-headed monster and you are the parent and the three-headed monster is the other parent and that three-headed monster is kind of starting to criticize you, like full-blown criticism—actually, they learned how to criticize when they did the scolding exercise, the windchime, so they know and they get to do it like a collaborative thing and then the other one feels ’oh, no, the problem, it's all my fault, it's not my fault, why is everybody blaming me?’ And you get to kind of feel how awful it is to be (inaudible ) in this arrogant or one-up way and then we're actually doing exercises (inaudible ) where they change their style of talk to the other parent and kind of make him feel like 'okay, this is much better. Now I want to help you solve the problem!’ And also we are practicing some key ideas of how you can transform people who didn't take the training so that you can still become better and you can start to kind of listen. You're also supposed to listen with the solution-focused ear, so you say 'so, tell me, you seem to be worried about this. Tell me more about your worries. You probably have some ideas on what I might need to do about this, so tell me what are your thoughts about that?’ You can kind of—I call it proactive, it's proactive listening to criticism and if you do this, you have to try it and have some instructions and then you try it in a role-play and then you have to feel in your body 'this worked better, I like this much better. Next time I get this kind of somebody talking to me like that, I'm going to try to use these ideas to make that conversation’—what's the word for it. Disarm? Disarmament? Disarming? 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Disarming. 

00:47:40
BEN FURMAN Yeah, you're disarming your critic. That's the idea. 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON Ah, okay. 

00:47:40
BEN FURMAN And we need to teach parents because they get a lot of that from school, from the other parents, from mother-in-law and that's also an important skill, so otherwise you get so offended that you'll never want to speak to anybody again. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON So, the—just so people can track this—so, there's this fourth lesson and we've talked about this a lot already, but I think there's some elements that you might want to add to it, this whole idea of how do you help children overcome problems, problems and difficulties and you talked about skills that the child should learn and motivating the child and supporting the child. Is there something we haven't gotten to yet that's an important part of this process that you emphasize with parents? 

00:48:30
BEN FURMAN Yes, yes. There is one thing about this whole idea with (inaudible ) is that it's very much based on the idea that there is a skill for every problem, but that skill is not apparent. It's not really so easy to figure out what the skill might be. Everybody knows exactly what the problem is. 'I'm so annoyed because we have this problem' and usually people, they talk about the program and they tell you all the details, like 'just last Friday we had this problem again! I put it on video! Please, look at the video and see the child's behavior or problem!’ And you just go 'okay, so what do you need to do and what do you need to (inaudible ) and what do you need to learn?’ You have to identify that, but if I can give you one example, I thought it was kind of a sweet one, is like if the child is having nightmares and you are the parent and you're going like 'the doctor is saying that we have to deal with what he needs to learn. Why is he having nightmares? What can you learn when you have nightmares? Learn not to have nightmares! But you can't learn not to have nightmares,’ but then you have to figure out, and this is the interesting part, is you have to figure out what is the skill you need to learn? So I actually wrote a story about this and it's actually available at the Kids Skills website for free for everybody to read. It's a story for children and it's this little boy who's having nightmares. He goes to his grandmother and starts to cry and the grandmother says 'what, why are you crying?’ 'Oh, nightmares! My mom and dad, they promised to tell you that I have nightmares and I cannot sleep and—‘ So grandmother says 'my dear boy, there is no such thing as nightmares.’ 'What do you mean? I have nightmares! The tracks are following me and they're chasing me and—‘ 'No, no, no, no. There are nightmares. There are only goodmares. Every dream has a happy ending' says the grandma and she goes 'it's because you wake up in the middle of the dream. If you wake up in the middle of the dream, of course it's nightmare, it feels like a nightmare! Now, we have to figure out how will this dream end.’ And then you can actually think that 'hey, that's a skill that many people can benefit. If you have nightmares— and this not only applies to nightmares, it applies to all sorts of anxieties—but if you have nightmares, then your test is to figure out the happy ending and then play in your head a few times and then hope that you will see the happy ending when you go to sleep next time and then (inaudible ) you won't have anything anymore and, very typically, no nightmares. As you're able to figure out the happy ending, somehow the whole dream kind of loses its intensity because now it has a happy ending in the waking state and I thought I was so clever when I came up with this idea and then I read a book on child hypnosis and it has been used for—well, not centuries, but it's been used for decades, so it's an old idea. It's not my idea. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON ’How to turn Nightmares into Goodmares’—I like that one, and that's a good skill to work on in my own life. 

00:51:50
BEN FURMAN Yes! Many people can benefit. It works with worries, too. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:51:55
BEN FURMAN It's not only with the nightmares, but it's an illustration of the idea that for every problem, there is a skill. You just have to figure it out. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, and it's not immediately apparent. 

00:52:05
BEN FURMAN Exactly. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Often. Okay, so we have a bit more time and let's take us to this last chapter where we're upping the ante a bit, where a child's actions really are wrongful—where some harm has been done, perhaps there's some damage done—and you really, you're coming in and all of what we've been emphasizing here is this playful element and here, when there's something where there's some real damage, where there's a cruelty, where there's other consequences to a child's misbehavior, this is the challenge of how do you maintain this playful kind fo framework in helping kids deal with wrongful actions, so talk to us about that. 

00:52:50
BEN FURMAN Yeah, that's good because, you know, if you want to be a little bit more solution-focused with your kids and you want to have a playful and supportive and coaching kind of a style, then what happens if they steal or lie or they break something or they, you know, do bullying, something terrible! So how should you approach those situations if you wanted to keep the kind of constructive approach? What me and my colleagues have done, we have been inspired by this concept of restorative justice, it's called 'restorative justice’—I think that's the word you use in there— 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON That's right, that's right. Yeah. 

00:53:35
BEN FURMAN It's like the idea of 'hey, let's not focus on punishment. There must be another way.’ And the reason why I'm challenging punishing is very practical: it is my understanding that in many cases when we punish our children, you know, standard punishment, 'I'm going to take your phone away from you, you're not going to go past curfew, you're not going to see your friends, you're not going to watch radio, you're not going to do this, you're not going to have that,’ you're kind of taking liberties away from the child. That's a typical punishment because we don't punish out children anymore physically, so then we punish them by words, by scolding them, or we punish them by taking away liberties and in schools, you know, they send children out of the classroom. In some schools, they—I think it's called expelled, when they expel the child from the school and they're not allowed to come back to the school for two weeks or a month or something, and all of these techniques that are used all over the world, like bread and butter, they are very, very ineffective. And not only are they ineffective, the bigger problem is that they often cause a vicious circle—family therapy is very cognisant of a vicious circle, that your way of solving a problem may actually make it worse, so I'm very worried about the tactic in our societies. We punish kids a lot and they're used to it, almost like 'wait, where's my punishment? I'm expecting to be punished,’ and so we have been very interested in Finland in teaching teachers, schoolteachers, to do more restorative style of dealing with kids when they've done something wrong and we call it Steps of Responsibility. There's a website for Steps of Responsibility, there's a computer program for writing apology letters that helps you kind of design an apology letter that's not just 'sorry,’ but actually a real letter which has all the different steps. The Steps of Responsibility is a six step process and it has been used in many schools here in Finland, in Germany, in Sweden, in different countries because the website has been translated to several languages. Actually, the computer program which helps you to write sorry letters, it's called 'Sorry Letter,’ so that one is available in, I don't know, eight languages or something—you know, Dutch, maybe Spanish is not there, but a lot of languages and it's been almost like a mission for me. I want everybody to know that there is a different way of dealing with wrongdoings that children do. We don't necessarily need to punish. Not all people buy this idea. Some people have trouble with it. They go like 'what are you saying? Of course they need to be punished! If they're doing something wrong, we need to indicate to them that they have done something wrong!’ But what I'm saying is the opposite—I'm saying that when you punish them, they actually don't take responsibility for their action and they don't learn much and we want them to learn something, that when you make a mistake, you can learn. So the idea is you go like 'Johnny, what you have done is not acceptable, but I want to help you.’ 'Huh, what? I thought you would punish me?’ See, it's like the thoughts, that's what I'm saying: to talk. 'Yeah, I want to help you make it right' because when you do things like that, you kind of lose your reputation a little bit when you do things like that, like 'I can help you get this back,’ so you are coaching the child to get his esteem, his/her status, like a sociological term—you do criminal things, you lose your status in the society, your credibility loses percent, and then you meet another person who says 'I'll help you to get it back, I'll coach you how to make it right again' and then the kid says 'how can I make it right again?’ 'Okay, I'll tell you. It's not so complicated, but first you have to talk about what happened. Then, you have to understand why it was wrong, why you don't do things like that, why we have rules against it. Then, you have to apologize. You probably also have to make it up in some way’—that's typical restorative justice, that you don't only apologize but you actually do a good deed to make it up. You cannot decide what that good deed is, you have to go to the victim and ask the victim 'well, what do you say? How can he make this up? He's willing to, okay? But he doesn't know how. Can you suggest something?’ And the victim, typically, will say 'I don't know,’ but then you say 'think about it,’ so you can already see this way of working with them, what is it called, misdemeanors or crimes or wrongdoing, whatever, this way of working requires a little bit more work. It's easier to give a punishment, but it's not very effective and I'd like parents to know that there's at least such an alternative. I cannot stop them punishing their children if that's what they do, but at least they should know there is another way of doing it and I would like to teach all the teachers in the whole world that the Steps of Responsibility so that they can do what one of the—there was one headmaster or school director who retired in Finland and wrote a little book about her work as a headmaster at a school and she said that she has enjoyed her career immensely and one of the reasons that she has enjoyed working with teenagers so much is that she came across this method, this Steps of Responsibility and she has been using it ever since she found out about it. It's readily available and it's in English and Finnish and (inaudible ) free of charge on the internet. 

00:59:40
RICH SIMON Okay, so now here's the crucial issue, of course, with these things that's the most exasperating for most parents, which is what if the child does not admit to having done anything wrong? In the face of all your attempts to get them to take these Steps of Responsibility, this is where the temptation towards punishment is very strong. 

01:00:05
BEN FURMAN Yes, it's a good question but, you know, first—I mean, this could be a more complicated answer—but the first answer that we have to take into account is like 'why don't they admit, why children are so reluctant to admit that they've done something wrong?’ And I think one of the main reasons is that they are afraid of punishment. They're afraid that the school will punish them, their parents will punish them, somebody will punish them and being so much afraid of the punishment, they think—maybe not so clever, but that's the way they think—‘I better not admit this.’ But if they are exposed to Steps of Responsibility from before, they've tried it, maybe they've tried it with something that wasn't very serious so they kind of get to know the idea. They have spoken about it—in schools, teachers can talk with kids about 'what do we do when, you know, (inaudible ) and somebody does something that they're not supposed to do?’ So teach the kids skills. 'What's your suggestion? How should we deal with these things?’ And the kids would say 'punish, punish, punish, punish, punish!’ That's very typical that kids suggest punishment. 

01:01:10
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

01:01:10
BEN FURMAN Decapitation is like a favor to a kid and then you go 'well, where did they get that idea?’ You know, and then you say 'no, no, no, no, no, we cannot punish. That's what we've been doing for years and it hasn't been very helpful. We have to figure out something more clever and we need your help in this' and then you engage the children in a discussion about 'how shall we together—you, me, your parents, everybody—how shall we deal with these situations?’ Because we can never avoid them. We can become better and we can behave nicely and so on, surely we can become a better school or nicer family or whatever, but it will never happen that people cease to do wrongful things, so therefore it should be a good idea that we actually discuss these things in advance and (inaudible ) people to be better at admitting because they know what will happen, they will be coached in making it right again. 

01:02:10
RICH SIMON Okay, so—we're just about out of time here, so if there's a single—you've given us a whole, for many people, I would imagine, a different frame of reference for how do we approach a lot of the typical child-family issues in practice and, particularly, this thing of how we can help parents to deal with what often seem like these impossible dilemmas of dealing with kids today. So if there's one thing for a therapist to kind of shift more into this framework, if you had to kind of stand back for a moment and somebody this week wanted to put into practice all these whole range of ideas you've given us, just some final bit of advice you have for us? Something about a way of shifting our mental set or the way, our practices and our offices, what have you found in all your trainings that is particularly helpful? 

01:03:05
BEN FURMAN I like the idea very much. I think it's the name of (inaudible ) and Theresa Steiner's(ph) book, I think they wrote the book called 'Children Have Solutions.’ I love that title! I mean, this is a prejudice, but maybe it's a good prejudice to have. I mean, think that when you meet children or teenagers, they already come to you with a solution to their problem. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

01:03:30
BEN FURMAN They hesitate—of course they don't know it, they're reluctant to reveal it because they are coming there because somebody told them to come, so they have their attitude, but you might have a prejudice, almost like a (inaudible ) and 'I'll give you a post-hypnotic suggestion, you are hypnotized and when you wake up after a little while from hypnosis, you will believe that children have solutions!’ And then you go like 'I'm sure this kid has a solution to his problem, he only doesn't know it.’ 

01:04:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:04:00
BEN FURMAN It's like a fantasy. You fantasize that they have it, you can become (inaudible ) because it means that you treat kids with respect—even when they don't treat you with respect—you sit and you go 'I'm very interested in hearing' and it was like this one child—do I have one more minute? 

01:04:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:04:25
BEN FURMAN Okay, so this headmaster in Australia, he told me he was using Steps of Responsibility and he tells this kid who had been bullying another one, he says 'look, we have to now decide what shall we do with you if this happens again?’ And that sparked the process, you know, to talk about 'how shall we, what shall we do if this happens again?’ He says 'I'm not going to do it again.’ 'Yeah, yeah, I understand it's a promise, but in order to make this credible, we also have to agree: what shall we do if this happens again? What are you willing to do to promise?’ The other guy says 'I don't know.’ So the headmaster has the same kind of hypnotic, post-hypnotic suggestion. He says 'you can think about it, I'll be back in a sec.’ He goes away, lets the guy think about it, comes back after a while and says 'okay, have you thought about it?’ 'Yeah.’ 'So what did you decide?’ 'I promise that if I do any kind of bullying again, I will not only apologize from the kid that I had been bullying, I will also apologize from his parents.’ 

01:05:30
RICH SIMON Hmh. 

01:05:30
BEN FURMAN That's what he said. 

01:05:35
RICH SIMON Mm'hmm. 

01:05:35
BEN FURMAN And the headmaster went like 'okay, you really mean that?’ And he looks at the headmaster and says 'of course I mean it—and I already told you I'm never going to do it again!’ So he was determined that he would change his behavior and he was determined to the point that he himself was willing to make an agreement that if anything like that happened again, he would apologize from the parents and that's a big thing for a teenager to do and it's an example of the idea that children do have solutions. If we treat them with respect and we kind of—it's our prejudice that we believe that they don't have solutions—then they have them. 

01:06:15
RICH SIMON Okay. All right, so we are out of time here, so let me just say a few things to draw in the audience and make them aware of, first of all, there's a comment board. We really invite the conversation to continue. All of those of you that have listened to this and thoughts were triggers, things were learned, questions you had, connections you made, whatever it happens to be, please [01;06:45]go up there for your own sake, crystallize your learning, and also to share that with the rest of us, so there's that. Ben, in terms of following up on this talk and making people aware of resources and how they might have training opportunities with you or resource material, there's free resource material. If people want to continue to find out more about Kids Skills, where do they go?

BEN FURMAN The easiest way is to go to my website, www.benfurman.com. You'll find all the links there from my website and there's also another source that you might be interested in when you work with teenagers: it's called 'The Self-Helper,’ some computer programs to help kids, teenagers, with their problems.

RICH SIMON Fabulous. Thank you for that. So, I feel it's this—I don't know if I've had the experience of feeling more like I've actually been in the same room with you during this conversation. 

01:07:35
BEN FURMAN Yeah, yes. 

01:07:35
RICH SIMON Something about your face, something about the enthusiasm of this work, something about—there's just a quality of kindness about this whole framework that you've presented to us. It just really, it literally feels very heart-warming to me. Thank you so much for sharing your work with all of us. 

01:07:55
BEN FURMAN My pleasure. 

01:07:55
RICH SIMON And that's it for this afternoon, this evening, wherever you are on the planet. I hope to see you back again with one of our Networker webcasts, but for now that's it. Buh-bye.
