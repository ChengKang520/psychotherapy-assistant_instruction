BEN GARNETTE I only get depressed. I get ticked off(ph) for easy when I’m depressed. 

00:00:30
HANNAH COOPER I guess sort of really feels like is being angry everybody for no reason or they don’t understand why you are angry but you would really know why you are angry and it makes even more angry that they don’t understand. 

00:00:45
KATE WATTS I remember one time my mom was dragging me home from school and I just burst into tears and I had no clue what it was about. 

00:00:55
BEN NELSON There was time when I just felt like I just don’t wanna keep on going it is too much I just don’t want to deal with it anymore. 

00:01:05

THE DOCTOR IS IN 

00:01:25
JAMIE GUTH Hello I am Jamie Guth up until the early 1980's most people thought children just could not get depressed. Today we know that isn’t true, children can and do become clinically depressed in numbers that might surprise you. 

00:01:35
NARRATOR Depression affects million of children each year by the end of high school one out of every ten teenagers has attempted suicide. 

00:01:45
KATE WATTS I didn’t know why I was crying so much I didn’t know I was so sensitive and well everything affected me the way it did. 

00:01:55
BEN NELSON So I sort of felt more like almost like almost like I didn’t like anybody I just want to be by myself. I was unhappy, just there was just a bad feeling, I guess. 

00:02:10
HANNAH COOPER I had been doodling, my teacher would be upset that I was just doodling and not doing anything and it felt like it was more than a doodle, it was a way to escape. 

00:02:25
BEN GARNETTE (inaudible ) I mean I go off really easy so I end up. I mean I am not afraid to just go ahead and swing(ph) I mean it bother me (inaudible ) . 

00:02:35
 Does his mom notice you? 

00:02:40
BEN GARNETTE His mom notices yeah. 

00:02:40
NARRATOR Depression comes out in many ways, clinical depression goes beyond sadness. It's not having a bad day or coping with a major loss. Children suffering from depression simply cannot snap out of it. It's an illness that affects the whole person, the way one feels things and acts. Parents and teachers can identify its basic signs and symptoms if they know what to look far. Susan Dubuque son Nicholas(ph) suffered with depression for years before he was correctly diagnosed and treated. 

00:03:15
SUSAN DUBUQUE The main thing is look for change. Is there are change in the child’s eating behavior or change in their sleeping pattern, change in their mood, did they no longer enjoy doing the activities that they like to do. 

00:03:30
Depression: Know the Signs •Change in mood •Change in appetite/weight •Problems with sleep •Sadness/hopelessness •Withdrawal •Irritability/anger •Poor school performance •Lack of concentration •Low energy •Physical complaints •Drug or alcohol abuse •Thoughts of death or suicide 

00:03:30
NARRATOR So here is the list of symptoms. In addition to changes of mood appetite and sleep habits kids can feel sad or hopeless and withdraw from friends and activities. In contrast some children are increasingly irritable or agitated, they may miss school or perform poorly often concentration and energy goes away there can be unexplained physical compliments like headache and stomach aches drug or alcohol abuse and thoughts of death or suicide are serious warning signs of depression. If these symptoms continue, a doctor or qualified mental health professional should evaluate the child, any child who has even passing thoughts about suicide should be seen immediately. 

00:04:15
If Symptoms Continue Have the child evaluated by a doctor or mental health professional. 

00:04:20
SUSAN DUBUQUE One of the reasons that depression is so often misunderstood and missed in children is that not all depressed children look alike. 

00:04:30
NARRATOR Susan wrote a book, A Parent Survival Guide to Childhood Depression about her family struggle and another book with her son titled Kid Power Tactics for Dealing with Depression 

00:04:40
SUSAN DUBUQUE The first word that comes to mind is typically sadness and in some cases children may not appear sad instead they may appear angry. So the two faces of depression that we talked about in the children’s book and the parent's book or the total which is a child who is withdrawn and quiet and like a little turtle pulled inside and then secondly the dragon and this a child who may be angry or non-compliant, upset and in many cases dragons look like attention deficit disorder and often that’s why there’s a lot of confusion between ADHD and clinical depression. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:40
NARRATOR Children’s who have disorders of attention, learning, conduct or anxiety are at a higher risk for depression. Although Kate Watts is a talented musician and can spend hours with her music. She can also be restless and sad for no apparent reason. Kate was diagnosed with both attention deficit disorder and depression. 

00:06:00
KATE WATTS I was more worried than ever. I couldn't sleep my hands would shake. I…I’d play with my watch and bounce my legs up and down. I couldn’t pay attention in class and have trouble sleeping. 

00:06:15
DAVID FASSLER, MD Psychiatrist There are lot of kids who come in with a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder or conduct disorder, because they are not sitting still on class and then when you get to the root of what is actually going on it turns out you have a pretty depressed child. 

00:06:30
NARRATOR Dr. David Fassler is a psychiatrist who wrote the book Help Me I’m Sad recognizing, treating, and preventing childhood and adolescent depression 

00:06:40
DAVID FASSLER And if you effectively treat the depression, the symptoms that looked like attention deficit or conduct disorder go away and the…and the child can sit still and focus. At the same time, more than half of the kids who have depression also have signs and symptoms of a second problem like attention deficit or conduct disorder or in adolescent particularly substance abuse problems. That’s really problems for kids because the average episode of depression in a child if untreated less than 9 months which also happens to be about the length of a school year. So kids can really miss out on and off what they can fall behind in school, they can fall behind socially with their friends and it's very difficult for them to catch up, also I believe that if an episode of depression goes untreated that their child is more likely to experience future episodes of depression. 

00:07:35
NARRATOR Of course sadness is a normal natural response to stressful life situations, but if the sadness runs too deep or last too long or develops into other ongoing problems. It may be a sign that the child is clinically depressed. Hannah Cooper’s problem started after her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 

00:08:00
HANNAH COOPER Just staying in the car with my father and having him go breathing like… and I would just start screaming at him for no reason. I felt like I couldn’t control my behavior and I would go storming off to my room knowing that I haven’t behaved the way I should have been behaving about why couldn't they understand why I was this upset. 

00:08:25
MEGAN MCANDREW COOPER Hannah’s Mom I guess it seems counterintuitive that she would be angry as a person that would be what bothered her most and then I could see lot of the same school behavior that I had as a child. 

00:08:40
 Helen is coming up from Florida tomorrow. 

00:08:40
HANNAH COOPER Yes! 

00:08:45
 Uh… huh.. 

00:08:45
MEGAN MCANDREW COOPER And I knew all those things were happening, but I don’t think that I translated it into thinking that it was depression when she is a little funny because I have had depression most of my life. 

00:09:00
DAVID FASSLER We now believe that depression in kids both children and adolescence and in adults is caused by a combination or an interaction of biological and environmental factors. So it's very clear to us that depression runs in families. 

00:09:15
MEGAN MCANDREW COOPER I…I guess also as a parent it's as if you're have giving your child some inherited disorder that you don’t really wanna think about. So it…it took…it took a real getting knocked over the head until you know that…that really was something I could do about it before I recognized it. 

00:09:40
KATE WATTS Thank Him for our food. By His hands we all are fed. Give us Lord our daily bread Amen 

00:09:40
NARRATOR Kate Watts depression had a very different trigger. It seemed to fluctuate with the seasons. 

00:09:45
KATE WATTS I kept getting depressed on fall and winter and then gradually got…got better around spring and summer. I…I guess I was back in fourth grade that I started noticing it. 

00:10:00
JANET WATTS Kate’s Mom I mean it was just you know not seriously unable to function or anything of that sort which she would just be in a sad mood and it would be prolonged. It wasn’t just a day or two. It must be you actually got there early. 

00:10:15
 (inaudible ) 

00:10:16
NARRATOR Kate’s parents became more concerned when this happened year after year gradually getting worse. 

00:10:20
JANET WATTS Between middle school and high school, we noticed really there were three things and it was a lot of trouble focusing, concentrating and staying on task. And then the sleep problems were getting to be chronic. She was having trouble getting to sleep, stand asleep and then waking up early in the morning. And then just you know depressed mood so we were seeing all three of those things and they were more intense and they were in elementary school. 

00:10:50
NARRATOR Ben Garnette tells a different story. Although he struggled with anger for years, he still does not recognize it for what it is. A symptom of clinical depression. 

00:11:00
BEN GARNETTE I don’t need anybody help me with my anger I mean if I want to change I can change. I mean it’s just a a long process you know I’ll be trying to change and someone (inaudible ) me off and making me mad again and they want off again and just leaving. People don't understand what I am trying to say. 

00:11:25
LINDY GARNETTE Ben’s Mom You know I think that’s the one of the things that in for Ben is…is really hard is that because it…because when he is depressed he doesn't look typically depressed that he doesn’t listen what I call as a sympathy vote. You know sometimes if you have a kid who looks really sad who is kinda dragging around, people tend to be more sympathetic to that. If you have a kid who’s kinda got a chip on their shoulder and he is saying you're annoying me, get out of my face that doesn’t usually play quite as well and unfortunately when he is most depressed when he is almost sensitive to having people as he says in his face. He just doesn’t want to or isn’t able to deal with a lot of input at that point. 

00:12:05
BEN GARNETTE Mom give me that. 

00:12:10
NARRATOR Ben’s mom Lindy noticed something was wrong at a very young age. 

00:12:10
LINDY GARNETTE Even at 18 months 2 years didn’t have a lot of tolerance for frustration and…and didn’t see him as happy as most kids and you know I can remember sitting like in kids movies with him and noticing that all the kids were laughing and he wasn’t laughing. And by the time he was seven, he had actually made some suicidal comments, you know you will be better off if I had never been born. The world would be a better place if I weren’t here. I wish I weren't here, those kinds of things which at seven is pretty alarming. 

00:12:50
NARRATOR Fortunately Ben got help and he never attempted suicide, but his mom fears it is still a possibility. 

00:13:00
LINDY GARNETTE There haven’t been as many actual suicidal conversations, but what…what been as pretty articulate about saying is that suicide is always an option that…that in his mind that’s not some that it…it is something that always possible which is scary. 

00:13:20
NARRATOR Suicide among young children and teenagers is a bigger problem than most of us realize. 

00:13:25
DAVID FASSLER When we do surveys across the country of kids in high school, one child in four thinks about suicide each year and by the end of high school one child in tenth has made at least made one suicide attempt. Usually the parents don’t know about the school so we doesn’t know about it. 

00:13:45
NARRATOR Sometimes the anger associated with depression comes out as violent behavior that’s directed towards others. Steven Atkins is a clinical psychologist, who specializes in adolescent depression 

00:14:00
STEVEN C. ATKINS ,Psy.D Dartmouth Medical School I think anybody could think he is at risk. I spend a lot of times in schools trying to help people think systemically and what I mean by that is this not all your fault, child. May be it’s part biology you born with depression, but it also may mean there is something going on at home that can cause a child to become depressed, like a mom may be diagnosed with cancer or may be there is lot of alcoholism in the household. Anybody would be depressed living in scenarios like them and not only that but you can't really go to your parents and say would you stop acting that way so they go to schools and that anger, that agitation, that depression has to go somewhere and so they show up at school and they are mad and they are irritable and they are acting out and unfortunately some of these kids get targeted to be made fun of because they are very different because they are sad. They…they stand out you know they've got the depressive presentation or the oppositional presentation and they would become easy targets. 

00:15:00
BEN NELSON And I've heard things that you know it made me real mad. I remember I was out of school for one week or something because I had like strep…strep throat and pink eye about the same time and somewhat I came back somebody said yeah I heard your behind fox (inaudible ) sacrificing rats and I just laughed on their faces like what kind of idiots are you all. 

00:15:20
STEVEN C. ATKINS, PSY.D …and that builds, and that builds, and that builds and they feel really badly about themselves to the point where they finally get you know they may get to the point where it is like I’m having(ph) you know suicide is an option or they may go. I'm gonna take a few people out. You know and…and actually think about hurting other people. 

00:15:40
DAVID FASSLER Kids don't just one day bring the gun to school and start shooting people. All of these are kids who have shown signs and symptoms of significant emotional problems for many years and… as the society and certainly as school systems, we have to figure out how to get better at recognizing those signs and symptoms as early as possible. And getting those kids the help that they need and even by getting the help we are not going to prevent all incidents of violence in schools. But I think we can significantly reduce the risk and we can certainly help a lot of these kids. The…the very good news about child psychiatry in general is we can help almost all kids who we see. 

00:16:30
JANET WATTS It was very hard getting some of the people at school to understand and they were just you know there were huge differences, there were some absolutely wonderful administrators and teachers that Kate was very comfortable sharing what she was going through with. And they hung with her over the long term. There were a few other people who just didn't get it and that was so hard. 

00:16:55
DAVID FASSLER We were talking about a serious concerns life and death issues sometimes, but teachers…teachers who are trying to teach reading and to teach math and to teach writing or having to deal with everyday and in their classrooms and you know I mean…I mean some schools and to see here…here from teachers. Oh! my god this journal entry really has me afraid. It really has me sadden about what's going on at home for this kid. You know and they don't really know what to do with that because that's not teaching English. 

00:17:30
NARRATOR Steve Atkins is working with New Hampshire school systems to get community based therapist in the school. He is helping teachers learn how to identify problems and is using private and states funds to pay for treatment so that it can take place right in the school. 

00:17:45
STEVEN C. ATKINS, PSY.D Despite being in a school, reputation develops. I have kids just show up at the door and say can I just (inaudible ) you for a minute and talk about you know breaking up with their boyfriend or the girlfriend, felt like they’re being pressured to have sex. Feeling like they’re not doing really well or measuring up to what their parents want and that leads to kind of figuring out what might benefit this kid. You know does the school need to step in and kind of check and see if there is a specific learning disability or may be the family therapy is warranted or may be the kid would benefit from seeing one on one to talk about issues that are… that's…that's really bothering him. 

00:18:25
BEN NELSON You know they wanted me to go to a therapist and you know to help and try it work out some and talk about stuff and I was really…really against it. You know all the time because I just didn't why I felt like I could do it myself you know because back you know back away is a kind of got better. I felt like myself, so I just kind of perked up some. I can perk up myself when I really needed to but…and it turned out really I couldn't. 

00:18:55
DAVID FASSLER It's really somewhat different for…for each child, but I general it will include working with a child individually. So individual psychotherapy or counseling, working with the family because all families have been affected by the child's depression and…and in some cases things going on elsewhere in the family may have even caused the child's depression. And it may also include medication, but medication alone is never the appropriate treatment for a childhood or adolescent depression, it should only be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. 

00:19:30
ARDIS OLSON ,MD Dartmouth-Hitchcock Med. Ctr. Sometimes it’s simply providing extra support…providing extra activities in their life, people to meet with. Not every child ends up going in to counseling because they are ready to talk. For young children as a version of counseling cum play therapy where they actually work out their activities in play. Look here mommy’s ear yeah Oh! We look at mommy's ear now it's your turn you (inaudible ). 

00:20:00
NARRATOR Ardis Olsen says support of the family should be part of every treatment. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:10
ARDIS OLSON A parent whose child is depressed doesn't feel a successful parent. They are gonna feel it's some point their fault, so the support of family and friends, physical support just being there helping with these tasks, child care helping with the other sibling. 

00:20:20
Depression: Resources • Talk therapy • Support groups • Supportive adults 

00:20:25
NARRATOR Talk therapy, organize support groups and supportive adults like a trusted the teacher or clergy can help children learn better ways of handling problems. 

00:20:30
• Guidance counselor • Psychologist • Social worker 

00:20:35
NARRATOR Often schools provide a guidance counselors, psychologist or social worker that the child may feel comfortable talking to. But when these are not enough, medications can be very useful in managing depression. Anti-depressive medications act on chemical pathways of the brain related to mood. 

00:20:55
ARDIS OLSEN In the last ten years one of the biggest changes is this is that we really have started to get effective anti-depressants that do not have major side effects that are now progressively being studied in younger and younger children. 

00:21:05
DAVID FASSLER The medications are generally…generally well tolerated by kids. They don't have a whole lot of side effect and if they have side effects we can adjust the dosage or we can switch to a different medication. 

00:21:15
KATE WATTS And she said… she said Kate you don’t know how much it means to me to be able to leave the country and that with (inaudible ) 

00:21:25
NARRATOR Kate Watts’ dad remembers the time when they were trying to find the right combination of medications for her. 

00:21:30
ROBBY WATTS Kate's dad It takes two to three weeks for the doctor and the person who is having the bout of depression to know whether the medicine is gonna working or not and during that period of time if it is not working things can get worse. Sometimes the medicine makes it worse. And that happened on with two medications that she was taking in ninth grade. And then they finally found a medication that would work. 

00:22:00
KATE WATTS I just felt so much…so much calmer. I wasn't hyper…I was… I could sleep better. My hands and legs weren't jiggling as much as I used to play with my watch or my jewelry. I was more outgoing. I was more myself. 

00:22:15
NARRATOR Ben Nelson benefited from a combination of counseling and anti-depressants. Getting up in the morning is now a pleasure. 

00:22:25
BEN NELSON You know I’m not as down although I used to be, it’s pretty near. I don't really feel like I have to go and you know I don't really feel like I wanna wake up at the morning go jump out of window or something. It just I mean it really just helped a lot. 

00:22:35
JAMIE GUTH All the kids you met today, have battled bravely with their demons and are winning. Each one of them feels comfortable enough for the disease and treatment to talk about it openly, but that wasn't always the case. Early on Ben Nelson didn't want anyone to know. 

00:22:50
LAURA NELSON Ben's mom When he was first diagnosed and we first went on…on the medication. He specifically said I don't want you telling anybody because I think he was embarrassed and so I agreed and…and over the course of the next couple of months it was okay to tell my family and that with you know he felt comfortable with that and then I think as he felt better about himself then he… it was okay for him to talk with his friends about it. 

00:23:25
KATE WATTS It's not something I go on broadcasting…but the close friends that do know don't really think it's a big deal you know it's just something that has to be dealt with and it doesn't change their perceptive…perspective of me. 

00:23:40
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON A…a reduction in your appetite… 

00:23:40
NARRATOR As more and more people talk about mental illness, the stigma goes away. But it's more difficult in some cultures than others. 

00:23:50
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I know that when I was growing up it’s an unspoken rule that you know black folks don't go see a psychiatrist. You know your mom will say (inaudible ) within her four wall, you don't go and talk to… 

00:24:05
NARRATOR Stephanie Harrington is the director of community relations for the Chicago office of the National Mental Health Association where she speaks to teen groups about depression. 

00:24:15
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Director of Community Relations, NMHA-Chicago Culturally they've noticed in research and studies that there is a difference in how the illness exhibits itself in some cultures. For instance with African-Americans there tends to be more physical symptoms such as headaches that have no cause, digestive problems where nothing can be pinpointed, it's not an ulcer. It's not you know something that we ate just the stomach being (inaudible ). 

00:24:50
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Did you have something you wanted to say? 

00:24:50
NARRATOR Stephanie works hard to de-stigmatize depression by sharing her own experiences. 

00:24:55
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON At 15, I tried to take my life by swallowing a bowl of pills. I suffer from clinical depression and I take medication everyday. 

00:25:05
NARRATOR Depression can effect children from any culture, any socioeconomic group and at any age, even infancy. 

00:25:15
DAVID FASSLER Infants definitely can get depressed it's often a sign that there may be something else going on in the family. But infants can get withdrawn, they can become less responsive to adults. They can actually start to lose weight and often when we see those kinds of signs and symptoms and…and there is no apparent physical cause we…we wind up working with the whole family to try and figure out what's going on and…and to help the family, help…help the infant as well. 

00:25:45
JAMIE GUTH If you recognize the signs of depression in your self or someone else ask for help. Your doctor or guidance counselor or therapist can help figure out the problem and steer you to the right treatment. There is no reason to suffer so deeply, when there is good medical care available. 

00:26:05
SUSAN DUBUQUE I think it's really important for kids to understand that as many as three million children and adolescence in this country suffer from depression. It's very common and again it's very treatable. It's not something that you need to deal within silence and it's not something that ignoring will make go away. So seek treatment, get help take control and things can improve tremendously. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
KATE WATTS And we had a (inaudible ) first quarter and I’m on a role right now. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
KATE WATTS And (inaudible ) on Thursday and (inaudible ) band or we have concerts every season which is going very well yeah… 

00:27:05
NARRATOR Ben Nelson is also doing well. When he feels stress or anger coming on, he writes. 

00:27:10
BEN NELSON You know that's where it ends most of time as I write it down just can't put it on the paper and then put it on bed or whatever and that's where it stays. 

00:27:20
NARRATOR After Hannah Cooper started taking anti-depressants life got easier, even as her father grew more ill. 

00:27:30
HANNAH COOPER I don't think any kid should have to go through this at all but I think if they do, I think that it’s really important that they do something about it. There is no reason why should be unhappy, really isn't. You shouldn't be unhappy.
