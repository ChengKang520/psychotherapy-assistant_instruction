Influencing Skills: Strategies For Change ~Automatic Thoughts~ Carlos Zalaquett, Ph.D., Lic. Nelida Zamora, M.A. Clinical Mental Health Counseling 

00:00:00
Automatic thoughts can create feelings and cause behavior. Discovering negative automatic thoughts can help us replace them for more appropriate thoughts and affect change in our life. 

00:00:00
Informed consent is one of the most important elements in counseling. The counselor ensures the client understands and agrees with the goals, procedures, benefits, and risks of the counseling process. 

00:01:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Nelida, nice meeting you. 

00:01:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Nice meeting you. 

00:01:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Thank you for coming. I truly appreciate you filling all our, uh, forms about the rights and responsibilities of the client. 

00:01:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Sure. 

00:01:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We do that to make sure that you understand that you understand what the process requires, and demands, and all the different things that we could expect, and the things that I'm, by regulations, demanded to accomplish, um, with this type of work. Um, do you mind if I call you, uh, Nely? 

00:01:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Not at all, its fine. 

00:01:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Nelly, let me ask you this, uh, do you have any questions, any, any, uh, concerns about the paperwork or any issues about, uh, working in counseling with me today? 

00:02:00
Confidentiality is essential to earn clients' trust. Note how important this is for Nely. 

00:02:00
NELIDA ZAMORA I just wanna make sure that everything's gonna remain confidential. 

00:02:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good question. Uh, and we certainly, um, do everything we can to secure your confidentiality, although, I hope you, uh, understand, as we described in our paperwork, that if there are reasons for me to, um, violate confidentiality for the sake of your own safety and integrity, or somebody else's, I will have to do. Those are typically situations that involve risk of suicide, or killing or harming yourself in a sense, or others, or abuse of child, elderly, or a physically challenged person, for example. Um, any other questions? 

00:02:40
NELIDA ZAMORA No, thank you. 

00:02:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT This is an interesting situation because, of course, you were referred to me by a different counselor, and I, I understand that you had been working with this person in a, in a, sort of different type of issues, and, um, you wanna work with me on a specific concern? 

00:03:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Yes. 

00:03:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Very good. What, what is that concern? What are you concerned about? What's going on that brought you here? 

00:03:10
NELIDA ZAMORA I've been feeling some anxiety with my new job. I just recently graduated so, everyday I'm feeling insecure about going to see clients, 'cuz I'm in counseling also. Um, and, I just, I feel nervous all the time and I'm losing sleep over it. 

00:03:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see, I see. And, and, let me see if I can understand this correctly; is your concern about, uh, working with clients because you are a little bit hesitant about what the clients can do or because you feel that you may not be as confident with them, what, what's the. 

00:03:45
NELIDA ZAMORA That's exactly it. I feel that I'm always second guessing myself, am I doing the right thing, is this what's best for them, um, you know, I just graduated maybe I need more training. So, um I just have all these insecurities that I'm trying to deal with every day and it's becoming increasingly difficult. 

00:04:05
Note client's response when counselor uses reflection & questions 

00:04:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I hear you, I hear you. So share with me, uh, some examples, some specific situations in which, um, you felt that way. 

00:04:10
Focus on main theme or issue 

00:04:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Before I see a client I always feel. 

00:04:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Any client? 

00:04:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Not specifically, I just started so there's not one client in specific. But before I see any client I always find myself, you know, just second guessing myself in terms of treatment planning, and, um counseling techniques, things like that. 

00:04:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, you are, uh, uh, ready to see a client, and as you are, um, entering to that situation, you know, you feel anxious about how will you, um, do, how will you perform, how proficient you will be. 

00:04:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Am I good enough. 

00:04:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How good, how confident, I see, I see. Now, I probably understand because, uh, the therapy you were engaged before, I mean you are still engaged, but the therapy that you have been doing deals with a different type of approach, and my colleague probably referred you to, uh, me because I'm gonna focus on, what we call, cognitive behavior or therapy, also known as cognitive therapy. 

00:05:20
Counselor uses information/psychoeducation 

00:05:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:05:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We believe, in cognitive therapy, that you usually tend to describe your uh, uh, side, or, uh, your, uh, mood, you know, to the situation. 'Cuz I'm gonna see a client and therefore, I feel anxious, I feel, uh, like, uh, hesitant, you know. However, what we have learned over time is that it's not the situation, the one that leads to the reaction or response, there is something in between, and those are your thoughts or images. So in a situation like yours where you can see, is that you are going, uh, into an event, and there is something that even triggers in terms of your thinking or your images that leads to you feeling anxious. And I think that I understand, uh, what is that in between, the question is do you understand? What happens between the situation and the emotional response? 

00:06:25
NELIDA ZAMORA I haven't really thought about it, because I just, I feel so overwhelmed with emotions that I can't really put things into perspective. 

00:06:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So let me help you look into that. So we're gonna engage in a (inaudible ) discover. 

00:06:41
Counselor helps client learn the basics of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 

00:06:41
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:06:41
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We're gonna work together to figure it out, what is in between. Think about this, what's the first thing that happens when you picture in your mind that you are going to see a client? 

00:06:50
Counselor used imagery to help client gain a different understanding of her issue 

00:06:50
NELIDA ZAMORA I just get nervous. 

00:06:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You get, exactly. It excites an automatic, uh, uh, connection. It's hard to figure it out, what else could be there? 

00:07:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. 

00:07:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But let me ask you then to stop for a second, you know, and notice that when I ask you, when you are at the brink of seeing a client, you know, let me ask you, what cross your mind? 

00:07:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Am, am I gonna use the appropriate counseling technique for this client. 

00:07:25
Use of paraphrasing & encouragers to further clients identification of automatic thoughts 

00:07:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Am I gonna use the appropriate counseling technique, very good. What else? 

00:07:30
NELIDA ZAMORA It's, like I said it's just so many things go through my mind it's hard to pinpoint a couple. 

00:07:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Which is fine, share some of them with me. 

00:07:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. Well, definitely am I going to be using the appropriate counseling technique, um, and, basically that, that's, um, that's a major one. 

00:07:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm., and what do we call those things that go through your mind? 

00:07:55
Identification of Negative Thoughts 

00:08:00
NELIDA ZAMORA It's negative thinking. 

00:08:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Negative thinking, which is interesting 'cuz we really call them that way, negative thoughts, or negative thinking. And, and the reason probably, you call it negative thinking is because you see that they are negative in nature. We call them, actually, dysfunctional, because sometimes a good, or apparently good, thought may lead to the wrong emotion. But, um, we're gonna stay with negative thinking for the time being. 

00:08:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:08:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, so the sequence in our perspective, is that you are facing an event, something go through your mind, you know, and that is really what explains your reaction, your emotional reaction. 

00:08:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:08:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Are you with me? 

00:08:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah. I'm just, right now as you're speaking I'm thinking about other things that go through my mind before I get ready to see a client. Even just talking about it now it makes me feel a little tense. 

00:08:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And it's interesting because, um, I was, I was at the brink of asking you that. Now that we understand this, let's go back to the original situation and see if you can discover some other things that may go through your mind. And so let's, let's, we are working collaboratively here, very good. So, uh, uh, educate me, you know, help me learn what else goes through your mind as you're facing those types of situations. 

00:09:15
Notice counselor's frequent use of encouragers 

00:09:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Is the client gonna wanna come back, just, you know, am I good enough for that client, or all clients in general, you know, am I gonna be successful, am I gonna make it, you know, am I gonna, is, is this really gonna be a future for me, those types of things. 

00:09:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And it's interesting because as you describe these additional thoughts, we also believe there are what we call negative thoughts, but there are also what we call core belief. It, it's not easy to find what the core belief are because they are suppose to be very deep and very central to whatever you do. But by looking at your thoughts and by trying to focus on what may have happened in the past in other situations, we may be able to pin point, not only your (inaudible ) but also the ones that represent core belief. And core beliefs are very central because those should be the ultimate focus of our attention, but for the time being we can also focus on your negative thoughts, so two steps process. War with the negative thoughts and as we do that we discover the core belief and we will work with those too over time. 

00:10:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:10:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But let's go back then to, to your situation 'cuz I understand you, you, you wanted to be able to do something about this, okay? And let me ask, stop for a second by the way 'cuz I can see your understanding this very well, to show you something we used to analyze different situation from a CBT point of view, okay? 

00:10:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:10:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I have a chart that I share with my clients right here. As you can see, you know, it's a chart that, um, happens to have four columns, but the first one's really the date. And what we, what we usually do is focus on a particular event, we look at the emotional reaction or mood, and then we spend time identifying the thought or image that may be involved in the situation. 

00:11:15
Counselor introduces a CBT chart to record automatic thoughts 

00:11:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:11:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, um, what we just did, you know, actually followed this three column sequence, so let's look at it from that point of view. Um, I'm gonna lower this a little big, can you see it well? 

00:11:30
NELIDA ZAMORA That's good. 

00:11:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And so, um, let's think about a situation right now, uh, that you are engaged in. You are going to see a client, okay, and you're feeling anxious, on a scale of 0 to 100, how anxious would you say you feel? 

00:11:50
NELIDA ZAMORA I really do feel like it's 100, sometimes. 

00:11:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT It is 100. Very good. Alright. I understand that there, there is, of course an interesting part of this which is, you know, every, uh, new professional will, will experience some hesitation and some anxiety. Because this is uncharted territory, now you are going to, uh, do what you have been trained to and all that. 

00:12:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. 

00:12:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So there is a, a clear sense of, um, that this is something that, that is expected, to an extent. The reason that you were referred to me is because the consequences of that, you know, are, um, kinda, a little bit on the negative side. Meaning you're losing your sleep, you're losing your, your appetite, you're anxious, and so the idea is to help you to manage all that, uh, to be able to be successful. But notice at the end of the day you won't have a serial. 

00:12:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. 

00:12:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT In terms of the emotions, uh, that every new client will bring for a while until proficient, and, and, and, confirm your proficiency if that's the case. Make sense? 

00:13:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah. 

00:13:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, and we'll also talk about the specific thoughts and you brought several of them. Like, I'm not sure if I'm gonna be proficient, I'm not sure if I'm gonna do well, I'm not sure if the client would like to come back, or the client won't see me successful. Very good. 

00:13:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:13:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So now we have identified, I'm gonna put this down for a second, we have identified specific thoughts, negative thoughts, that are creating anxiety in relationship to that. So the situation, the thoughts, and then the emotional reaction. Let's focus in on the thoughts 'cuz they seem to be central. In our view, it's not the situation itself, the one that upsets you, it's what you think, or how you perceive the situation what affects you. That's the reason why we focus on the thought. Um, so, what anything else that you have that suggests that you're not gonna do it well? 

00:14:00
NELIDA ZAMORA None, really. 

00:14:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:14:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Not yet anyway. 

00:14:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Think about past experiences, how many times have you, have been very, um, at the lack of a better word, incompetent? 

00:14:15
Counselor challenges incompetence belief 

00:14:20
NELIDA ZAMORA I don't think I've ever been incompetent, I always try my best. 

00:14:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. So let me ask you the opposite then, what evidence do you have that suggests that you may be competent? 

00:14:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Well, you know, my work throughout practicum and internship, I completed all my courses successfully, I graduated. So that must mean that I, that I've received appropriate training and that I should be competent to perform this, you know, these new skills that I've been given. 

00:14:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How, how, help, help me understand this, um, so you, you, you don't think that you may be very, very confident, but on the other hand, if I hear you correctly, uh, you have a sense of, uh, uh, having been competent in other situations. 

00:15:10
Counselor uses gentle confrontation 

00:15:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Yes. 

00:15:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT H, h, uh, how do you do that? 

00:15:15
NELIDA ZAMORA How am I competent? 

00:15:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, how do you know that you're incompetent? 

00:15:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Well, like I said, probably my graduate course work, that's, to me is evidence that I've been competent. 

00:15:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, I see, I see, so, so you, you, you're able to, to actually, uh, have some help, some support for your sense of competency. 

00:15:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah. Mm-hmm.. 

00:15:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How fascinating. I'm sorry for the, the degration, but I was curious about how do you know that you, you have been competent in the past. 

00:15:45
NELIDA ZAMORA I know. 

00:15:45
Counselor continues helping the client challenge her negative belief 

00:15:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:15:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh, now let me as you a little bit of a different question, let's say that you see a client and you, you don't do your very, very best, what's the worst that can happen? 

00:15:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Maybe the client won't come back. 

00:15:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Maybe the client won't come back. Uh-huh, and how, how, how bad would that be? 

00:16:05
NELIDA ZAMORA I guess it wouldn't be terrible, would just give me a chance to maybe, you know, practice more, or work on my skills more, but I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world or anything. 

00:16:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT It won't be? 

00:16:15
NELIDA ZAMORA It wouldn't be the end of the world. 

00:16:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, it won't be the end of the world. I see, I see. Now sometimes when, when, when my clients say things like that I ask them, could that also be an opportunity to improve? 

00:16:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely, mmhmm. 

00:16:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, I see, I see. So, so let me as you this then, um, as we, as we review the thought that you're engaged in and, so what other, um, evidence do you have that suggests that you have the competence that's needed to do your work? 

00:16:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Well, the few clients that I've seen have always come back, and they look forward to scheduling appointments with me, and seeing me again. So, I guess, that's good news, I must be doing something right. 

00:17:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh, yeah, that is, actually that is good news. Um, what is that telling you? What are those good news, uh, saying to you? 

00:17:20
NELIDA ZAMORA That so far I'm doing well. 

00:17:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. You know, I, I, I always wonder when people say to me, um, I, I'm doing well, because doing well for me may have a different meaning than it does for you. So when you say, um, doing well, you know, um, and you indicated the clients were coming back, what, what helps you to do well? 

00:17:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Um, well, I guess being confident in the techniques that I use with my clients, that was, when you asked me before, that was the first one that came to mind, am I using the appropriate counseling techniques, and you know, are they gonna wanna come back and see me, and it seems like I have been using the appropriate ones, and that they've been working well with the client because they wanna come back and continue to work on their issues with me. 

00:18:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. Hmm. Um, how interesting because, let, now I think of a different situation, if you were to, to bring some of the good things you did with those clients to new situations, what, what, what, what would you do then with your new clients that you have done okay in the past? 

00:18:40
NELIDA ZAMORA With my new clients? 

00:18:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. 

00:18:40
NELIDA ZAMORA The same thing that I've been doing, I always read their background information, I work very closely with their care managers, and I always get information from them, um, just anything that can help guide me in the right direction to take in terms of counseling techniques, and treatment planning, I guess just being prepared for seeing the client. 

00:19:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Being prepared? 

00:19:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. Yeah. 

00:19:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see, I see. Hmm. And I get the sense that you, you have done that very well. 

00:19:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Seems like it, so far. 

00:19:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, okay. Well, I, I will like that part. Um, so let me go back to our initial situation. We, uh, we're talking about seeing new clients, you know, and the fact that you were feeling anxious about it, and we made a connection that sometimes we may have, um, a relationship with your thoughts but the level of, sort of, rating of that emotion was 100. If you were to think about seeing a client, a new client, right now, what would go through your mind as a way to prepare to do that? 

00:20:05
NELIDA ZAMORA I definitely have more confidence, and I think that would help ease the anxiety. It wouldn't be 100 anymore, it would probably be somewhere around maybe 50, half of that. 

00:20:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see, very good, very good. And how do you accomplish that 50? 

00:20:25
NELIDA ZAMORA By thinking about the positive things that I'm doing, and how they, how I've been successful so far. So there's no reason for me to think that I'm gonna fail. 

00:20:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good. So let's recap, in the past when you are at the brink of seeing a new client you felt anxious, the anxiety was about not doing it well, not having the client returning, not having all the competencies to do your best work, and that we define as the real trigger of emotion. Now I see when you look into a situation, like seeing a new client, you can have what kind of resources and new thoughts? 

00:21:10
NELIDA ZAMORA More positive ones. 

00:21:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. Like? 

00:21:15
NELIDA ZAMORA That I should be more confident in the work that I'm doing, that even if a client doesn't wanna come back and see me it's not the end of the world, that'll give me a chance to improve. 

00:21:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. So now we are, are looking at different thoughts, and of course I will always suggest to my clients, not to use words like, always, should have, or forever 'cuz, you know, life is challenging, and you will have to navigate those challenges. But what I gather was that now you're feeling, it's not 100%, you said 50 or about. 

00:21:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:21:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good. As you can see we have used this session, not only to begin to address your situation but also to educate you about the CBT perspective. What I would like to do, if you, uh, would agree to this, is to use this very same chart. I'm gonna give you this copy and I'd appreciate if you can work with this copy and actually monitor, we call this automatic thought recording. Monitor what happens in different situations when you are at the brink of seeing a client, or when you are going to see a client. So that will be the event, and then we will see how do you feel emotionally about it, and rate it that one from, and rate that one from 0 to 100, and then I'm gonna ask you also to spend some time paying attention to what thoughts cross your mind in that situation, okay? 

00:22:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:22:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I have a date here because I'm gonna ask you to do this throughout the week. 

00:23:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:23:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And that will give us a chance to continue working with this. 

00:23:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

00:23:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT To identify, more deeply, the potential negative thoughts, to use those as a foundation to look for core beliefs, and I will explain more, that more in, uh, in extends, uh, later, but it will give us a way to work using a model similar to the model we used in the session. 

00:23:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:23:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Any, any questions? Any, uh, comments about that particular homework? 

00:23:30
NELIDA ZAMORA No, seems simple enough. 

00:23:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Looks like something that that you could do? 

00:23:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely. I think it would be really helpful. 

00:23:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. One last, uh, question, how did we do? How, how did it go? 

00:23:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Good. I feel better. 

00:23:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm., do you feel comfortable with this type of, uh, uh, therapeutic, uh, model or intervention? 

00:23:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm., definitely. 

00:23:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. Thank you. 

00:23:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

00:23:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I'll see you next week. 

00:23:55
NELIDA ZAMORA See you next week.

Follow-up Session A week later ... 

00:24:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Nely, welcome back. 

00:24:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

00:24:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Um, we, uh, have a, what I thought, was a good conversation and a good review of some of the basic elements of CBT, and we also work on a, uh, homework. 

00:24:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. Were you able to do the, uh, homework? 

00:24:20
NELIDA ZAMORA I was. 

00:24:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. How, how did it go? 

00:24:20
NELIDA ZAMORA It went well. It helped me put a lot of my emotions, that I was telling you about in the previous session, session that were so overwhelming, into perspective, and, um, just looking at it from a different view. 

00:24:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, and, I'm sorry, and what did you learn by doing that? 

00:24:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Um, it's not necessary to have so many self defeating thoughts with no evidence. Um, you know, when we went through everything, there's nothing in my past that has show me to be incompetent. So there's no reason why I should feel that way right now, and if a client doesn't come back for any reason, or if I don't do as well as I had originally anticipated, it's not the end of the world, that'll just give me a chance to improve. 

00:25:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Wonderful. Um, so were you able to, uh, um, report, um, sort of keep a record of the, the dysfunctional thought throughout the week? 

00:25:10
NELIDA ZAMORA (crosstalk) I was. I was, I actually brought it. 

00:25:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, wonderful. Let me, let me, um, let me see what, what you wrote, if you don't mind. 

00:25:15
NELIDA ZAMORA (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:25:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, I see, I see. This is, uh, very interesting because, uh, I can see here that you have descriptions, uh, of before meetings, but you also have a situation where, um, once you were at home ready to, to, uh, fall asleep, some of these negative thoughts came up again. 

00:25:40
NELIDA ZAMORA (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. They would be constant, just repetitive in my mind, so I lost sleep. 

00:25:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (crosstalk) At that time? 

00:25:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:25:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, and I can see that, that they reach about 100 so that's very interesting. Now, uh, on, on the other ones, it, it's right before meetings with your client and you, you feel anxious, and worried, and, and, ah, the, the one of the key elements is I won't be a good counselor. 

00:26:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm.. 

00:26:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see, I see. Now let's take that one for example, to, to, to begin with, and, uh, let me put this down. Great, great job. 

00:26:10
NELIDA ZAMORA (crosstalk) Sure. Thank you. 

00:26:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Um, walk me through that situation. So, how the situation begins, what goes through your mind, what is your reaction. 

00:26:20
NELIDA ZAMORA When I receive that thought that I'm not going to be a good counselor? 

00:26:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT (crosstalk) Yes, on this one, yes. 

00:26:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Um, what first comes to mind is just, that overwhelming feeling of nervousness, and the consequences of that anxiety and that nervousness. If I continue to feel this way then I'm not going to be able to help my client effectively because I don't feel well. So, that leads to my, my thought that I won't be a good counselor. 

00:26:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Which is interesting, 'cuz as you can see we start with one negative thought and then all of a sudden it comes to sort of a, a, a, a fork and it adds a new one. You know. If I continue to feel this way, so now it's not just the situation, but feeling about the situation and the ultimate outcome is, is a negative one. So let's take that one as an example of a situation we can work with. Okay. And see if we can make a, a change on that. 

00:27:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:27:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. Let's say that we're going back in time to that very same moment, you are at the brink of seeing your client, and then all of a sudden, you know, you catch yourself getting nervous, you are reaching, you know, a high level on the ratings scale. Probably 90 to 100, so it's very discomfort, very uncomfortable for you, a sense of discomfort, and now you're thinking, well if I feel this way, you know, I'm, I'm gonna be real bad. 

00:27:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. 

00:27:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. Notice that I called that the negative side of the cycle because, it's a situation, you, you, you start thinking about it, and then you feel worse. What, based on what we did last time, what do you think we can assume we could do in a situation like that one? Go back to the beginning, you are, uh, ready to see a person, you are feeling anxious, and you are now feeling anxious about feeling anxious. What can you do to change that situation? 

00:28:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Start thinking about the positive things instead of focusing so much on the negative. 

00:28:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT For example, what can you say in your mind that can quote unquote, contradict the negative thoughts? 

00:28:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Well, like we were talking about last session, that there's no evidence that really shows me to be incompetent in the past, so why would that necessarily happen now? Why would I all of a sudden be incapable of doing something or being successful at something? 

00:28:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good. What else can you say in your mind that may help you challenge those negative thoughts? 

00:29:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Well, just keep reminding myself that I am doing a good job with my clients because they do keep coming back, and they keep setting up appointments. So, that's definitely a positive thing. 

00:29:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh, very good, very good. And I can see that as you are now describing these you are smiling. It's, it's almost like you just made a change in the situation. Not, not, of course not on (inaudible ) but as we were thinking about it here. Wonderful, wonderful. As you can see, and, and we're gonna analyze the other situation, but I've noticed that you only had two, uh, during this week. H, h, how come that, uh, there were only two? 

00:29:35
NELIDA ZAMORA I, I think I've been feeling better since our last session. I've been able to, um, I guess deal with my emotions a little better, definitely positive thinking has, has come into play, and, um, I feel more confident in what I'm doing. 

00:29:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Is there a situation where you, you caught yourself going into a negative one and you were able to stop, and, and? 

00:29:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Oh, yeah. 

00:30:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Really? 

00:30:00
NNELIDA ZAMORA It's not like it doesn't happen. It happens, um, you know, those negative thoughts do take place at first, but I'm, you know, after discussing these techniques, I'm able to switch them and turn them into more positive ones. 

00:30:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Notice what you are doing, which is one of our key concepts, the three, the three Cs of (inaudible ) the three Cs, see. You are catching your thoughts, you are developing awareness of the negative thoughts, and then you are challenging them. Well, I don't have any reason to believe, I have evidence that says the opposite. Okay? And then you are changing them, meaning you are developing the idea that you do have the competence, and that is a wonderful future outcome. So before we adjourn today let me, um, say to you, two different things. One is, um, that we have many techniques. Like for example for negative thoughts we can use thought stopping and there are other CBT techniques, but also we can branch out our focus because when you work with clients ,you will work, for example, with the various clientele, and we will address issues like working with females, or working with other diverse populations, and how do you as a Latina feel working with them. Does that sound like a plan? 

00:31:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely. 

00:31:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Wonderful, wonderful. So that's what we're going to continue doing throughout this session and the next one. 

00:31:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Good. Thank you. 

00:31:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Great. Good job. 

00:31:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

00:31:25

MICROTRAINING 

00:31:25
The client has learned a new cognitive technique in the session. Using the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy model has helped the client identify her negative thoughts and ways to challenge and change these to live more effectively. 

00:31:25
Clients can learn to detect automatic thoughts by: Learning about the CBT conceptualization. Discovering negative automatic thoughts using thought recording charts. Finding ways to replace these for more appropriate thoughts. Applying these techniques in their everyday situations to affect positive changes in their lives. 

00:31:25
These demonstrations are for professional training and for use in skills, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped.

Gestalt Integration: Internal parts, polarities, and dichotomies produce stress and interfere with decision making. Establishing communication between these parts help clients integrate even unwanted parts of self and facilitate growth and progress. 

00:32:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Good to see you again Seriashia. Um, welcome back. 

00:32:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Thank you. Thank you. It's good to see you too. 

00:32:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We, um, decided last time that we wanted to focus on a particular aspect of your experience growing up. 

00:32:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:32:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, uh,, um, you wanted to see if there was a way to, uh, create an impact, affect positively that situation. 

00:33:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. 

00:33:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Please describe the situation again so we can start from there. 

00:33:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, um, I've just been having some issues lately with, um, being legally blind, and not being able to transport myself from place to place and sometimes it makes me feel a little bit inadequate and want to give up because it's really difficult, um, to try to do all of the things that I do, um, and I feel as if I'm a burden to other people. And, so, I just wanted some help with that because I've just been having some difficulty with those feelings and it's making me as if I want to just give up at times. 

00:33:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Just give up? 

00:33:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm.. 

00:33:40
Interview starts with strengths 

00:33:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now from what I've learned from you on the previous sessions is that you have been very successful at what you do. 

00:33:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:33:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You are a educated woman, you know, from a diverse background who can accomplish, or have accomplished, a number of different academic degrees and is at the brink of, of accomplishing another one. 

00:34:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:34:00
Counselor introduces Gestalt therapy 

00:34:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, as we spoke my impression is that, is like, there are like two different dimensions here, two different what Gestaltist therapists call parts. 

00:34:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:34:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay, and they are in some sort of a, of a, of a polarity type of position. 

00:34:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:34:20
Obtaining permission for new strategy 

00:34:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, being as it is, I will have to ask your permission to work with an experiential technique, a Gestalt based technique. Although modified, as you will see at the end, but, um, would you like to, to try a different technique today? 

00:34:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Sure. I, I definitely would like to try something. 

00:34:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. This is what I'm gonna ask you to do. 

00:34:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:34:40
Relaxation helps bring client to here and now 

00:34:40
Imagery Directive 

00:34:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I'm gonna ask you to take a deep breath in and out, very good, to relax your shoulders and your body, and I'm gonna ask you to, uh, put your hands on your lap in this way. Very good. Let your feet rest on the floor, comfortably, make sure your back is comfortable also, and now I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes, turn your hands upside down. Very good, and I'm gonna ask you to use your imagination to picture in one of those hands, an image of yourself, an image of Seriashia's concerned about her visual limitation. And whenever you picture this image of yourself, just take a moment to share with me how does she look like, what is her, her attitude, and what is your sense of her? 

00:35:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, she is crouched in a corner, and she is scared, and wants to give up, and she looks very tired. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:00
MICROTRAINING 

00:36:00
Next, Carlos introduces a dialogue of parts. We have already seen a strong capable woman who is also scared and tired. Note the use of hands. 

00:36:00
Guiding a dialogue of internal parts 

00:36:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very tired. Thank you very much. That was a very, very good representation and I could sense that I have like a, an understanding, to some extent, to what is going on. Now, uh, on your left hand there, you know, picture an image of yourself as a woman who has accomplished all these different academic achievements and other achievements in life. How does she look like, you know, what is your position in that image, and what's your sense about her? 

00:36:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, she is standing very tall, and she's got her arms crossed, and she is looking like she is very upset with the other part of myself, and, um, she is, definitely seems very distinguished, and just irritated. 

00:37:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Irritated? So, allow me to invite you to continue exploring this conversation by letting the person, the Seriashia on your left hand to look at the Seriashia on the right hand, and to let the Seriashia on the right hand to look at the one on the left hand. How do they feel about one another? What will they like to say to one another? And once you notice that, let one of them tell the other one how that you see her, how does she likes her, and what would she like for her to do? 

00:37:55
Here and now awareness of experience 

00:37:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, the Seriashia on this hand looks at this Seriashia and says that she would like her to get up and stop feeling sorry for herself, and she doesn't like it when she sits and feels sorry for herself because there are too many things to do, and there is no time for her to be feeling that way. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
MICROTRAINING 

00:38:20
In the following, note the flow between hands as Seria moves to a Gestalt integration. The Gestalt "empty chair" strategy could achieve the same objective. 

00:38:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, let's repeat that (inaudible ) in, in, in first person as if the Seriashia on that hand, you know, is verbally addressing the other one. I don't like the way you, I would like for you to, uh, using a first person communication and direct communication between these images. 

00:38:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I don't like the way you are sitting in the corner feeling sorry for yourself. There is no time for this. You need to get up and you need to get going because we have too many things to do and there is no time for you to feel sorry for yourself. 

00:39:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does the, the, the, the Seriashia on your right hand, you know, reacts to that? How does she feels and what you would like to say to respond to that? 

00:39:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I'm tired of you bullying me and I'm tired. I'm just tired of always having to ask everyone to do things for me and there's so many things I can't do for myself, and I wish that you would just leave me alone. 

00:39:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How does the other one react to that and what would you like to say in reply? 

00:39:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I can't leave you alone because if I leave you alone you will be left to do nothing, and you have a lot of support around you, and yes you can't do a lot of things yourself, but you're lucky enough to have other people to do them for you, and you need to get up because there is no time for this. 

00:40:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How would the other Seriashia respond to that? 

00:40:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Every once in a while I would like to feel sorry for myself and I would like some time to sit back and to be who I am, and I don't need you bullying me. 

00:40:10
Notice counselor's frequent use of encouragers 

00:40:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. Allow the dialog to continue. What would the other Seriashia respond to that? 

00:40:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That I understand that you need that time but the thing about it is, is that while you have people around, while you have the ability to get to and from where you need to go you need to take advantage of it, and you need to stop the wallowing. 

00:40:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:40:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And this Seriashia would say that I, I understand that and every once in a while though, I do feel that way when things get really difficult. But I do understand that I do need to get up and I do need to do what it is that I need to do, but sometimes it's just really hard and I need help. 

00:41:05
Note counselor's use of "I" as he tunes in with client experience 

00:41:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Let her repeat that last part sometimes it's really hard and I need help. Yes. 

00:41:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS (crosstalk) I need help, and I need help. 

00:41:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. What, what, what is the other Seriasha's reaction to that? 

00:41:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, I don't think that she's as angry anymore, but she would say that I understand that you need help and I can help you. That's what I'm trying to do. 

00:41:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now let me ask you to, uh, open your eyes for a second and, and, uh, look at your hands as if you were looking at them from your mind's eye, and, uh, what do you notice? What did you notice about this conversation so far? 

00:41:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I noticed that the two, the two parts of me seemed to be getting closer together. 

00:41:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh, very good. 

00:41:50
Client starts a Gestalt integration 

00:41:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And that, um, even though there are two different parts of me that, it just seems as if it's easier to handle things, but right now they're separated, but it would be easier to handle things if they were to support one another. 

00:42:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. And what do you think that keeps them separate? 

00:42:10
Good insight and awareness 

00:42:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Just the feeling of one feeling as if the other w, won't get it together and the other one feeling as if this Seriashia is just not allowing her the time to just be down every once in a while. And so I think that there is a difference in understanding, a difference in opinions. 

00:42:30
Top dog - Underdog 

00:42:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. In Gestalt terms we call this a top dog/underdog type of communication. 

00:42:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm.. 

00:42:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT There's a dominant part and a submissive part. Which, in reality they are both assets and resources of ourselves if we can get them to work together. 

00:42:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:42:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So help me, uh, accomplish some of that by, uh, intervening, mediating in this conversation. 

00:42:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:42:55
Move to emotions 

00:42:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And close your eyes again and notice that, so far, they have told one another things, feelings, what they see, and allow yourself now to engage in noticing how each one of them feel, with this relationship. And from that feeling allow either one to begin by saying I would appreciate, or I would like you to... 

00:43:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I would like you to take less time in the negative and take more time positively thinking about me, and to appreciate what it is that you have around you. 

00:43:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. What would the other Seriashia respond then, on the right hand? 

00:43:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I would like you to help me do that. 

00:43:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. Allow themselves to look at one another, okay? And what would they like to, sort of, really, really ask from one another? 

00:44:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS This one would say that I need your help to be a better person, and I need your help to be stronger, and this one would say that I would like to help you. 

00:44:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You would like to help? 

00:44:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm.. 

00:44:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. Very good. And I can see that your hands are getting closer to one another. 

00:44:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:44:20
Encouraging Gestalt integration 

00:44:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, let's complete this experience by allowing yourself to get your hands closer and closer to one another. Just, just observing what happened to each one of them as you get your hands closer and closer? And take your time to observe your images of getting together in one folded hand. And once you allow this experience to complete itself, allow your hands to go back to your chest, slowly, and embrace both of these Seriashiaa, and take a moment to, to, to feel, integrate, complete this experience. And once you have done that, take a deep breath in and out, open your eyes, and refocus here. Very good. How did it go? 

00:45:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Peaceful. 

00:45:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Sorry? 

00:45:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Peaceful. 

00:45:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Peaceful, very good. 

00:45:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. It feels as if there was a battle going on and now there is a consensus as to how things should go. 

00:45:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm.. 

00:46:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I don't feel as, I don't feel as in battle as I felt before I came. I just couldn't understand why I couldn't just be, and be happy with how things were, and... 

00:46:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT In, in Gestaltist terms the polarity, okay, has been transformed into parts. Both our strength and our weaknesses are important to us in a sense, when I ask people; would you like to be an elephant or a flea? 

00:46:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm.. 

00:46:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT People believe that the right answer is to choose one of them. In reality you wanna be both. They are both part of you. 

00:46:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:46:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And they are both Seriashia. They tend to pola, polarize from one another and to get into what is called an internal conflict of parts. 

00:46:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:46:55
All parts are potential resources 

00:46:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT As you get them to dialogue, they get to know each other, they share strengths and resources, and as embrace them those resources become available to you. In a sense there are moments in which you really need to ask for help, and that's great, and there are moments in which you can function by yourself autonomously and that's great too and all of that is you. 

00:47:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. It makes a lot of sense now. 

00:47:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good. Good work. 

00:47:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Thank you. 

00:47:30

00:47:30
MICROTRAINING. 

00:47:30
The client has developed new awareness about internal parts of her personality, owned them, and integrated them into a new whole. By achieving this the client is more complete, more at peace and more able to rely on her natural strengths to live a more fulfilling and successful life. 

00:47:30
Gestalt Integration: Internal parts, polarities, and dichotomies produce stress and interfere with decision making. Establishing communication between these parts help clients integrate even unwanted parts of self and facilitate growth and progress. 

00:47:30
Gestalt Integration: Internal Parts Dialogue is one of the Gestalt techniques used to integrate conflicting parts of the self and benefit from their combined strengths. 

00:47:30
MICROTRAINING 

00:47:30
These demonstrations are for professional training and for use in skills, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped. 

00:47:30
Psychoeducation: Training As Treatment Allen E. Ivey, EdD, ABPP Keith Kokseng 

00:47:30
Psychoeducation (training as treatment) is a vital therapeutic tool that can make a significant difference and improve likelihood of learning in the sessions to be taken home and actually used in real life. 

00:48:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh, this time we're not going to have a real situation. This will be a role play. I've asked Keith to play a mildly depressed client, and, uh, I'd like to go back to Colorado State University when I first, basically, got into this strategy and I found it incredibly effective. Basically, all it is is teaching clients communication skills in the here and now of the interview. I could not recommend it more highly. I was working with a depressed student. He said he had no friends. I taught him the skills of listening, he went back, he listened, he came back, it made a difference. We practiced some more, it made a difference. A year or so later, I was working in the VA hospital in North Hampton, Massachusetts. It'd become the standard mode of treatment. I was able to use video feedback with teaching of microskills, communication skills, and literally take a patient from the back ward and get him out of the hospital within a month. In other words, this is a system that works. At the same time it's simple, and obvious, so it's skipped over. But I'd like to demonstrate it in hopes that maybe you'll pick it up and use it sometimes. So thank you for being able to join me in this demonstration. You say you're going to role play a depressed client, so look like a depressed client.

Psychoeducation Demonstrations Starts In this example, Allen teaches attending and listening skills to mildly depressed client. These basics have proven enough to help those with mild depression and those hospitalized with severe depression. 

00:50:15
Demonstration of Psychoeducation 1. Involve the client 2. Teach the skill verbally 3. Role-play practice 4. Homework for generalization 

00:50:40
ALLEN IVEY So Keith, uh, we're back again. Uh, how have things been going with you? 

00:50:45
KEITH KOKSENG They been going okay. 

00:50:50
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:50:50
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:50:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh, what all happened last week? 

00:50:55
KEITH KOKSENG Really not too much. You know, it was kinda difficult for me to, I don't know, like get myself moving, going. Um, you know I, I felt like I had to trudge along through work and it, I was able to get through it but just, I just felt really, just not a lot of energy, and I don't know. 

00:51:20
Focus on positives 

00:51:20
ALLEN IVEY So at least we've made some progress. You're able to get to work. 

00:51:25
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:51:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. How has sleep been? 

00:51:25
KEITH KOKSENG It's weird. Um, I don't sleep really well, but I feel, I don't feel rested at all, and I'm just so tired and I wanna sleep but I, I can't really get myself to sleep as much as I want to. 

00:51:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. So, we're not going to do this today, but one of the things that can help with sleep is the meditation, relaxation, and breathing, and, uh, we talked about that the last time. But, uh, one thing I'm concerned about is, uh, what is, uh, how, how, what is the friend situation? How are things going, uh, uh? 

00:52:05
KEITH KOKSENG Well, you know, I have, I have, I don't know. It, I, sometimes I don't feel like they're really friends. I, It's hard for me to talk with people in general, but, you know, I, I'm able to have co-workers that I talk to kind of, but it's just more for like work related things. 

00:52:30
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. So, it, it, it's really at, at work is hard to talk and you sorta just do your job. 

00:52:35
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:52:35
The Client's Story 

00:52:35
ALLEN IVEY Get through the best you can, it's hard to talk to them. Uh, you tell me about one guy, that, uh, maybe the guy's that's easiest for you to talk to. Who is that? 

00:52:45
KEITH KOKSENG Well, it's Joe. Um, he's in the cubicle next to me. Yeah. He's pretty much easier for me to talk to because he's right next to me and, and we have to share information from time to time. But it's almost out of like necessity, why it's easier. 

00:53:05
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. What I'd like to do is do a little bit of stuff on what I call attending behavior, and, uh, I'd like to teach you a little bit about what we call communication skills. Now they can make a real difference if you're willing to take it out of this practice session we're gonna do now. 

00:53:25
KEITH KOKSENG Sure. 

00:53:25
Lack of eye contact common in depression 

00:53:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh, back to the office. Now, for example, right now you're looking down. I suspect that's what you do when you talk to him, is that right? 

00:53:35
KEITH KOKSENG Well, it's hard for me to look at people in the eyes, but yeah. 

00:53:40
ALLEN IVEY What do you think about when you're? 

00:53:40
Negative self-talk 

00:53:40
KEITH KOKSENG Almost like they're judging me, uh, uh, [00:53:45uhr, you know? It's like I might be doing something wrong so I'd rather not make that contact. 

00:53:40
ALLEN IVEY (crosstalk) So, so you're really thinking about, what are they thinking about. Um, so you're really not paying much attention to the person out there. 

00:53:55
KEITH KOKSENG No. 

00:53:55
ALLEN IVEY Okay. See Keith our goal for the day is to take the focus out of here and put it out there on the other person. Uh, for example, now look at me. What do you see? 

00:54:10
KEITH KOKSENG I see you. 

00:54:10
ALLEN IVEY And you know what I see? I see you looking at me. How do you imagine I might feel when I see you, I see you looking at me? 

00:54:20
KEITH KOKSENG Actually, it's kind of scary a little bit. 

00:54:25
ALLEN IVEY It's scary for you, huh? Yeah, I'll tell you what happens for me. I get the feeling that maybe you're more interested in me than when you're looking down. So one thing is just what's this, what's, what's the guys name next to you? 

00:54:40
KEITH KOKSENG Joe. 

00:54:40
Psychoeducational directive 

00:54:40
ALLEN IVEY Joe. Um, one thing that can help is look at me and think about what you see. Look at me and think about what I'm saying. What's going on in your head when you look at me and think about what I'm saying? 

00:55:05
KEITH KOKSENG I'm not really sure, just... 

00:55:05
ALLEN IVEY What's that? 

00:55:05
KEITH KOKSENG It's like a new experience really, but it's almost like talking, you know, listening and... 

00:55:15
ALLEN IVEY So the focus comes more outside than inside. 

00:55:15
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

00:55:20
ALLEN IVEY Just by simply maintaining eye contact. Uh, so, one of the first things we like to teach in listening skills is maintain eye contact. I wish I had a video here, 'cuz we take a video tape of you in conversation, and if you saw yourself in conversation, uh, we'd probably would see you like this. What do you see there? 

00:55:45
KEITH KOKSENG Well it doesn't look like you're paying attention and you're kind of sighing a lot. 

00:55:50
ALLEN IVEY Is that the type of, that's the type of person that looks like they wanna be isolated, isn't it? And you don't wanna be. 

00:55:55
KEITH KOKSENG No. 

00:55:55
Psychoeducational directive 

00:56:00
ALLEY IVEY So step one is, step two is, uh, you're sitting reasonably well, but sitting up straight, communicating. Uh, now, if you're gonna get me, get, what it tends to be in a situation like yours, when you're a little down, you're focused on yourself and what's going on in your head. Uh, what we'd like to do is have you focus on somebody else, and people love to have attention on themselves. So that means, listen to them. Let's imagine that I'm Mike. How could you possibly get Mike to talk so you don't have to focus on yourself? 

00:56:45
KEITH KOKSENG Um, be able to, you know, look like I'm talking to you and... 

00:56:50
ALLEN IVEY Look like you're interested. Yeah. 

00:56:55
KEITH KOKSENG Look like I'm interested and maybe talk about something that he's interested in. 

00:57:00
Role plays are basic 

00:57:00
ALLEN IVEY Um, to talk about. Okay. I'm gonna give a little clue on this, uh, I'm gonna role play Mike. One thing that helps is just asking questions, uh, that, that he might like to talk about. Uh, do you have any idea what Mike is interested in? 

00:57:20
KEITH KOKSENG Well he's always talking about the football game. 

00:57:20
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm.. How do you feel about football? 

00:57:25
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I like watching it sometimes, but it's not usually something that I do all the time. 

00:57:30
ALLEY IVEY I've got, I'll give you a little secret of communication; sometimes if we wanna get started we're gonna have to listen to stuff that we're not perfectly interested in. And sometimes I find when I do that, I get myself more interested. So let's, uh, let's try a little bit here of I'm Mike and, uh, hmm, uh, uh, and try and remember to look at me and then see what you can do to keep me going, what can you do to keep me talking? Uh, so, uh, gosh, you know, the Patriots lost that last game of the season. I couldn't believe how bad that was. It really was terrible. 

00:58:10
Nice paraphrase 

00:58:10
KEITH KOKSENG Sounds like you, uh, really like the Patriots. 

00:58:15
ALLEN IVEY You, you bet. I've been following them forever. And that Brady, when he broke his, uh, leg and had to go to San Diego and get that operation, uh, I think that destroyed the whole team, and that really, that really got to me, and the, the Patriots haven't been the same since. 

00:58:35
KEITH KOKSENG What, uh, when did you watch the game? 

00:58:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh, I watched the game, uh, I came home a little bit late and I, fortunately I put it on, uh, recorded it in DVR. And the good thing about that was I didn't have to watch all of the commercials, and so I could go through an hour game, you know. 

00:59:00
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah, I hate commercials. 

00:59:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I do to. It's, it's really nasty. 

00:59:10
[sil.] 

00:59:10
MICROTRAINING 

00:59:10
The client is already demonstrating good attending behavior. This can happen with a bright client who is ready and able to change. With psychiatric patients, getting this far might take three or more practice sessions over a week. 

00:59:10
Patience, persistence, and follow-up are essential 

00:59:25
ALLEN IVEY I'm gonna stop for a minute. Uh how was that for you? 

00:59:30
KEITH KOKSENG It was okay. You know, I, it feels a little uncomfortable at first. 

00:59:35
ALLEN IVEY A little awkward. 

00:59:35
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:59:35
ALLEN IVEY A little artificial? 

00:59:35
KEITH KOKSENG A little, a little bit. 

00:59:40
ALLEN IVEY You have to force yourself. 

00:59:40
KEITH KOKSENG Kind of. 

00:59:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. Well, what happened in me when you just listened? What did I do? 

00:59:45
KEITH KOKSENG You gave me more than I thought that you would in, in the conversation. 

00:59:50
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. And that's kinda what it boils down to, uh, is if you put your, if you ask the person questions, listen to them, people, pretty much egocentric, they like to talk about themselves. And if they're talking about themselves, eventually they'll say something interesting, but you gotta be patient. 'Cuz you you may get more about the Patriots from me than you want, but on the other hand, uh, it's, it's better, or if you're working on a job issue, sort of the same thing goes. Uh, now let's imagine, what was, let's imagine that we're working on a new campaign together and, uh, what would be, what would be a project you're working on with Mike? 

01:00:35
KEITH KOKSENG Um, probably just, uh, getting new clientele. 

01:00:50
ALLEN IVEY Getting new clientele. 

01:00:50
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. Setting them up for, uh, a new, you know, package for their work. 

01:01:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:01:05
[sil.] 

01:01:05
MICROTRAINING 

01:01:05
Sighing continues and will for awhile. More than one role-play practice per session is wise. 

01:01:10
ALLEN IVEY And, and getting clientele a new package for their work. 

01:01:10
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:01:10
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And what happens usually between you and Mike on a job? 

01:01:20
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I'll come up with a lot of the resources and he'll, you know, talk to, to the client. 

01:01:25
ALLEN IVEY So he does the talking? 

01:01:25
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:01:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh, okay. So, that's, but basically you're just gonna give him written resources, is that it? 

01:01:35
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

01:01:35
ALLEN IVEY (crosstalk) And he takes 'em. 

01:01:35
KEITH KOKSENG I do a lot of the research and I give it to him, he puts all the packages together and talks to the client. 

01:01:40
ALLEN IVEY (crosstalk) Yeah. Okay, so, uh, how do you suppose you can get Mike talking about one of those clients? 

01:01:50
KEITH KOKSENG Um. 

01:01:50
ALLEN IVEY So you might be able to get better packages. 

01:01:50
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I guess just, uh, seeing what, you know, he's interested in also, and what the, you know, what his interactions are with the clients as well. 

01:02:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Well, let's pretend I'm him and I've just come back from a client and I presented some of your research ideas and so I come in and say, uh, hi Keith. Uh, the research ideas that you gave me worked pretty well. 

01:02:15
KEITH KOKSENG Good. Uh, what specifically did you like about 'em? 

01:02:20
ALLEN IVEY I gotta comment here, perfect question. If you ask people for specific examples, you're gonna make me tell you a story. Well, the story is, I just had to break in and say that is such a good question for a person who has communication skills to ask. Well, I went into the firm and I laid them out and the guy was resistant at first, but then when he saw your idea, and I was able to put across because if it weren't for me he wouldn't have been able to have done it. But, he got enthused and he was almost ready to sign a contract. That was really good. 

01:03:00
KEITH KOKSENG Um, there's anything that helped to get him to sign it in the end? 

01:03:10
ALLEN IVEY Well, I'm not quite sure what to do to get him to sign in the end, but he, he's gonna talk to me again. Uh, do you have any ideas? 

01:03:15
KEITH KOKSENG I have a couple of ideas, if you'd like to go over them. 

01:03:20
MICROTRAINING 

01:03:20
Debriefing 

01:03:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Let's stop for now. Uh, see, Keith, uh, then we'll stop the demonstration, uh, and do a little debriefing. 

01:03:30
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:03:35
ALLEN IVEY In the ideal situation I would have a videotape of this and in the first session if you were talking, I'd actually say go, go and do the interview just like you would, and, and the person would see themselves, uh, with poor eye contact, and body language, etc. But, I've also done it just like I have here. That's what I did when, at Colorado State University the first time. It's very important to have that person contract to go out and do something afterwards, and it works, and again, it literally got people out of a psychiatric hospital. If you can listen and get other people going, you're halfway there, um, to getting along, in normal, typical society. What do you think of that? 

01:04:15
KEITH KOKSENG I think it's actually, you know, really helpful and useful. Most people would, you know, have problems keeping conversations a lot of times and it's because often they don't listen to each other. 

01:04:25
ALLEN IVEY It's also, uh, I'll extend this also to what we call enactment. A person comes in and say you had a problem with your spouse, your partner, lover, oh, or, or your boss. You go in and you role play what's going on and you get enacted in what's going on in the interview in the here and now, and the counselor, therapist, gets an understanding of what's going on. Then you can role play a better interaction which they can then (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:04:56
KEITH KOKSENG Right. 

01:04:56
ALLEN IVEY So it, that, it can basically teach skills but enactment is also part of what we can psychoeducation. So enacting here and now in live practice interactions that may make a big difference. So, uh, for you people out there, think about bringing the world outside into the interview, enacting situations, problematic situations, as they are, and then reenacting them for practice and contract for generalization. Also, this is a fantastic way to work with depression and also by the way, we use it with schizophrenics to help them stay on topic, I can go on. Great stuff. Thank you. Thank you Keith. 

01:05:40
KEITH KOKSENG Thank you.

Free Association Helping Clients Look More Deeply Into Life Experience and Its Meanings Topic: Exploring Job Stressors Allen E. Ivey, EdD, ABPP Keith Kokseng 

01:06:20
ALLEN IVEY Hey, Keith. We've been talking a little while now about your work at the Community Mental Health Center and, uh, just a review, uh, what I understand is, uh, how do you feel about your job and how are things going? Just to say it again. 

01:06:30
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. Well, I like my job, but it can be stressful at times, um, dealing with, uh, the clients and trying to get them services has been quite a problem, especially with, uh, dealing with the insurance companies. 

01:06:45
ALLEN IVEY So dealing with clients, uh, can you tell me more about how it feels when you're trying to help the clients and you got the insurance company in the way? 

01:06:50
KEITH KOKSENG Well, it becomes really stressful because you wanna provide services for the client, but the insurance companies have some sort of criteria for them to be able to be reim-, or, for them to reimburse us for giving services. 

01:07:05
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm.. So, we kinda got two things here, we got the client you wanna help. 

01:07:10
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:07:10
Inform client about new strategy 

01:07:10
ALLEN IVEY I sigh because I really understand. Uh, insurance companies are really, uh, non-helpful, non-helpful. But I'd like to try something which, you know, we've talked about in other sessions, but this time I'd like to focus on a very different thing, uh, this is what we call free association. I just wanna see what happens. 

01:07:30
KEITH KOKSENG (crosstalk) Okay. 

01:07:30
ALLEN IVEY And we both may be surprised, uh, 'cuz I hear two things. Uh, we'll try two of the things. But, I'd like you to tell me about a particular client where you got, tell me, you don't have to go into the details about the client, but generally what's going on with the client, where you're having trouble getting, I wanna know about the client. We'll talk about the insurance company later. 

01:07:50
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. Um, well I have one client who's, demonstrates a little conduct disorder, and doesn't really fall into the full criteria because he's so young, and he doesn't have the, uh, doesn't fully go against everybody's, uh, directions. 

01:08:10
ALLEN IVEY No. 

01:08:10
KEITH KOKSENG Um, the, we, we had him admitted but he's not following after the, the initial assessment, the, the full criteria so it's been a lot more difficult to get him to stay within the program. 

01:08:25
ALLEN IVEY So it's been difficult to get this, uh, kid to stay in the program, and you've got the insurance things. 

01:08:30
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:08:30
Free association lead, structuring 

01:08:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Wha, what I kinda wanna do so I said free association. I want a little, know a little bit more about what's going on between you and the client. 

01:08:35
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:08:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh, uh, what occurs to you when you think about this particular client? Just let anything come to your mind, just anything. It doesn't have to be related to the client. 

01:08:50
[sil.] 

01:08:50
MICROTRAINING 

01:08:50
Free association is straightforward strategy. "Let your mind go freely. What occurs to you about ...?" Aim for here and now experience 

01:08:55
KEITH KOKSENG Um, he's lonely. 

01:09:00
ALLEN IVEY What's that? 

01:09:00
KEITH KOKSENG He's lonely. 

01:09:00
ALLEN IVEY He's lonely. 

01:09:00
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:09:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And how does lonely feel to you? 

01:09:05
KEITH KOKSENG Sad. 

01:09:05
ALLEN IVEY Sad. Okay. Could you talk about it a little bit farther? What occurs to you when you hear that word sad? 

01:09:15
KEITH KOKSENG Just, uh, kind of depressing, and away from others. 

01:09:15
ALLEN IVEY Away from others. Okay. Now I'm going to switch a little bit further. I'd like to say, have you ever felt that feeling of sad yourself? 

01:09:25
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:09:30
[sil.] 

01:09:30
MICROTRAINING 

01:09:30
What's going on here? Clients often bring out certain feelings in us. This relates to transference. It is important to be aware of these feelings so that we do not mix "our thing" with the client's world. 

01:09:40
ALLEN IVEY So, away from others. Okay, now I'm going to switch a little bit further, I'd like to say, have you ever felt that feeling of sad yourself? 

01:09:45
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:09:50
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Uh, what occurs to you, just let it, let, let any words come to your mind when you hear that word sad. 

01:09:55
KEITH KOKSENG Lo-... 

01:10:00
ALLEN IVEY (crosstalk) Just words. 

01:10:00
KEITH KOKSENG Lonely, um, despair, um, isolation, um, kind of just... 

01:10:15
ALLEN IVEY And you get that feeling, isolation, in your own, uh, body somewhere? 

01:10:20
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:10:20
ALLEN IVEY Where? 

01:10:20
KEITH KOKSENG Usually in the stomach. 

01:10:20
ALLEN IVEY In the stomach. So that feeling of loneliness is in the pit of the stomach. Let's go back to your client. Uh, that's kind of what we came (inaudible ) determining your own experience of loneliness. 

01:10:35
[sil.] 

01:10:35
MICROTRAINING 

01:10:35
What's going on here? Allen seeks to enable Keith to see how his own feelings about loneliness might enable him to understand the client better. 

01:10:35
He very briefly asks Keith to note the body feelings associated with loneliness. When a counselor notes personal body feelings, it can be a clue as to what is happening with the client. 

01:10:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh, what occurs to you, just let it, let, let any word comes to your mind when you hear that word sad. 

01:11:00
KEITH KOKSENG Lo-... 

01:11:00
ALLEN IVEY (crosstalk) Just words. 

01:11:00
KEITH KOKSENG Lonely, um, despair, um, isolation, um, kind of just... 

01:11:15
ALLEN IVEY And you get that feeling, isolation, in your own, uh, body somewhere? 

01:11:20
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:11:25
ALLEN IVEY Where? 

01:11:25
Locating emotion in the body 

01:11:25
KEITH KOKSENG Usually in the pit of the stomach. 

01:11:25
ALLEN IVEY In the stomach. So that feeling of loneliness in the pit of the stomach. Let's go back to your client, uh, that's kind of what we came (inaudible ) determine your own experience of loneliness. Uh, do you sense that, do you think that, I understand you said that client was lonely or did I hear, hear you incorrectly? 

01:11:40
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. I, I think he's lonely 

01:11:45
ALLEN IVEY How has he expressed that? 

01:11:45
KEITH KOKSENG Um, I think he expresses it through his defiance, that no one understands him, and that his aggression, and his violent nature, his, uh, defiances is, is scared because of his sad and loneliness. Because he's, uh, not really taken care of properly as, um, with proper supervision or care. 

01:12:10
ALLEN IVEY I hear a lot of understanding there. You're able to go beyond that resistance and nastiness because that behavior is really is indicating of something else. 

01:12:15
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm. 

01:12:15
Positive feedback 

01:12:20
ALLEN IVEY And I, I really feel good when I hear you say that type of thing. So you're basically pretty, pretty much able to empathize with him. 

01:12:25
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:12:25
MICROTRAINING 

01:12:25
Client counselor relationship 

01:12:30
ALLEN IVEY Now let's just, for the moment, turn to the insurance company. Uh, you're on the, uh, do you get on the phone with the insurance company? I sigh again. Uh, when you're on the phone with that insurance company, uh, what's going, what happens? 

01:12:45
KEITH KOKSENG Well, basically, you, you trying to get these services and they're asking for some sort of documentation and what services are going to be needed. Um, we often feel that they need a combination of therapy, case management, and often times, medication. Sometimes they won't give us enough hours for therapy and, um, and case management be, because they don't think he qualifies, or the person qualifies, for that much. 

01:13:15
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm, and how did it go when you talked with him particular, about him particularly? 

01:13:15
KEITH KOKSENG Because he didn't fall into the specific criteria, um, they didn't give us more than half the hours than we, honestly, we would require for him to make some sort of progress. 

01:13:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. I'd like for you to imagine you're on the telephone with this guy, woman, man, woman? 

01:13:30
KEITH KOKSENG Man. 

01:13:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay, could you tell me a little about the conversation? 

01:13:35
KEITH KOKSENG Well, he was pretty straightforward, and he wasn't rude or anything, but it was very frustrating in my end because we, you know, we've had experience previously with other clients that we ha-, we've seen similar situations, and they would need more hours, in my opinion and my supervisor's opinion, um, to make some sort of progress. 

01:13:55
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm.. So you said frustrated? 

01:14:00
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:14:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay. What is, tell me a little more, okay, we hear that word frustrated, let's try that free association again. What words come in your mind when you think about that frustration you feel? 

01:14:10
KEITH KOKSENG Uh, pressure, anger, um, difficulty, um, unacceptance. Just words like that kind of focus on me. 

01:14:25
Restate feelings, search for body feelings 

01:14:25
ALLEN IVEY Difficulty, acceptance, frustration, anger. Uh, again, uh, k-, kinda where would you feel that, uh, frustration in your body? 

01:14:35
KEITH KOKSENG More in my head. 

01:14:35
ALLEN IVEY In your head, okay. Uh, now I'd go just a little farther with that. Let's move away from, uh, the patient and insurance company. Uh, just let anything occurs, I'd like ya, what occurs to you when you get that feeling in your head about some other situation in your life? Something that's happened in the past where you've had that same feeling in your head. What, what occurs to you that might relate to that? 

01:14:55
What occurs to you? 

01:15:00
KEITH KOKSENG Um, inability to accomplish a task or, you know, failure to focus on something. 

01:15:05
ALLEN IVEY Can you tell me about a specific time that you visualize or think about? 

01:15:10
KEITH KOKSENG What comes to mind often is, uh, school. Well, um, when there would be like a test that I would have to study for it'd be very frustrating because the professor would give you all this material from chapters 1 through x, or whatever, and you're given a small amount of time to learn the material, and be tested on it. 

01:15:35
ALLEN IVEY So that frustration and tension, I don't know, for me sometimes my head feels like exploding it that situation. I don't know if that's you or not. 

01:15:40
KEITH KOKSENG I, it's, uh, it's not an exploding feeling, it's more like a headache or a pull, a tension pull, um, kind of like here. 

01:15:50
ALLEN IVEY So you can go back to the insurance company they're a big headache maybe. 

01:15:55
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:15:55
Interpretation 

01:15:55
ALLEN IVEY Now, so, you really have, uh, there really is a, is a feeling. At the same time you really wanna help that client. 

01:16:05
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:16:10
[sil.] 

01:16:10
MICROTRAINING 

01:16:10
Why all this? First, we need to know what's going on inside us so that we do not mix our thing with the client. Second, what occurs in our body and feelings gives us clues as to what is going on with he client. Free association with a body focus increase depth of understanding. 

01:16:10
What occurs to you? 

01:16:20
ALLEN IVEY what occurs to you when you think about, you really wanna help? 

01:16:25
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I wanna be able to provide the services that we can, um, and, you know, give this person a chance because he's younger, he's chi, he's an adolescent child who has had a lot of up, and, you know, hardships. We've looked through his chart, and we've had the admission, and went through the initial interview with the, our clinician who, who did the assessment, but of course I sat in it. 

01:16:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:16:45
KEITH KOKSENG Um, and there's a lot of hardships on this individual, and for me, you know, it's if this, this client of ours was given an opportunity he might be able to succeed in life, as opposed to all the anger that he demonstrates now. 

01:17:05
ALLEN IVEY So I really hear a strong desire to help him. 

01:17:05
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:17:05
Brief self-disclosure 

01:17:10
ALLEN IVEY We've got the frustration, uh, the pressure, etc. Uh, uh, or concern about his loneliness and you seem to be able to feel a lot of those things that he might be dealing with, and also I guess, that he's unaware of. Uh, uh, I'll just make a little addition to this, uh, if I were in your situation I would feel a little burdened. Do you feel any burden in that thing? 

01:17:30
KEITH KOKSENG I do. 

01:17:35
ALLEN IVEY Would you tell me, is that a reasonable word? 

01:17:35
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah, it is. 

01:17:35
What occurs to you? 

01:17:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, okay. What occurs you if I, when I use that word burden? What, what things come across your mind? 

01:17:40
KEITH KOKSENG Again, with pressure, and responsibility, and, um, it's just the focus on having to accomplish the task. 

01:17:50
Search for body sense 

01:17:50
ALLEN IVEY And, uh, you got it. Keith, where, where might you feel that burden in, in your life? 

01:18:00
KEITH KOKSENG Uh, most people would say on the shoulders, but honestly for me it's, it's more of a head thing. 

01:18:05
ALLEN IVEY More in the head. 

01:18:05
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:18:05
ALLEN IVEY Is there a specific place in the head, by any chance? 

01:18:05
KEITH KOKSENG No, it's, it's more just an overall general feeling of pressure in general. So stress and thinking. 

01:18:10
Here and now debriefing summary 

01:18:10
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. So I think maybe this is what I've been trying to do here, is to say, uh, when you're dealing with an insurance company, when you're dealing with a client, there's a lot going on inside us. Uh, and it relates a lot to our own past history. Uh, I'm just curious if there's anything, so far, that you've observed as we've gone through some of these different associations, just not simple, but difficult issue as the insurance company, is there anything that's stuck out to you, anything that sticks out for you from our conversation, so far? 

01:18:45
KEITH KOKSENG Um, really kind of like the growing up phase. Um, you know, just sometimes I would feel a lot of pressure and stress from trying to accomplish a task, and feeling sometimes maybe that if I had a better chance, or this, someone to help me out with other opportunities, I might have been more successful in a certain area of my life. 

01:19:15
[sil.] 

01:19:15
MICROTRAINING 

01:19:15
Life Patterns Exploration has led the client to think about past life patterns 

01:19:20
ALLEN IVEY So you kinda go back to even, as you think about this kid you think about yourself in your earlier life. 

01:19:25
KEITH KOKSENG Somewhat. 

01:19:25
Interpretation 

01:19:25
ALLEN IVEY That's a, that's kind of a free association itself, so. There is a, in the psychoanalytic theory, you're (inaudible ) in the psychoanalytic theory there is that repitition of stuff from the past and the present, and we do have, uh, make the interpretation. I mean we do have a little bit of the past repeating itself in the pressure, the explosions, uh, and the feelings, the various feelings in your body that perhaps you felt earlier. Does that make sense to you? 

01:19:55
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:19:55
ALLEN IVEY Alright. Uh, now if we were to get into real therapy, in which we're not, uh, I would be, I would go back to specifics, uh, Keith, on what happened back then, and sometimes those earlier events are very helpful, and then we'd free associate on those, and we go in surprising directions. Uh, and we've been already in surprising directions for both of us, what were some surprises for you? 

01:20:25
KEITH KOKSENG The comparison between myself and actually my client. 

01:20:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay. We call this relationship, and relationships are complex. 

01:20:35
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:20:35
ALLEN IVEY And, uh, I'm kinda doing this as, uh, giving you a little sense of this, but. Uh, I think the, uh, psychodynamic, psychoanalytic stuff, uh, not my favorite thing, but at times can be really helpful. 

01:20:45
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:20:45
ALLEN IVEY And understanding what goes on in the relationship. 

01:20:50
MICROTRAINING 

01:20:50
Here and Now Immediacy 

01:20:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh, another way to go at this, a little more risky for both you and me, is you think about working with me right now, what occurs to you? 

01:21:10
KEITH KOKSENG Mmm. In what sense, do you mean? 

01:21:10
ALLEN IVEY In whatever, in, just as I asked that question. What occurs to you, and whatever comes to your mind, word, thought, other earlier situations? 

01:21:20
KEITH KOKSENG I'm not really sure actually. Uh, in working with you, do you mean like as you as my client, or in this process right now? 

01:21:30
ALLEN IVEY In the process here and now. 

01:21:30
KEITH KOKSENG I think it's been actually very helpful in understanding the, uh, you know, the fundamentals of a relationship, and personality in general. 

01:21:40
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm., mmhmm. I thank you for that, that it's been helpful, uh, I'm still kinda looking for, uh, what are your, what, just let it go freely, just let a word come in your mind, a situation. You're looking pretty intense now. That old deep breath we think about, and just whatever occurs to you as I say, what's going on between you and me? 

01:22:05
KEITH KOKSENG Just a lot of, uh, understanding, and kind of, figuring out what's going on. 

01:22:10
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm., okay. Can you go back to other situations earlier in your life when you had some of those same feelings of understanding. 

01:22:20
KEITH KOKSENG Almost like a professor. 

01:22:25
ALLEN IVEY Almost like a professor? 

01:22:25
KEITH KOKSENG Almost like a professor sometimes. 

01:22:25
ALLEN IVEY Well, that's what I am. Uh-huh. Can you think of some moments of understanding that were helpful. 

01:22:35
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:22:35
ALLEN IVEY Biggest part of what we're doing a lot of stuff in the head, but you didn't understand it. So you first with the me and you here and now it's the understanding of things? 

01:22:45
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:22:45
ALLEN IVEY Any emotional things that happen inside of understand, cuz that's kind of a cognitive word. 

01:22:50
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. Um, not so much as more like, student teacher feelings, as emotion of learning, and understanding and trying. 

01:23:00
Interpretation 

01:23:00
ALLEN IVEY 'Cuz there's a little hierarchy between you and me. 

01:23:00
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:23:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, uhhuh. And, what, what about hierarchy where do you go with hierarchy in terms of me being here and you being there? 

01:23:10
KEITH KOKSENG Just as you said it, um, I'm not, as a professional it's still professional, but still not, um, as a prowess as, as you have. 

01:23:20
ALLEN IVEY The power? 

01:23:20
KEITH KOKSENG The prowess. 

01:23:20
ALLEN IVEY Huh? 

01:23:20
KEITH KOKSENG The prowess, the, um, the prestige, the, uh, um, experience, the, everything that you've obtained from up now, compared to where I am, my career in my life. 

01:23:40
[sil.] 

01:23:40
MICROTRAINING 

01:23:40
What's going on here? We are examining the here and now relationship between counselor and client. There are constant unsaid back and forth thoughts and feelings between counselor and client. 

01:23:40
The client has TRANSFERRED feelings from other situations to the immediate relationship with he counselor. 

01:23:50
ALLEN IVEY I think we could go a lot farther with that, in terms of how you deal with authority. We could go back to parent, we're not going to at this point, back to parents. So I really represent in some ways an authority figure, and most of us have mixed feelings about authority figures. I do. And you can see again we could go on in some length in relationship to that. And getting back finally to the insurance company what you're dealing with. 

01:24:15
Client makes link/interpretation 

01:24:20
KEITH KOKSENG A sort of authority figure obviously, but at the same time there's that back and forth of being, how, you know, understanding they are the authority figure and still getting frustrated because they're not giving me what I need. 

01:24:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah. I'm going to end this by saying I wish I had some comfort for you in dealing with insurance. Uh, I say sometimes I start going above to the supervisor above (crosstalk). 

01:24:45
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

01:24:50
ALLEN IVEY You've probably tried that as well, and they're usually just about as nasty. But, uh, It is a real issue and the thing is all I like to point out is, there is a lot more going on in every interpersonal reaction. 

01:25:00
KEITH KOKSENG Mm-hmm.. 

01:25:00
ALLEN IVEY And, now just, we'll step back and just do a little debriefing of this. 

01:25:05
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:25:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh, what did you think of the whole strategy technique of free association? 

01:25:10
MICROTRAINING 

01:25:10
Debriefing Demonstration 

01:25:15
KEITH KOKSENG Um, it was actually very helpful. At first it was a little confusing because y, y, I'm not really sure which direction you're going, um, most (crosstalk) 

01:25:25
ALLEN IVEY I'm not going in any direction. 

01:25:25
KEITH KOKSENG Exactly, and most things I'm being exposed to are more direction oriented. Even the words free association I, I get the fact that it's, you know, you're just associating with whatever is around you. But, it was difficult at first and then slowly as you started to interpret it made me kind of focus in and understand what was, you know, that there are these relationships and these, um, connections that I wasn't aware of. 

01:25:50
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah. We can also say interpretation is, another word is, linking. 

01:25:55
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:25:55
Free association facilitates linking of ideas/feelings 

01:25:55
ALLEN IVEY Linking the past the present, linking what's going on and linking can be pretty helpful in counseling. Uh, I think we're probably, we're not, this is not the only way to do things, but I do find this is a helpful strategy I think all of us should have to use sometimes, particularly when you're stuck. Let's try free association, something might happen, what do you think? 

01:26:20
KEITH KOKSENG Actually it was pretty helpful. 

01:26:20
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Let's let it go for today. 

01:26:20
KEITH KOKSENG Alright. 

01:26:20
ALLEN IVEY Thanks. 

01:26:20
KEITH KOKSENG Thank you. 

01:26:25
[sil.] 

01:26:25
MICROTRAINING 

01:26:25
In this session, Allen 1. Used "What occurs to you?" to open free association 2. Sought body feelings to concretize feelings 3. Searched for links between the past and present 4. Examined how past experience repeats itself in the present 5. Explored here and now relationships between himself and client 

01:26:25
The client's feelings toward you are important - as are your unconscious feelings toward the client.
