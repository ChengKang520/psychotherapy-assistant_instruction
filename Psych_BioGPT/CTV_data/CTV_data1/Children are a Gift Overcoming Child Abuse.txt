CHILDREN ARE A GIFT produced by Mona Hennein 

00:00:05
DAVID PELZER Author, "A Child Called It" 

00:00:05
DAVID PELZER I wasn't allowed to look at people in the eye. I didn't have nice clothes. I had no life, no life for eight years. And I wasn't allowed to wear glasses unless it was for school. I didn't care. I didn't even really identify with myself as a human being. I mean, I existed. I fed myself and did what I had to do. 

00:00:45
MONA HENNEIN David Pelzer grew up in Daily City, California. Although he was the middle of five brothers, he was the only child targeted for his mother's abuse. 

00:00:50
DAVID PELZER She was very diabolical in how she would control me. Either have me swallow ammonia, either lock me in bathroom or in a closet, either submerge me in a bathtub full of, uh, cold water, have me stand a certain way. 

00:01:05
MONA HENNEIN It wasn't long before control became all there was to David's relationship with his mother because, to her, David was no longer a son, but an it. 

00:01:15
DAVID PELZER If I looked at anybody, that was a crime. If I didn't do the dinner dishes, wash and dry them and put 'em away in five seconds or less, no food for It. And it was just over time, it's like a, it's almost like, you know, an anaconda in a sense. You know, oh what a pretty little snake. Oh, it's gonna give me a hug. Oh, it's cute. And then after a while, bam, you're being squeezed. Now you should have known from the get go but I'm, I, you know, I was a very little boy and I was very naï¿½ve. You know, I was, you know, I want to say I was stupid, sure, but a lot of kids are kinda like that and again, I felt I deserved it. 

00:01:45
MONA HENNEIN Primary Focus 

00:01:45
MONA HENNEIN What David felt he deserved from his mother and the way he was treated were two different things. One of the major differences was over food. For David, even the spoiled table scraps he was fed at home became a luxury and eventually, the only decent place he could find anything to eat was at school, in other children's lunch boxes. You were hungry a lot as a kid? 

00:02:05
DAVID PELZER Always hungry. When my mom would basically have me go home at approximately once a day. It's called, I call it the game of recall and have me regurgitate to proven I hadn't stolen any food that hour. 

00:02:20
 My earliest memory is just finding him in the closet, um, looking for food and eating the children's lunches. 

00:02:25
MONA HENNEIN Athena Konstan was David's fourth grade teacher. She knew his mother as the popular president of the school PTA and had no reason not to believe her stories. 

00:02:35
ATHENA KONSTAN David's teacher 

00:02:35
ATHENA KONSTAN She would say to me that, oh, Mrs. Konstan, he has plenty of food. He has his lunch. He doesn't need that. Uh, he eats well at home. So of course she was totally contradictory to anything that David would report to us. 

00:02:50
MONA HENNEIN Joyce Woodward, David's fifth grade teacher was equally taken in. 

00:02:55
JOYCE WOODWORTH David's teacher 

00:02:55
JOYCE WOODWORTH And she's also very convincing that Dave was making up these stories. 

00:03:00
MONA HENNEIN Mm-hmm. 

00:03:00
JOYCE WOODWORTH Uh, for attention. 

00:03:00
DAVID PELZER Well, there was two different personalities. There was my mommy, who was just a very beautiful woman, very gracious, the most caring person you're ever gonna meet on this planet, and then there was another persona that I called the mother, that was very diabolical, very premeditated and very evil. 

00:03:25
MONA HENNEIN A diabolical mother who taught her son to play games of survival, some of them deadly. 

00:03:30
DAVID PELZER My mom had a game, uh, you know, ammonia and Clorox. It was a mixture she would put together and I have no idea to this day how she thought of this, because it's very chemicals and (inaudible ) and it's really bad. And this is a, a noxious fume that will basically kill you, you know, in less than an hour. 

00:03:45
MONA HENNEIN Dave's mother would lock him in the bathroom with this toxic solution. 

00:03:50
DAVID PELZER And it strips the lining from your esophagus or your lungs fill with a thick mucus and I believe, a doctor told me I think it's called dry land drowning. 

00:03:55
ATHENA KONSTAN And he had all these splotches all over his, uh, all over his face and of course we determined later that that was probably from the Clorox and the ammonia. 

00:04:05
STEVEN ZIEGLER David's teacher 

00:04:05
STEVEN ZIEGLER He was a very, very small, unkempt child. He was suspected of doing a lot of theft out of, uh, student's lunches and not well liked. 

00:04:20
MONA HENNEIN Steve Ziegler had just begun teaching when he first had Dave Pelzer in his classroom. 

00:04:25
STEVEN ZIEGLER You tolerated him because he was assigned to your class but that was about it. You simply tolerated his presence in class. 

00:04:35
MONA HENNEIN While teachers were tolerating David in class, at home, his life was becoming more and more dangerous. 

00:04:40
DAVID PELZER Author, "A Child Called It" 

00:04:40
DAVID PELZER My mom had, uh, held my arm over a gas stove for many, many seconds and it burned the, the, the skin and, and started to burn some of the flesh and I remember my brother Ronald, God bless him, he came home about five minutes early from his Boy Scout meeting. My mom's blood just drained from her face because her biggest thing back then was she only did this when my father was gone and when my brother's weren't really home. You know, this, this, she had like a dual personality and she just basically threw me down to the bottom of the stairs and I just remember, you know, purging, letting out these feelings, you know, why are you doing this to me? You know, I thought I got good grades in school. I try to stay out of your way. I try not to make any noise. I try to make you happy. And as I purged out these feelings, I remember feeling my arm beginning to blister and I thought to myself very quickly well, if I can feel 'em, it means I'm alive, which means I'm not dead, which means oh my gosh, I won. 

00:05:30
MONA HENNEIN That day became a turning point in David's life. When the next day at school, Ziegler began to take notice. 

00:05:40
STEVEN ZIEGLER He was making every effort to pull these sleeves down and hide his arms under the desk or under the chair. 

00:05:45
MONA HENNEIN Steve Ziegler's first thought was that David was trying to disrupt the class. 

00:05:50
STEVEN ZIEGLER I remember seeing his hands and his arms. They weren't just rosy red from perhaps being out in the sun or something. They were just blistered and peeling and open wounds. His, both his arms were just, the, it seems like the top layer of skin had just been ripped off. 

00:06:10
MONA HENNEIN Primary Focus 

00:06:10
MONA HENNEIN Thirty years ago, child abuse was something that happened at home and that teachers were not trained to recognize or even handle and in David's case, school officials were equally unsympathetic. 

00:06:20
JOYCE WOODWORTH They find, said well, you have to document it. 

00:06:25
MONA HENNEIN The three teachers started making notes of every one of David's scars, bruises, and injuries. 

00:06:30
JOYCE WOODWORTH And finally after about three months, we had enough and they, they came out and took David out of the home. 

00:06:35
STEVEN ZIEGLER At that point, he was pulled out and that was it. I, I don't recall ever seeing him after that. 

00:06:40
DAVID PELZER I, I went to the hospital and they inspected me for several hours and, you know, took care of me and then they took me in temporary foster care and a couple months later, I was made a ward of the court and to me it was like wow, birthday. It was just a brand new life. You know, I got to wear glasses. I got to play with other kids. I got to eat candy bars. 

00:07:00
MONA HENNEIN To this day, David Pelzer calls the teachers at Thomas Edison School his rescue workers and as for the foster parents who took him in? He says they changed him from the boy called It to the man called Dave. 

00:07:10
DAVID PELZER The one thing I'll never forget is in the bottom of the basement, I raised my arm. I made a promise to God. I says if you can get me out of this, I will never, ever quit. If you can get me out of this, I will give everything my best shot.

PATTY BOLTON foster parent 

00:07:30
PATTY BOLTON Children are truly a gift from God but a lot of people don't look at it like that and, you know, you, you won't have 'em forever and you just nurture 'em and cherish 'em while you have 'em and spoil 'em. All of mine are spoiled and I tell people, but that's what they're given to us for, is to just spoil 'em. 

00:07:50
MONA HENNEIN Foster parents Gary and Patty Bolton have a level five home, which means they take in some of the worst cases in the state of Texas. 

00:08:00
PATTY BOLTON Two. I'm the iron. I landed on Kim and now I owe her. 

00:08:05
MONA HENNEIN They're raising four foster children and a fifth that they adopted. Except for Angela, their children are still wards of the state and cannot be identified here but they all have harrowing stories of survival. Like 15 year old Jenny who's been living with the Bolton's since she was 9. 

00:08:20
PATTY BOLTON This was a child that was not only physically abused, verbally abused, mother did lots of drugs and alcohol, um, but they also didn't have a lot of food and she would literally give up her food when they did have it for her little sister to the point she became anorexic. 

00:08:40
MONA HENNEIN Kim, their 13 year old daughter, is one of the most tragic abuse victims in all of Texas. 

00:08:50
PATTY BOLTON Lots of sexual abuse. Um, not just by parents. They would have parties, um, and let other people have their way with her. So, I mean, just very, very rough. 

00:09:05
GARY BOLTON Pull and see if it's got oil in it. Pull it out and read it. 

00:09:10
MONA HENNEIN And the Bolton's took in two more, Patrick who's 15 and his sister Tina, who's 11. 

00:09:15
PATTY BOLTON We're not quite for sure if there was drugs but there was lots of alcohol, lots of, uh, verbal abuse and, um, physical abuse between the mother and father. Boy when you say bring the towels, they bring 'em. 

00:09:25
MONA HENNEIN Over the years, the Bolton's have learned that raising children is never easy and raising children from troubled home is often just plain hard. 

00:09:35
PATTY BOLTON foster parent 

00:09:35
PATTY BOLTON Believe me, you're gonna get holes punched in walls, doors, um, busted, glass broken, your things broken. I love you too. 

00:09:45
MONA HENNEIN But as hard as it is, Patty has no doubt that it's all worth it. 

00:09:50
PATTY BOLTON And you know what? Those things don't mean nothing. You just have to realize, they're not as important as that child. The child is the most important thing. These are only momentos. They can be replaced but that child can't. And so what you set with that child is gonna go with them for the rest of their lives. 

00:10:10
MONA HENNEIN Patty and Gary Bolton have been working with the Arrow Foundation, a foster placement agency that was founded by this man. Mark Tennant, a former foster child, is now using his experience to fight the epidemic of child abuse. 

00:10:25
MARK TENNANT Founder, The Arrow Project 

00:10:25
MARK TENNANT They need to know that in spite of the circumstances, in spite of the situations that they face, uh, that they can rely on unconditional love and acceptance from a mom, from a dad, or from an adult that's involved in their life. 

00:10:40
MONA HENNEIN As a child, Mark knew violence all too well. 

00:10:45
MARK TENNANT I recall taking a butcher knife to bed with me on one occasion and hiding it under my pillow for fear of this was the night that he would come after me or come after my mom. Uh, I would be the protector. It was a very violent and physical family, so I lived with that kind of fear and particularly for my mom's life and really fearful for my own. 

00:11:05
MONA HENNEIN Mark's parents divorced when he was 10 years old but his life changed from bad to worse when his mother remarried and his stepfather moved into their home. 

00:11:15
MARK TENNANT As a 10 year old, if you think about it, we should be enjoying milk and cookies if you will, doing homework, watching programs, and I'm trying to watch that program but I'm also plotting how I can take those drapes, put them over my face to protect my eyes, and go through that glass window. I had to be in a mode of survival. 

00:11:35
MONA HENNEIN When Mark was finally placed in foster care, he thought his troubles were over but he soon found himself being abused again. 

00:11:45
MARK TENNANT Not physically, uh, but emotionally, uh, by the foster mom telling me that, uh, she hated me and didn't want me there. And even as a child then, I, I understood that these homes were called Love Homes and I figured out real early boy, if this is a love home, I'm not sure that I want it. 

00:12:05
MONA HENNEIN With two abusive homes behind him, Mark was sent to live with a third family, to the home of Bill and Joan Mack. 

00:12:10
MARK TENNANT I created a lot of havoc in the home, began to cause a great deal of disharmony in the home, physically aggressive and verbally abusive to my younger siblings, verbally abusive, uh, to my foster mom, humiliating her in public. 

00:12:25
JOAN MACK foster parent 

00:12:25
JOAN MACK I think what Mark was doing was saying hey, instead of being kicked out of this home, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be in charge. I'm gonna be the one, uh, that's gonna pick whether I wanna leave or not. So I think he was testing me to see, uh, well, we'll see if you really do love me. 

00:12:45
PRIMARY focus 

00:12:45
MARK TENNANT Uh, my own mother rejected me. I've had two other foster family breakdowns, uh, so there, there's something happening here that probably is going to fail as well, history would, would indicate that. I've been rejected. These folks are probably going to reject me too. 

00:13:00
MONA HENNEIN As a foster child, Mark continued to rebel against his parents. Mark soon discovered something in his new foster parents that he never experienced. 

00:13:15
MARK TENNANT And no matter what I did, they seemed to stick in there with me. I began to think that this can't be real. 

00:13:20
MONA HENNEIN Testing the limits even more, he led his whole high school sophomore class in a plot to cheat on a biology exam. Then, made sure his parents found out. 

00:13:30
JOAN MACK foster parent 

00:13:30
JOAN MACK That point, whatever led up to that, I was angry and I just walked, slammed the door to the closet and of course Mark remembers vividly how it came off the hinges and I stormed out of the house. 

00:13:45
MONA HENNEIN Mark fully expected that he would be sent away forever and while he was packing, the Macks decided to pray for guidance. 

00:13:50
MARK TENNANT Founder, The Arrow Project 

00:13:50
MARK TENNANT And so supernaturally, God began to respond and, for them by working in my heart so much so that I took the initiative, which I don't think I ever did, uh, to say I'm sorry and, uh, sheepishly interrupted their prayer meeting and said I'm sorry. I want to stay. 

00:14:15
MONA HENNEIN Today, Mark Tennant finds it hard to believe that he has a chance to help children who are hurting like he once had been. 

00:14:25
MARK TENNANT You know, it is a miracle and it says that God can do things in spite of me. Uh, there's no explanation or there's no reason to believe I can do what I'm doing today. 

00:14:35
MONA HENNEIN The Reverend James Crabbe and his wife Sheila have been working with Mark Tennant's Arrow Project. 

00:14:40
SHEILA CRABBE I said we were gonna have pizza tonight. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN Yay! 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yay! 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yay! 

00:14:45
MONA HENNEIN They've been foster parents to nearly 80 children over the last 11 years. 

00:14:50
SHEILA CRABBE I'll give everybody a choice of whatever kind of pizza they want. 

00:14:55
MONA HENNEIN As foster parents, the Crabbe's take children from the toughest environments. 

00:14:55
REV. JAMES CRABBE They're raised by either individuals who wanna be gang members or actual gang members and, um, or they become a gang. 

00:15:05
MONA HENNEIN You brought gang members into your home? 

00:15:10
SHEILA CRABBE Oh yeah. 

00:15:10
REV. JAMES CRABBE (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:15:10
SHEILA CRABBE From wanna be's to tear drops. 

00:15:10
REV. JAMES CRABBE (crosstalk) To tear drops over the eyes who actually have tear drops. 

00:15:15
SHEILA CRABBE (crosstalk) Over the eyes that indicate how many kills, how many people they've killed. 

00:15:15
REV. JAMES CRABBE Yes. 

00:15:20
SHEILA CRABBE Yes. 

00:15:20
MONA HENNEIN Why would you bring gang members into your home and raise them? 

00:15:20
SHEILA CRABBE They're children. 

00:15:25
REV. JAMES CRABBE They all need someone to care for them in the appropriate way. 

00:15:30
SHEILA CRABBE And they need a sense of belonging in a more natural way and a more nurturing way and that's all the gang was, was just a sense of belonging because they didn't have that out on the streets. 

00:15:40
REV. JAMES CRABBE (crosstalk) A family. 

00:15:40
SHEILA CRABBE They didn't have that at home. 

00:15:40
MONA HENNEIN The Crabbe's see their job as giving children a chance to experience a different way of life. 

00:15:45
SHEILA CRABBE You can live with people and not be molested. Male or female. You can live with a family and be fed. You can live with a family and be loved. You can live with a family and be disciplined appropriately and they get an opportunity to see that by living with us and the years that we've been working with them and then we allow them to make that choice. We don't try to change anyone. We just present them with options that they never would have had otherwise, if the system hadn't picked them up. 

00:16:20
MONA HENNEIN The children learn that life has its ups and downs and is filled with choices that are right and wrong. 

00:16:25
SHEILA CRABBE I'm not gonna sell drugs for you and I'm not gonna give my body up for you to get drugs for you. 

00:16:35
REV. JAMES CRABBE (crosstalk) I'm, I'm, to another person. 

00:16:35
SHEILA CRABBE They've been presented with boundaries that they're not even knowledgeable of the meaning of the word, from you need to wear a robe because there's a man in the house. 

00:16:45
REV. JAMES CRABBE They have to learn structure and when it's time to do one thing and time to do the other and boys, you wear your shirt when there are women around. You don't have your pants down there on your knee caps and, and, uh, you tear, learn how to talk ma'am and sir and, um, if you have nothing to say, say nothing. Don't use the street language here. It's just not where we do it. 

00:17:10
SHEILA CRABBE My treat to go back to school. This is mine. This is mine. This is mine. 

00:17:20
MONA HENNEIN More importantly, the Crabbe's hope that these children will take home the lessons that they've learned here. 

00:17:25
REV. JAMES CRABBE All I'm doing is presenting Jesus Christ because that's who Jesus is. Giving us a life lessons to live by and it's not about the successes as much as it is about putting something into their lives that they can take with them, no matter where they go, no matter how, uh, they end up. That's something in their life that we have helped to change.

SHEILA CRABBE And I even try to explain how maybe Mom wasn't able to take care of them like she would have liked to because she didn't have a chance. She didn't know. You know, I'll show 'em, look. On her birth certificate, she was 16 and she had you and how old are you now? You're 16. Could you handle a child? Would you know what to do? And that kinda helps them get past some of that anger.
