DR. DERALD WING SUE  Now, I, I have the distinct honor this morning of introducing, uhm, a true brother. Uhm, Dr. Thomas Parham is first and foremost a family man with his wife who lives, ah, in this area with his wife, Devita(ph), and youngest daughter, Kenya(ph). He is Assistant Vice-Chancellor, Counseling and Health Services and Director of the Counseling Center at the University of California, Irvine. His ground-breaking work in the psygolo, psychology of Nigrescence and racial identity has increased our understanding of not only African-Americans, but other racial ethnic minority groups as well. Dr. Parham is co-author with Dr. Joe White of the highly-acclaimed book, "The Psychology of Blacks: An African-American Perspective." He is author of "Psychological Storms: The African-American Struggle for Identity." And he is, uhm, ah, author of a forthcoming book, "Therapeutic Approaches with African-American pop, Populations," with his, ah, brother, Dr. William Parham. What distinguishes this man, however, is his integrity, courage, and commitment to multiculturalism and social justice. This is exemplified in all aspects of his life and work. Dr. Parham has served as President of the National Association of Black Psychologists, ABPsy, and the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development. And just a personal story, there was a period in, uhm, no, this is not gonna be, ah, (laughs) the, the, ah, the hombres and that some people are saying, oh-oh. Uhm, uhm, I, I just wanted to, as an indication of, of what friendship, ah, really means, there was a period in, in my life several years ago where our family was going through a great hardship with the, ah, city, ah, police who, uhm, ah, arrested my son, I will talk about this some time in the future, ah, Dr. Parham and many of my friends, not only wrote letters, but Thomas actually called up the Mayor at his house. Ah, ah, and can you imagine someone having a, a, a dialogue with Doctor, ah, Thomas Parham, uhm, and so I'm forever grateful for that. The title of his address this morning is "Beyond Intolerance: Bridging the Gap Between Imposition and Acceptance." Ah, brothers and sisters, I think we are in for a treat this morning and I wanna be the first to say, "Amen, Thomas."

DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Take a moment to get mic up here. Good morning. 

00:03:00
 Good morning.

00:03:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  What a pleasure it is to be here and a privilege to address this body of scholars, practitioners, of people committed to multicultural counseling. Let me, first of all, say thank you to the organizers of the conference for both the invitation and honor to address you. And I want to really give a special note to the conveners of this conference. There's something curious about the sign of the time, particularly those of us who live in California. When we have given the nation, efforts like Proposition 187, which is clearly anti-Latino and Proposition 209, which is clearly anti-African and other people of color. With all the moon walking we've been doing backward on diversity issues, to see people move so much by the spirit and energy of a conference that they wanna bang down the door, scream at Derald and Lisa and Melba and Rosie about how come I can't get in, in 1999, just to be a part of a multicultural movement, there's some spirit moving in here, yeah? 

00:04:50
  All right. 

00:04:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM All right, That's, that's phenomenal for me. And I think that we have been rather polite in our applause, but I really would like to ask Lisa to stand, Rosie Bingham to stand, Melba Vasquez to stand, and Derald Sue to stand, as well as Dick Suinn, please, everybody up. We have not acknowledged them the way they should, give it up for these people. 

00:05:25

00:05:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Just gotta share a little love this morning. So, I wanna thank them really for their vision, for their perseverance and, and for their professionalism. Also, you, you honor and flatter me, both in introductions and, and people that I meet in the hall with some of the things that I have been blessed to do and contribute to the profession. But, one of things that I've been real clear about is that if I'm any good at what I do, I am only as good as the work that the people who work with me and for me can produce. In my management, in my assistant Vice-Chancellor, in my Director of the Counseling Center, in my academic instruction, I'm only as good as the people who I work with. And I take pride at, at being right down the road at the University of California in Irvine, at a Counseling Center that prides itself on being a leader and really operationalizing their commitment to training multicultural psychologists in the true spirit of multiculturalism. And so, while you flatter me, you don't understand it. I got a whole crew who works with me in a marvelous Counseling Center. So let me just invite my Counseling Center staff to stand up, if you would. These are the folk right, who make it possible for me to do what I do. Please, please. 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  We are a multiethnic group committed to multiethnic stuff, and what was amazing to me, we're walking in the hall. It was almost like somebody said, we should have had a reunion suite because if you count the number of people who have either graduated from UC Irvine, going to that Counseling Center, on some way been touched by folk in the Counseling Center, by, by a Godfather really, Joe White and other folk, it is pretty amazing, just, anybody who's been touched by that Irvine experience stand up for me real quick. Now, I just want you to watch this. You wanna know why we take pride in what we do? Look at this room, okay? 

00:07:45
[sil.] 

00:07:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And lastly, before beginning, I want to acknowledge really the mentors who made it possible for me to do what I do. I was a young man on the road to trying to be reasonably committed but not real focused, and it was a brother who stopped one day and said, "Young man, you have too much talent to be running around playing basketball and chasing women." True story. He put his arm around me, took me up to his office and he diagramed literally my whole future up on his chalkboard, and he said, "One day, you're gonna be a bad brother." He said, "But don't you ever forget to be a basic one." Right? It is that mentorship that we were talking about yesterday. And so my mentors who were in the house, I am very grateful, and I hope that what I do is always pleasing to them. It was Joe White at the University of California in Irvine, Forrest Mitchell at Washington University, and Janet Helms at Southern Illinois. These are the folk who make it possible for me to do what I do. Now, if we're gonna get into some psychology this morning, some multicultural psychology, let's get cultural. Now, with psychology, the books taught you that "psyche" was "mind" and "-ology" was knowledge or the study of and somehow, we translated that into the study of human behavior. But, if you go back into the ancient cometic(ph) world where psychology really started before it got distorted. Psychology was really about the study of the soul or the spirit. Our job as healers is to illuminate and liberate the spirit. And so, we're gonna try to illuminate and liberate that spirit this morning. So, let me see if we can't start off right with some ritual. Let me ask everybody in the house to stand up, if you would. Now, as you're standing, let me ask you to connect up the room, connect it up. Grab a hand. Hug an elbow. I wanna connect it up. We always ought to begin our psychological interventions with ritual. Ritual helps to center our consciousness on the task at hand. What is our task at hand as we celebrate this wonderful multicultural family? So close your eyes and focus with me and pay attention to the symbolism as we call it "standing in the river." Truly, in the flow of human development, our communities collectively are river. And we who call ourselves people of color, people of humanity are standing deep in its waters. And with amazing grace, we are beginning to recognize the ancient flow of human wisdom, as well as the indelible marks of human development. The rivers of our community speak to and through us. People of color, we must listen to the laughter and the pain and feel the sorrow and the strength of our rivers. People of color, we are standing in the river alone. We shall be swept away by its currents. United, we can know there're many rivers to cross. Individually, we shall drown in its depths. Combined, the river shall guide us to the higher ground. Singularly, we are halted by its torrid banks, but as one, that river shall carry us to a distant place. As one people, the river shall return us to the source. People of color, we are standing in the river, transformed and transforming. And while you're on your feet, just stay focused a second, feel that energy, feel that connected. Just that we can't get some spirit moving into this room. 

00:12:25

00:12:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Now, put your hands together for me. Here we go. Come on. Give some spirit. Give a little(ph) volume, Lisa. 

00:12:40

00:12:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  It's all right to move, it's all right. 

00:12:55

00:12:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  All right now just take up a sit, just keep it going. 

00:13:55

00:13:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  So, good morning. It's called ritual. Now, in the short period of time that I have left today, allow me to be very pointed in my remarks. Allow me to be very deliberate in my attempt to penetrate your consciousness because our topic today is a serious one. In an atmosphere when multicultural competence is the issue we celebrate, I'd like to appeal the both your professional side, but also your personal side, to take serious your commitment to being a competent service provider. Now, my characterization of this festive occasion is no accident. For indeed, we are here to celebrate, as Dr. Suinn said yesterday, " The gathering of the National Multicultural Counseling Summit." And to reaffirm ourselves as culturally different healers, doing good things for people in communities all across this country. Brothers and sisters, a celebration is a time for all involved to take stock and to reflect back on those things that we, as members of this profession, both psychology, counseling, education, wherever you come from today. What are we thankful for? Certainly, we are thankful for having a conference like this, yeah? You know we are. Where issues of multiculturalism are really given center stage, not kicked, you know, as, as an, a, a tangent or an afterthought. It's like one session in the stream, a kinda one chapter in a book. We center stage here this morning. Conferences like these, though, are more than just professional development. Why? Because they serve as places of refuge. When that roller coaster of, of academic and professional life seems out of control, we all know that we have a place where we can come to receive support, encouragement, nurturing, and an understanding ear. Are we thankful for that? 

00:16:20
 Yes. 

00:16:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Certainly, we're thankful for the intellectual stimulation and a professional validation we receive because too often, our attempts to conceptualize client distress or to articulate research problems from a culturally-centered reality are shunned, unsupported, otherwise characterized as trivial, anybody haven't been there? I know somebody know what I'm talking about. Now, while our professional reflections are focused on present and past accomplishments, a celebration, really, is also a time for all involved to renew their commitment to continue their effort and remember where we as a profession, and where we as a collective people need to go. And reflecting back on that long and glorious past, I remember with reverence the pioneers of multiculturalism who chartered the course we commit ourselves to everyday. What a marvelous forum yesterday, honoring women of color who've been pioneers. Martha Bernard, Carolyn Payton, Rico True, and in her spirit, Carolyn Atme(ph). But we also remember the pioneers like Francis Cecil Sumner, and Kenneth and Mamie Clark and some of the folk who have not left us, but are giants among our field. These folks have been laboring in the, in the fields long time. We remember them today. But, as we remember them and reflect on what it is that they have done, the question we ask ourselves is how do we give proper credit and recognition to the legacy that these pioneers have left. Should we read the latest book on multicultural counseling? Shall we break out a new multicultural summit t-shirt or a poster? Shall we watch a new videotape on multicultural counseling and then consider ourselves informed? Hhmm. Somehow, I think that our pioneers would be less than satisfied by those tributes. Understand this morning, that's to give proper credit and recognition to the ancestors and the pioneers in this field. We must do a better job of recommitting ourselves to the principles and practices on which the discipline was founded and not simply worship the personalities of the giants in this field. We worship personality too much. And so, as we begin to talk let me call on the creator and my ancestors to bear witness to my remarks and hopes that what they hear, through my words and utterances will reflect their way and they will be pleased. We are a collection of psychologists, and counselors, and educators and other mental health providers of different races, different ethnicities, different genders, different physical abilities, different sexual orientation, and different ages. We are not simply a social club where we come together every year. We are members of professional organizations that have been called by these ancestors and these pioneers in the field, as well as the people in our own communities, to be the caretakers of their minds, their souls, their spirits, and of the hearts of the generations that are still to come. It would appear to me that sometime we lose sight of that purpose. We lose sight of that goal that conferences like this. And we lose sight, I think, because too often, our participation in conferences, or our participation in, in, ah, organizations is a reaction to the personalities of the conference participants. How many of us look at the brochures and go, "Oh, let me see who's gonna be there," then I'll decide whether I'll come. Yes? We personality worship. And sadly, we embrace or react to the personalities of the leadership rather than the principles on which that leadership is based. Brothers and sisters, psychology professionals, personalities come and go but, principles and truth are like two Tootsie rolls, they last a long time. You gotta stay with principle and not personality. Now, our task today is to talk about going beyond intolerance. And so the question remains, how do we bridge this gap between imposition and acceptance? Now, it seems sensible to try to define really what that construct of intolerance is. Intolerance, my friends, is defined as active refusal, active refusal, to allow others to have or put into practice beliefs and by extension, behaviors that are different from one's own. Now, tolerance is much more than just a difference of opinion, less to be confused about that. Intolerance is much more than a mere disagreement. Intolerance is really an attitude. It is a way of being that says, " I don't like something, and I don't want you to like it either." And not only will I not support you, but I will fight you from implementing what you wanna do. Ladies and gentlemen, understand, intolerance is an active, not just a passive word, and that it implies active engagement in efforts that would prevent others from actualizing their thoughts and feelings and behaviors, and spirits, and ways that differ from our own, how many of us in here today have found the sentiment of intolerance alive and well in our own lives and institutions we inhabit? Yes? Where we at? Where we at? And clearly, intolerance, to me, cultivates imposition and that we seek to impose our will on others regardless of their receptivity to be influenced. I know somebody is having a picture of a client up in there somewhere. And it's important today to understand how intolerances manifest in our lives. How is intolerance practiced? My observation is leading me to believe that intolerance is manifested in the normative standards, created by certain segments of society which are forced upon the rest of us. And if we examine our own American society, and indeed, our disciplines of psychology and counseling and education, we find these normative standards abundant. As an African-American male, I grew up much like Mexicano/Latino, and Asian, and Native American, and poor White counterparts with a veil of imposition, which told me that my success in American, indeed, my very worth as a human being, was contingent upon my ability to assimilate my values and lifestyles and behaviors into what the dominant culture suggested was legitimate. And my experience was not unlike many young underrepresented people, who learned that that phrase, "I'm okay, you're okay." It's just a euphemism for looking like, acting like, talking like, and walking like are you American counterparts, yes? I know I'm speaking to somebody here this morning. What are we doing? Intolerance is practiced and the attitudes that convey a sentiment of difference sequels deficiency rather than difference sequel and mere different. We haven't learned to really respect differences yet. We got a long way to go. And what's interesting about that is that different sequels deficiency logic conceptualizes the world in those rigid dichotomies we see all the time every day, like best-worst, good-bad, superior-inferior, always, by the way describing positive characteristics to themselves and relegating others to a difference of positions of inferior status. Intolerance, is practiced in almost every arena of life, personal relationships, politics, religion, psychology, counseling, the environment, gender relations, everywhere. And sometimes, we don't tolerate opinions. Sometimes we don't tolerate different looks. Sometimes we don't tolerate different languages. Sometimes we don't tolerates different lifestyle choices. Sometimes we don't even tolerate different divisions and people who are part of the same association we, you know, got the practitioners talking to the scientists, and the, the clinical folk talking to the counseling folk, and who's more and who's less. Listen, it's all abundant. What is all that about? We gotta find a way to try and confront that now. As we turn our attention to examining factors that really promote this intolerance, I wanna invite you to consider this thought. The substance and foundation of intolerance cannot be revealed by examining the subjects of imposition. Let me say that again. The substance and foundation of intolerance cannot be revealed by examining the subjects of imposition. What are you saying Parham? Is that intolerance must be analyzed by examining the psyche of the imposer. We're always trying to figure out when Rodney King happens, how the black folks feel, right? When gay, lesbian folks get beat up in the streets, we try to go to get the community to say, well, how do you all feel about that, right? We try to always examine the psyche of the victim. We know enough about victim analysis. We don't know a dog one thing about the psyche of the imposer. That's where our psychology needs to be going nowadays. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And what am I saying, hear me well. That means that the pillars that's important, intolerance and intolerant attitudes are not just composed of the attitudes of the oppressed. They are reinforced by the hardened steel hearts and the concretized attitudes of the oppressor. You can't ask women how they feel about oppression, sexism is not a woman's problem, it's a man's problem. And man, we got to clean up our own house with that. We can't go around asking physically challenged people how they feel about being oppressed and discriminated against. Discrimination is not a problem for the physically challenged. It's a problem for the more able-bodied among us who are not sensitive enough to their needs, to modify the environment so that they can live happy, healthy, productive lives. That's our problem. Now, if we delve into that self, that is intolerant, that self that is rigid, that self that is inflexible, that self that is unyielding. I think we may find intolerance supported by several character traits. The first of these is the feeling of superiority. I know you don't know anybody like this but let me just describe them for you. Feeling of superiority or, or significance. The extreme of superiority is that feeling that deludes us into believing that somehow we are better than somebody else. So much so that we find ourselves unable to tolerate other people's perceived shortcomings, even when they are representatives and members of associations we all inhabit. And feelings of superiority, I think, give rise to attitudes of racism and sexism, and ageism, and religionism, and ethnocentrism, and homophobia, et cetera. Now, my theoretical training in my counseling clinical experiences as a practitioner have also taught me that usually, when I find an excessive feeling of superiority, some might even call it a neurotic feeling, that is often rooted in a deep-sitted sense inadequacy and inferiority. And so, my second character trait that I think supports attitudes of intolerance are feelings of inferiority. Somehow, we find our own inadequacies too distressing to deal with so we camouflage our own feelings by denigrating others in order to affirm ourselves. We degrade other human beings in an attempt to affirm our own humanity. Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow psychologists and healers, please understand that self-affirmation can never be contingent upon having to denigrate anybody, all right? Self-affirmation ought to be independent. My third character trait that supports intolerance is the meshing of ignorance and blindness, the meshing of ignorance and blindness; ignorance in our inability or refusal to learn new ideas, blindness in our inability to see beyond our current space, to a larger vision. Because we fail to expand our minds. We fail to wanna open up our hearts, to an experience something different. And the fourth character trait, which I think supports intolerance is that fear of loss, the fear of loss of space, loss of privilege, loss of position, loss of status. That fear that if we somehow support others, if we accept others, if we help others to actualize their potential. If we help them to grow as individuals, that somehow we will compromise or destroy the form and collective substance of our own experience. And the assumption here is that the rise of any group is tantamount to the destruction of another. Therefore, I've got to keep you down in order to protect myself. How irrational can fear get? We see this going on everyday. And what a shame that the fear of loosing yourself and others compels us to keep other people down. And sadly for all of us, we fail to recognize that allowing people to be who and what they wish to be, allowing them to engage in greater levels of self-affirmation and self-determination, supports and affirms our own humanity as people. What are we doing? When we deny the others the right to self-affirmation and self-determination, it robs us of the comfort to be who we want to be. And Maya Angelou really said it much better than I could, in her poem in 'Still I Rise'. Anybody heard it, right? You meant what she says in the first verse. Help me out now, "You may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies. You may trod me in the very dirt but still like air, I rise." Now, she concludes her poem by exclaiming, "You may shoot me with your words. You my cut me with your eyes, you may kill me with your hatefulness but still like air, I'll rise." What's Maya Angelou really saying for us? What is she really sending us a message about that we fail to pay attention to, I think, in our work? You ain't gonna find Maya in the psychology books by the way, yeah, right? What Maya is saying is that we have to recognize that the reaction that people have to intolerance, is not often independently initiated 'coz those of us in those kind of superior positions, kinda sit back and go, "What's wrong with them?" Yeah? Darn, you've got kinda a bad attitude today. Why you always got a chip on your shoulder? Why are you always complaining about Sundance? I know nobody hears that in here, yeah, right? And part of what's happening is that they fail to recognize that people who feel, right, that they are experiencing too much intolerance in their life, right? They don't just independently initiate it that is a reaction to being imposed upon. And what you got to understand, you got to understand that only if you disrespect my humanity will I rise in anger. And only if you disregard my needs will I rise in rebellion. And only if you perpetrate your evilness and wickedness on me, will I rise with a retaliation. Just take a look around the world. You ain't got to go far. Look at Africa, Russia, Central America, Bosnia, China, Korea, right here in the United States, in almost any city and community in America, and all psychological and counseling associations. And understand that only if you degrade my culture and history will I rise with the resolve to be myself in spite of you. Yeah? We must find a way to better respect each other's humanity, I think. And we, who proud ourselves on being psychologist and counselors and educators and healers, must lead that charge to regain that spear that has somehow gotten lost up in the wilderness someplace. And so to focus on multi-cultural competence brings us into several assumptions. What do we gotta do? The first assumption I make, be very clear about this, is that the wave of a movement that is composed of truth and righteousness cannot be shackled by institutional policies and procedures. Let me say that again. The wave of a movement that is composed of truth and righteousness cannot be shackled by institutional policies and procedures. What are you saying Parham? I'm saying that movements are bigger than people or institutional barriers. The underground-railroad was bigger than the chains of slavery, that's why I kept workin'. The civil rights struggle was bigger than the walls of segregation and the laws of Jim Crow, yeah? The black power movement and that marvelous militancy of the 60's and 70's was bigger than the shackles of self-denigration and institutional racism. And so understand in 1999 that the movement of multiculturalism is bigger than local state or national psycho-counseling associations. And those of us who are committed to this movement are not in need of institutional permission slips in order to allow us to assert our right to greater levels of multi-cultural competence. We don't need their permission. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Now, I say this because I wanna call on, on a particular example. Because those of use who've been trying to be out front with the multi-cultural folk and some of my, my, my brothers and sisters of color have gotten some correspondence from some of our psych associations. Now, just, just listen to this. Maybe it's me here 'coz I could be off this morning. This is around multi-cultural competencies. Picking on my brother Derald Sue by the way, right? He says, "I've recently seen the attached memorandum and document regarding the competencies, which division 17 and 45 have endorsed. In which the committee on ethnic affairs has also been asked to be reviewed. And the description of these documents and their content strongly imply that their intended would be regarded as guidelines, which provides strong encouragement and direction to the profession. Association rule whatever, whatever, specifies a very explicit process for the creation and approval of such documents by divisions. What does it say? You got to come to us to validate yourself. Now, it gets better. The purpose behind the rule is that the promulgation of guidelines can raise serious legal risk and consequences for APA and also for the individual members who create and promote them. Guidelines sometimes raise issues of liability under the anti-trust laws and raise issues of liability risk for those in the profession who do not comply with the guidelines. What they're saying is, if we put the guidelines out there and the rest of the profession is behind, they can be held liable. So they try to now tell us in the multi-cultural movement, "You better, you know, push the document down and put it back in committee so we can try to get it." And my advice to Derald was very simple. I said, "You send a letter to Mr. McCue(ph) legal counsel and say we don't have a problem, son. You got a problem with it. You've got a profession lagging behind this movement, the movement is bigger than your institutional walls or your legal document. We're on the move here. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And I, I respect process but you know what they do with process, right? They, they want to take something that that's just kinda out there and kinda stick it back in the committee, movement is bigger than that, right? We're not asking for no more institutional permission slips the wave of the future, all of you all here on bracing the fact that we need to be more multi-cultural competent. And if our professional associations are going to lag behind what it is that the spirit of the people say we need to do, our people out in these communities and these mental health centers and these counsel centers are suffering on the how it is that we have been trained to mistreat them, yes? 

00:37:40
 Yeah. 

00:37:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yes? 

00:37:40
 Oh, yeah. 

00:37:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And we can't just wait another twenty years on them to get right. So my suggestion would be, if you plan any of your foe getting sued, right? I'll put this wave and this movement up against your institutional guideline any day, any day. We committed? Yes? Now, the second assumption on multi-cultural, let me try to be quick here, is that the training for real professional competence cannot occur in a single course or by reading a single text. You with me? The real challenge in life, right, real challenges in life, do not discussed or resolved in 30 minutes or less without commercial interruption, right? Life doesn't work like that. You can't study for a minimum of five years to be a psychologist, to get a PhD, not even include licensing now, and expect to learn everything you wanna know about multi-cultural folk in one course, in one semester, with no practicum experience to support the didactic learning process. It don't work like that. And so, you got to go out and supplement, right, some of your work. If you've not read, right, Joe White's new text on 'Black Mini Merging,' if you've not read Janet Helms' and Diana Cook's new book, if you've not read Derald Sue's new edition of 'Counseling the Culturally Different.' If you don't have Ponterotto's book on, 'Handbook of Multicultural Counseling,' you can't just find a single source. You've got to read all of it. And you've got to step outside of psychology as well. We are not playing games here. We got to go serious study, and I just want you to equate it. I respect the process that said you got to study five year to be a psychologist, I think that will make you reasonably competent. But how are you gonna go out and work with folks of color in one course? And then they decide they want to be real (inaudible ) so we're gonna put the ethnic folk in, with the gender folk in, with the age folk in, with the sexual orientation folk in, with the disability folk, so that everybody gets a week in the semester and gonna pretend like he's supposed to be competent, somebody needs to be screaming about that. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Now, the third assumption I'll make about multi-cultural counseling and competence is that the commitment to true multiculturalism cannot be used as a fashion statement to dress up or camouflage insincerity and half-hearted compliance. Let me say that again. That a true commitment to multiculturalism cannot be used as a fashion statement to dress up or camouflage insincerity and half-hearted compliance. You can't talk about commitment to diversity and then act in ways that inhibit its progress. You can't express support for diverse ideas and professional roles and then conduct your personal affairs with scandalous inconsistency, right? You can't, I've read the other day in the National Psychologist, maybe you've read this too. They did a profile on the President, our colleague from California School of Professional Psychology. And I want to invite our President to consider that you can't be a President of a system of a professional school of psychology, right, can't be, like the California school which is one of our best in the country, that preaches of commitment to diversity and serving under represented populations, right, and then treat individuals like the CSPPLA chancellor the way you treated her and expect that we're gonna appreciate that diversity struggle, right? We can't do that. And understand here, if I am, if I am a student of color, thinking about California School of Professional Psychology, LA, for graduate study, or I'm a new faculty member out on the block looking for a position, and do I want to lend my skills and collective expertise to that institution, part of what I'm thinking to myself, CSPP is, if you can treat a star studded African-American woman chancellor like this with the credentials this sister has like you treated her, what would you do to me as a student and a faculty member, right? What would you do? All you're doing really is replicating that oldie but goodie tune. I think James Brown said it loud, you're talking loud and what? 

00:42:15
 Saying nothing. 

00:42:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Saying nothing, saying nothing. You can't make a commitment to true multiculturalism and use it as a fashion statement and dress up a camouflage, that sense of institutional insincerity don't work like that. My fourth assumption is that the standards of multi-cultural competence must move beyond simplistic yardsticks like desegregating professional associations and academic institutions, and institutional boards. The right to occupy the same geographical space has already been already been fought for and won, yeah, Rosa Parks set down forty plus years ago. We no longer want just a seat on the bus. What are we demanding, we wanna drive it. We wanna make decisions about where it stops and we want the right to determine if the bus will even route itself to your particular neighborhood. That's what we want. Real diversity multiculturalism is not about counting demographics. You can't consider yourself informed because you now have one woman on faculty because you used to have none or you now got two Blacks and one Latino when you used to have none. Desegregating your academic institutions or counseling centers or training programs or getting a couple of more students is a nice start but that is not sufficient. Culture is not about demographics, right? Real culture and real commitment to institutional diversity says, "Not do you have more people, but do the policies and practices of your institution changed as a function of the changes in your demographic makeup?" That's what I wanna know. That's what I wanna know. And the fifth assumption is that the gift of knowledge that we have been blessed to acquire in our professional training are not intended for our own personal gratification. I know we live in a society that judges us by the degrees we acquire, right? But it's different than that, people really is. It's important for us to recognize that the greatness of our gifts as healers and the proper purpose for which they intended is not about acquisition of material wealth and possession. The gifts we have been blessed to acquire really, right, are not intended to live large, right? To private practice or the fees we charge through manage care. Our gifts aren't intended to manipulate others in the hopes of easing our own circumstance, and our gifts were certainly not intended to make it easier to acquire material possession that we somehow think make us all of that. See, the Creator I worship and the principles of multiculturalism that I embrace remind us that those who are blessed with talent and degrees will not be judged on how important they seemed to the level of prominence they achieved in this profession. But rather, on how they use their gift to service our people, to service our community, and to service humanity in general. So you got to consider yourselves as psychologist and counselors and educators as servants. (cough) And as servants, you cannot serve your people properly, right, from elevated positions of arrogance and increased stature, despite what society tells you about your PhD's, you can't. And the higher up you go on that educational ladder to attain that social status, the more potential we have to get cut off from who we really are. We got to resurrect those spirits, kinda find who we really are that somehow has been lost, right, in this material attainment world. There's a fundamental difference, my friends, between what it is you do as a professional and who you are as people. And what our clients need is that personal you, not just that professional you. What our clients know, right, is what you've learned through personal struggle and services that allowed you to experience first-hand your truest self. Your truest self is not just in that PhD, that's part of your identity. Your truest self was that self that found the ability to persevere in the face of adversity, yeah? That self that found courage in the face of fear, that self that showed hope in the face of despair, that self that showed strength and discipline when that roller coaster of life seemed out of control. That self that showed compassion in the face of insensitivity, that self that still struggles for self determination in a world that would seek to control your mind, your bodies, and your spirits. We must be careful not to wrap ourselves in the splendor or our degrees, but rather we have to use our abilities and our gifts to assist and serve the broader community at large. Now, on focusing our attention back on the notion of intolerance, the question remains, how do we become more tolerant and flexible? If intolerance is supported by attitudes of superiority and feelings of inferiority, and the meshing of ignorance and blindness, and, and the fear of loss, how do we transform those? How do we move into more positive attributes? How do we bridge the gap between imposition and acceptance? Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the answer lies in our focus and search on self-awareness. There's no accident that that is really the first level of competence. We don't start with skill, we don't start with knowledge. We start with awareness, enlightenment, illumination of that spirit. Bridging the gap requires that we as professionals confront our own values rather than the values of others. We can't continue to ask for, why don't you change? What is wrong with you? Try turning your sights inward and asking ourself, what is it that I can do to change? What is it that keeps my attitudes and behaviors more imposing rather than accepting? What is it that compels me to rigidity rather flexibility? We got to go inward. Now, if you take away all those things, the feelings of superiority, inferiority, ignorance and blindness, right, and that fear of loss, you've got a big void. You've got a hole in there somewhere, and so we got to replace it. What do you replace it with? What are you gotta patch yourself up with? We got several things we can use. One, try patching yourself up with some courage. We need some courage to confront our own limitations, courage to risk public condemnation for our stance against intolerance. Try being a non-conformist. What's, what's, what's true, I think about Jack De Dovidio's research when he writes about racism among the well-intentioned, right, the ought not racists in the world, right? I learned this very, very clearly now, right? We are very good about kinda looking at our white brothers and sisters and saying racists. All white people are not racists. The ought not racists in the world, you know, the hood wearing card-carrying Klan member folk, right? era(ph) nation folk, maybe five percent, maybe there, about as inconvenient, right, as a flaunty(ph) elephants behind, right? That is not the problem. I don't worry about David Duke, I don't. I worry about the fifty-two percent of the people who voted for him, that's what I worry about, right, right? The problem is not that everybody is racist. The problem is that we don't have enough anti-racist, and anti-sexist, and anti-homophobic folk in our community who sit back in silence and watch, while that, right, small segment acts and operates and we fail to do anything about it. We got to show some courage here. What do you replace it with, right? In your faculty meetings, you got to be louder in a consistent voice for multiculturalism, yeah? You got to have some courage. Those who are licensed are otherwise credentialed. (cough) We got to begin the question, licensing boards and, and the ethics of certifying professionals, to practice with people of color that have little or no multi-cultural training or even competence. Somewhere I read that it was unethical to be able to practice on folk that you don't have confidence about. Somewhere I read that. Secondly, you gotta become risk takers. We have to engage in mental risk, the willingness to stretch our brains and enlighten our minds. We've gotta engage in verbal risk. The willingness to just say something unusual, even say something stupid. Wonder why our conversations on multicultural counseling, I'm looking forward to the difficult dialogue this afternoon. Why? Because you gotta be a risk taker to say something even if it might offend somebody because you never learn if you don't offend. But most people are good at being able to segment out, right, an offensive statement from your intent. And if they think your intent is honorable, they will gladly correct you in the spirit of love and brotherly humanity, right? Than just denigrate you because you said something stupid, right? Take a risk, and try to learn, a verbal risk, and also we gotta take a behavioral risk. We can't continue to just do stuff the way it's been done just because it's always been done that way. You gotta be able to step outside of the norm. That's what makes people exceptional. It's not that they're up here or greater, they got a zillion PhDs. Rosa Parks didn't have Ph.D. the first. Why was she unusual? Because she was willing to just sit down and say, "I ain't goin' for this no more." Right? That's that spirit that we're trying to capture, risk takers. Third, you gotta supplement and fortify our existing knowledge of different things with real experience. Most of what people of, of humanity in this country learn about folk or culturally different we learn off a TV and through the media. Yes? And those distorted images are not right. We gotta do something about that. You gotta encourage them and you yourselves gotta be able to meet somebody and talk with somebody. I know some of you say "But, Parham, I got faculty members who are black and brown and blue and purple, you know, in my department and in my council," whatever but you, all that is desegregation. You occupy the same space, but if we gave everybody here a chance to say, could you articulate three of the core values to somebody culturally different than you hold, could you pass it? 'Cause we're not spending no quality time around their kitchen table, we're not in their living rooms around the fire really talking about the central issues of our day. We're not in our staff meetings and really trying to engage those topics, right? Of critical discourse? We're just kinda occupying the same space. We gotta move to a different level than that. We gotta supplement it with real experience. And fourth, we gotta rediscover in ourselves the capacity to trust, and be reminded today, that real trust is not an external circumstance, but an internal virtue. You with me? Real trust is not an external circumstance, people. It is an internal virtue. You cannot pretend to trust folk, and then make everybody have to jump through a series of hoops in order to earn your trust, that's externalizing trust. Real trust is not an external circumstance, Parham believes, is an internal virtue. The question is not, "Can I trust you?" The question is, "Can I trust myself enough to take a risk with you?" That's where we got to go in this multi-cultural struggle. And finally, bridging the gap, requires that we renew our faith in progress, and trust in the process. Renew our faith in progress and trust in the process. What did Martin Luther King say, "How long? Not long, 'cause no lie can live forever." How long? Not long because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it always bends toward justice. We gotta trust, right? And have faith in progress and trust that process. And remember that the course of renewing our faith requires, not that we just have mere acknowledgement, it requires advocacy. We can't just acknowledge it and say, "Yeah, it makes sense." We gotta acknowledge it and then advocate on it by acting on that faith. We gotta be able to have strong behavior to put in place. In the shape of the world today, and our communities and our schools and our families and even our professional associations cannot afford the passivity on our part. We must become active participants in our own uplifting of both this profession, of both our lives, of our communities, of this nation. We are the ones who are trained to deal with these issues. We can no longer begin to sit in silence. We should not be looking at APA monitors every week, or every month when they come out, and not seeing the central issues of our times, really talking about how to cure some of the social ills of our life. It ain't just about science, right? It's also about practice and healing and helping, right? We gotta begin to demand that we do some of them. We can't continue to bathe in a pond of, of annual conference or ritual for three or four days a year, and then swim in a pool of contradiction, you have a 360 plus, right? We can't do that no more, right? And so what are we doin' about the social ills, right? What are we doin' about that? Racism is on the rise. What is our profession doin' about that? Drugs are too prevalent. What are we doin' about that, psychologists? Homeless people continue to struggle for dignity in the face of very tough times and they're rather been, being treated with dignity and respect and compassion in the face of those tough times, we treat them like tokens on a Monopoly board, sending them directly to jail without passing "Go" or collecting $200. Psychologists ought to be speaking on that pathology, yeah? That ain't the way to treat people and we all know better than that. We gotta be able to help our society rise to a different level. Women can too, ah, continue to receive less pay for equal work. What are we sayin' about that? Child abuse and neglect on the rise, transforming these childhood dreams into adult nightmares. What is our profession sayin' about that? Violence is becoming a norm for too many of our nation's children. What is our profession doin' about that? What are each of you doing? Not just as members of an association, but individually, to impact these issues? The time for collective action is now. We got to wake up, professionals. Psychological, education and counseling friends, ladies and gentlemen, courage to be a risk taker, wisdom born from real experience, the capacity to trust and the commitment to social change are what it is that we need to fill the void with.

DR. THOMAS PARHAM  As I close, I'm reminded that this time of year finds us concluding our Martin Luther King, Jr. celebrations, and moving into African History Month which I think it's appropriate that we access some of Dr. King's wisdom for this session. Lots of us believe Dr. King was a hero, yes? We worship his personality. How many folk have read his books, "Strength to Love?" "Letter from a Birmingham Jail?" Take a look around the room, we worship in personalities and not embracing principles. "Strength to Love" was a very important piece because I think Dr. King provided us with the formula for bridging this gap. Dr. King, as you remember, was a man whose goal was very simple. Eradicate injustice, achieve racial harmony, and treat each man and woman, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, right, with the dignity, respect that should be afforded to anybody in the human family. And King's formula was very simple. How do you bridge that gap between imposition and acceptance? You gotta combine a tough mind and a tender heart. We need a tough mind and a tender heart. A tough mind is characterized by incisive thinking, realistic appraisals, decisive judgments and a commitment to action. A tough mind sees through falsehoods of biases and assumptions to find truth, to find serious purpose, and to make a commitment to a cause. But a soft mind, a soft mind is plagued by irrational fear. It fears change and believes that security remains in the status quo because change is too unsettling, that's a soft mind. But King also reminded us that you gotta be balanced by a tender heart. Indeed, the African way teaches us that life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony. A tender heart appreciates true love and has compassion for others. A tender heart looks beyond, right, one's own comfort or superficial variables in an attempt to help someone or reach out to someone or connect with someone who might be different. But a hard heart rarely experiences the beauty of inter-ethnic friendship because he or she is too cold to feel affection, and too self-centered to share another's joy and sorrow. A hard heart is unmoved by the pains and afflictions of other people, why? Because they don't impact individual personal comfort and convenience. A hard heart is anchored in the past and blinded by the possibilities to the future. But a tender heart, a tender heart knows compassion. It knows other's pain. It feels other's sorrow and is compelled to exert some effort in order to make a difference in someone else's life. We must all have a tough mind and a tender heart. Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, there's little hope for us until we become tough-minded enough and tender-hearted enough to break loose from the shackles of oppression and intolerance and discrimination and apathy and prejudice, right? And ignorance, that is so pervasive in our profession and our society. The shape of the world today cannot afford soft-minded people, and as members of our profession, we have to be able to band together in the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood to try to make the difference to eradicate intolerance. And I'm reminded, in my 44 years on this planet, in my years of graduate and undergraduate training, that I've learned a lot. And as a psychologist, I know that in my counseling skills, I've gotta be sensitive enough to listen. Yeah? We learned that? Feeling enough to care, secure enough to confront inconsistencies that I hear out of my clients, and experienced enough to empathize. But my time on this planet has taught me and my cultural roots have also helped me to embrace a commitment that understands, that is, people committed to multiculturalism, and the advancement of humanity of everybody. We've gotta be bold enough to challenge inequality. We've gotta be brave enough to speak out against social injustice. We've gotta be visionary enough to believe that we can change our condition and modify this profession as people, if we put our collective energies forward. We've gotta be respectful enough to know that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and elders, and principled enough to be able to use our own cultural values as codes of conduct and standard of aspirations, and we've gotta be humble enough to know, that it's really not our skill but the creator's blessings that allow us to do what we do. Right? As I close, I'll leave you with two thoughts. An opportunity to make a difference, my friends, is a threat to those who only predict failure, but a challenge to those who think, we can win at this and we can transform this profession. If you think we can win, if you think we have the power to promote a greater level of respect for diversity and greater levels of multicultural competence in our profession in APA, in ACA and other places, in the communities across this country, then make a commitment to do something different. You think we can win? Who thinks we can win? Yeah? 

01:01:40
[sil.] 

01:01:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And lastly, I don't want grandiose change. My colleagues who convene in this conference and I, I'm not looking for you to go and just totally revolutionalize the world. Why? Because we know that sometime institutions seem so awesome it makes us shut down 'cause we don't know where to start it. We're too afraid to tackle it. So let me try to give you a simple formula. This is Parham's Formula, my gift to you. I don't want you to go out here thinking you gotta be a hundred percent better on 50 things, right? Let me break it down. Not a hundred percent better on 50. I wanna know if you can be five percent better on one dimension of competence and skill. Who can give me five percent? Now, if we add it up all the five percents in this room, we could literally transform the profession overnight. Not a hundred percent better on 50 things. Five percent better on one. An opportunity to make a difference in multicultural counseling is a threat if we only predict failure but a challenge if you think we can win. God bless you.

DR. DERALD WING SUE  Thank you brother(ph). Thank you. 

01:02:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It's all right. 

01:03:00
[sil.] 

01:03:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE  (inaudible ) absolutely... (crosstalk) 

01:03:08
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:03:08
DR. DERALD WING SUE even(ph) so. 

01:03:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, I'll keep it here. 

01:03:15
[sil.] 

01:03:15
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Did, ah, brother Thomas speak the truth for us this morning? (Laughs) Uhm, ah, I would like to take two questions, uhm, ah, this morning. We do have a town hall meeting in which, uhm, ah, some of you might want to make comments at that, uhm, uhm, particular time. 

01:03:50
[sil.] 

01:03:50
DR. JUDITH E. N. ALBINO  This is, ah, not so much a question as a comment that I feel compelled to make and I want to thank Dr. Parham. His, ah, his remarks have been moving. They've been eloquent. But I also feel that I must respond to something he said because I am that President of the California School of Professional Psychology whom he has vilified on this stage this morning. I need to say this because I believe in his heart he does not know, ah, me, he does not know the reasons for my actions, he does not understand what he has said and I listened to him carefully when he said, everyone who is White is not racist. And I know that that's true and I also want to tell you that every action that is taken that seems negative towards a person of color is not necessarily racist. And in the case of what he said about me, that's very much the fact. My actions have not been racist. Some of you may know that I, before coming to California, I was the President of the University of Colorado. I talk about these things infrequently but I want you to know that I lost my job at the University of Colorado. I was forced to resign in large part because of the stances and the positions I, that I took on behalf of people of color, faculty, students, staff at the university and because there were those who did not like the positions that I took. I insisted that one faculty member be promoted although his research was primarily focused on Latino women and their experience with cancer and that was judged not to be a fit topic for research at the University of Colorado. I took the part of students of color at the University of Colorado who wanted a place to voice their concerns and that was an unpopular stance for me to take. And finally, I supported the appointment of a football coach at the University of Colorado who was African American. I was opposed by the Board of Regents at that university and I was told that it would not happen. I took the responsibility for the fact that it did not happen because I could not persuade that board. I say these things only because I think it's unfair for you to be left with the impression that I, as a person, am defined by one act which is not understood, which is not well known and which will not be talked about because I feel very strongly that it's important to protect the privacy of the other individual who was involved in this situation. So, let me say that again and let me ask each and every one of you to remember that fact. Everyone who is White is not racist. Everyone who is involved in a disagreement with a person of color is not racist. There are other issues in the world. I would like to simply reach out to every one of you today and ask you, let's, let's, please let's try to get beyond to what we see on the surface. I know that you and I never had a chance to talk that you don't know what I was up against, that you don't know the issues that were involved. But I come to you here in understanding today and in love and I certainly expect to do not just my five percent but my 10 percent, my 100 percent, if I possibly can because I think that's what it takes. And I want you to know that the, the California School of Professional Psychology under my leadership will be absolutely and totally committed to ensure that we do the very best job possible of educating and of training psychologists to work in a multicultural world, that we believe that is the only way in which this will be a better world. I thank you very much for your time and attention. I'm sorry that I had to seize the microphone in this way but I do think it's important that that statement be made. Thank you very much. 

01:08:20
[sil.] 

01:08:20
DR. DERALD WING SUE  I wanna thank, ah, Dr. Judith Albino for the courage she showed in terms of coming up here and I want, ah, all of you to know and, ah, Dr. Albino as well, that we are very open to, and receptive to dialogue. Ah, I'd like to turn this over to Dr. ah, Parham if he has any comments ah, ah, at this point. 

01:08:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Well, I wanna thank you for the, the risk. That's, ah, both a risky thing to do and let me say that, what I'm a fan of, I think even in not knowing all the fact is understanding that there is a fundamental difference between desegregating institutional environments and true multiculturalism. And that content issues aside that have to be debated in board rooms, et cetera in private, there is a process dynamic that people of color pay attention to and that if you violate the process dynamic, that involves I think treating people with a level of respect and dignity accorded them, right? Other people pay attention to that. So I will accept the critique as I've often admitted in letters I've sent to you about not knowing all the facts but understand that I give voice to what I have heard from students and professionals around the country. This is not Parham talking. These are other people around the country talking that there is a concern about the way in which we treat our people and as we hold this sister up in high esteem, we wonder whether or not other folk would be similarly subjected to the process dynamics, irrespective of the content. There's a process here that we're talking about. So with that, let me leave that alone and take some other questions. Yeah? 

01:10:30
OSCAR CERVANTES  Yeah, I'm Oscar Cervantes and, uhm, unfortunately also I'm (inaudible ) I'm resigning because of what's happening there, so there's a lot of issues going on. Okay, but one of the my, ah, things that I feel that right now, I know that, uhm, we are really fighting for grants, uh, wherein, for the people to give us grants, hoping to give us grants and we had to fight against White supremacists to really push for multiculturalism in, throughout their programs in the professional universities in this country. And I feel like we're, now we are ready. We have the men and the woman power from all the way, from the president (inaudible ) all the way to the pattern(ph) of the students to make our own programs so we can have qualified and competent Board of Trustees, President, Chancellors, faculty and students and make a really true multicultural programs. 

01:11:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM All right. Thank you very much, Oscar. Other questions coming? 

01:11:40
[sil.] 

01:11:40
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Okay, ah, I'm sure that you can talk to, to ah, talk to Dr. Parham, uhm, during the break and everything. I would like to give him the Dalmas Taylor Award in honor of your pioneering leadership, scholarship and aggressive advocacy for the inclusion of persons of color in the central fabric of the mission of higher education and within the field of psychology. This goes to Dr. Thomas Parham. 

01:12:15
[sil.] 

01:12:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Thank you. Let me, ah, applaud all of you for really the recognition and thank you to, to Derald and the convenors for this honor and, and respect. I'll leave you with, ah, one piece. In the African tradition we have, ah, a group called the knowledge holders, the elders, the ancestors. And there's a saying that says, "Existence has a face on every side and every face teaches a lesson. Those who fully understand existence do not separate the faces from the lessons," say the knowledge holders. Don't just embrace the personalities, all right? Embrace the principles that the faces are really talking about. An opportunity, my friends, to make a difference is a threat if you only predict failure, but a challenge if you think we can win at this. God bless you. Thank you. 

01:13:35
[sil.] 

01:13:35
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Ah, let's take, we're shortening the break, if we could take a ten-minute break and reassemble here for the, uhm, ah, difficult dialogues.
