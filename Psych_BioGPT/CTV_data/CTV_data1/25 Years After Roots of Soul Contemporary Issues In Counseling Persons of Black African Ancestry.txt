DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  Good afternoon. I wanna humbly thank the Winter Roundtable for extending this invitation to me. Uhm, I, I can remember it wasn't too long ago when I, I felt like I couldn't pay for my abstract to get accepted here. And you know, years later, ah, a lot of hard work, uhm, those, those rejections and learning from those rejections paid off. And I'm honored to be here. Ah, I actually got the initial invitation to present here at the same day that, that my daughter, Makinda, was born. And, uhm, my, my wife is right here so I have ah, ah, two, two bits of good news the same day. Uhm, when I, when I got the invitation, ah, I, I, I felt it was the opportunity for me to create something that I could really put my heart into. Ah, and that's because, since I had already been ah, invited I knew I couldn't get rejected so I felt like, you know, I can, ah, extend the wits of my creativity ah, to put this together. About 25 years ago my father wrote a book called, Roots of Soul. And Roots of Soul is ah, a similar work in the field of counseling psychology. And ah, I remember when he first wrote it I was about 9 years old and ah, with, ah, with a chapter titles like, Rock Steady Baby. Ah, it was actually a hit in my elementary school even though a lot of us didn't know what it meant. Ah, but he, he wrote a passage in there to me ah, ah, that, that went something to the effect of, ah, "Son, years from now I'd like you to take this work to an, to the next level of scholarship," and, ah, I remember that. Unfortunately, I also don't have that book because I, I let someone, I let a young lady borrow it when I was in college and she never returned it. Ah, so, if any of you all run across it, please call me before you put in on eBay. But my father is as much a part of this presentation as I am. He helped a lot with the development of it and he was very honored of, to me in the Roundtable for including this in the, in the conference. Ah, he wasn't able to come today but I did get him to record a short introductory message in which I asks him to talk a little bit about the psychological and social climate ah, surrounding the initial release of the book and to talk a little bit about the field of, of, of counseling ah, four black people and where he would like to see he go in the future. So, I'll start this clip.

ROOTS Ivory Lee Toldson, Ed.D 

00:03:10
IVORY LEE TOLDSON  Hello. I'm Ivory Toldson, professor of Behavior Studies at Southern University. Ah, I'm a licensed psychologist, ah, practicing here in Baton Rouge. Ah, I'm also ah, co-author of a book, uhm, Roots of Soul, The Psychology of Black Expressiveness. Uhm, co-authored with a very dear ah, friend of mine, who is now deceased, ah, Alfred Pasteur. Uhm, because we did this undertaking over 25 years ago now. And, ah, it's really flattering to me to have it ah, as a presentation topic ah, at a forum that, that my son is presenting it. Uhm, it, it's just a little bit about the social and psychological ah, context stuff that was going on at the time Al and I were deliberating to write this book. Ah, we were just in, in, Roots of Soul discovers in 82, we, we did a basic research for this book over five year period, so, late 70s into early 80s. But we, we developed this urge out of things that was happening in the ah, late 60s and early 70s. And I think, those of you who sort of know that history will remember that it was the period where there is a, a real ah, heightening of, of, of black awareness and, and black consciousness. And there were many of us who were politically ah, embracing ah, Pan-Africanism. Ah, and, and it goes being trained on that era as, as a psychologist, ah, one of my frustration was that, that as I was developing what I thought and felt to be ah, a more coherent identity ah, in, in, in war, ah, elevated level of consciousness, ah, I felt in my field, ah, solve a mystery because there was no limit to, of any abundance that, that seemed to ah, speak to ah, where I was now beginning to understand and believe about ah, black culture and, and, and psychology of, of black people. And so, so it's out of this frustration that, that, ah, Al and I ah, would deliberate and talk about ah, the, the absence of a pedagogy a, a intervention and way of proceeding or way of delivering therapy to the African-American community that seem to have some grounding, some rooting in ah, the black ethos. And so it was out of these ah, sort of dialogue and liberations uhm, that we started asking question. Given the, the atrocities that, that our people had ah, ah, endured from slavery and the needs of ah, reconstruction period of the South and, and, all of the oppression and racism that we lived under, ah, we raised the question, how do we cope with that? How do we survive that? Because we felt that in the answer to that, we would discover some mechanisms that we could utilize to develop a dead culture, to develop a, a how-to, if you will, of intervening ah, with persons of African ancestry. And so with that in mind uhm, ah, having laid out of ah, data gathering of methods, we wound up, ah, getting a grant to, to travel, ah, ah, Caribbean island to ah, West Africa ah, to ah, Brazil and of course across the United States, ah, looking at ah, black folk life. Ah, capturing it through, through picture, from interviews, of who the, the, life forms. And, and made an effort to, to look at the threads that seem to join those different expressions ah, that were unique to us ah, through and out the world, no matter where we were. And so, it was, it was, in, in this ah, calling that, that we ah, believe we pull together the, the foundations for, ah, a pinnacle to which, which we express ah, in ah, Roots of Soul. Uhm, and, and, and, and so ah, coming back to that question that, that is driving us, you know, how did we survive? How did we uhm, get through what was done to us and still being done to us since as a, as a people we, we really ah, kinda fear therapist and, and, and we don't like ah, having to utilize as a resource ah, and so, so in the folk community. And what we finally got and put together is that we, we would heal through ah, our expressive forms, you know. We turn to our music ah, through our song, ah, our dance, our poetries, ah, our drawings, ah, ah, when we looked at those we would see ah, our souls being poured out. We would see the sufferings, the same kinds of things that we'd go on in talk therapy. We would see them represented in our pre-productions. And so, ah, our focus then became utilizing those productions in the therapeutic process. Ah, to give that process a bit more of, of, of a ah, familiarity to our bloodtale(ph). Ah, it's what I think even uhm, today ah, we were still lacking the, the tightly wound, ah, framework for, for, ah, a pedagogy of how to what went of ordinary black folks. Ah, and, and, and the, the issues of, of, of identities, ah, there's issue of, of living the fundamental to the black experience, ah, a concepts that we ah, tries to address in the book and, and, and still today uhm, ah, we think that there, there is urgency for the kind of ah, inflation, the kind of, of, of concepts that we ah, espoused ah, in Roots of Soul. So, I trust that, uhm, uhm, with further exploration that you'll do in, in your conference, ah, that you will join me in, in, in embracing this book and the concepts ah, that it portrays, have accomplished. 

00:11:30
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Forever, a short introductory clip of, can you all give my father a round of applause. Okay, now 25 years later, ah, the pioneer, the pioneering work of my father, Dr. Toldson, and many others ah, like him, uhm, where do we stand today? All of you all probably have your own impression of that. Ah, recently, ah, this year, ah, I published ah, a book chapter in Counseling Across Cultures of Peterson's book, ah, the sixth edition. And I, I wrote a chapter called Counseling Persons of Black African Ancestry. And that, the introductory paragraph of that chapter was- 

00:12:10
THE WAYS OF THE NONCOMITTAL COUNSELOR Envision a busy public mental health center servicing a poverty-stricken district in a major urban area... The Invisible Treatment Plan (Williams, 2005) 

00:12:10
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON - envision a busy public mental health center servicing a poverty-stricken district in a major urban area. Medicaid recipients, wards of the state, court order referrals and others requiring public welfare or scrutiny, comply with counselors who comply with compliance officers in a series of routine and spiritless encounters. Innovative counselors and inquisitive clients are perceived as insubordinate. Treatment plans are as mundane and recycled as informed consent forms they follow yet clients sign them with a blunted indifference. Expectations are low relapse and recidivism are high and the recipients are overwhelmingly represented by poor persons of Black-African ancestry. I wrote that because that's what I've observed in a lot of the settings in which I've worked. That's the climate and the culture and treatment of African-American particularly in the lower income urban settings. But I'll try to resist against it. The first section of that chapter was called, The Ways of the Noncomittal Client, because after talking to a lot of people of all ethnic backgrounds, about how they can work in situations like this, and then, including a lot self taught, there's almost this sense that we have to rebel a little bit against the status quo in order to do things that are in the best interest of our clients. Example, I work for a mental health facility as a Ph.D. student and I have my clients, young, young African-American children and adolescents, call me by the name Brother Ivory instead of Mr. Toldson. I felt like Mr. Toldson was a little cold and impersonal and since I was doing mobile therapy, actually working in their houses, ah, it's just wasn't sitting right with my spirit for them to call me, Mr. Toldson. So I thought about what my stepfather asking me to call him when he entered my life. And he asks to call him Brother Imari as oppose to Dr. Obadele. And so I have him call me Brother Ivory. And the clinical director told me that, that created a imposition, ah, a type of relationship that wasn't particularly healthy in this therapeutic exchange. And so we talked about that. We ah, debated it. And ah, I wanted to debate they continue to call me to brother. Uhm, other examples is people who feel compelled to tell their clients that the diagnosis on their treatment plan really doesn't mean anything. It's just a formality. It doesn't mean anything about your situation or about your potential as oppose to what we are taught to do which is to tell them that they have this diagnosis and this condition. And this condition is associated with this prognosis and you have this percent chance of surviving and this percent chance of being doomed. Ah, we know that a lot of the people that we work with will have a bitter taste in their mouth if we approach them that way. There are many examples of this non-committal counselor and the reason why non-committal counselors exists is because we are in a situation right now where a lot of our ethics, guidelines and classic therapeutic methods are teaching us to conduct our therapy in the way that's inconsistent with the, the, the natural growth with, of the people who we work with. Now, before I talked about therapeutic approaches, our, our uhm, ah, different concepts related to Roots of Soul to today,- 

00:15:55
History and Nomenclature The Proper Historical Context The Proper Global Context Proper Psychosocial Context 

00:15:55
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  -I want to talk a little bit about the history and nomenclature of African-Americans. Before we can really effectively work with African-Americans, there's a lot of retooling that we have to do of the way that we think about the life, conditions, and history of African-Americans. There's a, there's a type of shift that we have to make. Ah, the historical, the, the historical account of African-Americans particularly in the United States is filled with distortions, contradictions and lies, omissions, ah, all of you all can attest to that. Uhm, ah, a lot of, ah, a lot of attempts are made, this is February, Black History Month, a lot of attempts are made to sprinkle a little black history into the curriculum uhm, but I've always said, there's a very easy solutions of having truly multi-cultural inclusive education, that's just to tell the truth. Tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Ah, when you talk about the American Revolution, talk about the African-Americans who fought in American Revolution on both sides of the Revolution. Talk about the Black Loyalist, as, as well as those who fought on the side of the, the Americans. Uhm, don't talk about the, the Emancipation Proclamation as the, the, the only thing that, that freed the slaves. Also talk about the black people who escaped then into ah, Maroon colonies in Florida ah, who was, who, who was, who was trained or not really trained but hired by Spanish when they was in charge of Florida to protect the land. And they were highly militarized and they actually fought for their own freedom. So the first black people who were, who were emancipated by the state actually fought for their freedom not the ones that were free of so-called free by Abraham Lincoln. These are just two very small examples of a larger problem in our, in, in our education system that brings a lot of our clients to us at a natural disadvantage because they haven't been taught the true meaning of their history. Looking at things in the proper global context, African-Americans tend to have kind of a underdog mentality. Ah, we look at ourselves and define ourselves based on ah, White people. Uhm, White people has this economic standing, Black people have this economic standing. But if we look at African-Americans as a nation and compare them to other nations across the globe, we actually don't look that bad. You take every black person in the United States and you put them in the Ru, in the Ukaine, U, U, Ukraine, you've actually have an elite group of Black people with a lot of White people that have some social problems right now as they try to adapt from the end of the Soviet Union. So, when we looked at ourselves in the proper universal context, we don't have to think of ourselves as, this gloom and doom race in the United States. We can think of ourselves as a race that has the gross domestic production of about Russia and Brazil and so we are about powerful as nations that have a lot of status in this world. The proper psychosocial context, again we don't need to continue to define black people by strictly other races in the United States. Uhm, when we look at data that suggest that 50 percent of Black males are currently dropping out of high school and we only focus on those 50 percent dropout and we don't look at the 50 percent who actually succeed, what's going to tell us more about how to help those 50 per, 50 percent succeed? The White people who are currently graduating at a 75 percent rate or that other 50 percent who is growing up in some of those same communities but they are succeeding. So we can learn from them in order to, to apply it to our own lives. What I'm gonna to tell briefly about the psychological development of Black people, a lot this ah, comes from the, the chapter, counseling persons of Black African Ancestry. 

00:20:00
Expressions of African consciousness Myers-James, L. (1988) Pasteur & Toldson, 1982; I. L. Toldson & Toldson, 2001 Constantine, Myers, Kindaichi, & Moore, 2004 Cervantes & Parham, 2005 

00:20:00
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Uhm, Expressions of African culture, there's a lot of, a lot of sites, ah, a lot of, of, of similar works that I cited from, ah, when I crafted this section of, of, of the chapter. Ah, the Black people have a unique consciousness that is derived from a collective memory of that has its roots all the way back to Africa due to Transatlantic slave trade on into to day. A lot of, ah, a lot of uniquely defining characteristics of this is our psychomotor expression, ah, our spirituality, ah, our, our, our affinity for, ah, for communication, of oratory communication, rhythm, dance and different things like that. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in the therapeutic setting a little bit later. 

00:20:45
Resistance to racism and oppression THAT'S RACIST! "Alien-self" (Akbar,1991) "Cultural trauma" Posttraumatic slave syndrome (Leary, 2005) Invisibility syndrome (Boyd- Franklin, 2000) historical hostility (Vontress & Epp, 1997) 

00:20:45
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Uhm, resistance to racism and oppression, ah, is another defining, ah, characteristic of, of Black people. Uhm, there, there have been many authors who have posted it that us, having to deal with continue racism and oppression in the United States, contribute to a unique psychology among us they have both, ah, positive and sometimes challenging attributes to it. Ah, on the positive sense, it has given us systems of endurance that, that adds to a lot of the street smart that we might see in some of our youth. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:25
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  The kid didn't want to stop saying, "That's racist!" 

00:21:30
Adaptations to colonialism Cultural imposition of Colonialism 

00:21:30
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON The Adaptations to colonialism is another aspect that shapes our existence in the United States. Uhm, there is a cultural imposition that's associated with having to adapt to colonialism. Uhm, Black people in the United States have been, ah, have had equal rights under the law, uhm, for, since about the 1960s and ah, the, the fall of colonialism in, in, in, uhm, Africa, ah, started around the 1950s and ended around in 1970s. Ah, so, we, we, there's, there's been, ah, ah, a cultural interaction between us, ah, since, really since our, our existence and it still, still remains today. Now, there are certain systems of and there's ah, a fish out of water right there and you know, there, there are times that I felt like a fish out of water. Uhm, ah, one of those times was often when I went to Court with the kid that I haven't been seen for about, ah, four months on, ah, ah, ah, we have to go the Court or accordingly basis if they were in State custody. So we go the Court and this judge who has no background in mental health counseling, ah, social work or anything like that, ah, based on, ah, testimony that I gave for about 30 seconds, ah, defines the faith of that child, were they go back to their, their, their, ah, biological parent, whether they stay in a group home or, or what have you. Ah, I would rather see a counselor, a council of elders. I, I would rather see people like Farham and, and, ah, Dr. Constantine, uhm, of, mix some of these decisions and that might be more consistent with what we are used to, ah, but the, the American judicial system is actually a cultural imposition on Black people. Uhm, imagine I have been tenure based on your auditory performance and your ability to express yourself to your students. We are from a very expressive culture that were that is valued. Ah, but in American educational systems written words are given more value than verbal words and we also see that with SATs as opposed to, ah, having kids to recite, ah, an, an oratory lecture in order to be admitted into college. So, I say all that to say that we can't look at all of these adaptations to another culture as strictly an obligation on the part of Black people. Ah, we, we have to look at this in the context in which they are presented to us which is an imposition on our culture. Ah, certain things we don't adapt to because in our collective memory, we want something else. In my collective memory, I really want the counsel of elders as opposed to the judge that was making decisions, ah, on a lot of kids that I worked with. 

00:24:15
MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE 

00:24:15
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  Okay, I'm gonna talk a little bit about mental health as it relates to Black people. Uhm, in some of the, the studies that I looked at and I, I looked a lot of it, and, uhm, at, ah, ah, the Surgeon General's report and, ah, and a lot of other, other works from other authors, ah, that summarize some of the ways in which, ah, African-Americans tend to, ah, it tends to like their, their healing processes. 

00:24:45
Healing Practices and Experiences With Mental Health Treatment More likely to use prayer, faith, and spirituality to cope with personal difficulties. Persons of Black African ancestry are more likely to rely on family and friends to cope with personal difficulty. African Americans prefer counseling to drug therapy and are more likely to have concerns about the side effects, effectiveness, and addiction potential of medications. Almost 50% of African Americans are afraid of mental health services, compared to 20% of White Americans (U.S.DHHS, 2001). 43% of African Americans, compared to 5% of Whites, experienced racism in a treatment setting. 

00:24:45
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Ah, one of them is Black people tend to have more of a reverence for prayer, faith and spirituality to cope with personal difficulties. Ah, that's why a lot of Black people would rather go to a preacher, ah, rather than go to a, a psychologist. Ah, persons of Black African ancestry also re, re, re, re rely heavily on family members to cope with, with personal difficulties. And they prefer counseling to drug therapy, ah, this was, was seen in a lot of studies and they, overall, they tend to prefer a more naturalistic, ah, type of healing process. Now, the fact that a lot of the mental health systems as they are today is incompatible with the natural preferences for a lot of Black people, you have, you have about 50 percent of African-Americans reporting that they are actually afraid of mental health services compared to only 20 percent of White Americans and 43 percent of African-Americans say that they have experienced racism in a treatment setting. Now, some of the trends that we have today that, to me are getting a little bit dated and are inconsistent with a lot of the practices that were fought for, ah, in the '60s and advocated today- 

00:26:00
Conceptualizing Mental Health Problems TRADITIONAL - deductive assessment methods - assemble discrete and specific data (e.g., age, duration of problem, and scores on psychometric assessments) - determine the probability that a client has a particular problem and - predict associated behavioral outcomes. Nonlinear - assert that a client's potential is more important than her or his position, and - "possibility" is as real and material as probability. 

00:26:00
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON - one is the strict use of deductive assessment methods in order to make, make certain determinations. Ah, a lot of our trainings suggest that we should take, we should assemble discrete pieces of information like age, duration of problems or the standardize test and come up with some sort of prognosis, uhm, and, and, and, and, and that's, that's because we want to kinda predict a certain behavior outcome. Now, the problem with this is that it undermines the true potential of the people that we worked with. Ah, a nonlinear approach will assert that a client's potential is more important than his or her position and possibility is as real and material as possibility. Now, I've, I've written a lot of psychological evaluations and I was trained in one way of, of writing psychological evaluations and I'll be the first to admit, a lot of the psychological evaluations that I wrote early on under my training, uhm, would be pretty meaningless to me now. Uhm, one thing that, uhm, the, this, this characteristic of, of a lot of psychological evaluations out there is the vast majority of it is negative. It's a problem-finding mission, ah, you have the, you have the mental status checklist and the, the, the personal history checklist and all of it is a problem-finding mission. And, ah, I found that I was writing a 15-page report and everything was negative. And so then, as I started to think about it, they will, you know, maybe I need to add a line in here ah, that's positive. So I added that line and I was like, well now you have 15 pages of negative stuff and one line of positive. So, I increased it to a, ah, a paragraph and then I felt like if I increase it more than a paragraph, and it will get, it will get rejected by the people that have to reprove it to, to, to approve it. So, that's the kind of dilemma that we're up against and I'm glad to see some head(ph) and there a lot people were saying they mean it. You know, this a, uhm, Black presentation so I feel free to, ah, say it, if I need to. So what's the future of this? Ah, do we need 15 pages of positive and maybe ah, ah, a paragraph of the problems that we're looking at? I don't know. I don't know how, how radical we, we could be, ah, but I would like to see us, us trying. I think we're a long ways from that but those are the practice that were fought for over 25 years ago and we have it really put it in place up to this point. 

00:28:30
Therapeutic Properties of Black Expressiveness Black expressions Soothe through spiritual, visceral, emotional, and physical releases. Help clinicians formulate ideas that can constructively dissipate tension and irritability harnessed within individuals existing under conditions of oppression, economic deprivation, and discrimination. Reduces aggressive impulses that frequently find violent and destructive routes of expression. 

00:28:30
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Now, as far as, ah, therapeutic processes in Black expressiveness, a lot of this was developed as, ah, ah, as, as, uhm, self supporting work by my father and, and some of it by, by me also, ah, subsequent work two roots or so. Uhm, Black expression is a natural part of the healing process of Black people and that's one thing that roots or so emphasize. Uhm, when, when we can get Black people to express themselves and, ah, I say Black people but we know that people have many different ethnic groups will relate to this. Ah, one thing that, that, that we've, uhm, the, the, the, the election right now is very compelling how a lot of, ah, dynamics are playing now. But we see a certain style that Barrack Obama has with talking to people and he has talked to people in, you know, at places as white as Idaho, ah, and as black as, as Alabama and there's a certain emotional expressive feel-good message that he puts out and a lot of the candidates are, you know, encountering that right now, saying this all style, no substance and you know, you can agree or disagree or disagree. But, but the style is something that a lot of other candidates are picking up on. Ah, when I saw John McCain saying "I'm fired up people," I, I resent, "I'm fired up and I'm ready to go." Uhm, and I say, "Well, you know, he, he must like a little bit of that, that style." And I, and I also saw and then I looked at this stuff a lot, ah, but, uhm, Mitt Romney did a, a call on response recitation. You know, he, ah, the, the, the, the response was, ah, was we could do better. So, he would say something and he would answer on the (inaudible ) and say, "We could do better." And so, there, there's a, there's a, a, a healing effect or curative effect to getting people involved in what you do. In the therapeutic sense, when you can get people to express themselves and to channel this feelings of optimism, hope to know that the, the physical state there in right now doesn't have to be their future. That their imagination and their possibilities are as real and material to them as anything that's in their history are going on in their life, you get them, you get them a huge leap forward to utterly healing. So, express yourself, ah, you look at that picture, she looks like she feels good. That's how we want our clients to look and feel. We want them to express themselves, ah, groove in forward their cause. Other things that are unique about Black culture, characteristic of Black culture, uhm, again, not exclusively to Black culture, ah, but to, to unique aspects of people in general's healing process, ah,-

African Psycho-Philosophical Beliefs/Values1 All Things, All People, Share a Common Existence Group vs. Individual Identity The Village as the Family Status - Function of Age/Role Kin Relationships Obligatory and Prescribed Acceptance of Unseen Forces as Real and Deducible Self-Worth Intrinsic to Being Oneness of Being Spiritual vs. Material Belief System Myers-James, L. (1980). An Afrocentric world view: Introduction to an optimal psychology. Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt. 

00:31:30
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  -a kinship or connection to all of things. Interconnectedness, ah, group identity versus individual identity, ah, the village as a family, ah, oneness of being spirituality. All of these things, ah, as, as, as posited by, by Linda James Myers are things that are important for us to consider in the therapeutic concept. Uhm, I, I'll talk a little about the invisible aspects of the therapeutic process. 

00:32:00
African Psycho-philosophical Beliefs/Values2 The invisible aspects of being transcend and are more important than the physical body in the formation of the self concept. Without the psycho-spiritual cure [the recital of words of power] the medicinal cure is considered useless. The ancestors are instrumental in protecting the individual from harm and in restoring a sense of well-being when the individual's life has been touched with misfortune. (illegible text) 

00:32:00
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON When we work with our clients, its important for us not to focus on who we have but who we could have. Who is that person in the future? What we want most of the time only lies within our mind and our imagination, but if we focus on the material existence of who were working with, we may never achieve what we really want to achieve with that client. So, when, when, when we can use our imagination and our vision for that client to help them to buy into that vision, a vision of a new, ah, ah, a new them, a new me, a new you, then we, then, then we're taking a few steps forward in helping that client to overcome, ah, the, the transitions in their life, ah, reverence to, ah, the spiritual aspects of recovery. Uhm, now we, we know that, that when, when, when we do the, the, the medical double, double-blind, ah, trial exper, experiments, the placebo actually has a very high curative effect and a lot of times, the placebo is almost as equal as the actual drug itself. And that's because when people believe that they can overcome something, they tend to overcome it both mental and physical. So, none of this is necessarily something that's unique to Black people but when we use Black culture as a way to craft innovative therapeutic strategies, we get to tap in to some of these wisdom that, that we've already found. 

00:33:35
Depth of Feeling The use of positive emotional stimulation is a central to positive arousal of human beings Present clinical ideas, concepts, and skills in a context invigorated by emotion or feeling This then places thought and feeling in closer proximity Pasteur and Toldson (1982). Roots of Soul: The Psychology of Black Expressiveness, Doubleday, Garden City, NY. 

00:33:35
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  Depth of Feeling, Depth of Feeling, uhm, postive emotions, ah, human arousal is a very, very important part of the, the therapeutic process. Ah, when, when, when our clients feel good, you know, we can focus on the feeling. Ah, there's, there's a lot of kids and they, they, they come to therapy and they don't feel good about coming. What's the chances that will really affect change in these kids, if they don't feel good about coming, that should be the first therapeutic strategy, just helping them to feel good about themselves and about, ah, what their, what, what, what their possibilities are. 

00:34:15
Stylistic Behavioral Renderings It ain't what you do, it's the way you do it To have style is to gamble with ones image in terms of how others see you Colorful garments and adornments Engaging motor skills Oratorical charisma Pasteur and Toldson (1982). Roots of Soul: The Psychology of Black Expressiveness, Doubleday, Garden City, NY. 

00:34:15
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  Stylistic behavior and roots of soul they talk a lot about, about style and about African-Americans and they, ah, ah, like, like my father said in the beginning, uhm, they went all over the world to places like Brazil, West Africa, the, the Caribbean and right here in the United States and they saw that Black people had a unique reverence for style. And in the therapeutic sense, they look that style as a way for people to take risk. A lot of times when people were trying to transition into something else, they, they, they, they want to, they want to look different. And so, focusing on appearance and style and, and, and, and helping the client to define their selves through the way that they express their outward appear, ah, outward appearance is something that's consistent with, with Black culture. 

00:35:05
Poetic and Prosaic Vernacular Rhythm is the pulsation that animates African languages Rhyming Prolonging word sounds and accenting first syllables Nicknaming Riddles and proverbs Signifying Parody Humor Call and response and unison responding African linguistic infusions Onomatopoeia Whistling, yodeling, moaning, "hummin" 

00:35:05
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON  And these are few other aspects, uhm, all, all of these relate to, ah, oratory, rhythm, of, ah, how, ah, ah, unique to Black culture, of, the vernacular and the vocal expression is something that's, that's, that's very important. Ah, one thing that I always found to be, ah, very intriguing to me is some of the, the, the, the young kids that I worked with, ah, who were, ah, failing out of school and these are kids from, from a lot of, ah, ah, harsh environments, ah, but they couldn't do well in their schoolwork, they have problems with reading but yet, they can freestyle. You know, they can take a subject and they could just start rhyming about it. And it would come out fluent, it would come out intelligent, articulate and that's a, to me, that's a gift. But unfortunately, even though it's something that if they were able to get through college and get in to the real world, that's something that they could use to their advantage, but in the academic setting, it has no material value to them. So, a true God-giving gift that they have basically it has to, ah, just be something that's completely be valued. And so, I'm gonna skip to the end because I only have, ah, a little bit of time. I do wanna leave some, some time for questions. But, ah, just, just as a wrap up, some of the things that, that, that we talked about today and, and some of things that I wanna emphasize, ah, there are new trends that, that are developing and that need to be furthered in our profession in order for us to have a truly, ah, congruent mental health services for African-Americans.

TOWARD AUTHENTICITY IN COUNSELING PERSONS OF BLACK AFRICAN ANCESTRY Community-Based Treatment Group Therapy Rituals and Rites Social Justice and Advocacy Shift toward within group comparison Shift toward international comparisons Celebrate Black history Contextualize problems Build on strengths instead of focusing on deficits 

00:36:50
DR. IVORY A. TOLDSON Ah, community-based treatment where the therapist actually pulls up in the community as opposed to bringing people out their communities is something that's, that's been, that's seen as effective group therapy, ah, rites and rituals, uhm, ah, having people recite different things, having a ritual about what they do. Social justice and, and advocacy is something that I'm really be going. Ah, I'm also a Senior Research analyst for the Congregational Black Holocaust Foundation, so, ah, I, I, I do get pretty close to Capitol Hill and, and, and to, ah, a lot of the legislation that goes on. But one thing that happens is, are the, the infras, the infrastructure for our clients gets destroyed a lot of times because of a lot of decisions that are made that we're kind of oblivious to and as therapist, our role is just to pick the pieces and that's a role that a lot of us passively just identify with. We pick the pieces of, of, of a life that's been shattered because of failed policy and because of things that are not working in the best interest of our clients, ah, ah, ah, ah, a lot of you all have heard of the, the three trillion dollar bill that George Bush just recently, ah, put out there and I was happy to see that a lot of, a lot of programs that work with people like abused children, domestic violence, ah, in other community settings are coming out challenging this because what the bill does is it, it, it gives huge cuts to a lot of the programs that help the clients that we work with and it puts all of these money into war spending. So as therapist, we need to be on top of that. You know, we need to be raising our voice saying that we need this money to be fair. We need to, we needed not to go to people who are just producing weapons but we need, we need to go to the people that we work with so that we're not just picking up the pieces of people that you, that, that you have broken apart. Uhm, focusing on strengths instead of weaknesses, this is something that I emphasize to a lot of my students. Ah, I give visitation proposals where they're looking for these problems but in the same database, they have people who don't have the problems. So, I want, I want my students, and I want researchers to start looking at those kids that don't have the problem, especially when you're working with Black people. The, the literatures replete(ph) with studies that show all of these negative aspects of Black people but what about the positive aspects of Black people? Who can we learn from? Do we best learn from somebody who has a lot of problems or do we learn from people who have a success? So, we need to change the tone of our, our, our literature. So with that, I will conclude and I will say thank you and open up for a questions.

Persons of Black African ancestry are more likely to rely on family and friends to cope with personal difficulty. African Americans prefer counseling to drug therapy and are more likely to have concerns about the side effects, effectiveness, and addiction potential of medications. Almost 50% of African Americans are afraid of mental health services, compared to 20% of White Americans (U.S.DHHS, 2001). 43% of African Americans, compared to 5% of Whites, experienced racism in a treatment setting. Conceptualizing Mental Health Problems TRADITIONAL: - deductive assessment methods - assemble discrete and specific data (e.g., age, duration of problem, and scores on psychometric assessments) - determine the probability that a client has a particular problem and - predict associated behavioral outcomes. Nonlinear - assert that a client's potential is more important than her or his position, and - "possibility" is as real and material as probability. Therapeutic Properties of Black Expressiveness Black expressions Soothe through spiritual, visceral, emotional, and physical releases. Help clinicians formulate ideas that can constructively dissipate tension and irritability harnessed within individuals existing under conditions of oppression, economic deprivation, and discrimination. Reduces aggressive impulses that frequently find violent and destructive routes of expression. African Psycho-Philosophical Beliefs/Values1 All Things, All People, Share a Common Existence Group vs. Individual Identity The Village as the Family Status - Function of Age/Role Kin Relationships Obligatory and Prescribed Acceptance of Unseen Forces as Real and Deducible Self-Worth Intrinsic to Being Oneness of Being Spiritual vs. Material Belief System Myers-James, L. (1980). An Afrocentric world view: Introduction to an optimal psychology. Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt. African Psycho-philosophical Beliefs/Values2 The invisible aspects of being transcend and are more important than the physical body in the formation of the self concept. Without the psycho-spiritual cure [the recital of words of power] the medicinal cure is considered useless. The ancestors are instrumental in protecting the individual from harm and in restoring a sense of well-being when the individual's life has been touched with misfortune.
