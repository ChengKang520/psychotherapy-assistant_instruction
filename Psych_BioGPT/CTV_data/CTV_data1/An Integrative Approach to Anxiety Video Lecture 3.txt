CLIVE JONES In all of the variables that are associated with anxiety, probably, the one that stands out the most often when initially engaged with a client in counseling who is faced with anxiety, something that stands out quite significantly is the biological symptoms of anxiety. It can really be a distraction for clients. Uh, because physical or biological symptoms of anxiety can dominate so much uh, it can distract the client from uh, working through the issue significantly. And often, what happens is that the issue that causes the anxiety ends up becoming secondary as the biological symptoms of anxiety start to dominate. And, uh, with heart palpitations, losing breath, muscle tension, agitation, not being able to stay focused, all of these things can really start to distract. And, so, often, in the therapeutic process, the first step will often be, when working with someone who is highly, who has a high, high anxious response would be um, to help to ease his physical symptoms of that anxiety. And, so, in this case example where we've brought a client, Michelle, who is struggling to tell her story that uh, she's dealing with because the symptoms of anxiety, the biological aspects of anxiety continue to dominate. And, so, the counselor is working with Michelle um, once realizing that the biological symptoms are dominating the counselor then starts to work with Michelle to ease those physical symptoms in order to continue working on other aspects of those issues causing the anxiety. 

00:02:05
COUNSELOR Michelle, hi, how's it going? How's it going for you today? 

00:02:10
MICHELLE It's terrible, it's terrible absolutely, terrible. 

00:02:15
COUNSELOR Okay, tell me about what's happening? What's happening in your life now? 

00:02:20
MICHELLE My husband just told me he's having an affair with another man. And, he has been for six months. 

00:02:30
COUNSELOR Okay. 

00:02:30
MICHELLE He, he. 

00:02:35
COUNSELOR Okay. 

00:02:35
MICHELLE If feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. 

00:02:40
COUNSELOR Okay, you are not having a heart attack Michelle. 

00:02:40
MICHELLE I can't think properly. 

00:02:45
COUNSELOR Okay. You are having trouble breathing. 

00:02:45
MICHELLE I can't breathe. 

00:02:45
COUNSELOR You are having trouble breathing. 

00:02:45
MICHELLE Yeah. 

00:02:50
COUNSELOR Okay, so, okay, tell me, tell me go on please. 

00:02:50
MICHELLE He said he wanted to (inaudible ). How could he do that, 20 years doesn't mean nothing to him . Oh my god. 

00:03:10
COUNSELOR Okay, so, I can see you're, you're, you've got a problem , you, you. . . 

00:03:15
MICHELLE My chest is so tight. 

00:03:15
COUNSELOR . . . In your, in your chest. Okay, so, can we do some heaving breathing here Michelle? Let's do some deep breathing. In through your nose, in through your nose Michelle and out through your mouth, okay. Three deep breaths . Okay, how's it going? (inaudible ). 

00:03:36
MICHELLE It's so shocking. 

00:03:36
COUNSELOR Hold your hands together Michelle, that keeps your energy within you okay. You might move that into your lap Michelle, that's lovely. You know, please go on with your story, tell me , tell me about your story. 

00:03:50
MICHELLE It's with one of our neighbors, I cannot believe it, good friends and yeah, he's, six months. 

00:04:05
COUNSELOR Okay. 

00:04:05
MICHELLE Six months. 

00:04:05
COUNSELOR Okay, Michelle, calm down, deep breath , deep breath, lovely, good Michelle, that's good yeah. Let's stay calm while we're telling our story. Okay, let's stay calm. 

00:04:20
MICHELLE It gets me so angry every time I just think about it. 

00:04:20
COUNSELOR Of course, I can see your anger Michelle, yes. 

00:04:25
MICHELLE I can't believe he would do that to me 

00:04:35
COUNSELOR Can you drop your shoulders just a little so you're not so uptight and tense, Michelle . Just keep them-, that's it, lovely, feel that slow breathing in your stomach. That's lovely okay, that's better Michelle. Okay, good work, that's lovely. Now, okay, now, more , tell me more about your story Michelle. 

00:05:00
MICHELLE Well, the meeting a couple times a week behind my back, while I've been going to art class. I can't believe this. 

00:05:15
COUNSELOR Okay, um. 

00:05:15
MICHELLE I, I can't believe it, I can't believe he would do that to me. 

00:05:20
COUNSELOR Slow, slow 

00:05:20
MICHELLE How could he do that? 

00:05:25
COUNSELOR Okay, slow, slow, deep breaths, slowly, okay , okay. Now, you're feeling inside your body this calm . What's happening out there is out there okay , is out there. What's happening inside your body right now is calm and all is safe in your world inside this counseling room. Okay, okay, and breathe okay. Okay, Michelle, now, I can see you're getting very, very agitated. What I'd like you to do Michelle is relax okay, just, just stay seated. And what I going to do is, I am going to take you through your body . So, every area of your body is going to be relaxed separately, okay. First of all , I'd like you to lift your shoulders. Lift them right up so you're really, really angry but then just drop them as heavy as you can okay. And, lift those shoulders up again and drop them. Just drop them. Okay, now your hands, get those hands , Michelle, and tighten them really tighten fists right and now just drop them, open them, flop them into your lap okay, just drop them and let's lift them up again. Let's lift them really, really tightly really, angry really and then just drop them. And deep breathing and out as your doing that. Breathing out okay. And now your stomach Michelle, inside your tummy, hold it really tight and your chest really tight inside your tummy really tight and then just flop it let it out Michelle, let that tummy just flop out okay. And lean back in your seat, just relax. Get to laugh Michelle, this is great to laugh. Good on you. This is a real release of your stress, this is wonderful. Let it go because this is life. This happens. Okay, now, hold those legs tight, hold them really tight, tense them right up Michelle (inaudible ) on the ground okay. (inaudible) (crosstalk) alright, and then hold them tight and then just drop them. Just drop them Michelle, just let them flop out, just let it all flow out Michelle and just relax and deep breathe. And in, let it out. 

00:08:20
CLIVE JONES What you can see uh, up to this point, again, is the, the beginning of the approach to encouraging the client to focus on the breathing, to focus on relaxing muscles. You can still see that at this point the client is quite tense. Uh, the important thing is for the counselor is to model (ph) and to maintain a sense of calm while also showing restraint for the degree of anxiety that's shown physically in the client as well. Now, in the same section you'll see uh, the byproduct of persevering in encouraging the client to slow the breathing down and to go through the process of muscle relaxation as well. And, so, this next section is showing, you get a sense of the end product with that process. 

00:09:15
COUNSELOR Okay, Michelle, lean back . And slowly and relax . In through your nose and slowly out through your mouth . In through your nose and then slowly out through your nose again. And relax, and relax . That's good , relax , exhale . 

00:10:35
CLIVE JONES In looking at the three different components of the counseling process obviously, it's something that would take at least an hour. And depending on how anxious the client is and how easily or how difficult the client is fighting to, to ease those physical symptoms yeah . Depending on how much of a struggle it is for the client it could take a bit longer than an hour. Uh, but, ultimately, these three sections have shown uh, and try to give some example of how to work specifically on the biological symptoms that benefits those, those clear physical symptoms for related to anxiety manifest within the client. And, as you can see, when you see a beginning component, and then, at the very end, that the aim is to have the client in a physically relaxed state. Um, and then, from that relaxed state, they'll feel a lot safer and more comfortable to face those issues that are, that are stimulating that biological response in the first place.

An Integrative Approach to Anxiety 

00:11:35
Role Play 2 : 

00:11:35
A Focus on Cognitions 

00:11:50
CLIVE JONES In this particular case example coming up, we are looking at anxiety. Uh, the previous case example was looking at anxiety in the context of biological responses of that were dominating. And so, therefore, encouraging uh, a relaxed state within, within the body to breathing and muscle relaxation. In, in this one we are looking at anxiety in the context of the cognitions. Uh, and, also the relationship, the personal relationship with stress that's causing anxiety as well. In this first half of the case example uh, the counselor is encouraging the client to share uh, their, their beliefs and their attitudes and perspective on the issues causing the anxiety . And, if you, if you notice the, the thought processes that are going on in the client that are encouraging the anxiety. At this stage, the, the therapist isn't implementing any strategies apart from encouraging the client to share their stories and their anxieties. 

00:12:55
COUNSELOR Louise, how are you today? 

00:12:55
LOUISE Uh, um, not bad um, the main reason I've come to see you today is um, because I'm not, not coping at home . And, um, mainly because of my kids and the fact that I'm, I'm a bad mother. And, um, it causes me a, a lot of stress and just seems to be so, so easy for everybody else. Um, but, I just seem to screw up everything I do with them. And, everybody looks at my kids as being the worse kids. And, I've got two children, one's 3 and one's 5. And, when I had the first one everybody used to say that with other people's kids I was a natural. And then when I had my own he's was, he was a really quirky baby really, crying all the time, I couldn't settle him and I just never seem to be able to do the right thing. And then, when I had my second baby, there was still the thought that it might just be my son's temperament that was causing all the problems. And, now that my second child is growing up I can see exactly the same traits, I am having exactly the same problems so, it's not my children, it's me. And, to go and pick them up from kindie and just the class that my daughter goes to , I'm always, I, I'm just really scared about what the, the teachers and the carers are going to say because I know they'll, they'll done some things because of me . Because I've not taught them right, I've not treated them right and I just can't be a mother, I just wasn't built to be a mother. So, that's causing so much stress. I'm not sleeping at night, I'm not eating, I can't concentrate on my job because, I'm constantly thinking about what they are doing and then what the carers and the teachers are thinking of me. Because, I know everybody thinks I'm a bad mother. They look at my children and they say "oh, well those of them are like that so, it must be her." Um, and, I don't get much support from my husband. He just says that I'm a great mother which isn't true because, if I was a great mother my children wouldn't be like that. 

00:16:00
CLIVE JONES In this next part of the uh, case example, the therapist is going to move deeper into the cognitions of the thought line (ph) of the client in regards to those areas specifically encouraging the anxiety . So, as you'll notice the therapist working uh, they'll be encouraging through open ended questions um, the, the greater relation and expression of thought line (ph) particularly in regard to those things that are key areas of uh, anxiety. 

00:16:40
COUNSELOR Now, Louise, you, you mentioned before that you feel you're, you're a bad mother. 

00:16:40
LOUISE Yes, yes I'm. 

00:16:45
COUNSELOR What's happening, what, what's happening that uh, that you feel that you're a bad mother? 

00:16:50
LOUISE It's not just me that feels it, it's, I know it's everybody else, they don't say it. Um, but, they , it's the way they look at me in the playground when I go to pick the kids up. Um, I think if you met my kids and you probably wouldn't even want to speak to me um. 

00:17:15
COUNSELOR Can I jump in? How, how do they look at you? How do these people look at you? 

00:17:20
LOUISE While I'm walking and it's as if they are looking at me and saying "oh, there she is" you know , they are gossiping and wondering what I do you know, to the kids when I get home. Uh, they are just seeing them as annoying kids in the classroom . Um, I know what I would've thought if I was in that situation, seeing like the naughty kids in the class coming out. I'll be, I'll be thinking that their mother was horrendous. Uh, beating them at home and, and starving them, locking them in rooms . And, I don't do that but, my kids are the naughty kids so, what am I doing? 

00:18:10
COUNSELOR But, but, why, why do you think your children are the naughty kids? Why do you think your kids are naughty? 

00:18:15
LOUISE Because I've not brought them up properly. 

00:18:20
COUNSELOR What is it that, how is it that the way that you've brought your children up that you feel is not properly? What do you think you've done in the way you've brought up your children? 

00:18:35
LOUISE I don't know. Maybe, maybe because I've had to go out and work I've not spent enough time with them. But, then I see, I see other moms who do work and their kids are perfect . Their kids always like do what they are told. They don't muck up in class. They don't mess around. They don't get into little scrats (ph) in the playground. And that tells me that I'm a bad mother because other parents seem to have this maternal instinct that, that let's the children get on with them and let's them identify with their children and I, I can't. 

00:19:15
COUNSELOR But, what is it that your children do that's so bad? 

00:19:20
LOUISE Well, if I ask them to do something in the house they will, if I ask them to go to the room they won't do it. 

00:19:30
COUNSELOR And, you don't think that in any other families where they've got their children and they are not getting into scrats (ph) in the schoolyard that their children always do the right think when they are told? 

00:19:40
LOUISE Nobody seems to have as much trouble as me. Nobody seems to worry about it, they'll, they'll stand there in their little social circle and they just go on about how great their kids are and my little ones are always being shouted out and put in the corner and that just reflects so badly on me. Because at that age they are the products of what the parents made them and that means I made them like that. 

00:20:15
COUNSELOR Louise, are they always (inaudible ) of being naughty each day? Does this happen every day? 

00:20:20
LOUISE Most, most days . But, it's not, they are not the only ones that get shouted at but most of the time, yeah. 

00:20:30
COUNSELOR Some other children get shouted out too? 

00:20:35
LOUISE Yes. 

00:20:40
COUNSELOR What sort of things do your children do? What are the behaviors that your children do that they get you into that form? 

00:20:45
LOUISE They don't do the work or they don't tidy up after themselves in class. My son decides to start biting kids for no reason. My son doesn't do the little bits of work he's asked to do. And trying to get they give him little bits of homework and I can't get him to do them at home. He just runs off. He just runs and then if I try and make him sit down, which I hate doing then he just screams and then I just think "oh my god the neighbors are going to hear." I just think they'll think that I'm being really awful to him. And all I'm trying to do is make him sit down and do his bits of homework. It'll only be like five minutes but it's just so stressful that I can't cope with it and it just reinforces everybody thinking that I'm a bad mother because I can't even make him, I can't even make a 5 year old sit down and do like practice writing his letters. 

00:21:45
COUNSELOR Do you know the neighbors are hearing you? 

00:21:50
LOUISE I scream so loud. 

00:21:50
COUNSELOR They, they actually might not hear you . Is there a possibility that they might not hear you? 

00:22:00
LOUISE Maybe. 

00:22:00
COUNSELOR And, is it every day he won't do his homework for you? 

00:22:10
LOUISE Yeah, just, just some drama every day. Whether it's homework or just him picking up one thing in his room or anything that I ask, anything that I ask him to do. 

00:22:25
COUNSELOR I guess, I, I don't understand yet, why this is making you a bad mom? 

00:22:30
LOUISE Because other moms can do it. Other moms can do this stuff and I can't. So, that means there's something wrong with me. 

00:22:40
CLIVE JONES The final section of this case example of anxiety in relation to cognitions is looking at the, grief framing process. The grief framing and encouraging the client to reassess the validity and the accuracy of her beliefs and her attitudes uh, in regard to the issues causing anxiety. And you'll notice the shift in the emotional state of the client as they start to reassess uh, their beliefs systems and attitudes in regard to those issues with the children. And, you'll find that the anxiety eases as the cognition starts to change in a more accurate and (inaudible ) way. 

00:23:30
COUNSELOR So, Louise, just in listening to you, you were saying that you know, the children that that they're (inaudible ) every day. And that all the other mothers you know, don't accept your and that they're thinking negative thoughts about you. And you are really concerned about what the neighbors are thinking when they hear you screaming at the kids. Louise, does, do your children, do they play-up (ph) every day? When you think about it, after school Monday to Friday? Is it every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, every day? 

00:24:05
LOUISE To be fair, probably not every single day. I think just because it's so stressful that it seems like it's every day. 

00:24:20
COUNSELOR Yes. 

00:24:20
LOUISE But, it just seems to happen to me more than other people. 

00:24:25
COUNSELOR Exactly, it seems to happen to you more . What about some of the other mothers, do, do they, do any of them, do they say good morning or a bit of a word? 

00:24:40
LOUISE They are a couple but, I always think that they are just doing it to be polite and are not really um, they don't really mean it, they don't really want to talk to me. 

00:24:55
COUNSELOR Because you are the worse mother in the world? 

00:25:00
LOUISE Yeah. 

00:25:05
COUNSELOR Do you really think you are the worse mother in the world? What are some good things you do for your children ? What happy moments do you have with the children? 

00:25:15
LOUISE On the weekends, I uh, take them to the park. Um, they, they just go wild. 

00:25:30
COUNSELOR Yes, they enjoy that? 

00:25:30
LOUISE Yeah. 

00:25:35
COUNSELOR That, that play-up (ph)? 

00:25:35
LOUISE No, no they just have a good (inaudible ) to be honest I just sit there and watch them go. Um, I am, I take, I take my youngest to um, to gymnastics and she's only just starting out but she, she loves it. She's always running up to me and tells me what she's done. 

00:25:55
COUNSELOR And then, how do you feel as a mom when she tells you? 

00:26:00
LOUISE She looks so uncoordinated but, she's doing a good job. I feel quite proud. 

00:26:10
COUNSELOR Yes, exactly and you feel quite proud. So, she's doing well there and you are supporting her there. 

00:26:15
LOUISE Yeah. 

00:26:20
COUNSELOR So, there are moments there when you enjoy your children? 

00:26:20
LOUISE Oh, yeah, I mean. 

00:26:25
COUNSELOR Are there moments? 

00:26:25
LOUISE Yeah, there are quite a few moments. I think that I'm overwhelmed because the stressful times I find that, I just find so overwhelming. Um, I kinda just loose it and forget about all the nice things you do together, they just kinda go out the window. 

00:26:50
COUNSELOR And, in those enjoyable moments especially, when you are proud of your children, do you feel a bit like you know, how do you feel as, as a mother? Do you feel like a good mother? 

00:27:00
LOUISE Yeah, I kinda wish all the other moms were around at those points so they could see me as that mom. Um, and also you know, we have our bedtime routine and they just, yeah, they stick to their bedtime routine really well. 

00:27:20
COUNSELOR (inaudible ). 

00:27:21
LOUISE You know, that's something that we just come together , like our little quality time together. 

00:27:30
COUNSELOR And you have (inaudible )? 

00:27:32
LOUISE Yeah, I knew I wasn't going to get any sleep which would be the worse. 

00:27:35
COUNSELOR Cuz it's (inaudible ). So, there's some really good stuff there happening with you and your children and happy moments. Something there must be saying that you are a good mom at least , in those moments. So, you are not all bad as a mother. And so, then, do you think that some of your friends you know, the ones who wave to you when you are taking your kids to school, do you think maybe that sometimes they might have moments with their kids you know, when their kids play-up (ph) do they feel (inaudible )? 

00:28:20
LOUISE Yeah, I suppose I, I suppose all kids must play with it sometimes it's just that I never , I think I'm so focused on my kids and how that, what that means about me. That I, I probably couldn't even tell which child belongs to which parent because I'm so focused on my own kids. 

00:28:40
COUNSELOR Maybe your children do play-up (ph), what is it about that, that labels you as a bad mother? When you see other kids playing-up (ph) do you think immediately (inaudible ) do you think that? 

00:28:55
LOUISE No, the, the, I think the other mothers just seem to have these skills that can, that can just seem to calm their children down and make them behave. Whereas, I feel as though just going in there blind and just do whatever come in my head. 

00:29:20
COUNSELOR You don't think the other mothers might be just doing whatever comes into their head at times. 

00:29:25
LOUISE Yeah, probably yeah.
