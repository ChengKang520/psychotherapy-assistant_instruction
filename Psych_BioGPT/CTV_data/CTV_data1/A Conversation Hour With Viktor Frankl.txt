Conversation Hour: Viktor Franki, MD 

00:00:00
LANCE ERICKSON As Jeff said, my name is Lance Erickson (ph) and I have the great privilege of moderating this conversation hour with Dr. Frankl. We are all highly honored to have Dr. Frankl and his wife Ellie here at this conference. Dr. Frankl is a great humanist. His writings and his life testify to that. I would like to paraphrase my wife in describing him just a second and say that his life, his understanding of life, his articulation of life are the essence of being. I think that's a very apt description. I would like to, since it's conversation hour, uh, I don't know whether Dr. Frankl would like to say anything at the beginning or just take questions. 

00:02:05
VIKTOR FRANKL I'm ready to take questions. 

00:02:10
LANCE ERICKSON He is ready to take questions. 

00:02:10
VIKTOR FRANKL Because you should not forget that I'm here for you and you for me. And so I have to try to meet your interest and, if you ask questions, I can, uh, assume that, uh, they are, uh, perhaps meeting your interest. However, if I impose anything on you, then it might, uh, bypass your interests. I, I wonder if you, you could understand what I intended to say. 

00:02:40
LANCE ERICKSON I think they understood very well. I would ask that you speak into the microphones, that you use those in the aisles so that everyone will be able to hear your questions. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN It's not working. Yes it is. Good. Um, I was, uh, born to two survivors of World War II and the, uh, my childhood and, uh, the inheritance was that of being a victim and that, that of, uh, despair that comes from being victimized. I've read your book many, many years ago and got a glimpse of hope from your book but I didn't quite understand it until today, until I think I understood that what you said and that the meaning that you found had to do with a point of choice in a moment, that what you define for yourself inside was that you had that capacity and that ability, no matter what else was going on externally, to make that choice. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. 

00:04:05
VIKTOR FRANKL First of all, uh, what do you, what kind of choice do you refer to? Choice between what alternatives? Could you kindly explain this? 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Um, it seems like there, the choice, in the absence of choice, one sinks into a form of despair. It's a form, uh, of identification with that, with the trouble or the misfortune. 

00:04:40
VIKTOR FRANKL Now I understand what you mean and, and my answer could really be very short. Uh, if more, I could, uh, would have just to repeat something. A pertinent statement at least which has been laid down in in the book Man's Search for Meaning. Uh, this statement is not an oversimplification of, uh, what I believe it in but it is rather as simple as the truth always is and this is that. If you're in a situation where you have no freedom at all and including freedom of choice, the freedom of decision, you always, in any human being, always retains up to the last moment of his life, up to the last breath of his life, retains the freedom to chose the attitude toward this tragic situation. In other words, uh, by, uh, what attitude I adopt toward a tragic situation may well, uh, save (inaudible ) spare me, uh, despair because despair is always due to the absolutization of values. So if I think, for instance, if I were a woman and I think the absolute value of a woman, the absolute meaning, the unique meaning, the ultimate meaning of a woman's existence lies in procreating, life will and, uh, growing children, then I fall into despair if I, it turns out that I am, uh, infertile, that I am not, uh, able to, uh, to, uh, have children because my (inaudible ). Then I despair because I have absolutized the value of procreation but if I'm aware that life is so full of potential meanings, meaning potentials to actualize that this is just one among, uh, a multitude of potential meanings. Then I need not despair. I can see a meaning, find a meaning, fulfill a meaning in helping others. For instance, in setting up a group of woman who are, who have no children, can never get children and find in a common, uh, effort, find meaning in life in spite of all that. Did I make myself understood? So meaning's always available under any conditions. The potential meaningfulness of life, in other words, is an unconditional one. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Why do you, um, still live in Vienna? 

00:08:00
VIKTOR FRANKL That's your question? 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:05
VIKTOR FRANKL Why not? 

00:08:20
[sil.] 

00:08:20
LANCE ERICKSON Question here, please. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, um, at the end of your talk today, um, you said, if I have it correctly, believing is not not knowing. Believing means thinking plus the existentiality of the thinker. I would like to, um, I don't understand it yet. I would like it if you could say more about that. 

00:08:50
VIKTOR FRANKL Um, since I made this utterance, I feel, I felt deeply guilty because I was trying to communicate something but I should have known that it's not communicatable, uh, in a short, uh, in a short, in short words. Now what I meant is the following: I said believing is not some sort of thinking minus the reality of what I was thinking of. But it is some sort of thinking plus something. It is plus the existentiality of the thinker. Now I'm going to visit, this is a clear statement but it is not yet understandable unless I try to, to exemplify it. In school, in Vienna, in the, uh, tenth of the century, is it correct, 10? 19, uh, 18, 16, and so, we always use to say to attack someone among ourselves by saying believing means not knowing and not knowing means to be an, an (inaudible ). Huh? 

00:10:21
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:10:24
VIKTOR FRANKL No, no. An (inaudible ) means, uh, that, uh, that, uh, something like a, a small horse which is very... 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Agnostic. 

00:10:35
VIKTOR FRANKL No. Yeah, yeah, a mule. Tell them. 

00:10:40
LANCE ERICKSON A mule or a jackass perhaps. 

00:10:45
VIKTOR FRANKL But this is not true. You see, it's not just lack of knowing, it's something more because I, uh, I hinted to this fact. A human was (inaudible ) Pascal, great philosopher of the 18th? 18th century, yeah. And he, uh, spoke of, uh, 50 to 50. It's possible that God exists but it's as well possible that God does not exist because, and this, uh, is something most, uh, most theologians of today, uh, are consent, that there's no proof. You see, the proof of the existence of God. It's reserved to believing in God. Now, if the alternatives are of equal weight, that is why I spoke of scales, remember? Then I cannot by, by, by discursive thinking as it is called in philosophy, by rationally, rational, uh, concepts, I cannot decide what is true. Does God exist or not? But you need not speak of God. You may say as well some ultimate meaning. You remember the curve, you see the sinus curve. If there is a meaning, we can't know on the plane, on the two dimensional plane understand or guess, not even guess. So we are, we are left to, uh, what is left is to believe that. Now if there is 50 to 50, the possibility or the probability, I can only try to put my whole existence into one scale. That is to say, to say one option is possible, reasonable as no, no more or less than the other one but now I come up with a decision. If both, uh, levels, uh, or both case are standing on the equal level, the same height, then I make a decision. I wish that it be that way. That is, I put myself, my existence, my emotion, my, my, the depth of my heart, whatever I, whatever I will, whatever I intend to the world, to a push, put it there in one scale, uh, in favor of an ultimate meaning, whatever I cannot get, get hold in by mere rational, uh, means but by existential means that on an existential way. That is to say I stand for it. I say amen. Amen means it be that way. It should be that way. I wish out of the depth of my heart if I have to decide is there ultimate absolute meaninglessness in the world or is there an ultimate meaning that is so rich that I cannot grasp it any longer because I, I'm a human being who in all its, uh, its finiteness, in all the finiteness of his, uh, uh, intellectual capacities. Then I need not resign but I, I may always say this is my wish from the depth of my heart. This is, my whole existence is permeated by my belief there should be an ultimate meaning, along I can get hold of it in rational terms. And now what comes to mind, uh, comes to mind is something I would like to give you on your way. A wonderful, simple sentence I had, uh, come across in the book, uh, by Francis, a novel by Francis Garfield (ph). The, uh, um, (inaudible ). I think it was in, uh, one of famous, uh, novels. Anyway, whoever stated thirst is the most secure, surest, most secure proof of the existence of something like water. Do you follow? There could not be, it's inconceivable that nature has planted into ourselves thirst, the drive, the instinct of thirst unless there were water which compels me to search for thirst and no it comes to mind man's search for meaning. Unless there existed any meaning, ultimate meaning, rationally no longer conceive of meaning, how could you imagine that what I call will to meaning is so much rooted in the existence of any human being? So we may conclude from the I hope you understood what I, the point I wanted to make so that, uh, your applause is not just a misunderstanding of it. 

00:16:20
LANCE ERICKSON I think they understood very well. Question over here please. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, I have a question about your friend Martin Hideger (ph). I understand that he was, at one time, a member of the Nazi party. Could you give us any information about his reasons for doing so? 

00:16:40
VIKTOR FRANKL (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. He was a member of the National Socialist Party. Absolutely right. He became a member in 1933, when, uh, Hitler, in Germany, not yet in Austria, took over. Now, I wonder if you, uh, agree with my statement that he, uh, was a genius in his field at least, philosophy. Anyway, he was regarded to be a genius, even a genius in philosophy, uh, like nobody was since the times of, uh, Aristotle and (inaudible ). Anyway, however it may be, let's take it for granted he was a genius. Why should each human being be allowed, in his life, to make mistakes? Why should even each human being be allowed to make, uh, mistakes in the political arena? And why should a genius not be allowed this privilege to make sometimes mistakes? You are fully entitled, now, to say okay but then sooner or later, he should confess that it was a mistake that he had made, you follow? It was a mistake. Why doesn't he also publicly demonstrate that he had made a mistake? Now Martin Hidger, after one year having been a member of the National Socialist Party, canceled his membership, demonstratively, ostentatively. As Director of the University, I think, of Berlin at the time, publicly demonstrated his being disgusted, his being disappointed by the National Socialist Party and by Hitler, what he did, Hitler. What can you demand more of a human being than to regret it, to publicly confess it and then to demonstrate, uh, uh, his, uh, his intellectual, uh, uh, incapacity. Why not? 

00:18:55
LANCE ERICKSON Question back there please. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. First let me say, uh, Professor Frankl, I feel very honored to be able to address you here. I have great respect for your intellect and courage and I think this is a very blessed moment for me. Over the years, uh, I have been very disturbed by, uh, friends and acquaintances, both Jews and Gentiles that, uh, very, in a well wishing, well thoughtful way, have said to me, uh, why bring up this Holocaust business over and over again? Why not forget? Why not allow the pain to go away? And I'd to know what answer you would give to help these people understand. 

00:19:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Well, if I, (inaudible ) understand what you meant, uh, in the sense of, one should, one should not repeat it again and again and rehash the stories of the Holocaust? 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Yes, that's the confrontation that I've had experienced with people. 

00:20:10
VIKTOR FRANKL Now I think, uh, one should take, one should see to it that it be not forgotten because forgetting something like this, uh, uh, is depriving us of a chance that, to see to it that it never be repeated. But, but, there is some sort of rehashing these stories and, uh, imposing it again and again to the, to the public ad nauseum so that a negative effect is created and produced. People get fed up. We see the same in Austria. They get fed up because we know, we know already. What do you wish now for and there's always this suspicion they are, they are reaching out for still more, uh, financial, uh, recompensation. 

00:21:35
LANCE ERICKSON Compensation. 

00:21:35
VIKTOR FRANKL Compensation. You see? The suspicion is aroused in the broader public and this is of course, is counterproductive and this is what has to be avoided. It should be documented what happened, uh, in the framework of Holocaust. It should be documented in not only archives of, uh, of, uh, departments of, uh, uh, 19, 20th century history in the universities on academic, uh, grounds, in academic circles. It should also be in the newspapers, sometimes a reference to it so it be not forgotten. But I was frightened in depth when only last week, I, uh, got to hear that someone, uh, who was born in Vienna, uh, now is living in California, recently was honored by the Austrian consulate in one of, uh, California's cities with a medal or something, an award and he reacted by the following statement: He's ready to, uh, reconciliation for the future. I don't understand. That I, to be reconciled with something that not yet has happened. Anyway, he said it to the (inaudible ) in the first place, something positive. And then he, he continued saying but as to, for, uh, for the past, see what happened under the Nazi regime, I, he cannot, he said, he cannot forget but above all, he cannot forgive. Now what kind of reconciliation when I cannot forgive something that has happened, only something that doesn't exist and perhaps never will happen? So it is not only nonsense but it is ethically to be absolutely refused, such a contention. And, believe me, if you cannot forget and if you come up with, uh, up, references, references to what had happen, you are to, uh, Jews or to you and other Jews, then if you stress that I am not ready to reconcile myself with the sons and daughters or even the, uh, grandsons and granddaughters of those people, uh, who might have put some guilt, in this respect, of themselves. This is falling prey to the old typically National Socialistic Concept of (inaudible ), collective guilt at one, uh, that the whole family was made accountable for what someone has done or tried to do against National Socialist or the whole family was arrested. This was called (inaudible ), the German word, the whole family, including the nephews and the aunts and the grand, uh, parents and so forth. This is a National Socialistic Concept. Today, it's called simply collective guilt and I've been a strict, uh, uh, strictly fighting against this concept of collective guilty, believe me, since the first day after the liberation of the last concentration camp in which I had been imprisoned because is it absolutely unethical to reproach, to blame someone for what his ancestors might have done or might have permitted, failed to do. This is absolutely unethical because guilt is a absolutely personal concept. Guilt always pertains to the, first to one person. I'm accountable, I'm responsible for what I have done or what I have failed to do but never for anything that what I have not done but someone else has done or omitted to do, even if it was my, my father or my grandmother or, uh, anyone else. So this is an absolutely unethical concept and against this I've always taken a stand. Uh, recently even at a, a, uh, uh, speech of 10 minutes that I have to deliver upon the insistence of the mayor of Vienna. Uh, there were several politicians, including (inaudible ), it's a name you may be familiar, somewhat familiar. The late (inaudible ), uh, and he, uh, the mayor of Vienna wanted also, uh, a, a scientist, not a politician but a scientist to, to give a speech in front of the Mayor's Hall in Vienna addressing 35,000 people underneath the open air. And I spoke out this is my conviction and I was also attacked because I believed it was breeding for, uh, reconciliation with all those who have no personal guilt loaded on their shoulder. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:35
VIKTOR FRANKL Uh, my friend Robbie good enough reminded me that I should add, yeah, add that, uh, on that occasion I also said that, uh, there exists only, uh, National Socialists, I remember I said, have brought up the concept of racists but believe me, I told this huge audience there are, uh, uh, I think there exists only two races between quotation marks. That is the race of these people and the race of indecent people and the border, wait a minute, the line, the separating line goes across all races, all nations. No nation is exempted. In principle, each nation is capable, sooner or later, to come up with another Holocaust or with other collect (inaudible ) concepts. No, there's no group, (inaudible ) that's solely consists of decent individuals or solely or criminals or indecent people. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN Thank you for the honor of directing you, addressing you directly Dr. Frankl. Several of us are, uh, training to be logotherapists through the Kansas City Chapter of Logotherapy and we send you the greetings of our teachers, um, Minian Izenberg (ph) and thanks. 

00:29:20
VIKTOR FRANKL Mr. Yoder (ph), right? 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN And Mr. Yoder, yes. Jim Yoder. Thank you. We will, um, as you know, I'm sure, be meeting in San Jose in June for the International Logotherapy Conference and we're really wondering if you're going to be there. 

00:29:40
VIKTOR FRANKL I still wonder myself. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Well, we certainly want to welcome you. 

00:29:45
LANCE ERICKSON Professor. 

00:29:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Give regards to, uh, uh, Mr. Yoder, yeah? Dr. Yoder. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Professor Frankl? Thank you. Um, I was, uh, struck by your, uh, comparison of the note that where God in 600 looked similar and that different people interpreted differently and wondered if you would comment on another native of, of Vienna who used, uh, the duck rabbit, (inaudible ), uh, approach and, and his work with meaning, uh, and in particular the use of language. Is there any similarity with your approach to meaning or do you see it as divergent? 

00:30:25
VIKTOR FRANKL I would say similarity. I would, because, uh, perhaps, uh, uh, Wickenstein (ph) himself if he had, could, uh, perhaps he cannot when he's in Heaven, uh, would not be very satisfied with this, so I do not (inaudible ) the right to myself to, to state it's similar or not but I would say that it is compatible. Not similarity but just compatibility. 

00:30:55
LANCE ERICKSON Back there please. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, when I read about the last years of Josef Mengele, I read about how lonely he was and how fearful he was and how he had had to have an operation to remove a hairball from his stomach because he chewed his mustache constantly and, um, my thoughts on that were that, uh, he'd certainly suffered but not nearly enough for his crimes. My question is what were your feelings when you learned that he was dead and did you have any thought that he might have committed suicide? 

00:31:35
VIKTOR FRANKL I only heard of it, better to say in a newspaper that, uh, most probably he has, uh, um, been, uh, drowned in the, in the ocean, in the, in the ocean, yes? The Atlantic, uh, somewhere in Argentina or in Brazil. You never, has this rumor never reached you in the newspapers? 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN I believe it was verified by dental records. 

00:32:10
VIKTOR FRANKL Yeah, right. Identified by, by a dentist. Right. Now, uh, it's very hard to, to imagine what, for instance, would have happened if I had, if I had been given a chance to talk to him. Say there's, uh, someone, uh, many people have, have, uh, had the chance to talk extensively, uh, with, uh, Eichmann in his, uh, Israel, Jerusalem prison or some prison in Israel and if I try to imagine that I would have been, uh, been given a chance or even had, had been a request, uh, asked to, to have a conversation or a series of conversations with Mengele, I would, if you give me a few seconds to think it over, I would say I would have, uh, accepted this chance and, as I know myself, I'm not sure what I really know myself, uh, sometimes I'm, if I get myself to know I'm very, uh, not only disappointed but, uh, angry to myself. So angry that, for several days, I don't talk with myself. Anyway, I could well imagine, I could well imagine that I would have, have accepted this chance and tried, most probably tried, to bring him to that point but on a purely human level, as if I never would have been or, uh, neither any member of my family had been victim of, uh, the decision, left or right, of his, uh, finger. I would have tried to convince him, to bring him to that point where he would, uh, frankly and honestly say Dr. Frankl, now I see what you mean. Now I see that it really was a crime or a, a series of crimes that have, I have committed and may I ask you, beg you something? May I ask you to do me a favor? Please, think, think it over my, this situation and come again Dr. Frankl and tell me what you, in my place, would do now facing death penalty or whatsoever. What you would do in my place in order of, to , of, uh, to publicly demonstrate my regrets and my insight. If there's any meaning to it, and now it comes to mind that while not Mengele but Eichmann was in prison, a few people, even, it was even on, on a lecture tour through your country, really asked me the question, what would you do with Eichmann? And you know what I said? I said, as to myself, I would do something, would suggest under others to do something very strange. That is, I would delegate, say six, uh, undercover or policemen and in a, uh, (inaudible ) consecutively two always next to him, watching him and going with him, accompanying him as an (inaudible ) as it were, an (inaudible ), all over the world and having him to live on each day somewhere in the world a lecture under the title, How I Became the Eichmann. You see, what motivated him to do what he had done and where in lay the mistake and the guilt, of course, and what can be done to prevent other people to become the second, the third, and so forth Eichmann. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:15
VIKTOR FRANKL Thereby, you have been, been given a chance in the truest logotherapeutic spirit, given a chance to squeeze out, for the rest of his life, some meaning out of his fate. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Yes, Dr. Frankl, first I'd like to say that, um, many years ago, I was certainly, um, your book, um, Man's Search For Meaning had a profound effect on my life when I was doing some searching myself. I have two questions. Uh, the first is of a personal nature, if you care to comment about what role and meaning, uh, being a Jew and Judaism had, uh, during your experience in concentration camp and afterwards and also, when you spoke this morning, uh, earlier today about your meeting with the Pope. You spoke of it as a very moving meeting and, and you spoke earlier about making a distinction about collective guilt. Just what your feelings or thoughts were at the time in terms of the role of the Church and the Pope in particular in not being able to take a more active stance against what was going on. 

00:38:25
VIKTOR FRANKL I, I'm not familiar, of course and I have no access to the archives of the Vatican but the only thing that I know is that during World War II, my brother and his wife had a chance to flee to Italy and there they were confined in a little village somewhere in the mountains and they had food and they were housed and everything was okay until, uh, Hitler, due to a pact with Mussolini, uh, took over and, uh, uh, the SS from Germany invaded Italy and imprisoned immediately these, uh, groups, uh, that were of refugees who were these, uh, uh, located in different, uh, small villages, uh, in this area and since that day, nobody has heard anything. Uh, my brother could write to Vienna at that time and, uh, then he couldn't write because, uh, we couldn't be reached. We ourselves were in concentration camp, the rest of my family except of a sister who had in due time emigrated to Australia and I, afterwards, after the conclusion of World War II, I was informed that all those people were sent to Auschwitz and someone told me who had known my brother, that he was, uh, he died in a coal mine, close to Auschwitz where the prisoners of Auschwitz had to, to work under, under unimaginable conditions, living conditions, or dying conditions, it's better to say. Now let me say that as long as my brother and his, uh, the other refugees had been given a chance to survive in Italy, the only people who supported them with money and with, uh, nourishing material and so forth, morally and, and materially was the Vatican, the Pope himself. Proof thereof is that I heard and even I believe I had, uh, given a, been given a chance to see, to look at it, my brother, who was a, uh, architect and a good drawer, had to draw and to paint a huge Thanksgiving, uh, document, uh, to the Pope or in, on behalf of the whole group of refugees were so, uh, essentially, essentially supported in many, uh, respects by the Vatican. That the only thing I know. Of course I watched the, the drama of, uh, the, Swiss Hochhuth H-O-C-H-H-U-T-H, Hochhuth drama dealing, uh, with a lot of reproaches and blames with the attitude of the Vatican but, as far as I know, one has to take into consideration also that the Vatican, thereby by this compromising evil looking, morally evil looking compromising with the National Socialist, uh, Government tried to rescue thousands and thousands of Catholics, of devout Catholics, uh, under Hitler, living under Hitler from being just finished off and sent to concentration camps. So it's a, uh, a, a matter of personal, uh, preferences, whether one had, should have further uncompromised or should have taken a strict stand against National Socialist. Uh, I personally would hesitate to come up with a (inaudible ), uh, uh, so easily, you see? 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, uh, I would like to ask you to, uh, speak to the question of any anger you may or may not have had after your experiences. Um, I too was a victim of my own circumstances and I feel that one of the hardest things for me is to accept, um, that, uh, I, that this did happen to me. I often regret it. Your book was very helpful to me and yet I wish it had not happened to me and I wonder if you could address those few years after, uh, what happened to you and how you managed to overcome any negative feelings you may or may not, may not have had. Thank you. 

00:44:00
VIKTOR FRANKL Now, as to what you do if it had happened to you, you should not, there is, in principle, suffering has a meaning but this is easily said. I would have to say more cautiously, suffering may be bestowed by you with a meaning and, uh, in itself, he has not and cannot even have a meaning because it depends on what type of suffering you have to deal with. For instance, if your suffering is caused by a carcinoma, by a cancer, and this cancer turns out to be operable, that is to be, there's a chance to remove it, even forever, preventing metastasis, uh, by surgery, surgical operation, then you have to take the courage to let yourself be operated on. In other words, in this case, the cause of suffering can be removed and this means, in broad terms, it has to be removed while, if, uh, you have a cancer, suffering from a cancer that is inoperable, then you need not the courage to insist an operation, which would be encouraged anyway, but what is demanded of you is to in humility, to shoulder this terrible fate and notice that there is a last chance to imbue it with meaning by, as I started, by taking an, adopting an attitude which gives meaning into suffering. I also said at my, uh, my noon presentation, sufferings borne with courage and dignity, you remember. So if you shoulder this face, uh, any Christian would say you take your cross upon yourself with courage and dignity you not only may squeeze out meaning of such a terrible event, but even reach the highest possible level of meaning because, you see, doing a deed, creating a work, as (inaudible ) or experiencing something or loving someone, okay. But borne such a fate with dignity, this is something extraordinary. This is the highest ranking value of meaning. Recently in (inaudible ), the capital of upper Austria, an Austrian province, (inaudible ) on the Danu (ph), there's been a public opinion poll. And on the streets, people were inquired, were asked, what do you think is the highest what a human being can achieve, accomplish and the majority of the answers of the men and women on the street, notice that, was the highest what a man can, can achieve is master a very hard fate plus helping others afflicted to do so. You follow? There is speaking of the word (inaudible ) of logotherapy, who brought, someone brought it up right? In San Jose, remind, I'm reminded of this because there will appear as one of the keynote speakers a young gentleman who once, years ago, wrote a letter to Vienna and therein he said, Dr. Frankl, I read your book Man's Search for Meaning and I wanted to tell you that I was paralyzed from the neck down due to a diving incident, accident, accident, and I'm writing this letter with a wooden, with a piece of wood, uh, typing between my teeth and typing this letter and I wanted to say I broke my neck but it did not break me. What did I, do I want to convey to you that this man squeezed out some meaning, the rest of meaning for the rest of his body as it were and then he told me, I'm now (inaudible ) or what do you, I don't know what you call it. As a student in psychology in a college here or some university because I want to study psychology in order to become a, um, a clinical, a counselor, clinical psychologist and counselor because I think that my suffering will help me to help others who are involved, uh, in, in a, uh, situation that causes them suffering. In the meantime, this man has become a doctor of psychology and has, uh, is working, is a counselor, still lame, paralyzed from the neck down. In the meantime, he has married and so forth and he is an example of fulfilling both ideals that were borne out from the, from several hundreds of (inaudible ), uh, uh, questions and interviewed on the streets of (inaudible ). He was suffering, mastering his fate and not only that but also helping others by his being a counselor. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:40
VIKTOR FRANKL (inaudible ) if you see, uh, Jerry Long, Jr in, uh, uh, San Jose, give him my regards please. Will you do so? Is the lady still here? 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. I'll do that. 

00:50:55
LANCE ERICKSON She's straight ahead. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, uh, I think this, uh, I have a little story, not a question. It comes right off your last comment. On my way here, I was in the Dallas Airport and one of the hostages, uh, came off the plane from the Middle East and a number of reporters surrounded him and were asking him questions about his experience and he had a lot of positive things to say about what he had come to know through that experience. Uh, I pushed my hand through the reporters with, uh, your name and the name of your book written on it and gave it to him. Uh, he was intrigued by the title and came up to me afterwards to ask about it and I gave him a shortened version of the book. Uh, so I think you're gonna have yet another person who's undergone some suffering who will continue to give to others like you have. That's all. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Hi Dr. Frankl. This is also a great honor for me. I'm wondering about your sequel to Man's Search for Meaning maybe being Woman's Search for Meaning. 

00:52:10
[sil.] 

00:52:10
VIKTOR FRANKL Yes. Uh, you should forget that as an octogenarian, uh, I'm entitled to, uh, to think and speak and write, uh, in the language of my, uh, time. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:35
VIKTOR FRANKL Ah, and in that language, that, uh, German or English language, man meant man in German and man doesn't mean a, a male. It means (inaudible ) and you certainly will not deny that women are also human beings so man means human being and not a male or a family. It does not discriminate between both genders. You see? And I think in a way, it is similar in, in English. If you, if I speak of man's search for meaning, I mean a human being's search for meaning and not a male searching for meaning. This is, uh, inconceivable for me that one has, uh, to make the difference because I think also in English, man doesn't mean male but may also mean male but primarily it doesn't, uh, make any discrimination but it means a human being but it would, uh, sound a bit, uh, uh, strange say a human being's search for meaning. Wait a minute. You also, you also don't speak of, uh, women kind but of humankind. Why don't you speak of hu-women kind but solely of human kind. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:54:20
[sil.] 

00:54:20
LANCE ERICKSON You wanna say that? 

00:54:20
VIKTOR FRANKL You may say it. It's your responsibility. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN I would just like to add one thing, knowing, uh, Dr. Frankl for many years and that is, he has always preferred women to men. 

00:54:40
LANCE ERICKSON Back in the middle please. 

00:54:45
VIKTOR FRANKL (inaudible ). 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Dr. Frankl, uh, could you speak more on, uh, an existential theory of ethics in particular, uh. 

00:55:00
VIKTOR FRANKL In particular of? 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN Right, in, in particular on the level of existential faith, how would you differentiate narcissism or fanaticism in general, uh, from a commitment to the belief of a transcendental meaning? 

00:55:15
VIKTOR FRANKL Uh, throughout the years I spent one to two decades ago, as a professor as US International Universities down in San Diego, I was again and again asked virtually each semester by other students Dr. Frankl, you are capitalizing in your books and in your courses, lectures, responsibility, uh, and obedience to one's own conscience and, uh, listening to conscience carefully and then going on to actualize what your conscience suggests, not to say commands you to do because, you see, uh, is it an English phrase sense organs? The eyes, the ears are what is sense organs? 

00:56:25
LANCE ERICKSON (crosstalk) Yes, yes. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Senses. 

00:56:25
LANCE ERICKSON Sense organs. 

00:56:25
VIKTOR FRANKL Yeah. Now sense also means meaning, doesn't it, in English? And in German, I'm used to saying, uh, conscience is not a (inaudible ), a sense organ, but a meaning organ, an organ built in the human condition (inaudible ), uh, which enables us to get hold, to send out, as it were, the immediate meaning in, in, uh, inherent or dormant in each single life situation confronting you. Is that (inaudible )? And, uh, it shows something that no Ten Commandments, no ethical, uh, norms can teach you or, or preach to you but which is solely, uh, uh, discovered, discovered, I believe, tactical. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Discovered. 

00:57:30
VIKTOR FRANKL Discovered by this organ, uh, to find the meaning of the situation. He can know here and now. A unique situation and addressed the demand of the situation, the actualization of the potential meaning inherent in it, addressed to you as a unique person or to quote Hiller (ph) the, one of the founders of the Talmut, two millenia ago, if not now, when should I do it? If not me, who should do it. And so forth. And then they ask me, okay Dr. Frankl, but what would you have said, uh, to Hitler if he had come to your office and would you also have told him he should go on and do what, uh, his conscience tells him to do? As, uh, thereupon my stand out reaction, uh, ran, uh, read as follows. I said, I would have done so. You know why? Because, as to morals, I am an objectivist rather than a subjectivist. That is to say if Hitler had listened carefully to his true conscience, his true conscience, I cannot imagine that it ever would have commanded to commit the genocide. It's in, in, unimaginable to me because there is some objectivity in morals, in ethics. It is, but I am not, uh, one more moralist but I am rather an ontologist. That is to say, uh, the science of the philosophy dealing with, with being and, as I used to say, included, including the meaning of being and, uh, I don't think that morals any longer should try to, with a raised finger pointing outward, you should do, what you must not do and so forth. Today, this is virtually nonsense but with a, not with a raised finger, morally raised, moralistically raised finger but with a pointing finger, pointing out there is a meaning potential. Go on and actualize it. It's addressed to you and you need meaning of it, the present situation, addressed to a unique being which, uh, also you are. And then I, uh, am evoking, arousing his self, uh, responsibility, the sense of responsibility, being responsible as a unique person at this unique moment to fulfill this meaning. See, this responsibility is evoked and this is more fertile. This is more, means more and is more important, above all, than, uh, just to, to preach and teach. In other words, I would define as morally good what enhances the possibility of a being to actualize his or her meaning and I would define as morally bad what inhibits the actualization of meaning.

01:01:15
VIKTOR FRANKL (inaudible ). At the concierge in the hotel, uh, we sit down for a cup of coffee. The lady wanted to ask me something and I said she should answer, she should ask the question right here. When I first asked this lady, is she... 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm standing here, Dr. Frankl. Yes. 

01:01:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Now, uh, this will certainly take us a few minutes and I think we should, uh, elect it. 

01:01:55
LANCE ERICKSON Yes. 

01:01:55
VIKTOR FRANKL Now please, this is, I promised her to answer the question but I don't know what the question is yet. 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN I hope I can phrase it the right way. I lost three grandparents in concentration camp. My mother came out to Australia a month before the war broke out. I had other members of my family who came to Australia because their grandparents weren't accepted, uh, here in America. What I wanted your comment about was, I know there are many people, many Jews, who could have come to Australia and I'm assuming they could have come to America, too, had people in Australia or America guaranteed for them but I know what the Australians did. I'm not sure what the Americans did. But I know we consider, uh, get angry at the Germans and the Poles, etc. for what they did, uh, but I have a feeling that there are a lot of people, uh, certainly in Australia and I'm assuming here in the U.S. who could have done something to bring Jews out of, uh, the Holocaust areas but didn't do that and I was wondering if you wanted to make a comment about your own experiences? 

01:03:05
VIKTOR FRANKL Now first of all, I would warn anyone, you certainly, I've got to warn you, my impression is to, uh, ascribe collective guilt to, uh, the American or the Australian nation because or even the, the Jewish population of those nations because they didn't, uh, whatever was possible. In certain cases, it might have been that. As to Australia, I can only say that my sister had the opportunity to immigrate to Australia in due time, uh, and, uh, about a year ago, uh, her husband, her husband has reached the shores of Australia already and, uh, uh, but had to wait for a year or so until my sister could follow him. As to America, I know a bit more. I know that, uh, I was struggling to receive in what was called at that time affidavit, right? Uh, the guarantee that in case that I'm, uh, (inaudible ). That I'm foundering, floundering or what? 

01:04:25
LANCE ERICKSON No. 

01:04:25
VIKTOR FRANKL No? What I need is a, a financial health... 

01:04:30
LANCE ERICKSON A guarantor. 

01:04:30
VIKTOR FRANKL A guarantee that, uh, there's some, some sponsor who would take care of me. Now, I was waiting about three years. I had to wait until I received it. Better to say I received an invitation to come on the next day to the, uh, American Embassy or Counselor General better to say, to pick up my Visa, after years of waiting for it. It was still at the time when the United States had not yet, uh, entered into World War, World War II and my old parents, who stayed with me. I said my sister was in Australia. My brother in Italy and so forth, uh, could have been protected by me from deportation to Auschwitz and so forth because, at that time, I was the head of the department of neurology the so-called (inaudible ) Hospital in Vienna. It was the Jewish hospital and the observance of the, uh, Gestapo of course. So until the, as long as the hospital existed, my parents and myself were prevented from being deported, right? And then I received this invitation. My, uh, and my parents were just overjoyed but as to my, myself, started thinking the situation over. After all, this means that when I'm away, no longer the head of the department, no longer, uh, able to protect my, uh, prevent my, protect my parents. They would, could be, within, uh, a couple of weeks, sent to some extermination camp, although they were overjoyed, uh, assuming that, within a couple of weeks, I will immigrate to the United States, then I hesitated. I thought, realize my responsibility for my brain child, for my spiritual child, logotherapy, building it up, the new psychotherapy in the United States at that time was a (inaudible ) with a lot of success in, uh, uh, in, uh, store, in, in wait for me or one could end up thinking of a spiritual child, but of my real parents, protecting them still was further on. I didn't know where lies my responsibility and so I went to a concert. I hid my yellow star, which I was obliged to wear, went to a concert, set down for an hour in order to meditate, to think it over again and again with no solution. When I returned home, I went home and thought for a moment, I remember, I thought this is typical situation of where people are, uh, reaching out for what they call usually a hint from heaven. Is it, do you also have this phrase? 

01:08:10
LANCE ERICKSON Yes, yes. 

01:08:10
VIKTOR FRANKL A hint from heaven because you are undecided. And I went home and noticed there on the radio table a stone, there lay a stone. I asked my father, what's that? He said oh, it is, is a piece of marble. Where did you get it? I discovered it on the remnants of that place close to our, uh, house where the Nazis on the 10th, ill-fated 10th of November, destroyed and burned down all Jewish synagogues throughout Vienna. About 18 I think it was and this was the largest synagogue. And why do you, did you pick this up from the remnants? Viktor, because I noticed there is something holy. It was a piece from the two tablets on which the Ten Commandments are inscribed and engraved and in fact this piece of marble showed a Hebrew letter, gilded and engraved in marble and he then said, I can even tell you more Viktor. This, uh, Hebrew letter is the only one among the ten others, the nine others, which, uh, is the symbol, serves as the abbreviation of a commandment. The only one. So it must pertain, uh, to this one commandment and which one, I asked him, and he answered Honor father and mother and you will stay in the land. Thereupon I immediately acknowledged this and made the decision to remain in the land, to stay with my parents and let the Visa lapse on the last day, I didn't go to the Counselor. See? Now all of you are fully entitled to say, Dr. Frankl, this is just some sort of a projective test because you just projected a decision you had made in the depth of your heart already long before to remain in Austria and Vienna with your parents. Okay, but then I ask the, the respective person what about some guy who would have seen in that marble piece of, piece of marble, nothing but calcium carbonate which is the chemical formula for marble? Is this not a projective test? Yes, but it would have projected into this stone his own existential vacuum, his inner meaninglessness and emptiness. Thank you.
