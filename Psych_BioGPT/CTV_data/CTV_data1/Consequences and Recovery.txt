The Other Side of Cannabis | Negative Effects of Marijuana on our Youth DOCUMENTARY A HeartsGate Production PART 2 CONSEQUENCES/RECOVERY EDUCATIONAL SERIES Consequences Dr. Kenneth Duckworth Medical Director, (NAMI) National Alliance on Mental Illness 

00:00:20
DR. KENNETH DUCKWORTH I sat my daughter's down. I just let them know that this isn't a pool you're jumping into that may or may not have water. And you have really have to think through that I can't be there and make decisions for you, but I want you to remember that some decisions you make in life as teenagers can have long-term consequences. One of the problems of the marijuana could be is I feel this risk has been underplayed or ignored. 

00:00:45
Jared age 23, San Louis Obispo, CA 

00:00:45
JARED Marijuana disabled. I was pretty high functioning person and, ah, after I smoked a lot of weed, ah, I wasn't able to function the same ways I had before. When it feels good, it isn't always good for you. I know that because I did what it felt good for a long time and it destroyed my life. 

00:01:05
Nikki age 46, San Louis Obispo, CA 

00:01:10
NIKKI My dependence on marijuana to get through life, to cope, to show up for work was awfully similar to my friend's habits with heroin and alcohol. 

00:01:25
Carlos age 37, Arroyo Grande, CA 

00:01:30
CARLOS To, to support my addiction, that period I had to sell drugs, in a way I would get, get drugs for free. And, ah, that led to many years in county jail, prison and, ah, loss of my family, my children, my friends, and most precious to me, my time. 

00:01:55
Joseph age 34, homeless 

00:01:55
JOSEPH Yeah, I should have stopped to buy, I should have stopped to pa-- when I, when I had the chance a long time ago. I was in a Mixed Martial Arts, I used to train with the Diaz brothers, they're pretty well-- pretty much more famous in Mixed Martial Arts community. And, ah, for one simple product I pay stupid(ph) training. 

00:02:15
NIKKI When I was using it, I didn't developed, I didn't grow, I didn't mature at all the way I was supposed to, the way that my other friends were, they were getting married, having careers, and I this really, really driven person in high school, that was all gone. And all those years are gone. And I haven't gotten it back. 

00:02:40
Dr. Eden Evens, MD, MPH, Cox Family Psychiatry Professor Harvard/Director MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:02:45
DR. EDEN EVENS So some people can use apparently use occasionally can really have very few obvious consequences from using. They had to continue to do well in school, work, etcetera. Whereas, other people begin to use and they don't-- unable to keep using occasionally, they begin to use everyday, if they don't use, they have cravings. Ah, if they try to abstain, we find it-- that happens more optimum and people start using early in their life before age 25. They have cognitive side effects. Many of those seemed to away within 30 days of abstinence but it appears that some may persist, okay, and this is-- I'm being vague because we need much more information. But what we know so far should worry us. 

00:03:25
Erica age 17, Boulder, CO 

00:03:25
ERICA I am a martial artist so it really made me pretty apathetic about my training and my competition. Smoking a lot made my competitive life difficult because my lungs were messed up and because I just didn't care. 

00:03:45
Matthew Landstrom Psy.D Neuro Psychologist Chicago, IL 

00:03:45
MATTHEW LANDSTROM Ah, marijuana is-- every time you use, you're adding a little piece to a big car accident, a really severe car accident. And your result would be the same result as having, ah, traumatic brain injury, ah, severe concussion. Uhm, and every time you use it just incrementally adds one little piece bit by bit overtime. 

00:04:05
JARED I lost my friend to cancer. And, ah, it would have been nice to spend more time with him when weren't getting high. It's sad you know, you're not gonna be able to see that person ever again. 

00:04:20
Matt age 52, Los Oss, CA 

00:04:20
MATT My, ah, ability to concentrate and, ah, with my reading especially, if I smoked and then read I wouldn't remember a single word that I had just read. 

00:04:35
JOSEPH I'm homeless, it was 9 years ago in December I was in a car accident. Me and a good friend of mine we went to a party at a bar, we're having a good time. All I remember is, we were smoking a whole lot of weed that night. He drove me home, it was the morning of the accident at 3-- 3:30 in the morning, December 10th, 2005, I just turned 25. I had a swelling in my brain. Every 2 weeks I had to go back in the hospital where I had these whole pumping in my eardrums like (inaudible ) out. When I have money I have-- still have to pay for my friend's funeral, my casket, headstone, graveside, flowers. 

00:05:20
ERICA I almost died because I was really, really high and I was sitting on like a rock somewhere like in (inaudible ) and I almost just like fell off, and like I barely caught myself. 

00:05:30
Brandon Bergmon PhD Clinical Psychology Addiction Medicine Harvard Medical/Mass General Hospital 

00:05:35
BRANDON BERGMON In Colorado where not it's, it's legal, they're seeing the rates of fatal car accidents where marijuana uses in the system of people that were involved in the car accidents had shut up, and they've controlled for all sorts of alternative and the explanations to that. 

00:05:55
Marijuana As a Gateway Jack age 21, Chicago, IL 

00:06:00
JACK I had gone very suicidal. I decided it would be a good time to do all the drugs I wanted to do. 

00:06:10
MAGGIE If I hadn't tried marijuana, I would have tried all these other drugs. I was a gateway drug for me. It led to a lot more dangerous drugs, it just kept adding on and then more consequences came and I eventually was in a hospital and then I was in rehab. 

00:06:25
CARLOS Other drugs came into the picture. So for me, marijuana was truly a gateway drug, you know, it truly was and I, and I progressed into more hardcore drugs such as psy-- you know, psychedelic, LST, mushrooms, ah, cocaine, methamphetamines. And, ah, once I opened that door, everything, everything turned, turned bad. There was not anything positive about any of that stuff. I dropped at high school, I was incarcerated, uhm, at the age of 18. 

00:07:00
Deb Roberts Mother, Executive Director iThrive Recovery Boulder, CO 

00:07:05
DEB ROBERTS I would guess that Halt(ph) went into really full-blown addiction probably within a year of his beginning use of marijuana. We said to the counselor, "but it just marijuana," and the counselor said, "there's no such thing as just marijuana," and you can become addicted to marijuana and it can lead to other things. Halt(ph) started stealing from us. Sara(ph), got a laptop for Christmas, he pawned it. Halt(ph) had kept blaming everything on everybody else. He took his drug test, he was positive for marijuana and cocaine, and meth. He had graduated from marijuana to try on heavier drugs cuz he was getting not as high anymore. It was October, he came to us and said, "You know what, I recognized I can't stop on my own." He went to, ah, an inpatient treatment program. He did so well. Halt(ph) relapsed. He probably was sober, maybe 9 months, uhm, but all of a sudden we started getting phone calls from him and from his girlfriend, both of my brothers are at our vacation home. And Mike said, "Deb, we've been trying to reach you all day. It's about Halt(ph). Halt(ph) drowned today." 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:09:00
DEB ROBERTS I said, "So, you're telling me my son is dead." So I dropped the phone, you know, and, and I don't know what sound I made, almost like wailing. So much dies when your son dies, not only the joy of him physically being here with you, enjoying each other's presence but all the dreams you had for him and for you with him.

Marijuana and the Brain Brandon age 20, Detroit, MI 

00:09:45
BRANDON Knowing that it can do damage to my developing brain, as that change to what I think of it, I guess, I guess it really done. 

00:10:00
Jodi Gilman Ph.D NeuroScience, Harvard/MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:10:05
JODI GILMAN You know, I recently received the grant to study the effects of marijuana on the brain particularly in young adults, ah, recreational users. So these are young adults between the ages of 18 to 25 who use marijuana regularly, uhm, anything from once or twice a week, everyday. And, uhm, what we do is we do a whole, uhm, variety of cognitive tests and we compared the MRI scans of those who used with those who don't use and we found some interesting differences between those two groups. Uhm, particularly in brain regions that are very important in, ah, the development of addiction and in emotional processing. That marijuana does affect, uhm, some key cognitive functions in the brain such as memory, working memory, long term memory. A key take home message is that there are effects on brain. I think it's very naive for people to think that you take psychoactive compounds and you ingest it and it gets you high and there are no effects on the brain. 

00:11:05
Dr. Kenneth Stoller MD Hyperbaric Medicine San Francisco, CA 

00:11:05
DR. KENNETH STOLLER My concern is always that until the brain is mature, until you're 25 years old, you do not want to be rearranging your neuronal, ah, network in a way that's not suiting you in the long-run. So if you're a-- abusing marijuana, the chance of you being able to focus and concentrate, ah, is going to be at risk and, and I don't that's as a great-- a threat to someone who's you know, 45 and throughout their back at for a 15 year old who's the neuronal networks are not solidified, that brain is not completely melanized. Uhm, ah, putting a dampening agent in there is probably not the healthiest thing. 

00:11:55
AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED BY CANNABINOIDS CEREBRAL CORTEX HYPOTHALAMUS AMYGDALA HIPPOCAMPUS BASAL GANGLIA CEREBELLUM BRAIN STEM Healthy Brain Marijuana User's Brain 

00:12:00
JODI GILMAN Something that surprised me about the study where we did brain scans of the, ah, young adult users and none users is that these users by and large were, were recreational users. Uhm, they were regular users, they use at least once a week, but a lot of them were not, uhm, very heavy users. A lot of them did not use everyday. And the fact that at this young age, we can look at an MRI and we could see differences in structures between users and none users, uhm, after you know, sometimes only a year of use, it was surprising to me. 

00:12:35
Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:12:35
DR. DONALD MISCH For those who start using early, so those who use in, in puberty or early to middle adolescence were increasing concern about, uhm, neurological human brain development. And whether or not they're maybe long-term effects of using at that time, both in terms of cognition so the ability to think, remember, ah, make good decisions and so forth. And there's also data that makes us concern that early users of marijuana are more prone to be addicted to both marijuana and other substances as well. 

00:13:15
Avani G. Gilger MA, LPC, DTR, CAC Founder/Director, Natural Highs, Boulder, CO BRAIN CHEMICAL DRUG ANANDAMIDE THC 

00:13:15
AVANI G. GILGER But we know what-- how THC comes into the adolescent brain. I would not it's safe at all, you know, I have this conversations a lot with parents who would say, "Isn't it better when my kid, you know, smokes in the house, where they are safe." Here you'd see is a copy of a natural neurotransmitter called Anandamide and we really desperately need Anandamide to calm our brain down on our own. So, if somebody starts using THC product and marijuana, their body stops making the-- its own natural Anandamide and so then people have more and more trouble calming themselves down. So then you have people who feel they more and more rely on a drug to even be able to go to sleep or be even to eat. 

00:14:00
Erica age 17 

00:14:00
ERICA When you use a substance, it copies the original neurochemical that your brain produces on its own. 

00:14:10
Normal Dopamine Delivery in the Brain 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN Anandamide is our body's natural neurochemical that enters the brain through the cannabinoid receptor. It then attaches to the GABA receptor which slowly releases dopamine into the brain's reward center. 

00:14:30
ERICA People get high when they do substance cuz it's an excess of chemical that your brain is not used to. 

00:14:35
THC in the Brain 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN THC mimics Anandamide entering the cannabinoid receptor but then it bypasses the GABA receptor causing a flooding of dopamine into the reward center of the brain. 

00:14:55
ERICA When you do a substance repeatedly, your brain thinks that there's already way too much of that chemical and it shuts down the natural production. 

00:15:05
Dopamine Loss in the Brain Damaged Cannabinoid receptor Dopamine Damaged GABA Receptor Reward Center *Depression 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Through repeated use, the body stops producing Anandamide, the receptors become damaged leaving a void of dopamine in the reward center. 

00:15:20
ERICA When you take away the drug, you don't have the natural production of that neurochemical that makes you feel good normally. So then there's like an absence and that leads to depression or like withdrawal, the lack of chemicals in the brain is what keeps people coming back to the drug to get the feeling again because their body isn't use to making it anymore. 

00:15:45
Basal Ganglia Nigrostriatal Dopamine Pathway Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway Substantia Nigra Tegmentum Mesocortical Dopamine Pathway Hypothalamus 

00:15:45
CALL When I first got to high school, I joined the group called Natural Highs, uhm, where we teach peers and teenagers and adult sometimes to about the actual brain chemistry behind what happens when you take a substance. But when you teach an adult or a peer or especially a teenager who's using it about what actually happens when they use marijuana, they start to be able to realize that the changes that are happening are actually chemical changes cuz once the teenager knows why that's happening, they can make the conscious decision through themselves to either use nothing at all or ease into something that's a better lifestyle for them and more beneficial. And they can learn how to fuel themselves in the way that marijuana would make them feel but they can use their own natural brain chemistry to do it. 

00:16:35
Mental Health Effects Austin age 17 

00:16:40
AUSTIN I went through like pretty bad depression where, where I almost thought it like the flood effect where you start not feeling anything, you're not scared of anything. 

00:16:50
Jack age 21, Chicago, IL 

00:16:50
JACK My depression got even, even worse. Every time I was in the car, I'll be praying that someone would just come and slam into me and I would die. 

00:17:00
John McGuinness BA, CADC, Program Director F.A.I.R. Recovery, Chicago, IL 

00:17:00
JOHN MCGUINNESS So with the marijuana use disorders that are coming in more of our kids, our what we called dual diagnosed and research has, has proven that marijuana use actually escalates depression or anxiety so these kids are gonna be more depressed and more anxious and they're gonna on more medication when the reality is that you were just stop the, the marijuana use you may not need all the medication. Smart psychologist and psychiatrist are starting to figure this out and saying, I'm not going to put any adolescent on meds if I know that they're using marijuana. 

00:17:45
JARED I think there was definitely a connection between our mind feeling extremely depressed and my marijuana use. I struggle everyday with depression. 

00:17:55
Jill Bolster-White Director, Transitions Mental Health Association San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:18:00
JILL BOLSTER-WHITE The people who've used marijuana for many, many years are sort of part of their coping strategy, we definitely find that it has a negative impact on the effect of medications. Anti-depressants in particular, so it can actually blent its effectiveness. 

00:18:15
ERICA For a long time, marijuana did contribute a lot to my depression but I was too intoxicated to even recognize that I was feeling worse even after I was high. 

00:18:30
Evan age 24, San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:18:30
EVAN All the fears that I had in the world, ah, started to dominate and I found myself lying backwards on the couch, uhm, unable to shake just absolutely terror. I had no idea I could get this messed up that where the head apart. 

00:18:45
JOHN MCGUINNESS We see this disproportionate anger set in and then on top of that there's depression where they have this apathy towards all of life. I don't care about anything. We also see this extreme high anxiety. 

00:19:05
Avani G. Gilger MA, LPC, DTR, CAC Founder/Director, Natural Highs, Boulder, CO 

00:19:05
AVANI G. GILGER I work as a substance of abuse counselor and so there are days when I see one kid after the other come in. They have also seen a psychiatrist because they have suddenly ADD symptoms, they suddenly deal with depression, they suddenly deal with anxiety. Sometimes, I challenged the kids and say, "Well, who knows maybe you offset your brain chemistry with your marijuana use. Why don't you stay clean for 2 months and maybe you don't have psychiatric issues after all." A lot of symptoms whether they look like ADD symptoms or bipolar symptoms or depression symptoms or anxiety completely clear up when somebody starts incline. 

00:19:45
Call age 17, Boulder, CO 

00:19:50
CALL A lot of people who instead of feeling the chill out sensation of marijuana, uhm, actually feel very paranoid when they smoke. And that is not uncommon, uhm, but they continue to do it because they know that other friends are doing it and they don't wanna stop doing what their peers are doing. And they notice that the more they smoke, they'll feel better instantly, and they'll feel better in the moment but after it they start feeling much, much worse. And it didn't solve any of their problems. 

00:20:15
Psychosis 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Psychosis is a psychiatric condition that causes someone lose their sense of reality. They may have hallucinations, delusions or disorganized thinking. 

00:20:30
Tom Father, San Francisco Bay Area, CA 

00:20:30
TOM My son first started smoking when he was probably 14 or 15. He was using very healthy to the point where he was smoking when he got up in the morning. Uhm, and all through the evening that eventually trigger the total psychotic brain. Ah, one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen, ah, he ended up hospitalized, he came back out. Still decided marijuana wasn't the problem, started using again was back in the hospital within 3 weeks. 

00:21:00
MARIJUANA'S EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN HYPOTHALAMUS Controls Appetite, Hormonal Levels & Sexual Behavior BASAL GANGLIA Involved in Motor Control & Planning and Initiation & Terminization of Action AMYGDALA Responsible for Anxiety, Emotion & Fear BRAIN STEM & SPINAL CORD Important in the Vomiting Reflex & Sensation of Pain. NEOCORTEX Higher Cognitive Functions & Integration of Sensory Information HIPPOCAMPUS Important for Memory, Learning of Facts, Sequences & Places CEREBELLUM Center for Motor Control & Coordination 

00:21:00
AVANI G. GILGER So what I've seen is that kids suddenly end up in the emergency room with symptoms like paranoia, or severe suicidality. And then when we ask and look what actually happened, it's very clear that you know, somebody started using marijuana and somebody start getting really into using marijuana like daily. And then people's depression got worse and to the point that literally they feel that they don't even know how to cope anymore. 

00:21:35
ANN My name is Ann, I'm from Boulder, Colorado. When my son Brent(ph) was 17 years old, he had an experience with marijuana that triggered a major change in his mental state. Before this experience, he was a normal teenager. He had a close group of friends, a part-time job on the weekends, excellent grades and plans to go to CU in the fall. In December of 2006, he went to a party, he smoked a lot of marijuana and he experienced a sudden major psychotic break. There was no other drug involved or mixed into the marijuana as other kids were also smoking it and none of them had a bad reaction. The morning after the party, he said that he had made a big mistake and he felt that marijuana had damaged and even ruined him. The pupils of his eyes were heavily dilated and stayed that way and he lost his peripheral vision. Both symptoms of marijuana overdose. In the next 3 days, the changes were so intense that he was hospitalized, medicated with an anti-psychotic drug and given therapy. But at the end of 3 weeks, he took his own life. Most researchers agree that there is a potential for marijuana to bring psychosis in those with a genetic predisposition to it. However, the doctors who treated my son seemed unaware of this potential as he had to insisted then that marijuana was the cause of his mental breakdown. 

00:23:10
Dr. Kenneth Duckworth Medical Director, (NAMI) National Alliance on Mental Illness 

00:23:15
DR. KENNETH DUCKWORTH So the question is, do you wanna be the person who developed the psychotic illness as a result of some unknown as yet genetic risk. And so when smoking marijuana activates, ah, psychosis, it may or may not be irreversible. 

00:23:30
Joanna Flight Attendant, Mom 

00:23:35
JOANNA My son, uhm, he's, ah, psychosis or his paranoia, uhm, was not present before he started using pot. 

00:23:45
Michael O'Brien RAS, FAC, CSC Pacific Addiction Center San Jose, CA 

00:23:45
MICHAEL O'BRIEN I see clients all the time come in, uhm, they're hearing voices, uhm, see things that other people don't see, hearing commands, uhm, and it often time presents like schizophrenia but actually it's just the results of the marijuana. 

00:24:00
James age 39 

00:24:00
JAMES Of these fantasies, and my reality were just blending together. My dad has, ah, a black helmet, he would get ready to go work and, uhm, he put on his helmet and I and I thought he was like Darth Vader or something and I attacked him. And my mom of course called the police and then, uhm, I got 50-51. But I wasn't taking you know, mushrooms, I wasn't doing psychedelic, this is just smoking marijuana. 

00:24:30
DR. KENNETH DUCKWORTH Ah, I worked at the first episode of psychosis clinic Harvard Medical School and I'm impressed at the correlation that I have seen in the number of young people who began to hear voices or developed delusional beliefs in the context of smoking marijuana. Another truth is that there are other people smoking marijuana who don't develop this risk. But no one is good enough to be able to predict who is safe and who is at risk. And this is why I think the teenagers need to approach this with a good deal, more cautioned. And I also feel they should have a good handle on their family history. 

00:25:05
JARED I smoked marijuana today, I would have-- I'll most likely to be hospitalized because it causes a mental breakdown for me. 

00:25:15
Brandon Bergmon PhD Clinical Psychology Addiction Medicine Harvard Medical/Mass General Hospital 

00:25:15
BRANDON BERGMON We're still learning a lot about the effects that marijuana use has on mental illness particularly in those that have a family knows it have family history of psychotic disorder or, or bipolar disorder. Some of them who are, uhm, biologically loaded mental illnesses. Uhm, they can develop a psychotic illness that doesn't subside even when they stop using marijuana. 

00:25:35
Jodi Gilman Ph.D NeuroScience, Harvard/MGH Center for Addiction Medicine 

00:25:35
JODI GILMAN There's a very strong association between, uhm, smoking cannabis and the development of psychosis schizophrenia. We have not established causality. Uhm, actually, we know that smoking cannabis does not cause schizophrenia because the rates of cannabis use are very high and the rates of schizophrenia are very low. But the association is there. So people who have a genetic predisposition towards some of the psychotic disorders should not be smoking cannabis. 

00:26:05
Dr. Donald Misch Senior Vice-Chancellor Health and Wellness University of Colorado, Boulder 

00:26:05
DR. DONALD MISCH So the fact that you maybe predisposed doesn't necessarily mean you will become psychotic at one point in life. The fear is that those who are predisposed, who use marijuana may precipitate psychosis that otherwise might have occurred or might not have occurred at that particular time. People who are anxious, depressed, have PTSD, psychosis may use marijuana to try and relieve their symptoms. On the other hand, it's also probable that marijuana may cause some of those symptoms or increase some of those symptoms as well. 

00:26:40
Brad Rudd LMFT, Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:26:40
BRAD RUDD I've had clients that were heavy pot users that I started to see them evolve, ah, the symptoms of paranoia to the point of being psychotic. 

00:26:55
Physical Effects ER visits -- related to marijuana use -- have increased dramatically over the past year. Among 12-24 year olds, marijuana was by far the top illicit drug sending people to the ER in the U.S. Adverse effects reported were: anxiety, confusion, panic attacks, hallucinations... Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome that causes uncontrollable, excessive vomiting and agonizing stomach pain. 

00:27:30
DR. DONALD MISCH Serious of disturbing case reports of young people, so I'm talking people who are even teenagers, who have suffered strokes, heart attacks, and other vascular complications. We have not proven that marijuana cause those, but what's disturbing is that kids that age have no business having those sorts of disorders, having heart attack or stroke. And there was no other obvious cause for it. 

00:27:55
Dr. Jean Luc Martinot INSERM, PARIS Director of Research on Marijuana and Tobacco Addiction Marijuana growers are increasingly using pesticides to protect valuable crops. Up to 70% of pesticides found in marijuana can end up in the smoke being inhaled. These chemicals go directly into the blood stream through the lungs. Bacteria and mold were also found in marijuana --exposure can lead to infections... which is a risk for medicinal users with compromised immune systems. Other effects reported in recent studies include... • Decrease in IQ • Dementia/Alzheimers/Memory Loss • Suicide/Suicidal Ideation • Impaired Motor Functions & Coordination • Bronchitis • Cancer 

00:27:55
DR. JEAN LUC MARTINOT Using pot scans, one of Europe's leading marijuana researchers has seen modifications to the central brain region of heavy adult marijuana users. There's a 20% decrease in the dopamine neurotransmitter. It's quite significant because the first sign of the neurological illness Parkinson's disease shows a 25% decrease in those same transporters. Marijuana growers are increasingly using pesticides to protect the valuable crops. Up to 70% of pesticides found in marijuana can end up in the smoke being inhaled. These chemicals go directly into the blood stream through the lungs. Bacteria and mold were also found in marijuana, exposure can lead to infections which is a risk for medicinal users with compromised immune systems. Other effects reported in recent studies include decrease in IQ, dementia, Alzheimer's, memory loss, suicide, suicidal ideation, impaired motor functions and coordination and can lead to bronchitis as well as cancer. 

00:29:10
Recovery 

00:29:15
DR. DONALD MISCH It's true that to successfully treat an addiction, you often need a change in friends. That if you continued to associate with people who use drugs, use the drug that you abused have a drug using identity, isn't very hard to stop. And you can imagine that's a problem on a-- on the average American college campus. 

00:29:40
MATT It was probably peer influences were the biggest, ah, part of me starting up again. And it seems like that as always been the reason why I've gone back to it because people around me, my friends, ah, acquaintances. 

00:29:50
CALL A big part of saying sober and a big part of staying happy I think its community. And so if I'm feeling isolated in my sobriety, uhm, it's not really getting me anywhere. So I do, uhm, try to find a peer group of friends that are not using substance. 

00:30:05
NIKKI I would never pick it up again because it was so hard to quit of my 7 to 9 years smoking, I spent 4 to 6 years of those struggling with stopping, just wanting to put it down, just wanting to live without it. 

00:30:25
Evan age 24, San Luis Obispo, CA 

00:30:25
EVAN I realize like what, whatever solution I have found in marijuana just wasn't working anymore. 

00:30:30
JOSEPH I highly suggest that, anybody to who try to start right now, if they're young, don't. It's not worth it. Sooner or later I, I know that it's gonna, it's gonna come up to what I-- that I have make a, a choice you know, back to sober up and get back on my feet. It's just-- the precision is hard-- kinda hard after you-- after you've been in, in that. 

00:31:05
BRANDON You know, I don't plan on smoking weed forever in my whole life you know. I do plan on quitting. It's not easy to quit what you've got, you know, ah, when you're around a lot of weed smokers.

JOANNA He had-- he was a different child when he was in rehab. He went to work, he walked 4 miles a day to get through his bussing job, he was never late. He was able to pay his (inaudible ) living fees. He was a different-- he was the child that I had lost. 

00:31:35
CARLOS Due to the 12-step program that I'm now involved in, I feel like I, I got new list on life, thanks to AB109 program that is, ah, nonviolent drug offenders. Allows them to get an early release and help them in any way such as housing, uhm, drug rehabilitation, and second chance of life. 

00:32:00
NIKKI The good things that have happened since I've been sober, uhm, I have grown closer and repair the relationship with my brother. I've started businesses, store friends. 

00:32:15
MAGGIE Say your past day high is worse than your worst day sober. So, I truly do believe that because even when I'm having bad days, I know that if I picked up that drug, that it would be way worse than whatever it is I'm going through. You know, they say one day the time which I am living one time at time but at the same time when I think of the future, I don't think, "Oh, when I'm 21, why I wanna be able to drink," I think when I'm 21, I'm back and drink and when I'm 30, I'm not gonna drink.

00:32:45
COLLIN Keeping me sober is probably myself cuz I know it's a choice that I have to make everyday and I have to remind myself that everyday that I at any point I can got back but I don't want to because I know that I'm happy right now and everyday is the next best day of my life. On my 21st birthday, it's just gonna be another day. Honestly, it's-- I just just gonna wake and go about my day, just gonna be another day. 

00:33:15
EVAN If you look at the positive you're like, I get, I get my life now, this is my life to live. I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna go ahead to do something with it. If I stay in gratitude that's gonna keep me there. 

00:33:30
CARLOS It's overwhelming joy, it really is to wake up and go to work everyday for waging it's more than 8 cents an hour, and, uhm, to drive my own vehicle there, to, ah, be a productive member of society. I used to think that, that term the so blamed(ph). To-- for me to be a productive member of society is truly a blessing. 

00:34:00
NIKKI It really just-- I just had to get up and try everyday. It was, uhm, a lot like running. It's like if you're a runner, you get up and you put your shoes on and you go out for a run, you just don't talk about it. You don't just buy the magazine, you don't just buy the clothes, you do it. And that's what it took for me to get sober. I had to do it. And every time I, I failed, it didn't matter, I was one step closer. I would just try to embrace life and just never, never, never give up. 

00:34:35
JACK In sobriety, I have a lost for life now that I'd never had even before I ever started. I am so excited to live and to go for the things that I want. 

00:34:45
ERICA Sobriety for me has been pretty awesome actually. Uhm, it's m-- helped me make more genuine connections with people. 

00:34:55
EVAN I never had any issues with depression or anxiety since, you know, yeah, you may, you may get the case-- occasional case of the blues or be super anxious for a very good reason, who doesn't, right? But the neurological balance, ah, for me, I know there's some people who did-- people who struggle with other disorders and that now would entail, ah, regular treatment as anybody else would but for, ah, for me, ah, for me it only happened to be, ah, an effect of the addiction. 

00:35:25
CARLOS To know today because of recovery, it just allowed me to make amends you know, that hurt and, uhm, today, I wanna make a living amends to those out there that are struggling because, ah, it's possible, recovery is possible. 

00:35:45
MATT I am very happy that I'll (inaudible ) and I don't wanna see anybody start using pot at any age, ah, and specially at a very young age. 

00:36:00
AUSTIN When I started using it was like (inaudible ) slow like I don't care as long as I make enough money to smoke weed. Now it's like, I want a house, you know, I wanna, I wanna like raise a family and stuff too and I hope to get there one day. Like I wanna get a speedboat like I don't know why, like I want that so badly but it's the most relaxing and peaceful serenity thing that I could think of that I want in my life. And I know like if I was still smoking weed, I'd wouldn't want that. Like that's the best thing about sobriety for me is like I want things. It just makes me happy because I get a push for things. You know, if it's as stupid as getting like a speedboat and just driving everyday. Out in the river would be just awesome. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN I am so grateful for my son's recovery. It is a process that has taken years to evolve, the long-term outcome of the negative effects of marijuana is still unknown. We just take it one day at a time. 

00:37:10
JARED Recovery from marijuana is definitely a good thing. It's not an easy life, clean from all substance is hard. I work 12-step program to stay sober and I work with the sponsor and I attend 12-step meetings. Since I've been sober, I've been able to rekindle relationships with old friends. Start a relationship with a girlfriend. I rekindle family relationships and, ah, and start new ones. 

00:37:45
MAGGIE Hi. Birds flying high you know how I feel. Sun in the sky you know how I feel. Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me. Oh. And I'm feeling good.
