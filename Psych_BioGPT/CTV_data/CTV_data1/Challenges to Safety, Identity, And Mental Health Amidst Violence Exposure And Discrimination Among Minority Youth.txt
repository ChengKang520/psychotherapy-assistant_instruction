CHALLENGES TO SAFETY, IDENTITY, AND MENTAL HEALTH AMIDST VIOLENCE EXPOSURE AND DISCRIMINATION AMONG MINORITY YOUTH Usha Tummala-Narra, Ph.D. Boston College 

00:02:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Good morning everybody. It's really great to be here and I'm delighted to have an opportunity to share some of my with you. Uhm, this is of course a very broad topic. The title of my talk today is challenges to safety, identity and mental health, amidst violence exposure and discrimination among ethnic minority youth. That's a mouthful. There's a lot to think about with this topic. But what I thought I would do today is present to you a series of quantitative and qualitative research that I've conducted within the context of an, uhm, a high school, ah, with a number of adolescents, uhm, to help us think about what some of the most pertinent issues particularly around race and ethnicity, ethnic identity, uhm, have to do with violence exposure and the exposure to discrimination across time. 

00:03:15
OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH • Assessing violence exposure, mental health needs and identity issues among racial minority and immigrant-origin high school students • Series of quantitative and qualitative studies • Designing and implementing interventions addressing issues of race, ethnicity, and discrimination • Future directions 

00:03:15
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA So, uhm, I'm gonna share a little bit of, ah, the overview first of this research and I'm also hoping of course to leave some time at the end for questions and discussion. Uhm, so the-- this particular line of research concerns violence exposure as it relates to mental health outcomes. Uhm, also helped seeking and, ah, ethnic identity issues. Uhm, as I mentioned, this is-- these involves a series of quantitative and qualitative studies and, uhm, also we used these, these particular research to inform some, ah, pilot interventions that we're continuing to try in this particular high school, which is a very large high school and I'll describe, uhm, the community, uhm, in which we worked with. And this was a collaborative effort with the head of guidance at this particular high school, as well as the principal, various teachers, students at the high school and also my graduate, ah, students from Boston College. So we were a large team of people working on this research. 

00:04:20
HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNITY • Racially, culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse urban area • Over two-thirds of the student community identifies as racial and/or ethnic minorities (primarily Asian American, Latino/a American, and Afro-Caribbean students) • Relatively little racial diversity among teachers and guidance and administrative staff 

00:04:20
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, this-- first of all the high school community is a racially, culturally, linguistically, economically diverse, uhm, urban area. It's situated in, ah, a diverse urban area. Uhm, over two-thirds of the student community identifies as racial and/or ethnic minorities primarily Asian-American, Latino-American, and Afro-Caribbean students. There's a high, ah, immigrant, uhm, origin community, ah, in fact just several years before I started my work at the high school, there was a, ah, uhm, there was a shift in demographics and that all of a sudden, the T if you're familiar with Boston and the T that is our Subway system, although most of it is over-ground and were buried in snow right now. So, I feel very lucky to be here today coming from Boston, uhm, but in any case the, uhm, T suddenly opened up, uhm, ah, a separate line that, uhm, that led into those particular part of the city and, ah, all of a sudden there was, ah, pretty mass movement from the Chinatown area of Boston into this particular area. So many of the students who were attending this particular high school were newly immigrated to the United States or their families were neur-- newly immigrated to the United States, but on top of that there was a shift moving away from Chinatown into, uhm, this, ah, this new area of the city. Uhm, there's also relatively little racial diversity among teachers and guidance and administrative staff. And this is an important point to keep in mind, uhm, Doctor Politanski talked extensively about the context and so I want you to keep this in mind as we think about the findings, uhm, today as I share them with you, because the way that the kids experienced their particular school environment and part reflex this kind of disparity between, who the staff were? Who they were interacting with in terms of the adults? Who was available to them and, and the student body itself? 

00:06:20
STUDY 1: EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADOLESCENTS Tummala-Narra, Li, Liu, & Wang, 2014 EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE (ETV) • Pervasive public health concern • 2008 and 2011 National Surveys of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) • 2011: 41% of children in the U.S. were physically assaulted within the previous year, and 55% had been assaulted during their lifetime • 48% of children reported more than one form of victimization (physical, sexual) in the past year, 15% reported six or more , and 5% reported more than 10 or more. Adolescents are twice as likely to experience violence in comparison to the U.S. population, as a whole. 

00:06:20
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so this is the first study I'm gonna share with you. There'll be three, the first two are, ah, survey-based studies. Uhm, the first one had to do, ah, with exposure to violence and mental health outcomes among, ah, a group of adolescents. And we looked primarily at, uhm, ninth and 10th graders in the school. Ah, we were interested in-- we focused on ninth and 10th graders particularly because we wanted to follow some of these kids, uhm, over the next several years, uhm, and so we began with the younger age groups. So just, ah, uhm, brief background on exposure to violence we know of course that this is a pervasive public health concern in the United States and globally. Uhm, if we look at the, ah, National Surveys of Children's Exposure to Violence, this is a 2011, ah, base survey find the, the following statistics. Forty-one percent of children in the U.S. physically assaulted within the past year, 55% had been assaulted at some point during their lifetime. Uhm, 48% of kids report more than one form of victimization, right, physical, sexual and then you see, you know, it goes on here. Adolescents are also twice as likely to experience violence, uhm, in comparison to the broader U.S. population, so this is a highly vulnerable group. 

00:07:40
ETV & MENTAL HEALTH ACROSS SETTINGS • No conclusive findings • Home: Relationships with caretakers that involve violence may exacerbate sense of insecurity and, subsequently, heighten risk for mental health problems. • School: Peers are especially influential. • Community: Associated with higher rates of substance use, anxiety, depression, aggression: academic difficulties (Buka et al., 2001) 

00:07:45
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, of we look across different settings, where do youth get expose to violence? We know that there are no conclusive findings on this, in fact our literature does not tell us very much today. However, our-- some emerging data tells us that, ah, in fact, uhm, peers are very influential, ah, in terms of violence exposure in schools, ah, at home, of course we know that, ah, relationships with caretakers become essential and in the community we know that community violence not just what happens at home or directly at school but broader community violence, witnessing violence just the feeling of the lack of safety is associated with all kinds of mental health, uhm, issues as well. 

00:08:30
The ROLE OF ETHNIC IDENTITY (EI) • Definition: Sense of belonging to one's ethnic group • Associated with psychological well-being of ethnic and racial minorities • Moderate research support for El as a protective factor • Sense of ethnic identity may moderate the mental health relationship among racial minority youth 

00:08:30
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, I became very interested in the issue of ethnic identity as well because I felt that, if we were looking at, uhm, issues of violence that we really also need to think about-- well, how do kids identify in other ways? What else is going on? And are there certain protective factors potentially that could, ah, influence the impact of violence exposure on mental health. So this is a developmental factor that I was interested in looking at and ethnic identity refers to a sense of belonging with one's group very generally their-- this is a very complicated construct in our field. We see-- now see this is a multi-dimensional, ah, construct. There's also some mixed findings, ah, related to how-- whether or not ethnic identity is a protective factor in the context of discrimination, uhm, and exposure to discrimination and very little has been done in terms of exposure to violence as the context for understanding ethnic identity. 

00:09:25
AIMS OF THE STUDY • To examine the relationship between ETV in home/community and school settings and mental health outcomes (post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety) • To explore whether a stronger ethnic identity reduces the negative impact of violence exposure on mental health outcomes • To examine whether help-seeking (talking with family, friends, and adults in school) would reduce the negative effects of violence exposure on mental health outcomes METHODS • Procedure • Measures Exposure to Violence and 

00:09:30
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA So this particular study aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to violence and multiple settings, there was the home community as well as school settings and looking at several mental health outcomes-- post-traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms. Uhm, and also to see whether a stronger ethnic identity reduces the negative impact of violence exposure on mental health outcomes. And to see whether or not help-seeking like talking to family or friends or, uhm, adults in the school environment in particular would reduce these negative effects of violence exposure. I won't go through all of these slides, there's a lot to say. If you're interested in the specific, I'm more than happy to talk with you but I'm more interested in kind of imparting the, the general findings, uhm, for our discussion. But we had-- ah, just generally we had 522, ninth and 10th grade students, uhm, about half and half sort of, ah, with boys and five transgendered students who identified as transgendered. Uhm, you can see that close to 60% of our participants reduce free or reduce cost meals at school we don't-- we didn't have a great measure that we use in the study for socioeconomic, ah, status. However, this was, this was considered one such indicator. You can see this was a fairly diverse, uhm, group of kids in terms of cultural background, racial backgrounds, uhm, and then the list of measures here. Again, if you're interested, ah, in the details, I'm happy to go over this with you. 

00:11:00
RESULTS • Majority of participants reported exposure to violence at home and community (83.3%). and exposure to violence at school (95.6%). • Girls reported significantly higher exposure to violence at home/community than boys. • No significant differences in ETV across SES 32.8% reported that they never talked with anyone after being exposed to violence. • Out of those who did seek help, 70.7% never talked with a teacher or counselor after being exposed to violence, and 49.6% never talked with an adult at home. 

00:11:00
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so when we just looked at, we didn't start our regression analysis and all of that, but we just looked at who are participants were and what they said about violence exposure in general. And this is what we found that the majority of the participants, 83.3% reported exposure to violence at home and community and exposure to violence at school 95.6%. So this is a staggering number, really. Uhm, girls tended to report significantly higher exposure to violence at home and community than boys. So we start to see these different patterns across gender, uhm, and no significant differences actually across SES as measured by this one indicator, ah, and of course there are limitations to that. We also saw that almost a third reported that they never talked to anybody after being exposed to some form of violence. So the violence-- the types of violence these kids were, uhm, being expose to varied anywhere from, uhm, being hit at home, uhm, or to watching somebody getting killed in their neighborhood or to, uhm, acts of bullying and physical harassment in school. So this was quite a lar-- ah, quite a wide-range. Now, out of those who did seek help, uhm, you can see the majority never talked to a teacher or counselor after being exposed to violence. Uhm, almost half never talked with an adult at home. So what we see is, ah, already a pattern of, uhm, isolation that accompanies this violence exposure. 

00:12:30
RESULTS • Exposure to violence at home/community and school associated with post-traumatic stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms • Association between exposure to violence and post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms stronger for girls than boys • Ethnic identity has a buffering role against mental health symptoms in the context of violence exposure at school for White. Asian, and Multiracial adolescents, but not for Latino/a and African American adolescents • Help-seeking did not moderate relationship between ETV and mental health symptoms 

00:12:35
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, we also found here that the exposure to violence, not surprisingly, uhm, in multiple context was associated with mental health outcomes. Uhm, and so the association between the exposure to violence and post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms was stronger for boys-- I'm sorry, stronger for girls than for boys. Also not as that surprising given that we typically find that girl's report symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression, ah, into a greater degree than boys do. Uhm, ethnic identity seemed to have a buffering role against, ah, mental health syn-- symptoms but for subgroups not across everybody, uhm, but specifically for the White participants, Asian and Multiracial participants, not for Latino and African-American adolescents. So, one of the things that we found in our studies that we needed to-- and this was one of our first studies and we wanted to see how violence exposure, how ethnic identity really seemed to vary across groups and oftentimes these kids as you know in school environments are sort of cool together, as though that they common experiences and in fact they don't. And as you'll see when I present the qualitative findings, you'll see the distinctions among these, ah, factors even more. Also, another sobering thing that we found was the help-seeking did not seem to help, ah, in this relationship either. Uhm, and you know, we did not measure, however the extent to which kids found help-seeking helpful in a sense, so when you actually reached out to somebody, who were you reaching out to and, you know, how helpful was that. 

00:14:15
IMPLICATIONS • Discrepancy between mental health needs and low likelihood of adolescents' discussions of traumatic exposure with adults at school and at home • Need to examine pathways to seeking help • Differential effects of ethnic identity across racial and ethnic groups • Need to further examine the role of ethnic identity and race in exposure to violence and mental health STUDY 2: DISCRIMINATION AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG IMMIGRANT-ORIGIN YOUTH Tummala-Narra & Claudius, 2013 SETTING THE CONTEXT • Immigrant youth account for a significant portion of the 75 million children in the U.S. (Passel, 2011) • Most ethnically and racially diverse in U.S. history • Increasing numbers of Latino/a, Asian, Afro-Caribbean first and second generation youth • Rising rates of mental health concerns and underutilization of mental health services among foreign-born and later generations of immigrant-origin youth (Sirin et al., 2012) 

00:14:15
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so from this particular study, we felt the need to look more closely at the pathways to seeking help, the dis-- dis-- discrepancy between the mental health needs and the low likelihood of seeking help of talking to people in the school or outside of the school. And the need to look within subgroups as I had mentioned. Uhm, so we decided to look at a smaller subgroup of, uhm, kids next and this was, ah, a study that was, uhm, that included 95 kids who were of immigrant-origin background and we wanted to look more closely at this particular subgroup next, ah, before doing our qualitative study. Uhm, again a little background on immigrant youth, we know that, ah, in United States today that about a quarter of our children in the U.S. are of immigrant-origin so they are either first or second generation. And, uhm, so this is about 18.7 million kids in the United States. This is also the time in United States that's, ah, most ethnically and racially diverse, ah, ah, in our history particularly increasing numbers of Latino, Asian, and Afro-Caribbean youth. There's also an-- the underutilization of mental health services for not just the first or the-- ah, foreign-born immigrant group but also for the second generation and later generations of youth. 

00:15:40
WHY FOCUS ON DISCRIMINATION? • Deleterious effects on physical and psychological well-being among immigrant groups (e.g., Flores et al., 2010) • 30..90% of youth report experiences of discrimination • Adolescence critical period as youth explore their identities & are increasingly sensitive to others' perception • Ethnic minority youth level of stereotyping and discrimination report more depressive symptoms (e.g., Greete el al., 2006) • Negative and positive stereotyping can contribute to psychological distress (e.g., APA, 2012) Model minority stereotype can contribute to academic/occupational stress AIMS • To examine the relationship between perceived discrimination (by adults and peers) and depressive symptoms among immigrant-origin adolescents in an urban school • To investigate if this relationship varies across gender and nativity status (foreign-born vs. U.S. born) • To explore whether ethnic identity and social support play a protective role against the negative effects of perceived discrimination PARTICIPANTS - N=95 (49 foreign-born, 46 U.S. born) - Age: 13- 19 years (M=15.07; SD=1.09) - Gender: 51 male and 44 female - 38.9% Afro/Caribbean; 30.5% Latino/Latina; 23.2% Asian, South Asian, Pacific Islander; 7.4 % Multiracial 

00:15:40
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA So, why look at discrimination? I think we all know in this room that the problems that, uhm, discrimination poses, ah, on physical and mental health outcomes, particularly overtime accumulative experiences of discrimination. So, in this study we wanted to look at the, ah, relationship between perceived discrimination but we wanted to look at discrimination by adults and by peers separately. And we wanted to see if this was associated with depressive symptoms among immigrant-origin adolescents and we wanted to see if there were differences across nativity status in particular, ah, and specifically foreign-born and U.S. born. And also again, to look at ethnic identity and social support, do they play a role in, uhm, protecting against discrimination and mental health. So this was a smaller samples size here, ah, we had 95 students, uhm, you-- the majority of whom were between 13 and, ah, 16 years of age, uhm, 51 male, 44 female and you'll see the racial, ah, ethnic backgrounds here. 

00:16:50
MEASURES Background Demographic Form - Depression: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-DC) Sample peer: "I felt down and unhappy." - Discrimination: Way and Colleagues (-Drake et al., 2001) - Sample there: "Other students in school treat you like a trouble maker because of your race or ethnicity." Ethnic Identity: Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM, 1992) Sample peers: "I think a lot about how my own life will be affected by my ethnic group membership." Social Support: Finding for Justice Survey (FJS et al., 2270) Sample peers: "When you are going through a hard time, how often do you sure to adult family members?'(D=22) PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS • 75.8% of youth reported at least one incident of racial/ethnic discrimination by peers • 63.2% of youth reported at least one incident of racial/ethnic discrimination by adults • Average scores for depressive symptoms were low (M=92, SD= 50) • Moderately high levels of ethnic identity (M=2.99, SD= .50) • Low levels of social support (M=1.90, SD=.59) REGRESSION MODELS: ADULT DISCRIMINATION • Gender was a predictor for depressive symptoms with boys reporting fewer depressive symptoms when compared to girls (b=.25, p<.01) • Two interaction effects: • Effect of perceived adult discrimination and depressive symptoms was moderated by nativity status • Lower effect for foreign born youth (b=-1.97, p greater than 01) • Effect of perceived adult discrimination and depressive symptoms was moderated by ethnic identity • Higher effect for youth with lower ethnic identity scores ( 1.30, p<.05) 

00:16:50
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA And we use several measures. Again, I won't go this in depth but, ah, on depressive symptoms discrimination, separate scale for peers and adults and, uhm, ethnic identity and social support. Uhm, so this was what we started to see in, in our preliminary-- in our-- without preliminary findings. Uhm, over three-fourths of our youth in this particular study reported at least one incident of racial and ethnic, ah, discrimination by peers. And remember that these are still primarily ninth and 10th graders. Uhm, 63.2% of the youth reported at least one incident of racial and ethnic discrimination by adults and by adults they are talking about adults in the school. Uhm, the average scores for depressive symptoms were quite low, uhm, and then you can see that moderate levels for ethnic identity and pretty low levels of social support. So let's look at adult discrimination first. Uhm, gender seemed to be a predictor for depressive symptoms with boys reporting fewer depressive symptoms than girls similar to the pre-- ah, to the previous study. We also found that the effect of perceived adult discrimination and depressive symptoms was moderated by nativity status so that there was a lower effect of this, uhm, on foreign-born youth as compared to U.S. born youth. And then the effect of adult discrimination and depressive symptoms was moderated by ethnic identity. There was a definite, uhm, difference between, ah, youth with lower ethnic identity scores the these youths seemed to have a, a, a heightened, ah, effect in, in terms of the relationship between discrimination and depressive symptoms. So it seems that i-- ethnic identity did in fact in this particular study seemed to be a protective factor. 

00:18:40
REGRESSION MODELS: PEER DISCRIMINATION • Gender was related to depressive symptoms, with boys reporting lower levels of depressive symptomatology than girls (b=1.23, p<.05) • Lower levels of depressive symptomatology among youth with stronger ethnic identity (b=-.31, p<.01) • Interaction Effects • Effect of peer discrimination was stronger for U.S. born participants than foreign-born participants (b=-1.31, p<.05) DISCRIMINATION FINAL REGRESSION MODELS: ADULTS AND PEERS CONTEXT MATTERS: GENDER & NATIVITY • Both boys and girls may be vulnerable to depression in the context of race/ethnicity-based discrimination, although girls reported more depressive symptoms than boys • Both foreign-born and U.S. born groups reported experiences of discrimination by adults and peers at school • However, the discrimination-depression trajectory was significant for U.S. born youth only 

00:18:40
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, with peer discrimination. Gender was related to depressive symptoms again, uhm, similar pattern between boys and girls. Lower levels of depressive symptoms among youth, ah, were associated with a stronger ethnic identity. Uhm, and then we have those interaction effect. The effect of peer discrimination was stronger for U.S. born participants than it was for foreign-born participants. So you'll see the effects here in this, uhm, graph, in this, ah, table here. So what we learned from this is that in fact both boys and girls are vulnerable to the negative effects of discrimination on mental health outcomes, specifically depressive symptoms. However-- and then we also see by the way that it was both the foreign-born students and the U.S. born students who had report negative experiences of discrimination by both adults and peers. However, the discrimination-depression trajectory was significant for U.S. born youth only. 

00:19:40
ETHNIC IDENTITY: MIXED FINDINGS • For U.S. born participants, ethnic identity mitigated the negative effects of perceived discrimination by adults • Specifically, for U.S. born youth with low or average ethnic identity, discrimination was related to depressive symptoms • U.S. born youth with lower levels of EI may be especially vulnerable to levels of depression • Immigrant Paradox SOCIAL SUPPORT • Social support was not associated with depressive symptoms and was not a moderator in the discrimination-depression trajectory • May sense a coping function but may not offset stress related to discrimination (Ajrouch et al., 2010, Grossman & Liang, 2008) • Foreign-born youth reported higher levels of perceived social support • Youth from different immigrant generations may turn to different sources for support 

00:19:45
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, ethnic identity, also seemed to play a protective role but specifically for U.S. born youth in the low or average ethnic identity range discrimination was related to depressive symptoms. And U.S. born youth with lower levels of ethnic identity might be particularly, ah, vulnerable to, ah, depressive symptoms. So this brings up the question of immigrant paradox, right, the idea that in fact the longer you stay in the United States, uhm, that the worse your mental health outcomes will be, so that the second generation as compared to the first generation seems to do worse. Uhm, and so this is a, a pa-- this is a kind of a pattern that we also saw in these, uhm, series of studies. Uhm, with social support. Surprisingly was not associated with depressive symptoms, was not a moderator in this relationship. So, we came away with this thinking that, in fact this could be a coping function be-- may not offset the stress that comes with discrimination in the same way that we might expect with other types of stressors and any-- ani-- ah, child's life or in adolescent's life. Interestingly, the foreign-born group reported higher levels of perceived social support than, uhm, than the group, ah, that was U.S. born. And so we wondered further about what does it mean to be U.S. born-- foreign-born, uhm, youth growing up in United States and what are the dynamics of being in a school life this like. So, all of these led us to think that we needed to just talk to the kids more and so, uhm, we decided to setup a series of group interviews. 

00:21:15
Immigrant-origin adolescents' experiences of race and ethnicity: A group interview analysis Tummala-Narra & Sathasivam-Rueckert in progress THE PRESENT STUDY • The present study aimed to explore how adolescents experience themselves as either immigrants or as children of immigrants, and as racial minorities, across multiple contexts. • The processes through with immigrant-origin adolescents develop their identities of racial minority status and immigrant background were examined. METHOD • Participants • 64 adolescents at a high school located in an urban area of Northeastern United States • 35 girls and 29 boys • Ages ranged from 14 to 20 years (M=15 SB;SD=1.29) • Group interviews were completed with three sets of Asian American adolescents (n=19), three sets of Haitian American adolescents (n=18), three sets of Latino/a adolescents (n=17) and two sets of South Asian adolescents (n=10). • Forty-four adolescents were born outside of the United States and 20 were born in the U.S. 

00:21:15
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA And, uhm, and specifically we focused on immigrant-origin adolescents since this was the majority of, uhm, the kids who were attending this particular school. And we wanted to learn more about their particular experiences of race and ethnicity and what it was like to be a person of their particular racial and ethnic background in the school and in their broader life outside of school, as well. So what we wanted to do then is to think and this was whether you were an immigrant yourself or you were a child of an immigrant. Uhm, and what kinds of processes were involved in identity development? So we were interested in these particular issues. Ah, we had 64, uhm, adolescents at this high school, same high school, 35 girls and 29 boys who participated in our group interviews. And we decided to separate, uhm, these kids into groups where they identify with a particular racial background and these were all kids who self-identified, uhm, as either, uhm, Asian-American, South Asian American, Latino-American, Haitian-American. And so we had, uhm, as-- various sets of these groups, uhm, and we met with each of these groups twice in consecutive weeks, we gave them pizza and, uhm, made this as informal as possible during study whole period or after school. Uhm, and you'll see that this was, ah, that we had 44 of these adolescents born outside the U.S. and 20 who are born in the U.S. 

00:22:50
METHOD • Group • Each group participants met twice to complete the group interview. • The number of participants in each group ranged from four to eight. • Each group interviews lasted approximately 40 to 60 minutes in length. • Mapping exercise 

00:22:50
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, the number of participants in each groups range from four to eight and each interview this lasted between 40 and 60 minutes in length. We also, uhm, did-- we also began the actual group, the first group with a mapping exercise and this was a way to just sort of, it was an icebreaker in a way, but it was also a way just, uhm, got kids to begin, to think about their identities. So we drew a circle that facilitator-- by the way, the, the facilitators, uhm, the, ah, worked as a pair in each of these group interviews and these were students who-- graduate students from Boston College who conducted these group interviews. And what the facilitator would do is just draw a circle and inside write, "I am" and the kids would then draw lines and write down whatever they felt they were or whoever they felt they were in that moment, And so here, you'll see all kinds of descriptors-- I'm awesome, I'm old, ah, lavender, sophomore, Vietnamese, uhm, you see one up above that says, FOB which is fresh off the boat. So all kinds of-- and then you'll see another one that says, token so all kinds of things. So each group began with this exercise. 

00:24:05
SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS • Interview One • Please think of a time when you have felt good about being a young person from your particular ethnic and/or racial background. • Can you think of a specific event or something that happened that caused you to feel this way? • Please think of a time when it's felt hard to be a young person from your ethnic and/or racial background. • Can you think of a specific event or something that happened that caused you to feel this way? • How did you deal with it? • Have you ever been treated unfairly because of your background? • What was this like for you? • How did you deal with it? 

00:24:05
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA And then we proceeded onto the interview. And by the way, at the end of the second interview, we did another, ah, similar mapping exercise where there was a circle, we drew in "We are", so that this became a group identity, uhm, kind of chart that we, ah, ended up the activity or that particular interview with. So, uhm, I walk over all the interview questions of course, but I will just say briefly that, uhm, the first interview was really mantic, ah, capture and think about-- help the kids think about what they felt good about in terms of their particular racial or ethnic background, but also what felt hard about it, what was difficult about it, and, and to ask to them specifically-- think of an event, specific event that made you feel that way or that caused you to feel that way or something that happens so that we can get descriptors. Because you can imagine sitting in a group of, ah, ninth and 10th grade students who-- and just asking them open-ended questions really it, it would not work well. Uhm, so we really need to-- and oftentimes the facilitators would self-disclose and talk about their own experiences as well as a way to facilitate trust. Uhm, also questions about whether or not they've been treated unfairly in some way, because of their background. 

00:25:20
SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS • Interview Two • Last time that we met, we talked about you experiences of being a young Asian or Asian American, and some things that feel positive and some things that feel hard about being Asian or Asian American. This week, we will focus on how you try to deal with the stressful part of your experience. • What helps you when you feel stressed (such as feeling sad or worried)? • Do you talk to anyone about what is upsetting you? • Who are they? • What do you think helps young Asian Americans' in your school and/or community outside of school cope with stress? Racial and ethnic RESULTS • Conventional content analysis (Hamish & Shannon, 20050; • Four major domains related to identity development emerged from data analysis. • Pride in and connection with heritage culture and language • Difficulties in cultural adjustment • Stereotypes and discrimination • Coping and relational contexts 

00:25:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Then the second interview focused on coping and how they cope with stress that was related to the events that they described in the first interview. Uhm, so the general-- the results, uhm, that you'll see up here shortly, uhm, there were four general domains that emerge out of this data, ah, the following and I'll go into a little bit more detail about each one of them. First had to deal with a sense of pride, connection with the heritage culture and, and language in particular. The second had to do with difficulties in cultural adjustment and then stereotypes and discrimination, coping and relational context. These were the overlapping kinds of, ah, teams, domains and teams that emerged across all of these groups. However, when we get to stereotypes and discrimination, I'll talk a little bit about how they were quite distinct across each of these groups, across the, ah, different, ah, racial groups. 

00:26:20
PARTICIPANT QUOTES: PRIDE • Pride in one's heritage culture and/or community • I was born in China. I'm very proud that Chinese have more than 5,000 years of history and culture and very rich and inspirational to the present generation... I'm pretty proud to talk about that and say that I'm Chinese. (Chinese American participant) PARTICIPANT QUOTES: DIFFICULTIES WITH ACCULTURATION • Barriers associated with learning English • I didn't have enough friends when I first moved here because I was different from them. I didn't know any English so I couldn't communicate to my classmates. (Indian American participant) • Intergenerational conflicts in the family • They're really strict. Haitian parents are strict. I just want to have American parents sometimes because it would be easier. (Haitian American participant) 

00:26:20
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA So first, uhm, there's an example of pride in one's heritage culture or community, uhm, this participant says, I'm, I'm-- I was born in China. I'm very proud that Chinese have more than 5,000 years of history and culture and very rich and inspirational to the present generations. I'm pretty proud to talk about that and say that I'm Chinese. Uhm, we also had our, our participants talk about the challenges associated with English. I didn't have enough friends when I first moved here because I was different from them. I didn't know any English so I couldn't communicate to my classmates. Uhm, intergenerational conflicts in the family as another stressor in acculturation. And so this is a Haitian American participant who said, "They're really strict. Haitian parents are strict. I just wanna have American parents sometimes because it would be easier." 

00:27:10
PARTICIPANTS QUOTES: STEREOTYPES • Stereotypes related to positive and negative characteristics • When we hear about Latinos it is, "They work really hard in the garden," and things like that. (El Salvadoran American participant) • The stereotype goes all Asians are smart. But, to be honest, I'm not really that smart. I just work really hard. I try really hard and try to get everything done, but then I don't like it because they assume that I'm smart. (Chinese American participant) 

00:27:15
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, and then we have this very distinct stereotypes. Stereotypes related to both what we consider positive and negative characteristics. Uhm, the first quote that you see here. When we hear about Latinas it is, "They work really hard in the garden," and things like that. Now this is-- this particular participant, ah, reveals one type of stereotype about Latinos but some of our other kids in the groups talked about a contradictory stereotype. On one hand, Latinos work really hard but on the other hand, they would also hear the stereotype that Latinos are lazy. So this was a common theme that took, you know, that sort of kept coming up and all of the group interviews that they could, they could, ah, verbalize how confusing all of this was. So which one am I and when am I which? Uhm, and then you see other stereotype here, this is the model minority met of course, uhm, or the stereotype. "The stereotype goes all Asians are smart. But, to be honest, I'm not really that smart. I just work really hard. I try really hard and try to get everything done, but then I don't like it because they assume that I'm smart." This is a Chinese American participant. 

00:28:20
PARTICIPANTS QUOTES: DISCRIMINATION • Experiences of discrimination • Like I didn't get bullied, but I got teased by my friends a lot and like ...when Osama died, they would say, "Oh, your uncle died." • One teacher always be rushing on the Haitians. She'll be like, "You are all too loud. You Haitians are weird." (American participant) • They always say, "If you get on my nerves, I'm gonna deport your whole family... I'll call immigration on you."(Guatemalan American participant who speaks English fluently) 

00:28:20
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, and then here's some examples of experiences of discrimination. Ah, it's a Pakistani American participant who said, like I didn't get bullied, but I got teased by my friends a lot and like when Osama died, they would say, "Oh, your uncle died." One teacher always be rushing on the Haitians. She'll be like, "You are all too loud. You Haitians are weird." Sadly, we heard this many times over in terms of teachers or adults in the school making comments like this, this was not a sole incident by any means. Uhm, in fact there was an adult, uhm, the, the third quote that you see here refers to an adult making this comment. "If you get on my nerves, I'm gonna deport your whole family, I'll call immigration on you." And this is by a Guatemalan American participant who speaks English fluently. And it, ah, by the way, this last quote that you see here was proceeded by another comment relating to language fluency and making the assumption that this participant didn't know any English. 

00:29:25
PARTICIPANT QUOTES: COPING • Talking with peers • When you talk to friends, you get a different perspective. Or you may think something is so serious and so bad, and you talk to someone and you see it is really not that big of a deal. (Haitian American participant) • I know if I was in school and I had a problem I wouldn't know which teacher to go talk to. I can't relate to any of them. (Indian American participant) • I hate when they (guidance counselors) say that when they will keep it private but them they tell all the teachers. (Haitian American participant) 

00:29:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so we moved to this domain around coping, uhm, finally and, uhm, this was very interesting to us because we were really interested in learning about how kids dealt with all of this on an ongoing basis. Uhm, talking with peers. When you talk to friends, you get a different perspective. Or you may think something as so serious and so bad, and you talk to someone and see it's really not that big of a deal. So this kind of informal seeking support from friends seemed to be common among the kids. In fact, that was the most popular way that they dealt with their issues. Uhm, talking with adults at school. I know if I was in school and I had a problem I wouldn't know which teacher to go talk to. I can't relate to any of them. So this is an important, uhm-- I just wanna point out that many of the students would talk about not knowing what was available to them in the school. There was a real discrepancy between what the, uhm, guidance, ah, personnel and other people, the administration thought was available and knew was available about the school. And what the kids actually were aware of, they did not know that they could actually talked to anybody. Uhm, ah, then you see-- they didn't know there was a guidance counselor however, and you'll see though what-- one of them says, one of the kid says, "I hate that when guidance counselors say that when they'll keep it private but them they tell all the other teachers." So this was also a common concern around privacy issues. 

00:30:50
PARTICIPANT QUOTES: COPING • Taking with family members • I think because you do not want your parents to get worried about you and concerned about you. So, most kids like to keep hiding. I mostly do not tell my parents how I feel, I just put it on to my journal and just let it be. (Vietnamese American participant)• I talk to my sister, like if I get in trouble...Because my parents will just start yelling and stuff. My sister just listens, talks back to me, and then goes back to our parents.(Nepalese American participant) 

00:30:50
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, talking with family members. There was a real sense of not wanting to burden family members, especially parents. However, uhm, also finding ways to talk to pa-- possibly siblings or other people in the family. I think because you do not want your parents to get worried about you and concerned about you. So, most kids like to keep hiding. I mostly do not tell my parents how I feel, I just put it down on my journal and just let it be. All right. I talk to my sister, like if I get in trouble because my parents will just start yelling and stuff. My sister just listens, talks back to me, and then goes back to our parents. 

00:31:25
DISCUSSION Immigrant-origin youth engage in developing a hybrid identity. • The formation of this identity relies on relational contexts and processes, whereby adolescents develop their identity through interactions with others. • Challenges to hybrid identity • Informal sources of support 

00:31:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so there are few things that we have learned, uhm, particularly from this last study that I presented, just hearing from kids themselves about their stories and their they were incredibly courageous. I have to say, they talk to us about this, about these feelings that they had and these experiences. Uhm, but one thing was very clear that are-- these kids wanted to, uhm, be a part of multiple different context. There was a real desire to develop a hybrid sense of self, a hybrid sense of identity, where they did not want to be only seen as someone who was Nepalese or someone who was Chinese or someone who was Haitian, but rather they were interested in being American as well. Whatever that meant to them. So that's kind of, ah, shifting back and forth between context, they felt it was very important and they wanted to be a part of it and they wanted to be seen by others as such. And the importance of, uhm, seeking help foreign friends. 

00:32:25
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM STUDENTS • Recommended a "Culture Fair": Collaboration with students, teachers, and head of guidance • Participants suggested that they would benefit from regular discussions about stereotyping and identity in a group format with their peers. FOLLOW UP PEER MENTORING PROJECT • The aim of this project was: • To facilitate dialogue concerning discrimination, racism and stereotyping • To highlight narratives concerning race and identity • To explore group process among racial minority adolescents • Created B-week-long peer-mentoring program • Students met weekly for about an hour to talk about discrimination, stereotyping and identity during an independent study period. • Each group consisted of 5-7 high school students and 2 BC graduate students. • Attended to the interpersonal dynamics of group dialogue concerning race, ethnicity and discrimination. 

00:32:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA They also made a number of great recommendations to us which we did follow through it. One had to do with a culture fair. One of the things we heard from all of the groups was, you know, we're tired of people just looking at us as though we're a problem, uhm, as though the-- that, you know, we are only about being discriminated against or stereotype against, but in fact we have a like a real culture that we're a part of and we want people to see that. And nobody actually sees that, they only see this kind of visible, physical difference between us. And we want them to see what we actually, uhm, you know, come with in terms of our cultural background. So this-- we developed a week-long, uhm, series of events called the culture affair and, uhm, it wasn't just involving food from different countries, which, you know, it's a typical culture affair that you'll see in, in schools beginning from elementary school onward. But rather this was, uhm, this was a series involved, a series of panels, uhm, bet-- with various, uhm, adults as well as, uhm, students in the school to have a conversation about their identities and all of the different dimensions of identities that they wanted to talk about. And in fact it was interesting because many of the teachers talked about their identities that the students were never, you know, did-- were not aware of either. Uhm, they also, ah, told us that they would benefit from regular discussions if they actually had no place, that they talked about this stuff around stereotypes and discrimination, it wanted ongoing groups. And so we did actually implement a, ah, peer mentoring, uhm, project th-- these were 8-week long groups where our BC students would go and facilitate a dialogue and race, ethnicities, stereotyping and dial-- and just open dialogue. Uhm, I won't go in to the details of this however, I will just say that one of the most important things that's come out of this is, uhm, is just the opportunity to create spaces where kids can actually have a discussion with kids for-- and this was not limited, it was not done in the same way as the, the group interviews in the previous research in that, these were kids from various different ethnic and racial backgrounds having that conversations with each other using a lot of activities, like the mapping exercise I mentioned, identity kinds of exercises and finding ways to begin to talk about their experiences. Uhm, and a lot of attending to interpersonal dynamics between the group, ah, between the students in the group as well as the facilitators and the students. 

00:35:05
FUTURE DIRECTIONS • Transmitting narrative: Video project • Creating safe spaces and developing a culture of dialogue that is collaborative • Building dialogue across parents, students, and school personnel on issues of violence and mental health • Research addressing the heterogeneity among racial minority and immigrant-origin adolescents and implications for mental health and access to appropriate care and resources 

00:35:10
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so there-- a couple of things I'll just say, before I got to-- oh, I just shutdown everything. Okay. Here we go. Uhm, so just a couple of things that came, the last thing, I will say that most recent thing that came out of this video or this particular project of the peer mentoring, uhm, groups is a video projects, so the kids and the peer mentoring groups, ah, and there were several of these peer mentoring groups that took place over of course of 2 years. And they wanted to create a project, a, a, ah, a tool, uhm, where they can talk about their identities to share with their school. They wanted to be used it-- used as a, ah, method of communicating what they were experiencing but also, uhm, for dialogue and so they wanted the adults in the school to have a permanent kind of, uhm, product that they could refer to with relation to their experiences. So they-- ah, we had a, ah, BC student who was actually, a graduate of this particular high school, who helped us videotaped this whole, uhm, series of dialogues that the students put together in the high school. Interestingly, uhm, the school-- we had an ambivalent relationship around us with the school, not surprisingly because I think the administrators and many of the teachers felt that in fact, their experiences were quite different than what that students were reporting. And so we ended up, uhm, completing this video handing it to the school administration and there was a long period of silence around it. And so we're still working through this process and I just, I just wanna share that with you because I think implementing this by it's-- by no means an, an easy smooth process and we've a lot of, uhm, kinds of negotiations around this-- both within our own research group with the students and teachers at the school and the administration so I just wanna, uhm, put that out there as well. But there are many other ideas as you can see on this slide that we're working on at the moment. 

00:37:10
QUESTIONS? 

00:37:10
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, so let me end with that and just leave it open for any questions or thoughts, reactions that you all may have. 

00:37:25
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Uhm, we actually did not see a difference in terms of the level of discrimination that was reported by the first, ah, generation versus the second or the U.S. born versus the foreign-born group, but we did see that it, it seems to have made a difference in terms of its impact, you know. But in terms of just the degree, no we did not see any difference and no statistical difference, right. 

00:37:50
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA I really respect the fact that the school is so under resourced around us and, uhm, that it's very hard for them to had time and part of the reason we-- this was something we were able to provide as function of our grant from our school, that we were able to do this, but it would be of course much better if this could happen internally within the school. Uhm, in terms of, you know, we did actually conduct a series of focused groups with teachers and guidance staff separately-- actually very in the early on in the work and even before we did these groups and, uhm, we ask them about how they thought that, uhm, they, they were doing as a school community as, as the adults in the school in terms of dealing with issues around discrimination, uhm, how is diversity approached in, in the school that is highly diverse, ah, in terms of, ah, race, ethnicity, immigration, uhm, and in fact they, they actually felt that they were doing quite well with it. So their perception of it was very different than what the students were telling us and we did not-- we really learn that through a course of time. But I think that they felt-- they really felt that they were invested in learning about their students. Now, we could have gotten a self-selected group of teachers who were actually interested in that and, and the, the students actually did tell us that there's, there's some variation in the teachers. It's not that uniformly, everybody was like this but there were enough adults in the school that were stressful to them at the same time. And I think for the guidance staff this becomes very complicated because how do you start to make those distinctions, uhm, and particularly when you're not hearing all of the stories from the kids. They feel like they can't go and tell somebody because structurally there isn't anything in the school that promotes that kind of reaching out. 

00:39:40
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA When we began our introduction of the focused groups, uhm, we did, uhm, we did inform the kids that there are certain things that we won't have to report so that I know that there were certain things they were not telling us as a function of that. But they weren't aware of that, uhm, we-- interestingly, in the first study you saw the, uhm, the high numbers of the high percentages that we saw of exposure to violence and all the while have been sharing these findings with the school, so it's as though I sort of keep it in my office and in a journal but, you know, this was supposed to be part-- meant to be a part of this dialogue between ourselves and the school. And one of the things that, uhm, the school administrator side is, ah, is to, you know, devo-- do something-- they wanted to do something about this and so we offered to do a training on, uhm, trauma in particular. And so and, ah, however, overtime they found it unmanageable because they worried about the liability issue and the reporting issue that it's overwhelming. And so we've has this-- we continue to have a back and forth dialogue around this with the school even today, so, you know, we're stuck with this issue but you bring up a very important point. But the students themselves in the groups were aware of that. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN One of the findings potentially being that racial identity was a buffering variable or, uhm, a moderator for certain race ethnicities but not for others, so I think it was-- maybe White European American, Asian, Asian American and maybe not for African-American and maybe Latina, Latino did, uhm-- do you have any thoughts about why that might have been the case? 

00:41:15
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA Yeah, uhm, so we didn't so much at the end of that study but-- and it was ethnic identity we were looking at specifically, uhm, and howev-- that's what sort of led us to want to talk to these kids more and what we've noticed one, one hypothesis is that, uhm, when we heard the specific types of stereotypes and the specific types of discrimination that the kids who are Latino and African-American were experiencing versus the kids who are multiracial and Asian were experiencing and White were experiencing both in the focused groups and the peer mentoring project that we did after that. Uhm, what we found was that in fact, uhm, these stereotypes and the types of discrimination were so harsh and so negative. And, ah, you know, in fact they would tell us sometimes we stay away from each other in the school as a way of deflecting the attention on us, you know. Some of the Haitian kids would say that they wouldn't talked to the-- that these were the Haitian American second generation kids. And they would say we stay away from the Haitian kids who just arrived to the U.S. more recently because we don't wanna be associated with them because then we get seen as though we're not American. So there are a lot of these dynamics going on within groups, uhm, be-- and they-- I would say uniformly the, uhm, Haitian American students would tell us over and over again that they never received a positive stereotype or an ambivalent stereotype, they were harshly negative. And that they were not-- they were lazy, they were not smart, they were not gonna do well over and over again. So I think that having-- possibly having the stronger ethnic identity in the school context might have some different implications under those conditions then for other groups. So that's one idea that we've been thinking about. 

00:43:05
USHA TUMMALA-NARRA We didn't in the focused groups and in the peer mentoring projects, it wasn't specifically focused on the different types of violence. Uhm, in the measures that we used in the first study on violence exposure, we were mindful of the fact that violence can sor-- you know, abuse in particular, can be defined in many different ways across cultural context and so we use a measure that really just laid out very concretely did this particular action or event happen. And so we try to delineated that way-- if there were topics around violent exposure that came up certainly during the, ah, group interviews, uhm, in the peer mentoring, ah, project as well. Uhm, but nothing specific and they knew that, you know, I think they were aware that we could-- they really couldn't talk about violence at home in particular because of the mandi-- the mandatory reporting, uhm, that, that would happen. So I'm, I'm very sure of that. Thank you all very much. I appreciate your time.
