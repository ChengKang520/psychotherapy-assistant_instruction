Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 www.emicrotraining.com info@emicrotraining.com Copyright 2004 Microtraining Associates Presents An Asian American Story Life Review with Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. Interview by Madonna G. Constantine, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Hello. My name is Madonna Constantine and I'm a professor of Psychology and Education in the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University. I'm here with Dr. Derald Wing Sue, who's also a professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College in the Counseling Psychology Program. Dr. Derald Wing Sue, as many of you know, is one of the notable psychologist within the 20th and the 21st centuries. And in fact, he's someone who can claim both national and international fame. He's easily the most influential multicultural scholar of our time. He's certainly the most frequently scho, cited multicultural scholar. And I wanna say a little bit about Dr. Sue's background. Dr. Sue received his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology in 1969 from the University of Oregon. He came to Teachers College after retiring from California State University, ah, at Hayward where he worked for almost 30 years as an educator and a scholar. He also, ah, while in California, served as a member of the faculty of the California School of Professional Psychology. In terms of my own development as a counseling psychologist, Dr. Sue has been incredibly influential. I viewed his scholarship, his service to the profession, his collegiality and friendship as important mechanisms through which I've grown as a scholar and as a psychologist. It's an honor for me to conduct a life interview with him, which is what the purpose of this videotape is, is about. And in this life review we're going to use Erik Erikson's developmental theory and framework as a way of illuminating, ah, salient life issues that Dr. Sue has experienced and certain processes that have affected his, his life. Before starting the interview, however, I'd like to say that I'm very cognizant of both the strengths and the limitations of Erik Erikson's developmental theory. Ah, particular limitations that I'd like to note include, it, it's primarily Eurocentric and, ah, male focused, its tendency to view development, ah, as a linear process and its, I think, struggles and challenges in sometimes integrating contextual and cultural issues into the process, ah, of development. Nonetheless, many of the life issues, crises, cycle stages, etcetera, outlined by Erikson can hope, help almost anyone to explore how past issues can affect current and previous, ah, life development and professional development. Derald, if, if I may, your life certainly has been a very remarkable one, and one that I think deserves close introspection, ah, and thought. And I think through, through understanding some of your experiences and issues, some of the things that you've gone through, that can certainly help lots of people to perhaps better understand their lives and, ah, certainly serve as a role model for kind of, ways of being. Especially as an Asian-American male psychologist who's ha, who's had so much influence, ah, in the fields of counseling and in the field of, of applied psychology. Let me start off by talking about the first, ah, kind of stage of Erikson's developmental theory. And again, ah, for me, the, the theory is not as kinda linear and sequential as he may have suggested. But the first stage that he talks about is trust versus mistrust. Ah, as you think about some of your early years, uhm, birth through maybe two, three, four years old, etcetera, ah, could you share a little bit about kind of, your life? Ah, your family situation perhaps even the social and cultural context through which you've grown up and how issues of trust and/or mistrust might had been manifested in your life at that time. 

00:04:25
DERALD WING SUE Well, first of all, Madonna, thank you for, uhm, the interview and I appreciate the kind words. Uhm, I'm also very flattered I think that I'm asked to do this, uhm, ah, ah, life review. Ah, if I think about my life, my early childhood experiences, I come from a family of, uhm, a large family. I come of, ah, from a family of four brothers and one sister. Uhm, my father ah, actually, I, I could say immigrated, uhm, ah, from China but actually, ah, stow aboard, a, a ship when he was, I think, about 14 or 15. Took great courage and, and came to the United States, uhm, uhm, met my mother who, ah, in Portland, Oregon and you know, set up, ah, a business in, in Chinatown. Uhm, as, when I recall as growing up together as, as Asians in a predominantly white community although we were, ah, in Chinatown, it was really, ah, ah, a period of life in which we felt like we were outsiders. And this is a theme that, uhm, ah, I think I experienced throughout my life especially when we moved to, when my father wanted to make, uhm, ah, you know, a better life for us in terms of purchasing a home in the Southeast District of, of Portland, Oregon. Uhm, that increased my feeling of isolation, uhm, a feeling of being different because it was primarily an all-white community, ah, an all-white school. But it, ah, had the effect of making us, uhm, ah, depend very much on one another for validation, (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
DERALD WING SUE and my brothers, my brother, Stan, my older brother, Dave, uhm, ah, my mother and father. It was almost like we were, uhm, this unit that banded together, uhm, in, in, in a community that we felt was quite invalidating. And I don't wanna say that it was hostile but it was, uhm, very invalidating to people of color especially to Asian Americans where we were not fully accepted, ah, into the community but not seen as, ah, threats. We were often ti, times put in a, uhm, ah, an, unenviable position of being compared, ah, to our, ah, Black brothers and, and sisters or other, uhm, ah, students. Uhm, and we felt really much on the, you know, the margins of, of that existence. And so, when you talk about trust-mistrust, uhm, the greatest trust we had was in the family unit. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
DERALD WING SUE And we always perceive with, uhm, a kind of some degree of suspiciousness of, of, uhm, ah, well, you know, the, the overall white community that we were in. And I think that, that had a great deal of effect, uhm, that led me to the study of, of, uhm, ah, cultural mistrust, the meaning of it. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and the suspiciousness that we had about the motives of, of white folks. Because, ah, in essence, I, I don't believe that they were, uhm, evil, ah, poorly intentioned individuals. But by virtue of their actions and how they, uhm, related to us, we felt very much invalidated, very much invisible, very much, ah, unheard. Our voices were, were really not given, ah, the weight that, uhm, ah, that we ha, you know, that we wanted to have expressed. And maybe that's why I went into teaching and, and, uhm, ah, writing and research, ah, to have some voice about the Asian-American experience. 

00:08:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. It sounds as though in terms of early development, family played a very important role... (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
DERALD WING SUE Very much so. (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...ah, in terms of even like development of ethnic identity. 

00:08:20
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:08:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:08:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and just kind of what that lands to kind of the development of trust. (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:08:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Not just in oneself and in one's family... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and in, in members of one's ethnic... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:08:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...group but also in terms of relationships... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:08:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...with other ethnic groups. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DERALD WING SUE  But it, it also brought up great conflicts. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, you know, when you're young, ah, you want to fit in and, uhm, you know, the, the white Euro-American ways, uhm, that were communicated to us when we're uhm, ah, ah, students. Uhm, I know that my brothers and I felt very much pulled to being no different from other, uhm, ah, white students. Uhm, and while we desire that, we were always kind of pushed away because we would ne, never be fully, uhm, ah, accepted. And my parents, especially my father could not understand, uhm, why we would want to become Westernized, because he believes strongly, uhm, in, in Chinese heritage, Chinese culture. And here, we were on, on almost the margins of conflict between wanting one-way... (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
DERALD WING SUE ...but my father perceiving that if we became acculturated or assimilated, we were rejecting the, the Chinese way. And so, that was constant conflict, uhm, ah, you know, for all of us I think until our college years. Uhm, ah, you know, and I don't wanna use this, uhm, ah, issue but we at some stages in my life felt like, uhm, that our race, culture, and ethnicity was a handicap. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and this was something that I later discovered of what I call a culture blame or uhm, ah, person blame. That it's not the problem of being, uhm, Asian-American or Chinese-American, which as a youngster I incorporated. The problem resided in society's perception of what Chine, being, uhm, ah, a Chinese-American was like. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
DERALD WING SUE But that awakening really was a liberating force uhm, that occurred to me, ah, probably, I would say junior year in college. I, I can even label it, uhm, where it was ah, a feeling of liberation to suddenly feel like, uhm, I can be proud of my... (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, racial, cultural heritage. 

00:10:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. And that racism and racial discrimination, while it affects people of color, Asian-American, you, specifically... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:10:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...it's really a problem of white people. 

00:10:55
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:10:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:10:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE I guess in thinking about some of what you've said and, and, I kinda thinking about, uhm, kinda the development of people of color in this country. In the context of racial and ethnic discrimination, I think about then how you move from a place where kind of you resolved the life issues around trust versus mistrust and moved toward what Erikson calls, ah, autonomy versus, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE shame or doubt. Ah, and again, these are not necessarily, ah, sequential or, or necessarily at least in my view, goes from like ages zero to two years... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and you know, three to four years and things of that nature. Uhm, but just thinking about how, when one develops a sense of autonomy, independence and, I guess how I mean that is not necessarily from a, a purely western kind of perspective but more about, uhm, having a sense of, uhm, ownership of co, and comfort in... (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...oneself and who one is. Feeling rooted, feeling grounded, uhm, feeling, ah, to some degree, self-confident. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uhm, versus feeling ashamed about oneself and one's identity, having doubts about, who one is, fundamentally as a person. Can you talk about maybe how some of that was, was... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
DERALD WING SUE Well, (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  also manifested? (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
DERALD WING SUE you know, uhm, that's really a good question because, uhm, ah, that is symbolic and significant of I think the, the internal struggle that I went through, which is that, uhm, first of all, I had to begin to somehow get rid of society's perceptions of Asian-Americans that I had internalized. And, and those perceptions that I can say to you was that, uhm, ah, Asian-Americans are passive, ah, inarticulate, uhm, ah, you know, don't make good leaders, uhm, that they are sexually unattractive, which you know is not true, Madonna (laughing). Uhm, ah, you know, all of, ah, especially with, with, uhm, male Asian-Americans that, that was something that was prevalent in the society that we're quiet, uhm, ah, that we, you know, the, the model minority, that we don't cause problems, uhm, all of that I took in. And it's very difficult not to take that in, uhm, especially when you have, ah, resided in a community that, that, that communicated these thoughts to you. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
DERALD WING SUE So, the first step for me was to somehow overthrow that. And, uhm, ah, how I did that was that all of a sudden, I, I began to have experiences with, with Asian Americans that, uhm, in some ways shattered my image that they ah, don't make good leaders, ah, ah, aren't outspoken. I began to see, uhm, ah, several Asian-Americans, uhm, ah, ah, who, who'd shattered that image. And I began to wonder how I begin, you know, how I had accepted these, uhm, ah, thoughts and feelings. And ah, progressively throughout my years, ah, even after getting my doctorate, it was a, an attempt to discover who I am as a racial cultural being. And the greatest breakthrough for me was to ask myself why should I feel ashamed of my own racial and cultural heritage? And once I began to ask that question, it made me look at the broader societal, uhm, ah, relations between, uhm, ah, what I had been socialized to believe and whether it was true or not. And it was at this point that many of the thoughts, images, uhm, ah, statements from my mother and father began to have an influence on me. Uhm, I began to think that they've always told me to be proud, ah, of your ethnic, ah, heritage. Don't be ashamed of it. Don't let any, you know, when you're young that falls off your back. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
DERALD WING SUE But I think what happened, was that these and I, I give this an example. These statements are almost like seeds that are planted. They, you know, my parents must have felt frustrated that this didn't seem to be getting, uhm, ah, through to me. But when, when I began, when I got married, uhm, had my, uhm, ah, my son, uhm, actually Paulina had, had the son, (laughs) you know. I helped in it and, and he said this way. (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE A little bit (laughs). 

00:15:25
DERALD WING SUE Yes, uhm, but, uhm, when I was young, uhm, my father and mother forced me to go to Chinese school after regular school. Now, I hated it, you know, because, uhm, after, ah, at the end of, of regular school, you know, my white classmates would be out on the playgrounds and teeter-totters. I would be forced to go to Chinese school to learn, uhm, ah, ah, Cantonese, to learn, ah, how to write in Chinese. And I was, I resented that because it was a hard, uhm, ah, day on our part. And, and it was part of my, uhm, ah, family's desire that we maintain our ethnic heritage and come to understand it. Uhm, and when I had, when, when we had our first son, ah, actually, we only have one son, but when we had DP, uhm, and when he got to the point where he was entering kindergarten, ah, and even before that, I suddenly found myself saying to, ah, Paulina, uhm, "Maybe we should send them to Chinese school." And when I made that statement, it was, came out of the blue. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
DERALD WING SUE And I realized how strong, uhm, the seeds that my parents have planted in me, uhm, ah, would come out at, at critical stages in, in a person's life. And I think that they planted seeds that have consistently blossomed at, une, ah, ah, unexpected times. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, another seed that I think liberated me was, uhm, was this, uh, you know, statement I think that comes from again my father, which is at, you know, ah, being proud of Chinese, being Chinese doesn't necessarily mean, uhm, that you have to reject, uhm, ah, the white ways. Now, I never understood that because I always saw it as a dichotomy to become Westernized or maintain your heritage. And I had no, ah, when I began to, uhm, ah, realize that being proud of Asian-American is not a rejection of Euro-American culture... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
DERALD WING SUE ...or even, ah, adopting ah, Euro-American ways is not a rejection of Asian-American ways. And it really set me on a path where, uhm, ah, what I co, considered to be, ah, integration of who I am as, as a racial cultural being. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
DERALD WING SUE And it was a realization that in all cultures whether in Chinese or in, uhm, ah, Western culture, there are positive aspects about it as if, ah, and there are negative aspects, ah, of all cultures. And the task that I had was to integrate I think, uhm, ah, these two, uhm, ah, cultures and to say that it's not a, a matter of one, or, ah, over the other. And then the third thing that liberated me, I think, was a realization that, uhm, I, and I think that, uh, that the realization that it is not, you know, the antagonism that oftentimes goes in terms of race relations that it is not white people that represent the antagonist that I engaged in. It is the issue of white supremacy. And when I began to see that, I no longer saw white folks as enemies. I began to see them as equally victims in a, (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
DERALD WING SUE ah, a society that, that, uhm, ah, that, that culturally conditions us to take our places in, in a race relationship that is antagonistic to one another. And I think that began to free me in terms of understanding, ah, relationships such the true meaning of interracial, intercultural relationships. 

00:19:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. When I think about your third point, I think about how fortunate, ah, and blessed that you are, that you are able to do that. Because we probably both know of many people who are in a place where they continue to view a certain racial or ethnic group as the enemy, the people to avoid, the people... (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...who have hurt us, etcetera. And while it's true that we may be hurt by people, their actions and, and things of, of that nature, understanding that also whites are the victim... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...of their own racism and that, ah, ah, in fact, being able to see that there are certainly white people who serve as allies... 

00:19:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  ah, in the struggle against racism, ah, and in the struggle towards kind of, uhm, equality and, and fairness for all and being able to really live truly in a, in a multicultural... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...so, society is important. Uhm, we begin to really appreciate kind of, the range, ah, of people, white people in particular and just kind of the complexities of the issues. And I think all of those things can affect, ah, I think some of what you were talking about in terms of developing a sense of, ah, initiative, autonomy kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
DERALD WING SUE Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...personhood, (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:20:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ah, etcetera. Ah, one of the other, ah, ah, kind of stages that Erikson talks about is, ah, initiative versus guilt. And he also talks about industry versus inferiority. So, when I think about initiative and industry as, ah, two important, uhm, positive, I view them as positive kind of developmental life tasks in the context of a history of racial... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...ethnic kind of oppression, you know, some struggles with ah, kind of self-doubt and kind of ethnic identity... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...development. How did you do that, the industry and, uhm, ah, the initiative versus the internalization of guilt, ah, and inferiority? How did that come about? 

00:21:15
DERALD WING SUE  Well, I, ah, first of all, I think I'm still going through that process. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DERALD WING SUE I mean, that, that I think is a lifelong, uhm, ah, developmental journey. And, and that's one of the things that I do have difficulties with, uhm, these developmental models because they, they, they put time periods... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
DERALD WING SUE ...almost about when it, ah, happens. Uhm, and to me sometimes it happens way into, uhm, ah, into, ah, ah, a person's, uhm, uhm, ah, life stage or, or career. But, uhm, I, I don't know how to give that answer, uhm, I've had, you know, people have constantly asked me, "Well, how did you begin to develop that, uhm, ah, particular ah, perspective?" And I think that, I've really along the way have been fortunate to, uhm, meet individuals who have, ah, allowed me to understand, uhm, their world views. It, it started, you know, my original, uhm, work started as a, a counseling psychologist. Uhm, in fact for three years after I got my doctorate, I did, ah, counseling work at the University of, ah, California in Berkeley and to listen to the life stories. Ah, and that's what I believe counseling, ah, you know, and psychotherapy is. I was sitting down listening to the life story of white students, of black students, of Asian students, and, ah, realizing that I shared many, uhm, ah, issues with them. But there were different issues that, that arose as well. So that, uhm, it began to force me to kind of understand the world view of people who were far different than what my world view was all about. And I think it was at that stage that I began to make a, uhm, conscious decision in my career that I wanted to deal with world views, and what prevented us from understanding, ah, one another, what makes, uhm, it difficult to, for example to understand one another in terms of issues that, ah, that deal with race. Uhm, and it has now really blossomed into almost a movement and I, that you know, ah, away from simply counseling and psychotherapy. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
DERALD WING SUE It has moved into the range of what constitutes one's racial reality? It's not that there aren't other issues that, uhm, ah, that are very important like socio-economic, uhm, uhm, or class issues, gender issues, gay-lesbian or sexual, uhm, ah, ah, orientation issues. But one of the things that I've been fascinated about is that race is one of the most powerful de, determiners of world views. And so, uhm, it's, it's been an area of fascination for me. And, uhm, it's almost like I feel driven. It, it's not, you know, uhm, it, it's not a manner that, ah, I feel like I made a decision, uhm, although, you know, some people will, will say that to be so. It's almost like that's me and it's, it's a process and I'm driven to do it. I mean, there are times in which I've said things and done things that, uhm, even my wife, ah, has warned me against, uhm, ah, saying or doing. Uhm, you know, some of the, the early works that I've done and the continuing works pushed buttons in people. Uhm, ah, ah, for example, I just wrote, uhm, an opinion/editorial about ah, the racial reality of White America and can ah, someone like Kobe Bryant, get a fair trial? And I'm sure that uhm, if that opinion/editorial gets published some place, it's going to push buttons uhm, ah, in individuals. Now, I could sit back and easily say that uhm, I wanna uh, write it so it's more acceptable. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
DERALD WING SUE  But, it's been a characteristic I think of, of uhm, my presentations and writings where people, where I feel that uhm, it is very important to be honest and to sta, to state it uhm, ah, directly. And at times, uhm, I don't know why I've felt driven ah, to do that, when at times it would've been easier not to have made those statements. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, I mean, we've gotten, ah, you know, like, like, I'm, I'm not sure, I've, I've shared with you uhm, ah, I've gotten threats on my life, especially when we spoke uhm, I gave testimony before Clinton's Race Advisory Board. Uhm, it's gotten to the point where, where Paulina has wanted me to up my life insurance, uhm, (laughs) ah, in terms of this... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, and my new book, I, I think it's going to uhm, ah, cause a lot of, of, ah, reactions from, ah, from individuals. Uhm, so, ah, I'm not sure if I can answer that question, Madonna, (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
DERALD WING SUE about uhm, I can uhm, have markers in my life where major things have occurred that have uhm, uhm, that altered my life. Such as uhm, ah, what happened uhm, ah, to, to our son. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
DERALD WING SUE When the police in our community broke down the front door, arrested him on trumped up charges uhm, as a means of retaliating against, I would say, uhm, uhm, my wife's work in the community and our, our outspokenness in the community on the importance of multicultural issues and, and racism awareness uhm, ah, training that the city had to, to undergo. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, and rather than intimidating us, uhm, and you know, to, it, it spurred us on that, you know, this is something that we need to do. (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm 

00:27:20
DERALD WING SUE And I think that another thing and I know I'm being long-winded about this, it's that ah, in some ways the realization that I've come to and that realization is that uhm, we will never eradicate bias, bigotry, and racism. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
DERALD WING SUE And if. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE I agree with that. 

00:27:40
DERALD WING SUE Yeah, and if my goal uhm, what I do in life is based upon achieving that uhm, then I should give up. I, you know, because it, you know, if, if that indeed, is what I, I think and I, I've come to this understanding that, that the doing, the process of combating racism, of fighting for social justice is as important as the outcome. (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
DERALD WING SUE Because it really is a statement of who you are and your integrity. And that's the driving force I'd be, you know, there, there's nothing more rewarding than to know that what you say uhm, and what you do in your professional work is a true reflection of your, your beliefs. In know a lot of colleagues who do a lot of research, that they do it for different reasons. And there's nothing wrong in that. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
DERALD WING SUE But ah, the reward and joy is that what you do in life is an expression of who you are, your total being, is the most rewarding uhm, ah, thing. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
DERALD WING SUE And uhm, at times it's been costly ah, ah, to my family (crosstalk). 

00:28:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, but it's something I think that you know, that uhm, I, I really feel I need to do. 

00:28:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. I think you, you, you talked about uhm, having a difficult time maybe answering the question. But I think you really did because when I consider kind of, industry and what that means, an initiative, I mean, those are certainly qualities and characteristics I would... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...use to describe those issues and processes that you brought up. Ah, dealing with the police who... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...brought up these trumped up charges ah, against your son. Having the initiative ah, and the industry, the power, the willpower, and the fortitude to be able to kind of really work... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...with him and the rest of your family to, to combat that and to deal with that and to actually not allow it to make you a bitter... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm 

00:29:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...person, but a better person. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm 

00:29:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE A stronger person, a person who uses that to propel himself to continue to do... (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm 

00:29:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...bigger and better things. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE I think that that's an important... (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ..uhm, the way you answered that, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:29:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...is, is, is really beautiful, and important... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...I think a nice way to illustrate. 

00:30:00
DERALD WING SUE But, but I do wanna say something, Madonna, that when this incident with my son happened, I had many doubts about whether we should continue to fight... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, and it really, and you know, was Paulina, who really had the strength to, to push us on. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
DERALD WING SUE So, uhm, I don't wanna take total credit. There were times in which I felt like maybe it would be best to take the, the, the plea bargains that they were offering rather than to see it to the end where they finally had, the city had to finally drop the charges. 

00:30:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. I think that's honest too... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...that even that ambivalence that comes with... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:30:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  do we fight it? Do we not? Sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:30:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...we feel like it, sometimes ah, kinda, we don't. You mentioned your book, your new book that's coming out and I know it's on racism. Can you share kind of a little bit ah, of that and maybe how some of your previous ah, life events and even current ones, affected how you wrote that book, how you presented information, (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE what you presented, etcetera? 

00:31:00
DERALD WING SUE What, in this, this was, there were two books that in my career that represent a labor of love. Uhm, one of them was Counseling the Culturally Diverse, which... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
DERALD WING SUE ...is in the fourth, uhm, ah, edition now and which is you know, ah, has been very well received. Although when it first came out, I was told that it wouldn't do well because it, it was too radical and this... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

00:31:20
DERALD WING SUE ...was in the 19 uhm, ah, 80's, but it's done very well uhm, in, in terms of, of I think the awakening of the public. The, the second, and I loved that book. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
DERALD WING SUE That, that book uhm, represented uhm, ah, the heart and soul of, of uhm, ah, my own personal experiences of, of, uhm, ah, realizing that well, see, would, there was a period of time in my life in, in college that I didn't go in for counseling ah, to the Counseling Center and realized that uhm, that the process was so different from the way uhm, ah, I was raised ah, as, as an Asian-American. That what they wanted me, the goals of, of counseling, that the process of sitting there and talking and all the dynamics was antagonistic to uhm, what my father raised, my father and mother raised me to believe in. And so, the book was a result of that by not, questioning whether traditional forms of counseling and psychotherapy was helpful. The, and it took, ah, you know and that's gone through series of, of revisions but the, the book that really represents where I am currently at uhm, was just published this year, it's Overcoming ah, our Racism: The Journey to Liberation. And that was the direct result again of uhm, testifying before Clinton's Race Advisory Board in 1997. There were uhm, ah, three of us who were asked to testify. It was uhm, ah, Dr. James Jones, who organized the, the whole uhm, ah, the, you know, the whole presentation. And, and, uhm, James is the author of, really, a top book on prejudice and racism. Ah, Dr. Jack Davideo, ah, a White, uhm, a brother, a psychologist who does all this work on, on modern racism that I think the, the viewers would really, ah, find fascinating and I was asked to talk about what the average, uhm, American citizen could do. Now, ah, during the testimony that was on C-SPAN and a number of, ah, of, uhm, uhm, you know, outlets, uh, what, what happened was that I, I thought that I had presented a very low key presentation... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
DERALD WING SUE ...of, of. 

00:33:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Well, low key for you, doctor(ph). 

00:33:45
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. (laughs) 

00:33:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Yeah. (laughs) 

00:33:45
DERALD WING SUE A low key presentation. Uhm, ah, well, when I showed it to my classes, they, they think that it's very low key. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
DERALD WING SUE I mean, uhm, but, ah, the realization was this, after that presentation, which went about 20, 30 minutes, uhm, we received, and not just myself, uhm, hate mail, e-mail, (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

00:34:05
DERALD WING SUE uhm, ah, saying, claiming that we were, ah, racist but of a different color. And during that, uhm, ah, testimony, I'd talked about the fact that, uhm, that no one who is born and raised in this society could, uhm, ah, could in any way be free of the cultural conditioning and the biases, the stereotypes that, that, uhm, ah, are socially conditioned in them. And so, I made a point that every, uhm, each and everyone of us, especially White Americans, ah, have inherited these biases and that they, they are unconscious, they need to look at them because while they may believe that their actions, uhm, are helpful and well intentioned, they, and ultimately, may be discriminatory or oppressive. Well, they reacted very strongly to that and, uhm, ah, it, it made me realize, ah, several things. One is that, that while I am protected in an ivory tower where ideas are accepted to the general American, uhm, ah, public, that is not, that's not where their world view was at. Uhm, and so Paulina again said to me, "You know, you've got to reach out to the American public. I mean, you, you can't keep writing for academics who, you know, on the how, if you really wanna do something, you've got to reach the general public." So I decided that I would write a book on racism, uhm, for the general public. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
DERALD WING SUE And so it's not meant to be, and although it's really difficult for an academic to write for a general population but it isn't, uhm, ah, like I, it's citations and, and documentations. I wrote the book, uhm, and also at the end of it, at, at the end of every chapter have suggestions of what people could do. There's inventories, exercises, films, videos that they could look at that would deal with, with the, uhm, ah, the theme of each of those, uhm, ah, ah, chapters. And well, ah, when I first wrote it, uhm, ah, you know, the, the, the president of, of Teachers College was kind enough to, uhm, ah, refer me to, ah, an agent, ah, to help me publish the book. I gave it to an agent who is a, a White male, ah, who read it and said he was totally offended... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

00:36:35
DERALD WING SUE  ah, by the book. It made him angry, uhm, ah, and, and, that, ah, in no way did he want to be part of, of, this particular book. Well, you know, uh, you know, despite the fact that I, you know, believe strongly in the book, I, you know, when you get that type of reaction, so I sent it to colleagues, White colleagues of mine and asked them, you know, is this o, offensive? Is this off the target? Is it, and, ah, the reactions I got from them was that they loved it. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
DERALD WING SUE That it was honest, direct, and, and to the point. Now, it may be that my co, White colleagues, my friends have different, uhm, ah, view on this but, uhm, I know I sent it to Dr. Allen Ivey... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, to, uhm, Dr. Michael D'Andrea. I also asked, uhm, ah, Dr. Thomas Parham to look at it. They all encouraged me to write it. And luckily, I found, and it isn't just White males because, uhm, Jossey Bass, the publisher had a White male who was the editor, uhm, ah, doc, ah, Adam Winsler who looked at the, ah, manuscript and loved it. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

00:37:45
DERALD WING SUE Ah, although he asked me to change the title. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
DERALD WING SUE The original title of the book was that, ah, "You Are A Racist." (laughs) Then he told me it would not, you know, you, the, the message is more important than the title. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
DERALD WING SUE So, it's now overcoming our racism. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and it's been doing very well. But the thesis of the book, uhm, is that it is not the skin heads, the White supremacist who do the greatest harm to people of color. It is a well intentioned, uhm, uhm, you know, justice-loving individuals, (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
DERALD WING SUE who would, who are, ah, experience themselves as good people, who do the harm by virtue of their unconscious, ah, biases and, and prejudices. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
DERALD WING SUE And it talks about the major barriers of, of, to overcome that. Ah, it also is very much linked to what I call cultural confidence in, in ah, counseling because I talk about the invisibility of White supremacy, the invisibility of whiteness and how it, not only inundates I think, ordinary citizens in the world work and education but on mental health practice. To become culturally competent in counseling and psychotherapy, if I shift back to, to, uhm, my original roots, means that people have to, uhm, overcome this hidden veil of White supremacy that really inundates even a theory like Erik Erikson. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
DERALD WING SUE That is linear, that, that, uhm, comes from a White male perspective. (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
DERALD WING SUE And, uhm, the, and, and people who read it don't realize that, because as I tried to indicate whiteness, uhm, ah, is a default standard... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
DERALD WING SUE ...in which everything else is compared to it and by virtue of comparing to it, it means that there is a standard that is superior to other cultural, uhm, ah, perspectives. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DERALD WING SUE  And that, by the way, was a reason why I changed the title of the book, ah, "Counseling The Culturally Different" to "Counseling The Culturally Diverse." (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
DERALD WING SUE Because Counseling the Culturally Different ask a question which is different from what? (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
DERALD WING SUE And it is a White-Euro American standards that we hold as the major, ah, standard. And by virtue of saying culturally diverse, we're talking about, ah, putting diversity on an equal footing where being Asian, Black, White, Native American, Latino, Hispanic-American are all, uhm, ah, aspects of diversity. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, that's what I, I think the book is, is trying to communicate. 

00:40:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Although, I can imagine when you wrote the first version of Counseling the Culturally Different in 1981, at least that's when it was published. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:40:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE The Culturally Different piece really was in response to the... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:40:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...overwhelmingly White literature... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:40:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...that existed. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:40:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE And so, that seemed at the time... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:40:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...certainly, a very fitting title. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE But I like how you've kind of evolved... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...uhm, into the Culturally Diverse... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and really including all different types of... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:40:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...ah, cultural groups beyond just racial... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:41:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and ethnic groups as well. You know, it, when I think about all you're doing now as someone who's retired from California State... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  University at Hayward but, you know, uhm, certainly we're fortunate enough to have you here at Teachers College, uhm, and just kind of being a person who's retired, although, it's not really fair (laughs) to call you retired, you're still working but, you know, but I get the sense that you'll always be someone who will work, who will generate, uhm, who will continue to produce in a sense. And when I think about one of, kind of the stages of Erikson's theory kind of generativity, ah, versus stagnation. Ah, stagnation then seemed like was ever an issue for you, but I imagine at some point when you think about, uhm, you know, retiring, when you thought about retiring then to move on to something else, there's a process that I imagine you go through around, how much do I wanna do, what do I wanna do, what do I want the rest of my life to be defined by kind of taking stop in essence of... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...where you work? Can you say a little bit about that process for you personally and... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:42:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and professionally maybe? 

00:42:10
DERALD WING SUE Yeah, you know, I think that we had talked about this earlier, uhm, Madonna, which is it, it's very difficult for, ah, me to talk, ah, ah, see, it, it seems like things just kept flowing. (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, and, and when I say flowing is that I don't perceive myself as retiring. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, ah, in the sense that retirement, uhm, ah, ah, connotes, I mean, it, it was almost like you, you'll just continue moving on, on a path that the theme and the path remains the same. Ah, so I never saw being, uhm, at, I think it was 26 years at, ah, 26 or 27 years at the California State University hmm(ph), at Hayward, uhm, that leaving that institution was not retirement to me. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
DERALD WING SUE  Although technically it was retirement because in, in some sense I retired and went on the public employees retirement plan, uhm, but, ah, you know, it, it was just an, uhm, an issue of moving on where... 

00:43:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

00:43:10
DERALD WING SUE  Teachers College, uhm, offered me ah, another opportunity to do something quite different. Ah, I've always known, ah, ah, at Cal. State University in Hayward, uhm, we were very much involved, ah, in counselor education, training, uhm, uhm, master's, uhm, ah, students and, in, in terms of, ah, becoming, ah, good, uhm, ah, mental health counselors or marriage and family therapists. I spent seven years also, uhm, during that period working at the California School of Professional Psychology and I, uhm, accepted a dual appointment, uhm, to work with them primarily because I had this desire to work with doctoral students that, that, at the, ah, at Cal. State Hayward, uhm, while I'd love working with the master's students, it was different than working with, uhm, ah, students who could engage in, in research, uhm, ah, and, and really work on, ah, ah, ah, dissertation. Ah, and, I, I loved it. I, I don't think I would've ever left, uhm, uhm, ah, CSPP, the California School of Professional Psychology 'coz I planned to leave Hayward in order to continue working at CSPP but then, uhm, Teachers College came along, which you had a great (laughs) deal to do with it, as well as Dr. Carter, I think, uhm, uhm, ah, you know, asked, you know made an opportunity. And one of the things that I'm associated with Teachers College was the ability to engage in wider social justice issues. You know, Teachers College is known for, uhm, ah, for issues of social justice. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
DERALD WING SUE And, uhm, I've been here now nearly two and a half years, uhm, and I truly like the opportunity to have a wider social forum, uhm, and that's where I think the, the racism book, uhm, getting involved in, in, uhm, making more videos on the topic, uhm, speaking to larger groups, uhm, writing opinion pieces, ah, based upon, uhm, ah, research. And right now, I'm, I'm even thinking about, you know, possible new direction in terms of how you can give back to society some, uh, you know, a more, in terms of what has been so helpful for me in terms of I consider my racial awakening. And I consider it now, the overall goal that I have, uhm, is two goals. One is social justice the, uhm, ah, and the other one is to contribute as much as possible, uhm, to helping others with their own racial/cultural awakening. (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
DERALD WING SUE Because that is one of the things that, uhm, I feel is, is, uhm, sorely lacking, uhm, in our society, and I would love to see it happen in, ah, K through 12. (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
DERALD WING SUE Because that's the only, uhm, that's the only forum in which we reach every citizen, hopefully anyway... (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, ah, in the United States. (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
DERALD WING SUE We don't do it through workshop, through, uhm, uhm, ah, selected higher education, ah, by community forums because people who don't think it's important just won't be exposed to it. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
DERALD WING SUE  It's only in K through 12, and Teachers College works strongly in K through 12. 

00:46:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. It sounds as though in terms of then kind of upcoming life adventures that, that's an important, uhm, kind of aspect of what, what you wanna do. Can you give some specifics about how you'd like to, maybe to do that or maybe some dreams or fantasies about how that might come about? 

00:47:10
DERALD WING SUE Well, you know, I really would like to build much more coalitions so that I can free myself from some of the... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm (laughs). 

00:47:15
DERALD WING SUE ...responsibilities in our, our program and department by building greater coalitions with, uhm, ah, organizational, uhm, leadership, organizational, uhm, industrial, uhm, uhm, you know, department, I think, at Teachers College are, as well as curriculum and Teacher Education, (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
DERALD WING SUE uhm, because be, prior to even coming to Teachers College and, and being pulled in, in a number of different directions, I had been working with various school systems about how to make, uhm, ah, their, the, you know, ah, the school much more multicultural. And I had also been working with a number of other colleagues, uhm, in terms of what I have called multicultural organizational development... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
DERALD WING SUE ...because I, I see that, uhm, while counseling and psychotherapy is very helpful on an individual or group basis, the ultimate change, we're talking about issues of social justice, issues of oppression like racism, sexism, ah, homophobia, I think we have to reach organizations and, uhm, ah, or society in, in, in terms of social policy. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
DERALD WING SUE And so, I'm, I'm trying as much as possible to educate myself as to, uhm, what, what the issues are. You know, that's been one of the things that I feel is very ethnocentric in our field of counseling and psychotherapy. We, we get good training in terms of trying to understand individuals but little training in understanding systems' organizational, uhm, organizations and uhm, societal, political, uhm, ah, functioning. (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
DERALD WING SUE And, uhm, that's where I think we, we need to begin to, uhm, ah, concentrate more and more because if we want to influence, uhm, larger social systems, we've got to understand how they operate. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
DERALD WING SUE And most of us don't. 

00:49:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Right. 

00:49:15
DERALD WING SUE Ah, I know it's been enlightening to me... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
DERALD WING SUE ...uhm, ah, in my path where I thought I was doing things organizationally correct and then finding huge, uhm, uhm, you know, ah, a huge backlash to, ah, what I thought was effective of change. 

00:49:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Although that they have a lot to do... (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:49:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...with those organizational norms... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:49:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...may not be that... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:49:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...what they did was wrong, kind of in a broader context... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:49:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...but in terms of not fitting into the norms of the organization. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. And, and not understanding how systems operate, (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
DERALD WING SUE not understanding that when I go into a university and try to get them to change, uhm, their admissions policies, uhm, ah, and, and getting them to do it, not realizing that, ah, that change in one system, unless you change other systems will ah, be fought uhm, ah, strongly. (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
DERALD WING SUE And so I've, I've come to realize that uhm, that you got to concern with the total system before you implement change in, in, uhm, ah, just, just another one. 

00:50:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. This is a question and I think you'd, I probably know the answer to this, but I wanted to ask you anyway, do you have any regrets about things that you have done or maybe have not done in your life and maybe if you have regrets about things you haven't done yet, do... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...you anticipate that those are things that, that you might do in the future? 

00:50:45
DERALD WING SUE Well, you, you know Madonna, uhm, I, if I think about my career in terms of uhm, the work that I've done, and(ph) I, I, I don't have major regrets about what I've done and the direction of that I've gone. I'd, I, I, you know, uhm, I, I, I wish that I would have arrive at this stage, (laughs) when I have got my ah, ah, Ph.D. so I could do more. I think the major regret that ah, you and I have talked about uhm, quite often is that I do characterize myself as a workaholic uhm, that regret and, and I know that one of the issues I constantly deal with uhm, ah, with ah, ah, some of my doctorate students here is I constantly tell them uhm, don't look at me as a role model. Because I want you to have a more balanced life, uhm, ah, it's hard to communicate to them, because by virtue of being so involved, uhm, in, in terms of, of this work, uhm, there has to be a suffering in one's personal life. (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Hmm. 

00:52:00
DERALD WING SUE And uhm, ah, you know, I know that it's hard for me to talk about but I know that my personal life, especially uhm, ah, with my children and my wife might have suffered as a result, in fact I know they have suffered somewhat from ah, uh, what you know the, the goal directing this is that, that I approaches with, I mean uhm, so the issue is that I, I can say it to other, do as I say not as I do, (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:52:25
DERALD WING SUE live a balanced life. 

00:52:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, ah, that is ah, I think an important thing that I would say. 

00:52:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Are there things you feel like you could do to begin to remedy that for your self? Like I hear that don't do as I do ah, kinda do as I say, but in thinking about maybe ways that you would want to change that even if it's not right ...(crosstalk) 

00:52:45
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:52:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  now but in the near future, are there ways that you thought about... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
DERALD WING SUE So... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ... would like to do? (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
DERALD WING SUE ...you'd like to be my counselor (laughs). 

00:52:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE No, we all. (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
DERALD WING SUE We got to (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:52:56
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Just in terms of, (crosstalk) 

00:52:56
DERALD WING SUE ...talk about this. (crosstalk) 

00:52:56
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...because you're not, I, I guess just uhm, not wanting you to feel like ... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:53:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...you're in a place were you're stuck and that's just kinda, that's the way it's gotta be but that it could be different... (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:53:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...if you envisioned it differently. 

00:53:05
DERALD WING SUE  Yeah. See I think that, I think ah, what we have here is that I would have to reframe(ph). You know, if you look at what I've been talking about, uhm, you know, a theme that I've been talking about is almost like I'm telling people, I can't control this, you know and it, it deal(ph) on, ah, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
DERALD WING SUE ...that there's, that there's an internal pressure to do things I can't control it and now as long as I, and maybe the people are listening (laughs)... (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:53:40
DERALD WING SUE ...to this and we're getting into the area of, of therapy, as long as I define it that way, uhm, then what I'm saying is that I don't want, ah, I don't have the ability to force, to change or alter that course that is... (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:53:55
DERALD WING SUE ...going on and whether it's not wanting to change or not wanting the responsibility, uhm, is something that uhm, ah, I have thought about quite often. Because even, uhm, in, in an article I did with, ah, Lisa Hoshmand on, uhm, ah, you know on Psychology In My Life, when she did a critical analysis of my writing, uhm, I think she indicated that sort, or someone who had responded to this that it's interesting that, uhm, ah, Professor Sue writes as if, uhm, this is, this is something, uhm, ah, you know an aspect of his life that he is, is impelled to do. And when I read that, it, it really didn't dawn on me but that was what I was presenting. That there's a force within me that is pulling and you know, pushing me forward and as I listen to my discussion here with you, I, I think that same theme, uhm, ah, is arising, uhm, and I don't know Madonna whether it's that I don't want to change and accept the responsibility or I need to really think seriously about the implications it has for, for my personal and family life. 

00:55:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:55:15
DERALD WING SUE Ah, maybe that's another... (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
DERALD WING SUE ...year or so of therapy that you... (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. (laughs) 

00:55:20
DERALD WING SUE ...can conduct with me (laughs). 

00:55:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Or just to be, I think having the initial awareness... (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:55:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...of that, that struggle... (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:55:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...is important and it's a process and it's not that you have to make a decision about that today or tomorrow or next week but being aware of some of the choices...(crosstalk) 

00:55:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...you're making now. The impact or the effect of those choices have... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:55:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...in different areas of your life and getting to a place one day where you say, "You know I wanna do this." (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DERALD WING SUE  Yes. 

00:55:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Work is important. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:55:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE It's still important to me, yet I know there are other things that are also... (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:55:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...important. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:55:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Maybe a little more important, (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:55:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE a little less important, etcetera but that you give yourself in essence permission to be driven by little bit of what's in here, (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE instead of just kind of what's out there. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:56:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Right? 

00:56:05
DERALD WING SUE Thank you. 

00:56:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE And I think gave me some very important information about uhm, just kind of how you function, the courage you've, (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
DERALD WING SUE Hmm. 

00:56:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE you've had in the course of doing this work, the kind of things that I think I anticipate going through ah, since I'm at the beginning of my career... (crosstalk) 

00:56:25
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:56:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...re, relatively speaking. No, I'm just joking (laughs) with you, ah, but I wonder. 

00:56:30
DERALD WING SUE But you are Madonna. 

00:56:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE (laughs) Well, thank you, uhm, I wanted to know if you had ah, any additional thoughts or reactions to kind of what you've talked about and ah, also maybe ending with any words of advice you might have about people who are watching ah, the interview. 

00:56:45
DERALD WING SUE Well I, I think Madonna that I would go back to the earlier statement that, that I made. Uhm, one of them is to try to live a balanced life. Uhm, uh, you know in terms of, of, of uhm, balancing the personal, the personal, social with the career uhm, ah, work that you have. Uhm, one of the things that I tell people when they say that I really wanna get into this multicultural field and there enthused about it, uhm, is that you have to love and believe truly in what you do in life, because I do not see what I do as work. Ah I see, I see serving on committees is work... (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE (laughs) Yes. 

00:57:30
DERALD WING SUE ...but not in terms of you have to really love and feel that it is true to you in your heart... (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
DERALD WING SUE ...ah, in terms of, of the ideas and the research that, that ah, you're conducting, so that anyone who goes into this field, uhm, are if, if you have that type of, of desire, uhm, a heart and love where you, it is an expression of your total being, uhm, I won't need to give you any advice... (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:57:55
DERALD WING SUE ...except for the, the ah, balance that, that one has. Uhm, the other thing I think advice that I would give to people is that, uhm, in the field of multicultural counseling and therapy, in the field of social justice, uhm, in the work, on, in terms of dealing with oppression, ah, dealing with racism, sexism, ah, those of us who, who really devote our uhm, you know energies to that, need to realize that we are swimming uphill. Ah, and when you enter this arena you are going to get a lot of, uhm, people who will not like or believe in the worth of what you're doing. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
DERALD WING SUE  They'll see you as rocking the boat and they will uh, try to invalidate you. Uhm, and so the suggestion I have is that all of us need to find a support group. (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, whether it is family like I had when I was young to, ah, whether it is colleagues and friends, you need people to serve as a validating, uhm, ah, force that serves as nutrients to, uhm, that to the type of work that you're doing, because the type of work we do now when you talk about social justice is to ask for change and it is very difficult for people, for organizations and, and society to, to change and they would do everything to prevent that change, uhm, not from occurring, so it is to take care of yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and if you don't find the support in your work site, if you don't find that, you've got to go out and find it, ah, you know, elsewhere. And I've really been blessed by, uhm, the support that I've gotten from uhm, ah, my family, uhm, ah, both from, uhm, my mother and father, and, and brothers and, and sister but also from Paulina and, and my two kids who have been a, a source of support. Uhm, to colleagues, you know, to individuals of who, I call the National uhm, ah, Multicultural Conference, uhm, ah, group, uhm, which there are, you know, the people like, uhm, ah, Allen Ivey, (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
DERALD WING SUE Michael D'Adrea, Patricia Arredondo, ah, Thomas Parham, uhm, you know, uhm, you know, uhm, ah, Judy, ah, Daniels, these... (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
DERALD WING SUE are all people, ah, who have been helpful to another support group that I've been fortunate uhm, ah, to, to develop with. And that's Lisa Porche-Burke, Rosie Bingham, ah, and that, that, that lovely individual who will be (laughs) the next president of the American Psychological Association, uhm, Melba Vasquez. (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:00:45
DERALD WING SUE Ah, these are not just colleagues and I have to emphasize that, you know, you have colleagues that you work with and you like, but it is rare that you have colleagues who, uhm, become deep friends... (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
DERALD WING SUE ...who will support you, who, who you can feel vulnerable to in, in terms of talking about, ah, uhm, the, the dilemmas and, and fears and, and the feelings of vulnerability. Uhm, that's where I think that, uhm, ah, we need to do it and I don't want people to see me as an individual who has achieved this, uhm, ah, because this achievement really represents, uhm, something that's started, uhm, with my whole family and has just evolved with a lot of, uhm, ah, other people. (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
DERALD WING SUE And it, uh, it isn't, ah, also that it's people who you have contact with. It's people that you read about, Martin Luther King, uhm, ah, Gandhi, uhm, you know, even people in the 60's where influence ah, influential uhm, ah, in my, you know, ah, development. Their ideas, really nurture you. (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:02:00
DERALD WING SUE So when you find that, that becomes, uhm, ah, very important. (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
DERALD WING SUE And I guess those, I'm sure that there, you know more, uhm, ah, suggestions, uhm, and the last thing is, is do as I say not as I do. (laughs) Okay? 

01:02:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Well thank you so much, (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
DERALD WING SUE Thank you. 

01:02:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Derald, for your honesty and, and candor... (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
DERALD WING SUE Thank you. 

01:02:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...and I really appreciate it and I'm sure... (crosstalk) 

01:02:20

01:02:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE ...the viewers do as well. 

01:02:20
