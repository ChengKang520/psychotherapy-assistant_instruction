Dr. Ellyn Bader & Dr. Peter Pearson 

00:00:15
ELLYN BADER Hello, I'm Ellyn Bader and this is my husband Peter Pearson. Today it's Paul and Trish. When we sat down with them, we knew nothing about them. It's important to us to structure the session in such a way to learn about the couple's development and about their presenting problem and what it represents about where they're stuck developmentally. You will see how we structure the process of getting to know them. Learning about their history and getting some initial goals. You'll also learn about the paper exercise. This is an exercise originally created by Susan Campbell in her book, "The Couple's Journey". We've expanded that exercise and use it both diagnostically and as an intervention. So we thank you for joining us and let's get started. 

00:01:05
Trish & Paul 

00:01:05
Session # 1 

00:01:05
PETER PEARSON As we get started, how do you each feeling about being here, even though we haven't done anything yet in terms of the content of what we will be getting into. Just the fact that, here you are and we're getting started. 

00:01:20
TRISH All right, Paul asked me in the car, are you nervous. I said, well, you know, if I was unknown but I'm up for it and I trust the process and we were not sure, what we're gonna be getting into but I think I'm, I'm, I'll do that, I'm good. 

00:01:35
PETER PEARSON Cool. 

00:01:35
PAUL And umm…, I have reasonable faith in, in the therapeutic process and counseling because I've had success with it in the past. And I think I'm a communicator and like to talk about things in general so. Yeah, yeah so I'm here happily so. 

00:01:50
PETER PEARSON Terrific. 

00:01:50
ELLYN BADER That's great. 

00:01:55
PETER PEARSON So, when you think about today, what will happen that would make each of you think, gosh I'm really glad that I showed up today? 

00:02:00
PAUL Two levels. Umm… the first level would be just that we vote to the topic and got to a point of deeper understanding about it and actually, you know, felt that we understood each other a little better around it and being more personally, I would, on the second level, I would, I would clarify that as being heard which is something we talk about sometimes. 

00:02:20
ELLYN BADER So you would like to walk away with an experience that she's heard something that you want to communicate. 

00:02:30
PAUL Right. Yeah and I'm, I'm more open to willing to listen to. 

00:02:30
ELLYN BADER But that's been an issue that you have not sure you've been heard. 

00:02:35
PAUL Sometimes, yeah. 

00:02:35
PETER PEARSON If you're fully heard Paul, what does that mean? 

00:02:40
PAUL You know, it's, it doesn't look like anything in particular to me. It feels like something more than it looks like, something. Whatever I want or think in any given situation doesn't have to be the way it winds up. It doesn't have to be my way or her way or anything like that but the concept of being heard means that was incorporating and the thinking and the planning, understood, valued and then umm…, and then of you know, fairly discussed and collectively decided. 

00:03:05
PETER PEARSON And hopefully some, if corrective action was needed, some, something would happen on Trisha's part and she might do something different, if you were really heard that was, if you really hit the bulls eye. 

00:03:20
PAUL You know, it depends on the thing because sometimes it's just about the process. 

00:03:20
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:25
ELLYN BADER But it's how she responds that makes the difference. 

00:03:25
PAUL Yeah, and, and response and I'd say contribute to the process. 

00:03:30
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:03:30
ELLYN BADER How about you Trish? 

00:03:35
TRISH Response to him or just no more for myself? 

00:03:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, make this a, glad, you're here today. 

00:03:40
TRISH Umm… yeah, I think things keep coming up which is around these issues between us that umm… I'm hoping by discussing them more here, we can resolve them to a point where they don't come up and become, you know bigger issues that cause umm… some conflict and a couple of days of being upset and not talking, you know, some of those kinds of things and I think both hurt feelings on both parts, so if we can get through some things where we don't keep having these things coming up. Somewhere, it feels like, you know, I feel like I've heard him and when I'm trying to explain my side but it's still how he feels. So I'm clearly, I'm doing something wrong that I'm umm… not getting into the level and I think some of it I'm trying to explain where I am coming from, my side maybe I'm not feeling heard, you know or we're not hearing each other and then we are, we both hurt or feeling, you know, I feel like I can't win that you know, we're gonna keep having these issues over and over again and that somehow, there is something beyond what I can do to ever make him feel umm… better about it. 

00:04:40
PAUL Yeah. 

00:04:45
PETER PEARSON Okay. I think in more conventional approach for the person is sitting in the chairs over here might say you so, what are the issues you know, that you guys are struggling with? And… in the process of saying the issues, there is a strong instinct to say, well, I think, I know where the problem on these issues is. So, we might try something different which is… you might say on the issues that we struggle with, here is what I think, Paul's major complaints about me are. And Paul would say, "Well, I think here is what Trish's major complaints about me are." It's kind of a diagnostic question. At least at the beginning, it, what help us understand how well you guys have been listening to each other. So… it doesn't matter who goes first as you both get a chance to say, "here is what I think the major complaints about me are." 

00:05:45
PAUL Do you? 

00:05:45
TRISH We'll start. 

00:05:50
PAUL Okay. Umm… I think Trish would say about me that I'm too sensitive and that my uh… expectations get or you know, sometimes are unrealistic that the reality situations makes little harder. 

00:06:05
PETER PEARSON Okay. Uh… anything else in addition to those two things? 

00:06:10
PAUL Trish has been feeling that I haven't that umm… I don't help enough. 

00:06:20
ELLYN BADER Help with what? 

00:06:20
PAUL You know, day chores. 

00:06:25
TRISH Household. 

00:06:25
ELLYN BADER Household chores. 

00:06:25
PETER PEARSON Responsibilities, roles and responsibilities in the house, just to make things work a little easier. On a scale of 1 to 10, with ten being high confidence, ‘cause we're gonna ask Trish. So, you know, how did you, how confident are you that Trish will say, "You nailed it Paul." 

00:06:40
PAUL Oh, Id take eight. 

00:06:45
PETER PEARSON Barren(ph) eight. 

00:06:45
PAUL yeah. 

00:06:45
PETER PEARSON Here we check it out. 

00:06:45
PAUL Yeah. 

00:06:45
ELLYN BADER how do you do? 

00:06:50
TRISH The first two are, I was gonna say something is that, one, too sensitive but it's also a little bit more, for me it's like taking it personally that I did something purposely to hurt him or leave him out. So I just expand on that a little bit about the sensitive and the other one was… 

00:07:05
PETER PEARSON The expectations? 

00:07:05
PAUL Sensitive and realistic. 

00:07:10
ELLYN BADER A realistic expectation. 

00:07:10
TRISH Oh yes, and that was, yes, thank you. Umm… the unrealistic expectations of, of relationship, a blended family, things like that, yeah. I think those were, so when he said those today, he felt. 

00:07:20
PAUL Oh! 

00:07:25
ELLYN BADER So he did pretty well. 

00:07:25
TRISH Yeah. 

00:07:25
ELLYN BADER Okay, so he's been listening to you. 

00:07:25
TRISH Yeah. 

00:07:30
PETER PEARSON Is there, is there a part of you that appreciates that at least he's been listening? 

00:07:30
TRISH I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I do. 

00:07:35
PETER PEARSON Oh, what the heck. Go ahead and tell him right now. Just say, well I appreciate. 

00:07:40
TRISH I appreciate that you've been listening to me and you're very umm… good about communicating and trying to keep the lines of communication open. Talking about these things so clearly before, you know. 

00:07:45
PAUL Thank you. 

00:07:50
PETER PEARSON That's pretty cool. All right. 

00:07:50
TRISH We're lucky. 

00:07:55
PAUL Alright! We're done. 

00:07:55
ELLYN BADER Got to wrap this one and take out now before you get into any heavy stuff. 

00:08:00
PETER PEARSON So okay, so okay, then we'll switch and so you think Paul's major complaints in these areas, Trish about you are what? 

00:08:10
TRISH I don't know if he would say this but it would be to do things that umm… exclude him or leave him out or actually hurt him that I do these you things maybe without thinking umm… and a lot of it is around umm…, you know, me being a single mom and my kids and my little circle of world and my family and including him in that, so that's seems to come up again and again. So umm… that I do these things, I don't think, he thinks I did it on purpose but it comes out that way. So that's probably umm… 

00:08:45
PETER PEARSON Just to see, if I get this, are you saying that sometimes you make more unilateral decisions or without negotiation or checking out or something like that. Is that partly what you are saying? 

00:08:55
TRISH Right and maybe here, it's a habit of you know, being a single mom for all these years and being in my life with my kids. 

00:09:00
ELLYN BADER How many kids do you have? 

00:09:00
TRISH I have two kids. 

00:09:00
ELLYN BADER How old? 

00:09:05
TRISH Umm… 21 and gonna be 18 next week. 

00:09:10
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:09:10
ELLYN BADER And do they live with you? 

00:09:10
TRISH Umm… they live with us. 

00:09:10
PAUL Yeah. 

00:09:10
TRISH Right now. I mean, my son's away at college but he's home for the summer. My daughter is in her senior so. 

00:09:20
PETER PEARSON Okay. Any other thing, any other character, any other. 

00:09:25
TRISH I mean, I think I'll build on the expectations beside, that's been an issue with his would kids and my kids and his family and my family and trying to have it all and I think ideally that was wonderful but the reality is that, I, I had a harder time with it and I think now with time we realize it's not always umm… it'll be our expectations of what that should be is not the same anymore. 

00:09:50
PETER PEARSON So Paul, I might think your expectations are a little too what or not enough what? 

00:09:55
TRISH Umm… not where he wanted them to be soon enough. I mean this has been an ongoing thing in our life, as for me it'd been what seven years since we met about having our, our, our situation more together and more blended and more umm… and, and I've always been held, holding back more with my life and my kids and stuff that I think, yeah that has hurt him. 

00:10:20
PETER PEARSON So how would you summarize in there, that his complaint about you in this area is, you would say that Paul's complaint is. 

00:10:25
TRISH We haven't worked to be a couple. I haven't worked for us to be kind of united couple and our families to be more together and blended and… 

00:10:35
PETER PEARSON So that you haven't worked enough to be united and… 

00:10:40
TRISH Yeah. 

00:10:40
PETER PEARSON …team. 

00:10:40
TRISH And maybe don't see it the same way he does, what he wants and what I some what practical reasonable about happening. 

00:10:50
ELLYN BADER And your kids are how old? 

00:10:50
PAUL 23 and 21. My kids were adopted from Russia. Umm… they have attachment disorders. 

00:11:05
ELLYN BADER And are they living with you also? 

00:11:05
PAUL No, Andrew did for a summer umm… which is hard because of Andre and umm… you know, they're both uh… they both have you know they, big personality issues that made it hard to get along with people. Uh… sometimes it's wonderful and great, other times, it's not. So and it's a appropriate(ph) and 50-50. 

00:11:30
ELLYN BADER Okay, so they, right now, you need challenges. 

00:11:30
PAUL Right. 

00:11:35
PETER PEARSON How old were they, when they were adopted? 

00:11:35
PAUL Two years and six months, yeah. 

00:11:40
ELLYN BADER And were they adopted at the same time or? 

00:11:40
PAUL They were. 

00:11:40
ELLYN BADER Okay. So you took on two little ones all at once. 

00:11:40
PAUL Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:45
PETER PEARSON Anything else that you would add in general about a complaint that Paul might have about you? 

00:11:55
TRISH I think he thinks umm…, this might be usual that I'll let my kids get away with, with things or that I have kind of a different relationship that maybe he doesn't think is, I don't know if he's judgments about it. 

00:12:10
PAUL Like, your relationship with your kid? 

00:12:10
TRISH Yeah. 

00:12:15
PETER PEARSON So this is good. This is good that you're crafting your responses about listening you know, to Paul and maybe… in his eyes, you're a little what too lenient or? 

00:12:25
TRISH Too lenient and kind and maybe of kind of a, maybe too close of not normal relationship or something that. 

00:12:30
PETER PEARSON But this is your understanding. You're talking about your understanding of his complaint. 

00:12:35
TRISH Right, and I think because our relationships are so different in lot of ways, that it's hard, unable to understand each other's, I don't, I don't know, it's hard. 

00:12:45
PETER PEARSON Okay. So… anything you want to add because we're gonna check out with Paul. 

00:12:50
TRISH Oh, to what he doesn't, what he thinks? That I don't appreciate him enough, I can't leave that out. 

00:13:00
PETER PEARSON You said, you don't, you don't express it enough or you don't appreciate him enough or both? 

00:13:05
TRISH I think maybe both. A bit on express and a part maybe I uh… 

00:13:10
PETER PEARSON Because sometimes people appreciate but they don't express it. 

00:13:15
TRISH don't say it, might, I think, there is a lot of that. 

00:13:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

00:13:15
TRISH But I think he needs, here I can see it more. 

00:13:20
PETER PEARSON Uh… okay, so same question, how confident are you that Paul would say, way to go Trish, nailed it? 

00:13:30
TRISH Pretty, pretty high, eight, nine. 

00:13:30
PETER PEARSON Okay. Should we check it out? 

00:13:35
TRISH Sure. 

00:13:35
PETER PEARSON All right. 

00:13:40
PAUL All right so, yes, I think uh… uh… you heard me pretty well, I think the only other thing that I kind of said, in addition to umm… uh… is that what the, one thing I don't like in relationships is for them to get stale kind of for things that were, you know, all the things that you liked and enjoyed about each other, the kind of bunch it together and made stuff fun was for you know, to have, to have that energy dwindle and so. 

00:14:10
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:14:10
PAUL It's the only thing I, I had as a, you know, general concept and… 

00:14:15
ELLYN BADER Is that directed to both of you or directed mainly at Trish? 

00:14:20
PAUL Well, now, I joined the team to tell you the truth so. So, umm… which is why the complain about, you know, like you did more like, in terms of some point to help a little bit. 

00:14:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. So that's been a mutual endeavor, the and in the relationship, the couple energy has kind of gone downhill. Like both of you participated in that. 

00:14:40
PAUL Uh… yeah, I, I have I admit to that and I don't think that Trish had did it consciously or I think, I think just kind of but I think listening to what she said, I think you'd think, it's a that more natural thing to occur and that you know, the passion or whatever that you have earlier doesn't last forever and I'm more of a, you know, a big romantic and you know, saw a couple at a party and you know, some songs started and she was over in that side and he was over on that side. So like that's a song, you know. So, that's our song you know, we're coming together. 

00:15:15
PETER PEARSON Alright! 

00:15:15
ELLYN BADER You like that energy, you like that… 

00:15:20
PAUL I do, I like that energy. 

00:15:25
PETER PEARSON Yeah, that keeps you feeling alive. 

00:15:25
PAUL Yeah, absolutely! 

00:15:25
PETER PEARSON So she did a pretty damn good job of listening anyway… 

00:15:25
PAUL Yeah, yeah. 

00:15:30
PETER PEARSON So is there a part of you that appreciates that she has done listening, at least she has listened? 

00:15:35
PAUL Umm… yeah, there is a huge part of me that appreciates that because you know, I think Trish is an exceptional person in, in ways that there is not enough paper available to, to list in right, so and including the way that she cares about other people, myself included even though, we have these, you know, issues and points in time in general, you know, they can flair up but there is no doubt in my mind about, you know, who she is as a person and what she wants and feels about people. 

00:16:05
PETER PEARSON So, do you, do you want to just take a moment and express some appreciation to Trish for her willingness and her ability to listen to your struggles, complaints etc.? 

00:16:15
PAUL Yes, thank you for listening Trish. 

00:16:20
TRISH You're welcome. 

00:16:25
PETER PEARSON Trish, what do you do and you've kind of eluded this already, but what do you think you did that triggers in Paul feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated by you and vice versa? What do you think you do that triggers those feelings in Trish? 

00:16:40
TRISH Some of this is just little things just it's the closeness, physically and emotionally, he's big on holding hands and sitting close together and doing things that, in my past has never been that important to me although, umm…, you know, I learning. Umm… but I think… 

00:17:00
ELLYN BADER Does that mean you're learning to like it? 

00:17:05
TRISH Umm… a little bit of both. Umm… but I think uh… just you know showing appreciation for things when he does umm… discussing things before he makes decisions, including him and family decisions on you know, maybe my side of the family, making him feel part of that, listening to him, hearing him, I think those were the things and appreciating. I think those are the things that umm… makes him feel. 

00:17:35
PETER PEARSON Loved, valued, appreciated. Are there things that he does that you think he really likes to be appreciated for? 

00:17:45
TRISH You know when he helps with projects around the house or doing thing. 

00:17:45
PETER PEARSON Like that? 

00:17:45
TRISH Yeah. 

00:17:45
PETER PEARSON Yeah, to be noticed? 

00:17:45
TRISH Yeah. 

00:17:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah, he likes another boys who are those kind, so as kinds of acts of service. How confident are you that he's gonna say, ‘can't believe you Trish, you nailed it again'? 

00:18:00
TRISH I'm not so confident on that one. 

00:18:05
PETER PEARSON Not so confident about this one. Maybe about what? 

00:18:10
TRISH It is six or something, about, about being a big thing that makes him feel… 

00:18:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah about… 

00:18:15
TRISH …I, I think those things aren't as important as these bigger things that come up but maybe species, bigger things turn into uh… you know, full blown out problem but I don't know. 

00:18:25
PETER PEARSON That could be. 

00:18:25
TRISH Yeah. 

00:18:25
PETER PEARSON It could be. Should we check it out? 

00:18:25
TRISH Yeah. 

00:18:25
PETER PEARSON Okay. How did she do? 

00:18:30
PAUL You know, she's close. 

00:18:30
PETER PEARSON Okay. All right, all right. 

00:18:30
PAUL I think six is better, is you know… 

00:18:35
TRISH Yeah. 

00:18:35
PETER PEARSON You got the foundation, you got the foundation. 

00:18:40
PAUL In truth, I need a fewer big things than the little things which is you know, the day-to-day just like you know, we're close or we touch or kiss or pass or whatever it is, you know, all those things about umm… you know, and those little things that are just uh… you know the reinforcements right that, they're in one one, one uh… brick in the wall of us. 

00:19:10
PETER PEARSON What do you think, you do that triggers, feelings of loved and being valued and appreciated in, in Trish? 

00:19:20
PAUL You know like putting toothbrush on or toothpaste on the toothbrush you know, like or we do both of ours. You know, even though she's not there, you know, while I'm doing it and I do it for you and it's left for you and umm… that was unusual to her. 

00:19:35
TRISH Yeah, there is absolutely, no need for that. But, but I appreciate it now when I don't get toothpaste on my toothbrush. No, it's just, umm… yeah he's very thoughtful and I guess that's your romantic side that I don't. 

00:19:50
PAUL Well, You know what I mean? I'm doing it so I might as well do it for you too. Yeah. 

00:19:55
PETER PEARSON So how would you summarize what you do that triggers in Trish, in her feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated by you? 

00:20:00
PAUL Well, so when I was separating, I guess, which I think clarified was the things, I do that I want to do to state my love, value, appreciation of her which is not the stuff that she need. 

00:20:10
PETER PEARSON And that's the key. 

00:20:10
PAUL Right. 

00:20:10
PETER PEARSON We can't get what we want. 

00:20:15
PAUL Right. 

00:20:15
PETER PEARSON And supposed to find out what our partner wants and make it happen. 

00:20:15
PAUL Right. 

00:20:20
PETER PEARSON But it's human nature to give what we want. 

00:20:20
PAUL You know, she hasn't asked for much. She wont to ask for help. I don't see, don't know. 

00:20:25
PETER PEARSON That's interesting. Now maybe, there is a couple of possibilities and maybe Trish hasn't been very clear in expressing again and… so you don't know. Another is maybe she has expressed more but you didn't register or maybe she just says, I will try to be as self-reliant as I can, so I'm not going to be like that. 

00:20:50
TRISH I think the thing that hit me the most is that, you do things that you think that you likes, you do them. So if you're the romantic, you'll do more of those things which is that your tendency and your nature and that's so wonderful but I'm the practical one trying to you know, manage the household full-time and juggle kids and life and exercise and taking care of myself and all the things that I can fit into a day and you like to go to bed early and there is no way, I can go to bed early. I got 20 things on my list to do still so, so for me… I can see where there is a big difference, you know. 

00:21:25
ELLYN BADER Did you know, it was hard for him to know which then was really had to do the most? 

00:21:25
TRISH I think, it's hard for him to know what to do because, I just do it all but then recently I think sometimes I start venting that I get frustrated that I feel, you know, if you look at all the things I do, how much time that takes but I don't ask very often because I've put on my own as a single mom and really on my own. I think he's actually shocked realizing that I never had lived with people very long, I was single most of my life, married for a brief time enough to have two kids but then single again and so most of my, you know 40 years of adult life has been on my own taking care of myself. 

00:22:00
PETER PEARSON You really have polished that self-reliant part. 

00:22:05
(crosstalk) 

00:22:10
TRISH Because they might not be here tomorrow. 

00:22:10
ELLYN BADER Oh, you said that. 

00:22:15
(crosstalk) 

00:22:15
ELLYN BADER I am not going to depend on anybody. I wonder he's not sure… 

00:22:20
PETER PEARSON Well, apparently, you have chosen somebody, who likes connections about the practicality. 

00:22:30
TRISH Yes. 

00:22:30
PETER PEARSON So maybe there is a reason that a part of you chose the guy who likes to connect in those ways, even though, it's a challenge for you. 

00:22:45
TRISH Because, I really want them. 

00:22:45
PETER PEARSON Maybe, it's part of you does or did? Where do you find it? 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:22:55
TRISH Maybe, yeah. It's possibly, I may spend like you say ,so long and so deep, it's hard to even uh… connect to that. 

00:23:00
PETER PEARSON There is a part in him that really wants to connect that way and when it doesn't happen I think a part of him kind of feels lonely or kind of pushed back like this, you know, kind of distant and kind of alone, lonely I don't know whether that would be the right word. 

00:23:15
TRISH No, I've heard it many times. 

00:23:20
PAUL Oh yeah, I don't know if there is better word but you're on the right track. 

00:23:20
PETER PEARSON All right, okay. 

00:23:25
TRISH He's drawn it on paper with the circles fills up there or not, yeah and that part of that… 

00:23:35
PETER PEARSON Yes, he's kind of orbiting around. 

00:23:35
TRISH Right, not in that center core where he wants to be. 

00:23:40
PETER PEARSON Do you feel anything as we talk about these things Trish? 

00:23:45
TRISH I don't think I've ever sat down and taking the time to think about it like I am now and discussing it to see how umm… the effect it's gonna have on him and our relationship and I think it's probably that wants us to connect me closer but it's just all these patterns and years of behavior and stuff that's making it harder. 

00:24:05
PETER PEARSON What's the motivation for the part that would like to be closer? Why would that part like to be closer with him? 

00:24:10
TRISH I think that's the basis of all the human connection to feel closer to someone to feel understood, to feel proceed the valued to, you know, so I think long term when, I think we talk about ourselves, you know, being long term partners umm… that's something you want to, I would like to, you know, to cultivate and to, to grow and uh… 

00:24:35
PETER PEARSON When couples come in to the office, you share their struggle two major categories. One has to do with roles and responsibilities around the house. All the stuff that require for people to live together around you know, chores and finances and parent caring and the other area that couple struggle a little bit is the quality and the quantity of the emotional and sexual connection and… those are the two most common arenas that couples struggle with when they come in. It sounds like you guys are getting better around roles and responsibility. Would that be accurate? 

00:25:10
TRISH I think, I need to ask for help and I'll allow him to help and not be judgmental about the help. 

00:25:15
PETER PEARSON Do you feel anything when you say it? 

00:25:20
TRISH Actually, it's the truth, yeah, it's easier said than done now. 

00:25:20
PETER PEARSON Do you feel anxious when you say it? 

00:25:25
TRISH Umm… anxious because it's, yeah, it's hard to change if you've been in this way, you know. 

00:25:30
PETER PEARSON As you moved emotionally more connected and closer to Paul, it puts that a part of you at risk. That risk of being disappointed, that risk of depending on somebody, that risk of being let down. What else would you put, you're risking for? 

00:25:50
TRISH I think those things that you said that depending on someone that you could lose that, umm… get used to it and they're gone or something like that, you know, all those things. 

00:26:00
PETER PEARSON Yeah, Paul what are you thinking, your feeling as we talk about these things? 

00:26:05
PAUL I thought it was going pretty well. 

00:26:05
TRISH You're sitting on the sidelines here. 

00:26:10
PETER PEARSON What do you think Paul's initial attraction to you was about? 

00:26:15
TRISH What? You mean, initial when he first met me? 

00:26:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah, I'm talking to you, how do you guys were first together for those, those, you know, those glorious days, weeks, months, whatever. 

00:26:25
TRISH I thought, I think he thought I was interesting and fun and adventurous and I don't know. 

00:26:30
PAUL It was a Match.com so we don't rise from those love and I don't remember the emails or whatever the introductory step but we get together pretty quickly, right. 

00:26:40
PETER PEARSON But after you get together, there is got to be something where you say, let's meet again and again after that. So that's what I'm curious about. What do you think, he's saying, yeah, let's do this again. 

00:26:50
TRISH The first time. 

00:26:50
PAUL Yeah, yeah, first time. 

00:26:55
TRISH Had to throw that in. Umm… he broke up with me. It's devastating but I thought he was the right one and umm… yeah, for how long? Six months, eight months, something like that but anyway, yeah, but before that umm… 

00:27:10
ELLYN BADER Don't rush by that so fast that what happened, you, you got together. 

00:27:15
TRISH We dated for about a year, I don't know a while. 

00:27:20
ELLYN BADER And you were smitten? 

00:27:20
TRISH Yes. 

00:27:20
ELLYN BADER And then he broke up? 

00:27:20
TRISH Yes. 

00:27:25
ELLYN BADER And? 

00:27:25
TRISH That was over. 

00:27:25
ELLYN BADER And you were heart broken? 

00:27:25
TRISH Yes. 

00:27:30
ELLYN BADER Well, here you are letting yourself depend on somebody again and what was the reason he gave you? 

00:27:35
TRISH I think, he just, he just wasn't sure and he didn't, you know, he didn't never say, he loved me, so that was probably a big red flag. Umm… but then also just wasn't sure, what's right or I was the right person and wasn't fair to me and he needed to go, you know, date other people and I don't, that's kind of the gist of it, I don't remember. 

00:28:00
ELLYN BADER And then what happened for you? 

00:28:00
PAUL Well, it was actually pretty true. I was going to either cross a line and not, and not go back and umm… I wanted to make sure that, that was how I felt and what I wanted to do. So a few months later. 

00:28:20
TRISH More than a few months later. 

00:28:20
PAUL It wasn't, about six months, maybe? 

00:28:25
TRISH Yeah, probably six, eight months or something. 

00:28:25
PAUL By then I was pretty sure that this is what I wanted to do and we talked and essentially, we had conversation which is that, yeah, you probably don't know, if you can trust me now, given that and I said, so, you know, I understand and agree and but I'm here because I want to be and, and I realize that, it's gonna take your time to understand that and, so… you know, I need to prove it to you and so and then we, we start seeing each other again. 

00:29:00
ELLYN BADER Within that time that you were apart, you were grieving a loss or you were? 

00:29:05
TRISH Yeah, I mean, I, I was because it felt, you know, I think as you get older in life and you date a lot of people, I mean there are, you know, it's hard to find someone that you feel connected with the right person and it was just devastating 

00:29:20
ELLYN BADER devastating, is painful and umm… during that time, you were apart, it seems like you were figuring it out, is she the right person or are there other people and you were kind of wanting to be sure, you were all the way in and you were letting go. 

00:29:35
The PAPER Exercise 

00:29:35
ELLYN BADER Trish, this piece of paper represents something important to you. and I like you to take a minute and think about what it represents to you and it can be anything except for your kids and your marriage. Just think about what it represents to you and this piece of paper represents something important to you. And I would like you to take a minute and think about what it represents to you and then what I'm gonna ask you to do is hold the piece of paper between you for a minute and I'm gonna give you up to five minutes to decide who gets the paper. Then you can do it verbally, you can do it non-verbally, you can do it anyway you want to. But at the end of the five minutes, and one of you have, has the paper without ripping or tearing it. We're gonna be quiet. 

00:30:25
PAUL All right, well, my first question is, umm… do you think there is anything that we can't work out with each other? 

00:30:35
TRISH No. I want to know, what your, your, what did you decide? 

00:30:35
PAUL It doesn't matter. 

00:30:40
TRISH what does it mean? I'm curious, I wanna know. It doesn't matter? 

00:30:45
PAUL No, because if we can work things out, then. 

00:30:45
TRISH Forget about the paper. It matters to me to know what, what you said. 

00:30:55
PAUL Well, I'll tell you that later but we'll have to tear the paper, it doesn't matter. Because if, if we can work stuff out then, umm… whatever umm… is important and I feel the same right, so that whatever is important to you, I'll help make it happen and… 

00:31:10
TRISH So if one of us gets the paper then what the other person doesn't, is what you're saying? 

00:31:15
PAUL Well, that's kind of why I said this is a fair question because I was gonna change the rules and I'm gonna say that just because I get what I want, it doesn't mean that you get what you want just because you get what you want, it doesn't mean I get what I want. 

00:31:25
TRISH I agree with that, so. 

00:31:30
PAUL All right, so you can have the paper. 

00:31:30
TRISH You can have it. Umm… yeah I mean, this is how our base is just uh… just a piece of paper. 

00:31:35
PAUL So one of us has to have the paper so I'll pass it to you, you have it and then we can… 

00:31:40
TRISH Okay. 

00:31:40
PAUL … think we'll stuff that later. 

00:31:40
TRISH Okay, then you're gonna tell me what are you're choice? What was it? What was it? 

00:31:45
PAUL Uh… play the guitar. 

00:31:50
TRISH Oh, I'm glad I have it. But no, I'll just let you play the guitar. It means a lot to you. 

00:32:00
PAUL Thank you. 

00:32:05
TRISH Interesting exercise. 

00:32:05
ELLYN BADER Are you finished? 

00:32:10
TRISH Well, I'm here, he did ask me what mine was but I guess we're finished, I mean… 

00:32:15
PAUL Well, because for the paper exercise. 

00:32:15
TRISH Okay. 

00:32:20
ELLYN BADER What's your first emotional response to it, where it ended it? 

00:32:25
TRISH I think the big emotional response is that he didn't care what mine was. 

00:32:30
ELLYN BADER And now you're feeling that goes with that as what? 

00:32:30
TRISH That he doesn't, yeah, it just makes me sad, it makes me feel like he doesn't really and that was the first thing, I wanted to know, I didn't care about the piece of paper. That's a big deal, you know, other than your kids and your partner should be just like the biggest deal in your life. 

00:32:50
ELLYN BADER So you're holding the paper and feeling sad holding the paper. What are you feeling? 

00:32:55
PAUL Well, before her answer, I felt great because to me it's an affirmation of our relationship and that we'll work things out and you know, I trust her to do that. 

00:33:05
ELLYN BADER So you're feeling good as an affirmation strength and… 

00:33:10
PAUL Not an affirmation of us. Strength in the relationship, not strength of me or anything. 

00:33:15
TRISH I think, it's very typical that I either he expresses or I want to find out what he wants. So I'm not even dealing with, whatever I want, I'm dealing with five other things. That feels like very calming to me. 

00:33:25
PAUL Yeah, it's a good point. 

00:33:30
TRISH Umm…, so I don't even know what I want because, im trying to appease everyone else. 

00:33:35
ELLYN BADER Yeah, so you're so externally cued in and trying to pay attention to what does he want, what do my kids want umm… that you don't ask you're self. 

00:33:40
TRISH I cant please everyone and it's often very frustrating. 

00:33:45
ELLYN BADER And it would have meant in this case, it would have meant a lot to you, what Paul said, "hey, what is that you really want Trish?" Because that's hard for you to get there. 

00:33:55
PAUL It doesn't feel fair to me though because umm… the… in this case, umm… you know, I, uh… it was my action not to ask in the, in the real world, I do ask in fact, I kind of try to insist and point her to, what do you want. Well forget about them or forget about me, what do you want? 

00:34:15
ELLYN BADER It's hard for you to know yourself really well when you're caught up with a lot of other people. Umm… and that showed up in this exercise right now umm… because, how hard would have been for you to not let it finish, to say to Paul well, wait a minute, I really do want you to ask me right now, I do care for you to ask me what the paper meant to me. 

00:34:45
TRISH I know it would have been hard to me as far. 

00:34:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:50
ELLYN BADER So you would, you would really like him to ask you? 

00:34:55
TRISH Umm…, you know, I would have liked him to ask me a couple of minutes to go I think. Now that we've done all those thing, it's like okay, but it's, I think that we just had a different, you know… 

00:35:05
PAUL A different way of thinking about. 

00:35:10
TRISH Different way of thinking about at the time. 

00:35:10
ELLYN BADER And it's not, it's not a problem to have a different way of thinking about but I think one of the things that's showing up is a challenge for you and that challenge is can I really get in touch with myself, can I represent who I am in the face of kids needs or Paul's needs or family needs? Can I first of all can I take the time to even internally figure it out and to really pay attention and then if you do pay attention to say it, to hold onto it, to keep it present, active part of the conversation umm… and not the kind of disappear a little bit up. 

00:35:55
TRISH That's true and I actually, I'm thinking a lot of conversations, I feel like they are more focused on Paul's needs and issues and things because, maybe mine aren't so strong or so clear. 

00:36:10
ELLYN BADER But you don't let them get to the point of strength and clarity. Umm… Would you do an experiment for a minute and just see what it feels like? 

00:36:20
TRISH Sure. 

00:36:25
ELLYN BADER Would you say to Paul, you know, Paul, one of the ways, I really like to depend on you and one thing you do for me that really matters a lot is when you do try to figure out what I care about, when you do want to know what the paper represents to me, when you, when you really put in that energy to notice me, that means a lot. 

00:36:50
TRISH Okay. Paul, my umm…, I think it really matters to me umm… for you, let's see, umm… it's harder to do. Umm… but I think the crux is that, that umm… it matters to me that you care about what I'm thinking and wanting umm… which is not always clear to me but it matters that you want to know that. 

00:37:25
ELLYN BADER What does it feel to, for you to even say that to him? 

00:37:30
TRISH It felt weird and awkward. Just didn't come up at the top of my head. 

00:37:30
ELLYN BADER Okay. 

00:37:35
TRISH At all and I have to umm… because I don't do it very often. 

00:37:35
ELLYN BADER Right, right. 

00:37:40
TRISH Know, how to do it. 

00:37:40
ELLYN BADER So actually, you just put it in your own words. Say, say to Paul you know, Paul, I don't do this very often, I don't know, how to do this very well. Uh…Start there. 

00:37:50
TRISH I, I think it's in the beginning this was hard because I don't even know how to, how to do it but I think because I don't umm… ask for these kinds of things very often not even clear how to do it but I really like it umm… and I'd appreciate it when you want to know what I'm thinking and feeling and ask me and trying to kind of get, all the superficial to see what's really important to me. 

00:38:15
ELLYN BADER Will you just tell him what the paper did represent to you? 

00:38:20
TRISH Oh, do you want to know? 

00:38:20
PAUL I would love to know. 

00:38:25
TRISH It umm… it was just umm… making a difference. 

00:38:30
PAUL Oh! You can have that. That's more important to me. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:40
PAUL And so, I'd like to say umm… thank you for telling me that you actually want me to be a pain to attitude. 

00:38:50
TRISH Sometimes. 

00:38:55
PAUL To make in this one way, to make you, to get under, you know, whatever is going on to get your real umm…, what you really want and what you really and I'm happy to do that. 

00:39:10
TRISH Thank you. Sometimes, I'm not even clear what I want. It takes me a while to figure it out. 

00:39:15
PAUL Yeah. 

00:39:15
ELLYN BADER What are you feeling Trish? 

00:39:15
TRISH I'm feeling heard and validated and umm… clearer onto my, my issues, I think. 

00:39:30
ELLYN BADER So many times when couples get together, we move too fast. We think, we know, we move quickly or you have different agendas. That's life that happens many, many times over and especially when you're managing kids and, you know, all of that. You're on the role of, do you think, there is anything we can't work out and you were focused on the process and being confident in your process and Trish was focused on really wanting to know what you wanted and also wanting to share what she wanted. So you were on a different wave length which could happen easily. It takes being able to really listen to yourself first of all so that you don't let it drop at the end but you say to Paul, wait, I did want to tell you and it really does matter to me and you are moving too fast for me there because I don't want this to be over yet. Umm… and when we meet next time and we talk about family issues or the lending issues and things that are hard for you guys, part of what we are gonna do is really talk about how you slow down and have only one person decide at a time. So that you really do feel listen to you, you do feel heard, you do know what's like you said underneath, you know, what's driving it because much better solutions then come when you truly take the time umm… and only do one person side at a time, so that you know what matters deeply to each other. And too often couples just move way, way, way too fast and give themselves up quickly but it comes back later in ways that perhaps result in you saying, okay, I'll just be independent. And the part of you is comfortable there. But another part did chose Paul and does want to be with him and you say, do you want to know what mattered, what more you really go after the learning about her in this way, that really matters. That probably matters more to her than holding hands even though she likes the holding hands because nobody has taken the time or shown much interest and she said, years of raising kids where she has put all her attention and focus on them and to have you genuinely deeply interested in her is very, very meaningful. 

00:42:05
PETER PEARSON What do you feel as you hear Ellyn describe what she is saying? 

00:42:10
TRISH It's pretty right on, ten out of ten. 

00:42:15
PETER PEARSON And the emotion is what? 

00:42:15
TRISH Umm… uh… I've mixed emotions, I think. I'm kind of validated a little bit and heard and understood and clarity, a lot of different feelings, social feelings actually that umm… yeah I think the biggest has been validated and heard. 

00:42:45
ELLYN BADER You look a little teary-eyed. 

00:42:50
TRISH Yeah, because it's pretty, it's pretty big. I mean kind of hearing it really umm… having gotten there between us before, it's kind of new insight that feel very true and profound to me. 

00:43:05
PETER PEARSON And Paul, what do you think and feel as you were listening to what Ellyn was saying? 

00:43:10
PAUL Well, I feel more connected in the process and connected to Trish because umm… uh… I, I don't think she wants anybody know. What she really want and so the fact that she wants me to know that is a big deal. 

00:43:30
ELLYN BADER And you tell her, tell her, tell her. 

00:43:40
PAUL I think that umm… this is, I appreciate how hard this has been for you and I think that you umm… uh… don't let others know what you really want and think and you do so much for other people umm… and I think the fact that you're willing, that you're not only willing to ultimately share but you want me to help you share with me the, the things that you really want need. You know, you're a real person's feelings and thoughts. Umm…, you know, I don't think there is any closer to get in that. So. 

00:44:15
TRISH Thank you. 

00:44:20
PETER PEARSON And you're feeling what Trish? 

00:44:20
TRISH Very heard, validated, cared for, loved, yeah, yeah.

ELLYN BADER Hello, I'm Ellyn Bader and this is my husband Peter Pearson. Today we would like to walk you through some important aspects of an initial session with a couple. We suggest that you consider watching the clinical pieces first. Watching them all the way through, today it's Paul and Trish. When we sat down with them, we knew nothing about them. It's important to us to structure the session in such a way to learn about the couple's development and about their presenting problem and what it represents about where they're stuck developmentally. You will see how we structure the process of getting to know them, learning about their history and getting some initial goals. You'll also learn about the paper exercise. This is an exercise originally created by Susan Campbell in her book, "The Couple's Journey". We've expanded that exercise and use it both diagnostically and as an intervention. So we thank you for joining us and let's get started. 

00:45:55
Trish & Paul 

00:45:55
Session # 1 

00:45:55
with commentary 

00:45:55
PETER PEARSON As we get started, how are you each feeling about being here even though we haven't done anything yet in terms of the content of what we will be getting into. Just the fact that here you are. We're getting started. 

00:46:10
TRISH Paul asked me in the car, are you nervous. I said, well, you know, if I was unknown but I'm up for it and I trust the process and we were not sure what we're gonna be getting into but I think, I'm, I'm not too bad, I'm good. 

00:46:20
PETER PEARSON Cool. 

00:46:25
PAUL And umm…, I have reasonable faith in, in the therapeutic process in counseling because I've had success with it in the past and I think I'm a communicator and like to talk about things in general so. 

00:46:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:40
PAUL Yeah, so I'm here happily so. 

00:46:40
ELLYN BADER Alright, it's great. 

00:46:45
PETER PEARSON So when you think about today, what will happen that would make each of you think, gosh I'm really glad that I showed up today? Two questions that I start with that, I have found to be really valuable questions. One which is, how are you feeling about being here today? It's very quick assessment about the motivation which I like to get up front really fast. Most of the time, one of couples will say, I'm nervous but I'm glad we're here. We need to be here. Sometimes one partner will say, I don't want to be here, I don't think, we need to be here. I don't believe in the whole process of therapy. It's really important for me to know that at the beginning, so that I treat that person a little bit more cautiously, a little bit more carefully, a little bit more respectfully and for sure, I do not ask that person to make the first shift in changing their relationship. Second, I have found that asking what would make it glad, what make you glad that you came today if it could happen? What I found sometimes is that, I will have what I would think would be exquisite, brilliant first initial interview that we couldn't get anymore in terms of insight, poignancy, emotions, connections and then at the end, one or the other person sometimes would say, well this was a really good session however we didn't cover or we didn't get to and I got uh…, jeez. So to keep that from happening, I like to know what would happen today if it could happen that would make you glad that you came? It accomplishes two things. One it gives me a micro goal for today, that's much more potentially achievable rather than the goal for coming into therapy which is we want a better relationship which is too vague and too general. So by asking what would happen today if it could happen that would make you glad? It then helps me refine and adjust if they have some outlandish goal like well, again today, I want to be able to trust that my partner will follow through with what they're gonna do. That I was saying that's too big of a chunk. Let's break it down to a smaller uh… piece that's much more achievable for today. So the question really helps me get help them, get a grip on what's more accomplishable, achievable in our session for today and we can build on that, then for the bigger picture of what they want to create by coming in. 

00:49:25
PAUL Two levels. Umm… the first level would be just that we approach the topic and got to a point of deeper understanding about it and actually, you know, felt that we understood each other a little better around it and then more personally, I would, on a second level, I would, I would clarify that as being her which is something we talk about sometimes. 

00:49:45
ELLYN BADER So you would like to walk away with an experience that she's heard something that you want to communicate. 

00:49:55
PAUL Right. Yeah and I'm, I'm more open to willing to listen to. 

00:49:55
ELLYN BADER But that's been an issue that you have not sure you've been heard. 

00:50:00
PAUL Sometimes, yeah. 

00:50:05
PETER PEARSON If you're fully heard Paul, what does that mean? 

00:50:05
PAUL You know, it's, it doesn't look like anything in particular to me. It feels like something more than it looks like, something. Whatever I want or think in any given situation doesn't have to be the way it winds up. It doesn't have to be my way or her way or anything like that but the concept of being heard means that was incorporating and the thinking and the planning, understood, valued and then umm…, and then you know, fairly discussed and collectively decided. 

00:50:30
PETER PEARSON And hopefully some, if corrective action was needed, some, something would happen on Trish's part that she might do something different, if you were really heard that was, if you really hit the bulls eye. 

00:50:45
PAUL You know, it depends on the thing because sometimes it's just about the process. 

00:50:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:50
ELLYN BADER But it's how she responds that makes the difference. 

00:50:55
PAUL Yeah, and, and response and I'd say contribute to the process. 

00:51:00
PETER PEARSON Okay. This is absolutely phenomenal, their responses. It's full of mush, it's full of ambiguity and it's full of goals for Trish as opposed to just a goal for Paul. He wants Trish to hear her, that's a goal, he wants to be heard which is a goal for Trish to hear him. He wants her to make certain adjustments after she hears him. So much of what he's saying at this part is really a goal for Trish and what makes it even more mushy or complex is he's not really sure what that, what should would have to do but he would feel it. Which makes it uh… really challenging for you, the therapist to figure out what it means by being heard, how he would know it. 

00:51:50
ELLYN BADER If I remember right, I think that you and I decided to go on but both of us knowing that at this point, we had very mushy goals. 

00:51:55
PETER PEARSON Totally mushy goals which sets the stage for an intervention that's coming up. 

00:52:05
ELLYN BADER How about you Trish? 

00:52:05
TRISH Response to him or just no more for myself. 

00:52:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, make this glad you're here today. 

00:52:10
TRISH Umm… yeah, I think things keep coming up which is around these issues between us that umm… I'm hoping by discussing them more here, we can resolve them to a point where they don't come up and become, you know bigger issues that cause umm… some conflict and a couple of days of being upset and not talking, you know, some of those kinds of things and I think both hurt feelings on both parts, so if we can get through some things where we don't keep having these things coming up. Somewhere, it feels like, you know, I feel like I've heard it and when I'm trying to explain my side but it's still how he feels. So I'm clearly I'm doing something wrong that I'm umm… not getting into the level and I think some of it I'm trying to explain where I am coming from, my side maybe I'm not feeling heard, you know or we're not hearing each other and then we are both hurt or feeling, you know, I feel like I can't win that you know we're gonna keep having these issues over and over again and that somehow, there is something beyond what I can do to ever make him feel umm… better about it. 

00:53:20
PETER PEARSON Okay, one of the most common things that couples who we respond with, when you ask for goals or objectives for what would make them glad they're there, they will say we, and we is a great cover up, most of the time meaning, my partner needs to do …. So she also said, would make me glad if in the future, we didn't have these struggles again, again that's a close to an, that know that is an impossible goal to have in this session. So we have a mushy, symbiotic goal, non-differentiated goal meaning, we should be able to do or we, I hope that we can…. In the, I think, in some other in an earlier stage of my evolution, working with couples where both people say, I don't feel heard, I was uh…, I would often go down the path of well, Paul why don't you tell Trish, what's important to you and Trish see if you can listen, ask questions and be curious about what you're saying with the hope that Paul would then feel heard. Well, most of the time, I discovered that didn't work very well. He still would not feel heard. So it leads to another way of helping them feel heard while we get more specific about what their problems and challenges are. And it comes in the form of asking each person, can you tell me what you think your partners main complaints about you are because that will help me, the therapist to see if, basically to see how well you guys have been listening to each other. And I say that to them, I say, this is a diagnostic question. I'm really curious, how well you've been listening to each other and it gives me an opportunity, also to understand what your challenges are. Again in the way that I used to work with couples for a long time, I would say why are you here and what do you hope to get out of being here or how can I help you? They would then respond by each listing complaints about their partner and that's really a painful thing. You just met somebody brand-new and within five or ten minutes of meeting somebody, your partner just rips you a new one by saying, how insensitive, how inconsiderate you are, is a shaming process, right from the get go. So I said, I really need a different way of understanding their problems, their challenges without saying, why are you here? What I came up with is, can you tell me what you think the main complaints that your partner has about you? I think in more conventional approach where a person is sitting in the chair's over here might say so, what are the issues you know, that you guys are struggling with? And… in the process of saying the issues are, there is a strong instinct to say, well, I think, I know where the problem on these issues is. So we might try something different which is… you might say on the issues that we struggle with. Here is what I think Paul's major complaints about me are and Paul would say well, I think here is what Trish's major complaints about me are. It's kind of a diagnostic question. At least at the beginning, it will help us understand how well you guys have been listening to each other. So… it doesn't matter who goes first because, you both get a chance to say, here is what I think the major complaints about me are. 

00:57:15
PAUL Do you?. 

00:57:15
TRISH We'll start. 

00:57:20
PAUL Okay. I think Trish would say about me that I'm too sensitive and that my uh… expectations get or you know, sometimes are unrealistic that the reality situation makes little harder. 

00:57:35
PETER PEARSON Okay. Uh… anything else in addition to those two things? 

00:57:40
PAUL Trish has been feeling that I haven't that umm… I don't help enough. 

00:57:45
ELLYN BADER Help with what? 

00:57:50
PAUL You know, day chores. 

00:57:50
TRISH Household. 

00:57:55
ELLYN BADER Household chores. 

00:57:55
PETER PEARSON Responsibilities, roles and responsibilities in the house, just to make things work a little easier on a roof. On a scale of 1 to 10, with ten being high confidence, because we're gonna ask Trish so you know, how did you, how confident are you that Trish will say, you nailed it Paul. 

00:58:10
ELLYN BADER So Peter asked the question on a 1 to 10 scale. How confident are you that you're getting it correct and Peter, do you want to say a little bit about why you want to know if they're on that scale 1 to 10, how correct they think they are? 

00:58:25
PETER PEARSON I love that question which is how confident are you that you got it right and, and there for some reason, people want to prove they're good listeners that they got it right and they go, oh man, it's like uh…, I think I got this like an eight or nine and then I'll say uh… great let's check it out, shall we? And they always say, yes, let's check it out and then they look to their partner and it, it they've just said here, here is how I think I'm a really ineffective partner. Now I'm gonna find out if I was right and it's amazing because, they, they listen with interest about what their partner is going to say. Most of the time, the partner will say, you know, you either nailed it or that's really close. And when they say, it was really close, I'll then say to the person, are you interested in what you missed? And so far, it's like 98% will say, yeah, what did I miss? And they are eager now to understand from their partner's perspective what they did was effective. 

00:59:35
PAUL I'll take eight. 

00:59:40
PETER PEARSON About an eight. Shall we check it out. 

00:59:40
PAUL Yeah. 

00:59:40
ELLYN BADER How do you do? 

00:59:45
TRISH The first two, I was gonna say something of too sensitive but it's also a little bit more for me, it's like taking it personally that I did something purposely to hurt him or leave him out. So I just expand on that a little bit about the sensitive and the other one was… 

01:00:00
PETER PEARSON The expectations. 

01:00:00
PAUL Sensitive and realistic. 

01:00:05
ELLYN BADER A realistic expectation. 

01:00:05
TRISH Oh, yes and that was, yes, thank you. Umm… the unrealistic expectations of, of relationship, abundant family things like that, yeah. I think those were, so when he said two, he felt. 

01:00:15
PETER PEARSON Oh! 

01:00:20
ELLYN BADER So he did pretty well. Okay, so he's been listening to you. 

01:00:20
TRISH Yeah. 

01:00:20
PETER PEARSON Is there, is there a part of you that appreciates that at least he's been listening? 

01:00:25
TRISH I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I do. 

01:00:30
PETER PEARSON Oh what the heck. Go ahead and tell him right now. Just say, well I appreciate. 

01:00:35
TRISH I appreciate that you've been listening to me and you're very good about communicating and trying to keep the lines of communication open. Talking about these things so clearly before, you know. 

01:00:45
PETER PEARSON Now this is what's really interesting which is in a few minutes, without spending a whole lot of effort on my part, they're having a comfortable dialogue. Trish says, wow, he's been listening. I have been heard which is a different model than having her tell Paul what the problems are and then Paul trying to recapping it away to communicate that he understands. I have found this to be a much more elegant way of somebody getting, well, I guess my partner was listening to me and actually it feels pretty good and then I say, well give them some strokes. Give them a compliment for listening to you. So instead of feeling like people are carving each other up, they're now giving strokes for being heard. It totally changes the ambience in the room. 

01:01:40
ELLYN BADER And the strokes are very real and enforcing. 

01:01:40
PETER PEARSON Totally. That's pretty cool. All right. 

01:01:40
TRISH We're lucky. 

01:01:45
PAUL So we're done here. 

01:01:50
ELLYN BADER Got to wrap this up and take home now before we get into any heavy stuff 

01:01:55
PETER PEARSON So, okay so okay, then we'll switch and so you think Paul's major complaints in these areas, Trish about you are what? 

01:02:00
TRISH I don't know if he would say this but it would be to do things that umm… exclude him or leave him out or actually hurt him that I do these you things maybe without thinking. Umm… and lot of it is around umm…, you know, me being a single mom and my kids and my little circle of world and my family and including him in that so that's seems to come up again and again. So umm… that I do these things, I don't think, he thinks I did it on purpose but it comes out that way. So that's probably. Umm… 

01:02:35
PETER PEARSON Just to see, if I get this. Are you saying that sometimes you make more unilateral decisions or without negotiation or checking out or something like that. Is that partly what you are saying? 

01:02:50
TRISH Right and maybe here, it's a habit of being a single mom for all these years and being in my life with my kids. 

01:02:55
ELLYN BADER How many kids do you have? 

01:02:55
TRISH I have two kids. 

01:02:55
ELLYN BADER And they are how old? 

01:02:55
TRISH Umm… 21 and gonna be 18 next week. 

01:03:00
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

01:03:00
ELLYN BADER Do they live with you? 

01:03:05
TRISH Umm… they live with us. 

01:03:05
PAUL Yeah. 

01:03:05
TRISH Right now. I mean, my son's away at college but he's home for the summer. My daughter is in her senior so. 

01:03:10
PETER PEARSON Okay. Any other thing, any other character, any other. 

01:03:15
TRISH I mean, I think I'll build on the expectations, because I think that's been an issue with his two kids and my kids and his family and my family and trying to have it all and I think ideally that was wonderful but the reality is that, I, I had a harder time with it and I think now with time we realize it's not always umm… it'd be our expectations to what that should be is not the same anymore. 

01:03:40
PETER PEARSON So Paul, I might think your expectations are a little too what, or not enough what? 

01:03:50
TRISH Umm… not where he wanted them to be soon enough. I mean this has been an ongoing thing in our relationship maybe what seven years since we met about having our, our, our situation more together and more blended and more umm… and I've always been held, holding back more with my life and my kids and stuff that I think has hurt him. 

01:04:05
PETER PEARSON So how would you summarize his complaints about you in this area is you would say that Paul's complaint is. 

01:04:20
TRISH We haven't worked to be a couple. I haven't worked for us to be kind of united couple and our families to be more together and blended in. 

01:04:30
PETER PEARSON You haven't worked enough to be a united. 

01:04:35
TRISH Yeah and maybe don't see it the same way he does, what he wants and what I, some what practical reasonable about happening. 

01:04:40
ELLYN BADER Your kids are how old? 

01:04:45
PAUL 23 and 21. My kids are adopted from Russia. They have attachment disorders. 

01:04:55
ELLYN BADER And are they living with you also? 

01:04:55
PAUL No, Andre did for summer which is hard because of Andre and umm… you know, they're both uh… they both have you know they, big personality issues that made it hard to get along with people. Uh… sometimes it's wonderful and great and other times, it's not. So and it's a appropriate(ph) 50-50. 

01:05:20
ELLYN BADER Okay, so they, right now, you need challenges. 

01:05:25
PAUL Right. 

01:05:25
PETER PEARSON How old were they when they were adopted? 

01:05:25
PAUL Two years and six months, yeah. 

01:05:30
PETER PEARSON It's always a challenge how to balance what's going on with the process versus how much historical information to collect at any given moment. And it's really a judgment at the time when you do this. Uh… we like to be kind of fluid and go back and forth and not have a set of rules about when we collect historical information versus when do we keep going straight ahead with the process. It's a judgment that I think you the therapist get more skillful as you get more experienced about just leaving it back and forth. 

01:06:05
ELLYN BADER And one thing we'll be getting to learn here is that they have a blended family, they each have two kids and that they came into that with some different expectations of what it would mean to create a blended family. And were they adopted at the same time or? 

01:06:20
PAUL They were. 

01:06:20
ELLYN BADER Okay. So you took on two little ones all at once. 

01:06:25
PAUL Yes, yeah. 

01:06:30
PETER PEARSON Anything else that you would add in general about a complaint that Paul might have about you? 

01:06:35
TRISH I think, he thinks umm…, this one be unusual that my kids get away with, with things or that I have kind of a different relationship that maybe he doesn't think is, I don't know if his judgments in that. 

01:06:50
PAUL Like, relationship with your kid? 

01:06:50
TRISH Yeah. 

01:06:55
PETER PEARSON So this is good. This is good that you're crafting your responses about listening with Paul and maybe in his eyes, you're a little what too lenient or? 

01:07:05
TRISH Too lenient and kind of a maybe too close of a not normal relationship or something that. 

01:07:15
PETER PEARSON But this is your understanding. You're talking about your understanding of his. 

01:07:15
TRISH Right, and I think because our relationships are so different in a lot of ways, that it's hard to understand each other's, I don't, I don't know, it's hard. 

01:07:25
PETER PEARSON Okay. So… anything you want to add because we're gonna check out with Paul. 

01:07:35
TRISH Oh, to what he doesn't, what he thinks. That I don't appreciate him enough, I can't leave that out. 

01:07:40
PETER PEARSON You said, you don't, you don't express it enough or you don't appreciate him enough or both? 

01:07:45
TRISH I think maybe both. A bit on express part maybe I uh… 

01:07:55
PETER PEARSON Because sometimes people appreciate but they don't express… 

01:07:55
TRISH Don't say it, I think, there is a lot of that. 

01:07:55
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

01:08:00
TRISH But I think he needs, hear it and see it more. 

01:08:05
PETER PEARSON Ah… okay so same question, how confident are you that Paul would say, way to go Trish, nailed it? 

01:08:10
TRISH Pretty, pretty high, eight, nine. 

01:08:15
PETER PEARSON Okay. Should we check it out? 

01:08:15
TRISH Sure. 

01:08:15
PETER PEARSON All right. 

01:08:20
PAUL All right so, yes, I think uh… uh… you heard me pretty well, I think the only other thing that I kind of said, in addition to umm… uh… is that what the, one thing I don't like in relationships is for them to get stale kind of for things that were, you know, all the things that you liked and enjoyed about each other, the kind of bunch it together and made stuff fun was for you know, to have, to have that energy dwindle and so. 

01:08:50
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

01:08:50
PAUL It's the only thing I, I had as a, you know, general concept and. 

01:08:55
ELLYN BADER Is that directed to both of you or directed mainly at Trish? 

01:09:00
PAUL Well, now, I joined the team to tell you the truth so. So, umm… which is why the complain about, you know, like you did more like in terms of some point to help a little bit. 

01:09:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah, so that's been a mutual endeavor, the, and in the relationship, the couple energy has kind of gone downhill. Like both of you have participated in that. 

01:09:20
PAUL Uh… yeah, I, I have I admit to that and I don't think that Trish had did it consciously or do you think, I think just kind of but I think listening to what she said, I think you'd think, it's a more natural thing to occur and that you know and the passion or whatever the job really or doesn't last forever and I more of a, you know, a big romantic and you know, saw a couple at a party and you know some songs started and she was over in that side and he was over on that side. So like that's our song, you know. We're coming together. 

01:10:00
PETER PEARSON Right. 

01:10:00
ELLYN BADER You like that energy. 

01:10:00
PAUL We do, I like that energy. 

01:10:00
PETER PEARSON That keeps you feeling alive. 

01:10:05
PAUL Yeah, absolutely. 

01:10:05
ELLYN BADER As the two of them are talking about the decrease in energy and it's very calming for couples to say well the passion goes away with time. What they don't realize often is that their pattern, the symbiotic patterns that they have between them can also contribute enormously to the decreasing intensity because the way they interact with each other is a way interacting that stifles the intensity coming to the surface. 

01:10:35
PETER PEARSON So she did a pretty damn good job of listening anyway. So is there a part of you that appreciates that she has done listening, at least she has listened? 

01:10:45
PAUL Umm… yeah, there is a huge part of me that appreciates that because you know, I think Trish is an exceptional person in, in ways that there is not enough paper available to, to list and write so and including the way that she cares about other people, myself included even though, we have these, you know, issues and points in time in general, you know, they can flair up but there is no doubt in my mind about, you know, who she is as a person and what she wants and feels about people. 

01:11:15
PETER PEARSON So do you want to just take a moment and express some appreciation to Trish for her willingness and her ability to listen to your struggles, complaints etc.? 

01:11:30
PAUL Yes. Thank you for listening Trish. 

01:11:35
TRISH You're welcome. 

01:11:35
PETER PEARSON It's kind of interesting at this point, just a handful of minutes in the session, each person now has had at least a first pass that their partner has heard them and that was one of their original goals coming in. I would like to be heard by my partner. And what we've done without a whole lot of work on our part Ellyn and me umm… they've heard each other and acknowledge that they have been heard without a lot of effort and that's one of the things that can make couple's therapy a lot easier. 

01:12:10
ELLYN BADER It also looks like they feel understood because the person is feeding it back in a way that shows that knowing that I can repeat the words but I seem to have understood what it is that we're talking about. 

01:12:20
PETER PEARSON Not just in today's session but here is some demonstration that I've been listening to on the home front, honey. Trish, what do you do and you've kind of eluded this already. But what do you think you did that triggers in Paul feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated by you and vice versa? What do you think you do that triggers those feelings in Trish? We've taken care of the first chunk uh… a couple struggles which is their complaints about each other and done it in a way that's a little bit smoother than way I used to do it. So couple's therapy often involve two major things. What do I need to do a whole lot lesser and what can I do a lot more of. So this way of asking a question, what do you do that triggers feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated in your partner. I'm really looking for their love languages, their core strokes, what, how well do they know what they do that really triggers those feelings in their partner. This is kind of an interesting question because often couples are more clear on what they do that's a problem for their partner and less clear on what they do that can trigger feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated in the other person. So I'm really looking for at a high level what would be good for them to stop doing, what would be good for them to do more of or start doing. 

01:13:55
TRISH Some of these are just little things just is the closeness, physically and emotionally, he's big on holding hands and sitting close together and doing things in my past has never been that important to me although, umm…, you know, I'm learning. Umm… but I think… 

01:14:15
ELLYN BADER Does that mean you're learning to like it? 

01:14:20
TRISH Umm… a little bit of both. Umm… but I think uh… just you know showing appreciation for things when he does umm… discussing things before he makes decisions, including him and family decisions on, you know, maybe my side of the family, making him feel part of that, listening to him with those other things and appreciating. I think those are the things that umm… makes him feel. 

01:14:50
PETER PEARSON Loved, valued, appreciated. When I ask couples what do you do that you think triggers in your partner feelings of being loved, value and appreciated? If Ellyn says, "well, here is what I think I do that triggers in Pete," he really feels loved when I do … I will then feel like she has heard me, she has listened and I don't have to say the dreaded word to Ellyn which is I need you to do because when couples say I need you, it, it usually comes across as a form of demand and then the other person complies as opposed to giving a gift to their partner. When you tell your partner what you need from them, which is generally interpreted as a coercion into what do you think, you do and then let's check it out to see how accurate that is and can add to it. So I really, really want to get away from that dreaded question of will you tell your partner what it is that you need from them. Are there things that he does that you think he really liked to be appreciated for? 

01:16:05
TRISH You know, when he helps with projects around the house or doing thing. Yeah. 

01:16:10
PAUL To be noticed. 

01:16:10
TRISH Yeah. 

01:16:15
PETER PEARSON He likes that of boys who are kind, kinds of acts of service. How confident are you that he's gonna say, ‘can't believe you Trish, you nailed it again?' 

01:16:25
TRISH I'm not so confident on that one. 

01:16:25
PETER PEARSON Not so confident on this one. Maybe that will a whole lot. 

01:16:30
TRISH Six or something. About being a big thing that makes him feel… 

01:16:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah about. 

01:16:35
TRISH I, I think those things aren't as important as these bigger thing that come up but maybe bigger things turn into you know, full blown out problem but I don't know. 

01:16:45
PETER PEARSON That could be. 

01:16:45
TRISH Yeah. 

01:16:45
PETER PEARSON It could be. Should we check it out. 

01:16:50
TRISH Yeah. 

01:16:50
PETER PEARSON Okay. How did she do? 

01:16:50
PAUL You know, she's close. 

01:16:55
PETER PEARSON Okay. All right, all right. 

01:16:55
PAUL I think six is better, is you know. 

01:16:55
TRISH Yeah. 

01:16:55
PETER PEARSON You got the foundation, you got the foundation. 

01:17:00
PAUL In truth, I need a fewer big things than the little things which is you know, the day-to-day just like you know, we're close or we touch or kiss or pass or whatever it is, you know, all those things about umm… you know and those little things that are just uh… you know the reinforcements right that, they're in you know, one, one uh… brick in the wall of us. 

01:17:35
PETER PEARSON What do you think, you do that triggers feelings of love and being valued and appreciated in Trish? 

01:17:40
PAUL You know like putting toothbrush on, toothpaste on the toothbrush you know, like or we do both of ours. You know, even though she's not there, you know, while I'm doing it and I do it for you and it's left for you. And umm… that was unusual to her. 

01:17:55
TRISH Yeah, there is absolutely no need for that. But, but I appreciate it now when I don't get toothpaste on my toothbrush. But no, it's just, umm… it's very thoughtful and I guess that's your romantic side that I don't. 

01:18:10
PAUL Well, you know what I mean? I'm doing it so I might as well do it for you too. Yeah. 

01:18:15
PETER PEARSON So how would you summarize what you do that triggers in Trish, in her feelings of being loved, valued and appreciated by you? 

01:18:25
PAUL Well, so when I was separating I guess which I think clarified was the things, I do that I want to do to state my love, value, appreciation of her which is not the stuff that she need. 

01:18:30
PETER PEARSON And that's the key. 

01:18:35
PAUL Right. 

01:18:35
PETER PEARSON We can't get what we want. 

01:18:35
PAUL Right. 

01:18:35
PETER PEARSON As opposed to find out what our partner wants and make it happen. 

01:18:40
PAUL Right. 

01:18:40
PETER PEARSON But it's human nature to give what we want. The thing that came out that Trish was so insightful about is that Paul will give what he wants which is often true for couples. It's really a marker, a measure of low other differentiation because I can't see my partner who they are. So we end up giving to our partner what we would like for ourselves and that's actually quite common uh… for a lot of couples to do. They give a lot, give a lot and then wonder why their partners not appreciative for how much they give. 

01:19:20
PAUL You know, she hasn't asked for much. She wont ask for help. I don't see, don't know. 

01:19:25
PETER PEARSON That's interesting. Now, maybe there is a couple of possibilities and maybe Trish hasn't been very clear and expressing again and so you don't know. Another is maybe she has expressed more than you could register or maybe she just says, I will try to be as self-reliant as I can so I'm not going to be like that. 

01:19:50
TRISH I think the thing that hit me the most is that you do things that you think that you like, you do them. If you're the romantic, you'll do more of those things which is that your tendency and your nature and that's so wonderful but I'm the practical one trying to you know manage the household full-time and juggle kids and life and exercise and taking care of myself and all the things that I can fit into a day and you like to go to bed early and there is no way, I can go to bed early. I got 20 things on my list to do. So, so for me, I can see where there is a big difference, you know. 

01:20:20
ELLYN BADER Did you know it was hard for him to know which then was really touched you the most? 

01:20:25
TRISH I think, it's hard for him to know what to do, because, I just do it all but then recently I think sometimes I start venting that I get frustrated that I feel like, you know, if you look at all the things I do, how much time that takes but I don't ask very often because I've put on my own as a single mom and really on my own. I think he's actually shocked realizing that I never lived with people very long, I was single most in my life, married for a brief time enough to have two kids but then single again and so most of my, you know, 40 years of adult life has been on my own taking care of myself. 

01:20:55
PETER PEARSON You really have polished that self-reliant part. 

01:21:05
TRISH I have. Because they might not be here tomorrow. 

01:21:10
ELLYN BADER Oh, you said that. I am not going to depend on anybody. One of Trish's issue is really beginning to show up here where she says, I've been on my own, I like to be independent, I'm not going to depend on anybody. Umm…, you know, she's spent most of the last years as a single mom, single parent and she's laughing here but it's really not funny because she is really quite afraid of depending on Paul. 

01:21:45
(crosstalk) 

01:21:50
PETER PEARSON Well, apparently, you have chosen somebody who likes connection above the practicality. 

01:21:55
TRISH Yes. 

01:22:00
PETER PEARSON So maybe there is a reason that a part of you chose the guy who likes to connect in those ways, in a challenge for you. 

01:22:10
TRISH Because, I really want them. 

01:22:10
PETER PEARSON Maybe, it's part of you does or did, what do you point at? 

01:22:20
TRISH Umm… maybe, yeah. It's possibly and I spent like you say so long and so deep it's hard to even uh… connect to that. 

01:22:30
PETER PEARSON There is a part in him that really wants to connect that way and when it doesn't happen I think a part of him kind of feels lonely or kind of pushed back like this, you know, kind of distant and kind of alone, lonely, I don't know whether that would be the right word. 

01:22:45
TRISH No, I've heard it many times. 

01:22:45
ELLYN BADER Here Pete is doing a good job probing and exposing what's hard for her to acknowledge, her desire for connection in her variable style she's very self-protected and has difficulty letting him know that she does want to rely on him and that he is important and does matter to her. 

01:23:05
PETER PEARSON At some point we're gonna have to get to a place where we talk more directly to Trish about the part of her that wants to connect with Paul and the part of her that really keeps him at arm's length so that he can stay independent and make her own decisions. 

01:23:25
PAUL Oh yeah, I don't know if there is better word but you're on the right track. 

01:23:30
PETER PEARSON All right, okay. 

01:23:30
TRISH Just draw it on paper with circles fills up there or not, yeah, and that part of. 

01:23:40
PETER PEARSON He's just kind of orbiting around. 

01:23:40
TRISH Right, not in that center core where he wants to be. 

01:23:45
PETER PEARSON Do you feel anything as we talk about these things Trish? 

01:23:50
TRISH I don't think I ever sat down and taking the time to think about it like, I am now and discussing it to see how umm… the effect it's gonna have on him and our relationship. And I think it's probably that wants us to connect me closer but it's just all these patterns and years of behavior and stuff that's making it harder. 

01:24:10
PETER PEARSON What's the motivation for the part that we like to be closer? Why would that part like to be closer with him? 

01:24:15
TRISH I think that's the basis of all the human connections to feel closer to someone to feel understood, to feel appreciated, valued to, you know, so I think long term when I think we talk about ourselves, you know, being long term partners umm… that's something you want to, I would like to you know, to cultivate and to, to grow and uh… 

01:24:40
PETER PEARSON When couples come in to the office, you share their struggle is on two major categories. One has to do with roles and responsibilities around the house. All the stuff that require for people to live together around you know chores and finances and parent came and the other area that couple struggle a little bit is the quality and the quantity of the emotional and sexual connection and those are the two most common arenas that couples struggle with when they come in. It sounds like you guys are getting better around roles and responsibility. Would that be accurate? 

01:25:15
TRISH I think, I need to ask for help and I'll allow him to help and not be judgmental about the help? 

01:25:20
PETER PEARSON Do you feel like anything when you say it? 

01:25:25
TRISH Actually, it's the truth, yeah, it's easier said than done now. 

01:25:30
PETER PEARSON Do you feel anxious when you say it? 

01:25:30
TRISH Anxious because it's yeah, it's hard to change if you've been in this way, you know. 

01:25:40
PETER PEARSON As you moved emotionally more connected and closer than Paul, it puts that a part of you at risk. That risk of being disappointed, that risk of depending on somebody, that risk of being let down. What else would it put you in risk for? 

01:25:55
TRISH I think those things that you said that depending on someone that you could lose that, get used to it and they're gone and something like that, you know, all those things. 

01:26:05
PETER PEARSON Yeah, Paul what are you thinking, your feeling as we talked about these things? 

01:26:10
PAUL I thought it was going pretty well. 

01:26:10
TRISH You're sitting on the sidelines here. 

01:26:15
ELLYN BADER I think Paul is glad that we are onto the amount of avoidance and how difficult it is for her to let him get close to her. 

01:26:25
PETER PEARSON What do you think Paul's initial attraction to you was about? 

01:26:30
TRISH What? You mean, initial when he first met me? 

01:26:35
PETER PEARSON Yeah, exactly, how were you guys were first together for those, for those, you know, those glorious days, weeks, months whatever. 

01:26:40
TRISH I thought, I think he thought I was interesting and fun and adventurous and I don't know. 

01:26:50
PAUL It was Match.com so we don't rise from those love and I don't remember the emails or whatever the introductory step but we get together pretty quickly, right. 

01:26:55
PETER PEARSON But after you get together, there is got to be something where you say, let's meet again and again after that. So that's what I'm curious about. What do you think, he's saying, yeah, let's do this again. 

01:27:05
TRISH The first time. 

01:27:10
PAUL Yeah, yeah, first time. 

01:27:10
TRISH Had to throw that in. Umm… he broke up with me. Devastating but I thought, he was the right one and umm… yeah, for how long? Six months, eight months, something like that but anyway, yeah, but before that umm… 

01:27:30
ELLYN BADER Don't rush by that so fast that what happened, you, you got together. 

01:27:35
TRISH We dated for what? A year, I don't know a while. 

01:27:35
ELLYN BADER And you were smitten? 

01:27:40
TRISH Yes. 

01:27:40
ELLYN BADER And then he broke up? 

01:27:40
TRISH Yes. 

01:27:40
ELLYN BADER And? 

01:27:40
TRISH And it was over. 

01:27:45
ELLYN BADER And you were heart broken? 

01:27:45
TRISH Yes. 

01:27:50
ELLYN BADER Well, here you are letting yourself depend on somebody again and what was the reason he gave you? 

01:27:55
TRISH I think, he just, he just wasn't sure and he didn't, you know, he didn't never say he loved me, so that was probably a big red flag. Umm… but then also just wasn't sure, it was right or I was the right person and wasn't fair to me and he needed to go, you know, date other people and I don't, that's kind of the gist of it, I don't remember. 

01:28:15
ELLYN BADER And then what happened for you? 

01:28:20
PAUL Well, it was actually pretty true. I was going to either cross a line and not, and not go back and umm… I wanted to make sure that, that was how I felt and what I wanted to do. So a few months later. 

01:28:40
TRISH More than a few months later. 

01:28:40
PAUL It wasn't that like six months? 

01:28:40
TRISH Yeah, probably six or eight months or something. 

01:28:45
PAUL But then I was pretty sure that this is what I wanted to and we talked and essentially, we had conversation which is that, yeah, you probably don't know, if you can trust me now, given that and I said, so, you know, I understand and agree and but I'm here because I want to be and, and I realize that, it's gonna take your time to understand that and, so you know I need to prove it to you and so and then we, we start seeing each other again. 

01:29:15
ELLYN BADER Within that time that you were apart, you were grieving a loss or you were? 

01:29:20
TRISH Yeah, I mean, I, I was because it felt, you know, I think as you get older in life and you date a lot of people, I mean there are, you know, it's hard to find someone that you feel connected with the right person and it was just devastating 

01:29:35
ELLYN BADER Devastating is painful and umm… during the time that you were apart, it seems like you were figuring it out, is she the right person or are there other people and you were kind of wanting to be sure, you were all the way in and you were letting go. Here is an important piece of their early history that's surfacing. After they've been together for not all that long, Paul decided to break up with her and she had been madly in love and was completely smitten and suddenly he's leaving. And then in the time that they were apart, they were actually doing two very emotionally different things. She was grieving, she was letting go. She was perceiving the relationship as finished and he, as he described, he went off trying to figure out is she the right person for me or not. So he's trying to make a decision, he's contemplating, he hasn't really let go of and he thought it was a shorter time than she did. She said, well it really was six or eight months. When they got back together again something that later on we are gonna find out more about is whether they dealt with that rupture in anyway that was satisfactory because for her that was her first disillusionment and if they didn't deal successfully with that rupture that also can contribute a great deal to her like this to him and not being sure she wants to really get close to him again. 

01:31:05
TRISH Oh, definitely, yeah, I mean that was shock when he called me. I had no expectations, I would ever hear from him again. 

01:31:15
A few minutes later we decided to introduce the Paper Exercise to Trish and Paul. 

01:31:20
PETER PEARSON We call this diagnostic intervention the paper exercise in which Ellyn is going to describe it. 

01:31:25
ELLYN BADER I would like to talk to you about the paper exercise. This is an exercise we often use diagnostically and here is what I'll say to a couple. I hold up an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper and I say to the couple, this piece of paper represents something important to you. I would like you to take a minute and think about what this piece of paper represents. You can pick anything that's important to you except for your kids and your marriage. And I want to be sure that I look somebody straight in the eye as I say, this piece of paper represents something important to you. So I pause and give them time to actually think about what it might represent to them. After that, I will then turn to the other person and I will say, this piece of paper represents something important to you and I'd like you to take a minute and decide what this piece of paper represents to you. And you can choose anything again except for your marriage and your kids. And I also want to pause and give that person time to really reflect and decide what it represents to them. After I've done that, I will then ask the couple to hold the piece of paper between them and I make sure that each partner has their hand on one end of the paper. And then I'll say to them, I'd like you to hold this piece of paper between you and I'm going to give you up to five minutes to decide who gets the paper without ripping or tearing it. You can do it verbally, you can do it non-verbally. You can do it anyway you chose but at the end of the five minutes, I'd like you to decide who gets the paper without ripping or tearing it. And if at that point, I'll be quiet. I'll usually even back up my chair a bit and I want to watch. I might even write down quickly what it is they say. Many couples will try to involve you by asking you lots of questions and when that happens, I say, you can do it verbally, you can to it non-verbally, you can do it anyway you want to but at the end of the five minutes, who has the paper without ripping or tearing it. I'd like to talk to you for a minute about what Peter and I are looking for when we give a couple this exercise. And there is really six main characteristics. The first is, do the partner's self-define? When I gave the directions, I really took time and looked at them each in the eye and I said, take a minute to think about what this represents to you. In that statement in the directions, I'm really asking the person to go internal and think about what the paper really means to them. And so when I'm watching, I want to see whether they each are able to define what the paper represents to them. Secondly, I'm interested in how they manage boundaries. Are their boundaries very rigid? Do they rigidly defend what it is they've selected or perhaps they're overly permeable and they give themselves up or give up very, very quickly what it is they wanted. I also want to know if they show an awareness that their partners actually separate and different from them and one of the ways, that you can tell that is whether they show an interest in their partner, whether they stop and ask questions and have some curiosity about what their partner selected and why they selected it. Fourth, we want to take a look at how they manage conflict. This exercise is actually purposely set up to be confliction. We tell them, each of them are going to pick something important and at the end of it only one partner gets to hold it. And so we want to see what is it that they do with the conflict. Do they avoid it, do they quickly mask it over or perhaps they escalate really, really quickly and get it into an even bigger, more intense fight. So we're looking very closely at how they manage the conflict. We also want to see if they have the capacity to move the conflict forward. Once they recognize that they are in conflict, are they able to negotiate? And last, we are looking at whether each partner has the capacity to give to the other or to receive from the other? And when the exercise is finished, usually the first thing I'll do is ask each partner what they're feeling about how it turned out, perhaps how characteristic is it of what they do at home and when I began to give feedback, I'm going to be giving feedback based on the place in this list of six that they first broke down. Where were their early break downs in terms of their own capacity to manage and get to a good solution in the five minutes and in fact some couples who don't solve it in five minutes are actually developmentally more advanced than those who try to solve it very quickly. Trish this piece of paper represents something important to you. Now, I would like you to take a minute and think about what it represents to you and it can be anything except for your kids and your marriage. Just think about what it represents to you and this piece of paper represents something important to you. And I would like you to take a minute and think about what it represents to you and then what I'm gonna ask you to do is hold the piece of paper between you for a minute and I'm gonna give you up to five minutes to decide who gets the paper. You can to it verbally, you can do it non-verbally, you can do it anyway you want to. But at the end of the five minutes, one of you has the paper without ripping or tearing it. We're gonna be quiet. 

01:37:45
PAUL All right. Well, my first question is, umm… do you think there is anything that we can't work out between each other? 

01:37:50
TRISH No. I want to know, what your, your, what did you decide. 

01:37:55
PAUL It doesn't matter. 

01:37:55
TRISH What is it? I mean, I'm curious, I wanna know. It doesn't matter? 

01:38:00
PAUL No, because if we can work things out, then. 

01:38:05
TRISH Forget about the paper. It matters to me to know what, what you said. 

01:38:10
PAUL Well, I'll tell you that later but we're about to tear the paper, it doesn't matter. Because if, if we can work stuff out then, umm… whatever umm… is important and I feel the same way, so what is important to you I'll help make it happen and… 

01:38:30
TRISH So if one of us gets the paper then what the other person doesn't, is what you're saying? 

01:38:30
PAUL Well, that's kind of why I said this is a fair question because I was gonna change rules and I'm gonna say that because I get what I want, it doesn't mean that you get what you want just because you get what you want, it doesn't mean I get what I want. 

01:38:45
TRISH I agree with that, so. 

01:38:45
PAUL All right, so you can have the paper. 

01:38:45
TRISH You can have it. Umm… yeah I mean, this is how this is uh… just a piece of paper. 

01:38:55
PAUL So one of us has to have the paper so I'll pass it to you, you have it and then… 

01:38:55
TRISH Okay. 

01:38:55
TRISH …put the stuff out later. 

01:38:55
TRISH Then you're gonna tell me what's your shoice. What was it? What was it? 

01:39:05
PAUL Uh… play the guitar. 

01:39:05
TRISH Oh, I'm glad I have it. But no, I'll just let you play the guitar. It means a lot to you. 

01:39:15
PAUL Thank you. 

01:39:20
TRISH Interesting exercise. 

01:39:20
ELLYN BADER How are you feeling? 

01:39:25
TRISH Well, I'm here, he did ask me what mine was but I guess we have to fill this, I mean. 

01:39:30
PAUL Well, because for the paper exercise. 

01:39:35
TRISH Okay. 

01:39:35
ELLYN BADER What's your first emotional response to it. 

01:39:40
TRISH I think the big emotional response is that he didn't care what mine was. 

01:39:45
ELLYN BADER And now you're feeling that was what? 

01:39:45
TRISH That he doesn't, yeah, it just makes me sad, it makes me feel like he doesn't really and that was the first thing, I wanted to know, I didn't care about the piece of paper. 

01:39:55
ELLYN BADER Two things here. One is, as they finished, I wanted to know if they were really finished. Because so often couples aren't emotionally finished, they're not really settled with the way it's come out but they don't know how to activate themselves and that's particularly true with couples who are symbiotic, conflicted avoidant couples like Trish and Paul. They really don't have the capacity to say, wait a minute, it's not done all right like to see us do something else. And so then I followed that up with what do you feel as it comes to a conclusion. So I want to see if they can articulate that feeling of being unsettled. 

01:40:40
PETER PEARSON It's an interesting statement that Trish made when she said, I got it but it didn't feel like he really cared that much about what it meant for me or what it was. Which is very interesting because often a person in Paul's shoes will think they're doing their partner a favor by just accusing and giving them what they want. How it's felt on the other side is, do you care enough about me to really ask what do I want? Why is it important if I get what I want? What does that symbolize to me, uh… if I don't get it, what does that symbolize to me, what does it mean to me. So by asking more questions, you actually have paradoxically the other person feeling like they're really being heard and responded to. 

01:41:30
TRISH That's a big deal, you know, other than your kids and your part of its like the biggest deal in your life. 

01:41:40
ELLYN BADER So you're holding the paper and feeling sad holding the paper. What are you feeling? 

01:41:45
PAUL Well, before her answer, I felt great because, to me it's an affirmation of our relationship and that we'll work things out and you know, I trust her to do that. 

01:41:55
ELLYN BADER So you're going good as an affirmation strength and. 

01:42:00
PAUL Not an affirmation of us. Strength in the relationship, not strength of me or anything. 

01:42:05
TRISH I think, it's very typical but I either he expresses or I want to find out what he wants. So I'm not even dealing with what I want, I'm dealing with five other things. That feels like very calming to me. Umm…, so I don't even know what I want. So I'm trying to appease everyone else. 

01:42:25
ELLYN BADER Yeah, so you're so externally cued in and trying to pay attention to what does he want, what do my kids want umm… that you don't ask yourself. 

01:42:30
TRISH I cant please everyone and it's often very frustrating. 

01:42:35
ELLYN BADER And it would have meant in this case, it would have meant a lot to you, what Paul said, hey what is that you really want Trish? Because that's hard for you to get there. 

01:42:45
PAUL It doesn't feel fair to me though because umm… uh…the in this case, umm… you know, I, it was my action not to ask in the, in the real world I do ask in fact, I kind of try to insist and point her to, what do you want. Well forget about them, forget about me, what do you want? 

01:43:05
ELLYN BADER It's hard for you to know yourself really well when you're caught up with a lot of other people. Umm… and that showed up in this exercise right now umm… because how hard it would have been for you to not let it finish, to say to Paul well, wait a minute, I really do want you to ask me right now, I do care for you to ask me what the paper meant to me. 

01:43:35
TRISH I know it would have been hard to me as far 

01:43:35
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:43:40
ELLYN BADER So you would, you would really like him to ask you? 

01:43:45
TRISH Umm…, you know, I would have liked him to ask me a couple of minutes ago I think. Now that we've done all these things, it's like okay, but it's, I think that we just had a different, you know… 

01:43:55
PAUL A different way of thinking about. 

01:43:55
TRISH Different way of thinking about at the time. 

01:44:00
ELLYN BADER And it's not, it's not a problem to have a different way of thinking about but I think one of the things that's showing up is a challenge for you and that challenge is can I really get in touch with myself? Can I represent who I am in the face of kids needs or Paul's needs or family needs? Can I, first of all can I take the time to even internally figure it out and to really pay attention and then if you do pay attention to say it, to hold onto it, to keep it present, active part of the conversation umm… and not the kind of disappear a little bit up. 

01:44:45
TRISH That's true and I actually I'm thinking a lot of conversations, I feel like they are more focused on Paul's needs and issues and things. 

01:45:00
ELLYN BADER So what I was talking about with Trish is actually how her lower level of differentiation was surfacing, the fact that it's very hard for her to take the time to internally self-reflect, to know what matters to her, to pay attention to what matters to her and to be able to bring that forward and she's so focused on uh… kid's need, kid's need especially that umm… she puts herself last and doesn't strengthen her own capacity to come forward. 

01:45:35
TRISH Because maybe mine aren't so strong or so clear. 

01:45:40
ELLYN BADER But you don't let them get to the point of strength and clarity. Umm…would you do an experiment for a minute and just see what it feels like? 

01:45:50
TRISH Sure. 

01:45:50
ELLYN BADER Would you say to Paul, you know, Paul, one of the ways, I really like to depend on you and one thing, you do for me that really matters a lot is when you do try to figure out what I care about when you do want to know what the paper represents to me, when you, when you really put in that energy to notice me, that means a lot. 

01:46:15
TRISH Okay. Paul. 

01:46:20
ELLYN BADER At this point, I'm asking Trish to turn to Paul and to express to him directly so that she can feel more of the emotional impact of it, to express to him directly umm… more about the difficulty that she has and her desire that he recognize that she in fact is separate and different from him and illicit some of her thoughts and feelings by shoring an interest in her. 

01:46:45
PETER PEARSON Which is really interesting because Paul's intention, idea, philosophy was, if I just give in and don't push her that is an act of love and trust which has just the opposite effect of growing their relationship. 

01:47:05
TRISH …my umm…, I think it really matters to me umm… for you, let's see, umm… it's harder to do. Umm… but I think the crux is that, that umm… it matters to me that you care about what I'm thinking and wanting umm… which is that was clear to me but it matters that you want to know that. 

01:47:40
ELLYN BADER What does it feel to, for you to even say that to him? 

01:47:45
TRISH It felt weird and awkward. Just didn't come up at the top of my head. 

01:47:45
ELLYN BADER Okay. 

01:47:50
TRISH At all and I have to umm… because I don't do it very often. 

01:47:50
ELLYN BADER Right, right. 

01:47:50
TRISH I don't know, how to do it. 

01:47:55
ELLYN BADER So actually, you just put it in your own words. Say, say to Paul you know, Paul, I don't do this very often, I don't know, how to do this very well. Uh… start there. 

01:48:05
TRISH I, I think it's in the beginning This is hard, because, I don't even know how to, how to do it but I think because I don't umm… ask for these kinds of things very often not even clear how to do it but I really like it umm… and I'd appreciate it when you want to know what I'm thinking and feeling and ask me and trying to kind of get, all the superficial to see what's really important to me. 

01:48:30
ELLYN BADER Will you just tell him what the paper did represent to you? 

01:48:35
TRISH Oh, do you want to know? 

01:48:35
PAUL I would love to know. 

01:48:40
TRISH It umm… it was just umm… making a difference. 

01:48:45
PAUL Oh. You can have that. That's more important to me. 

01:48:50
[sil.] 

01:48:55
PAUL And so, I'd like to say umm… thank you for telling me that you actually want me to be a pain to. 

01:49:05
TRISH Sometimes. 

01:49:10
PAUL To make in this one way, to make you, to get under, you know whatever is going on to get your real umm…, what you really want and what you really and I'm happy to do that. 

01:49:25
TRISH Thank you. Sometimes, I'm not even clear what I want. It takes me a while to figure it out. 

01:49:25
PAUL Yeah. 

01:49:30
ELLYN BADER What are you feeling Trish? 

01:49:30
TRISH I'm feeling heard and validated and umm… clearer on my, my issues, I think. 

01:49:40
[sil.] 

01:49:45
ELLYN BADER So many times when couples get together, we move too fast. We think, we know, we move quickly or you have different agendas. That's life that happens many, many times over and especially when you're managing kids and, you know, all of that. You're on the role of, do you think, there is anything we can't work out and you were focused on the process and being confident in your process and Trish was focused on really wanting to know what you wanted and also wanting to share what she wanted. So you were on a different wavelength which could happen easily. It takes being able to really listen to yourself first of all so that you don't let it drop at the end but you say to Paul, wait, I did want to tell you and it really does matter to me and you are moving too fast for me there because I don't want this to be over yet. Umm… and when we meet next time and we talk about family issues or the lending issues and things that are hard for you guys, part of what we are gonna do is really talk about how you slow down and have only one person decide at a time. So that you really do feel listen to you, you do feel heard, you do know what's like you said underneath, you know, what's driving it because much better solutions then come when you truly take the time umm… and only do one person side at a time. So that you know what matters deeply to each other and too often couples just move way, way, way too fast and give themselves up quickly but it comes back later in ways that perhaps result in you saying, okay, I'll just be independent. And the part of you is comfortable there. But another part did chose Paul and does want to be with him and you say, do you want to know what mattered, what more you really go after the learning about her in this way, that really matters. That probably matters more to her than holding hands even though she likes the holding hands because nobody has taken the time or shown much interest and she said, years of raising kids where she has put all her attention and focus on them and to have you genuinely deeply interested in her is very, very meaningful. 

01:52:20
PETER PEARSON What do you feel as you hear Ellyn describe what she is saying? 

01:52:25
TRISH It's pretty right on, ten out of ten. 

01:52:30
PETER PEARSON And the emotion is what? 

01:52:30
TRISH Umm… uh… I've mixed emotions, I think. I'm kind of validated a little bit and heard and understood and clarity, a lot of different feelings, social feelings actually that umm… yeah I think the biggest has been validated and heard. 

01:53:00
ELLYN BADER You look a little teary-eyed. 

01:53:05
TRISH Yeah, because it's pretty, it's pretty big. I mean kind of hearing it really umm… having gotten there between us before, it's kind of… 

01:53:15
ELLYN BADER So here as we approach the end of the session, a number of things were going on. I was really wrapping up and summarizing so much of what we had done for the first session and paving the way for the second session, let them know how we would begin to move things forward. But especially here toward the end, really accentuating the importance of them slowing down and of her taking the time to let him know what matter so much to her and she's now beginning to let her, she's getting teary-eyed. She's recognizing that this is important to her and she wants to be more known by him and she wants him to take an interest in her. 

01:54:05
TRISH … new insight that feel very true and profound in me. 

01:54:10
PETER PEARSON And Paul what do you think and feel as you were listening to what Ellyn was saying? 

01:54:20
PAUL Well, I feel more connected in the process. Connected to Trish because umm… uh… I, I don't think she wants anybody know what she really want and so the fact that she wants me to know that is a big deal. 

01:54:40
ELLYN BADER And you tell her, tell her, tell her. 

01:54:45
PAUL I think that umm… this is, I appreciate how hard this has been for you and I think that you umm… uh… don't let others know what you really want and think and you do so much for other people umm… and I think the fact that you're willing, that you're not only willing to ultimately share but you want me to help you share with me the, the things that you really want need. You know, you're a real person's feelings and thoughts. Umm…, you know, I don't think there is any closer to get in that. So. 

01:55:20
TRISH Thank you. 

01:55:25
PETER PEARSON And you're feeling what Trish? 

01:55:30
TRISH Very heard, validated, cared for, loved, yeah, yeah.

ELLYN BADER Hello, I'm Ellyn Bader and this is my husband Peter Pearson. Thanks for joining us for the second session with Trish and Paul. As this session gets started what we want to do is check back on what happened in the first session. We want to find out the reactions to the paper exercise. We want to know a little bit about what's happened during the week umm… and how they responded to the questions that Pete was asking and so we begin by asking them for that kind of feedback. 

01:56:20
Trish & Paul 

01:56:20
Session # 2 

01:56:25
ELLYN BADER We'd love to hear what stood out each of you from last time? So that might get right into what you were. 

01:56:30
PETER PEARSON And then headlines of when we met last time to today. So just some quick headlines of the state of the union. 

01:56:40
TRISH Well, so I think, you know, we're waiting to together to write our comments which we all had, we was, a part umm…for during mixing the keys and time and I think we both follows are very effective in getting to umm… the heart of the matter, quickly without you knowing us. It seem like, umm… the way you ask questions and, and the way umm… uh… discussions went, we dealt with things and got each to validate each other's feelings about where we were at and rating, that rating system was very helpful. I thought and I'd never done it before to say, yes, we were, we realized we were pretty much right on a lot of things but also, umm… you know, the things that you picked up on and then delved into different areas, I think that the yellow paper was a very interesting exercise so… 

01:57:25
PETER PEARSON Yes it was. 

01:57:30
TRISH Forget about the paper. It matters to me to know what, what you said. 

01:57:35
PAUL I'll tell you that later but we're about to tear the paper, it doesn't matter. 

01:57:40
TRISH I don't know, if you want to add, add things for 

01:57:40
PAUL Umm… you know it kind of thing, because I was, a process a little bit to say that the, the exercises or the questions were very good, constructive for us as well as uh… informative, you know, revealing and then informative to you guys so you can actually then, you know, be more empowered to help us and stuff so that's, I thought that technique was great and it was, you know, helpful to us, you know look at things in new ways. 

01:58:05
TRISH You know, I guess I would love to ask Paul how he felt with, you know, this wedding was a family wedding and all my extended family some of which, you've never met and including him in that, even though he wasn't there for the whole time. He was there for the three or four day wedding events. How you felt and if you felt included or not? 

01:58:25
PAUL Yes. We just uh… a little background they flew, meeting Trish's, Christopher and Courtney, the two kids and then Trish's sister and her nephew, yeah. 

01:58:35
TRISH We were both single moms and raised our kids together. So we were quite, vacations and everything was together. Our parents died when my son was born, so I think you know, the five of us did a lot together you know, when Paul came in the picture was always kind of hard to put it and I just me and my kids but even my sister and her son and the comfort of doing vacation together, this, we'd all like to sleep all in the same room or the same tent or whatever. 

01:58:55
PAUL And so then, it's like well, where would I sleep? 

01:59:00
TRISH It's like, you know separate tents and my kids were like, no that's just don't work, we want you in my tent, you know, and it just change things, you know, so it's been hard process for us both, I think to go through. 

01:59:10
ELLYN BADER Let me ask you each to think about, you know, what would you most like us to focus on today, like if you really walked out of here and said, I'm so glad, we focused on that? 

01:59:25
TRISH I still think that umm… you know, the yellow paper was pretty profound. It feels like that there is something more to explore there, maybe. 

01:59:30
ELLYN BADER Something more to pay attention to from the paper exercise. 

01:59:35
TRISH Right, yeah. But I also think that this other issue constantly comes out. 

01:59:40
PAUL This issue that we are talking about has been you know, probably the most difficult one for us. 

01:59:45
PETER PEARSON The issue of inclusion? 

01:59:45
TRISH I think that's the biggest issue. Maybe it's not the whole. 

01:59:50
PAUL Well, it, it maybe related to the paper exercise because somewhere in the discussion we got to Trish's willingness to take a risk or extend herself in the relationship. If I, am I correct you saw yesterday? And umm… that the inclusion thing to me, it has been part of that which is how big umm…, you know, how to extend an invitation to me without putting yourself at risk or umm… uh… you know, what are your feelings versus the feelings of those around you and how do you weigh those things and so that, that came up last time but I'm not sure so… 

02:00:40
ELLYN BADER Well let me, maybe a good thing would be if, if I summarize a few things that I saw in the paper exercise. 

02:00:45
PAUL Okay. 

02:00:50
ELLYN BADER Umm… and then umm… we can still navigate our way to what we are gonna do today. 

02:00:50
PAUL Okay. 

02:00:55
ELLYN BADER Umm… but one of the reasons that we usually give that exercise is that it's very revealing with partners in terms of seeing a couple of things. One of those is umm… does each person really say what mattered to them or say what was important, what, what you selected that was important to you umm… and then usually that raises some conflict because, I mean, there is some purposeful conflict built into that exercise because you're not gonna pick the same thing and that's life often two people want different things at the same time. Then we look at how do you take the desire that you have for two different things and figure out what's important to you and how do you explore what's important to Paul and how does Paul explore what's important to you umm… deeply enough that then you can realize what it is you're solving because so often, I think I said this in that session actually, sometimes couples go way too fast and they're solving a problem before they really know what's underneath or what it is they're solving and so umm… one of the things that I saw happen when you guys seated last time is Paul, you were right in there ready to negotiate like, let's, let's negotiate a solution really quickly and you were saying, but wait, you know, umm… I want, I want to know what you picked and you also wanted Paul to show more interest in you and in fact that's where you got teary-eyed was wanting Paul to be able to explore your reality more before needing to get to a solution. 

02:02:40
TRISH I reacted to him not you know, asking what it was for me umm… that was my biggest, I think reaction. 

02:02:50
ELLYN BADER Yeah, you did react, you wanted Paul to ask more about why it was important to you. I mean, what it was first of all, yeah. Yeah, yeah exactly. 

02:03:00
TRISH The next steps but. 

02:03:00
ELLYN BADER And you talked a lot about having been a single parent and being on your own and having Paul's interest, having Paul real true interest in you is something that you missed a lot for many years as you've been a single parent and so that in fact was very meaningful to you to have him care and have him want to know, want to know you more deeply. 

02:03:25
TRISH And I think his response felt like he cared. I mean, it felt very caring way to way he was willing to give me what I wanted and not even ask and, and just, you know, and that felt very touching in some ways, that he was going to do it but we didn't even talk about what it was or what, you know so that was kind of interesting to me. I mean, there's a part of me feels like you know, you generally care more and whatever but then there was that deeper part that almost feels like, yeah. 

02:03:55
ELLYN BADER Oh, that, that feels what, there is a deeper part that feels what? 

02:04:00
TRISH That it's almost superficial or not really. I don't think superficial, it's not true, I don't know how to describe it but feeling was that, it just because you care about me, you want to be nice and you just want to give it to me but not really know what it's all about. 

02:04:15
PETER PEARSON So, it's almost like, you don't want Paul to surrender himself most of the time just to respond to you. It's like you, you want something back from him as well. Uh… 

02:04:30
TRISH Yeah. 

02:04:30
ELLYN BADER Being the independent single mom who did everything on your own for so long umm… has its strength and things that you've really taken from that umm… and it also has its loneliness side and that when Paul explored more deeply with you that, that is something you want but you're also little afraid of, that it's both, you want that deeper level of intimacy of knowing each other even more and am I making it? 

02:05:05
TRISH Yeah, and I think it's hard for me because, I haven't really been or had that at that level and then I think it's also little scary because you know, you could lose it again, you know. I'm saying that just intellectually, I don't, I mean, I'm sure I feel that but. 

02:05:20
ELLYN BADER You're, did you say, you're sure you feel or you're not sure? 

02:05:20
TRISH My guess is that's what, you know, he's behind it, why it's hard for me because, I know it's hard for me, you know, umm… but, but then I don't know how much is that it's that the kind of person I am you know, I've always been that way, so it's hard for me to let those, you know, thinks down and be more vulnerable or umm… just because, I've never done it very much because I've been on my own pretty much or because I'm also afraid of what that means, I don't know, afraid of losing anything. 

02:05:55
ELLYN BADER And it's probably some of all of that. 

02:05:55
TRISH Yeah. 

02:06:00
ELLYN BADER Probably, so I mean and in fact we talk at the end the last time about umm… Paul having broken up with you for a while too and so, and at a period where umm… you were trying to figure out was she right, was this what you wanted and you had really decided he was the guy for you and then that was hard during that period of time and so now you've reinvested again and there is that part that wants more connection. 

02:06:35
TRISH I felt a lot, you know, wanting to spend time with them, doing things with him. We want to often do things just with me not with all of us. Him wanting to, you know, spending you know, all those umm… and then you know, there is everything else in life, work and friends and family and you know, and I think that's one of my issues that I don't ask for what I want enough or don't stick to it, you know, in that, now I just got a flashback that my daughter is leaving in two weeks, I remember, early on that you're saying, this is your last year, one night a week, I want to have with her and not do anything and now the year is over and I really haven't done that. No, but I didn't, we talked about it and we write it, enforcing, okay, this is our night, you know, you go do something I will, so, you know, it made me just kind of, I don't know fast for me now… 

02:07:20
ELLYN BADER That's the paper exercise, right. 

02:07:25
TRISH I, I didn't ask for what I wanted, you know, I didn't, it's just on a… 

02:07:25
PAUL Oh, you did. I'd say, yeah, no problem. Well, it was, was I supposed to do some what? 

02:07:30
PETER PEARSON A part of you caved, you know. A part of you. 

02:07:35
PAUL Gave to me? 

02:07:40
TRISH Yeah, didn't say, I need my and I was going to make it every one has denied or whatever yeah, I didn't, didn't force it or I didn't want to enforce it, but I pursue it or demanded even I mean, surely that's a strong word for me but I didn't yeah, or didn't take initiatives just make it happen. 

02:07:55
ELLYN BADER Right, it's all of those. 

02:07:55
TRISH All those things in it. 

02:07:55
ELLYN BADER In the paper exercise, before we finished, you said to Paul umm…, something that was like, you know, don't you want to know what I picked and he said I'm fine, I know we can negotiate it. 

02:08:10
TRISH It doesn't matter. 

02:08:10
ELLYN BADER And so and then you let it finish. You know, you didn't say wait, it matters to me that you ask me. 

02:08:20
TRISH Yeah, I didn't do that, right, I just let it go, accepted it so I do a lot. 

02:08:25
ELLYN BADER Yeah. 

02:08:25
PETER PEARSON And that, that was my point that there is a part of you have this conflict. The good news is, a part of you can identify what you want or what's important. Good, good, good news. The downside is there is another part of you that will cave in too quickly uh… and give it up. 

02:08:45
TRISH That big part of me. 

02:08:45
PETER PEARSON Yeah and not and that phenomena with you, I think is also a problem for Paul because he wants the clarity from you the changing clarity, the evolving clarity. He wants the clarity. Tell me what it is Trish that you really want now and or later and don't give up on it. 

02:09:10
PAUL So just to be clear, I don't want you to give in on anything and if it's important to you, it should be important to you and you know, we can then you know, weigh the importance to each other and figure out some solution right and talk about it but umm… 

02:09:25
ELLYN BADER Does that mean that you can tolerate some tension for a little while, while you figure it out? 

02:09:30
PAUL Yeah, right in the process of figuring out, the tension of not really doing whether or not saying, what you want or whatever, that's the, that's the unsettling part right. 

02:09:40
PETER PEARSON On a scale of 1 to 10, how unsettling is that phenomena for you? Not knowing. Not knowing Trish, her priorities etc. 

02:09:50
PAUL Umm…, it's not that not knowing as much as it's the umm… you know, so I grew up in a family with two alcoholic parents, lots of you know, uh… umm… unsaid tension, unspoken tension and so, you know, I was I grew up sensing at, what it was going on and figuring out how to survive in this day, in this moment and umm… you know, and at some point, I learned to get kind of beyond that and you know, and let people be people and as much as possible but you know, I'm in a still some theft there. So umm… I don't appreciate that right, you know, because it's like, well, we should just talk about what it is and you know when… 

02:10:35
ELLYN BADER Get it out in the open. 

02:10:35
PAUL Yeah and, you know be real about it, right and so umm… so at sometimes the tension has been very high a 10 or 11. 

02:10:45
PETER PEARSON The unspoken things can create some high tension at times. 

02:10:50
PAUL Yeah. Right, right and it's kind of that lack of trust or the lack of, of understanding of intimacy, right umm… and there was one time a couple of years ago or something where umm… they uh… Trish was having problem with some computer thing and she there is, I said out loud well, what's my password and so, you know, for something and then, you know so the kids are like, alright, Christopher had to like write the password and goes this side, you know, and stuff and so we've talked about passwords and you know so, I knew what the password was but it was like, you know, you know, we, at this point we've been together years, you know, and you know whatever the dynamic and tension and thing about them versus what I would do with the password, you know, after all these years, it's kind of like, you know, what, what is this, right so and I actually got upset, I got to go for a walk and I left for a couple of hours, you know and just went off into the hills walking and you know, came back, you know, much, much later and then told her what that thing was, like because I just, it was like, this is, this is too much for me, right now, so. 

02:12:05
TRISH And I guess, I thought, I couldn't blame my kids, they didn't know anything or, you know, I don't know. 

02:12:10
PAUL Well, I don't really blame them either but just, you know, that situation which is, you know, of, you know, not accepting us to a degree is what it means to me that they don't accept us, it's that, you know, that it's still, it's still well, there is mom and there is Paul as opposed to there is them. 

02:12:35
Initiator Inquirer 

02:12:35
ELLYN BADER Pete and I have a way that we teach couples often how to talk about issues in a way that really locates what belongs to each person and so that there is a lot of attention on one side at a time and not kind of they going back and forth and I think it might be really valuable to try that for a few minutes, in here, if that's okay with you. Here is basically the way we think about it, which is that you know, when kids are in kindergarten they learn about taking turns. But once we grow up, we forget about the idea of taking turns and so we teach a process called the initiator Inquirer basically where one of you is the person who has the issue whatever or feelings, you say it. I'm feeling X or Y about this particular topic and I would like to talk to you about it and so the initiator is the person who has got the issue, who brings up the topic, who says what they feel about it and who when it goes really well, actually learns more about themselves, when they're done talking about it then they knew when they started. For example, if you were the initiator, that would mean Paul asking you more deeply about yourself in a way that you're suggesting you would like it last time. That's the initiators role. The inquirer's role is first to listen to be sure, you understand what you're being told, then to ask questions and those questions are designed to really go deeper, so you would be asking Paul for example, if he was initiating about feeling excluded. You would really be asking him more about his feelings of exclusion. If she was talking about her feelings of being pulled in so many different directions, you would be asking her more deeply, you know, about that feeling of being pulled in so many directions. But then what makes the inquirer role different is really asking enough until you can really get out of yourself and empathize with the other person's experience. So it's truly an expression of empathy. So for you, it might be about what Paul has felt trying to feel more included in the family or for you it might be feeling and getting more deeply how much she struggles with feeling so pulled that she doesn't tell you directly what she really wants. And you really stay with that empathy until you get to a soothing moment, you get to that moment of deeper connection when you say, ‘hey, he really heard me, he really got me' and you know, you both learn something more about each other when you're done. So does that sound like? 

02:15:20
TRISH Yeah. 

02:15:20
PAUL Yeah. 

02:15:20
PETER PEARSON A worthwhile endeavor. 

02:15:20
TRISH Yes definitely. 

02:15:25
ELLYN BADER And I'll even do this. I'll give you a well, first of all, how about if you guys decide who is gonna initiate and who's gonna inquire? 

02:15:35
TRISH Okay, which, which is which position? 

02:15:35
PAUL Initiate means that like you, you talk about umm…. 

02:15:35
TRISH Oh, initiative discussion. 

02:15:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, you initiate the discussion, the topic. 

02:15:40
TRISH And then the inquirer asks. 

02:15:40
PAUL Yeah, to probe some more deeply understand. Umm… you can initiate, if you'd like to talk about the… 

02:15:45
TRISH No, you can initiate. 

02:15:50
Many partners want the other to go first in exposing vulnerability. 

02:15:55
PAUL Okay, I'm happy to do it. 

02:15:55
TRISH Okay. This one would help me. 

02:16:00
ELLYN BADER All right. So Paul's gonna initiate? 

02:16:00
TRISH Yes. 

02:16:00
ELLYN BADER Okay. So we'll let you take a look at that side. 

02:16:00
PAUL Okay. 

02:16:05
ELLYN BADER That's designed so it can actually stand on a table between you both. You can… 

02:16:10
TRISH I'm the inquirer. 

02:16:10
ELLYN BADER Yes. So as you're thinking Paul, think focus on one issue like if you can pull it down to one. 

02:16:20
PAUL Yeah, umm… so umm… as I, as I tried to think about it, you know, about this issue what umm… uh… it kind of goes back to when I, when we talked about the wedding and things that happened at the wedding and I support, yeah, you know, I mean, a kind of accept a lot of these and umm… you know, it's just the way it is and there is not that much to do about it so. 

02:16:50
ELLYN BADER But does it still matter enough that you would want Trish to understand it better and understand you better in that regard? 

02:16:55
PAUL Umm… well, you know when we asked what, you know, what we, in that umm… when the first exercise about what do you think the other person thinks or feels and I think she knows this umm… 

02:17:10
PETER PEARSON Is this the initiating topic? 

02:17:15
ELLYN BADER She's trying to decide it actually. 

02:17:15
PAUL On one that I want to initiate in truth because umm… the thing that makes, made this harder for me was your lack of clarity on what you wanted and you know, communicating that. 

02:17:30
TRISH That's my thing, but I think we are focusing on your thing. It was an issue for you right. Because, because just like the umm… the password thing, I mean the thing with the computer just a few weeks ago and that was pretty hard. 

02:17:45
PAUL The computer a few weeks ago? 

02:17:50
TRISH Yeah with Courtney's gift you know, and how you felt about that. I think it's the same feeling like you're being left out or excluded. I mean, so it's still is coming up not for any blame or reason but with situations. Oh, I remember that one. 

02:18:05
ELLYN BADER So you're inviting Paul to talk to you about it. 

02:18:10
TRISH Yeah, that is not totally. 

02:18:10
ELLYN BADER And Paul, I think it's good that you're like saying, okay, let me get focused here, let me think out… 

02:18:15
PAUL Yeah. 

02:18:15
ELLYN BADER …something that does matter to me. 

02:18:20
PAUL Umm… umm… okay, it's, it's a little hard for me because the question is what time, so, and those things about what day it is right? So…. 

02:18:35
ELLYN BADER And truly, if you don't want to initiate, you can ask Trish if she would. I mean, you don't have, if there is nothing that's you're tapping into that you have some emotion about it, you care about it. 

02:18:45
TRISH Well, I do, I do care, I mean I have cared a lot about this and I do care about it. You know, I just try to get myself into you know, a happy existence place where they're right, you know, maybe not the happiest place whole time but you know, I mean there is a lot more in life to worry about, right. 

02:19:05
ELLYN BADER So you trying to get to a place of acceptance and… 

02:19:05
PAUL Yeah, right. 

02:19:05
ELLYN BADER …but it still matters. 

02:19:10
PAUL Umm… uh… 

02:19:10
PETER PEARSON A part of you still has some charge on it when you think about it. 

02:19:15
PAUL Yeah, and I can, I can find that charge. So it was, so. 

02:19:20
PETER PEARSON Okay. It's, as an initiator, it's good to talk about something that a part of that still has a charge about. 

02:19:25
PAUL Right, right. Okay, so I'll try to do it from the self-discovery perspective. 

02:19:30
[sil.] 

02:19:45
ELLYN BADER Okay, are you ready? 

02:19:45
PAUL Yeah. 

02:19:45
ELLYN BADER Okay, so can you guys just look at each other? 

02:19:50
PAUL All right, this is umm…, it's kind of weird because this is, it gets raised an issue and it comes up as an issue between us but it's really an expression of who I am and who I, you know, and how I want to live and who and how I express myself and each of our lives are filled with multiple relationships but ultimately for me, umm… I've chosen you to be umm… my most important relationship and even though I've got other really important relationships in my life, it certainly doesn't make them unimportant but my choice is that, I choose you to be the relationship that matters the most to me to be sustained the most to, you know, on a daily coming and going basis umm… uh…, you know, for it to be us and umm… I don't just do that uh… in the past, I do that today. Umm… so with that in mind, umm… what happens a lot is that when you… turn away from me or, or exclude me in certain ways or don't think of, of me as a, as a umm… as you know, your primary relationship then umm… you know, I feel lost. 

02:21:25
[sil.] 

02:21:30
ELLYN BADER Take your time. 

02:21:35
TRISH It's huge. 

02:21:40
PAUL So umm… so when all these things when there is reminders about us not being us, they, uh…, you know, they just remind me that we are not us and that other people, you know, don't think of us as us. And that makes me feel less like us. 

02:22:05
ELLYN BADER And can you, you feel hurt or sad or tell her, can you tell her what those more, a little more about… 

02:22:15
PAUL Well, yeah, I mean, I feel umm… you know, I guess mostly then umm… I feel alone. Which is you know, not a safe and happy place kind of just like going through a little uh… 

02:22:35
[sil.] 

02:22:40
TRISH I'm not sure, if I'm supposed to talk. 

02:22:40
ELLYN BADER Can you ask him a little… 

02:22:45
PETER PEARSON Before you ask him, what will you tell Paul, what stands out for you as you listen to him and describe this process? 

02:22:55
ELLYN BADER And what you're hearing. 

02:22:55
PETER PEARSON what kind of experience is it for you? Yeah, what are you hearing that really stands out for you? 

02:23:00
[sil.] 

02:23:05
TRISH Umm… a couple of things. One is how important I am to you, I mean, to him. Umm… it's you know, kind of mind-boggling. Umm… but how umm…, how hard and how alone and you didn't use the word sad but that makes me sad when I hear how you describe me, how you feel. When these things happened umm… and how it umm… makes us feel disconnected in that we are not us anymore and even though I think a lot of these things are beyond us, the fact that it makes you feel umm… so alone is, is really umm… it makes me feel very different about a lot of these things I mean, more when I often get offensive or makes excuses or explain the kids or explain me, what really I'm hearing is how you feel on that really umm…, it's just pretty profound how, how deep this feeling is for you and how, what is it and how, you know, I don't want you to ever feel that way, you know, it makes me sad that you do feel that way. And then obviously things that either I do or my kids do that makes you feel alone in the world and left out. 

02:24:35
[sil.] 

02:24:40
PAUL I think that's, yeah. 

02:24:45
ELLYN BADER So, she heard you pretty well? 

02:24:50
PAUL Yeah, umm… yeah. 

02:24:55
ELLYN BADER I mean, if there is more, I want her to be able to ask you some more but if there is more that you want to be sure to say to her. 

02:25:05
PAUL You know, I think, that, the people give signals. The hard part for me is that umm… the way I interpret it and I've done all these right or the best way or whatever is that, then people umm… are interpreting the signals they get from you umm… which is part of your expression about how you feel about me which makes me feel that your commitment to me isn't a 100% and umm… and then uh… that makes me unsure about ultimately what we are. 

02:25:50
TRISH And it also sounds like you feel alone and not connected. 

02:25:55
PAUL Yeah, I mean it makes, yeah. 

02:25:55
TRISH It kind of feels sad on my end. 

02:26:00
PAUL Yeah, I mean but, but I don't use sour words so much, okay, so I cannot… 

02:26:10
ELLYN BADER When Trish, when he started, he talked a little bit about feeling lost in those moments of disconnection. Can you just ask him to tell you a little bit more about his feeling lost? 

02:26:25
TRISH You know, how did that feel, how did that feel lost? 

02:26:30
PAUL Well, you know, well, then it just feels like I'm in a, umm… uh… you know, I'm just in a spot as the world is spinning and I could be any where else and it wouldn't make a difference. 

02:26:50
TRISH Alone? 

02:26:50
PAUL Alone, put me any place in the world and I'd just be in the same state, so, put me and I'll be here. 

02:27:00
TRISH Very alone. Not connected to anyone. 

02:27:00
PAUL Yeah and I can just go and sure I can talk to people and you know and, you know. 

02:27:10
TRISH No, no one cares about you. 

02:27:10
PAUL Yeah and what's it gonna be ultimately, right so. 

02:27:15
TRISH Alone in the world. 

02:27:15
PAUL Right, what's the deepest connection and what's the real connection and why we are here and I said, in connecting with everyone is wonderful and to, to, but you know, there is, there is a core to it right? And we have the core then you know, you just float above that level and you know, connecting humanity which just got its own value but it's not, it doesn't feel the same to me. And it doesn't feel and it actually makes the connection to humanity less. 

02:27:50
[sil.] 

02:27:55
PETER PEARSON The feeling of being alone and lost. Does that go back to like your family of origin where you would perhaps, a part of you feel alone and lost? 

02:28:05
PAUL I felt like a total free-standing, self-sufficient, individual in the house and that umm… who actually had a responsibility to myself, to try to make it uh… a better situation for everyone not to make it better for them but simply make it better for me. There is just kind of you know, negotiating away in the world and that, you know, that alone is, is something that I don't enjoy. So, when other people are being weird about whatever they feel and I'm sensing it and it's like well, you know, could somebody say something or what does somebody really want or, you know, and it's all, you know the floating tension and uh… I feel in that situation again which is, okay go ahead, how, how much do I have to take care of myself and how much do I take care of people around me so that I can take care of myself. 

02:29:05
[sil.] 

02:29:10
PAUL And it's not a good feeling because when you're a kid growing up, it sucks. 

02:29:15
TRISH Yeah, I mean so often I, when I hear these stories, I cant let… 

02:29:20
PETER PEARSON When I listen to you, right now, right now here is what's standing out for me is that I listen to you. 

02:29:30
TRISH Here is what's standing out for me when I listen to you, it's just, I mean, it just breaks my heart when I think of you as a little boy and I know what if it could be my kids and how I feel and my parents love and I feel that you never had that and it just, it's so sad. I just want to hug you and feel and give you back the childhood that you didn't have that I think you deserved and how you, you know must have felt and a lot of those feelings I'm hearing now and I'm contributing to making you feel them again and that, and that makes me sad beside, you know, I don't want you to feel alone, I want you to feel loved and umm… 

02:30:15
PAUL So one way, I would feel loved is that you respect me enough to umm… you know tell me how you feel. 

02:30:20
PETER PEARSON tell her that, say that again to her Paul, what you just said. Say it again so it sinks into different regions of the brain. 

02:30:30
PAUL What I really appreciate is that if you could accept and actually respect me enough to tell me how you really feel about things, whatever they are so that we can umm… then there is no wondering and we can umm… you know figure it out and make it work and… 

02:30:45
ELLYN BADER Well, when she tells you like that, you don't feel alone because she's… 

02:30:50
PAUL Yeah, because you're actually trusting me with your real feelings and so umm… uh… and that makes me feel, it actually umm… uh… validates for me umm… your trust in me and that umm… you know that I would never, I only do get things with your feelings or your desires. 

02:31:15
PETER PEARSON Now, this is gonna sound strange, but what you're saying Paul is so important. I'm gonna ask you to repeat it again so it… 

02:31:20
PAUL Can we please watch the video. 

02:31:25
PETER PEARSON …yeah, so I mean, it really is important that it reaches different regions of the brain. Not only as Trish hears it, but as you express it yourself. 

02:31:35
PAUL Yeah. 

02:31:35
ELLYN BADER It's easy for me to trust right because, umm… I'll, I'll give myself and feelings and stuff to you so that you can, you know, and right just, and I trust you and if it turns out that my trust was misplaced well then, that's okay I'll, you know, figure something out later right but umm… when you, if you did the same for me then I could, then I would feel umm… you know, that you actually uh… trusted me more than anybody else and that, that's a gift that you could give me. That's better than you know, anything else you could give me so. 

02:32:15
PETER PEARSON Wow. 

02:32:20
ELLYN BADER It's pretty big. 

02:32:20
ELLYN BADER And it's a gift, it's a gift. 

02:32:25
PETER PEARSON Talk to Trish about the gift she can give you by being so clear. Will you tell her what that, what you feel right now as you express that desire, that wish? 

02:32:30
PAUL That's you and me against the world, right. So nobody else would know our, our you know, most intimate thoughts or feelings and whatever those challenges and… 

02:32:45
ELLYN BADER But when you tell her what you feel, when you say to her, how much that would mean to you? 

02:32:45
ELLYN BADER It's a gift. 

02:32:50
PAUL It, it's the, it's the bedrock, it's, it's the safe place in the world. 

02:32:55
PETER PEARSON And you feel what, when you describe that safe place to Trish, you feel what? 

02:33:00
PAUL Well, then I feel umm… loved. 

02:33:05
[sil.] 

02:33:10
TRISH So, what I heard is that when I can share my thoughts and feelings with you and more open with you, it means that I respect you, I care about you, I'm connected to you. You feel loved, it's… 

02:33:20
PAUL Trusted. 

02:33:25
TRISH …trusted, the ultimate gift that I can give you us and how important that is and when I don't do that, all those things are affected. 

02:33:35
PAUL And what is kind of funny because you're trying to give me something by trying to figure out what I want and give me, you know, umm… a more superficial thing right, versus the real thing which is telling me how you feel and, and then it's something that we can hold dear and it's something that we can make happen, it's something we can support and it's something we can do, so which is the connection and the love and the trust all together. 

02:34:05
ELLYN BADER It's her way of saying, she's not gonna leave you swimming out there alone. 

02:34:10
PAUL Yeah, I mean, we're, we're in the puddle together. 

02:34:15
PETER PEARSON And you're not lost. Well, if you are lost, you are lost with a nice companion. 

02:34:25
PAUL Yeah, but then I'm not in Albania or any place else. I'm here, yeah, right. 

02:34:35
TRISH That's you always say, you and me against the world. thank you for sharing that. 

02:34:45
PAUL you're welcome. 

02:34:45
TRISH Really felt it. 

02:34:50
PAUL Me too. 

02:34:55
[sil.] 

02:35:00
TRISH I think, what's so interesting, I mean, this is really profound but what, what he needs and wants is something that's so hard for me to do. It's, you know. 

02:35:10
ELLYN BADER That's why you found each other. 

02:35:10
TRISH It's a hallmark. 

02:35:15
PETER PEARSON How about this, what used to be so hard for you to do, we'll just put a little spin on that for right now. 

02:35:20
TRISH Okay. 

02:35:20
PETER PEARSON What used to be so hard for you to do because, maybe you're not done in here today yet. 

02:35:30
[sil.] 

02:35:35
TRISH It used to be so hard for me in the past, it's been hard for me today. 

02:35:35
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

02:35:40
[sil.] 

02:35:45
ELLYN BADER When I think you're hearing me more today about how much that matters to Paul. 

02:35:50
TRISH Yeah, I think it's the first time I've really heard that. First time you've really said that. 

02:35:55
PAUL In a way that you could hear for sure. 

02:35:55
TRISH Yeah, and then I've always felt that, you know, you felt alone, sometimes with what goes on with me and my family and kids whatever but never umm… how important sharing myself with you makes you validated and connected and loved and that's the greatest gift I can give you. I've never really, you know, felt that till now so, thank you for sharing that. 

02:36:20
PAUL You're welcome. 

02:36:25
ELLYN BADER Paul is there anything else, you want to be sure today before we shift gears? I thought so. 

02:36:30
PAUL Umm… the reason, I work hard sometimes, accepted or get used to it is because umm… uh… when we broke up, the thing I was struggling was this and whether or not it was something that I would accept the challenge on and umm… you know, uh… be willing to find an okay place, uh… feeling uh… not umm… fully connected because I just think you're such a wonderful person. So I have to weigh the fact that there is that the risk of me living like this umm… was worth that to be with you. 

02:37:15
TRISH That you don't feel connected in that? 

02:37:15
PAUL That the connection would be intermittent or umm… inconsistent or umm… incomplete. 

02:37:25
TRISH That you're feeling alone and isolated and not together connected. 

02:37:30
PAUL Yeah, this thing that I just expressed that umm… that, that's what I went off uh… when we broke up to evaluate whether or not, it was worth the risk for me to live like that, yeah. 

02:37:45
PETER PEARSON Pretty profound. Trish, and pretty profound. 

02:37:50
TRISH Yeah, I just thought you want to find someone better. he was on looking for someone better. You know, wow, why didn't you tell that, you never share that with me? 

02:38:00
PAUL No. 

02:38:05
TRISH So you're feeling that way, you even can begin 

02:38:05
PAUL Yeah, I mean, you know, you can see it, right. Like these people, give me. 

02:38:10
TRISH Yeah. 

02:38:15
ELLYN BADER Peter is smart enough to know that you and your kids were a tight package. 

02:38:20
TRISH Yeah. So your fears and concerns you had to weigh between, you know, and it sound like. 

02:38:25
PAUL All the good things we have versus living with this and that's what I chose. 

02:38:30
TRISH And, and they've continued and it sounds like these issues have continued, it must have been hard that you made a decision to commitment yet, all your fears and concerns about these feelings have continued in our relationship. 

02:38:45
PAUL But I valued all the positive things more. 

02:38:45
TRISH Thank you. 

02:38:50
PAUL Maybe it's my own thing, you know, I don't want people to change that much for me, right. 

02:38:55
ELLYN BADER but I think, you haven't actually been asking her to change, what you've been asking her to do is share more who she is. 

02:39:00
PAUL Yeah. 

02:39:05
ELLYN BADER And that when she does, you actually feel more connected and less alone. 

02:39:10
PAUL Yeah, yeah. 

02:39:10
ELLYN BADER And I think that you have thought that it's about how much time you spend together or how much the family is together and all of that. But he really wants to know you. He wants to know, but I would hope you could take away from what you did today is, Paul once you really decided to go ahead and be an initiator, you went with it and you really opened yourself up. And you were honest about feelings are not easy and you were honest. And you really, and you really did worked to hear, to listen, to ask him more and to give him the space to tell you about it umm… and even though you felt I think like, you would like to take away what he was feeling or you would like to make it go away, you sat with it and you stayed with it. And those are skills that each of you can build on and do more with it, that will be really valuable long term. 

02:40:15
Working with Trish's Internal Conflict 

02:40:15
PETER PEARSON So part of your struggle is there, is a part of you that wants to do what Paul wants you to do, is to be more clear. The benefits of doing that would be what? 

02:40:25
TRISH Well, I think the benefits to Paul in our relationship was that, he would feel you know, trusted and, and respected and loved and cared for and we're more connected and that's the primary thing I heard from him. 

02:40:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, the benefits to you. 

02:40:40
TRISH To me, I think would be umm… something I've struggled with. I didn't even be clear on what I'm feeling now. I'd have to really be figure it out, meet someone else that I'll take the time to do that and I would get to know myself better and share myself. 

02:41:00
PETER PEARSON However, you have an alter ego. 

02:41:00
TRISH I do. 

02:41:00
PETER PEARSON We need to hear from the alter ego. So come over here and sit here and… you're the alter ego that says, well, that sounds really good, it sounds noble, it sounds positive, it sounds connecting. However, and this is the yes but form over here and from over here, you would say what to her. 

02:41:25
TRISH Growing up, you know, it didn't work just better do, you know, keep your mouth shut and… 

02:41:30
PETER PEARSON Keep my mouth shut. I knew, it's better to keep my mouth shut. 

02:41:30
TRISH Keep my mouth shut and… 

02:41:35
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

02:41:35
TRISH …you know, my role has always been the peacemaker so just you know, don't want to rock the boat. There is already enough tension and stuff going on in my family that you just still want to… 

02:41:45
PETER PEARSON I didn't want to add to it. 

02:41:45
TRISH …I didn't want to add to it and I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut and you know, and I'm worried about what the, you know, this person is saying that, that person is saying and all these other people, what's going on so, I didn't know, what I'm saying, so I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut. 

02:42:00
PETER PEARSON I'll just keep my mouth shut. Yup and then hope for the best. 

02:42:05
TRISH Yes. I'll be safer, I'm gonna be a lot safer if I keep my mouth shut. Yeah, specially with my family. 

02:42:10
PETER PEARSON With, especially with my family. Keep my mouth shut. That's the marching orders of the day. That's great. Now, come over here and what would you say back to her? 

02:42:20
TRISH Well, how well was that work? 

02:42:25
[sil.] 

02:42:30
PETER PEARSON She might say like, we're growing up, it was the best solution I had. So growing up, yeah, it was the best. 

02:42:35
TRISH That's true. 

02:42:35
PETER PEARSON That's true. 

02:42:35
TRISH I survived. 

02:42:35
PETER PEARSON What would you like to say to her? 

02:42:40
TRISH Umm… well, you paid a big price for that. 

02:42:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

02:42:45
TRISH In your life. 

02:42:45
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

02:42:45
TRISH Not knowing what you want, not getting what you want, umm… being resentful and angry later because you didn't got what you want, but because you didn't even ask for it. 

02:42:55
PETER PEARSON Right, so you spared yourself a lot of disappointment by not speaking up and being disappointed. So in that sense, it was kind of a solution. 

02:43:05
TRISH It worked for a while. 

02:43:05
PETER PEARSON For a while, yeah, great, come back over here. This is good. From over here now, that however, what would you say back? 

02:43:10
TRISH I like worked for all these years, so I just keep, keep doing it and certainly the easier way out and getting involved in all these umm… discussions and arguments and umm… and you don't get your voice heard and need to meet anyway, so I bother. 

02:43:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, it's a simpler way out. I don't know, if it would be an easier way because of, you know, you're willing to pay a price today but you're paying a bigger price tomorrow and the day after. But for today, in the immediate situation. 

02:43:45
TRISH It, it seems easier. 

02:43:45
PETER PEARSON It seems easier or simpler. 

02:43:45
TRISH Simpler. 

02:43:50
ELLYN BADER And safer. Safer, right, a lot safer just to keep my mouth shut and not risk wading into that potential conflict territory. 

02:44:00
PETER PEARSON You might say to her look, you got all those reasons but frankly, I prefer a little security and safety. Would that be fair? 

02:44:05
TRISH Yeah. 

02:44:10
PETER PEARSON All right. 

02:44:10
TRISH And I'm comfortable with it. I've done it that way all my life. You don't know what you're getting into. 

02:44:15
PETER PEARSON Listen, I understand the rules and regulations and schematics from over here and you want to upset my equanimity. 

02:44:25
TRISH To 60 years of this5. 

02:44:25
PETER PEARSON Yeah, what you want to do, what? So come back over here She's fighting for her safety. What would you say to her? 

02:44:35
TRISH You know, you've done it this way for a long time but you paid a big price for it and it has always gotten you what you want. It hasn't always worked and it's not very satisfying or fulfilling. 

02:44:45
PETER PEARSON Yeah, ultimately, it's not very satisfying. 

02:44:50
TRISH Ultimately, it's not very satisfying or fulfilling and you feel like your needs aren't being met and you know, you're getting older in life as you know, who knows how much longer you have but you know, it's this way, you really want to live your life and… 

02:45:05
PETER PEARSON All growth requires a temporary surrender of our security. 

02:45:10
TRISH That's a good one. 

02:45:10
PETER PEARSON You agree with that from over there? 

02:45:10
TRISH All right, I do. 

02:45:10
PETER PEARSON That growth requires a temporary surrender of our security and safety. 

02:45:15
TRISH Alright, I'm definitely with that. 

02:45:20
PETER PEARSON That sounds good to you over here. All right, come back over here. What would you say back to her? 

02:45:25
TRISH Well, I'd say, go ahead and take your chances, if that's what you want to do. 

02:45:30
PETER PEARSON What's the attitude. Go ahead and take your chances. 

02:45:35
TRISH Go forward and see him. 

02:45:35
PETER PEARSON Now, here is what's great about what I hear you saying is that you're willing to experiment. That's what from over here and that's crucial that you're willing to experiment from over here so you don't feel like you're gonna have to be, maybe stuck in this forever experimenting and you, you can always go back to the way it was. I want you to hear that from this side. You can always go back to the way it was. Take a relaxing breath and let that in. You can always go back to the way it was. 

02:46:05
TRISH I can always go back to the way it was, if it doesn't work. 

02:46:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, if it doesn't work. Come back over here please for a second. What do you appreciate about what she brings to the table? 

02:46:15
TRISH I appreciate that you… umm… just help me adapt to life growing up and then my family and, and try to protect me and make it safe and maybe easier for me and it's a way that I can, I got through life and my family. 

02:46:35
PETER PEARSON And that's really important that you also appreciate it from that perspective as well. This is what got her through. 

02:46:40
TRISH Right and if you, you're my family, what you do. I had to do that. 

02:46:45
PAUL Yeah. 

02:46:50
PETER PEARSON And see what you're bringing to the table is basically you're saying to her, maybe it's time to update your coping mechanisms because the family that I am creating now is different than the family where you made this decisions. Would that be fair? 

02:47:05
TRISH Totally fair. Very different. 

02:47:10
PETER PEARSON Could you say something like that to her? 

02:47:10
TRISH Yeah, I could say, you know, I don't really need you anymore. I've survived my family of origin and I'm in a new family now that doesn't behave the same way. 

02:47:20
PETER PEARSON I might modify a bit. Instead of saying, I don't need you anymore, because I think she still is important because she helps you be aware what other people feel. 

02:47:30
TRISH I don't want to lose that, yes. 

02:47:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, that's what I mean. So it's not like you want to just totally discard her, I think she has so many important dimensions that she brings to the relationship that you can appreciate. 

02:47:40
TRISH So I think, then I would like to say thank you for helping me in, in umm… navigating my childhood, my youth with my family and you help me get through sometimes and I appreciate that and but I also appreciate now that you are willing to try something different and see where how it works and that I don't have to hold onto the old ways of speak that's what I needed. 

02:48:05
PETER PEARSON Yeah, and still maintain some of that sensitivity to others. 

02:48:10
TRISH Yes, I want to continue to maintain that. 

02:48:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, come over here, back over here and what would you say back to her. 

02:48:15
TRISH Thank you for acknowledging what I did for you and not totally throwing me away. 

02:48:20
PETER PEARSON Totally, totally. 

02:48:25
TRISH Umm… appreciating the, the parts that I, I helped you with whether it's being sensitive to the people around me and caring about them… 

02:48:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

02:48:35
TRISH …then, that I want to continue to have that in my life but umm… 

02:48:40
PETER PEARSON What, what do you feel when you say, it's, I'm glad to know that you still want me to be part of your life? What's that like, when you say that? 

02:48:45
TRISH Umm… it feels like accepted uh… heard, not rejected. 

02:48:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

02:48:55
TRISH That was important part of me. 

02:48:55
PETER PEARSON And you're giving her a gift of willingness to experiment that you can support for a while. 

02:49:00
TRISH Yeah. 

02:49:00
PETER PEARSON What a gift, what a gift. 

02:49:05
TRISH Yeah. 

02:49:10
PETER PEARSON What do you feel when you say this? 

02:49:10
TRISH I feel very lucky that I've had this support and that we can work it out and try something different together. 

02:49:20
PETER PEARSON Together, together. 

02:49:20
TRISH Together. 

02:49:20
PETER PEARSON I like the acronym for team. TEAM, Together each accomplishes more. Within you and between you. 

02:49:35
[sil.] 

02:49:40
PETER PEARSON Now go over here. Think of a word, an image or a phrase that you think might capture, the collaboration between these two parts. 

02:49:55
TRISH I don't know. I think the first thing that comes to me is acceptance. 

02:49:55
PETER PEARSON Acceptance, so here is what I'd like you to do. When you and Paul are discussing something and there is something you would like that's important to you but this part shows up just out of the condition reflex. Take a deep breath and go, acceptance. Acceptance and it will bring back that term acceptance. We'll bring back by association what you've done in here today which then allows you to take the risk, to step forward and say, and this is what I would like, I think. Acceptance, so it doesn't have to be fully formed in order for you to speak up. But often in the process of talking about something, it starts to become clearer to us. So I don't want you to think, it's gotta be totally clear ahead of time. Does that make sense? 

02:50:50
TRISH Yeah and actually that's good because I think a lot of times I'm not even clear and so that I just don't say anything. It's, I, you know and other people much quick to get to… 

02:51:00
ELLYN BADER That's why it matters so much for Paul to ask you a lot of questions and really show that interest. 

02:51:05
PETER PEARSON Here is where you guys can work together. The two of you are talking and you say something and you go. I think there is something in here that's important to me and you say to Paul, acceptance and now here is how you guys work as a team. You say, Paul acceptance. That's your cue to ask questions. 

02:51:20
PAUL Okay. 

02:51:25
PETER PEARSON That's your cue to say, all right, there is something you want to say, right. There is something important floating around. Is that right and you go, yeah Paul, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is yet but it's floating out there, it's orbiting. Yeah, I want reel it in and say what it is and you say, great take your time, just make some speculations, that's okay. And then you are working on your best behalf to help her get clear as well and now you guys are really working as a team to get through this. Is that cool or what? 

02:51:55
PAUL Yeah. 

02:51:55
TRISH That's great. It's amazing. 

02:52:00
PAUL Yeah. 

02:52:00
TRISH Yeah. 

02:52:00
PAUL I like it. 

02:52:00
PETER PEARSON All right. 

02:52:05
ELLYN BADER Can you say to Paul if this feels true and getting close to you and creating a family with you doesn't mean I'm recreating my family of origin. 

02:52:15
TRISH I like that. Often, I feel like I had to. I'm getting close to you, it does not make me feel I have to recreate my family of origin. 

02:52:30
PAUL Good. 

02:52:35
ELLYN BADER Or that I am recreating. 

02:52:35
TRISH Or that I am recreating, yeah that I am recreating my family of origin. 

02:52:35
PETER PEARSON Now take a big relaxing breath and tell him one more time, so that it sinks in even deeper. 

02:52:45
TRISH Getting close to you does not mean that I am recreating my family of origin or have to recreate my family of origin. 

02:52:55
PETER PEARSON We will create our own family. 

02:52:55
TRISH We will create our own family, you and me. 

02:53:00
PAUL Both together. 

02:53:05
PETER PEARSON Together, each accomplishes more. 

02:53:05
TRISH Yes, team. Together each accomplishes more right. 

02:53:10
PAUL Yeah. 

02:53:10
TRISH Life feel like round the journey. 

02:53:10
PAUL Yeah. 

02:53:15
TRISH This is just helping a lot. 

02:53:15
PETER PEARSON Cool.

02:53:40
ELLYN BADER Hello, I'm Ellyn Bader and this is my husband Peter Pearson. Thanks for joining us for the second session with Trish and Paul. We suggest that you consider watching the clinical pieces first, watching them all the way through and then come back and join us here while we teach and do commentary as we stop the session and talk about why we intervened at particular places. As this session get started, what we want to do is check back on what happened in the first session. We want to find out the reactions to the paper exercise, we want to know a little bit about what's happened during the week, umm… and how they responded to the questions that Peter was asking and so we begin by asking them for that kind of feedback. 

02:54:30
Trish & Paul 

02:54:30
Session # 2 

02:54:30
with commentary 

02:54:30
ELLYN BADER We'd love to hear what stood out each of you from last time? So that might get right into what you were. 

02:54:35
PETER PEARSON The main headlines of when we met last time to today. So just some quick headlines of the state of the union. 

02:54:45
TRISH Well, so I think, you know, we're waiting to together to write our comments which we all have part for, took the, some of the keys in time and I think we both are very effective in getting to umm… the heart of the matter, quickly without you knowing us. It seem like, umm… the way you ask questions and, and the way umm… uh… discussions went, we dealt with things and got each to validate each other's feelings about where we were at and rating, that rating system was very helpful. I thought and I'd never done it before to say, yes, we were, we realized we were pretty much right on a lot of things but also umm… you know, the things that you picked up on and then delved into different areas, I think that the yellow paper was a very interesting exercise. Forget about the paper. It matters to me to know what, what you said. 

02:55:45
PAUL I'll tell you that later but, it doesn't matter. 

02:55:45
TRISH I don't know, if you want to add, add things for it. 

02:55:50
PAUL Umm… you know, it kind of think, because I was, a process a little bit to say that the, the exercises or the questions were very good, constructive for us as well as uh… informative, you know, revealing and informative to you guys so you can actually then, you know, be more empowered to help us and stuff so that's, I thought that technique was great and it was, you know, helpful to us to you know look at things in ways. 

02:56:15
TRISH You know, I guess I would love to ask Paul, how he felt with, you know, this wedding was a family wedding and all my extended family some of which he had never met and including him in that even though he wasn't there for the whole time. He was there for the three or four day wedding events. How you felt and if you felt included? 

02:56:35
PAUL Yes. We just uh… a little background they flew meeting Trisha, Christopher and Courtney, the two kids and then Trish's sister and her nephew, yeah. 

02:56:45
TRISH We were both single moms and raised our kids together. So we were quite, vacations and everything together. Our parents died when my son was born, so I think you know, the five of us did a lot together and you know, when Paul came in the picture was always kind of hard to put it in, not just me and my kids but even my sister and her son and the comfort of doing vacations together, because, we'd all like to sleep all in the same room or the same tent or whatever. 

02:57:05
PAUL And so then, it's like well, where would I sleep? 

02:57:10
TRISH It's like, you know, separate tents and my kids like well, no that's just wont work, we want you in my tent, you know, and it just change things, you know, it's been hard process for us both, I think to go through. 

02:57:20
ELLYN BADER Let me ask you each to think about, you know, what would you most like us to focus on today, like if you really walked out of here and said, I'm so glad, we focused on that? 

02:57:30
TRISH I still think that umm… you know, the yellow paper was pretty profound. So it feels like, there is something more to explore there, maybe. 

02:57:40
ELLYN BADER I was so delighted to have Trish actually say that she was feeling some what unsettled that the paper exercise was profound for her. It was profound because she broke through those tears and realized how much it meant to her to have Paul be genuinely interested in her and to be able to help her bring forward, what matters to her and so she's given us as entry to work with some of her issues in this next session. Something more to pay attention to from the paper exercise. 

02:58:20
TRISH Yeah, but I also think there's other issue constantly comes out. 

02:58:20
PAUL This issue that we are talking about has been you know, probably the most difficult one for us. 

02:58:25
PETER PEARSON The issue of inclusion? 

02:58:30
TRISH I think that's the biggest issue. Maybe it's not the whole. 

02:58:35
PAUL Well. It, it maybe related to the paper exercise because, somewhere in the discussion, we got to Trish's willingness to take a risk or extend herself in the relationship. Am I correct, you saw it yesterday? And umm… that the inclusion thing to me has been part of that which is, how big umm… how to extend an invitation to me without putting yourself at risk or umm… uh… you know, what are your feelings versus the feelings of those around you and how do you weigh those things and so that, that came up last time but I'm not sure, so… 

02:59:20
ELLYN BADER Well let me, maybe a good thing would be if, if I summarized a few things that I saw in the paper exercise. 

02:59:30
PAUL Okay. 

02:59:30
ELLYN BADER Umm… and then umm… we can still navigate our way to what we are gonna do today. 

02:59:35
PAUL Okay. 

02:59:35
ELLYN BADER Umm… but one of the reasons that we usually give that exercise is that it's very revealing with partners in terms of seeing a couple of things. One of those is umm… does each person really say what mattered to them or say what was important, what, what you selected that was important to you umm… and then usually that raises some conflict because, I mean, there is some purposeful conflict built into that exercise because you're not gonna pick the same thing and that's life often two people want different things at the same time. Then we look at how do you take the desire that you have for two different things and figure out what's important to you and how do you explore what's important to Paul and how does Paul explore what's important to you umm… deeply enough that then you can realize what it is you're solving because so often, I think I said this in that session actually, sometimes couples go way too fast and they're solving a problem before they really know what's underneath or what it is they're solving and so umm… one of the things that I saw happen when you got to see it last time is Paul you were right in there ready to negotiate like, let's, let's negotiate a solution really quickly and you were saying, but wait, you know, umm… I want, I want to know what you picked and you also wanted Paul to show more interest in you… I'm going back and really give them feedback again about what I saw in the paper exercise and the reason for that again is that I want to use what happened to create more forward movement on the issues that surface two weeks before. I want to take those issues and be able to move them forward in this session. …and in fact that's where you got teary-eyed was wanting Paul to be able to explore your reality more before needing to get to a solution. 

03:01:50
TRISH I reacted to him not you know, asking what it was for me umm… that was my biggest, I think reaction. 

03:02:00
ELLYN BADER Yeah, you did react, you wanted Paul to ask more about why it was important to you. I mean, what it was first of all, yeah. Yeah, yeah exactly. 

03:02:10
TRISH The next steps but. 

03:02:10
ELLYN BADER And you talked a lot about having been a single parent and being on your own and having Paul's interest, having Paul real true interest in you is something that you missed a lot for many years as you've been a single parent and so that in fact was very meaningful to you to have him care and have him want to know, want to know you more deeply. 

03:02:35
TRISH And I think his response felt like he cared. I mean, it felt very caring that way to way he was willing to give me what I wanted and not even ask and, and just, you know, and that felt very touching in some ways, that he was going to do it but we didn't even talk about what it was or what, you know so that was kind of interesting to me. I mean there's part of me feels like you know, you generally care more do whatever but then there was that deeper part that almost feels like, yeah, I was in… 

03:03:05
ELLYN BADER That feels what, there is a deeper part that feels what? 

03:03:10
TRISH That it's almost superficial or not really. I don't think superficial, it's not the right, I don't know how to describe it but feeling was that, it just because you care about me, you want to be nice and you just want to give it to me but not really know what it's all about. 

03:03:25
PETER PEARSON It's almost like you don't want Paul to surrender himself most of the time just to respond to you. It's like you, you want something back from him as well. Uh… 

03:03:35
TRISH Yeah. 

03:03:40
ELLYN BADER Being the independent single mom who did everything on your own for so long umm… has its strength and things that you've really taken from that umm… and it also has its loneliness side and that when Paul explored more deeply with you that, that is something you want but you're also little afraid of, that it's both, you want that deeper level of intimacy of knowing each other even more and am I making correct? 

03:04:10
TRISH Yeah, and I think it's hard for me because I haven't really been or had that at that level and then I think it's also a little scary because you know, you could lose it again and you know. I'm saying that just intellectually, I don't, I mean, I'm sure I feel that but… 

03:04:30
ELLYN BADER You're, did you say, you're sure you feel or you're not sure? 

03:04:30
TRISH Well, I, my guess is that's what, you know, is behind it, why it's hard for me… 

03:04:35
ELLYN BADER So here she's eluding to the loss and the loss that happened with him although, it's not really stated at this point but she recognizes that if she lets herself surrender to a deeper level of intimacy with him, she is risking, risking the fact that he could indeed leave again. 

03:05:00
PAUL …because I know it's hard for me, you know, umm… but, but then I don't know how much is that it's that the kind of person I am you know, I've always been that way, so it's hard for me to let those, you know, down and be more vulnerable or umm… just because I've never done it very much because I've been on my own pretty much or because I'm also afraid of what that means, I don't know, afraid of losing him. 

03:05:30
ELLYN BADER And it's probably some of all of that. 

03:05:30
TRISH Yeah. 

03:05:30
ELLYN BADER Probably, so I mean and in fact we talk at the end the last time about umm… Paul having broken up with you for a while too and so, and, and at a period where umm… you were trying to figure out were she right, was this what you wanted and you had really decided he was the guy for you and then that was hard during that period of time and so now you've reinvested again and there is that part that wants more connection. 

03:06:05
TRISH I felt torn a lot, you know, wanting to spend time with him doing things with him. He want to often do things just with me not with all of us. Him wanting to, you know, spending those and then you know, there is everything else in life, work and friends and family and you know, and I think that's one of my issues that I don't ask for what I want enough or don't stick to it, you know, in that, now I just got a flashback that my daughter is leaving in two weeks, I remember, earlier and that you're saying this is your last year, one night a week, I want to have with her and not do anything and now the year is over and I really haven't done that. But I didn't, we talked about it and we write it, enforcing, okay, this is our night, you know, you go do something or well, so, you know, it made me just kind of, I don't know… 

03:06:50
ELLYN BADER That's the paper exercise, right. 

03:06:55
TRISH I didn't ask for what I wanted, you know, I didn't. insist on it. 

03:07:00
PAUL Oh you did. 

03:07:00
TRISH I asked but then, but then. 

03:07:00
PAUL I'd say, yeah, no problem. Was, was I supposed to do… 

03:07:05
PETER PEARSON A part of you caved, you know. A part of you. 

03:07:10
TRISH Didn't say, I need my, and I was, I couldn't make it every Wednesday night or every whatever yeah, I didn't, didn't enforce it or I didn't want to enforce it. But I pursue it and demanded even I mean, surely that's a strong word for me but I didn't yeah, or didn't take initiatives just make it happen. 

03:07:25
ELLYN BADER Right, it's all of those. 

03:07:25
TRISH All of those things and it's… 

03:07:30
ELLYN BADER In the paper exercise, before we finished, you said to Paul umm… something that was like, you know, don't you want to know what I picked and he said I'm fine, I know we can negotiate it. 

03:07:40
TRISH It doesn't matter. 

03:07:45
ELLYN BADER And so and then you let it finish. You know, you didn't say wait, it matters to me that you ask me. 

03:07:50
TRISH Yeah, I didn't do that, right, I just let it go, accepted it. So I do a lot. 

03:07:55
ELLYN BADER Yeah. 

03:07:55
PETER PEARSON This is an interesting way about how in a sense they unconsciously both protect each other from being more differentiate. Trish will not say or does not say this is what is important to me and Paul doesn't do anything to illicit that information from Trish. So it's a way of keeping their boundaries, their negotiations, their communication really, really mushy and intuitive, maybe they will get it right with the other person once on occasion. However what we often tell couples is that telepathy is an unreliable form of communication. And that, that was my point that there is a part of you have this conflict. The good news is a part of you can identify what you want or what's important. Good, good, good news. The downside is there is another part of you that will cave in too quickly uh… and give it up. 

03:08:55
TRISH A big part of me. 

03:08:55
PETER PEARSON Yeah and not and that phenomena with you, I think is also a problem for Paul because he wants the clarity from you, the changing clarity, the evolving clarity. He wants the clarity. Tell me what it is Trish that you really want now and or later and don't give up on it. 

03:09:20
PAUL So just to be clear, I don't want you to give in on anything and if it's important to you, it should be important to you and you know, we can then you know, weigh the importance of each other and figure out some solution right and talk about it but umm… 

03:09:35
ELLYN BADER Does that mean that you can tolerate some tension for a little while, while you figure it out? 

03:09:40
PAUL Yeah, right in the process of figuring out, the tension of not really doing whether or not saying, what you want or whatever, that's the, that's the unsettling part right. 

03:09:50
PETER PEARSON On a scale of 1 to 10, how unsettling is that phenomena for you? Not knowing. Not knowing Trish, her priorities etc. 

03:10:05
PAUL Umm… it's not that, not knowing as much as it's the umm… you know, so I grew up in a family with two alcoholic parents, lots of you know, uh… umm… unsaid tension, unspoken tension and so, you know, I was I grew up sensing at, what it was going on and figuring out how to survive in this day, in this moment and umm… you know, at some point, I learnt to get kind of beyond that and you know, and let people be people and as much as possible but you know, I'm in there, still some theft there. So umm… I don't appreciate that right, you know, because it's like well we should just talk about what it is and you know, when… 

03:10:45
ELLYN BADER Get it out in the open. 

03:10:50
PAUL Yeah and, you know be real about it, right and so… 

03:10:50
ELLYN BADER Each of them are talking about some very core things. Paul is talking about his childhood and how alone he felt with two alcoholic parents and how much that can be recreated in the family that he has with Trish when she and her kids bond together and he feels so excluded and left out. And how painful that is for him. 

03:11:15
PAUL …so at sometimes the tension has been very high, a 10 or 11. 

03:11:25
PETER PEARSON The unspoken things can create some high tension at times. 

03:11:30
PAUL Yeah. Right, right and it's kind of that lack of trust or the lack of understanding of intimacy, right umm… and there was one time but couple of years ago or something where umm… they uh… Trish was having problem with some computer thing and she there is, I said out loud well, what's my password and so, you know, for something and then, you know so the kids like, alright, Christopher had to like write the password and goes this side, you know and stuff and so we've talked about passwords and you know, so I knew what the password was but it was like, you know, you know, we, at this point we've been together years, you know and, you know whatever the dynamic and tension and thing about them versus what I would do with the password, you know, after all these years, it's kind of like, you know, what, what is this, right so and I actually got upset, I got to go for a walk and I left for a couple of hours, you know, and just went off into the hills walking and you know came back, you know, much, much later and then told her what that thing was, right. Because I just, it was like, this is, this is too much for me, right now, so. 

03:12:40
TRISH And I guess, I thought, I couldn't blame my kids, they didn't know anything or, you know, I don't know. 

03:12:45
PAUL Well, I don't really blame them either but just, you know that situation which is, you know, of, you know, not accepting us to a degree is what it means to me that they don't accept us, it's that, you know, that it's still, it's still well, there is mom and there is Paul as opposed to there is them. 

03:13:10
ELLYN BADER At this stage in the session, I decide to introduce the initiator inquirer process. One big reason for that is I want them to engage more directly with each other in the intensity of the emotions that they shy away from. This is a process that Peter and I have developed that looks like, it's actually a communication process but it's far more than that. The way that each row in this process is define, it's designed so it will push the developmental capacities of each partner and again, we look for places that each of them break down and so that they can get developmental assists from us in those roles that will enable them to handle more intensity, to handle their differences, to allow more intimacy between the two of them. So I'm about to introduce the process to Trish and Paul. 

03:14:05
Initiator Inquirer 

03:14:10
ELLYN BADER Pete and I have a way that we teach couples often how to talk about issues in a way that really locates what belongs to each person and so that there is a lot of attention on one side at a time and not kind of the going back and forth and I think it might be really valuable to try that for a few minutes, in here, that's okay with you. Here is basically the way we think about it which is that you know, when kids are in kindergarten they learn about taking turns. But once we grow up we forget about the idea of taking turns and so we teach a process called the initiator Inquirer basically where one of you is the person who has the issue whatever or feelings, you say it I'm feeling X or Y about this particular topic and I would like to talk to you about it and so the initiator is the person who has got the issue, who brings up the topic, who says what they feel about it and who when it goes really well, actually learns more about themselves, when they're done talking about it then they knew when they started. For example, if you were the initiator, that would mean Paul asking you more deeply about yourself in a way that you're suggesting you would like it last time. That's the initiators role. The inquirer's role is first to listen to be sure, you understand what you're being told, then to ask questions and then those questions are designed to really go deeper, so you would be asking Paul for example, if he was initiating a bad feeling excluded. You would really be asking him more about his feelings of exclusion. If she was talking about her feelings of being pulled in so many different directions, you would be asking her more deeply, you know, about that feeling of being pulled in so many directions. But then what makes the inquirer role different is really asking enough until you can really get out of yourself and empathize with the other person's experience. So it's truly an expression of empathy. So for you, it might be about what Paul has felt trying to feel more included in the family or for you it might be feeling and getting more deeply how much she struggles with feeling so pulled that she doesn't tell you directly what she really wants. And you really stay with that empathy until you get to a soothing moment, you get to that moment of deeper connection when you say, hey, he really heard me, he really got me and you know, you both learn something more about each other when you're done. So does that sound like? 

03:16:55
TRISH Yeah. 

03:16:55
PAUL Yeah. 

03:16:55
PETER PEARSON A worthwhile endeavor. 

03:16:55
TRISH Yes definitely. 

03:17:00
ELLYN BADER So I'm describing the initiator inquirer process to Trish and Paul and as I do that I want to be sure first of all that the roles are really clearly described to them so that they know what they're going to do depending on which role they're occupying. The initiator being the one who brings up the issue, the one who describes that issue without blame, without name calling and expressing their thoughts and feelings and being open to self-discovery. And the inquirer being the one who will listen and who will ask question from a state of genuine curiosity. Doing their best to empathize so that they get to that place of connection, that soothing moment. So I describe the roles and as I do that, I'm giving them some examples of some things that they might bring up. And I'm purposely selecting those so that they hear me state them and some of those are things that again I know will push their development, it will help them move forward, if they select some of those issues when they are talking with each other. So here I ask them to choose which one of them is going to initiate and which one is going to inquire. And I'll even do this. I'll give you a well, first of all, how about if you guys decide who is gonna initiate and who's gonna inquire? 

03:18:25
TRISH Okay, which is which's position? 

03:18:30
PAUL Initiate means that like you, you talk about umm…. 

03:18:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, you initiate the discussion, the topic. 

03:18:35
TRISH And then the inquirer asks. 

03:18:35
PAUL Yeah, to prop more deeply to understand. You can initiate, if you'd like to talk about. 

03:18:40
TRISH No, you can initiate. 

03:18:45
Many partners want the other to two first in exposing vulnerability. 

03:18:50
PAUL Okay, I'm happy to do it. 

03:18:50
TRISH Okay. We'll turn on the topic. 

03:18:50
ELLYN BADER All right, so Paul's gonna initiate. 

03:18:55
TRISH Yes. 

03:18:55
ELLYN BADER Okay. So we'll let you take a look at that side. I mean, that's designed so it can actually stand on a table between you but. You can… 

03:19:00
TRISH I'm the inquirer. 

03:19:00
ELLYN BADER Yes. So as you're thinking Paul, think focus on one issue like if you can pull it down to one. 

03:19:15
PAUL Yeah, umm… so umm… as I, as I tried to think about it, you know about this issue what umm… uh… it kind of goes back to when I, when we talked about the wedding and things that happened at the wedding and I support, yeah, you know, I mean, I kind of accepted a lot of these and umm… you know, it's just the way it is and there is not that much to do about it so. 

03:19:40
ELLYN BADER But does it still matter enough that you would want Trish to understand it better and understand you better in that regard? 

03:19:50
PAUL Umm… well you know when we asked what you know, what we, in that umm… when the first exercise about what do you think the other person thinks or feels and I think she knows this umm… 

03:20:05
PETER PEARSON Is this the initiating topic? 

03:20:10
ELLYN BADER She's trying to decide. 

03:20:10
PAUL On one that I want to initiate in truth because umm… the thing that made it harder for me was your lack of clarity on what you wanted and you know, communicating that. 

03:20:25
TRISH That's my thing but I think we are focusing on your thing. It was an issue for you right. Because… 

03:20:30
PETER PEARSON If he's the initiator. 

03:20:30
TRISH …because just like the umm… the password thing, I mean the thing with the computer just a few weeks ago and that was pretty hard. 

03:20:40
PAUL The computer a few weeks ago? 

03:20:40
TRISH Yeah with Courtney's gift you know, and how you felt about that. I think it's the same feeling like you're being left out and excluded. I mean, it's sort of still is coming up not for any blame or reason but with situations. Oh, I remember that one. 

03:21:00
ELLYN BADER So you're inviting Paul to talk to you about it. 

03:21:05
TRISH Yeah, that is not totally… 

03:21:05
ELLYN BADER And Paul, I think it's good that you're like saying, okay, let me get focused here, let me think out something that does matter to me. 

03:21:15
[sil.] 

03:21:20
PAUL Umm… umm… okay, it's, it's a little hard for me because the question is what time, so on those things about what day it is where it's… 

03:21:30
ELLYN BADER And truly, if you don't want to initiate, you can ask Trish if she would. I mean, you don't have to, if there is nothing that's you're tapping into that you have some emotion about it, that you care about it. 

03:21:40
PAUL Well, I do, I do care, I mean I have cared a lot about this and I do care about it. You know, I just try to get myself into you know, a happy existence place where they're right, you know, maybe not the happiest place all time but you know, I mean there is a lot more in life to worry about, right. 

03:22:00
ELLYN BADER So you trying to get to a place of acceptance and… 

03:22:00
PAUL Yeah, right[. 

03:22:00
ELLYN BADER …but it still matters. 

03:22:05
PAUL Umm… uh… 

03:22:05
PETER PEARSON A part of you still has some charge on it when you think about it? 

03:22:10
PAUL Yeah, and I can, I can find that charge. So it was, so. 

03:22:15
PETER PEARSON Okay. It's, as an initiator, it's good to talk about something that is part of that still has a charge about. 

03:22:20
PAUL Right, right. Okay, so I'll try to do it from the self-discovery perspective. 

03:22:25
PETER PEARSON We took time to be sure which one of them was going to initiate and then took time with Paul to really be sure that it was an issue that mattered to him. What we want is an issue that's going to have some emotional impact. Now there are times with a couple particularly a really fighting, angry couple where you might have them select something positive and share something positive but in the case of a couple that are intensity avoiding and conflict avoiding like Trish and Paul, we really want them to move into something with an emotional charge. 

03:23:00
[sil.] 

03:23:10
ELLYN BADER Okay, are you ready? 

03:23:10
PAUL Yeah. 

03:23:10
ELLYN BADER Okay, so can you guys just look at each other? 

03:23:15
PAUL All right, this is umm… it's kind of weird because this is, it gets raised as an issue and it comes up as an issue between us but it's really an expression of who I am and who I, you know, how I want to live and who and how I express myself and each of our lives are filled with multiple relationships but ultimately for me, umm… I've chosen you to be umm… my most important relationship and even though I've got other really important relationships in my life, it certainly doesn't make them unimportant but my choice is that, I choose you to be the relationship that matters the most to me to be sustained in those two, you know, in a daily coming and going basis umm… uh… you know, for it to be us and umm… and I don't just do that uh… in the past, I do that today. Umm… so with that in mind, umm… what happens a lot is that when you turn away from me or, or exclude me in certain ways or don't think of, of me as a, as a umm… as you know your primary relationship then umm… you know, I feel lost. 

03:24:50
[sil.] 

03:24:55
ELLYN BADER It's okay. Take your time. 

03:25:00
[sil.] 

03:25:05
TRISH It's huge. 

03:25:05
PAUL So umm… so when all these things when there is reminders about us not being us, they, uh… you know, they just remind me that we are not us and that other people, you know, don't think of us as us. 

03:25:25
ELLYN BADER So as Paul begins to cry, we know that it's a significant issue for him and that it's something that touches him. But we want to see where they can go with it first without our intervention. That's going to help us again to be able to see how they get stuck or where we can provide the best assistance to help them move forward. 

03:25:50
PAUL And that makes me feel less like us. 

03:25:55
[sil.] 

03:26:00
ELLYN BADER And can you, you feel hurt or sad or tell her what those, a little more about the emotion. 

03:26:05
PAUL Well, yeah, I mean, I feel umm… you know, I guess mostly then umm… I feel alone. Which is you know, not a safe and happy place kind of just going through a little, umm… 

03:26:25
[sil.] 

03:26:35
TRISH I'm not sure, how I'm supposed to talk. 

03:26:35
ELLYN BADER Can you ask him a little… 

03:26:40
PETER PEARSON Before you ask him, what will you tell Paul, what stands out for you as you listen to him describe this process? Yeah, what are you hearing that really stands out for you? 

03:26:55
TRISH Umm… a couple of things. One is how important I am to you than to him. Umm… it's you know, kind of mind-boggling. Umm… but how umm… how hard and how alone and you didn't use the word sad but that makes me sad when I hear how you describe me, how you feel. One of these things happened umm… and how it umm… makes us feel disconnected in that we are not us anymore and even though I think a lot of these things are beyond us, the fact that it makes you feel umm… so alone is, is really umm… it makes me feel very different about a lot of these things and I often get defensive or makes excuses or explain the kids or explain me what really I'm hearing is how you feel on that really umm… it's just pretty profound how, how deep this feeling is for you and how, what is it and how, you know, I don't want you to ever feel that way, you know, it makes me sad that you do feel that way. 

03:28:15
ELLYN BADER Here, it's beginning to dawn on Trish how important she actually is to Paul and when initiator inquirer process works well again it pushes each person into new emotional places, places that they haven't been able to go on their own. And we're providing protection, so that they don't have to use their normal coping mechanism. The normal self-protections that they typically use to stay away from recognizing something like this. In Trish's case, usually because when Paul is triggered, she moves so quickly into defending her children that she never hears or never lets it in that she matters to him and that he cares a lot about the connection and the quality of the connection with her. But she's so busy protecting herself and defending the children that, that message never gets in. 

03:29:20
TRISH And then obviously things that either I do or my kids do that makes you feel alone in the world and left out. 

03:29:30
[sil.] 

03:29:35
PAUL I think that's, yeah. 

03:29:40
[sil.] 

03:29:45
ELLYN BADER She heard you pretty well. 

03:29:45
PAUL Yeah, umm… yeah. 

03:29:50
ELLYN BADER I mean, if there is more, I want her to be able to ask you so more but if there is more that you want to be sure to say to her. 

03:30:00
PAUL You know, I think, that, that people give signals, the hard part for me is that umm… the way I interpret it and I've done all these right or the best way or whatever is that, then people umm… are interpreting the signals they get from you umm… which is part of your expression about how you feel about me, which makes me feel that your commitment to me isn't a 100%. 

03:30:30
ELLYN BADER Paul is really struggling because he recognizes that their commitment isn't solid. It's not secure for him and with his history, it's very, very important to him that he feels that they have a secure attachment. 

03:30:50
PAUL And umm… and then uh… that makes me unsure about ultimately what we are. 

03:31:05
TRISH And it also sounds like, it makes you feel alone and not being connected. 

03:31:10
PAUL Yeah, I mean it makes, yeah. 

03:31:10
TRISH And it's kind of feels sad, lonely and… 

03:31:15
PAUL Yeah, I mean but, but I don't use sour words so much, okay, so… 

03:31:25
ELLYN BADER When Trish, when he started, he talked a little bit about feeling lost in those moments of disconnection. Can you just ask him to tell you a little bit more about his feeling lost? 

03:31:40
TRISH Is it, you know, how did that feel, how did that feel, lost? 

03:31:45
[sil.] 

03:31:50
PAUL Well, you know, well, then it just feels like I'm in a, umm… uh… you know, I'm just in a spot as the world is spinning and I could be any where else and it wouldn't make a difference. 

03:32:05
TRISH Alone? 

03:32:05
PAUL Alone, put me any place in the world and I'd just be in the same state, so, Put me here and I'll be here. 

03:32:15
TRISH Very alone, not connected to anyone. 

03:32:15
PAUL Yeah and I can just go and sure I can talk to people and you know, and, you know. 

03:32:25
TRISH No, no one cares about you. 

03:32:25
PAUL Yeah and what's it's gonna be ultimately, right so. Right, what's the deepest connection and what's the real connection and why we are here and connecting with everyone is wonderful to, to but you know, there is, there is a core to it and we have the core then you know, you just float above that level and you know connecting humanity which has got its own value but it's not, it doesn't feel the same. And it doesn't feel and it actually makes the connection to humanity less. 

03:33:05
[sil.] 

03:33:10
PETER PEARSON The feeling of being alone and lost. Does that go back to like, your family of origin where you would perhaps, a part of you feel alone and lost? 

03:33:20
PAUL I felt like a total free-standing, self-sufficient individual in the house and that umm… who actually had a responsibility to myself, to try to make it uh… a better situation for everyone not to make it better for them but simply make it better for me. There is just kind of you know, negotiating away in the world and that, you know, that alone is something I don't enjoy. So when other people are being weird about whatever they feel and I'm sensing it and it's like well, you know, could somebody say something or what does somebody really want or, you know, and it's all, you know the floating tension and uh… I feel in that situation again which is, okay, how, how much do I have to take care of myself and how much do I take care of people around me so that I can take care of myself. 

03:34:20
[sil.] 

03:34:25
PAUL And it's not a good feeling because when you're a kid growing up, it sucks. 

03:34:35
TRISH Yeah, I mean so often, I, when I hear these stories, I cant let… 

03:34:40
PETER PEARSON When I listen to you, right now, right now here is what's standing out for me is that I listen to you. 

03:34:45
TRISH Here is what's standing out for me when I listen to you, it's just, I mean, it just breaks my heart when I think of you as a little boy and I, I know what if it could be my kids and how I feel and my parents love and I feel that you never had that and it just, it's so sad. I just want to hug you and feel and give you back the childhood that you didn't have that I think you deserved and how you, you know must have felt and a lot of those feelings I'm hearing them out and I'm contributing to making you feel them again and that, and that makes me sad beside, you know, I don't want you to feel alone and I want you to feel loved and umm… 

03:35:30
ELLYN BADER Here Trish is really beginning to recognize the connection between the past and the present and how she is triggering pain from Paul's past in the present right now between the two of them. 

03:35:50
PAUL So one way, I would feel loved is that you respect me enough to umm… you know, tell me how you feel. 

03:36:00
PETER PEARSON tell her that, say that again to her Paul, what you just said. Say it again so it sinks into different regions of the brain. 

03:36:05
PAUL What I really appreciate is that if you could accept and actually respect me enough to tell me how you really feel about things, whatever they are so that we can umm… then there is no wondering and we can umm… you know, figure it out and make it work and… 

03:36:25
ELLYN BADER Well, when she tells you like that, you don't feel alone because she's… 

03:36:30
PAUL Yeah, because you're actually trusting me with your real feelings and so umm… uh… and that makes me feel, it actually umm… uh… validates for me umm… your trust in me and that umm… you know that I would never, I only do get things with your feelings or your desires. 

03:36:55
PETER PEARSON Now, this is gonna sound strange but what you're saying Paul is so important. I'm gonna ask you to repeat it again so it. Yeah, so I mean, it really is important that it reaches different regions of the brain. Not only as Trish hears it but as you express it yourself. 

03:37:10
PAUL Yeah. 

03:37:15
PETER PEARSON Very often, when one or the other partner says something that's very insightful or plangent or self-defining, I will say to them say that again, so that it just sinks into other regions of your brain which will make it easier for you to remember and it also helps your partner to incorporate it at other levels. So let's just say again what you said and then they say it the second time and almost always the second time, they say it, there will be a nuance or something slightly different or slightly amplified over the first time they said it. And then I will say, oh, what the heck, let's say it a third time, so that it really, really gets uh… embedded in your brain and your partner's brain so they can remember more easily what you have been saying and the third time they say it, they will add another nuance or another flavor or an additional perspective. So that it sinks in even deeper. 

03:38:20
ELLYN BADER You know, so early when we were talking, I said, I got, you know, it's easy for me to trust right because umm… I'll, I'll give myself and feelings and stuff to you so that you can, you know, and I trust you and if it turns out that my trust was misplaced well then, that's okay umm… you know I'll figure something out later right but umm… when you, if you did the same for me then I could, then I would feel umm… you know, that you actually uh… trusted me more than anybody else and that, that's a gift that you could give me. That's better than anything else you could give me so. 

03:39:05
PETER PEARSON Wow. 

03:39:10
ELLYN BADER It's pretty big. 

03:39:10
ELLYN BADER It's a gift, it's a gift. 

03:39:10
PETER PEARSON When you talk to Trish about the gift she can give you by being so clear. Will you tell her what that, what you feel right now as you express that desire, that wish? 

03:39:20
PAUL That's you and me against the world, right. So nobody else would know our, our most intimate thoughts or feelings and whatever those challenges and. 

03:39:35
ELLYN BADER But when you tell her what you feel when you say to her, how much that would mean to you. 

03:39:35
PETER PEARSON It's a gift. 

03:39:40
PAUL Oh, it's the, it's the bedrock, it's, it's the safe place in the world. 

03:39:45
PETER PEARSON And you feel what when you describe that safe place to Trish, you feel what? 

03:39:50
PAUL Well, then I feel umm… loved. 

03:39:55
[sil.] 

03:40:00
TRISH So I heard is that when, I can share my thoughts and feelings with you and more open with you and I respect you, I care about you, I'm connected to you. You feel loved. 

03:40:10
PAUL Trusted. 

03:40:15
TRISH Trusted, it's the ultimate gift that I can give you, us and how important that is and when I don't do that, all those things are affected. 

03:40:25
PAUL And what is kind of funny because you're trying to give me something by trying to figure out what I want and give me, you know, umm… a more superficial thing right versus the real thing which is telling me how you feel and, and then it's something that we can hold dear and it's something that we can make happen, it's something we can support and it's something we can do, so which is the connection and the love and the trust all together. 

03:40:55
ELLYN BADER Paul really wants Trish to move beyond her normal self-protective coping mechanisms. Paul would like Trish to share more of her real self with him is actually counter intuitive to Trish. It's hard for Trish to recognize that when she's direct, when she's honest, when she comes forward, that this makes things safer for Paul, that Paul really does want to know what she thinks, what she feels and what she desires. And when she says what she thinks, feels and desires, it makes it much safer for Paul. 

03:41:40
PETER PEARSON When Trish says. 

03:41:45
[sil.] 

03:41:50
ELLYN BADER It's her way of saying, he's not gonna leave you swimming out there alone. 

03:41:55
PAUL Yeah. 

03:42:00
ELLYN BADER And it's her way of saying, he's not gonna leave you swimming out there alone. 

03:42:00
PAUL Yeah, I mean, we're, we're in the puddle together. 

03:42:05
PETER PEARSON And you're not lost. Well, well, if you are lost, you are lost with a nice companion. 

03:42:15
PAUL Yeah, but then I'm not in Albania or any place else. I'm here, yeah, right. 

03:42:20
TRISH That's what you say, you and me against the world. 

03:42:25
[sil.] 

03:42:30
TRISH Thank you for sharing that. Really felt it. 

03:42:35
PAUL Me too. 

03:42:40
[sil.] 

03:42:50
TRISH I think what's so interesting, I mean, this is really profound but what, what he needs and wants is something that's so hard for me to do. It's, you know… 

03:43:00
ELLYN BADER That's why you found each other. 

03:43:00
TRISH It's a hallmark. 

03:43:05
PETER PEARSON How about this. What used to be so hard for you to do, we'll just put a little spin on that for right now. 

03:43:10
TRISH Okay. 

03:43:10
PETER PEARSON What used to be so hard for you to do because maybe… you're not done in here today yet. 

03:43:20
[sil.] 

03:43:25
TRISH It used to be so hard for me in the past, it's been hard for me today. 

03:43:25
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

03:43:30
ELLYN BADER So Trish and Paul were able to really reach a moment of empathic emotional connection. One this exercise works well, couples will be able to experience that with each other. Now there are many couples particularly angry hostile fighting couples where in the early times, that you use this exercise with them, they won't be able to get there and in fact, you don't want to set it up as a failure experience. So you might only focus on asking questions rather than asking them to go for the empathy. But the important thing to remember is that each role in its own way pushes development. The initiator role pushes the development of self-differentiation. It pushes can I figure out what I think, can I figure out what I feel, can I figure out what I desire and can I come forward and articulate it. The inquirer role pushes the capacities for other differentiation, the capacities to be genuinely curious, genuinely interested in my partner. Be able to extend myself toward them especially to be able to extend myself toward them when they are experiencing some type of emotional pain often they may have been triggered by me. And so the inquirer role really helps people learn how to not take things personally and be able to much more effectively give to their partners. When I think you're hearing more today about how much that matters to Paul. 

03:45:20
TRISH Yeah, I think it's the first time I've really heard that. First time you've really said that. 

03:45:25
PAUL In a way that you could hear for sure. 

03:45:25
TRISH Yeah, and then I've always felt that, you know, you felt alone, sometimes with what goes on with me and my family, kids whatever but never umm… how important sharing myself with you makes you validated and connected and loved. And that's the greatest gift I can give you. I've never really, you know, felt that till now. So thank you for sharing that. 

03:45:45
PAUL You are welcome 

03:45:50
[sil.] 

03:45:55
ELLYN BADER Paul is there anything else, you want to be sure today before we shift gears. I thought so. 

03:46:00
PAUL Umm… the reason, I work hard sometimes to get accepted or get used to it is because umm… uh… when we broke up, I was struggling with stress or whether or not it was something that I would accept the challenge on and umm… you know, be willing to find an okay place, uh… feeling uh… not umm… fully connected because, I just think you're such a wonderful person. So, I have to weigh the fact that there is that the risk of me living like this umm… was worth that to be with you. 

03:46:45
TRISH And you feel connected in that way. 

03:46:45
PAUL That connection would be intermittent or umm… inconsistent or umm… incomplete. 

03:46:55
TRISH That you're feeling alone and isolated and not together connected. 

03:47:00
PAUL Yeah, this thing that I just expressed that umm… that, that's what I went off uh… when we broke up to evaluate whether or not it was worth the risk for me to live like that. 

03:47:15
PETER PEARSON Pretty profound. Trish, pretty profound. 

03:47:20
TRISH Wow, yeah, I just thought you want to find someone better and was on looking for someone better. Well, you know, well, I didn't know that. You never shared that with me. 

03:47:35
PAUL No. 

03:47:35
TRISH So, you're feeling that way, you even began… 

03:47:35
PAUL Yeah, I mean, you know, you can see it, right. Like these people coming here. 

03:47:40
TRISH Yeah. 

03:47:45
ELLYN BADER He was smart enough to know that you and your kids were a tight package. 

03:47:50
TRISH Yeah. So your fears and concerns you had to weigh between, you know, and it sound like. 

03:47:55
PAUL All the good things we have versus living with this and that's what I chose. 

03:48:00
TRISH And, and they've continued and it sounds like these issues have continued, it must have been hard that you made a decision to commitment yet all your fears and concerns about these feelings have continued in our relationship. 

03:48:10
PAUL I valued all the positive things more. 

03:48:15
TRISH Thank you. 

03:48:20
PAUL It is my own thing, you know, I don't want people to change that much for me, right. 

03:48:25
ELLYN BADER You haven't actually been asking her to change, what you've been asking her to do is share more who she is. 

03:48:30
PAUL Yeah. 

03:48:35
ELLYN BADER And that when she does, you actually feel more connected and less alone. 

03:48:40
PAUL Yeah. 

03:48:40
ELLYN BADER And I think that you have thought that it's about how much time you spend together or how much the family is together and all of that. But he really wants to know you. He wants to know what I would hope you could take away from what you did today is Paul once you really decided to go ahead and be an initiator, you went with it and you really opened yourself up. And you were honest about feeling not easy anymore honest. And you really, and you really did worked to hear, to listen, to ask him more and to give him the space to tell you about it umm… and even though you felt I think like you would like to take away what he was feeling or you would like to make it go away, you sat with it and you stayed with it. And those are skills that each of you can build on and do more with it, that will be really valuable long term. 

03:49:45
Working with Trish's Internal Conflict 

03:49:45
PETER PEARSON So part of your struggle is there is a part of you that wants to do what Paul wants you to do, is to be more clear. The benefits in doing that would be what? 

03:49:55
TRISH Well, I think, the benefits to Paul in our relationship was that, he would feel you know, trusted and, and respected and loved and cared for and really more connected and that's the primary thing I heard from him. 

03:50:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, the benefits to you. 

03:50:10
TRISH For me, I think would be umm… something I've struggled with. I didn't even be clear on what I'm feeling now. I'd have to really be figure it out with someone as they don't take the time to do that and I would get to know myself better and share myself. 

03:50:30
PETER PEARSON However, you have an alter ego. 

03:50:30
TRISH I do. 

03:50:30
PETER PEARSON We need to hear from the alter ego. So come over here and sit here, and… you're the alter ego that says, well, that sounds really good, it sounds noble, it sounds positive, it sounds connecting. However, and this is the yes but form over here and from over here you would say what to her. 

03:50:55
TRISH Growing up, you know, didn't work, just better do, you know, keep your mouth shut and… 

03:51:00
PETER PEARSON Keep my mouth shut. I knew, it's better to keep my mouth shut. 

03:51:00
TRISH Keep my mouth shut and… 

03:51:00
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

03:51:05
TRISH You know, my role has always been the peacemaker so just you know, don't want to rock the boat. There is already enough tension and stuff going on in my family that you just still want to. 

03:51:15
PETER PEARSON I didn't want to add to it. 

03:51:15
TRISH I didn't want to add to it and I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut and you know, and I'm worried about what, you know, this person is saying that, that person is saying and all these other people and what's going on so, you know, what I think, I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut. 

03:51:30
PETER PEARSON I'll just keep my mouth shut. Yup and then hope for the best. 

03:51:35
TRISH Yes, yeah, I'll be safer, I'll gonna be a lot safer if I keep my mouth shut. Yeah, specially with my family. 

03:51:40
PETER PEARSON with especially with my family, keep my mouth shut. That's the marching orders of the day. That's great. Now, come over here and what would you say back to her? 

03:51:50
TRISH Well, how well is that working with you? 

03:51:55
[sil.] 

03:52:00
PETER PEARSON She might say, we're growing up, it was the best solution I had. So growing up, yeah, it was the best. 

03:52:05
TRISH That's true. 

03:52:05
PETER PEARSON That's true. 

03:52:05
TRISH I survived. 

03:52:05
PETER PEARSON What would you like to say to her? 

03:52:10
TRISH Umm… well, you paid a big price for that. 

03:52:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

03:52:10
TRISH In your life. 

03:52:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

03:52:15
TRISH Not knowing what you want, not getting what you want, umm… being resentful and angry later because you didn't get what you want but because you didn't even ask for it. 

03:52:25
PETER PEARSON Right. So you spared yourself a lot of disappointment by not speaking up and being disappointed. So in that sense, it was kind of a solution. 

03:52:30
TRISH It worked for a while. 

03:52:35
PETER PEARSON For a while, yeah, great, come back over here. This is good. From over here now, that however, what would you say back? 

03:52:40
TRISH I've worked for all these years, so I just keep, keep doing it and certainly the easier way out and getting involved in all these umm… discussions and arguments and umm… and you don't get your voice heard and need to meet anyway, so why bother? 

03:53:00
PETER PEARSON Yeah, it's a simpler way out. I don't know, if there would be an easier way because of, you know, you're willing to pay a price today but you're paying a bigger price tomorrow and the day after. But for today, in the immediate situation. 

03:53:15
TRISH It did seem easier. 

03:53:15
PETER PEARSON It seems easier or simpler. 

03:53:15
TRISH Simpler. 

03:53:20
PETER PEARSON So from the resistant chair, I just call that the resistant alter ego. From the resistant chair I have her say, I instead of you so that she claims the identity for herself in this chair. And it really doesn't make any difference. Some people look at the empty chair when they're talking, sometimes they look at me either as okay. Uh… some people just feel too uncomfortable talking to an empty chair, so they talk to me and I and that's, that's cool. Uh… but the important thing is to claim the voice for the chair that they are in and what's really great is that, it's kind of counter intuitive because I can totally support and even embellish why she wouldn't want to change and that's what makes this process help the individual, the client feel like they are totally supported and empathized with by me because I can support both sides with equal enthusiasm. 

03:54:20
ELLYN BADER And safer, safer, right. A lot safer just to keep my mouth shut and not risk wading into that potential conflict territory. 

03:54:30
PETER PEARSON You might say to her look, you got all those reasons but frankly, I prefer a little security and safety. Would that be fair? 

03:54:40
TRISH Yeah. 

03:54:40
PETER PEARSON All right. 

03:54:40
TRISH And I'm comfortable with it. I've done it that way all my life. You don't know what you're getting into. 

03:54:50
PETER PEARSON Listen. I understand the rules and regulations and schematics from over here and you want to upset my equanimity. 

03:54:55
TRISH Onto 60 years of this. 

03:55:00
PETER PEARSON Yeah, because, you wanna do, what? When you have the two alter egos talking to each other and you are hearing from the resistant part it's, I, I almost always look for what is the positive intention, how is that resistant part trying to be self-protective, trying to safe uh… from actual or perceived risk. The resistant part always has a positive intent and so it's important for you the therapist to help illuminate that positive intent so the part that wants to change can recognize that yeah, there really is a positive intention behind not doing what I want to do instead of saying, I just want to get rid of that part of me that resistant. I just want to go away, I want to tamp it down, I want to beat it down, I want to make it disappear. No, appreciate the intention of the resistant alter ego. It makes the collaboration come together much more naturally and organically down the road. So come back over here. She's fighting for her safety. What would you say to her? 

03:56:15
TRISH I want to say, umm… You know, you've done this for a long time that you paid a big price for it and it has always gotten you what you want. It hasn't always worked and it's not very satisfying or fulfilling. 

03:56:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah, ultimately, it's not very satisfying. 

03:56:30
TRISH Ultimately, it's not very satisfying or fulfilling and you feel like your needs aren't being met and you know, you're getting older in life as you know, who knows how much longer you have but it's this way, you really want to live your life. 

03:56:45
PETER PEARSON All growth requires a temporary surrender of our security. 

03:56:50
TRISH That's a good one. 

03:56:50
PETER PEARSON You agree with that from over there? 

03:56:55
TRISH All right. I do. 

03:56:55
PETER PEARSON That growth requires a temporary surrender of our security and safety. 

03:57:00
TRISH Definitely with that. 

03:57:00
PETER PEARSON That sounds good to you over here. All right, come back over here. What would you say back to her? 

03:57:10
TRISH Well, I'd say, go ahead and take your chances, if that's what you want to do. 

03:57:15
PETER PEARSON What's with attitude. Go ahead and take your chances. 

03:57:15
TRISH Go forward and see. 

03:57:20
PETER PEARSON Now, here is what's great about what I hear you saying is that you're willing to experiment. That's what from over here and that's crucial that you're willing to experiment from over here so you don't feel like you're gonna have to be, maybe stuck in this forever experimenting and you can always go back to the way it was. I want you to hear that from this side. You can always go back to the way it was. Two things, one is when asking for a change uh… use the term experiment. Are you willing to experiment over here so you don't believe, you're gonna be stuck in this forever. Too often when a therapist or the partner asks for a change from the other person, there is kind of an implication that once you make the change, it's gonna be forever. So people tend to resist the possibility of having to make a forever change. By saying, it's an experiment and you can always go back to the old way of being, freeze the person up to try something different for a while and just going back for a moment, about the self-protection where Ellyn commented that you want to feel safe. It's so important to underline and reinforce that kind of desire when Trish say, yeah, I wanted to feel safe, I didn't want to risk putting myself out there and being painfully disappointed yet again. And you can say, it makes so much sense that you would take safety first as a way of being from this side over here. And you're beginning to realize the limitations of a safety first approach. 

03:59:05
[sil.] 

03:59:10
PETER PEARSON Take a relaxing breath and let that in. You can always go back to the way it was. 

03:59:15
TRISH I can always go back to the way it was, if it doesn't work. 

03:59:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah, if it doesn't work. Come back over here please for a second. What do you appreciate about what she brings to the table? 

03:59:25
TRISH I appreciate that you umm… just help me adapt to life growing up and then my family and, and try to protect me and make it safe and maybe easier for me and it's a way that I kind of got through life and my family. 

03:59:40
PETER PEARSON And that's really important that you also appreciate it from that perspective as well. This is what got her through. 

03:59:50
TRISH Right, and if you, you're my family, what you do, I had to do that. 

03:59:55
PAUL Yeah. 

03:59:55
PETER PEARSON And see what you're bringing to the table is basically you're saying to her, maybe it's time to update your coping mechanisms because the family that I am creating now is different than the family where you made this decisions. Would that be fair? 

04:00:15
TRISH Totally fair. Very different. 

04:00:15
PETER PEARSON Could you say something like that to her? 

04:00:20
TRISH Yeah, I could say, you know, I don't really need you anymore. I've survived my family of origin and I'm in a new family but doesn't behave in the same way. 

04:00:25
PETER PEARSON I might modify a bit. Instead of saying, I don't need you anymore, because I think she still is important because she helps you be aware what other people feel. 

04:00:35
TRISH I don't want to lose that, yes. 

04:00:35
PETER PEARSON Yeah, that's what I mean. So it's not like you want to just totally discard her, I think she has so many important dimensions that she brings to the relationship that you can appreciate. 

04:00:50
TRISH So I think that I would now like to say, thank you for helping me in, in umm… navigating my childhood, my youth with my family and you help me get through sometimes and I appreciate that and but I also appreciate now that you are willing to try something different and see where how it works and that I don't have to hold onto the old ways of speak that's what I needed. 

04:01:15
PETER PEARSON Yeah, and still maintain some of that sensitivity to others. 

04:01:15
TRISH Yes, I want to continue to maintain that. 

04:01:20
PETER PEARSON Yeah, come over here and what would you say back to her. Trying to get the two alter egos to collaborate, be corporative and supportive of each other. I find it really useful to have both sides express appreciation for the intention for what the other person, the alter ego is attempting to do. And literally say yeah, I appreciate what you've been trying to do to take care of me, to protect me. I really appreciate that. However, I want to go beyond, so that both sides can feel validated, not just from me but from internally that they can validate each other. The validation then becomes much stronger. 

04:02:05
TRISH Thank you for acknowledging what I did for you, you're not totally throwing me away. 

04:02:10
PETER PEARSON Totally, totally. 

04:02:15
TRISH Umm… appreciating the, the parts that I, I helped you with whether it's being sensitive to the people around me and caring about them. 

04:02:20
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. 

04:02:25
TRISH I want to continue to have that in my life but umm… 

04:02:30
PETER PEARSON What, what do you feel when you say, it's, I'm glad to know that you still want me to be part of your life? What's that like when you say that? 

04:02:35
TRISH Umm… it feels like accepted uh… heard, not rejected yeah, and that was important part of me. 

04:02:45
PETER PEARSON And you're giving her a gift of willingness to experiment that you can support for a while. 

04:02:50
TRISH Yeah. 

04:02:55
PETER PEARSON What a gift, what a gift. 

04:02:55
TRISH Yeah. 

04:03:00
PETER PEARSON What do you feel when you say this? 

04:03:05
TRISH I feel very lucky that I've had this support and that we can work it out and try something different together. 

04:03:10
PETER PEARSON Together, together. 

04:03:10
TRISH Together. 

04:03:10
PETER PEARSON I like the acronym for team. TEAM, Together each accomplishes more, within you and between you. At this point, I want to help Trish remember what to do under pressure so that when the time comes up when she has to start saying something to Paul about identifying what's important about being more self-differentiated, I would like to give Trish a way of remembering and a short hand way, the process that we are going through, so that it's not a uh… so that it will make it easier for her to remember when she's under pressure. So I want to give her a strategy, a technique or a tool for how to think more clearly under pressure and how Trish and Paul can work together as a team to help bring forth this part of Trish to be more self-defined. Now go over here. Think of a word, an image or a phrase that you think might capture, the collaboration between these two parts. 

04:04:35
TRISH I don't know. I think the first thing that comes to me is acceptance. 

04:04:40
PETER PEARSON Acceptance, so here is what I'd like you to do. When you and Paul are discussing something and there is something you would like that's important to you but this part shows up just out of the condition reflex. Take a deep breath and go, acceptance. 

04:04:55
[sil.] 

04:05:00
PETER PEARSON Acceptance and it will bring back that term acceptance. We'll bring back by association what you've done in here today which then allows you to take the risk, to step forward and say, this is what I would like, I think. Acceptance so, it doesn't have to be fully formed in order for you to speak up. But often in the process of talking about something, it starts to become clearer to us. So I don't want you to think, it's gotta be totally clear ahead of time. Does that make sense? 

04:05:30
TRISH Yeah and actually that's good because I think a lot of times I'm not even clear and I just don't say anything. It's you know and other people much quick to get to… 

04:05:40
ELLYN BADER That's why it matters so much for Paul to ask you a lot of questions and really show that interest. 

04:05:45
PETER PEARSON Here is where you guys can work together. The two of you are talking and you say something and you go. I think there is something in here that's important to me and you say to Paul, acceptance and now here is how you guys work as a team. You say, Paul acceptance. That's your cue to ask questions. 

04:06:05
PAUL Okay. 

04:06:05
PETER PEARSON That's your cue to say, all right, there is something you want to say, right. There is something important floating around. Is that right and you go, yeah Paul, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is yet but it's floating out there, it's orbiting. Now I want reel it in and say what it is and you say, great take your time, just make some speculations, that's okay. And then you are working on your best behalf to help her get clear as well and now you guys are really working as a team to get through this. Is that cool or what? 

04:06:40
PAUL Yeah. 

04:06:40
TRISH That's great, it's amazing. 

04:06:40
PAUL Yeah. 

04:06:40
TRISH Yeah. 

04:06:40
PAUL I like it. 

04:06:45
PETER PEARSON All right. 

04:06:45
ELLYN BADER Can you say to Paul if this feels true and getting close to you and creating a family with you doesn't mean I'm recreating my family of origin.

TRISH I like that. Often, I feel like I had to. I'm getting close to you, it does not make me feel I have to recreate my family of origin. 

04:07:15
PAUL Good. 

04:07:15
ELLYN BADER Or that I am recreating. 

04:07:15
TRISH Or that I am recreating, yeah that I am recreating my family of origin. 

04:07:20
PETER PEARSON Now, take a big relaxing breath and tell him one more time, so that it sinks even deeper. 

04:07:25
TRISH Getting close to you does not mean that I am recreating my family of origin or have to recreate my family of origin. 

04:07:35
PETER PEARSON We will create our own family. 

04:07:40
TRISH We will create our own family, you and me. 

04:07:40
PAUL Both together. 

04:07:45
PETER PEARSON Together each accomplishes more. 

04:07:45

ELLYN BADER This concludes our work in session one and session two with Trish and Paul and I have to say how much I appreciate both of them for their willingness to share their personal struggles with Pete and with me and with all of you and they were really a couple of that were willing to get in there and take advantage of the opportunity that, the opportunity that they had to work with us and they really went with what we threw at them, they went with the paper exercise, they went with the initiator, inquirer. Trish went beautifully into the two chair work with Pete and they enabled us to create something special to show you how each of these processes in their own way can be very impact full with a couple that is ready to grow, that is ready to develop, they're ready to make a difference in their lives. 

04:08:55
PETER PEARSON They were really very satisfying to work with because of their willingness to be coached and what we did in the first two sessions actually can set the stage for deeper work on more specific issues uh… for future sessions with them but even though they were willing to be coached, the same principles apply for the couples that you're going to have show up in your office, starting a session by saying, tell me what your partner's major complaints about you are. Unless, they are coming in for an emergency initial session, it's a good way to start. You can also use that same approach with your current couples, simply by changing the language a little bit and say, to a couple that you're working with right now as things now stand, let's just do a review about how well you guys have been listening to each other. So Sue, what do you think bob's major complaints about you are up to this point? Bob what do you think Sue's major complaints about you are up to this point and it's a way of getting refocused and on track again in a non-blameful way. You can use the paper exercise with any of your couples at any point in your therapy. Let's just do a diagnostic experiment here for a moment and then introduce the paper exercise. Anytime, at any point with new couples or current couples or individuals, when you have helped them identify a goal of how they aspire to be, then you can start looking for the alter ego that is going to resist that kind of goal in going to two chair work, so even though, Paul and Trish were really coachable, you can use the same concepts with people who are not so coachable to help smooth the whole process of couple's therapy.

ELLYN BADER Pete and I really were able to stay descriptive and not judgmental with them. And I think that enabled each of them even though they had very awful things in their own families of origin, it enabled them to feel safe to take some of the next steps and take some risks in going into areas they had not gone into before.
