THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is politics and spirituality. With me is Ram Dass, a noted spiritual teacher and author of many books, including Be Here Now, Grist for the Mill, Miracle of Love, Gradual of Awakening, The Psychedelic Experience, and most recently, How Can I Help? During the past decade Ram Dass has been active in social causes, including the Prison-Ashram Project, curing blindness in Nepal and India, working with refugees in Guatemala, and working with American-Indians on health issues. Welcome, Ram Dass. 

00:01:05
RAM DASS Thank you, Jeffrey. 

00:01:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be with you. You know, I think if we were to go right to the core of the issue, it strikes me that at the very bottom line, at the… at the root of things, the spiritual premise is that we are all one, and therefore politically we would want to treat the whole world as if it were our own body, in a sense. That would seem to me to be the… the basic premise of… of spirituality and politics. 

00:01:35
RAM DASS Seva Foundation Well, yes, but there are many levels to understand that. You can understand it with your intellect, and you can understand it because you are that, and that's a very different place to act politically. It's like Mahatma Gandhi said, "When you make yourself into zero, your power becomes invincible." Now, any politician, or anybody in… in the life of trying to institute social change in society, would like to have that power be invincible, but it only happens when you aren't, but it is. And that's the one that is really hard that you have to in a way die into "not my but thy(ph) will" for that kind of potential impact on social change. 

00:02:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think there's a paradox there, in a sense, because if… if we totally is sort of bow to the will of God, it might lead us to… to not want to resist the current situation. 

00:02:30
RAM DASS It's an incredibly interesting risk, and you've got to trust that when you have surrendered, you will hear clearly. The Tao says the truth waits for eyes unclouded by longing, and your longing to have it different than it is, is ultimately a trap, because it keeps you from hearing the whole gestalt, the whole way things are and as you hear the totality of it, you trust that out of that will come an appropriate action, a dharmic action and that's the trust of dharma, that's the trust in the wisdom of the universe that is greater than your own personal egoism. So there is certainly an exquisite risk in it. 

00:03:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh yeah. 

00:03:10
RAM DASS I mean you know you're… we're so used to working out of "I ought to do it, I should do it" getting behind ourselves and pushing. The whole idea of trusting, that if we didn't push something would still happen, is very interesting to explore in people. 

00:03:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, there must be a fine line between trusting and not pushing on the one hand, and on the other hand being really passionate about social change. 

00:03:35
RAM DASS But again it's where passion comes from. If passion comes out of what I call milking the drama, or comes out of identifying with the emotions, I think it's some short of what the possibility is. There is, for example, what's called dharmic anger, where a… a Zen monk will beat his student out of the incredible amount of love and compassion he has. I would say that if you… if you're deeply enough in love with the universe, then the passion that arises out of it is different than if you aren't, and I… I think the passion is a passion that comes out of joyful involvement in the universe. But I think it's the passion of a river or a tree; I don't think it has to be you know "Aah!" like although it could be. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well you seem to be suggesting that the quality of… of one's actions in… in a political-social arena, or any arena for that matter, is really determined by internal factors. In that would make it would seem to me, impossible to… to judge the actions of anyone else, even a Stalin or a Hitler. 

00:04:50
RAM DASS I think it's a pretty tricky business. I think that you can make judgments about actions that you don't judge beings, you judge their actions and actions are good or evil, in the sense that actions increase paranoia and separateness, or they increase unity. So you can judge actions and you can be opposed. I can say, "I don't… I don't… I don't agree with that action you're going to do, and in fact I'm going to stop you from doing the action," but as Kabir said, "Do what you do with another human being, but never put them out of your heart." That if I have to harden my heart in order to oppose you, I lost, we both lost. 

00:05:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:05:25
RAM DASS That's part of the art of the inner and the outer dialog. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, George Orwell in 1984 refers to brief Big Brother as the sort of. One gets the sense that… that the game is that he's this loving tyrant, or at least his people believe that… that all of the cruelties are done out of some kind of benevolence. It in it seems to me that… that there is a longing that people have for perhaps a benevolent tyrant who will come in and straighten things out for us. Dostoyevsky spoke about how people long to… to take their freedom and… and lay it at the feet of… of a benevolent church that might act in a tyrannical way. 

00:06:05
RAM DASS Yeah I… I think the deeper issue is whether the universe is benevolent or not, because we all see that when you invest in an institution or another person, you are investing external to your own deepest inner truth, and you've constantly got to be running that back against your inner truth. You can't just join a club and then say, "I surrender to the club." Like the whole misconception of a guru is that you surrender to a person. You… you only surrender to that which is the truth where God, guru, and self are one and the same thing, so when you surrender that way, you're surrendering that way at the same time. I could never imagine surrendering to something that would be… that would invalidate my intuitive wisdom, and as long as you keep connecting to that, but that the question of whether or not then you know that you don't have to judge whether it's benevolent or malevolent, you just judge, "Is this harmonious with my inner being?" I don't have to judge you, I just have to keep my own game on a straight path. The question of whether the universe is benevolent or not, that's an interesting one. I because I have a sense I was talking with Jerry Brown, who used to Governor here in California and we were talking about that issue, of whether you have to assume a benevolent universe in order to trust deeply enough to surrender and we both could hear the lawfulness of the universe, and I would say that there is an evolutionary thrust that's not a Darwinian kind, it's much more of a consciousness evolution or I mean at the kind of metaphor I play with is the one manifest as the many returning to the one, or something like that. So there's directionality, and in that sense it has values connected with it, but I don't think you'd call that either benevolent or malevolent. Any one you wouldn't call a clock benevolent or malevolent… malevolent because it's going forward instead of backwards. 

00:08:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I know it's a… it's a deep philosophical issue. There's a strong trend amongst existentialists, and amongst behaviorists and… and atheists and… and left-wing political people, to suggest that the universe is fundamentally indifferent, and it's up to us to create our own reality, and… and I guess often people feel that it should be created from the intellect, from rationality. 

00:08:35
RAM DASS Well that's, I think giving us really short shrift, because to me the intellect is a kind of a is a very small system within a much larger context, and to deny the context in which the intellect functions is to leave one little segment of… of nature trying to subsume everything under it. It's a lot like the drunk looking for the watch under the street lamp, you know when he lost it up in the alley, but there's a light here and it's the sort of. What it also does is it makes the whole world objects. The intellect makes the world objects; you always think about things and that always puts you one thought away from where it is, so you're always an alien in your own universe when you… when you mediate everything through your intellect. So the fun is to have your intellect as Ramakrishna said, "It's a wonderful servant, but it's a lousy master," and I think that's probably true. 

00:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You spoke a little earlier about making political decisions and… and judgments in terms of how it fits, I think, with one's heart. 

00:09:45
RAM DASS Yeah. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it seems to me that its… 

00:09:45
RAM DASS Not heart, emotional heart, you know. Heart like Chinese hsin-hsin, or the Atman, meaning the deepest place of truth. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The core. 

00:09:55
RAM DASS The deepest intuitive place in one's being. 

00:10:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That… that would… that would seem that notion would seem to contradict what we see very much in the world about us now, which are religious-political movements you know, the Moral Majority, or Islamic fundamentalism, where in the name of a particular religious dogma, certain political planks are… are established, and everyone within that organization or within that tradition is expected to support a particular political attitude. 

00:10:30
RAM DASS When… when there is a lot of fear, there's a lot of uncertainty. When there's a lot of uncertainty, there is usually a lot of fear attendant to it and how people react to fear is interesting. Some people just consume more. They say, "I'll get it while I can, because it's all going to blow up anyway." They become more and more materialistic. Some people want… they want to be on the right side when the doors close, so they become fundamentalists in one sense or another. They grab onto right as opposed to evil. They want to be one of the 144,000 that gets in the door and the other group uses that the uncertainty as a way to deal with their inner relationship to uncertainty, and they go inward and ah you can see the society dealing with the fear that way, and so that real thrust to the kind of righteousness is staying at the plane of good and evil, is staying at the plane of polarities, and it's not seeing, as G. Manly Hall said, that "he who knows not that the Prince of Darkness is but the other face of the King of Light knows not me." that's the one if you. It's interesting that all these religions in our Western sense I mean Christianity and Judaism and Islam are really monotheistic. They believe in the one. Like (inaudible ) and yet, they always live within the two. It's like it's all one, it's… it's one except for me, or except for us, and so we end up mea culpa-ing ourselves, because it's chutzpah in exoteric Western religions to think that you are one with the one. We say it's all one, but we don't really act as if it were all one, which… which is much more like holography. 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No, we typically act as… as if we're very distinctly separate. 

00:12:25
RAM DASS Distinctly, distinctly, and we got the bad… we got the repaying know the end of the stick. 

00:12:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Original sin. 

00:12:30
RAM DASS Absolutely. Because we fell out of something and if you see it as the one exploring itself through us, I mean through this multiplicity of forms that are all part of the One, and that it goes into the dream or the illusion. Or the it gets entrapped in the separateness in order to awaken out of the separateness in order to see itself, and it's just a beautiful dance of this delicate form of the one at play. The whole thing lightens up a lot. 

00:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE yeah… yeah what I sense you saying is that you're making a clear distinction between spirituality and religion. 

00:13:10
RAM DASS Between institution that… that see, religions do provide exquisite practices to get deeper into the spirit. The problem is that every practice is entrapping. You… I don't care whether it's meditation or Catholicism or the Torah or drugs or whatever, yoga or whatever it is. They're all traps and the game of meth… method is that you've got to use the trap and risk being entrapped, with the expectation that it will self-destruct if it really works. The problem is, if it self-destructs the whole priest class is out of business, in institutional religion, so that the game has a funny kind of top, a false top on it, because it's a any institution that starts to have you know salaries and institutional structures and all that, immediately can't self-destruct. It doesn't It's not designed that way. 

00:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well you suggest in your most recent book, How Can I Help?, that through service one finds a path to… to realization, to God, or to enlightenment. I sense that in all religions there is this path of service, and that seems to come as close as religion really gets to political action. 

00:14:30
RAM DASS Yeah, but that… that… the difference is where you do the service from. There are an awful lot of religion… religious organizations that do service, but they do service like, "We'll help the poor." That's not exactly karma yoga, or the use of serving somebody to transcend the dualism between the server and the served. I'm talking about it as a very precise method of enlightenment of serving where there is no server, because the Bhagavad-Gita says, "Be not identified with being the actor, and be not attached to the fruits of the action." But still, you do it. Now, how do you help somebody where you're not attached to how it comes out, and you're not busy being the helper? That's the art form. Then you're just doing what you're doing because you're doing what you're doing. You are the help. You're not the helper, you're the help, and who's getting helped remains open to question. If you're not getting helped by being a helper, forget it. You must be standing in the wrong place. 

00:15:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems that the Bhagavad-Gita really puts the issue in its starkest form… 

00:15:30
RAM DASS Doesn't it ever. 

00:15:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …when you consider that what… what's being discussed here is warfare in fact, warfare against one's own family. 

00:15:40
RAM DASS Yeah well, that's an interesting one, of which level to take that at, because you also can take that metaphorically, of the warring between the ego and the higher self, and the whole internal battle. I mean, the fun of the Bhagavad-Gita… Bhagavad-Gita is that you can play with it at so many levels, like any good holy book. I mean any good holy book is a multi-leveled smorgasbord of possibilities of interpretation. 

00:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I have seen some very right-wing mercenary type people wearing T shirts with a slogan to the effect of, you know "Kill them all now and let God sort out the… the ones later." 

00:16:15
RAM DASS Wow. That's an extraordinary T shirt. 

00:16:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah you haven't heard that slogan. 

00:16:20
RAM DASS No, I haven't heard that one. 

00:16:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I mean it seems that some people take and its almost a religious or a spiritual attitude that they're going to do what they think they have to do, when… when if they kill people, God will figure out who goes to heaven and who goes to hell, and they're not to blame. 

00:16:40
RAM DASS Isn't that interesting? Well the fact that the I don't even know how to get hold of that one. Fact that there… that there I mean, the karma of an individual who will kill somebody because that individual feels they have the right way or the only way, already their mind has made another person to them. So what they're saying is they're going to kill all the them. There are two ways to kill the them. One is you go da… da…. da… with a machine gun, and the other is you extricate yourself from a world of us and them in your own mind, and you've killed all the them, and there's only us left. I was in Guatemala, and one of the women, these women widows whose husbands have been murdered before their eyes, one of these women said to… to me through a translator, "Thank you so much for leaving your home and family to come and help us." And I… I just opened to it and I said, "I didn't. You're my home and family." I mean, who's leaving what? And I felt the truth of that at the moment. She was defining it in terms of that she was them, but I didn't see her as them. She was us and that's part of the excitement of being willing to risk in service seeing the beloved in all the forms and seeing yourself in all the forms. Instead of averting your eyes from pain and suffering, turn around and embrace it into yourself, without being afraid you're going to be drowned by it, because you know you can say no without closing your heart. These are all a part of a piece, the beautiful services a yoga is. 

00:18:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah will you seem to be… if… if one carries your position to its logical extreme, it means being willing to look at… at the grossest, most hellish misery on the planet. 

00:18:30
RAM DASS All of it. 

00:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And embrace it. 

00:18:35
RAM DASS All of it, all of it. You look just directly at you learn how to keep your heart open in hell. You see the horrible beauty of the universe. I remember once I was teaching down at Big Sur, at Esalen, and they gave me a house to house-sit, and it came with a cat. The cat and I became buddies, and every day the cat would come in when I was meditating in the morning, and bring in its morning breakfast, which was a lizard or something, which was usually still alive and it would sit down between my legs to eat, to be with me. And I would be sitting there being with God, and I'd hear, "Squeak, squeak. Crunch, crunch," and I didn't know who to hate. I mean, I loved the cat, but suddenly the cat was a killer. And I loved the lizard, because I identified with you know, and I went through all the changes, and I saw it is the phenomena of nature. You've got to be able to look at it all and say, "Yes, I acknowledge it, I acknowledge it," without being so busy reacting to it that you don't because you don't even understand why it is that way. I mena my ability to see around the edge of, as Rilke said, the billboard at the edge of town, being able to see just around the edge of the veil and I can just see a teeny little bit, just like we all can leads me to understand the game is much farther out that I thought it was. That suffering has… I mean, I can understand the term, "Suffering is grace." I can't live it. I can live it at moments, with little sufferings. But I can understand that there is a beautiful unfolding of awareness through suffering. That's what my work with the dying is about. 

00:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah I remember once when I was a teenager I heard a rabbi talk about what… what he felt was the essence of Jewish ethics, and he said, "If I saw another man and he had no clothes, and all I had was a pair of pants, I would take my pair of pants off and give it to him." And it struck me that, well, that's very beautiful, it really is, but I don't live my life that way, and I don't know anyone else who does and yet I think I hear that coming from you that when we recognize the one as… as being ourselves, how… how can we not want to share our last pair of pants? 

00:20:50
RAM DASS I hear the question. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:00
RAM DASS See, it's a very delicate one. Simone Weil, a philosopher, she was a wealthy Belgian, I think, and then she was so… she wouldn't take any more than the poorest person in the world had, and the result was she starved to death, in her twenties I think. Now, there's something interesting in that story, and there's always also something that is poignant about it that you and I have a unique predicament, a karmic predicament, that we were born in this time in this place with these potentials, these opportunities. I'm not sure all people have the same game in life. I'm not sure that I have to be just like everybody else, so that there may be a way in which I'm… I don't know, I've got to listen carefully to hear; I'm not rationalizing having more than another human being. But I know, that if I have to send all like my guru said to me, "God comes to the hungry in the form of food." Now, if I am worrying about my survival every day, there's no way I can be… be here with you, and if I can't be here with you, all of us can't be sharing. 

00:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Nor could I be here with you. 

00:22:15
RAM DASS Exactly. So in a way, we are part of the microcosm of human consciousness. We have a part to play, which means we have to have the pants in order to play. So I'm not sure I would give away my pants at that level. I'd you know I'd explore it. I'd… I'd stay with the moment. See, I either would or I wouldn't, is sort of the way I'd deal with that. I don't try… I'm not trying to con out of it, but to deal with it. 

00:22:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it…. it's an issue. Maybe another way to look at it might be… 

00:22:40
RAM DASS And I don't think I'm a bad Jew for not giving away my last pair of pants, by the way. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, that's an extreme example, but how about, for example, building elaborate houses of worship cathedrals, synagogues, and… and churches? 

00:22:50
RAM DASS Well, you can look at those both ways. I mean, I wouldn't do it, but at the same moment I can see that for people in very poor countries that have very little mythic identity to give them joy, when they go into their cathedral, and they look up, and they worship and light incense, and there's the beautiful Christ, I can see that they get their lives enriched in a way that a lot of the regular daily stuff of their life doesn't do and you could say that the Church is milking it so that they're not getting an extra meal, but maybe it's feeding them in another way, which is its justification. I don't think it's a black-and-white issue in that way. 

00:23:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah it seems to me what you're expressing here is… is a willingness to accept reality as it is. 

00:23:45
RAM DASS That's a big one, isn't it? To accept our humanity and to accept that an institution could be serving, and it could be a corruption of what it was intended to do, and it's probably a little of both, and so are we, and we've got to deal with that. We've got to accept our own humanity first, and then and really accept it, not judge it so much. I've really shifted from being a judger of everything to being an appreciator of it to just appreciating how it is and it brings me to a much more intimate relationship. The judging mode is always distancing myself from everything, so I'm not even judging… judging now. 

00:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It would seem to me that you must be much more skillful as a social activist or as a political actor in any sense. If… if you're not judging people, that should mean to me that you could communicate with anybody. 

00:24:35
RAM DASS Well, in ideally, yes, and I've… that's what I'm working on. That's what I'm working on 7and what I'm doing is I'm going closer and closer to the fire all the time, because see it's very easy for me to stay in my own little bailiwick, around all of the people that are my yea-sayers, my constituency, and everything I say, they say, "Oh, Ram Dass, oh, that's great wisdom." It's quite different to mix it up with some social activists who say, "Ron who?" I mean, they don't know me from anything, and you've got to be there with the truth of your being in that situation and that to me is beginning to be exciting. For years I wouldn't do it, I wouldn't risk it. I said I can't I think Vivekananda once said, "Debates are for schoolchildren," and I thought, I will just represent what I represent, I'll do what I do, and the people that want to play will play, and the others will do what they do, and that's okay. I'm not judging them; we have different business. But now I see that we can maybe talk together, and that's going to be interesting. That's… that's really the 60's anti-Vietnam and the 60's spiritual turning inward, starting to find their way back together again, which I think is kind of interesting. 

00:25:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah it seems as we're moving into the 90's that we're at a point where all of the old definitions of who we thought we were are falling away, and… and we find ourselves dialoguing with people we didn't imagine we would. 

00:25:55
RAM DASS Yeah well, I mean how much more could that be than with the invention of the telephone, or the invention of the radio, or the invention of television, or air travel? or I take care of my father, and he's ninety. And he was born in 1898, and when I'm thinking about this as a time of great change, I think of what changes have occurred in that man's life. I mean he and I went on rides and saw the tracks that the horse and buggy that he went on made when he was a child. That he lived in that world and I realized the immense changes in our culture. Sometimes consciousness has gone along with it, and sometimes consciousness has just gotten more deeply entrapped in externalities in that's… that's what interests me not the evolution of technology, but the evolution of the way that technology allows the liberation of consciousness. 

00:26:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah well, people have always commented, so long as I can remember, that our inner growth hasn't kept up with technology, but… but perhaps we're seeing… 

00:26:55
RAM DASS I'm not sure about that. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …you perhaps we're seeing the evolution of inner growth. 

00:27:00
RAM DASS I mean, when you think of us living with the bomb. I mean I grew up at a time we didn't have a bomb. 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I'm going to have to cut you short now, though. Our time is out, Ram Dass. 

00:27:10
RAM DASS The bomb just came. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah thank you so much for being with me. 

00:27:15
RAM DASS Jeffrey, it's been a pleasure. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's been a pleasure for me too and thank you very much for being with us.

THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:28:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Back with Ram Dass and we are discussing politics and spirituality. Welcome again. 

00:28:10
RAM DASS Thank you Jeffrey. 

00:28:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We were talking about the threat of nuclear war and the fact that, perhaps the modern political conditions are creating a situation which is challenging the human spirit perhaps to rise to a newer level of… of wisdom and nobility. 

00:28:30
RAM DASS Yeah it's not quite a socially a hip things to say, but it might be the optimum conditions for… for growth of consciousness because having as don't wants us living with death on your left shoulder or over your left shoulder which is what's happening with the presence of the bomb and living with the, with threat of the fact that are greed may under ultimately destroy us by polarizing us so much all those things those are forcing a degree of awareness that's kind of interest. 

00:29:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And I would think that since the… the Holocaust of world war II we have also been confronted with the dark side of human nature in a… in a way that is difficult to deny. 

00:29:15
RAM DASS Yeah… yeah see that one you… you got to be careful when you go near it because to say, that the holocaust I mean the human hearts screams at the thought of holocaust. From another level the holocaust has forced us very clearly to confront and to awaken around the qualities of our humanity like when Buddha said, we are born with a five hindrances with lust in greed that's one that's not even two hatred nil, will, agitations slaughter interpret and doubt and that's when we start with then you are not surprised when you see all these stuff it's because we were busy denying this part of our humanity that we keep getting trapped in it and. 

00:30:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One… one of the darkest periods I think in… in human history would be the… the inquisition during the middle ages and that was the time when people were pointing at… at the devil outside of themselves and in the name of Christ and in the name of eradicating diabolic behavior I think some ten million people were… were tortured and murdered. 

00:30:25
RAM DASS Yeah the… the externalization of the dark side as you call it as of that is a familiar technique for not accepting personal responsibility if you are own humanity in each of us is as Freud pointed out are all the instinctual urges to that… that underlie killing and underlie rape and pillage and all those things. We also have other qualities and if you go deeper than that, you get behind all that or even although Freud didn't accept that possibility. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I am not convinced to myself that… that we are really any wiser as… as a race as… as a planet and… and we may have been in the past. I think we are confronted with a sort of do or die choice that… that we have to develop our wisdom or we may not survive but it… it I just don't know whether an act will be rising to that challenge. 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:25
RAM DASS I can really figure out which context to use to determine the answer to that, I mean because I am trained in Hinduism I have got these vast time games like, Yuga's and Cross fit which involve 400,000 year units and you know and this is known as the Kali yuga within and there is the satya yuga and all these differently and this is the time when you would expect things to be this way. 

00:31:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Great darkness. 

00:31:50
RAM DASS Great darkness and yet those are the con… the conditions which are optimum for the next thing which is the Satya Yuga and they all keep going in this rhythmic cycle and if you stand back far enough, if you stand back far enough nothing is happening at all that's an interesting place and that's equally as real as the question is do you think it's really changing what you think we are going end… 

00:32:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Its jut all molecules spinning around and it always has been. 

00:32:15
RAM DASS And even that all in time and space if you go behind time and space Hakuin, the Zen monk says, "Your coming and going is nowhere but the where you are." There is nothing happening… there is nothing I mean it's just the illusion of moment and the illusion of evolution and the illusion of reincarnation and so all dream stuff. 

00:32:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We know I… I like that notion I… we come back to it from time to time in the interviews and it dawns on me that there is something very, very profound in… in that idea it suggests to me that everything that I perceive is ultimately in… in my own sensory I mean perhaps as Bishop Berkeley put it in the mind of God that it gets one back to solipsism which is always struck me not as a trivial philosophy but is a very profound and rich philosophy. 

00:33:05
RAMM DASS Seva Foundation I… I am a… a student of Theravada in Buddhism and like a couple of years ago, I spent about two and half months in a monastery in Burma in Rangoon. Sitting in a cell watching the muscle in my abdomen rise and fall with each breath and every time it went up I noted rising and every time it went down I noted falling and I did that from three in the morning till eleven at night everyday for two months. It was about two months I guess while I got tired of that I could stand up and walk around the cell watching my feet lift, push place, lift, push, place and you're what you doing is you are bringing your awareness to one point and then that allows you to see the way in which the thoughts keep arising and your awareness keeps being grabbed by the thought and so you begin you… you keep identifying as the thinker instead of the awareness that lies behind thought and as you keep practicing this absurd game on and on and on your mind gets so quiet you begin to see the way in which your mind is creating your Universe and that is an awesome moment it really is because up until then it's been a kind of theoretical game that we are to we think we are, and suddenly you have just touched that place behind it well(ph) it's not the place you have… you have entered behind thought because even the concept of places are thought and… and in a way that's the great liberator because from then on you begin to see the way in which you see me as Ram Dass or is see you as Jeffrey is all the creation of mind I don't know what's out there I just know what my mind is creating of what's out there and its fun because you begin to be appreciate that you are living in your creation then you say, well why did I create you, you are my Karma and I am yours in that game and why did I create you and then when is thrown into the world of Karma of how is the whole sequence of causing an effect, how all my relations with people in blue jackets affecting how what I see it at this moment when I look at you and… and it gets quiet exquisite to keep getting behind your own thought to see the way you are doing it, it's like being a whole year of your own mind and you… you are beginning to learn how to rest in the place behind thought so that your mind is basically empty all the time you are not thinking at all and then thoughts rise up is there appropriate instead of always thinking all the time which is what most people are doing. Most people are thinking all the time. And when you get behind there, you begin to see other people's minds very clearly they come at you like these huge mind nets that are coming up saying, this is reality, this is reality, this is reality and this is who I am, this is who you are this is reality, this is why I am and they keep their mind at this thick things and you are walking in around all these mind nets are the peoples mind and you begin to feel that projective systems coming at you and you make yourself like a sieve and they pass through just like water and instead of being reactive to it. 

00:36:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How do you go from that space to all of the social activism which in which you have participated? 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:35
RAM DASS Well, the social activism I participated in is… is primarily the initial focus was that the, it was the leading edge of the way I could work on myself. See what I am aware of is that if I am going to relieve another human being suffering I have got to extricate myself from my own because if I am identified with that in me which suffers when I tried to help somebody else out, there is a funny way in which I am dig in the hole deeper for both of us that's a very scuttle for. Thomas Merton said, if you are going to help somebody that's… that's drowning in a river he never got a place to stand to get them, otherwise there is no sense in just jumping and in drowning with them and so, when I started working with dying people for example, I could see that the basic the first Chakra or the basic preoccupation of us as incarnates was survival and that the closest eye could come to that issue of survival the closest eye could confront that basic clinging or holding of fear so that being with dying people was the leading edge I could work with because if I could get to the point where I could be with death without flickering not through closing my heart staying right here wide open and still not flickering then I can say not for people because everybody is busy going death, death or death you know whatever they are doing about. So then… then I end up being somebody who is working with the dying and people say, oh! He is so good he is working with the dying but I am part of that circle which says, I work on myself in order to be in an environment for other people to come up for air if they want to and it turns out I don't really care which one I am doing I mean there is an infinite variety of suffering, there is suffering in the rich, there is suffering in the poor, there is suffering in developing countries, there is suffering in affluent countries, they are just suffering everywhere there is neurosis and there is hunger and there is everything violence and terrorism and when you stick your finger in the pyre if you sit around waiting what's the most important suffering I can deal with you just stay in your mind afraid of making a wrong choice it doesn't matter where you start, you can start in the Laundromat wall with a little sign and a blind person need somebody will read their mail or something it doesn't matter where you start you can start in the grocery store helping somebody with the bundles it doesn't matter because the minute you start that process the work on yourself starts and the work on your own heart and the work on the qualities of compassion and you get to watch all the fortunate ways you try to help somebody which is exquisite I mean you begin to see what a phony you are you know how you are milking it for and I good and you are going to live with all that stuff and it gets cleaner and cleaner as you just keep letting it go honoring, allowing and letting it go. It's a beautiful yoga. 

00:39:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I… I would think as you get involved with people in the world of social activism, there is, there is a tendency amongst people in that arena to… to feel that work on themselves is unimportant or may be even self-indulgent. 

00:39:45
RAM DASS That's more, its probably true yeah and I think that, I think the art is to have the way in which you work on yourself become so subtle that nobody notices it. So it's not like saying excuse me I can't demonstrate, I am busy working on myself it's not an either row of preposition I mean I want to be right there with the people doing the actions but I want to be doing them in such a way that its… it's Gandhi's line that great story, Gandhi was on a train. He was about to go into an area where the Hindus and the Muslims were dwelling each other and everybody thought this is going to be the what he is going to lose, he is going to get killed in this one, and a reporter was rushing along the platform of the station saying, Mahatmaji give me a message to take back to the people and Gandhi took a paper bag and he scribbled on it and he handed it out and said, My life is my message and I think of anything is my mantra if you will of social action it's my life is my message, its… it's that the way I wash dishes in a soup kitchen is… is much what I am, what I have to be about as the fact that I am busy saying well we have to wash dishes without getting angry or frustrated or anything, its am I getting angry and frustrated? And I think that the teaching turns out to be such a subtle one I am just learning that, I am learning, you don't come on you don't come on I know let me you are going to work on yourself one. It doesn't do that, you do it so that people say what is it about you? You seem to be having such a good time and I am not, why is it that you are having such a, now they are asking that's a whole bogy(ph) it's a new born. Our chief had a wonderful line he said "If one would escape from prison the first thing that person must realize is that they are in prison. If they think they are free no escape is possible." That's such a beautiful mind twister that until you realize that you are not standing in the best place forget it let the person go on you don't come on to them. 

00:42:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, you have an interesting chapter in… in your book How Can I Help which deals with this concept of the prison and… and helping as a prison feeling that I am the helper puts me in a prison. 

00:42:20
RAM DASS Oh! Boy that the whole… I realized that the hype of helping is that the helper often psychologically helps at the expense of the helped that it is a way that reinforces rules and the helped his disenfranchised and the helper is empowered. And its very interesting it's not the act itself I can take this cup of water and offer it to you and I can offer to you in a way where I build myself up and put you down by dong it or I could offer it in a way where it's our cup of water you need it, you drink from it I need it I drink from it in which I also appreciate that you are receiving it is it much part of the contract is my offering it and… and… and its, the question of whether you identify with the rule or not and when you identify with the rule it ends up being divisive it separates people. There are plenty of people in hospitals who are surrounded by well many people who do good and the person feels isolated and lonely and separately. And it's interesting because everybody is busy loving them but their loving them is an object loving that person is an object and their helping them is an object and the art is being with somebody as subject not as object. 

00:43:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You often use the phrase sort of hanging out together. 

00:43:40
RAM DASS Hanging out yeah and it's really like, one awareness and two forms and we are talking to ourselves now Jeffrey. We are just making believe that it's a game of dialogue you know because we are both reflecting to figure out the truth. Then the truth lies behind both of us. 

00:43:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And in a sense anyone who is viewing us right now is also viewing themselves. 

00:44:00
RAM DASS It's all part of the same thing and it doesn't matter who is doing the talking that's the fun be and I lecture all the time and I think I am like a rental mouth. I am for a process that's going on and I just say it good I am not busy being the speaker I am listening as well as everybody else is this is a dialogue that includes the… the… the viewer and you and me and we are all just figuring it out. 

00:44:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I get the sense you know and I… I go back and forth sometimes I think when we get very philosophical like this that… that it's a total head trip and… and may be totally irrelevant to things happening in the world and then I think to myself No its, it's essential that nothing really changes until we change in this way by raising these questions. 

00:44:50
RAM DASS Yeah I… I think your later view was probably the right one, I think that when you look at how you change your system that the component of the system has to change that the individual has to be standing in a slightly different place for the system which they are part to change and that the minute that's what the story of a Buddha or a Christ or a Muhammad or something like that, they were all beings who were you say they were dancing to a different drama or whatever that expression is they were, but they were, they were listening to a different part of their being and the result was that they brought in an oblique entrance into the whole system that… that allow the system to adapt in a way and shift and you look at a system like a political governance system and the media and the constituency and you see how everything is feeding back on itself in a networking way where everybody is reinforcing a conspiracy to see reality as real and then you see how you have to extricate yourself as an individual back in order to be able to contribute into it because you look at the conspiracy that we have collectively created and you realize people are happy within it and there is no reason why we cannot all be happy that is really there is absolutely no reason why that couldn't be it's a con… it's a conspiracy of mind that we are struck in its bizarre that… that has its economic spinner off and political spinner off and all this stuff. 

00:46:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well ultimately I suppose if… if you take that seriously it would seem like a spiritual machine for you to, to work to create a heaven on earth. 

00:46:35
RAM DASS But I am doing that very selfishly because I want to live in it I mean I work on myself in a order to be a peace, to be free, to be free of suffering and to be happy, and I realized that as I succeed in that I am in an environment in which other people can do that as well in my presence and there is nothing in me that's going to keep them stuck in their suffering, and then the question is what do you do with your time? And as you listen and as you have experienced a unity of feeling with people then you are in the interesting position where if they are hungry it's not their hunger it's our hunger and then suddenly, I am in Guatemala or I am in Nepal or I am with the American-Indians or I am with somebody dying or somebody with AIDS and they call and its like that part of us is just come into our consciousness and out of that comes an action. It's interesting that you just had to open yourself to the Universe and then, there were different sufferings make themselves manifests. 

00:47:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And the way you describe when you are working with the dying or when you are working with refugees or… or with people who are hungry, in spite of their misery you seem to be experiencing the most poinient moments. 

00:47:50
RAM DASS Well it's a combination and that's the art it's a combination that my heart hurts so bad because they hurt and I am aware of the pain of whatever the situation is then there is another part of me that loves them so much because they are just another phase of the beloved, that's what mother Teresa sees she sees Christ in all his distressing disguises and the lepers and the people she deals with and then there is other part of me it's just watching my own reactivity and getting quieter and quieter behind it and there is another part that's just meeting another part of myself you there I am here you got your trip I got my trip is there anything we can do for each other on the level of trips but let's not lose that we are here and I go down to Guatemala and I go into a village where the people have hardly any education among Indians and I look in the eyes of a widow and she is right there and we are just fellow beings we can talk to each other because I don't speak her language we can even speak but we are right there we recognize the unity of quality of our being and we realize we don't wish to do each other violence, we don't wish to there is nothing we have to do other than, maybe it will be an exchange we are all provide a whole for her to hold the land who knows it doesn't matter what the game is, because if she had some and I didn't she give it to me. 

00:49:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Is there a sense that… that she does have something that we… we don't have yeah. 

00:49:20
RAM DASS She does and I am getting it… I am getting it I come back from all these missions of doing good, I come back so enriched you feel end up feeling guilty, you feel like you rip it off the system. 

00:49:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When we… we take these meek people on the planet and… and strip them is we have a all positions in any pretence to being somebody in the world than that leaves them with a sense of being which we have lost often and. 

00:49:40
RAM DASS We have often lost. When I am in India I live in a little village in India a lot up in the foot hills on the Himalayas and I live with people who they usually have one hot meal a day I mean its… its… its pretty good but its thin its way below our poverty level in this culture and I look in their eyes and their hearts and those people are much more fulfilled than the middle class in this culture is and I say, let me sit here and drink of the wisdom in these beings that allows them not to equate their state of well being with their material condition and I realized that something that I can help bring back to the West if you will in a way by my own being. Then the question is how what should be my style of life to make that statement I mean do I go live in a park I mean what's the way to make the statement and then you realize that if you try to make it with your mind it's too cute you have to go in intuitively and just respond from moment to moment to hear how to do it. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There have been various spiritual teachers who have written on social and political issues, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Aurobindo, Muhammad. Do any of these teachers who really moved you to… to derive your inspiration for many of these writers. 

00:51:05
RAM DASS Yeah lot of them. It's a tricky one because when you go into the spiritual world you can, see social action is the action of good guys it's the action of righteousness and in Hinduism that's known as the Golden chain it's the ultimate trap you have got to go beyond goodness in order to be the goodness not to do good and so some of the spiritual teachers say, look don't get involved in like Rmakrishna(ph) Maharishi says, what are you trying to help the world you don't even though know who you are, you don't even though what's it above what are you busy doing something, you know… you know maybe you are creating more trouble, you caught it, you help it and that's true and often we turn out to be doing just that by the way. 

00:51:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Many examples. 

00:51:50
dassMany examples in my own life by the way so, I do understand that, but then the others say you can't wait till you are enlighten to do good because there is so much suffering around you and it hurts so and to the extent that you ignore it you are ignoring part of yourself and there is a cost in turning off yourself you have got a keep it under wraps so, you work with the suffering in order to free other people you work on it as part of the game along with you know that's a method to get enlightened. So the spiritual journey takes you both ways, like Gandhi struggled with this all the time and he go back into retreat and then he come out and he said a beautiful thing he said, when you have surrendered completely into God you find yourself in the service of all that exists it becomes your joy and recreation or recreation and you never tire of it there is no burn out because if, I, if this hand is in the fire and this hand pulls it out this hand doesn't have to go and say, thank you this hand didn't do it to be a good guy there is no burn out of doing it it's just, it's the way it is and that's the life, that's where that kind of service comes from of spirit. My Ishta-deva or my spiritual vehicle in Hinduism in my name Ram Dass which means servant of God is Hanuman the monkey I mean, I am a monkey worshiper at some bizarre I have got a monkey on my back and… and the question, Hanuman, 

00:53:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hanuman is a popular Gods in India. 

00:53:25
RAM DASS I know it, and Hanuman has incredible powers and he has the powers and he is even known as the breath of Ram and that's the name of God in that particular Yuga that time, times spent and Hanuman has a power because he lives only to serve God he is doing it all in order to serve God and the interesting question of what, that's what Mother Teresa, that's what she is getting her juice(ph) she knows she is only serving God. 

00:53:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know I have seen these wonderful graphic images of… of Hanuman, I collect Hindu art work and its incredibly powerful the way he rips open his chest. 

00:54:00
RAM DASS Yes, that's the… the story of that is, that he is given by Ram a beautiful jewel bracelet and he starts to look at it and its very valuable and he starts to bite it with his teeth and break it and everybody says, what kind of an in grader, you hear Gods given you a gift and you are. He says, this is of no use to me he says, I don't see Rams name written anywhere in it and they said, why don't you get rid of your body, because Rams name isn't written there either and he rips open his chest and there is Ram and Sita in the middle of his chest and every muscle and bone has Ram, Ram, Ram written on it it's you see and it's in a way that you are failure of being has become not out of a hype thing it's just you get so blissed out by becoming part of this larger game of law of it's not lost who conceptual it's a, it's a kind of dove the kind of waive of things, the wave of things. 

00:55:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know the name of God is a tricky, tricky business it seems that, people all over the planet understand God in… in many, many ways and yet it's… it's the name of God that seems to divide them. 

00:55:15
RAM DASS The term God is a really tough one to work with him. Well do you believe in God? I mean it immediately it becomes a thing and, I mean I… I'm… I'm in a way I am sorry I even used the word anymore because I don't know how to deal with it I just because its everything and its nothing and its all you and I but not as exclusively. 

00:55:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The Muslims and Jews are both manual feasts ultimately they have to have the same God if they all believe there is only one God and yet they seem to believe that they worship different Gods. 

00:55:50
RAM DASS No the trap is that, there is the concept of the chosen people. That some people are closer to God than others and that's such a hype that's such an unfortunate hype I mean we are all the chosen people, the chosen people are the once that listen to the word of God one cries stand in there and say, your mother and brother are without, and he says, my mother and brother are the people who are with God it's not my physical plain parents it's my spiritual parent it's my spiritual family and it feels so painful to me that we are using religiosity as… in such a divisive way in the world today. That's very, very painful it's too bad. 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yet there have been. 

00:56:30
RAM DASS That's bad too. It's the way it is but it's too bad. 

00:56:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There have been efforts from time to time to… to unify politically by unifying in… in terms of everybody having the same name of God, and everybody having the same religion. 

00:56:45
RAM DASS Yeah usually the unifier is trying to rip it off for a power thing that's what's interesting. I mean very really are the unifiers surrendering into the process there are some like, there was a beautiful man Sufi Samuel(ph) Marshall Sam Louise and he would go to a… 

00:57:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A Jewish Sufi. 

00:57:00
RAM DASS He would go, a Jewish Sufi he will go to Palestine and hold these dancers which he had in the followers of Islam and… and followers of the… of the Torah and you know and they all dance together and they would call dancers of peace and he was a beautiful self very humble I mean wise guy, he was a rascal, he was a, I love that. I love that role, I love that role in… in integrating these values. 

00:57:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I mean what's the… the basic idea of Muhammad and perhaps Aurobindo and some of the others that… that would have eventually be a world government and it would a theocracy of some kind based on this notion that we all are united in God. 

00:57:45
RAM DASS I think that the only really viable living social institution is the individual human heart. I think the minute you try to create any intuitional structures beyond that it… it has a very short half life of living spirit before it just decays into a… a memory of a thought really I think it's extremely hard to keep a United Nations living truth I mean which had a high aspiration but its distinctive to keep alive and I think it's true of all social institutions a marriage you have got to keep reinvesting it, reinvesting it and reinvesting it to keep it living true. And anything less than living truth is demeaning to the human condition. 

00:58:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You're sound like an anarchist. 

00:58:30
RAM DASS Well if you take that in a political way I would say that, the social institutions that exist because they are true to the intuitive relativity of the human hearts involved. That's anarchy in a sense like… like my Guru once said to somebody about their marriage, he said, love is the only marriage contract that's anarchy, that's saying you got to go back again and again and see if it's still true that we are should be together. 

00:59:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words if you really in the heart in now you are really true to the… to the truth of the moment that then any kind of institutionalization of that would be a violation. 

00:59:10
RAM DASS Yeah unless you work you say we are coming together in this institution to keep this quality alive that's what the Seva Foundation is about that's what we are attempting to do. We are saying can we create an institution that can have the… the benefits of an institution and that we can collaboratively do more as a group we can be an organization in the eyes of the governments and things like that as we are in Nepal and still keep it living truth and its hard work. The boards are like groups encounter the board meeting is like groups encounters. We have got to cut through all our stuff each time to come back to the living, to our vision once again what is our vision or we are just caught in a historical fight that we are now carrying out because we are good guys that isn't good enough it isn't god enough. 

00:59:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's at least for a number of years has been working for the Seva Foundation. 

01:00:00
RAM DASS Right on the edge, right on the edge. If you doesn't… If you don't keep right on top of it, it can decay immediately into well meaningless in which we are all milky and it's all good I want one of you to do such good work in all oh! Thank you, you know that whole thing and you lost it. 

01:00:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Whether it seems to be is… is you mentioned the… the concept of the half life of an… of an institution, a period in which when institutions are founded in the original founders are there… there is this vitality they… they stay in the moment, they stay with the spirit and then they become hardened and crystallized when the followers. 

01:00:30
RAM DASS It's like when the its starts as a visionary or an entrepreneur and then the managerial class or the priest class takes over and the minute that happens they have a vested interest in the power of the institution, because that's where they get their Jews while the visionary or mystic got their Jews out of the connection with the living truth and if you have an institution that forces each person to find their own truth there is still small voice within that the Quakers talk about that kind of thing then you are rejuvenating it because that's… that's social institution of the human heart is to me the living interface between the spirit and the material world and that's why each of you got to keep going back to that one. 

01:01:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We began this, interview by talking about the problems that we are faced with nuclear war potential for holocaust, ecological catastrophe it's as if, if we don't really get it together on this planet we are… we are facing the extinction of the human race and… 

01:01:35
RAM DASS That all sense very dramatic. 

01:01:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It does you know. 

01:01:35
RAM DASS Now from a Hindu point of view ah so well that happened again and will start again. I mean because who we are isn't the human race. The human race are like the Fords or Chevrolets that we… we use that's not behind it all we just are and as long as you are afraid of death, the fear is going to direct almost all your behavior we have got to ward off that and finally say, yes it may indeed… we may destroy ourselves this time around and I will allow that possibility and I will do what I can to prevent it, but I am not going to out of fear I am doing it… do it just because it's my part to play in the dance. 

01:02:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I… I have to agree with you that we really do need to take a larger perspective that instead of step outside of our human skin here because in some sense life goes on. 

01:02:30
RAM DASS Some sense something goes on, something although the even calling it something the Buddhists would take exceptions to it, I love it. 

01:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Some process continues, but if I were to step back inside of my human skin for a moment and not out of fear but, out of… out of the feeling of… of calmness and love and compassion desire in this… in this beautiful thing this human race to continue and… and thinking in my own mind may be in some visionary sense, how can we unify ourselves realizing what we have just said about the institutions and… and the pit falls that happening through institutions. There is… there is almost… 

01:03:10
RAM DASS I must say that there is nothing to do so be it. Be the unification and then it will all happen around you. But every time you look at somebody as somebody that you are to unify you have just made them into somebody and you have made them separate from yourself and then you are doing something to them and… and actually there is only us it's just we all are here nothing is, it's all over we won I mean there is all these different ways of looking at the thing instead of I got to do all these works so we will win, we already won all we got to do is, is allow the fact that we are in God's grace it's all going to be fine with so busy making into a hell all the time. We are saying if there were only peace I could be happy there is what there is why can't you be happy with what there is and do the best you can to relieve the stuff but don't let your happiness be contingent upon it. So that you start to live like a winner instead of like a loser in a game with whatever you got, with whatever you got and that. 

01:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Let me go and push the point a little bit further. One… one of my… one of my mentors has been the Harvard Sociologist Pitirim Sorokin and who… who grew up in the Soviet Union or before it was the Soviet Union in Russia and became a very high cabinet member in the Kerensky government. Before he came to Harvard when he was kicked up by Lenin founded the department of social relations at Harvard where you taught. 

01:04:35
RAM DASS I was in the faculty and he was way ahead of his time, you know really his book on Altruism is exquisite. 

01:04:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He wrote at one point that he thought we might be moving into a period in which the western style of Capitalism and the Soviet style of Communism would merge that we would see the common unity there… there we are just good as we think we are then notice bad as they thing they are because we think they are. 

01:05:00
RAM DASS Well that's the benefit that the drug lords are giving us because they are becoming a new common enemy. It's just like if we were in attack by beings from Mars or something like that suddenly the Russians wouldn't be so bad and their system wouldn't be so bad because we will all be united around something which is what happened in the Second World War, around Hitler's vision of reality. 

01:05:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

01:05:25
RAM DASS And in the same way, that the drug threat of… of the exploitation of weakness of addiction potential in human consciousness means that's becoming the prime issue now instead of Capitalism versus Communism and now to keep that paranoia going you got to keep work in order to keep generating the yes, but look what happened in Afghanistan, yes but look at the Jews that can't still get out of there. All of which is true but look at the way we are if you… if you look at any system it all has a lot of problems with it I mean all of these system, systems themselves do not. A conceptual system is not the same as living truth, living truth is not a concept its, it's what it is. 

01:06:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you seem to also be saying that, if we are unified because of the common enemy because of a sense of antagonism or hatred we are not really wining the game. 

01:06:20
RAM DASS It's a very short term, it's a very short term unity, it's a cheap unity. The deeper unity is the unity of recognizing across the boundaries of Russian, American, Jew, Christian, Islam, you here I am here you know and that… that's why when they, when we went to the moon and then took a picture of the earth and people saw that, that picture of the earth was worth many millions of words in the sense of giving people the sense of Mcloone's global village or whatever you want to call, that's the kind of a game that up levels but that's just on the physical plan. 

01:06:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well there is something to the global village in terms of what you mentioned earlier about, about the individualists being the primary institution because with… with media, with computer technology it's as if we can bypass so many of these other institutional forms and people can communicate to each other on a one to one basis. 

01:07:15
RAM DASS Multinationals have may they made nationalism and an acronysm, it's just dying hard roughly is what's happening we are wanting economic system now and we are just learning how to, we are just learning how to be with what's happened to us. It's like some major thing happens but, everybody is busy holding on who we were before. Now you could say, well we have just moved from the industrial to the information age that would be one way of saying. But that's kind of trivializing it to and beyond that is the spiritual consciousness age you know you could do with that way. I don't know how to get hold of it all I know is we haven't yet grown into who we are and who we are has nationalism as a quiet an acronysm. It's a functional unit the way our egos are but nobody wants to live there. 

01:08:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's sounds like a very optimistic note. It sounds as if you know back to our earlier point that the human spirit has really evolved. 

01:08:15
RAM DASS Yeah I guess I feel it has because in my culture… in my culture in… in this country, I noticed that 20 years ago, I would say the farthest out things I could find using drugs, using meditation, using everything and there will be a few people sitting and going yeah, yeah because they knew, because they were in the explorers club with me. Now 20 years later, I speak to an audience that's prime almost main stream not quiet but they are from 20 to 80 years old most of them never took drugs they never read eastern philosophy and I am saying the same things I was saying 20 years ago, go now, going like that. Now how do they know that, how do they know what got in, what… what… what main streamed, what see something it's as if what we did in the 60's something really worked, something happened and we don't yet recognize that history can't yet because history which is his story is still telling the story from back there, it's not telling the story from what's happened yet I love it, I love it. 

01:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We were talking a little earlier about Aurobindo when his concept of… of history being a process of… of the higher consciousness working through people. 

01:09:30
RAM DASS Yes, and opening you open to let it come through you to manifest and the you become a conduit for the, for the wisdom the higher wisdom to manifest on earth, it's like Mozart for example, he is a good example I mean you get a feeling of Mozart if most people have seen the movie where Mozart madly riding and you think is he creating that and then you realize he is just got a door open to where it is, he is a great copier he is copying down this incredible music and he, and… and so you get that feeling with all the great creators with Bah, with… with Michelangelo you get a feeling that they just were open to another plain of reality and they were just bringing it down through them and when you open to that other plain of reality you get a sense of the harmony of the universe which includes the cacophony it is not mean that, all the tension or cacophony is gone. It's a tolerance for the complexity of the game because if you are going to get manifestation in form you have to have positive and negative, and dark and light and good and evil and you know all of it otherwise there is no manifestation and in fact there… there isn't so. 

01:10:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So why are we talking about it. 

01:10:55
RAM DASS Well the fun is there is no way to stand that's the ultimate wisdom there is no way to stand that I can have ultimate wisdom it's another hype… because the statement is alive but the ultimate wisdom of nowhere to stand means anyplace you say this is real it's only relatively real. 

01:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Here is where it's at. 

01:11:15
RAM DASS Yeah including the fact that nothing ever happened and there is no form. You just keep at first you go in and out of plains of consciousness sequentially, you get high and you come down or you and I talking and who are we, we are we two men sitting and talking, or we two old cave dwellers sitting by the fire reek exploring the deepest wisdom, I mean which mythical game do you want to play about us and then you go behind and it is only one of us talking to itself and then you go behind that nothing is happening at all as… you know all these fun. 

01:11:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What… what you're saying, reminds me of the myth of the Greek God Proteus who won rustles(ph) with and he always change his forms and to keep up with him he becomes an animal you got to become a bigger animal and then he becomes a different animal and you have to change with him all the time. 

01:12:05
RAM DASS And the art is to just not try to be standing anywhere because the minute you are standing somewhere if he changes you are vulnerable and the minute you are not any one then each moment is a new moment and you see who am I this time? Because you don't even know who you are. People say who are you? I don't know who I am, that's fun I mean people don't realize is like what you are going to be when you grow up well I am not planning to grow up, so it's kind of irrelevant… I mean it's… it's this funny reversal of the whole game of becoming somebody. The way I see it is we spend all of our early years becoming somebody then we start to awaken and we realize we got trapped in the creation of somebodiness and we go in a nobody training and then we become nobody, not nobody which is somebody but nothing special and then we are everything. Calor Rinpoche(ph) one of my beautiful teachers he said, "Once you see the illusion you realize you are nobody and being nobody you are everybody." 

01:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems that in the realm of politics the real survivors are the once who are able to sort of change with the moment. 

01:13:10
RAM DASS Exactly because they don't have such a vested interest and how it comes out, because they are delighting in the dance of life instead of I got to make it come out this way. 

01:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well occasionally you get people like that and then they have their moment in the sun but they fade because they can't change. 

01:13:25
RAM DASS Exactly right, exactly right and the dance of the change in surrendering into the new moment like a very poignant was Roseline and Jimmy Carter's autobiography of what happened the day after they left the White House and they are back in plains Georgia with all the mementos in the attic and the trucks drive away and there, they are and they got the rest of their life. Now the question is how quickly do you let go or how busy are you being milking your moment of worldly power which was just another trip really. 

01:14:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, you are always very pleased to see Jimmy Carter working in the Bronx as a carpenter. 

01:14:05
RAM DASS I think he has worked very hard to continue to grow. I think he… he is a good example of somebody making an effort to stay and that's why I work with ageing a lot because aging is got such a psychological hype going with it. I have been working on a book called Wisdom of Aging to show the way in which we get, we conspire to make aging something that has and we treat to cline of certain capacities as loss but it's interesting… I go into Burma to a monastery and I sit on and I draw my awareness in from my hearing, from my seeing from my smelling in order that would be quieter and deeper to do the inner work. When you get all those, you lose your hearing, you lose your sight all those things are the optimum conditions necessary for doing the inner work and everybody is saying oh! My God I can't hear like I used to isn't that terrible, terrible I don't know. 

01:15:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You have some remarkable examples in your book, How Can I Help of people who have gone to help these so called crippled helpless people and discovered that they had much to learn from them. 

01:15:15
RAM DASS Oh yeah always incredible. 

01:15:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I remember one story of a… of a woman in a hospital working with mentally retarded children I think of a mental age of two or three years old then and she was just trying to teach them how to say a simple thing like, I am doing very well like that and the little kid. 

01:15:35
RAM DASS Enjoying was putting our own. 

01:15:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah he winked her at one point. 

01:15:40
RAM DASS Exactly yeah and that another story of the woman in the social agency who determined to help one of the needy woman and she try to do everything and the woman just it not that they ever worked she couldn't, because the woman really wasn't trying very hard and they ended up finally in a park in the rain in which the woman the… the needy woman says, "There is nothing more you can do for me you just been here" and they sit together in such quiet joy of just their friendship and their presence and they both grew so much and especially the one that was busy being the social agent I love those stories. 

01:16:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well what you have done in this book is you've attempted to really address that question for people who sincerely want to help and then when they come up against it and… and realizes so many of the things that we do that we think they are helping end up not working. 

01:16:30
RAM DASS But it doesn't mean not to help it means to use your experience of helping as a way to grow and there is such potential growth in helping another human being. If you be truthful about it all and bring your truth into the situation and watch yourself get entrapped in a roll and a conspiracy and then sit out and quiet down and see what you did and come back in again and there is nothing wrong in losing it, losing it is part of the journey, you lose it you get up as Aurobindo says, you brush yourself off you look sheepishly at God and you take the next step. It's a lovely image and then you fall in your face again and helping is just a beautiful art form because we have such a… a… a natural compassionate heart and what we are really afraid of is our own heart because our heart would give away the sorer, the heart says, here take it you need it you take it take… it take my life take my money, take my card and the mind is saying now watch it think about tomorrow. Christ image it would be like the lilies in the field that's like be the heart just trust it all open it's okay and we are so frightened of that… that we have built stuff that has ended up starving us to death. We are starving because we are afraid of our own heart and there must be another way and that's what you do helping to explore how you can allow that spontaneous compassionate and spontaneous generosity to express itself and work with it and realize you can set limits without having to close yourself down from yourself. 

01:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One of the things that you pointed out is that, perhaps the greatest gift we could give to other people is just to listen. 

01:18:15
RAM DASS Yeah, exactly because they feel heard… they feel heard but the it's interesting to listen and to not get entrapped in their mind to listen but to let it go, but to hear them but not just buy it but hear it. 

01:18:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah not to get caught up in that. 

01:18:35
RAM DASS I often say I hear you sometimes that frustrates people because they don't want just be heard they want to be reacted to. 

01:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They want to entangle you. 

01:18:40
RAM DASS They want to entangle you. 

01:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What did you call it, the reality net? 

01:18:45
RAM DASS Yeah, there was a great lady that came to visit me, she was a seamstress and her… her youngest daughter had gone to visit her older daughter and forged the check and she came in with this tale of pity about how her husband had left her and she worked her fingers to the bone she showed me to take care of these girls and now this girl has turned bad and it took about ten minutes to tell me it was like the ancient mariner and I listened as hard as I could which she hold on and I said I hear you. She was in a saddest file and she told me the whole story all over again and she got all done I said, I hear you and at that moment I was just looking at her and she said, you know she said, "I was kind of a alien when I was a girl too" and at that moment she came up for air. I heard her but I didn't climb in because she had sucked everybody oh! You poor dear oh! My God that in grade you know that whole thing. 

01:19:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's so important I think for… for people to hear themselves as they tell others stories as they grow. 

01:19:40
RAM DASS And then you become a mirror for them to see their own trip and if they want to see it they can and if they don't that's up to them. You don't lay a trip you don't I realized you morally have no right to take away another human being suffering. That's a big one. 

01:19:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That is a big one. 

01:20:00
RAM DASS I know it, I know it. I have really learned a lot about that because I you look at somebody suffering and you see if they shifted and you want so special if their family and you love them you want to take away their suffering and that is the quickest way to alienate them to create more paranoia because you live in no violence suffer you don't understand. 

01:20:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well I guess there is a sense you… you mentioned earlier the need to sort of look suffering right in the eye and that means to acknowledge it. 

01:20:30
RAM DASS Yes and death as well and death as well. You know I think preparing a slideshow, I mean the light would bring death out of the closet in life too. Slideshow, taking these images and asking people to stay with them and watch their own reactions and keep their heart open and see this is another face of the beloved just practice doing this, just practice doing it, because you walk down the street the people you meet in the supermarket, filling station all of them are just other faces of all other faces of beloved. 

01:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It sounds like a tantric discipline essentially. 

01:21:00
RAM DASS It is yeah, I have a little thought table with holy pictures on it and I have Buddha and Christ and my Guru and I have for long term I had Caspar Weinberger on there who used to be Secretary of Defense because I disagree with his policy so strongly that when I would think about him something would close in me and I would come in… I might sit down and I light my incense and say good morning Buddha, good morning Christ, Good morning Maharaj, Hello Caspar and then I saw, how much work I have to do because until I could love him enough behind Caspar in us there was no way my mind could be an environment where he could change if he needed… if he wanted or needed to change may be he doesn't want that's up to him but, I am not going to be so busy locking in him into who he things he is that he can change. 

01:21:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What sounds like you are attempting to… to live Christ teaching of resist not evil. 

01:22:00
RAM DASS Wow! Is that true resist not evil, I would say evil actions are resist and I oppose. I would say, but I don't see people as evil, I see actions as evil that actions increase suffering or separateness I see suffering rooted in ignorance as Buddha did and the ignorance leads to directly into the illusion of separateness, and the minute you separate you are suffering. 

01:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah and the crucial distinction here again is between the action and the person. 

01:22:30
RAM DASS Between the action and the person and the idea is you keep your heart open to the being at the same moment you are doing what you need to do about the action and its interesting when you are opposing somebody like I was at a antinuclear demonstration and coming right up to the line and opposing a policeman or somebody and seeing them as another being just like you just doing their best to find their truth and loving them and at the same moment saying I can't allow you to do that, I must say no but saying no in a way that says I love you. 

01:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That seems to be the essence or the message of the Bhagavad-Gita. 

01:23:10
RAM DASS Yeah and the… I had it so demonstrated by my Guru in India because the word he used the most frequently was "Jao" which means go, split, get lost. I mean all the gurus, people think the guru saying come, come he will say go Ram Dass go. You know I come 6000 miles sit at his feet, offer him fruit he look at me hit me on the head and say, "Jao" go and I would say go I was offended that he was sending me away and then afterwards I heard the word "Jao" who came out of a place where he is saying go with love, everywhere is love, there is no you don't have to stay here it's all love you know "Jao" I love you, I mean and learning how to say no in a way that brings people closer. That's such an art form, such an art form, that one is the… one of the deepest wisdoms that I have touched that's far and I am just learning how to do it now. 

01:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Go with love. 

01:24:00
RAM DASS Yeah, say no without closing your heart. Because like when you have a child and the child wants an extra ice cream which you know is going to give him, may be a bad stomach or something and you say, no usually you are empathizing with the fact that the child's going to feel frustrated so you are feeling that, which closes you up and then the child probably angry at you. So you are going to be the object of anger by someone you love so that closes you up more. So you are saying no with a different tone and then you would yes. 

01:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Then you become like a parent child instead of two beings. 

01:24:35
RAM DASS Exactly, exactly and a beautiful conscious being seized, we are just dancing as parent and child, we are two souls, we are two beings and for a while I will play like I am your parent and you play like that you are a child and as a parent I say, no or yes, but don't get lost in it, I am still here. 

01:24:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well Ram Dass its being a pleasure playing interviewer with you… 

01:24:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hasn't it been Jeffrey? For me too. 

01:24:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's been a real joy. 

01:25:00
RAM DASS Yeah very nice, thanks so much for being with me. 

01:25:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks so much for being with me. 

01:25:00
RAM DASS My pleasure. 

01:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.
