Sally St. George, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
Dan Wulff, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
DAN WULFF When we were preparing this TED talk, we knew that there's a lots of people who had done work to try to curtail violence in the world, and so we looked actually at a couple of TED talks and one of them we looked at was by Julia Bacha, who made the point in her TED talk that nonviolent efforts need to be more recognized, they need to be noticed by the media. Usually, efforts to use nonviolent methods over violent methods did not make the media and if there was an effort to kind of showcase through media efforts better, nonviolence would be more appreciated and maybe have a greater influence. So we were wondering about different ways that we could impact the issue of violence and try to promote nonviolence. 

00:01:05
Peter Gabriel fights injustice 

00:01:05
with video 

00:01:05
SALLY ST. GEORGE So second video that we looked at was by Peter Gabriel, and one of the things that he had done was put video capability in the hands of lots of people to record things that were violent in the hope of interrupting the violence by having it shown. Like Dan said, our intent is also about interruption. 

00:01:25
words 

00:01:25
have 

00:01:25
power 

00:01:25
DAN WULFF Social constructionists, as we are, pay attention to the power that words have. Our first objective today at this talk is to be reminded the words of Tom Anderson that language is not innocent. 

00:01:40
SALLY ST. GEORGE Our second objective is to experience the kinds of words that we might use that may inadvertently exude violence. 

00:01:50
STICKS 

00:01:50
AND 

00:01:50
STONES 

00:01:50
DAN WULFF And another objective is to consider the impact of removing violent expressions from our everyday language. 

00:01:55
Peace-filled metaphors 

00:01:55
SALLY ST. GEORGE And the fourth thing that we hope to accomplish even in 30 minutes is become more aware and more vigilant in using peace-filled metaphors than the ones we currently use. 

00:02:10
Our concern 

00:02:10
We hear/use violent language 

00:02:10
frequently in everyday talk and 

00:02:10
wonder if these casual uses of violent 

00:02:10
words/phrases might in some way 

00:02:10
encourage and 

00:02:10
stimulate violent actions 

00:02:10
and relationships 

00:02:10
DAN WULFF Our concern is that just perhaps the way in which use language casually in everyday talk may support inadvertently violent behaviors. This is just kind of a hypothesis or a guess, and we are wondering what would happen if we pay more attention to the ways in which we use violent terms and phrases in everyday talk. 

00:02:35
Examples of violent talk from last week 

00:02:35
SALLY ST. GEORGE So we have some examples, and I have some examples from what I would call violent talk from last week that I heard. In a recent family therapy meeting, I heard parents talking about picking their battles with their children. To speak of discipline as a battle zone, I heard adolescents -- I heard an adolescent say this, "Well, our house is like a war zone. Everyone is ready for combat from the moment we get up in the morning." 

00:03:00
Examples from family therapy sessions 

00:03:00
"First we are polite and then we 

00:03:00
repeat and then we bring out the big 

00:03:00
guns-we threaten to take away the 

00:03:00
electronics." 

00:03:00
"We will give it a shot." 

00:03:00
DAN WULFF  Parents describing their disciplinary actions and plans, they say something like this, "First we are polite, and then we repeat and then we bring out the big guns. We threaten to take away the electronics." Or "We will give it a shot." Family after discussion about alternative ways of handling the situation may use all kinds of languages, all kinds of phrases and words that support violent ways of thinking. 

00:03:35
SALLY ST. GEORGE Here's another example. The first one is an adolescent justifying why he will not speak with his parents. "Why should I? The minute I say anything they go ballistic." The second example is a dad talking about his own temper. "These kids don't even give you a chance to think. They are always shooting off their mouths and when they are not shooting off their mouths, they are giving us looks that could kill. How are we supposed to have a conversation when these things really burn me?" And these are real things that we hear. 

00:04:05
"Why should I? The minute I say 

00:04:05
anything they go ballistic." 

00:04:05
"These kids don't even give you a 

00:04:05
chance to think. They are always 

00:04:05
shooting off their mouths and if 

00:04:05
they are not shooting off their 

00:04:05
mouths they are giving us looks that 

00:04:05
could kill. How are we supposed to 

00:04:05
have a conversation when these 

00:04:05
things really burn me?" 

00:04:05
DAN WULFF Next. Phrases we hear in class. "When push comes to shove, I just have to skim the readings." When asked for their thoughts in a discussion, one student asked "Can I be brutally honest with you and give you my real opinion or do I need to be politically correct?" Or "You are right on target with that argument." Or "What I was struck by in the reading was..." 

00:04:30
Phrases heard in class 

00:04:30
"When push comes to shove I just have to 

00:04:30
skim the readings." 

00:04:30
When asked for their thoughts in a 

00:04:30
discussion, one student asked, "Can I be 

00:04:30
brutally honest and give my real opinion 

00:04:30
or do I need to be politically correct?" 

00:04:30
Feedback from one student to another: 

00:04:30
"You are right on target with that 

00:04:30
argument." 

00:04:30
"What I was struck by in the reading 

00:04:30
was..." 

00:04:30
SALLY ST. GEORGE Actually this first headline that's in the media is one of the things that got us started, the idea of 'fighting domestic violence' made no sense to us. And yet, I mean, we understand it and we understand what's going on but it just -- the words just don't seem to fit. Or 'the war on cancer continues'. And again, we understand it, we understand the spirit of it, but we worry about what the words convey. Or that we are 'fighting crime'. 

00:05:00
Headlines in the media 

00:05:00
"Director of Social Services to lead 

00:05:00
Fight Against Domestic Violence: New 

00:05:00
Prevention Program Funded" 

00:05:00
"War on Cancer Continues" 

00:05:00
"Fight Crime" 

00:05:00
DAN WULFF Next please. A picture from a recent newspaper. Behead those who say Islam is violent. 

00:05:10
SALLY ST. GEORGE  Here are things that we've just overheard in public either on the train or in the mall or people, you know, when you hear the one-sided conversations when they are on their cell phones like, "She is a real pistol, but we love her." "It always feels like he is twisting your arm to do something. Do you think so too?" "Normally I talk in class, but with that teacher I am gun shy. I don't know why." And once again, to keep the peace -- I love this one. "And once again, to keep the peace, I had to bite the bullet. Why do I always have to be the one to take it on the chin?" Very common metaphors. 

00:05:50
"She is a real pistol, but we love her." 

00:05:50
"It always feels like he is twisting your 

00:05:50
arm to do something for him. Do you 

00:05:50
think so too?" 

00:05:50
"Normally I talk in class, but with that 

00:05:50
teacher I am gun shy. I don't know why." 

00:05:50
"And once again, to keep the peace, I 

00:05:50
had to bite the bullet. Why do I always 

00:05:50
have to be the one to take it on the chin?" 

00:05:50
DAN WULFF US Presidential campaign uses lots of these metaphors. The Obama campaign is on the defense, the Romney campaign is on the offense. Attack ads. Battleground states. The candidates are slugging it out. 

00:06:05

00:06:05

00:06:05

00:06:05
Attack ads 

00:06:05
Battleground states 

00:06:05
The candidates are slugging it out. 

00:06:05
SALLY ST. GEORGE  Okay, I have to say I get a little active at home when we are talking about these kinds of things, especially with regard to sports. Sports are often cast as battles. We have victors. There's some team that's leading the charge. The team is under the gun. There's a fight to the finish. There's -- our luge competitors in Calgary are set for a duel. And the Bears were heroic warriors this last week. We're just bombarded -- bombarded! 

00:06:40

00:06:40
DAN WULFF So, if words can harm, if they can kill, if they can hurt, could they also heal, could they be used in a way that kind of promotes things that we want to promote. 

00:06:55
WORDS CAN KILL 

00:06:55
WORDS CAN HEAL 

00:06:55
your words hurt 

00:06:55
DAN WULFF In preparing this presentation, we wondered if we were to turn our attention away from violent language and maybe we are overly showcasing it here so far in this talk. So, we'd like to shift our focus onto the alternative words and phrases that can sideline violent expressions while still allowing us to express the ideas that we want to express. 

00:07:15
SALLY ST. GEORGE So to trim things around and to speak with more peace-filled or peaceful metaphors, we thought we will just make a list. We made the list of the other ones, you know, just right off the top of our heads. And you know, those didn't come quite as easy, I have to say, so we went to the Internet. And one of the places that we went to was this website by Dr. M. J. Hardman, and she has a website and she does a workshop and she calls it The Language of Peace: Constructing Non-Violent Metaphors. And she helps us with using metaphors from other professions, other activities that we might use in place of the more violent metaphors and so she has a model that we can use and we will give you some examples. 

00:08:00
DAN WULFF Next slide. This is from one of her worksheets at her conference. She says, something that's typically said maybe in any family. "Johnny, don't fight at school. Your mother is helping the war on cancer. Your father has his battles everyday at work. Your sister has to attack her studies. We just can't have you fighting at school." So how might this statement be done differently? 

00:08:25
"Johnny, don't fight at school. Your 

00:08:25
mother is helping the war on cancer. 

00:08:25
Your father has his battles everyday at 

00:08:25
work. Your sister has to attack her 

00:08:25
studies. We just can't have you 

00:08:25
fighting at school." 

00:08:25
How might this statement be done 

00:08:25
differently? 

00:08:25
SALLY ST. GEORGE  How could we -- what could we replace with combat metaphors? I mean, what metaphors could we use to replace combat metaphors? 

00:08:40
Architectural metaphors 

00:08:40
DAN WULFF  So some examples that she gave that we are going to pass on to you, we could use architectural metaphors. We could construct nonviolent metaphors instead of combat. We could build nonviolent metaphors. We could design nonviolent metaphors. We could plan them, we could make blueprints of nonviolent metaphors. 

00:09:05
Gardening metaphors 

00:09:05
SALLY ST. GEORGE She suggested some metaphors from gardening to use in place of combat metaphors, things like we could cultivate nonviolent metaphors, we could weed them out. We could uproot them. We could grow them, water them, feed them. 

00:09:20
Logic is not our most useful 

00:09:20
in a disagreement. 

00:09:20
DAN WULFF  And here is an exercise that she started and we added one. Logic is not our most useful what in a disagreement. We could use metaphors of fighting say, logic is not our most useful weapon in a disagreement. 

00:09:40
SALLY ST. GEORGE We're going to X that one out. 

00:09:40
DAN WULFF We could use a carpentry metaphor, logic is not our most useful tool in a disagreement. We could use a weaving metaphor, logic is not our most useful pattern in a disagreement. We could use art, logic is not our most useful paintbrush or pallet in a disagreement. We could use travel metaphors, logic is not our most useful or fastest way or the shortest distance or the best vehicle in a disagreement. We had another one about ballroom dancing because we are ballroom dancers, logic is not our most useful step or most coordinated position in a disagreement. 

00:10:20
PLANTING 

00:10:20
PEACE 

00:10:20
SALLY ST. GEORGE So we have lots of choices, but I think we need to think about them. If you want to go to her website, this is what it is and she has lots more metaphors that she uses. But before you go to that website, we'd like to have you do an activity. So we’re done talking. TED talks are quick. And we wanted also for you guys to practice this. So, we have an activity. We'd like you in pairs just very quickly. Each person in the pair select a phrase that you hear a lot or perhaps use a lot in your daily living, daily work that includes a violent term in it, kind of like the parents, who pick their battles with their kids, and then drop on another metaphor to substitute the violent word and so that you come up with a new saying that you can begin to use. And we think that if we change our language, people will hear it. And it will be maybe not a real conscious hearing, but after a while does start to repeat those kinds of things that we would rather hear than having them repeat the things that we say we would prefer that they don’t hear. 

00:11:25
SALLY ST. GEORGE We were hoping that you would be most willing to share your alternatives with the rest of the group so that we could go home with many more metaphors that are peace-filled instead of not so peace-filled. And I would like to pass the microphone around if you're willing to tell us what your alternatives are, and it will all be recorded on audio, not video, sorry. So are you guys willing to share yours? Okay, the sharing begins. 

00:12:00
 So we were going back to the metaphors that you were using to try to see if we could recast those in a different light, and the political discourse is a particularly unsettling one to me. I would prefer to see people talk about states with significant uncertainty rather than a battleground or that the candidates were planting the seeds for the future among their -- the listeners to their discussions. 

00:12:30
 I was saying to kind of that I'm having a brutal week and how violent that was, but I'm now willing to -- I need some good consonants sill. I'm willing to go less violent. I guess you're suggesting marathon, which feels kind of good but there were something about the brutal that felt really good. So I'm looking for some consonant-thick alternatives that are -- yucky, that feels good, something like that. 

00:13:00
SALLY ST. GEORGE Okay, we will be on the lookout for those and listening. 

00:13:05
  We were laughing because Bob came up with 'full throttle' and I said, most people won't know what that means. 

00:13:15
 I was starting to tell my anecdote and my first sentence was I was at the store Target, and they both started laughing because they thought that that's what I was bringing up, but it wasn't. But I thought that it could -- the store could be renamed 'Destination'. 

00:13:35
  In addition to the words that we found, I thought Emma had a really interesting observation then in Spanish, a lot of the words that represented something violent were feminina, feminine words. They end with 'a' instead of -- I though that was very interesting. 

00:13:55
SALLY ST. GEORGE Other alternative suggestions, alternatives, alternative metaphors, alternative wordings, some of your favorites that you use and are pondering getting rid of or reducing the use of? 

00:14:10
 Yeah. We had actually -- we didn't quite do the assignment or we flipped a little bit -- Randy had a great example. His was, you know, in obituaries, we often hear that somebody passed away after a courageous battle with cancer and Randy said, would we really want to change battle to dance? You know, I mean, sometimes the word does work, you know the word does work. One of my -- I'm really -- I hate the 'war on' and how often we use that in the US, it's a war on drugs, it's a war on cancer, the war on terror, most recently, the war on women. But you can't just interchange that, and you can't just find a peaceful substitute, and I have been racking my brains, how to rephrase the war on women because the war on women itself just so bothers me, but I really can't come up with anything, and so I'd ask for help. And finally, Phobitz said in Denmark that she often notices in organizations the phrase resistant to change, they are always resistant to change, and she suggested maybe they're just afraid to change or maybe they are just unprepared or not prepared to change instead of the idea of resistance. 

00:15:40
SALLY ST. GEORGE Great, thanks. Some other suggestions, thoughts? 

00:15:45
 One example we thought of was how people will often say they are fighting to stay awake, and so we thought maybe we could use metaphors from exercise like, you know, I have to stretch to be able to do that or I don't know. And then how -- as a compliment often people will say, he killed it or he slayed it, or that just kills me, and I'm trying to think if we -- we did come up with an alternative for that, it was spot on, so directional metaphors. We had a sport metaphor to substitute but it had a violent word in it, knocked it out of the park, so we have to -- we have yet more work to do. 

00:16:30
 I think it would be wonderful if we thought war was not an option or war is obsolete and also that we are all from the universe and that we only think 'we' rather than 'we and them'. As long as it's we and them, we have conflict. But if we're we and all from the universe and war is obsolete, we might have different goals and objectives. 

00:16:55
SALLY ST. GEORGE  Thank you. Well, thanks for doing this with us. We often look at kind of daily practices, whether it's academic daily practices or whether it's just living together kinds of practices, but those are the things that we tend to spend a lot of our time examining. I mean -- and because we live in that zone most of the time, and we also think this is one of the influential areas of our lives as we interact with others. 

00:17:25
DAN WULFF  So we wanted to put you through this exercise not because we have some notion that if you just change the language, you change the behaviors behind it automatically. But it's so often that we use this language, these terms without even thinking about it. So as we become more aware of it, it's kind of like we stop ourselves sometimes in mid sentence realizing that we have used some kind of violent language. So we want to just reflect on is that somehow doing something to me, is that shaping me in some way? In some ways maybe we can live with those words, but to be more deliberate, to be more understanding of the way we are using them and use them deliberately for a certain purpose and not use them mindlessly because we wonder if maybe some of these words used in this kind of everyday mindless way may actually contribute to violence, which is the thing that we are standing against. 

00:18:20
SALLY ST. GEORGE So we thank you for your contributions and for listening and the ideas that you guys have suggested and the things that you have asked us to think about, we will because one of the requests that our families often come into therapy with is we need to have peace and we are here to have you help us get some peace in our family. Thank you very much.
