UNKNOWN And Joanne Koenig Coste. 

00:01:00
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE I was doing about training in nursing homes and assisted living in hospitals and I just wasn't seeing anything that was positive. So I decided to write, "Learning to speak Alzheimer's." All the things I had learned as a, as a care giver, you know, many, many years ago. 

00:01:20

00:01:25
the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break. 

00:01:25
- William Shakespeare 

00:01:35
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE In the days when I was care giving, it was in the early '70s. Nobody had ever heard of Alzheimer's. Dementia was something that we related to older people. The kind of disease that my husband had was called senile dementia which was rather humorous in a way, because he was forty three when he first started showing the science hardly senile. The first Thing that really changed knowing what was happening was one night when we were out for dinner with our best friends and my friend had leaned across the table and she said, "How are you feeling?" Well I was very, pregnant at the time. Our son was actually born the next day and I said to her, "I'm, I'm okay." You know, all things considered, "I'm Okay." And my husband looked at me and he said, "What's the matter with you?" I said, "It's just, we're just talking about the baby that's all, just the baby." And he said, "The baby? I would have thought, you could have told me first." he had forgotten. Grief is such an important part of this and we all do it differently. I think we sort of expect there to be a sort of pattern of how we're supposed to feel and of course, Cooper Ross and others have taught us that there are stages of grief and there certainly are with Alzheimer's. One major difference, most of the grief is done before the person dies. 

00:03:05
Dr. Kenneth Doka 

00:03:05
Senior Consultant to the Hospice Foundation of America 

00:03:05
KENNETH DOKA Grief is a reaction to any kind of loss and no matter what sort of loss you experience whether it's a loss by a death or a loss because a person has significantly changed. Uh… whenever you have an attachment to anything, whenever you experience a loss of that attachment, umm… you experience grief. 

00:03:25
Mary Ellen Geist 

00:03:25
AUTHOR Measure of the Heart; A Father's Alzheimer's, A Daughter's Return 

00:03:25
MARY ELLEN GEIST I think there is a certain amount of grief every day and you have to face that and you can't pretend it's not happening that you're losing the person you love. 

00:03:35
KENNETH DOKA When we experience care giving for someone with Alzheimer's disease, we may not recognize and others may not recognize the grief that is an inherent part of that. What we are grieving are all the losses we've experienced in the course of the illness. And as you cope with that grief, umm… it's important to acknowledge it to yourself even if it's not always being acknowledged in the world around us. 

00:04:00
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE I described myself back in the, in the 70's as a married widow. That's still I think applicable, I, I see so many of the people I counsel who are married widowers and, and married widows. They've lost their person. But, they're still married on the person is still there in a viable part of, of their life. I think that the grief is what sets us free. I think the fear of grief is what keeps us kind of rooted in a, in a sort of negative situation even after we've lost the person.

MARYLYN How did Jerry and I meet? And we need Jerry. 

00:04:45
JERRY Roller skating Rink 

00:04:50
MARYLYN The Rose skating rink. Jerry likes to say, "We've been going around ever since right." So, we've been married since '58, so we're in the marriage quite a while. 

00:05:00
NARRATOR Marylyn and Jerry O'Neill live on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Marylyn is the primary caregiver for Jerry who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 12 years ago. 

00:05:10
MARYLYN In some ways it was harder in the beginning, because it was so unexpected you didn't had to deal with and uh… his emotions were all over the place. That was very hard for both of us, but uh… It sounds crazier that I think it's almost easier now. But the beginning was, the beginning is really rough. 

00:05:30
MARY ELLEN GEIST You begin grieving the loss, I think unfortunately when you get the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. You know, you begin saying goodbye, the long goodbye as they call it. Because, there's no cure, there, it is fatal. 

00:05:45
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Alzheimer's is now the fourth killer of the American population. Isn't that sad? Sad, the saddest part of it is that we look at it with such sadness instead of realizing that these can be some of the best moments we ever gonna have. 

00:06:05
[music] 

00:06:10
Leaving behind the life you knew 

00:06:15
NARRATOR Alzheimer's disease changes lives. As caregivers, we may experience changes such as leaving behind our careers in order to care for a loved one. As the disease progresses, there are often things we used to do that we are no longer able to do. 

00:06:30
MARYLYN One of the things we used to, like to do a lot is take a ride, have a little destination stuff for a hotdog or hamburger or whatever. But we can't do that anymore, that's too far. 

00:06:45
MARY ELLEN GEIST I was really the quintessential career gal. You know, I love my job. I was a reporter, they didn't refer to me as Danger Girl, but they also said to not get in her way. They said like that, I would run people over trying to get to a story. Worked for several radio stations, LA, San Francisco, worked for ABC News got to travel all over the world and you know one awards and really was at the peak of my career. Here I was having this great time in my life and my parents' lives were going downhill, because my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It seemed like my father at the beginning was Okay with it and mother is the one I began worrying about most. Then I was offered a big contract for more years at KGO radio and I just said, "You know, what, I want to go home. I want to go home." When you leave your career, you are getting off the career path, so you're going to lose some of that and traction you had as a career person. But, you also lose the relationships you had as a normal person your age when you go home to live with 2, 80 year old people. I think I didn't take into account some of that, I became this very strange middle aged woman who come home to take care of her father. 

00:08:05
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE When people have to move on from their careers, they have to leave and we're probably talking about 60% of caregivers at some point have to either stop working or get somebody else in to, to do it. There is a tremendous amount of internal resentment and it's not resentment to with the person they're married to, its resentment to the disease. But, resentment is a very negative thing to be carrying around with us day after day and, and unfortunately that's what happens with people who leave their job or lose their job. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Jim, you are new to our group. 

00:08:40
JAMES Yeah, my name is James (inaudible ). I'm also working full time, it's just really tough, you know, she doesn't remember from day to day, where I go, what I do. I'm getting no support from my brother and my family as it, we never talk, it's like we don't exist. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:08:55
NARRATOR In addition to giving up a particular lifestyle or career to care for a family member, caregivers may also become isolated, when other family members and friends show no support. 

00:09:10
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE There are some caregivers who are blessed in having rich families that, that are nurturing and helpful. Unfortunately, that's not every family and the ones that suffer the most are the ones who are isolated, who have no one and it isn't the caregivers need to find somebody who they can say, you know, "Oh! Poor me I'm going through such an awful thing let me tell you what he did today." It's just somebody to talk to. 

00:09:35
NARRATOR Sometimes however, it may not be the best thing to leave a career, job or current lifestyle to care for a family member with Alzheimer's. 

00:09:45
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Sometimes, estrangement happens in the family and it goes on for years. Sometimes the estrangement doesn't happen, but we, we grow old not liking somebody in our family and all of a sudden, we have to be there caregiver. What happens? I think and I think I, I feel strongly about this too that, that should not be the person who is the caregiver. We need to find somebody else. There are times when we need to relinquish care and that's the kindest thing we can do. And if we have a loved one who has been a very nasty young person and middle aged person and been nasty all their life, they're still going to be nasty with Alzheimer's that doesn't change. We have an exaggeration of a previous personality. Why then? Would I give up my life to take care of this person who has never been nice to me in the first place? The family isn't always the best care giver. As a matter of fact in probably 50% of cases, the family isn't the best caregiver. Other people can do it and they can do it well and that means the person who has been estranged can now step back, somebody else can do the care giving 24/7 and I the estranged person can now go and visit and have a nice visit for an hour and leave and have a positive interchange and when the interchange isn't positive, I say goodbye. 

00:11:10
When your loved one forgets who you are 

00:11:15
NARRATOR The pain of having a loved one not recognize you is a great loss. You're caring for them day after day and they may not know who you are. Allow yourself to acknowledge that this is heartbreaking. 

00:11:25
KENNETH DOKA One of the useful terms in the field is chronic sorrow and what that means is that you live with this constant sense of grief that frequently spikes at various times. So for example, your daughter comes with your granddaughter or your grandson and your spouse doesn't recognize either of those persons and that kind of adds to that sense of, how could he not know who these people are? How could we have lost this, this, this connection so important to me? And so you live with this perpetual sense of sorrow. 

00:12:00
MARY ELLEN GEIST So when I first came home, I was like, this is going to be so great and I'm going to take care of my dad and I realized he didn't know my name. And when he needed me, he knew who I was, but when he needed me he would shout, "Daughter, where are you? And that's heartbreaking. 

00:12:15
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE I came home from grocery shopping and I put all the groceries down and my husband looked at me and he said, "You really look good today." And I said, "Oh, thank you, thank you so much." That was wonderful and I looked at the groceries and, and he said, "No. I, I mean it. You, you look terrific." "Thank you." He said, "I really think you should get out of here before my wife comes home." And I said, "Okay. I will. It was nice to see you." And I went out the front door and I was dying, I was dying. I thought, "Oh! No, no." I knew nothing. I didn't know what to be prepared for, so I came in the back door and I said, "Charlie I'm home." And he said, "Oh! Thank heavens. Thank heavens. We had visitors." And I said, "Okay, I'm, I'm home now." And then I realized that every time I came in, I said, you know, "Hi Charlie, it's Joanne. I'm home." 

00:13:15
Take time to stop and think about how to turn painful situations into moments of discovery. 

00:13:20
MARY ELLEN GEIST We're driving in a car together, having the best time singing and he said, "So glad you're here. Are you the oldest one?" And it was this shock and I told him, "He was going to lose it." And I didn't want my dad to see that I was going to cry and I realized that he knew I was his daughter. But he didn't know which one and then I thought you know what, I am going to turn this around. And this is, and from that moment I did it every time. I said, "No Dad you know, I'm not the oldest one. I'm the middle one." And you know what, and I proceeded to tell him my life story and it was this amazing thing that happened, because he said, "Really?" I said, "Yes, I went to (inaudible )college and you sent me there." He said, "I did?" And he was so happy. 

00:14:10
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE There is pain and certainly associated with your loved one when they forget your name and it's going to happen in a 100% of cases if the person lives long enough. They will at some point forget your name, they will forget the relationship, but they never forget that you were a person who belongs to them. They never forget that. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
The loss of the person you once knew 

00:14:45
MARILYN Okay Jerry, I think you'd maybe go to the bathroom before (inaudible ). 

00:14:50
NARRATOR Alzheimer's gradually takes away the person that you know and love. As the disease progresses, we find ourselves having to do things for our loved one that we never would have dreamed of having to do. 

00:15:00
MARILYN Put your feet out, put your feet out. 

00:15:05
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Most difficult thing about losing a spouse, you've lost your partner. You've lost the person who is your conversationalist. You've lost the person who you can put your cold feet on at night you've lost intimacy. The thing that people tell me the most is the, the loss of communication. They want to come home and say, "Guess what so, what our grandchild did today?" And there's nobody to talk to. When I know what the stock market is nobody to talk to? 

00:15:35
MARILYN Being unable to, to talk about a lot of things. You know, (inaudible )out together, the hardest thing was just not to able to communicate a lot, this much. 

00:15:45
NARRATOR The moments when we realize that a loved one is no longer that person we used to know, our moments of grief. 

00:15:55
MARY ELLEN GEIST We went out to big dinner one night and he'd been doing quite well going out to dinner. But when you go out to dinner and a waitress comes up and says, you know, "What would you like?" And you realize, he can't order. Then you have to order for him and then you make the mistake of ordering something like steak which he doesn't know, you know, when you realize he's looking around and he doesn't know how to use a fork and a knife and, and you realize that these moments are like that can't be my father. 

00:16:20
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE The most difficult thing I think with living with an Alzheimer's person is the loss of, of someone I used to love and knowing that I still love this person, but feeling odd about it because this is not the person, it's a different person. This person is inhabiting my loved one's body that, that's what it's happening and, and frequently this happens with parents, when it's a parent and a child relationship and the parent has Alzheimer's. It is incredibly difficult for the child to have this complete role reversal with they're now the parent and the person with Alzheimer's has become the child and it's not one that we are ever taught how to do. 

00:17:05
MARILYN Yeah, that was as I say, February 1st, 1958, we were married in New Jersey. Really doesn't seem that long ago. Just on his, his bad days when umm… he gets more confused and is more uh… with John, that makes me sad, because that's not really like him. But I try not to go on that rollercoaster, because he get, he get bad days and I'd say, "Oh, my god. Here we go." And then, then he would come back and he'll have good days. So you can't go too up with the good days and too down with the bad days because the bad days can make me uh… can make me feel really sad. 

00:17:55
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Then one more time, the difficulty with Alzheimer's is this ongoing, insidious progressive loss of someone we once knew and yet they still look the same, they still walk the same, they still smell the same, they're not the same person. They're someone else. How do I identify? I have to start now retraining myself to identify this new person, but I don't want this new person. I want the old one. I want my mother back, I want my dad, I want my husband, I want my brother, my sister. I don't want this, this loss to happen and it's an incredibly difficult, because it's insidious. 

00:18:40
NARRATOR As well as losing the person we used to know through Alzheimer's, sometimes we see aspects of the person we never saw before. 

00:18:45
KENNETH DOKA I remember dealing with one daughter who was very proud of her mother, her mother was… was a very progressive person uh… from the south and as she progressed into the disease, she began to use terminology, she began to use words that, that she would never use in her, in her conscious moments and it troubled the daughter and she began to say, "Well, who was my mother really?" Umm… you know, the genteel progressive that I knew doesn't seem to be this woman who's here now. So sometimes you may really experience even a loss of identity uh… who was this person? Uh… it, it's not the person I knew. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN One of his favorite things say almost on a daily basis is, I'm sure that Alzheimer's isn't progressive and I'm biting my tongue. He will sit in the chair, you know, watching television, he can't absorb whatever he is, he is watching. And he sits over here there's a table between this and I'm sitting here and I can see out of the corner of my eye, he is sitting there staring at me. Now, many years ago I might have been flattered, it's kind of creeping me out. 

00:20:05
MARILYN Be right up Jerry. Okay? 

00:20:05
NARRATOR Alzheimer's disease gradually takes away the person we once knew. The disease also takes away the ability of our loved one to be able to relate in our world. There are points in our grief journey where we need to let go. 

00:20:20
MARY ELLEN GEIST That was the hardest thing is the decline of, you know, his memory to the point that he didn't know where he was and he didn't know who he was. And music was the only thing at one point he said, he wanted to be closer to music and he would stand next to the speakers and he'd say, "I want to get in there." And one point we unscrewed the speakers and we brought it down and we put it on his lap and he held the speaker like he was holding a child. And at that point I think, the only thing he was connecting to was music and that was the weird thing too because I realized then that he wasn't really connecting to us anymore. And at a certain point you have to let go. 

00:21:00
[music] 

00:21:05
Denial, anger, and guilt as a part of grief 

00:21:10
NARRATOR There are times when we choose denial, because we want so much to have the person back that we used to know and we don't want this reality that we're now living in. 

00:21:20
MARY ELLEN GEIST So let's go out to lunch, you know, or dinner and I take him to this place nearby where they knew it and they like, they'd see us coming and my dad was just shuffling and he was just very skeletal at that point. But I want to take him out you know, and I brought him in and again this is about denial, because I'm like it'll all be fine. And we'll all go to dinner and he'll remember how to eat and everything will be fine. And we walk in and once he walked in and he like he said, "I'm dead." And he fell, he laid down on the floor and all the people in the restaurant came running and I mean, okay, it was a little crazy. and I think that's typical, it's because you want so much. You want to bring the person back, you want to be alive again. You think I can't find him in there somewhere, you know, that's the denial definitely. 

00:22:00
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE We have to have denial when our feet are the most firmly planted, never know if that makes any sense or not. It's kind of counter-intuitive, but we do. We think this, this isn't happening, he's going to be better tomorrow. I even had Charley stand on his head, because I thought of the oxygen got there maybe he'd do better. That was, that was denial, you know. And I applaud our caregivers who once in a while do some, some things. I have care givers asking me all the time, "What do you think about chocolate ice cream in (inaudible )?" I read an article that says and I'll go for it. You know what the heck's here? That's denial and, and when we know what is, if the denial gets in the way however of moving on and treating the things that need to be treated. Then we've got a problem and we need to do something about it. It serves a purpose with firmly planted feel for a short period of time. 

00:23:00
MARY ELLEN GEIST Sometimes when we be dressing him up, I'm like, "Why are we doing this?" We are, you know, dressing up this person that doesn't even know how to put on his clothes. But then you are, "No, it's going to be great and he's going to go perform and…" And I think every day I thought some magic would occur and my dad would come back and you know what's weird is? Sometimes he did. Sometimes he remembered everything, he remembered what was and those moments, you know, you're like and you're hungry for them. You know, it's, and he'd remember something, "Oh! I remember when we did this." And you're like, "Oh, yes, my dad's back." 

00:23:40
NARRATOR Guilt and anger are also aspects of grief to be aware of when caring for a loved one with also Alzheimer's disease. 

00:23:50
KENNETH DOKA There can be a tremendous amount of anger and then a tremendous amount of guilt and we frequently oscillate between those two emotions. It's very time consuming, it's very tedious, it's very difficult. Sometimes it's easy to feel that the person you're working with is not cooperating with you. Now, you know that's not the case, but you still get angry at the person uh… and then you feel guilty about it. "How could I lose my temper." And sometimes we just have to realize, this is an extraordinarily stressful situations. And the truth is extraordinary stressful situations don't bring out the best of us. 

00:24:25
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Every caregiver has the right to be angry. They have the right to be angry. They don't have the right to be angry all the time. But they have the right to be, have moments of anger, because in real life without Alzheimer's, we all have moments of, of anger, upset, different degrees for, for different people. Why wouldn't we as caregivers, it's okay, you have permission to be angry. Why wouldn't you be? Angry at the disease, not angry at the person and I think those are, are two very different things. 

00:25:00
NARRATOR You may regret her feel guilty about things you do or don't do and say while caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. 

00:25:05
MARY ELLEN GEIST There's an incredible amount of guilt. It's really funny, you know, when it kicked in when you're having a really great time and you're gone from him like I knew I needed a break. And so I went up north and I was having this great time and you're laughing and talking and then you remember that your father is suffering at home. 

00:25:25
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE And we feel guilt, because we know somebody else who did it better than we did and should I have taken the time yesterday. I should've watched Oprah, I should have been with my loved one. We could find a million things to feel guilty about. If the guilt takes over, we're in trouble. 

00:25:40
KENNETH DOKA As caregivers, umm… we cannot uh… hold ourselves responsible for doing everything always correctly at the right moment. Umm… part of being a caregiver means learning how to forgive yourself. 

00:26:00
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE It's when these emotions take the best of us, when they're, when guilt and denial and, and the other emotions that run along with it. Take hold of how we are as caregivers that we need help, we need help, we need to find some other resources and sources to get through this. 

00:26:20
Dangers of grief 

00:26:25
NARRATOR The grief that we experience during our care of a loved one with Alzheimer's can become so heavy that it puts us and our loved ones in danger. 

00:26:35
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE And there is a huge danger in grief if the person we are caring for knows we are grieving. I think that is the biggest danger of all and it can happen. It can happen time and time again. It's happening right now, it's happening in nursing homes, daughters are coming in to see "Mom…" this is, reside the bed weeping. Mom knows something is wrong even in the final stages. I'm talking about when somebody is being fed, when they no longer verbal, when they might be a bad patient, they still are tuned in to what the emotions are around them and grief is the emotion that carries us away. It… it's over powering and it's visible, that's a huge danger. 

00:27:20
NARRATOR There is danger in grief when it begins to affect your health. 

00:27:25
KENNETH DOKA There are real physical dangers with care giving. And… umm… and so you should always monitor your health and… and you should always make sure, if you're very… very tired, if you find your immune system is down, you're getting colds very frequently. This is a good time to, to really take care of yourself in this process and to make sure that you are doing well. Umm… you can care for somebody else half speed. 

00:27:50
NARRATOR As caregivers, we often feel guilty about asking for help or feel that no one can handle our loved one like we care. These feelings put us in danger of burnout. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN I can't expect people to command. I mean, to me, it is a, it is a, it is a job and for them to, to put up with what they would have to put up with. I, I Just… 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Wrong… wrong 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Well, I mean… 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN No, of course not, no. You need to learn to yes, ask and yes, allow. 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN But I can't do that. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yes, you can. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN You try it once and you'll find you can right. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Yes, you will. 

00:28:35
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE People will call and say, "Is there anything I can do?" And almost every care giver on earth says, "No, I'm okay. Everything's fine." Inside they're thinking, "Oh, yes. Yes." They need to say, "Yes!" Yeah, there is something you could do. Could you come over Tuesday and, and sit with Jim, while I go to the hairdresser. Anything, they need to be able to say, "Yes." 

00:29:00
KENNETH DOKA I can't overemphasize the, the need for respite. You can't take care of another individual if you're not taking good care of yourself. And of course, many times we see people who are caregivers, who end up being hospitalized because they, they don't follow the simple rules of self care. Umm… so again, acknowledge your grief, acknowledge the stress that you're under and say, "How can I cope best with my laws? How can I cope with my stress, and how can I take care of myself? That's the only way you're going to be an effective caregiver.

Care for yourself first 

00:29:50
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Typical story is, Garret and MJ who live out in western Massachusetts and Alzheimer's has come into their… their family and one night Garry got out of bed six times came downstairs, he walked around, picked up a glass of milk that was on the counter. It had been there for three days. He went back up into bed, came down, the last time he came down he walked outside. It was 21˚ out and he had bare feet. And out went Garry and he started piling wood that his son had chopped down for him a tree and he piled, and he pile and until the sun came up. And he walked back into the house and MJ coming down the stairs and, and she saw him come in and she ran over and put her arms around him and said, "Oh my darling." And here's the rub. Garry does not have Alzheimer's, MJ does, Garry is burning out from the act of loving like thousands of caregivers across the country are right now. Burning out from the act of loving, if there hadn't been an intervention at that time, Garry would not be with us. Now he's still with us eighteen pounds heavier and with lots of help during the day he's got volunteers coming in he's got some paid help but he realized that's what he needed to do. 

00:31:10
MARY ELLEN GEIST You have to get out you have to leave, I can't stress enough to people and remember who you are not attached to that person. And taking care of some of the Alzheimer's, it is exhausting women friends can step in if you're a woman and men friends can step in if you're a man and say, "We're going on a golf trip we're going to go do this." Get away if you possibly can and you'll remember like, who you are. 

00:31:25
KENNETH DOKA Take care of yourself and take care of yourself also means getting respite from it. That can be hard when you're care giving for somebody with Alzheimer's, because we often feel that nobody can take care of the person like we can. But again, sometimes it helps just to, much like you did maybe at the very beginning of life when you had a child, umm… where you, maybe let somebody watch them for an hour until you felt a little bit more confident. Then you went out for a night, you need to find that same respite as you deal with Alzheimer's care giving. 

00:32:00
MARY ELLEN GEIST We finally got someone to come help in the home and I'll never forget the first day she got there. She sat here, my mother sat here and my dads sat here and I'm like, "Mom, you're supposed to leave, because we hired someone to take care of dad. She would not, she want to stay by her side. She couldn't imagine leaving. She couldn't imagine giving up her role as a caregiver. To get away for an hour or two hours, it just, it dint change your whole life, it changes your perspective. You have to get away. You have to see friends. You can't give up everything for care giving. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Now, she is going to do her exercises. 

00:32:35
MARILYN Yeah, just you can lean on the bed, it feels good. 

00:32:40
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Most important thing of all is that, no matter how difficulty it is, be selfish and take care of you, take care of you. Well, there won't be any one to take care of the people who… who we love, who we do care about. 

00:32:50
MARILYN Thank you very much. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Oh, you are welcome. 

00:32:50
MARILYN Thank you. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Yes, have a big day. 

00:32:55
MARILYN Bye. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN How are you doing? Bye. 

00:33:00
MARILYN You know, I kinda got that three days a week, I get meals on wheels. So, Jerry can eat it, but it's a help me for me to one night. Three nights I don't have to think about it and my self. Usually, he's up and he had some breakfast and this can't change somewhat. And then the home health cares, they come at different times. Today, it was 8:30, Wednesdays 8 o'clock. I have a lot of back issues, spine issues, so it eliminates so much of the bending and work for me when he takes a sponge or takes a shower. So it's a godsend. And then sometimes I use that time just to run out to the store or do something like that or take a shower or whatever. So, that's really a, a help. And then once a week I get three hours respite, that's through elder services. so I get a three hour respite, but that was yesterday. So umm… that's, that's a nice block of time to do whatever you have to do. Right? 

00:34:00
JERRY Yeah! 

00:34:00
MARILYN Or even to meet a friend sometimes to have a cup of coffee or something or so. Well, that, that's too, it's a godsend. 

00:34:10
Reach out 

00:34:15
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE The most important stage of grief is that when we say, "I need a support group. I need somebody to talk to." Because that's I think, when it's really acceptance when we're saying you know, I need someone. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Greatest gift this group gave me was a long progression of disease which is incredible insights, incredible direction. All we are doing is sharing our experiences that we're learning from one another, that for me is the greatest gift. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN And you all know that when you come in here, you need to cry your cry. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN oh yeah, I know that. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN The day you get mad and say, "I'm second time in doing this." You can say that too, because you are. There are days where you are so overwhelmed and there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN I'm Second time. 

00:35:10
MARILYN You make a lot of friends there, you do, you, right Jerry? 

00:35:10
JERRY Yeah 

00:35:10
MARILYN And it's, it's a place where you can speak openly and then when you leave, you say, "I can do this." 

00:35:25
Alzheimer's Association 1-800-272-3900 

00:35:25
MARY ELLEN GEIST There are free Alzheimer's Association, counseling groups you can go to. It's absolutely wonderful. You can just go and talk, a support group and it makes all the difference in the world. And there's also an 800 number for the Alzheimer's Association that I have called at 3 in the morning. I'm like, just going to lose it because my dad is like doing something weird or I can't get him in the shower or something and you can just talk to someone at this Alzheimer's Association, 800 number and just a human being will be on the other line. 

00:35:50
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Caregivers will burn out and at a tremendous rate if they don't learn to take care of themselves and I don't think anybody can do this all alone. We all need somebody. 

00:36:00
MARY ELLEN GEIST I really urge people to talk with people, get counseling, go to support groups and also who can't do it anymore and you have to have someone else take care of your loved one. Don't feel guilty about it. Not everyone can do it. 

00:36:15
Working with change 

00:36:25
NARRATOR Change occurs on a daily basis for caregivers and loved ones living with Alzheimer's disease. This constant state of change can overwhelm us if we don't learn to work with it. 

00:36:40
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE From diagnosis on nothing's ever going to be normal. Again, we can work towards making things as simple and as pleasant and is as much like the way we would have planned as possible. But, we're not going to be able to go on, on the trips and… and retire with the grandchildren and, and do those kinds of things. All our friends are, they're the normal ones. We're not, we don't feel a sense of, of normalcy that all the more that underscores the fact that we need to have that kind of support system that makes us feel as normal as we possibly can. And that means having the help, the support that allows us to take care of ourselves. That allows us to go to the library or to get our hair done or to get a manicure or to go to the barber shop or to a ballgame whatever it is, because those are the normal things in our lives. We can't do them unless we have the help that allows us to do them. 

00:37:40
MARY ELLEN GEIST That can be just the most lonely task, being alone with someone taking care of them growing heartbreaking task. Just throw out normal. You know, and at 5 o'clock put on Frank Sinatra, dance around the room if the person you're taking care of can dance, sing music, read poetry to that person, tell the story of your Life to that person. You don't have to do things the way society says to do them. 

00:38:05
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Imagine living with unpredictability 27/7, that's what our caregivers are doing. That's what they're doing and all we can teach them to try to do is to get used to one change at a time. Knowing that tomorrow is going to bring another one and we'll get used to that one, at that time adjusting to one at a time. 

00:38:30
NARRATOR As we deal with constant change during our care giving, often we can lose perspective on things that are important. 

00:38:35
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE I'm So reminded by a time in another life when I had bought a pair of new white kid sneakers and I was, I just love them. I put on my white kids and immediately spilled ketchup all over my right sneakers and I was just, "Oh! No. I just bought these." I felt so awful and, and my husband even entering into the disease had enough presence of mind to look at me and he looked at the sneaker and he said, "Are you playing at Wimbledon tomorrow?" And what he was saying to me was, "How important? It's a sneaker." You know, what wonderful training that puts for me to become an, an Alzheimer's partner. It was great training. It's putting things in perspective. How important is it? This is a fatal illness we're dealing with. Let's make it the best we can and of that six Oreos, twelve times a day, go for it. 

00:39:35
NARRATOR Change gives us the opportunity to think creatively. 

00:39:35
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE I walked into the kitchen one night, my husband's holding of my brand new Teflon frying pan in one hand and he had an SOS scouring pad on the other and I thought never the twain should meet. I went back 15 minutes later, he had taken all the Teflon off the frying pan. It was shiny stainless steel. My heart dropped and then I looked at his face and he was waving and I said, "Oh, that is so beautiful. Look at that pan." I went in the other room and said, "Oh, my heavens." I went out the next day and bought two more of Teflon pans. One for me, I hid it and another one for him so that he could do something that he felt was positive and wonderful. 

00:40:20
MARY ELLEN GEIST Very hard for him to give up driving and so and he said, "Why can't I drive?" And I'm like, "Dad, you can't." And it was very hard. And it made, he used to He's a car guy, he was president of a company that sold parts to the big three and I'm like, "Wow, can we do this." So we're going to Wal-Mart, because they have those carts. And we went in and he sat down in those motorized shopping carts and he just gets in there and I would ride to next to him and we'd two drive Wal-Mart together. we were okay with making other people uncomfortable and we just decided that we were going to do that and we're all going to be like kind of crazy together, because for the moments that you get out of that. 

00:41:00
Communicate 

00:41:05
MARY ELLEN GEIST Never give up communicating with someone. I met this woman who's studying music therapy and she played the violin. And one of her assignment was to go to a nursing home and they just said, "Well, you know, go play in for 15 minutes here and just take a violin and work with people." And she was working with people in various stages of dementia and Alzheimer's in nursing home. And I said, "Well there's Leila down the hall, but you know wouldn't do any good." And she's, you know, we think she's been in a coma just lying in bed unable to speak or do anything, but you might as well get on their employer for her. So for two weeks she went in every day at the end of that time she wanted to find time and played for this woman and she was just, Who was lying there. And she said, "Well, Leila, I've enjoyed playing you know, violin for you these past two weeks, but this is my last day and she reached out and took her hand and a tear came out of her eye." And that's there's something about that that just really moves me. It's like, there's always the possibility of communication. 

00:42:05
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE these people are losing their language. That's what they're losing. They're losing their ability to communicate. So we have to be the best communicators we can be it's got nothing to do with words, nothing to do with words at all. It has everything to do with the emotions. You know one of the beautiful things with Alzheimer's and there are, there are some really neat things that happen with this disease, but one of them happens to be that emotions stays intact. It's not gone. It, everything else changes, not emotion. It's grown up, it's mature, it's the same as it would have been without Alzheimer's. We can reach the person on their emotional level. 

00:42:45
MARILYN He likes to laugh so just, just being silly like different things, I think that helps a lot. 

00:42:55
NARRATOR As our loved one loses their ability to communicate with this through words, it's important to remember that through body like we can communicate a lot to them. 

00:43:05
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE The story that I share every single time I have a chance to, to share it is the night that I asked my husband to sit down for dinner and he didn't. And I said again you know, "Sit down. We're good we're going to eat." The children are at the table. I was bringing the food, high chair was flipping, he was just standing there. And I said, "Will you sit down?" And as the times, the number of times I asked him increased, so did my anger and I knew, I knew, I finally got to the point where I said to him. "Will you just sit down, because I love you." What better reason, you know, we say that to children it works. Do it, because I love you. Don't ask, just do it. Do it, because I love you. And he looked at me and he said, "Oh, your eyes don't." My eyes didn't love him is what he was saying. My eyes didn't love him and I thought at that moment that is never going to happen again, never. And I realize that, my body language was every bit as important as what his was. What his emotion was, what was my, what was my emotion. Because you know what, he was right. At that moment, I was not feeling love. I was not and yet I was trying to convey love to him. Not the way to do it. 

00:44:30
Living in the moment and accepting this new person 

00:44:35
[music] 

00:44:40
NARRATOR To live in each moment and to accept this new person our loved one has become through Alzheimer's is something that we must learn to do as caregivers. 

00:44:50
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE It's normal for us to look in the past. It's a very normal thing for us to do. We surround ourselves with, with photographs and memorable year of, of past years. And now all of a sudden, we have to sort of not think about the past and think about, how am I going to make this moment the best it can be? We got to be where they are. 

00:45:10
MARY ELLEN GEIST When I first came home, one of the most depressing times was meal time and I think that's when it became so clear to me that my father was not the father he was before. I mean, put the food in front of him and he said, "Oh! I can't eat that. I can't eat that." I'm like, "Dad." It was very frustrating. I found this book learning how to speak Alzheimer's which I absolutely love and umm… she said, you know, why do we insist that they eat the way we eat? Someone has Alzheimer's, they forgot how to use a knife and fork. Accept the new person that this person is now and don't keep trying to go back to the person they used to be. 

00:45:50
NARRATOR As caregivers of parents often we find it hard to accept how our parent has changed and how dependent they've become on us to help them. 

00:46:00
KENNETH DOKA But we have to reach a kind of notion of what we might call umm… Generational maturity that we recognize our parents are neither the awesome or awful people of our youth that we recognize that they were vulnerable, that we recognize, they have needs and that we may sometimes be able to, to help them achieve those needs. And we recognize their dependency uh… and understand that, that changes our relationship. Whenever someone is ill, particularly when someone is ill with dementia, uh… we find that we always have to renegotiate who we are in relationship to them and what we do in relationship to them? 

00:46:45
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Love the person who exists now. A different person? Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! But the basic person is still there and they still need is… 

00:47:00
Encouragement 

00:47:00
Courage doesn't always roar. 

00:47:00
Sometimes courage is a quiet voice at the end of the day saying, "I will try again tomorrow." 

00:47:00
- Mary Anne Radmacher 

00:47:10
NARRATOR Through your journey with Alzheimer's disease, if you recognize your losses, embrace your feelings about them and allow yourself to grieve. You can live a life of meaning and purpose during the time remaining with your loved one. 

00:47:25
KENNETH DOKA There are joy's to care giving. Umm… uh… sometimes, we're surprised at the strength we have. Umm… sometimes were amazed at the, the love we can show. Sometimes we have joy in the support of people who we never realized would be as supportive as they are. Umm… sometimes these joys may be hard to find, uh… but just there, as there are a burdens to care giving, umm… there are sometimes gifts that come with care giving. 

00:47:50
MARY ELLEN GEIST I think it takes great courage and it takes great sacrifice to this. Take great pride in it, because it's one of the best things you can possibly do. 

00:48:00
JOANNE KOENIG COSTE Let's always remember this no matter how they change and no matter how their, their exterior is different. The good stuff is on the inside and its still there, and that's where the treasure are, and they don't go away. 

00:48:20
MARY ELLEN GEIST I just gave a lecture in Michigan for caregivers. It was care giving day and I saw this woman get out of van and I saw her shoulders just go… you know, the exhaustion. She was like 80, taking the wheelchair out of the back and folding the wheelchair, going up alone and trying to get her husband out and get him in to the wheel chair. I said, "Do you need some help?" And she said, "No." She came in and I thought, I'm here to try to help these care givers feel better." And so I got up at the podium and I had my speech all planned out and I just threw the speech aside and I said, you know, I came here today and I described what I saw and I said I want to point to you. And I saw you what you did, I Want to commend you for the work you do and I said all of the caregivers here stand up and we all clapped and everybody just cried. I wanna say thank you to all the caregivers thank you to all the caregivers who take care of the people with Alzheimer's like my dad.
