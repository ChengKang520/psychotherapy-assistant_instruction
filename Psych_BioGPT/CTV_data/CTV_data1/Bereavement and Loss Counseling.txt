00:00:40
A personal request 

00:00:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH This session with Kate where she talks about her quite overwhelming losses was quite a profound session for me. In it, I felt that we really did connect and I sensed someone who is really quite beautiful and was in a great deal of pain and I felt deeply touched at that moment around, uh, towards the end of the session. So, when you watch this session, I don't know, it feels a little bit like something quite private and, in a way, I suppose I would like you to watch it with respect. 

00:01:50

00:01:50
Counselling session 

00:01:50
A few minutes into the session 

00:01:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, Kate, um, we talked about quite a few things but decided that the most important thing was to focus on the recent losses that you've experienced. 

00:02:20
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:02:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, uh, in particular, the loss of your mother about a year ago, just over a year ago. 

00:02:25
KATE Yes. 

00:02:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then the loss of a partner in the, uh, September...(crosstalk) 

00:02:30
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:02:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then another kind of loss, uh, with your father moving into a home in the, in January. 

00:02:40
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:02:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Moving out there for a while to be with him. 

00:02:45
KATE Yes. 

00:02:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then having to, um, deal with the, the house, the home and, uh, as he, as he moved into a home and clearing his home. 

00:02:55
KATE Yes and, and selling it. 

00:03:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, and selling it. So, really, uh, an enormous amount of loss to cope with, to have to deal with in, in a relatively short time. 

00:03:10
KATE Mm-hmm, yeah, that's what it's felt like. 

00:03:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

00:03:15
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's one thing at a time might have been all right but just the combination has been really difficult. 

00:03:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And so, how have you been? Coping or not coping? 

00:03:35
KATE Um, I've been very tired. And, um, I think I coped with my mother initially fine because she was 88. She wanted to, she wanted to go and I was, kind of, happy for her that she went as easily as she did. So, it almost didn't seem like there was any reason to mourn, um...(crosstalk) 

00:04:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Was it, um, her death, something that you had time to prepare for, or was it sudden? 

00:04:15
KATE No, it happened very quickly in the end. 

00:04:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Okay. 

00:04:15
KATE Yeah, it was unexpected for everybody. 

00:04:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Right. 

00:04:20
KATE Um, she, she was only in hospital for 12 hours. Um, she had an infection that just spread round her body and, um, she left. And I was driving back from the other side of the country to try and get to be with her, um; so, it was the morning, it was harbor's(inaudible) day, one morning that I realized, well, my brother called to say that she was not well, she'd been taken into hospital. And my father called and told me and, um, neither of them thought she was dying, but I tuned in to her, felt her and I thought, actually, she's dying, I have to go now. So, I packed the car and got in the car but I was in the west country and, um, they live on the east coast, so it was an awful long way to drive. So, I, I thought I just have to drive as hard as I can, um, but four hours into the drive, en-, energetically, I felt her leave and, um, I knew she died. And so, I knew the next thing that would happen would be my brother calling to say that she died and that is what happened. So, I just, I, he called and I said, ‘Yes, I know,’ and, um, asked him to tell the nursing staff in hospital that I wanted to go and see her. So I just drove the rest of the way home and, um, I went to see her body to say good-bye to her body. And that was the first time I'd seen anybody having passed, so I would choose that, I would choose my mom as the first time, and, uh, but it was good to say good-bye. Yeah. It was. It seems to have got harder than easier the more the time's gone by. 

00:06:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, at first, it seemed okay. She was 88 and she was ready to go but now, as you're talking, clearly you're very upset. 

00:06:50
KATE Yes. Um, we didn't have an easy relationship when I was a child and so since I was 18 I've always lived at least 100 miles away from home. Um, cause we didn't seem to be able to talk, so I wasn't, I, I would say I wasn't close to my mom. But, um, she was my mom, so whatever life was like when she, she and I were together, I miss her. I really miss her now, which is almost a surprise cause I've been a very independent woman. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:40
KATE I have to use one of these. 

00:07:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That's what they're for, there for. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then, just a few months later... 

00:08:15
KATE Yes, and then in September, it was necessary for me to end a relationship that I'd had with a man that I'd loved for 11 years. And, um, I don't need to go into the details why, but I had to call a halt to it. And, um, that was, been one of the hardest things I've had to do. And, um, I miss him enormously. That has been very, very painful. So I thought in many ways that I was missing, I was mourning him more than, or mourning the loss of the relationship, more than, um, more than my mom, but maybe it's all just got tangled up together. 

00:09:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Well, it sounds like there's a lot of feelings about different people in a relatively short time. 

00:09:15
KATE Mm-mm. 

00:09:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Feelings of loss can also get tangled up with other feelings of loss earlier in life too. It can be, the whole thing can, kind of, get very mixed up into it. Cause you've said there that, um, earlier, just now you were talking about your mother and how you'd moved away and that you weren't that close to her. 

00:09:35
KATE No. 

00:09:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So maybe there's also issues there about, um, the loss of the mother that you could've had, uh, but didn't. 

00:09:45
KATE Yes, I thought, I thought for many years I had the wrong mother. She wasn't a mother I could ever talk to. And, um, my father I adored but he was a very remote figure, you know, he was working very hard and cared for us...(crosstalk) 

00:10:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH When you say was, though, he hasn't actually, he hasn't passed away? 

00:10:10
KATE No, he's not died, he's, he's, he's 90 now, um, it's just that he too is not the man he was. 

00:10:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So there there's a sense of the person you knew has gone. 

00:10:20
KATE Yes, really. 

00:10:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The person you knew, adored as your father...(crosstalk) 

00:10:25
KATE Yes. 

00:10:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Isn't there anymore. 

00:10:30
KATE No, not really. Only he's struggling, cause he's now living in a home and he's struggling. He, he's lost his life partner. They were together for 68 years and he's lost his physical health and he's living in a strange place, strange to him and he's lost his independence and he's lost, he's losing his faculties. It's a really hard time for him. And, um, but it's like he's turned to me now and I guess there's some kind of role reversal that he needs, he needs me and my support now, which he, he's never needed before. Cause his focus was always on mom. 

00:11:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So you were always remote. 

00:11:20
KATE Yes. 

00:11:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now that, in a sense, he's become this other person or has grown, has become so old that he's no longer who he was, that that's changed too. 

00:11:30
KATE Yes. 

00:11:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH There's a real need on his side for you. 

00:11:40
KATE Mm-mm. And he said, um, I think that it's time I went back to see him because I stayed with him for two and a half months to see him through the transition, but then I had to go back to my life. Though, when I went back again he talked about feeling abandoned and at a, kind of, intellectual level, I completely understood, but actually at an emotional level I was so angry. I had this huge response, which was, ‘Oh, really, that's a fine one. You abandoned me a long time ago, so now you know what it feels like.’ That was the reaction that I had. 

00:12:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So almost a bit vengeful as well. 

00:12:35
KATE Well, it, it sounds like it but I didn't really, it didn't last as a vengeful feeling, but it was there. Uh, it just feels like, like some, you know, he, kind of, left a long time ago. 

00:12:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And loss isn't just about grief, it's also about anger and also about fear. So, anger can be there for other reasons too, you know, for that there's a genuine, there's a good reason to be angry because he, he did abandon you a long time ago. At the same time, the feeling when you lose somebody it's not just grief, there's also anger and often the anger gets, uh, pushed to one side. 

00:13:25
KATE Mm-hmm. Right. Excuse me. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:35
KATE Yeah...(crosstalk) 

00:13:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Could you use another one? 

00:13:35
KATE ...I can see that. Okay. Thank you. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I mean, my, my overall feeling is just, like, this is so much. It's, like, completely emotionally boggling and mind boggling; it's emotionally boggling to have so much in such a short period of time. Must be really, it must have been really, you know, almost like these different shocks coming in, the losses coming in, one after the other. It must have been very, um, devastating then. 

00:14:30
KATE Mm-hmm. It has been and it's, um, kind of, flattened my physical energy. It's been, it's been hard to, sort of, do what I normally do easily. Um, I've been struggling. 

00:14:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Would you expect to be able to do what you normally do? 

00:14:55
KATE Yes. 

00:14:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Really? That...(crosstalk) 

00:15:00
KATE Normally. 

00:15:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...makes no sense at all. 

00:15:00
KATE No, but it's just, um, a life pattern. Being able to, um, I, uh, my father, as well, is just, kind of, um, well I don't know what you call it, stoicism or something, of just being able to deal with it, get on. 

00:15:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, what would be a, a different way, a kinder way of, um, looking at yourself now? 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
KATE I, well, I guess it's just, it's about acknowledging what has happened and that actually that amount of loss in that amount of time is, is a l ot to deal, for anybody to deal with. So, um, the word that came into my head, head was compassion. That I probably need some compassion for myself. 

00:16:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Compassion, yeah, and a, and a lot of caring. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:10
KATE Yeah. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:20
KATE And if it feels so easy when you live on your own. 

00:16:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It, it feels so easy? 

00:16:25
KATE No, it doesn't feel so easy. 

00:16:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH No. 

00:16:30
KATE Uh, for somebody, as I do live on my own, is cause, like, you have to just get on and do what you have to do. 

00:16:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Since September or before then or? 

00:16:40
KATE Oh, just always. Well, since I've lived on my own, I guess. 

00:16:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, when you split up with your partner, you weren't living together? 

00:16:45
KATE No. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, you've lived alone for, for quite a long time. 

00:16:55
KATE Yeah, for a number of years. Um, I've lost count really, but probably about 12 years now. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And again, it is, it is difficult when you're on your own. 

00:17:10
KATE Yeah, it's tougher. 

00:17:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Cause there isn't someone there to be caring. 

00:17:15
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:17:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Be a friend, be... So, that's another reason to be even more compassionate towards yourself. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
KATE Mm-hmm. I suppose it is. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Could you say a bit more about the flattened, I think you used the word flattened, that you've been flattened by it. 

00:17:55
KATE Um, I, just a sense of, um, a loss of energy, of being, um, well, as a, um, I do love to walk, but actually, it's almost been hard. I don't feel like I've had the same level of energy to do anything, including something that I love, which is to be out walking out in nature. Um, so I have gone walking, but it's, um, I've felt like, you know, I just haven't had the same energy. So, almost anything I've, and I, let's just say I've been, I've been feeling really tired, really tired and, um, wanting to shake myself out of that too. And, um, and, I don't know, just wanting to curl up sometimes and, um, and I find that quite hard to do. 

00:19:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What, curl up in a little bit of a ball or something in bed or something? 

00:19:20
KATE Mm-hmm. Disappear under the duvet. Mm-hmm. 

00:19:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And get away from the world. 

00:19:30
KATE Yeah. 

00:19:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But you find that difficult and you're wanting to shake yourself out of...(crosstalk) 

00:19:35
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:19:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...being tired. 

00:19:35
KATE But I almost need permission to, to do the curling up in a ball. 

00:19:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Who from? 

00:19:45
KATE Well, it happens that sometimes from women friends who will, you know, ask me difficult questions, like, um, what do you do to take care of yourself, um, or, um, yes the woman friend asked me, well if you, before, if you were feeling like this, what would you normally do? And I guess, despite my distance from my parents, what I would have done in the past was to go home. And, but there isn't a home to go to now. So, I've, I've been feeling homeless at a, kind of, irrational level, but emotionally feeling homeless. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That feels very important. Um, I'm, kind of, also seeing you at 18 being homeless too. Having this, having to go and get another home. 

00:21:00
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But not really, not of, not of having that, kind of, sense of a good home that you're leaving and can come back to. It's like if you're not feeling that but you're going off and you're making this other place. 

00:21:20
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:21:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Home is, home is, is, uh, I think it's a very important word, actually. 

00:21:35
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm Kansarian so I need my home. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But you've also, you're also, kind of, saying that when your fath-, your father and mother were, when your father was, um, competent or capable and when your mother was there, you still saw that as your home, your alternate home. 

00:22:05
KATE Yes. 

00:22:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But when the chips were down or whatever and you were feeling devastated or you were feeling things were really difficult, you had that place to go to. 

00:22:15
KATE Yes, even though they weren't people I could talk to there was, there was somewhere to go. 

00:22:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, so you didn't have that in your immediate home that you'd created. 

00:22:35
KATE Um, no, cause I was married for 18 years but we didn't have a very easy time. So, one of the loneliest times of life was in my marriage, um, because he was married to his job. So, for the most part, he didn't come home. He brought his, brought his body home but didn't bring himself home so it makes sense. 

00:23:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It does make sense, yeah. And, um, passing through my mind is what you also said about the distance with your father and, um, with your mother, as well. 

00:23:15
KATE Yeah. 

00:23:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That's what you learned early on and that's what you took with you and recreated perhaps as some, sort of... 

00:23:20
KATE Yes, I've done that three times now. 

00:23:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The other thing I was thinking was that, was wanting to say really was that, um, loss and any crisis, a tremendous amount has been going on through this emotionally over this last year and, um, that's really, it's incredibly difficult. In these times, in these, kind of, situations, it's also possible to take a look at things like what home has meant to you, what relationships have been and how you've carried those patterns, because this is when they're going to get really highlighted. 

00:24:15
KATE Yes. 

00:24:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, um, and so in this, kind of, um, horrific time there's also an opportunity to, to change things. 

00:24:30
KATE Mm-mm. Okay. Sounds good. 

00:24:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I used to think of it as, uh, changing the meaning of words or connection of the word, of what the word meant, what that word home meant, for example, the very meaning of it, like, in your bones, deep in your bones, can change. 

00:24:55
KATE Mm-mm. Mm-mm, I guess it needs to now. Mm-mm. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Shaking yourself out of it didn't sound very kind. 

00:25:25
KATE Mm-mm. 

00:25:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What would be kinder? 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
KATE I guess, um, if I was loving and compassionate with myself then, um, I would be accepting, um, accepting how things work, accepting how, what I was feeling and, um... 

00:26:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, it would be, kind of, different really from your family of origin, from your...(crosstalk) 

00:26:10
KATE Yes, definitely. 

00:26:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I think that's what we're looking at, that change is possible in these very difficult times because it will get highlighted, these, kind of, things that can change. Where you can find out what it would be like to have a different inside mother, if you like. 

00:26:30
KATE Right. 

00:26:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH A kind mother, one that was, how, what would, what would a better inside mother be? 

00:26:40
KATE Um, then I think if I had an inside mother I'd feel held and, um, held, embraced, loved, felt, felt just what was going on without trying to change it. 

00:27:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Do you think you could get a sense of that? Could you embrace, could a part of you embrace this other part that feels flattened and very tired and... 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:20
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can begin to have a sense of that. 

00:27:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What's it like? 

00:27:35
KATE It's more peaceful and, um... 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:55
KATE I guess it has this sense, well, what's there is to say that it's, there's more of a timeless sense to it, um, there's no rushing. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And the other thing, the other thing that sprung to my mind earlier on and it's just sprung up again, digestion, that digesting all these experiences, these are huge experiences; it's gonna take a lot of digesting. 

00:28:30
KATE Right. 

00:28:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And that's, that's gonna need time and compassion and kindness and valuing that process, whether it's the, the sadness or, I mean, we haven't really gone into the anger state, but, um, anger, as well, and maybe other feelings too. 

00:29:00
KATE Yes, I guess it's not, it's not going to disappear that fast. 

00:29:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Which is what you'd want. 

00:29:15
KATE Yes. 

00:29:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Because it's very, very uncomfortable. 

00:29:15
KATE Yeah, it is. It is. It's painful. 

00:29:25
[sil.] 

00:29:25
KATE Yeah, I think, um, I think I got trained by mom and dad in this in some way and, um, I was, just what the image that popped back into my head was I used to be in the first team of net ball at school. But if anybody ever fell over, it was just get up, get on. And, um, I did fall badly on one occasion and had a severe gash on my knee and, uh, I did get up and I did get on, and then saw the blood running down my leg so I had to stop. So, maybe that's the point I'm at now is just recognizing there's blood running down my leg and that I do need to stop. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:45
KATE This is uncomfortable too. 

00:31:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Are you okay with that? 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Take this. 

00:32:15
KATE Thank you. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I see a very beautiful person in a lot of pain. 

00:32:55
[sil.] 

00:32:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH If you can digest that pain, it'll change and you'll change too. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:35
KATE What do you mean by digesting it? 

00:33:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The kind of things that we're starting to do now in here; giving it, digesting is really, instead of putting it all to one side or trying to chuck it out somewhere else, trying to get away from it and all those kinds of things. It's just staying with it. 

00:34:05
KATE Mm-mm, yeah. 

00:34:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Let the digestive process find its own rhythm and, uh, and methods, uh, within the context of, where this can be a, this can be a place to come and digest some of it and I'm sure it will be digested elsewhere in between in different places, as well, with friends and... 

00:34:40
KATE Right, yeah. 

00:34:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, it's a process that we're beginning. I think we'll, just by staying with it, really staying and digesting, rather than trying to puke it up, you know, get rid of it. 

00:34:55
KATE Right, yeah. Okay. 

00:34:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Because it is, it's overwhelming. It's overwhelming what you've described. But it's a little less overwhelming with someone else here, us. 

00:35:10
KATE Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, thank you, it is. Mm-mm. So, yeah, it is. I appreciate it. Mm-mm. 

00:35:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I'd suggest you take a bit of time before you can go anywhere. You know, just wait and sit for a while and be gentle with yourself. 

00:35:45
KATE Okay. Mm-mm. All right. Mm-mm. Would be a good thing to learn in the end. 

00:35:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

00:35:55
KATE Mm-mm. Mm-mm. 

00:36:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Thank you. 

00:36:05
KATE Thank you.

Bereavement and loss counselling with Dr. Anthony Crouch Counselling Psychologist

Counselling session with commentary 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:00
unconscious competence 

00:37:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH When it came to thinking about this commentary, I, uh, made, I obviously watched the film again, and made various notes, but one thing that came to me really, when I was watching, was that what I'm doing is quite complicated and, to some extent, I don't always know exactly what I'm doing in my head. Uh, that might sound a little odd, but, um, the metaphor that I came up with was that it's like riding a bicycle. When you know how to ride a bicycle quite well, you're not really thinking about all the things that are going on while you're riding that bicycle; which if you were to, kind of, analyze there's quite a lot going on. Except in this particular case, it's more like riding seven bicycles at the same time and I'll try and explain that a little bit more, but within the model that I developed, there are seven parallel processes that the counsellor is involved with when they're working with a client. 

00:38:15
seven counselling processes 

00:38:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH They're working safely, they're working with a relationship, they're working with difference and diversity, they're also working with the client factors, what's, what's important for this client. Uh, in this session, one of the key things is that I try to facilitate hope within this client. Fifthly, there's also an awareness about what's going on for me. So, another bicycle is my own, kind of, self-development and self-awareness and I have to say that I would not be able, would not have been able to do this work, to do this session, with this client, Kate, if I hadn't done already a lot of work on myself, particularly in relation to my own losses and my experiences of sadness and grief. The sixth bicycle is to do with theory and techniques and skills; it's all, uh, kind of, um, that, that what's often called a modality, uh, the approach that one has in terms of, uh, a counselling way of doing things, so a, a way of seeing things. Now, my particular approach is a combination, it's an integration, particularly of, uh, humanistic and psychodynamic, but also I have, uh, a, a background in cognitive psychologies, so I bring that in as well. That said, I have, through practice, developed my own, um, approach and particular emphasis. And the last of these bicycles is simply to look at what's actually going on, to reflect on what's going on in the session or, as I'm doing in this commentary, to reflect at a later date on that session. So, there's these seven parallel processes within the counselling process as a whole that I'm aware off, kind of, all the time really. So, while I'm thinking about a particular intervention I may, might make, I'm also feeling what's going on in this relationship and I'm also feeling what's going on in the client in terms of their, uh, what they can cope with perhaps, there's only this session. I keep, kind of, sensing to what extent can this person go into these feelings, uh, these feelings of grief and sadness. So, that's what I mean by it's a little bit difficult to know exactly what I'm doing, because there's so many things that are going on, if you like, semiconsciously. Um, and when I came to look at the session and its subsequent review two years later, I was actually quite impressed with myself, which is quite, um, is quite something really. I, I was, I've, I've really enjoyed, uh, watching these sessions again and seeing that the work I, the contribution I made in this first sess-, session with, um, Kate had such a profound, uh, impact or, or, or, she did many other things, but it was clearly important for her, in terms of the enormous therapeutic change which she achieves in the two years subsequently. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:10
A personal request 

00:42:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH This session with Kate where she talks about her quite overwhelming losses was quite a profound session for me. In it, I felt that we really did connect and I sensed someone who is really quite beautiful and was in a great deal of pain and I felt deeply touched at that moment around, uh, towards the end of the session. So, when you watch this session, I don't know, it feels a little bit like something quite private and, in a way, I suppose I would like you to watch it with respect. 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:25
A few minutes into the session 

00:43:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, Kate, um, we talked about quite a few things but decided that the most important thing was to focus on the recent losses that you've experienced. 

00:43:45
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:43:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, uh, in particular, the loss of your mother about a year ago, just over a year ago. 

00:43:50
KATE Yes. 

00:43:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then the loss of a partner in the, uh, September...(crosstalk) 

00:43:55
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:43:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then another kind of loss, uh, with your father moving into a home in the, in January. 

00:44:05
KATE Mm-hmm. 

00:44:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Moving out there for a while to be with him. 

00:44:10
KATE Yes. 

00:44:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then having to, um, deal with the, the house, the home and, uh, as he, as he moved into a home and clearing his home. 

00:44:20
KATE Yes and, and selling it. 

00:44:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, and selling it. So, really, uh, an enormous amount of loss to cope with, to have to deal with in, in a relatively short time. 

00:44:35
KATE Mm-hmm, yeah, that's what it's felt like. 

00:44:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

00:44:40
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's one thing at a time might have been all right but just the combination has been really difficult. 

00:44:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And so, how have you been? Coping or not coping? 

00:45:00
KATE Um, I've been very tired. And, um, I think I coped with my mother initially fine because she was 88. She wanted to, she wanted to go and I was, kind of, happy for her that she went as easily as she did. So, it almost didn't seem like there was any reason to mourn, um...(crosstalk) 

00:45:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Was it, um, her death, something that you had time to prepare for, or was it sudden? 

00:45:40
KATE No, it happened very quickly in the end. 

00:45:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Okay. 

00:45:40
KATE Yeah, it was unexpected for everybody. 

00:45:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Right. 

00:45:45
KATE Um, she, she was only in hospital for 12 hours. Um, she had an infection that just spread round her body and, um, she left. And I was driving back from the other side of the country to try and get to be with her, um; so, it was the morning, it was a harbor's(inaudible) day, one morning that I realized, well, my brother called to say that she was not well, she'd been taken into hospital. And my father called and told me and, um, neither of them thought she was dying, but I tuned in to her, felt her and I thought, actually, she's dying, I have to go now. So, I packed the car and got in the car but I was in the west country and, um, they live on the east coast, so it was an awful long way to drive. So, I, I thought I just have to drive as hard as I can, um, but four hours into the drive, en-, energetically, I felt her leave and, um, I knew she died. And so, I knew the next thing that would happen would be my brother calling to say that she died and that is what happened. So, I just, I, he called and I said, ‘Yes, I know,’ and, um, asked him to tell the nursing staff in hospital that I wanted to go and see her. So I just drove the rest of the way home and, um, I went to see her body to say good-bye to her body. And that was the first time I'd seen anybody having passed, so I would choose that, I would choose my mom as the first time, and, uh, but it was good to say good-bye. Yeah. It was. It seems to have got harder than easier the more the time's gone by. 

00:48:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, at first, it seemed okay. She was 88 and she was ready to go but now, as you're talking, clearly you're very upset. 

00:48:15
KATE Yes. Um, we didn't have an easy relationship when I was a child and so since I was 18 I've always lived at least 100 miles away from home. Um, cause we didn't seem to be able to talk, so I wasn't, I, I would say I wasn't close to my mom. But, um, she was my mom, so whatever life was like when she, she and I were together, I miss her. I really miss her now, which is almost a surprise cause I've been a very independent woman. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:05
KATE I have to use one of these. 

00:49:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That's what they're for, there for. 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then, just a few months later... 

00:49:40
KATE Yes, and then in September, it was necessary for me to end a relationship that I'd had with a man that I'd loved for 11 years. And, um, I don't need to go into the details why, but I had to call a halt to it. And, um, that was, been one of the hardest things I've had to do. And, um, I miss him enormously. That has been very, very painful. So I thought in many ways that I was missing, I was mourning him more than, or mourning the loss of the relationship, more than, um, more than my mom, but maybe it's all just got tangled up together. 

00:50:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Well, it sounds like there's a lot of feelings about different people in a relatively short time. 

00:50:40
KATE Mm-mm. 

00:50:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Feelings of loss can also get tangled up with other feelings of loss earlier in life too. It can be, the whole thing can, kind of, get very mixed up into it. Cause you've said there that, um, earlier, just now you were talking about your mother and how you'd moved away and that you weren't that close to her. 

00:51:00
KATE No. 

00:51:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So maybe there's also issues there about, um, the loss of the mother that you could've had, uh, but didn't. 

00:51:10
KATE Yes, I thought, I thought for many years I had the wrong mother. She wasn't a mother I could ever talk to. And, um, my father I adored but he was a very remote figure, you know, he was working very hard and cared for us...(crosstalk) 

00:51:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH When you say was, though, he hasn't actually, he hasn't passed away? 

00:51:35
KATE No, he's not died, he's, he's, he's 90 now, um, it's just that he too is not the man he was. 

00:51:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So there there's a sense of the person you knew has gone. 

00:51:45
KATE Yes, really. 

00:51:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The person you knew, adored as your father...(crosstalk) 

00:51:50
KATE Yes. 

00:51:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Isn't there anymore. 

00:51:55
KATE No, not really. Only he's struggling, cause he's now living in a home and he's struggling. He, he's lost his life partner. They were together for 68 years and he's lost his physical health and he's living in a strange place, strange to him and he's lost his independence and he's lost, he's losing his faculties. It's a really hard time for him. 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:30
Kate's presenting issues 

00:52:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Over the past year, Kate has experienced a series of, of really quite major losses. The first of these is the death of her mother, which initially she says didn't affect her that deeply, but which has subsequently started to, uh, she started to grieve. And that's a little bit complicated by the fact that her relationship with her mother was not a good one. She wasn't the mother she would have wished for; she was not, from Kate's perspective, a good enough mother. She, Kate was disappointed in her mothering. The second loss, which again is a, is a huge one, uh, is the loss of a partner, long-term partner that she loved very much and, again, that's complicated by the type of ending. Kate doesn't go into it, but it's clear that it was not a good ending. It was something that she says she had to end. The third of these major losses is the loss of her father, which isn't in the form of a death, it's what, in recent research, has been named ambiguous loss. Her father is still alive, but he's growing quite old and for Kate, he's no longer the man he was. He's no longer psychologically present in that way that she experienced him as her father. He's still physically present, but the man she knew has disappeared. And linked to that is the loss of her family home, the home where she grew up. Her father has gone into a residential home and Kate has been the one responsible for, uh, clearing the family home and then selling it. And, again, without the recent complications, because home, the family home, again, isn't really what she would have wished for it. It's something that she looks back on as not being really good enough. 

00:55:00
KATE And, um, but it's like he's turned to me now and I guess there's some kind of role reversal that he needs, he needs me and my support now, which he, he's never needed before. Cause his focus was always on mom. 

00:55:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So you were always remote. 

00:55:25
KATE Yes. 

00:55:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now that, in a sense, he's become this other person or has grown, has become so old that he's no longer who he was, that that's changed too. 

00:55:35
KATE Yes. 

00:55:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH There's a real need on his side for you. 

00:55:45
KATE Mm-mm. And he said, um, I think that it's time I went back to see him because I stayed with him for two and a half months to see him through the transition, but then I had to go back to my life. Though, when I went back again he talked about feeling abandoned and at a, kind of, an intellectual level, I completely understood, but actually at an emotional level I was so angry. I had this huge response, which was, ‘Oh, really, that's a fine one. You abandoned me a long time ago, so now you know what it feels like.’ That was the reaction that I had. 

00:56:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So almost a bit vengeful as well. 

00:56:40
KATE Well, it, it sounds like it but I didn't really, it didn't last as a vengeful feeling, but it was there. Uh, it just feels like, like some, you know, he, kind of, left a long time ago. 

00:57:00
[sil.] 

00:57:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And loss isn't just about grief, it's also about anger and also about fear. So, anger can be there for other reasons too, you know, for that there's a genuine, there's a good reason to be angry because he, he did abandon you a long time ago. At the same time, the feeling when you lose somebody it's not just grief, there's also anger and often the anger gets, uh, pushed to one side. 

00:57:30
KATE Mm-hmm. Right. Excuse me. 

00:57:40
[sil.] 

00:57:40
how the past can shape the present 

00:57:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So Kate is really quite angry and anger is a very normal part of any loss, any, any major, uh, bereavement or other type of loss. She's triggered when her father says that she, he felt abandoned by her. She had spent quite a bit of time with him after he moved into the residential home, but then she'd needed to go back into her life and had come back to see him and he had expressed this feeling of abandonment. And she, um, didn't say it to him, but in her head she thinks, that's a fine one, you abandoned me many, many years ago. So, it's a, it's a trigger, uh, that, uh, expression of abandonment for lots of feelings. Feelings, if you like, of normal anger to do with loss and all the losses that she's be-, been experiencing, but also there's something particular about it, which is her own experience of feeling abandoned, feeling, losing her parents far too early on really, well, that's, that's how she experienced it. 

00:59:05
[sil.] 

00:59:05
exploring anger 

00:59:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now, we don't really go into the, um, the, the experience, or we don't really go into the expression of that anger, but it is something very important. It, it, it, it's something that, um, particularly, perhaps women who are often culturally conditioned not to express anger in the same way that men are, kind of, allowed to express anger a bit more; women find, women can often find it quite difficult to express that anger. That's important to acknowledge and, and give, uh, a space and time, particularly in counselling, a sense of a safe space to express that anger. 

00:59:45
KATE Yeah...(crosstalk) 

00:59:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Could you use another one? 

00:59:45
KATE ...I can see that. Okay. Thank you. 

00:59:55
[sil.] 

00:59:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I mean, my, my overall feeling is just, like, this is so much. It's, like, completely emotionally boggling and mind boggling; it's emotionally boggling to have so much in such a short period of time. Must be really, it must have been really, you know, almost like these different shocks coming in, the losses coming in, one after the other. It must have been very, um, devastating then. 

01:00:35
KATE Mm-hmm. It has been and it's, um, kind of, flattened my physical energy. It's been, it's been hard to, sort of, do what I normally do easily. Um, I've been struggling. 

01:00:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Would you expect to be able to do what you normally do? 

01:01:00
KATE Yes. 

01:01:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Really? That...(crosstalk) 

01:01:05
KATE Normally. 

01:01:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...makes no sense at all. 

01:01:05
KATE No, but it's just, um, a life pattern. Being able to, um, I, uh, my father, as well, is just, kind of, um, well I don't know what you call it, stoicism or something, of just being able to deal with it, get on. 

01:01:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, what would be a, a different way, a kinder way of, um, looking at yourself now? 

01:01:40
[sil.] 

01:01:40
KATE I, well, I guess it's just, it's about acknowledging what has happened and that actually that amount of loss in that amount of time is, is a lot to deal, for anybody to deal with. So, um, the word that came into my head, head was compassion. That I probably need some compassion for myself. 

01:02:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Compassion, yeah, and a, and a lot of caring. 

01:02:15
[sil.] 

01:02:15
KATE Yeah. 

01:02:20
[sil.] 

01:02:20
challenging Kate 

01:02:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Kate is really quite hard on herself. She's experienced these major losses and yet, she's kind of expecting that she's going to be able to, uh, live her life as normal, get on with things as normal. She's finding it a struggle but she's not acknowledging that actually that's normal, that that's how it should be, because she has actually got a tremendous amount of feelings, um, to, to deal with, uh, and very difficult and painful feelings. And I suppose the reality is that these, you know, sadness and other uncomfortable feelings there, they are very painful, they are very difficult to, to, to really allow oneself to feel and express, um, particularly when we're talking about key people in, in someone's life. And we're talking here about, uh, both of her parents and, uh, a long-term partner who she was deeply in love with, plus her, the, the, the family home, the home of her origin. So, I would expect someone to, to not be deal-, handling this terribly well. It, it's something they have to spend time with and, and, and, and care for; they have to care for themselves, they have to, uh, accept the reality of these losses and, and, and, and give themselves, give themselves, um, warmth really and, and, and love to, to, to cope with them. And yet, with all of this, kind of, almost see it behind her, you know, these, these major losses and all these feelings like some huge, uh, mountains really, behind her and yet she's expecting that she can just, kind of, carry on with her life. So, at this point I'm really quite challenging to her, um, and I think that challenge is effective. She, it, kind of, stops her and makes her think, well, actually, yeah, this is enormous and, um, and perhaps I do need to look after myself. Even though it's not something that she's been brought up to do, she's, as she says in session, she wasn't really brought up to care for and be gentle and love herself. 

01:05:15
KATE And if it feels so easy when you live on your own. 

01:05:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It, it feels so easy? 

01:05:20
KATE No, it doesn't feel so easy. 

01:05:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH No. 

01:05:25
KATE Uh, for somebody, as I do live on my own, is cause, like, you have to just get on and do what you have to do. 

01:05:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Since September or before then or? 

01:05:35
KATE Oh, just always. Well, since I've lived on my own, I guess. 

01:05:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, when you split up with your partner, you weren't living together? 

01:05:45
KATE No. 

01:05:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, you've lived alone for, for quite a long time. 

01:05:50
KATE Yeah, for a number of years. Um, I've lost count really, but probably about 12 years now. 

01:06:00
[sil.] 

01:06:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And again, it is, it is difficult when you're on your own. 

01:06:05
KATE Yeah, it's tougher. 

01:06:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Cause there isn't someone there to be caring. 

01:06:10
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:06:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Be a friend, be... So, that's another reason to be even more compassionate towards yourself. 

01:06:25
[sil.] 

01:06:30
KATE Mm-hmm. I suppose it is. Mm-hmm. 

01:06:40
[sil.] 

01:06:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Could you say a bit more about the flattened, I think you used the word flattened, that you've been flattened by it. 

01:06:50
KATE Um, I, just a sense of, um, a loss of energy, of being, um, well, as a, um, I do love to walk, but actually, it's almost been hard. I don't feel like I've had the same level of energy to do anything, including something that I love, which is to be out walking out in nature. Um, so I have gone walking, but it's, um, I've felt like, you know, I just haven't had the same energy. So, almost anything I've, and I, let's just say I've been, I've been feeling really tired, really tired and, um, wanting to shake myself out of that too. And, um, and, I don't know, just wanting to curl up sometimes and, um, and I find that quite hard to do. 

01:08:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What, curl up in a little bit of a ball or something in bed or something? 

01:08:15
KATE Mm-hmm. Disappear under the duvet. Mm-hmm. 

01:08:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And get away from the world. 

01:08:20
KATE Yeah. 

01:08:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But you find that difficult and you're wanting to shake yourself out of...(crosstalk) 

01:08:30
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:08:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...being tired. 

01:08:30
KATE But I almost need permission to, to do the curling up in a ball. 

01:08:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Who from? 

01:08:40
KATE Well, it happens that sometimes from women friends who will, you know, ask me difficult questions, like, um, what do you do to take care of yourself, um, or, um, yes the woman friend asked me, well if you, before, if you were feeling like this, what would you normally do? And I guess, despite my distance from my parents, what I would have done in the past was to go home. And, but there isn't a home to go to now. So, I've, I've been feeling homeless at a, kind of, irrational level, but emotionally feeling homeless. 

01:09:35
[sil.] 

01:09:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That feels very important. Um, I'm, kind of, also seeing you at 18 being homeless too. Having this, having to go and get another home. 

01:09:55
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:09:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But not really, not of, not of having that, kind of, sense of a good home that you're leaving and can come back to. It's like if you're not feeling that but you're going off and you're making this other place. 

01:10:15
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:10:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Home is, home is, is, uh, I think it's a very important word, actually. 

01:10:30
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm Kansarian so I need my home. 

01:10:40
[sil.] 

01:10:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But you've also, you're also, kind of, saying that when your fath-, your father and mother were, when your father was, um, competent or capable and when your mother was there, you still saw that as your home, your alternate home. 

01:11:00
KATE Yes. 

01:11:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But when the chips were down or whatever and you were feeling devastated or you were feeling things were really difficult, you had that place to go to. 

01:11:10
KATE Yes, even though they weren't people I could talk to there was, there was somewhere to go. 

01:11:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, so you didn't have that in your immediate home that you'd created. 

01:11:30
KATE Um, no, cause I was married for 18 years but we didn't have a very easy time. So, one of the loneliest times of life was in my marriage, um, because he was married to his job. So, for the most part, he didn't come home. He brought his, brought his body home but didn't bring himself home so it makes sense. 

01:11:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It does make sense, yeah. And, um, passing through my mind is what you also said about the distance with your father and, um, with your mother, as well. 

01:12:10
KATE Yeah. 

01:12:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That's what you learned early on and that's what you took with you and recreated perhaps as some, sort of... 

01:12:15
KATE Yes, I've done that three times now. 

01:12:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The other thing I was thinking was that, was wanting to say really was that, um, loss and any crisis, a tremendous amount has been going on through this emotionally over this last year and, um, that's really, it's incredibly difficult. In these times, in these, kind of, situations, it's also possible to take a look at things like what home has meant to you, what relationships have been and how you've carried those patterns, because this is when they're going to get really highlighted. 

01:13:10
KATE Yes. 

01:13:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, um, and so in this, kind of, um, horrific time there's also an opportunity to, to change things. 

01:13:25
KATE Mm-mm. Okay. Sounds good. 

01:13:35
[sil.] 

01:13:35
facilitating hope within Kate 

01:13:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Up until this point I've been doing quite a lot of things including, obviously, listening, uh, but I've also been, been trying to give Kate a sense that she can kind of go into these feelings and come out of them. But at this particular point, I'm, um, making a fairly major intervention and that, this type of intervention, which is related to hope, facilitating hopefulness within the client, this particular type of intervention has been recently, in research, recently demonstrated to be very, very important. Hope and hopefulness is critical really, in terms of the client being able to motivate themselves to, um, to work through things and to achieve therapeutic changes. So, I'm attempting something, which is actually quite difficult, because on the one hand, I don't want to give any kind of sense to this, to Kate, that I'm dismissing her experience, which is, which is huge and overwhelming and very painful, but on the other hand, I'm also trying to, to say that within or at a time like this in her life when, when she's having to cope with this distress and everything is in flux, if you like, it's this kind of time that she can really make major changes. In other words, changes that go beyond simply, um, coping with the, the bereavement and the, and the breakdown of the relationship and the ambiguous loss of her father and the loss of home; so going beyond simply, kind of, coping with that and actually maybe addressing some of the, the things in her life or the aspects of her as a person that she would like, herself would love to change. I, I'm trying to say that in this, in this moment of pain and difficulty and confusion, there's also an opportunity for, for another type of change, which is something she might really want. And I think actually I'm, it, it's a very delicate, um, it's a very delicate or difficult thing to do. You can't dismiss the pain as all too easy for someone to misread it or for the client to misread this type of intervention as, you know, I want you to deny these feelings and, and, and, and, uh, kind of, be positive. It, it's not about that. It's about recognizing the pain and also that within this, there is the potential for something positive, there is hope. 

01:16:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I used to think of it as, uh, changing the meaning of words or connection of the word, of what the word meant, what that word home meant, for example, the very meaning of it, like, in your bones, deep in your bones, can change. 

01:16:55
KATE Mm-mm. 

01:17:00
[sil.] 

01:17:00
KATE Mm-mm, I guess it needs to now. 

01:17:10
[sil.] 

01:17:15
KATE Mm-mm. 

01:17:20
[sil.] 

01:17:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Shaking yourself out of it didn't sound very kind. 

01:17:30
KATE Mm-mm. 

01:17:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What would be kinder? 

01:17:40
[sil.] 

01:17:40
KATE I guess, um, if I was loving and compassionate with myself then, um, I would be accepting, um, accepting how things work, accepting how, what I was feeling and, um... 

01:18:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, it would be, kind of, different really from your family of origin, from your...(crosstalk) 

01:18:10
KATE Yes, definitely. 

01:18:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I think that's what we're looking at, that change is possible in these very difficult times because it will get highlighted, these, kind of, things that can change. Where you can find out what it would be like to have a different inside mother, if you like. 

01:18:35
KATE Right. 

01:18:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH A kind mother, one that was, how, what would, what would a better inside mother be? 

01:18:45
KATE Um, then I think if I had an inside mother I'd feel held and, um, held, embraced, loved, felt, felt just what was going on without trying to change it. 

01:19:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Do you think you could get a sense of that? Could you embrace, could a part of you embrace this other part that feels flattened and very tired and... 

01:19:25
[sil.] 

01:19:25
KATE Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can begin to have a sense of that. 

01:19:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What's it like? 

01:19:40
KATE It's more peaceful and, um... 

01:19:50
[sil.] 

01:19:50
KATE I guess it has this sense, well, what's there is to say that it's, there's more of a timeless sense to it, um, there's no rushing. 

01:20:15
[sil.] 

01:20:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And the other thing, the other thing that sprung to my mind earlier on and it's just sprung up again, digestion, that digesting all these experiences, these are huge experiences; it's gonna take a lot of digesting. 

01:20:35
KATE Right. 

01:20:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And that's, that's gonna need time and compassion and kindness and valuing that process, whether it's the, the sadness or, I mean, we haven't really gone into the anger state, but, um, anger, as well, and maybe other feelings too. 

01:21:05
KATE Yes, I guess it's not, it's not going to disappear that fast. 

01:21:15
[sil.] 

01:21:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Which is what you'd want. 

01:21:20
KATE Yes. 

01:21:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Because it's very, very uncomfortable. 

01:21:20
KATE Yeah, it is. It is. It's painful. 

01:21:30
[sil.] 

01:21:30
three therapeutic goals 

01:21:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Recent research has demonstrated the importance of something called goal consensus and collaboration. What this means is that you work with the client to agree goals and then collaborate together on working towards achieving them. In this session I spent a long time listening to Kate and her experiences of loss and some of the aspects of her personal history that have related to those losses. At this point in the session, I suggest a series of three goals that Kate might work towards. 

01:22:25
[sil.] 

01:22:25
home is where the heart is 

01:22:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The first of these is to develop the kind of home that she never had, the home where she feels really at home. And I put this in terms of changing the meaning of the word home so that it, within, deep within her, within her very bones, means perhaps, what she's always wanted it to mean. 

01:22:55
[sil.] 

01:22:55
developing inner compassion 

01:22:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The second of the goals I've already pointed to early on in the session when I challenged her about her expect-, expectation that she could just carry on and, kind of, live life as normal, despite the fact that she's had to deal with these four very major losses. And that second goal is simply to learn to care for herself more, learn to be gentle with herself, learn, if you like, to love herself a little more. And I put this in terms of being a different type of mother to herself, kind of, inner mother. The mother that she grew up with was a disappointment. She didn't feel really cared for by her mother. And that is something she took in. We all do this, we go out with parents and we take them inside ourselves and we have, if you like, a little mother and a little father inside ourselves and we tend to, kind of, repeat the way that they were with us with ourselves. But that doesn't have to stay like that. We can change our inner mother and our inner father. We can, in this case with Kate, Kate can learn to be more gentle with herself, to be more loving. 

01:24:30
[sil.] 

01:24:30
emotional digestion 

01:24:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And the third of the goals is to digest her experiences and by this I mean to digest the emotions, the sadness, the anger, the, the overwhelming feelings that are very painful and difficult, but nevertheless, need digesting. 

01:24:55
[sil.] 

01:24:55
KATE Yeah, I think, um, I think I got trained by mom and dad in this in some way and, um, I was, just what the image that popped back into my head was I used to be in the first team of net ball at school. But if anybody ever fell over, it was just get up, get on. And, um, I did fall badly on one occasion and had a severe gash on my knee and, uh, I did get up and I did get on, and then saw the blood running down my leg so I had to stop. So, maybe that's the point I'm at now is just recognizing there's blood running down my leg and that I do need to stop. 

01:26:10
[sil.] 

01:26:10
KATE This is uncomfortable too. 

01:27:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Are you okay with that? 

01:27:25
[sil.] 

01:27:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Take this. 

01:27:45
KATE Thank you. 

01:27:50
[sil.] 

01:27:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I see a very beautiful person in a lot of pain. 

01:28:20
[sil.] 

01:28:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH If you can digest that pain, it'll change and you'll change too. 

01:29:00
[sil.] 

01:29:10
KATE What do you mean by digesting it? 

01:29:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The kind of things that we're starting to do now in here; giving it, digesting is really, instead of putting it all to one side or trying to chuck it out somewhere else, trying to get away from it and all those kinds of things. It's just staying with it. 

01:29:30
KATE Mm-mm, yeah. 

01:29:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Let the digestive process find its own rhythm and, uh, and methods. 

01:29:45
KATE Right, yeah. 

01:29:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, it's a process that we're beginning. I think we'll, just by staying with it, really staying and digesting, rather than trying to puke it up, you know, get rid of it. 

01:29:55
KATE Right, yeah. Okay. 

01:30:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Because it is, it's overwhelming. It's overwhelming what you've described. But it's a little less overwhelming with someone else here, us. 

01:30:15
KATE Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, thank you, it is. Mm-mm. So, yeah, it is. I appreciate it. Mm-mm. 

01:30:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I'd suggest you take a bit of time before you can go anywhere. You know, just wait and sit for a while and be gentle with yourself. 

01:30:45
KATE Okay. Mm-mm. All right. Mm-mm. Would be a good thing to learn in the end. 

01:31:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

01:31:00
KATE Mm-mm. Mm-mm. 

01:31:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Thank you. 

01:31:10
KATE Thank you. 

01:31:15
[sil.] 

01:31:15
the therapeutic conclusion to the session 

01:31:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Three key things happen towards the end of the session. Firstly, I've created a safe enough space for Kate to feel that she can really come and sit in the seat of her pain and she enters into those feelings quite profoundly. Secondly, I self-disclose the way that I am seeing her, which is as this quite special person, a beautiful person. And thirdly, out of these two, uh, events, we connect in what has recently been called or termed in the research, the real relationship. There's, there's a very deep sense of connection between us two as persons where we're both there, where I'm really present with Kate and she's really present with me. There is, uh, a sense of being together that is quite profound and which, in the later review, Kate refers to as really critically important. So those three things. That I've created the space where she can feel safe enough to begin to feel the feelings, to enter into the, the profound feelings of loss that she's had to, as having, has had to deal with over the past year. Secondly, in that, in that vulnerable place I, I disclose a genuine perception of her as this beautiful person. And thirdly, out of those two events of light we, we connect, we, we are present with each other in a very deep and meaningful way.

Bereavement and loss counselling with Dr. Anthony Crouch Counselling Psychologist 

01:34:00
Review session with commentary 

01:34:20
[sil.] 

01:34:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, it's been nearly two years, Kate, since we, um, had our session together looking at your experience of loss, your bereavement and other losses. And, uh, you've come back, you've taken a look at that session on DVD. I also took a look at it again about a week ago. Um, and I thought it would be good just to, to talk about what's happened in between, how you are, what it's like to look at that session again, nearly two years old. 

01:35:05
KATE Yes. 

01:35:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And anything else that seems relevant, really for the purpose of, um, helping people to understand something about loss and how, how, um, if affects us. Particularly, how it affected you. 

01:35:25
KATE Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Well, it was certainly, um, uh, it, it was actually an amazing experience to look back at the video, DVD. Uh, it sounds strange to sound forgotten, but I think to see it, um, concentrated, um, into that time and hear myself say what I said, um, I was in tears again. So I could, I, kind of, related to my own pain and, um, remembered, um, how it was and to feel that actually, it hasn't all gone away. There's still some pain there, um, albeit, not the same concentrated level, uh, that it was then. And, and I'd, I'd almost forgotten that part of the grief was the loss of my home, the physical home that had been my parents' home. Um, and I think partly because I've subsequently moved house and for me, what that has represented is that I have come home. So what...(crosstalk) 

01:36:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Which is one of the things we were looking at. 

01:36:50
KATE That's right, it was. It's one of the things that you mentioned. And so I was looking at the DVD and I thought, gosh, I'm not sure how much work I've done on that; and yet, actually, I've physically moved to a place that is truly home for me. 

01:37:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That sounds really, really important actually. 

01:37:10
KATE It is, it is. So, there's a sense in which I've finally grown up. It's the, at the, in this, you know, that I've taken responsibility for not having some other place be home, but here I am. Um, and all my life, wherever I've moved to, I've always thought this will be home for as long as it's home, but I've always known, always felt that it was never a place that I'd stay. And I'd stay for seven years or three and a half years or seven years, it was often seven years or a multiple of that, but this one, um, cause I've also turned 60 since then; so there's something about arriving at 60, which you don't have any control over, you just, kind of, arrive here or not. So, I've arrived at 60 and in the same, in my 60, 60th year found the place where I think, ‘Oh, here's where I'm going to be for the next 30 years.’ So there's, um, there's this, kind of, coming together of something. Um, I adore the sighting. It isn't that it's an extraordinarily beautiful house, it's a very nice house, but it's the landscape. I'm halfway up a hill, overlooking the most beautiful view imaginable. Um, and I have access to 18 acres of land, of, of woodland. And the river Team runs through it, so I've actually got fishing rights on the river Team, which is, I probably will never use. Um, so there's, um, for me, it's about the situation, about the land and the river and that actually, aside from, it feels more like grand-mothering myself now. It's that the land holds me, that particular land holds me, and where I find my nourishment, where I find my solace, where I find, um, joy, is through the land. 

01:39:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, very much a sense there also, cause one, I remember one of the key things was always about being caring for yourself, being gentle with yourself. 

01:39:45
KATE Yes. 

01:39:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It feels like this, kind of, combined, and in a way I think necessarily so, to, to really have, to create one's own home, is very much an act of caring for oneself. 

01:39:55
KATE Yes. Mm-mm. 

01:40:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And it sounds really very special actually. 

01:40:00
KATE It is. 

01:40:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH A very, very special place. 

01:40:05
KATE It is, yeah, and it is, it feels energetically it, it is a very special place and, um, it is utterly beautiful. And for me it's important to have the river flowing through it. There's something about being in the flow, um, and because, I think probably since I last saw you, I've qualified as a Shamanic healer. So, as a Shaman, I'm, you know, it's just perfect. So, I'm also gonna create an Earth lodge in the land so I can have clients actually who will also be held by patch mama, by mother Earth, which, um, I've got so many ideas. It's as if I've come out to a place where there's endless possibility. And I've, I, kind of, went through a time when it didn't feel like that at all. 

01:41:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Felt, kind of, the opposite. 

01:41:05
KATE Absolutely, yes. So, I've got a new lease of life, cause I remember seeing, and just now, that I was saying that I had no energy. I felt flattened, um, but there aren't enough hours in the day now. I have energy. I much more physical then I was cause the place I moved from was small, it was contained and here, you know, I'm actually, um, proposing to go on a, uh, a one day course to learn how to use a, a circular saw so I can actually saw my own wood for my wood burner. So, this feels very exciting. 

01:41:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It does indeed. It feels, it also feels really quite transforming. You're describing quite a transformation really, in terms of your life, and also the way that you've managed to really root in a place. 

01:41:55
KATE Yes. 

01:41:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And make a commitment to creating a home. 

01:42:00
KATE Yes. 

01:42:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, and that, kind of, feeds also into this wider capability of looking after yourself. 

01:42:05
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:42:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And how's that been, uh, as well, as well as the home, how are you in yourself, in terms of, uh, being gentle with yourself and stuff like that? 

01:42:20
KATE Um, hmm, I'm not sure I can claim too much improvement, um, but I do hold that awareness. I think I am, I am actually better. Um, I'm involved in a very exciting project at the minute, um, converting some redundant farm buildings into a haven for inspiration, creativity and healing. I've been involved in all aspects of that, um, so one of the challenges is to find the balance of having time at home, time in the garden, time on the land and time engaged in something very creative. 

01:43:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, in other words, life is so full that you've really got to make priority decisions, you've got to have a balance between various needs of the different parts of yourself. 

01:43:15
KATE Yes. 

01:43:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH All of the different...(crosstalk) 

01:43:20
KATE But I am actually conscious of that now, even if I don't succeed; always there's this, I think, I probably have got more consciousness of that. Mm-mm. 

01:43:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And you also said right at the beginning that, um, you watched the video and you, you touched in again to the real sense of sadness, grief... 

01:43:40
KATE Yes. 

01:43:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And that it's still very much there, but it sounds as though definitely, it's there in a different kind of way...(crosstalk) 

01:43:45
KATE It's there in a different way. It's not entirely gone, um, I still...(crosstalk) 

01:43:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Actually, let me interrupt you for a sec, cause when you first sat down, what, what actually went through my mind was, would you really want it to have gone, because if somebody's special in your life that you lose, then they're always gonna be special. 

01:44:10
KATE Yes. 

01:44:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And they're always gonna feel a depth of sadness. It's where that sadness is in you and how it affects your life that's the important thing. Anyway, I interrupted. 

01:44:25
KATE No, no. Um, yes, I think what I've come to terms with a lot more is, is the death of my mother, cause it actually will be three years this year. Um, I feel I've a whole new relationship with her. So, although she's in spirit, she's actually, I feel, she's supporting me now in a way she never did when she got a body. So, I have, I have...(crosstalk) 

01:45:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That sounds, that sounds very, very significant actually. 

01:45:05
KATE Yes. And I did see a medium twice who, through whom my mother communicated. Um, and so my mother apologized for some of the things that she had done, uh, or not done and she, now she said that she could really see me. Um, and she said that she, kind of, thought I was better a bit now, she, she knows I am. And all that just really did transform my relationship with my mother. So, I could, if you like, reinterpret the necessity I've had to what I've learned from the, the lack of mothering at the time; I, I suppose gives me my medicine, gives me my understanding for working with others, as well. Um, but also it's really important for me to know that my mother is utterly supporting me from where she is now. Um, that's made a huge difference. 

01:46:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And from where, what I remember, I, that seemed quite, I don't know exactly how, it seemed, sort of, in the first session, but I remember saying something to you about that it seemed very clear that I was seeing this very special person. I don't know if you remember? 

01:46:30
KATE I remember it very well. And I remember it very well from the experience of that, so that was a gift for me. So, I felt seen by you; I felt utterly seen and utterly heard by you and that was, you'll never quite know what a gift that was. So, there I've just seen it again in the DVD, um, I didn't actually need reminding of that. 

01:47:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But it's almost as if that, somehow you are able to see yourself and allow your mother in spirit to see you truthfully as a special person too. 

01:47:15
KATE Yes. 

01:47:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH She said, I think you said that, um, through this medium, she said that you were, um, she always thought you were special, but now, now she really, really knows it. 

01:47:25
KATE She knows it. 

01:47:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

01:47:30
KATE Yeah. 

01:47:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, and I foresee that the, the place that you found, as I said, it sounds really special. It does sound really, really special...(crosstalk) 

01:47:40
KATE Yes. 

01:47:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...this place. And I almost said, a special place for a special person 10 minutes ago or whatever. 

01:47:45
KATE Okay. 

01:47:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That's what it felt like, yeah. 

01:47:45
KATE Yeah. 

01:47:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH You found, it sounded amazing what you were describing. 

01:47:50
KATE Yes, it is. It's beautiful and it's also place with the very weather my mother would love. Um, so, you know, that's another aspect of it really. Yeah, so she can be there. She can enjoy it. 

01:48:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, anyone watching this kind of, uh, I don't know what exactly this is, it's a, kind of, debrief nearly two years on from...(crosstalk) 

01:48:15
KATE Yes. 

01:48:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...from the session. 

01:48:15
KATE Yeah. 

01:48:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I imagine watching, one of the things I might be thinking is that this actually does sound like a very positive, uh, movement through the grief. 

01:48:30
KATE Mm-hmm. 

01:48:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH You know, there's probably other things, as well, but the grief is certainly an important part of this process. You seem to have arrived at a very, very good place, really, from, you know, a place that was very, well, how did you describe it? It was very closed off wasn't it? It was very... 

01:48:45
KATE Yes, I'd say it was bleak. 

01:48:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Bleak. 

01:48:50
KATE Mm-hmm. And painful, emotionally painful, but painful at a physical level, as well. I actually, um, my body was in pain, my heart was in pain and, um, as you recall, I didn't want to be there. It was not a place, I wanted to throw it all out, I wanted to get out the other end of it. And, um, you know, what you said a few minutes back about I don't have to clear it all or it, it, it won't just disappear, continue to, kind of, shift through like that. It's also not the nature of it. And, and the man who had been very precious to me, very important, the pain of that, the loss of that is diminished but it's definitely not gone. Um, and it is partly because I will never not love him. Um, and will always wish him well and always have him, not constant in my thoughts, but occasionally just, um, wonder and think how is he, cause I have no contact. So, um, and to really appreciate him still for the gifts that he brought me. 

01:50:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Well, kind of, following on from that, I suppose I would say that, um, I believe, really, to be a hu-, fully human, we, we experience all these different emotions. You know, we experience, you, at the moment, you're experiencing quite a lot of excitement about life, probably happiness and joy associated with that, uh, and yet, also, you can touch into the grief. 

01:50:35
KATE Yes. 

01:50:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And the sadness and really feel that without it overwhelming you and your life in any way at all. 

01:50:40
KATE Yes. 

01:50:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, um, I remember once myself, um, having a week where I was feeling really, really a depth of grief and yet it also became, this was after a lot of work on the loss, it became for me a, um, a celebration of how special this person was in my life. And I, and I, kind of, thought to myself, if I wasn't feeling this, it would almost be like a, kind of, insult to them and myself. 

01:51:15
KATE Yes, yes, there's a, kind of, direct proportion, there's a, kind of, proportionality, isn't there, to the depth of love to the depth of grief, um... 

01:51:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, exactly. 

01:51:30
KATE Yeah. 

01:51:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It was some, it was, by being so sad and confused and it was very, very painful for me, you know, it was for longer than that, but I really went into it for a week or so and, um, you know, it kind of, to the extent where I felt quite, I couldn't really function that well in day-to-day life. But I also felt during that time, for the first time, that, um, it was also this celebration of the love I felt too. 

01:52:00
KATE Yes. 

01:52:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It was like, this is important in my life. This is what, that makes life real and it's what makes life alive, I think. 

01:52:10
KATE Yes, yes, yes. 

01:52:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Both the sadness and the love. 

01:52:15
KATE Yes. 

01:52:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The depth of the feelings. 

01:52:20
KATE Mm-mm. Mm-mm. 

01:52:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And I think what I was, um, in the session with you, trying to do was to help you move towards the grief...(crosstalk) 

01:52:30
KATE Yeah. 

01:52:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ... rather than away from it, which is what we, in unsupported ways, we tend to just cope by trying to put these difficult feelings away, rather than weather the grief or whatever, confusion, uh, anxiety, depression, we try and lock them away somewhere. And then they just, kind of, lay, hang along, hang around, somehow we do it ourselves. Whereas, if we can actually, um, learn to welcome them and embrace them, then I think that what you're describing is, is a wonderful example of how enriching what, it's a painful process. 

01:53:15
KATE It is. 

01:53:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But where it takes you is just amazing. 

01:53:20
KATE Mm-mm. And I did need to a homeopathic remedy. 

01:53:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I'm sure. I'm sure you, you, well you've done, I know that you have, uh, done other things. 

01:53:25
KATE Yes. 

01:53:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That session was only one thing. 

01:53:30
KATE Sure. 

01:53:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Uh, you've done other, plenty of other things. 

01:53:35
KATE Yes, I have. Yes, yeah. All of it is important cause I, you know, I guess it's just occurred to me now, really, cause I am, uh, very independent person, um, but the session with you also showed me that actually it would be very helpful if I asked for some help. And, um, so I did see a counsellor for a while. Although, not necessarily about the issues that we were talking about, interestingly; they, they were further out in the web. Um, but they were very useful. Um, then my Shamanic work. And, yes, I, the homeopathic remedy, cause I felt I'd got something, I thought it was an infection locked in my chest; in fact, it was grief. 

01:54:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

01:54:20
KATE So, um, the remedy actually helped again, uh, to allow it to flow. 

01:54:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And I, I think that's, uh, I would always recommend people work with their body, as well. 

01:54:35
KATE Yes. 

01:54:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH In various ways, yeah. I certainly do that. I have my own therapy, but I also have a body worker and I go for other, you know, a number of, uh, body work treatments. 

01:54:45
KATE Mm-mm, yes. 

01:54:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Kinesiology, nutrition, chiropractor. 

01:54:50
KATE Yes, I've a regular massage. 

01:54:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And I too, yes, I do, as well, yes, which, a lot of, um, emotions can come up in that too. 

01:55:00
KATE Ah, boy, yes. Cause it helps with they're moved from where they're held. Yes. 

01:55:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The other thing, actually, is that I did think, uh, a couple of times when you've been talking, is about the process. Cause you described that you watched the session and you thought well you didn't do that much on, on home, was it? 

01:55:20
KATE Yeah. 

01:55:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But in fact...(crosstalk) 

01:55:20
KATE I actually have. 

01:55:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH You actually have. And I think, in many ways, that's also been my experience in my personal deve-, with my self-development. Um, that something will come up in a session, I may forget about it for a while, but then it might resonate later on and realize that, actually, without particularly, consciously thinking, oh, I'm gonna do this or that, it's come through and I've done, I have done this and that. And, and it has, um, I've got to a very different place. 

01:55:50
KATE Yes. 

01:55:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Which is a, kind of, I don't know, it's a, it's a difficult process to explain and because it is so woven into the fabric...(crosstalk) 

01:56:05
KATE It is very woven, um... 

01:56:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It's almost like you throw something into, into the river. 

01:56:10
KATE Yes. 

01:56:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And in it, we sense the river. 

01:56:15
KATE Yes. 

01:56:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then, further on down, there's some effect of that, but you can't really see exactly how the effect had its, had its impact. 

01:56:30
KATE Yes, that's, um, the mystery of life, cause there's so much that goes on that we're not entirely conscious of. 

01:56:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

01:56:40
KATE Yeah. 

01:56:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah and it's, it's very complex. 

01:56:45
KATE Mm-mm. 

01:56:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH But nevertheless though, there are, I would say there's one simple thing, which is that if we shut away from our feel-, difficult feelings, which is the way that we naturally defend against them, if we don't have support or if we haven't had training and education, then that leads to a certain kind of place; whereas, if we, instead of doing that, learn how to embrace these difficult feelings, then that leads to a very different kind of place. 

01:57:15
KATE Mm-hmm. And the word that you used, digestion, and I remember saying, what do you mean by that? Um, but that stayed with me, that word stayed with me, as well. Um, so I was thinking, oh, well, am I digesting, am I tasting it, am I sensing it, am I being willing to chew on it? It's that, kind of, thing. Mm-mm. 

01:57:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH What's your answer to that? 

01:57:45
KATE Um... 

01:57:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Over the last couple of years? 

01:57:45
KATE Oh, much more willing. Yeah, much more willing. Um, yes, it's, there is value in exploration. Um, and, um, it doesn't work to ignore it. It just doesn't, yeah. 

01:58:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It doesn't work and it, well, it works in a sense. 

01:58:10
KATE In a, sort of, sense, but, but only short term. 

01:58:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Only short term and also, it depends on where you want to get to really. 

01:58:15
KATE Yes. 

01:58:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH If you're want to get to the place you're describing ...(crosstalk) 

01:58:20
KATE That's right. 

01:58:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...then you have to, you have to do the digestion. 

01:58:25
KATE Yes. 

01:58:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I makes people want to say I, I want that place. 

01:58:25
KATE Yes. 

01:58:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I want that very special place. I want to feel like a really special person. 

01:58:30
KATE Yes. Yeah. And it is interesting to arrive at a place where I can hear you say that now and go, actually I am, but not from a place of ego. It's just, yeah, I'm a special person and so are you, and so are you and, and, and it, it is important that we find our place, find our place, and find our, and give expression to who we are, and give expression to the gifts that we have. 

01:59:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. Yeah, that's, that's, that sounds very important too. There's something in that, what is it for me? It's about, um, I think I was in conversation with one of my colleagues the other day about, I was doing a self-development DVD and, uh, she said one of the criticisms that people have of counselling is that it's all very much about the self, you know, and why spend all this money on yourself and all this, kind of, stuff. And I was saying, well, actually, when you're looking after yourself, because the self isn't an individual thing, it's also about all the people in your life. 

01:59:40
KATE Yes it is. 

01:59:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And she was saying that, she gave the example of somebody might say, well, you know, I'm a mother and I should be spending money on my children's, uh, shoes, not on going to counselling. I would say, yeah, yeah, you gotta spend money on your children's shoes, but also working with yourself and caring for yourself, and counselling can be very good for that, is also about the children too. 

02:00:00
KATE It is. 

02:00:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Cause you're not just an individual self, you're in relation with all these people. 

02:00:05
KATE Yes. 

02:00:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, if you change, that really affects, I'm sure the people in your life have benefited from, well, you're already benefiting people now. 

02:00:15
KATE I am, yes, yes. 

02:00:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And I think that's something to do with the specialness, really. That you have to really feel you're worth loving. 

02:00:25
KATE Yes, yeah. 

02:00:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And if you can love yourself, you can love, love other people well, and I think the thing about, you know, it's, there's a difference between what you just said, which is I'm special and you are special too, and, and wanting to be the most special person in the world that everyone looks up to; which I think has got something to do with, you know, issues in childhood about not being valued really. That's the opposite of not being valued and not being loved. So, some people are driven to try and find that kind of specialness, but it's not a real specialness. 

02:01:00
KATE No. 

02:01:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Because it's not based on real relationship, it's based upon, you know, being...(crosstalk) 

02:01:05
KATE Being better than. 

02:01:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Being better than or being praised or whatever and that's not a real relationship. 

02:01:10
KATE No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. The, the most and, I don't know about you, but there's been times in my, my life when I've, I've tried and I've been trying to be, to get everything really, really well and to be on time and, you know, be kind of, I'm trying not to use the word perfect and wanting to be, but there's something of that. And then, it's always been, um, slightly irritating when I've been late or something's happened. Just a couple of days ago, I think, I've been making mistakes and somebody said, well, it's great to know you're human. There's that. It's much easier to relate to a human being. 

02:01:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah. 

02:01:55
KATE With the grief, with the pain, with the whatever, um, it actually allows people to be able to relate, then having it all handled. So, it actually, um, so you said, yes, so I've affected people, but I've wor-, been aware of if, when I've been willing to be, to express the pain and the grief that it actually allows others to express their pain and grief. 

02:02:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Well, it shows them that, it shows them that you, you can touch into this. 

02:02:30
KATE Yes. 

02:02:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And, and not get overwhelmed. 

02:02:35
KATE Yes. 

02:02:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH That actually it's an important part of your life. 

02:02:40
KATE Yeah. 

02:02:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And therefore, they don't have to be in the, that dark, or that place where it feels very closed off. 

02:02:50
KATE Mm-hmm. 

02:02:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It doesn't have to mean that, grief doesn't have to mean that at all. 

02:02:55
KATE No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No, it doesn't. Mm-mm. 

02:03:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, in a way, one of the things I think I mentioned in that session was, um, about the changing the meaning of words. 

02:03:10
KATE Right. 

02:03:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH One was digestion, which has come to mean something different for you. 

02:03:15
KATE Yes. 

02:03:15
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And grief has come to mean something different for me, for you. 

02:03:20
KATE Yes, it has. Yeah. 

02:03:20
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And so has home. 

02:03:25
KATE Yes. Yeah. Yes. 

02:03:25
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I think there's some key words in our consciousness, in our lives in our consciousness. So, can, the meaning of them can really change for some, in, in, in a very substantial and deep way. 

02:03:40
KATE Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

02:03:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And then we, and then, there's another, actually in this conversation with this colleague about self-development , she was saying, well do people really change? And, uh, it's quite a philosophical question there. But, but certainly in those terms, that these are very important aspects of self in life and they've changed for you. 

02:04:05
KATE Yes. Mm-mm. Yes. Yeah, they've changed for me such that I'm now, uh, very excited about the next 30 years. You know, I'm gonna be working until I'm 90 and then I'll write the book and then I'll, um, you know, die somewhere between 95-100, um, we'll see. But nevertheless, uh, life's exciting. That's what I'm saying. 

02:04:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It sounds really wonderful. I have this, I have this very, real colorful picture. And, again, I do feel as though, you know, in that last session, do you need to see it again? I really did feel I saw this very special person and it feels as though that something's just fallen away. Like it's an old skin or something. 

02:04:50
KATE Yes. 

02:04:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Just fallen off and here you, here's this person that I can see. Here you are. You're, you really are living. 

02:05:00
KATE I am. Here I am. 

02:05:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH It's you. It's who you were and now in this very special place. Really looking forward to your, um, your life here on Earth...(crosstalk) 

02:05:05
KATE Yes. 

02:05:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH ...planet Earth. 

02:05:10
KATE Enjoying it now. 

02:05:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Which is, I don't know, I, I feel quite privileged actually, to be sitting here with you. 

02:05:20
KATE Thank you. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. 

02:05:25
[sil.] 

02:05:25
Kate's therapeutic change 

02:05:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Right at the center of counselling and psychotherapy is the concept of therapeutic change, which essentially is the way in which someone develops themselves, moves forward, achieves the kinds of psychological goals or psychological health that, um, they may have set at the beginning of a counselling process. In this particular case, I had one session with Kate and then she followed it up with a range of work. She went to a counsellor, she had other forms of support and help from her friends, which she specifically drew upon. And she also worked with her body, including, she mentions a homeopathic remedy which was helpful to her. So, a lot of work went on between that first and only session with Kate and the review session, almost two years later. But what we can see is that quite a number of the themes and the goals that I suggested have been achieved. 

02:07:05
[sil.] 

02:07:05
therapeutic outcomes 

02:07:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Kate talks about having created for herself a very real and meaningful home. She genuinely has created the home she always wanted but never really had. She's also learned to care for herself better; perhaps, as she says, not fully but, nevertheless, she feels she is better at, at being kind, at being compassionate towards herself and perhaps within that is the quite profound transformation of her relationship with her mother. Now, Kate has a particular spiritual perspective on life and she's been able to use that perspective to transform really her experience and her relationship with her dead mother. She has transformed the relationship she had with her mother she knew and grew up with into a relationship with her mother's spirit, which is profoundly different and in which Kate feels loved as her mother's special daughter. I was quite touched when Kate talked about that. It seemed to me that, through her spiritual approach, she managed a transformation that is deeply profound, and which obviously also helps her to look after herself better, to be gentle with herself, to be mothered inside in a much more caring and kinder way. And the third of the goals that I suggested in our original session related to digestion. Kate has managed to digest those overwhelming experiences of loss to the point where, yes, she does still have a continuity with, for example, her partner in sense, in the sense that the bond, the attachment she had, she still values that. She doesn't have any contact with him in the world, but she still remembers him and she still mourns sometimes for the loss of that relationship. But, at the same time, although these losses are still there, although her sadness is still there, they don't overwhelm and that is clear. Her, her life is completely different. She is able to, as she says, that whereas when she came to that first session almost two years ago, she was finding it a struggle, she was finding herself really tired; now, she doesn't have enough time in the day, she doesn't have enough hours to get all the things done that she wants to get done. So, in terms of those three goals that I suggested at the end of listening to Kate in that first session, she has achieved a tremendous amount of therapeutic change. 

02:11:00
[sil.] 

02:11:00
the importance of being hopeful 

02:11:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Within that process, in terms of my contribution, which was important but certainly not the most important; the most important was undoubtedly what, um, Kate has done si-, in the intervening two years with her friends, with another counsellor and with her body workouts. But in terms of what I originally did in the session with her, one of the, uh, interventions I made was to try and facilitate hope and I think that that clearly was effective. In that first session, she developed some hope and that hope then leads to motivation and the desire to transform, for example, her whole sense of what is to have a home. 

02:12:00
[sil.] 

02:12:00
the importance of the real relationship 

02:12:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And the other thing I'd point to is that sense of connection. Kate refers to it in this review session and it was clearly something that she found tremendously valuable. She talks about it as a gift and I also remember it as a profound moment in which I felt I was genuinely with this other person, this beautiful person, who was sitting there in front of me. 

02:12:40
[sil.] 

02:12:40
a theory of loss and change 

02:12:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, what can we take from this? In essence, loss, bereavement, grief, sadness, they can be overwhelming. They're less overwhelming if you're with somebody, such as, a counsellor, but also a friend or family member who you can talk with and be vulnerable with. And if you stay with pain, if you stay with the pain of those feelings, if you digest them, if you learn to be kind to yourself, compassionate, loving, then over time, and it does take time, things can really change. And what Kate has done here is she's used this opportunity in, an opportunity in the sense of the moment in her life when everything was confused and in a flux; she's used that opportunity to transform certain very important aspects of her life, including, and perhaps most importantly, a real home.

Factors that contribute to therapeutic change 

02:14:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH There are two main elements to this film, a session with a client called Kate who presents with a number of losses, including bereavement and secondly, a review with her almost two years later. In that intervening period, it's very clear that Kate has achieved a tremendous amount of therapeutic change. The question is, to what extent that original session contributed to that, because it's also clear that Kate did a lot of work between those two sessions. And secondly, in terms of that first session, what were the factors that contributed to that therapeutic change? 

02:15:50
[sil.] 

02:15:50
the medical model 

02:15:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH In the traditional medical model, which is also applied to mental health, there is a doctor and a patient and a treatment. And within that model, the only real active ingredient is the treatment. In other words, the only factors that contribute to therapeutic change are those to do with the treatment. In this model, the doctor can be any doctor, so long as they're competent to make an assessment and then choose an effective treatment. And again, in this model, the patient can be any patient; it doesn't really matter, because the patient is essentially passive. The patient receives the treatment from the doctor and that treatment is either more or less effective. 

02:16:55
[sil.] 

02:16:55
a new model of therapeutic change 

02:16:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now this session that you're going to watch, doesn't really have either an assessment or a treatment. The factors that contribute to therapeutic change, therefore, are not primarily to do with any treatment. So, what are the active ingredients, the factors that contribute to the therapeutic change? According to recent research on counselling and psychotherapy, together with the treatment there are three other categories of factors that contribute to therapeutic change. The most important of them is actually the client or the patient. 

02:17:45
[sil.] 

02:17:45
client factors 

02:17:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The research suggests that there are a number of client factors that contribute to therapeutic change and two of the most important of them are hope and distress tolerance or staying with pain. For a client to be able to work on their issues, to work on their therapeutic change, they need hope; without hope, very little is going to happen. So, recently, particularly, there has been a big focus on hope and how that can be facilitated by the counsellor or the psychotherapist in the therapeutic session. With respect to distress tolerance or staying with pain, again this is really a client factor. To what extent can this client cope with difficult feelings, distressful feelings?

relationship factors 

02:18:45
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Another very important category of factors that contribute to therapeutic change is that of the relationship. For a long time, the researchers have acknowledged the importance of the therapeutic relationship, but recently they've begun to look more closely and Charles Gelso, for example, has identified three distinct but connected elements. The first of these is the working alliance. The second, the transference/countertransference relationship. And the third, what he calls the real relationship. 

02:19:30

02:19:30
the working alliance 

02:19:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now the first of these, the working alliance, is in essence that process of collaborating in a consensual way with the client on working towards therapeutic goals. 

02:19:50

02:19:50
transference and countertransference 

02:19:50
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The second of these elements of the, um, therapeutic relationship is that of transference and countertransference. Now, these are quite technical terms and, in my experience, they're only overtly present in the middle phase or, particularly, the conflict phase of the therapeutic relationship. Put simply, transference is an experience by the client of the counsellor or psychotherapist as someone other than the counsellor or psychotherapist; so, in classical psychoanalysis it's re-exper-, or misperceiving the, the psychoanalyst as, for example, a mother or father. And countertransference, countertransference is more complicated in that it has a number of definitions. The definition that I find valuable, or most valuable, is the reaction of the practitioner, the counsellor or psychotherapist, the reaction in them to the experience of being transferred onto. The experience of being misperceived is quite disturbing and we tend to react in non-therapeutic ways to those transferences. Working with a countertransference is, in essence, moving from reacting to responding. In other words, becoming aware, self-aware, of the react-, reacting, reacting within myself and going beyond that and, for me, the objective in that type of work is enabling the client to untangle the transference from the real relationship with the counsellor. In other words, to untangle, for example, the, the projected mother from, or in my case perhaps the projected father, from me as the counsellor.

02:21:55
the real relationship 

02:22:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Now, the third element that Gelso identifies he calls the real relationship. And this has had a number of other terms and certainly Rogers talks about it in terms of the, um, client, the, the, the counsellor being genuine, being present and there being a, a real connection or person-to-person experience between client and counsellor. Gelso points out, through research, the importance of the real relationship in terms of a contributing factor to therapeutic change. In other words, the real relationship is actually important for therapeutic change, for, for therapeutic outcomes. And, again, in this session and the subsequent review, you'll see both the connection, the person-to-person connection that we, the deep and profound person-to-person connection that we, that I and Kate make in that session. Then, in the review, her referencing that as really very, very important. 

02:23:10

02:23:10
treatment factors 

02:23:10
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH According to the research, therefore, the latest research, there are these different categories of factors that contribute to therapeutic change. The factors that are termed treatment, which cover techniques, skills, interventions, they are important, but they're less important than those of the client, the client factors. The relationship factors are also important and then there is one other fourth category to do with the practitioner or the therapist. 

02:23:55
[sil.] 

02:23:55
practitioner factors 

02:23:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH The practitioner is also important; in particular, the practitioner, the particular self-awareness and self-development that a practitioner, for example, brings to the work. There are other factors as well, related to the practitioner which could include training, supervision and other issues to do with their particular ways of thinking, their cultural preferences, etc., but self-development and self-awareness are critical. 

02:24:35

02:24:35
my own self development 

02:24:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH In this particular session, my own self-development or the self-development I had previously undertaken over a number of years is very, very important. From my perspective, there is no way that I could sit there with Kate listening to her so well if I'd not worked on my own experiences of loss and bereavement; experiences that needed, I needed to have worked through so that they didn't overwhelm me in that session. If I'd still gotten them all frozen away, listening to Kate might well trigger the defrosting process, which would be really, probably the worst possible outcome for the session.

the death of my brother 

02:25:30
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I have experienced bereavement, not of my parents as yet, but my brother died when I was five and that had a profound impact on me, although I didn't really realize it until I began to work, do my own counselling and psychotherapy. 

02:25:50

02:25:50
the loss of childhood friends 

02:25:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH I also was moved from place to place as my father followed and advanced his career. There were, well, very important losses for me that were repeated. I would make friends in each place and then I would lose them. And, again, it wasn't until later in my late 20s that I through, through coming to a difficult place to my life, place where I felt depressed and anxious, it wasn't until then that I realized that these earlier losses of my friends were shaping my anxiety and depression. In many ways, I discovered the sadness of the past had frozen into my depression and the anxiety associated with being moved from place to place was still there. 

02:26:55

02:26:55
relationship breakup 

02:26:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH And all of this, for me, was triggered in my early 20s when I lost, when I broke up with my first love. That was very, very painful in itself, but what I later realized was that it opened up the freezer; it switched off the electricity and the whole lot defrosted and I felt totally overwhelmed and completely, completely confused and swept away by grief, by sadness, by anx-, by anger and by anxiety.

empathic listening 

02:27:40
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So, by the time I came to the session with Kate, I had already worked a great deal on these losses and the subsequent implications of them and I was able to sit there and be with Kate in the fullness of her grief; something that she found very valuable and which was, as I say, entirely dependent on the fact that I'd worked on my own loss and bereavement.

Introduction to bereavement and loss 

02:29:05
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Loss is really at the heart of our lives. Whether we like it or not, we all experience a range of losses throughout our lives. The most obvious of these are the losses of close relationships, our parents, perhaps a partner in a breakup or divorce, friends, other family members, even colleagues at work; some of them die, all of them die at some point, some of them just move on, some of them breakup in a lot of pain. 

02:29:55

02:29:55
distress tolerance 

02:29:55
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH So loss is really a part of life. It's an important part of life, something that's inescapable it's, it's an, it's an essential part of being a human being. And the way in which we react and respond to the losses in our lives is really very important. When those losses are huge, when they're, uh, for example, a bereavement or a divorce or breakup with someone that one felt very close with and loved, those types of enormous losses can be very painful. And st-, staying with those feelings can be very, very difficult. So, often it's easier, or so it feels, to put them aside in some way; if you like, to put them into a, kind of, inner refrigerator or a deep freezer or something like this, um, and that way we can, kind of, get on with our lives at that particular time in our lives, but the problem is that when we put these feelings of grief, the feelings of sadness and also other feelings of, um, perhaps anger and even anxiety, if we put them into this inside freezer, then there are two possibilities for the future. 

02:31:35

complex grief 

02:31:35
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH Firstly, we can put them in the freezer, but at some point they may defrost; at some point later in life, perhaps triggered by another experience of loss, earlier feelings can be defrosted and sweep out and over us. 

02:32:00

emotional intelligence 

02:32:00
DR. ANTHONY CROUCH There's another way in which avoiding our feelings, putting them into the deep freezer, can hurt us and hurt our lives. And that's simply that when we put the feelings into the deep freezer, we also put part of ourselves in there and that part is really an aspect of our heart. So, in other words, it's a bit like taking part of our heart and putting it into a deep freezer and we need our heart, we need our feelings with us every day. We need to be able to listen to our feelings, to our heart and while we have a part of ourselves, an important part of ourselves, frozen in the freezer, we can never really feel at home in ourselves. So, at times it may be important to put those feelings aside, in order to survive, but it's also important to give oneself the time, as soon as possible, to really feel the feelings, to really digest them.
