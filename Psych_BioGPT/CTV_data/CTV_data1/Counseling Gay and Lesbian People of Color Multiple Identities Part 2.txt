We’re about to watch a video that involves a Filipino American client who also identified as a lesbian. Um… as you watch this interaction between me and the client, pay attention to some of the techniques that I might use to help her to identify some of her feelings and to talk about her experiences a little bit more. Um… she is also an immigrant from the Philippines and she talks a lot about um… how some of the experiences of our entire community, Filipino American community, um… how those might affect her as well as her family as well. Um… so pay attention to what process you would use, um… and how would you built a rapport with this client. So, I hope you enjoy the video.

ANANG CHUVA Because I was 16… 

00:06:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:40
ANANG CHUVA …when I went to college and um… I went to Bargio(ph) that’s like a province in the Philippines, because I live around the city in Manila. So, I feel like when I was in high school, we my mom and he doesn’t have like the great, you know…

DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah and it’s just sounds like you know that your family is… split up for a lot of different reasons… 

00:07:30
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:07:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL …you know, um… maybe some of the reasons are… are… systemic because of the Philippines and how… how that is, but I wonder how that feels to have um… your families are separated in so many different places especially when you’re growing up, your father was in the States and I mean then you went to college, you’re away from your mom and now you’re here in the States, but you have his disconnect when you go back. So, what’s it like all these moving around and this family some kind of um… be in different places? 

00:08:00
ANANG CHUVA It’s like when the first time I left my home in the Philippines… 

00:08:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm…

00:08:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:15
ANANG CHUVA And then like are you really didn’t feel like the discomfort of you know knowing that everyone in your family is you know broken in terms of you know… 

00:08:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:25
ANANG CHUVA …finding… in finding work or like finding… 

00:08:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:30
ANANG CHUVA Their own um… space in the house. 

00:08:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:30
ANANG CHUVA You know, but like living here, it gives me an advantage. 

00:08:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:08:40
ANANG CHUVA Because I feel like I was you know, I feel like I was independent back home already. 

00:08:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:45
ANANG CHUVA But not really because I was depending on my parents you know. 

00:08:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:45
ANANG CHUVA Um… money asking for… for my um… day-today allowance. 

00:08:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:50
ANANG CHUVA So when I came here, I feel like you know “Oh it’s okay”, you know even though my… my mom and my dad is like working late at night and I am left all alone, but the thing is you know, in the Philippines you have support like friends… 

00:09:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:05
ANANG CHUVA …you have cousins who you know, but when I came here, it’s really different that you know, you only have your mom and your dad. 

00:09:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:15
ANANG CHUVA And then, um… looking for like community to support you… 

00:09:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:20
ANANG CHUVA …it was really hard because, we stayed for like the first few months I stayed in… 

00:09:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:25
ANANG CHUVA …my aunt, aunt’s house, which is in Long Island. 

00:09:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Oh okay. 

00:09:30
ANANG CHUVA And it’s really hard for me to see like Filipinos in there. You need to have a car, you need to know your way around and they’d no have anyone. 

00:09:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:40
ANANG CHUVA So, you know to be to just support me. 

00:09:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:40
ANANG CHUVA And then, I was… the first time I came here, it’s really depressing. 

00:09:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:45
ANANG CHUVA Because I feel so alone and I feel like… 

00:09:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:50
ANANG CHUVA I didn’t know my… my dad you know for like the 17 years of living, I didn’t know him all along, he is here. 

00:09:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:00
ANANG CHUVA You know, and then my mom was like working all night also. 

00:10:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:00
ANANG CHUVA So it was like… It was like this puzzle for me to… 

00:10:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:10:05
ANANG CHUVA Like you know, put it back together. 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:10
ANANG CHUVA Even if you’re altogether… 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:10
ANANG CHUVA …yourself broken, yeah. 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL All those years apart. 

00:10:15
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL You said that you felt really alone during those times. 

00:10:15
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Can you talk a little bit more about how you dealt with all those feelings? 

00:10:20
ANANG CHUVA Um… I tried to work like after um… like few weeks… 

00:10:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:25
ANANG CHUVA I tried to look for a job and I was like… I was trying to get myself busy. 

00:10:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:30
ANANG CHUVA Going online you know, talking to my friends back home, calling, all my salary you know just be in phone cards, you know calling back phone. 

00:10:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:45
ANANG CHUVA Ah… and I don’t even call my family. I call my friends. 

00:10:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:45
ANANG CHUVA Because I feel like, I I’m more close to them rather than my family… 

00:10:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:55
ANANG CHUVA Because all like I’m not believe like the culture in the Filipino and in our family like our relationship between our family it’s very aloof. 

00:11:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:05
ANANG CHUVA And it’s really hard for me to open up with them. 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:11:10
ANANG CHUVA And like um… being with friends it’s really, it’s easier. So when I… when I came here being alone is like… it’s really, it’s hard. 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. So I mean it’s sounds like you went through a lot when you first came here to the States and… 

00:11:25
ANANG CHUVA Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL …um… having to leave back home, who was there, your friends and even your family, um… that was back there and adjusting to the new life in the way the new life style here in the US. It’s sounds like you know, you… you tried to keep yourself busy and that’s what I think, but I… I’m trying to understand a little bit more about um… how does it feel when you feel depressed or alone like you said what are some of the thing that feelings that you experience? 

00:11:50
ANANG CHUVA Like my depression, um… lasted for like three years. 

00:11:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:55
ANANG CHUVA I was like counting every minute of the… like days, how long… 

00:12:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:12:00
ANANG CHUVA …I’ve been here like every friends that I… I… met they are like you know, so because the first thing that…that like Filipinos, the first thing they will ask you when you are here. How long have you been here? 

00:12:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:15
ANANG CHUVA And when you say like few weeks, you’ve been like when you say numbers, you feel like you know “Oh I’ve been here for that long.” 

00:12:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:25
ANANG CHUVA And what did you do, what have you been accomplished, what have you been… 

00:12:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:12:25
ANANG CHUVA …you know doing and I feel like those numbers. 

00:12:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
ANANG CHUVA That I like keep on saying, I feel like the more I think about it, the more depressed I’m. 

00:12:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:40
ANANG CHUVA Because I feel like you know that… that long time… 

00:12:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:12:45
ANANG CHUVA …of staying here and not knowing, you know like… like knowing your families like this. 

00:12:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:50
ANANG CHUVA Like broken into like different pieces. 

00:12:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:12:55
ANANG CHUVA You know, it’s really hard to really understand to… 

00:13:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:00
ANANG CHUVA comprehend, but the things like for that three years, it helped me grow. 

00:13:05

00:14:25
ANANG CHUVA Hmm… 

00:14:25

ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL That someone else had gone through a thing and in fact a lot of people have gone through some of the experiences that you have um… and then it you know I think sometimes it’s really helpful to feel like you’re not the only one. 

00:14:40
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:14:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. As you talk about this now as you said that was for three years and that was when you first got here, um… what’s it… how do you feel talking about those times?

00:15:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:15:15
ANANG CHUVA …about it. Like not only being a transplant in here. 

00:15:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:20
ANANG CHUVA But feeling like you know being a woman… 

00:15:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:25
ANANG CHUVA …being a lesbian and being you know youth… 

00:15:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:25
ANANG CHUVA …being like you don’t have any… any support in the community or anything like, you know… 

00:15:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Its Right. 

00:15:35
ANANG CHUVA …all those barriers… 

00:15:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:35
ANANG CHUVA …being a Filipino in New York, it’s hard. 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:15:40
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, but it sounds like you want to help those… 

00:15:40
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL …that come here and because you know how hard it was like that. Um… I want to hear a little bit more about your story, you know, you said that um… you’ve had some struggles here because you, to… to speak the language as well in back home, you speak the language and so, that’s less stressful for you, I mean it’s right now, you told me just mention that you identify as a lesbian. 

00:16:05
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:16:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um… what are some of the daily stressors that you experience as a result of… of all these identities that you have? 

00:16:10
ANANG CHUVA Like I just came out um… 2006, so when I came here like that three months… 

00:16:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:20
ANANG CHUVA …like knowing all those barriers, and then 2006 I came out, and I was really like after dealing with your depression of feeling alone, you have another thing that you need to come out like… 

00:16:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:30
ANANG CHUVA Yet you feeling like being a lesbian, and then not coming out as you know as a lesbian in the Filipino community, it’s hard, but all those barriers… 

00:16:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:45
ANANG CHUVA Like I… I feel like I didn’t handle it well. 

00:16:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:55
ANANG CHUVA Like in terms of you know being a lesbian and I didn’t explore much. 

00:16:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:55
ANANG CHUVA Because I have this um… cultural tendency of you know, um… seeing relationship as you know, a straight relationship… 

00:17:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:10
ANANG CHUVA …instead of being um… it’s a different one. 

00:17:10

00:17:10
ANANG CHUVA You know, and then having all those um… another barriers of being a woman…

00:17:20
ANANG CHUVA …not only being a lesbian, also woman… 

00:17:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:20
ANANG CHUVA …in terms of how Filipino Community see you not as a lesbian, but as a woman. 

00:17:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, hmm…hmm… and then the combination of those things… 

00:17:30
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:17:30

00:17:35

00:29:45
ANANG CHUVA Yeah. 

00:29:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL …and at vain(ph) or individualistic. Um… but you know I think that there is a way where we can think about our people and the community, um… but also take care of ourselves and it sounds like you’re able to do that.

00:31:38
ANANG CHUVA Hmm…
