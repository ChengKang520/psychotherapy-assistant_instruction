Counseling for depression 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOTT So counseling for depression is a recently developed model uh… that comes out of uh… work on humanistic therapy competencies and is being delivered umm… in, in a training format in various parts of the UK and Wales currently. The counseling for depression model uh… is an attempt to find a kind of sweet spot between more traditional person centered therapy or counseling and emotion focused therapy. Uh… and this sweet spot is been described as umm… EFT without furniture humoursly by, by Pete Sanders umm… but it's, it… the CFD model or counseling for depression model includes uh… or umm… suggests that with depression uh… therapists and counselors need to be process guiding, they need to be actively collaborative with clients. They need to think in terms of tasks, the kind of work that clients bring uh… that depressed clients bring. Umm… and, so it's a kind of EFT light model, if I… I hope I can… I'm not offending people by saying that but umm… and, but EFT was initially developed as a treatment for depression and as the CFD model's been sort of uh… put forward in the UK umm… it's caused me to go back and reflect on the early research I did in the late 1980's uh… on working on… working with depression and this is really the place that EFT was developed, so we developed EFT as a therapy for depression and uh… people like Greenberg, and Goldman, and Watson, and other have published on emotion focused therapy for depression but in my reflection on all these developments umm… I've gone back and looked at my earlier work on, on EFT for depression and I've got some thoughts about depression that I'd like to share briefly here. Uh… the first thing is that I think uh… it's useful to think of depression as a form of stuckness, so stuckness, the person gets stuck, they fall into their depression and they can't get out of it, and I think this is actually from a phenomenal logical point of, point of view of client's experience that's actually quite a useful concept to think about depression as a form of stuckness. Uh… the extent to which we get stuck in our lives, we can't move forward towards accomplishing important life goals or projects uh… we will become depressed. I think that's a kind of natural response to, to stuckness, so umm… certainly I see depression as, as a form of stuckness and uh… one of… that, one of that things that means is that the first job of a counselor working with depression is not to get stuck with your clients, and as I've listened to some uh… recordings recently of counselors working with depression uh… I had a kind of flashback to the late 1980's when we were doing our work with depression and our clients would come in every weekend, they'd… one client was depressed 'cause his kids hated him, someone else lost their job, someone else's relationship fell apart, and the clients just were stuck in this process uh… feeling like a failure and feeling a sense of loss and so they really got stuck, and I can remember feelings stuck with my clients at that time. And, struggling to figure out how to get unstuck, so I think the counselor's first job in working with depression is to not get stuck with your clients, it's actually uh… to get out of that, and the question is how we do that. Well, the first thing is to realize that stuckness is the depression, so it's not just that my client is stuck and then we all get depressed. It's like that is the depression and that uh… if you're depressed, if you're clinically depressed it feels like it's just fallen out of the sky and hit you on the head. A bad thing happened, you had a failure of some kind and uh… it's all about that and there's nothing you can do about it and… but you're not happy with it and you just go round and round in circles, so uh… so it feels like something had happened to you and in fact from an EFT point of view depression is something that we do to ourselves. No, I don't mean this in a judgmental way in any kind of manner but umm… you know, if I get depressed umm… as a, as opposed to feeling, injured or um… feeling sad or something like that but if I get the stuck, get depressed there's a process, there's something in me that's maintaining that sense of depression, so basically I'm depressing myself or part of me is depressing me and so instead of seeing the stuckness as something that just happens that we can't do anything about, it's more like it's a process that generates so that person's continually constructing their depression and their stuckness, and so the therapists wants to see how that happens, how does the client depresses himself? How's that work? Uh… now there are two main tasks that depress clients present umm… there are other ones too but the main ones are uh… self criticism uh… which is organized around a sense of failure and not living up to one's standards and uh… unresolved relationships or grief, you know, unresolved grief or unresolved broken relationships uh… which in EFT we call unfinished business, so uh… most depression organizes itself around one or both of those processes, self criticism runs a sense of failure umm… or unresolved relationships uh… and so clients coming to us are presenting one or both of those, those tasks for work and that means that we're gonna be working with the self critical process which is one of the ways that people depress themselves by criticizing and running themselves down. And, or we gonna be working with unresolved relationships when the person feels stuck 'cause they can't do anything about the relationship so they get stuck in a sort of, uh… uh… unresolved emotional pain. Umm… so those are the tasks we're gonna be working with and then umm… the process of depressing by self often involves emotional blockage uh… or interrupting or cutting off your emotions in feeling stuck. Uh… and that's gonna be… that's, that's related the self, the self criticism process umm… and we're gonna work with that uh… but the main things are gonna be uh… self criticism and unfinished business. Now the critical thing if you're working with depression and you hear self criticism is to hear the different voices of the client, so we commonly don't realize that when clients uh… depressed clients have multiple kind of ways of talking or aspects of self or voices uh… parts of self, these, these phenomena has many different names but, but umm… it's really important to tune or train our ears with our depressed clients to hear the voice of the critic. The voice, voice saying, "You're failure, it's your fault. You should never have done that, you're bad person. You're weak." all the different things these critical voices say and then hear the, hear the reaction the person has to that, that's the voice we call the experiencer, that's the part they get to criticize, that's the part that says, "I feel so bad, I feel so low. I can't do anything, I'm stuck." And that's the collapsed experiencer, so in depression it's not just that we criticize ourselves 'cause all of us criticize ourselves, we all have intro critics, but in depression the difference is that we don't fight back, we don't say, "Hang on, that's too harsh, you know, that's, that's not fair of me to say that I'm a total failure, I just, you know, got something wrong last night." Uh… so we… our, our experience says that more emotional part of ourselves fights back, but in, in depression the experincer agrees with the critic and they collapse, and the collapse of the experiencers they are now agreeing with the critic, that's also depression. That basically constitutes depression, so we get a collapsed experiencer who feels stuck and so a lot of working with depressions learning to hear those different voices and to hear them as something that person does or says with themselves or to themselves not as just something that happened. It's not like, you know, umm… a piece of their brain broke and then they were depressed, although many people think that depression… and they're told by drug companies that depression is caused by chemical imbalance umm… in fact that's something that we, we construct in most cases. Umm… so those are some initial thoughts uh… another thought I think is that I like to use with my clients, my depressed clients is that depression, your depression is you sending a message to you that's something's broken in your life and that part of you that's sending that message is gonna keep sending that message until you listen to it, so let's listen to what the depression saying and uh… what, what brokenness in your life it's pointing to umm… to see what the unmet needs are, where you've gotten…what you… where you, where important projects have been compromised or blocked in someway? So those are few of my thoughts uh… I think depression's a really good area for, for umm… a person centered experience and emotion focused therapists to work in, I think we, we know quite a bit of how to, how to work with it.
