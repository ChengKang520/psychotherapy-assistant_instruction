Ruben Battino, MS 

00:00:30
RUBEN BATTINO Jennifer as I mentioned, before we started uh… my preferred method of working is just umm… holding a chapter with someone I never met before or at the opening just getting to know you bit better and hoping you get to know me a bit better. 

00:00:55
JENNIFER Okay, wonderful. 

00:00:55
RUBEN BATTINO And uh… then we'll go on from there. 

00:01:00
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:01:00
RUBEN BATTINO So umm… it is there umm… anything in particular that you would like to work on this afternoon, something maybe that's been bothering you for a while, something you'd like to change? 

00:01:20
JENNIFER Umm… My stress. 

00:01:30
RUBEN BATTINO You stress? 

00:01:30
JENNIFER Yeah, my anxiety. 

00:01:35
RUBEN BATTINO And uh… please keep secret and private to yourself, uh… whatever, you know, is, is important. 

00:01:45
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:01:45
RUBEN BATTINO I think, Erickson love to start the sessions with something like, please don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me. 

00:01:50
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:01:55
RUBEN BATTINO So… we just work with uh… with umm… I mean, just so…perhaps I can get a little background… 

00:02:00
JENNIFER Mm-hmm! 

00:02:05
RUBEN BATTINO …how long has this uh… stress been going on? 

00:02:10
JENNIFER Umm… really, really bad stress for the last umm… for about four months. 

00:02:25
RUBEN BATTINO About four months. 

00:02:25
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:02:30
RUBEN BATTINO And do you have uh… anything in mind that might let you know that perhaps how it started back then? And no, here you don't, uh… if you have something in mind you don't have to tell me about it. 

00:02:45
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:02:45
RUBEN BATTINO Just one of the things I, I like to do is, I said secret therapy. 

00:02:50
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:02:50
RUBEN BATTINO And I really seen my role models a guide, then someone who gets in and does things to people. 

00:03:00
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:03:00
RUBEN BATTINO Okay? 

00:03:00
JENNIFER Carry on. 

00:03:05
RUBEN BATTINO So anything more you would like to say about that's fine, otherwise we'll umm… figure out the way of getting uh… to uh… health issues a bit more calm, relax, the easy in, in your life. Okay? And uh… from, I may at some point want to comment to the audience, will that be okay? 

00:03:30
JENNIFER Yeah, of course. Please. 

00:03:30
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah, and okay, to take some doubts form time to time. 

00:03:35
JENNIFER Yeah, I'm stressed out right now. Look at my hands, how cold they are. 

00:03:35
RUBEN BATTINO Wow… 

00:03:40
JENNIFER How cold they are. 

00:03:40
RUBEN BATTINO Hmm… well, actually, in some strange way. They're actually bit warmer than my hands. 

00:03:50
JENNIFER I didn't think your hands were cold. 

00:03:50
RUBEN BATTINO So uh… from my perspective maybe that means some more stress than you are. 

00:03:55
JENNIFER No. 

00:03:55
RUBEN BATTINO And we should be verse roles immediately and I think you can uh… start helping me. In fact, umm… one of the umm… the, the things I do uh… when I when I have the sense that uh… I'm really stuck with the coin from just don't know where to go and perhaps, we uh… play that transactional analysis game of why don't you get part of the, throughout the whole bunch of ideas and they go nowhere. 

00:04:25
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:04:30
RUBEN BATTINO It is I literally switch seeds. And I play you and you play me, except that I play you tougher than you play me. And then you have to help me. 

00:04:40
JENNIFER Hmm! 

00:04:40
RUBEN BATTINO So that that's one way of, going about this is something where that might work. Umm… let me, let me also say that umm… one of the things that uh… I turn to great deal with a lot of people is uh… guided imagery, do you know what, what that process is? 

00:05:05
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:05:10
RUBEN BATTINO And umm… what I'm uh… thinking at this point, because primarily it'll be in such a way to… uh… protect you more if you will uh… would be to umm… do a guided imagery session. And umm… in my experience anytime someone goes inside themselves, maybe closes their eyes or stares off in the distance, they're in some level of trance state. And I never worry about how deep the trance state is going to be. Now if, if, if I were a surgeon and I was going to do surgery on you, then I'd worry about that, but, but we're not going to get that deep, just enough. 

00:06:00
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:06:00
RUBEN BATTINO So, uh… when I do guided imagery work there are uh… three things I always ask about that are helpful. And uh… the first is uh… have you had experience uh… doing relaxation or meditation or self-hypnosis? 

00:06:25
JENNIFER I may have never done hypnosis before. 

00:06:25
RUBEN BATTINO Not it, but about relaxation or meditation? 

00:06:30
JENNIFER Umm… yeah, I do a little bit of that my own. 

00:06:30
RUBEN BATTINO And how do you get in to uh… a meditative state? 

00:06:35
JENNIFER Umm… sometimes I just sit umm… and cross my legs and just kind of sit there and just kind of close my eyes and meditate or I lay down on a mat and just kind of Relax. 

00:06:50
RUBEN BATTINO Okay, so you do things like maybe camp numbers or, or one of the, the ways that that uh… I find works with most people just uh… paying attention to breathing. 

00:07:00
JENNIFER Yeah, I, definitely, I do that. 

00:07:05
RUBEN BATTINO So that that would work. 

00:07:05
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:07:10
RUBEN BATTINO Umm… and just getting back to the idea of, of uh… hypnosis… 

00:07:15
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15
RUBEN BATTINO …I have a very simplified definition as to what hypnosis is and it's just focused attention. 

00:07:20
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:07:25
RUBEN BATTINO So, any time your attention is so focused on something that the world around you kind of disappears, you're in some level of trance state. And I'm sure you've had many experiences in your life when kind of you get working on something going to movies, listening to music… 

00:07:40
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:07:40
RUBEN BATTINO …reading a, a good book and time just disappears. 

00:07:45
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
RUBEN BATTINO So… it's, it's nothing mysterious, we do this all the time. It's not that I'm gonna do as golly kind of thing on you. So umm… second thing that that's going to be useful is uh… something I call a… uh… the safe haven. So, do you have some place within your mind that is real or imaginary that you uh… would go to, will you feel really comfortable, safe, secure and maybe even also a learning place? This could be uh… 

00:08:35
JENNIFER Well, I don't think so. 

00:08:35
RUBEN BATTINO …could be uh… where this wilderness home uh… 

00:08:35
JENNIFER Oh! 

00:08:35
RUBEN BATTINO …beach uh… 

00:08:40
JENNIFER Actually I do. Umm… yeah, the beach. 

00:08:40
RUBEN BATTINO The beach. 

00:08:40
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:08:40
RUBEN BATTINO Okay. 

00:08:45
JENNIFER Actually in my office, I, my office is umm… beach themed. 

00:08:50
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, wonderful! 

00:08:50
JENNIFER And I have pictures of umm… the Oregon coast. 

00:08:55
RUBEN BATTINO The Oregon coast. 

00:08:55
JENNIFER And… yes. And I have uh… the Manzanita beach, I have some pictures of… 

00:09:00
RUBEN BATTINO I pardon, can you say that again? 

00:09:00
JENNIFER Manzanita beach. Manzanita-Oregon. 

00:09:05
RUBEN BATTINO Manda… 

00:09:05
JENNIFER Manzanita. 

00:09:10
RUBEN BATTINO Manzanita beach. Okay. 

00:09:10
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:09:10
RUBEN BATTINO Well, I guess I am… 

00:09:10
JENNIFER And I love that, I love that place a lot. So yes, I do go there. Mm-hmm! 

00:09:15
RUBEN BATTINO I guess uh… I'm feeling fortunate, because uh… about two years ago my wife and I drove all way down the Oregon beaches and wonderful places, okay, good stuff. 

00:09:25
JENNIFER Yes. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm! 

00:09:30
RUBEN BATTINO And uh… the uh… the third thing that that's going to be useful is umm… do you have some kind of uh… internal sense or feeling as to what method of mortality or perhaps uh… maybe uh… a kind of spiritual person could help you and be with you and help you just get rid of all of these restful feelings so they just go away? 

00:10:10
JENNIFER Spiritual or… 

00:10:15
RUBEN BATTINO Pardon. 

00:10:15
JENNIFER See, you said spiritual or… hmm… 

00:10:20
RUBEN BATTINO It could be umm… and so in my experience people chose things like the healing hands, healing light, uh… healing touch uh… religious people choose Jesus the Holy Spirit or… 

00:10:35
JENNIFER Yeah, well, I am Catholic. I umm… I'm religious so I use that umm… 

00:10:40
RUBEN BATTINO So with the Holy Spirit perhaps work. 

00:10:45
JENNIFER Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! Yeah, definitely. 

00:10:50
RUBEN BATTINO Good, good. So umm… and oh, one other thing umm… 

00:10:55
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:11:00
RUBEN BATTINO …you were so nice to reach out and hold my hands at the beginning. 

00:11:00
JENNIFER Yeah, I like to, such people. 

00:11:05
RUBEN BATTINO I, I wonder if, if it would be okay, if perhaps sometimes during this session that we're working with, if uh… if I asked you, if you would be okay, just to reach out and hold your hand as part of the process? 

00:11:20
JENNIFER Oh, sure. Yeah, definitely. 

00:11:25
RUBEN BATTINO Okay, cool good, wonderful. Okay, so umm… let's just start with that. 

00:11:25
JENNIFER Chat. 

00:11:25
RUBEN BATTINO Yes. 

00:11:25
JENNIFER Yes. 

00:11:30
RUBEN BATTINO Umm… I should say umm… perhaps you might be interested in this that umm… I get into guided imagery work, because my volunteer work from perhaps the last 20 or 25 years has been with people have life challenging diseases. And guided imagery work has proven to be very helpful people who have serious ailments. And though started by the Simonton's many years ago, it's become one of the, the standard ways of doing things. So umm… so yeah, so I had a lot of experience doing this kind of stuff. 

00:12:15
JENNIFER Hmm… it's nice. 

00:12:15
RUBEN BATTINO And uh… I'm really glad that it's stress and not something else. That's uh… that's probably… more manageable and may even ask you now uh… perhaps how surprised would you be, if all this stuff disappeared in one little session this afternoon? 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:45
RUBEN BATTINO I should also say… 

00:12:45
JENNIFER It'll be amazing, I'd cry. 

00:12:50
RUBEN BATTINO Okay, cool. 

00:12:50
JENNIFER It'll be amazing. 

00:12:50
RUBEN BATTINO My, my personal philosophy is that uh… I always have hope and I believe in miracles. And uh… in my work with people have serious diseases, I've seen enough miracles like, people walking out of hospice that uh… 

00:13:05
JENNIFER Wow. 

00:13:10
RUBEN BATTINO …so things like that can happen, okay. 

00:13:15
JENNIFER That's amazing. 

00:13:15
RUBEN BATTINO So if you're comfortable now, I know these chairs aren't the most comfortable to find a way of being a bit more comfortable and maybe take a sip of water. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:30
JENNIFER Thank you. 

00:13:35
RUBEN BATTINO And umm… feeling comfortable closing your eyes, finding your nice way uh… good. Anyways, I said earlier, you know, uh… if you feel comfortable closing your eyes, please do that otherwise just look off from the distance. I usually like to starting, we're just asking people to just pay attention to their breathing. Just noticing each breath as it comes in 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
RUBEN BATTINO And then goes out. With each inhale chest, belly softly rising. And then with each exhale, all of those muscles just relax, just one breath at a time, one heartbeat at a time, softly, easily and simply. And occasionally Jennifer, the stray thought may wander through your mind. Notice it. Thank you for being there. And then just go back to this breath and the next one. And if I don't use just the right words or images this afternoon, please feel free to change them so that they are just the right words or images that you need to help yourself this afternoon. Here you can notice the way that your hands are on your thighs, the way your feet make contact with the floor, this breath of the next one. And within your mind now, you can just drift off to Manzanita Beach. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:30
RUBEN BATTINO And you know that place very well. Do you not? Yeah, wonderful place, sand, the ocean and sky, I don't know it in particular but it, it's not unusual to be a beach where there are all rocky outcrops here and there. Just off to beach. And there may be some of those marvelous white fluffy clouds floating around. And then there are the waves coming in, slowly rolling up the beach, reaching up tipping over, sliding up the sand and then just sinking into the sand, going back out to the water, there maybe some sea birds around maybe. Some other sounds besides to serve. Wind just the right, wind, temperature of the sun just, just warm enough maybe. A little bit of a breeze occasionally. And something interesting is going to happen. As you're on the beach, breathing easily and calmly, you become aware that somewhere near you is the Holy Spirit. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
RUBEN BATTINO And the Holy Spirit as you know is knowledgeable, powerful, a healer. Great sense of love, compassion, sensitivity. And the Holy Spirit is coming a bit closer. And you can sense its presence. Can you not? And in some way, the Holy Spirit is able to reach out and touch you gently. You can feel that contact, that sense of connection to the Holy Spirit, 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
RUBEN BATTINO To the surroundings, to the sky, almost extending all the way out to the universe. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:20
RUBEN BATTINO And the Holy Spirit knows, just where within you to send its loving compassion, knowledge, to find just those places within your body that need what? Calming, sense of peace, the sense of yourself of knowing deeply who you are and being able to reinforce from your toes all the way up to the here on the top of your head. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
RUBEN BATTINO This inner sense of… yeah. It's okay, I'm okay. Whatever it is that had been troubling you is somehow from this contact. Presence of the Holy Spirit just gets washed away, cleanse, just like the way the wave rules up the beach, the sands gets cleansed, footsteps, bird feet marking on the sand, they, they just get even doubts so the sand again becomes smooth, clear, calm and ready for whatever is coming next. Maybe somebody walking on the beach, maybe, somebody with a dog perhaps running into the water and to now along the beach leaving little footprints. Just as you have lived in your life many footprints here and there. And it's good to know that you've left footprints here and there. There are more that you're going to the, sort of like what, leaving your mark on the world, leaving your impressions calmly, easily, naturally, one breath at a time, one heartbeat at a time. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:05
RUBEN BATTINO And I'm going to ask if it is okay, at this point. Jennifer, I just put out my hands and you put out your hands and we make contact so that would be okay to hold your hand. And if it is okay, reach out and if at this point that is not okay, please just stay in the presence of the Holy Spirit. And in some interesting ways, somehow, I don't know how, the Holy Spirit is able to reach into your own spirit, your essence, your soul, your mind. And it may be that there are some wiring that needs to be rearranged in your brain some different connection and maybe that some memories who would be useful to modify or change or even forget. And the Holy Spirit knows in its infinite wisdom and compassion and love, just exactly what to do and how to do that and how to rearrange every organs and also to be able to send into your body every atom, every molecule, every cell, every tissue, every bone, every organ, every nerve, every connection, every knowing, renovating, reenergizing. re-building, re-connecting. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
RUBEN BATTINO In a way that it knows would be most helpful and most effective for you at this time, this breath and the next one. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
RUBEN BATTINO And the Holy Spirit having done His work at this time helping you in this little time of need, to achieve what ever changes be helpful and useful and realistic at this time slowly withdraws for as you know it has much more work to do. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
RUBEN BATTINO And there is that cloud floating up there, wonderful, waves coming up to beach. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
RUBEN BATTINO Perhaps, some girls making their little noises in the back ground. A Wonderful sea breeze blowing through the bushes and grass at the edge of the beach. And as you walk along now breathing calmly, easily, naturally, you're probably aware that your memory is some what like a recording machine. So that whatever words, ideas, images and sessions, experience of having been in the presence and made contact with the Holy Spirit will be with you when you need it and as you need it. And all that you would have to do when perhaps you need to re-experience this again the some time, find a quiet place. Pay attention to your breathing and you'll be able to relive and re-experience that, a smile, a touch, joy, the moon in the morning, the sun at sunset… 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:50
RUBEN BATTINO …peace and quiet. And I want to thank you Jennifer, for your attention, your trust, your confidence. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:15
RUBEN BATTINO And whenever you're ready, perhaps take a deep breath or two, maybe blink your eyes and just come on back to this room, here and now. Thank you. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:50
RUBEN BATTINO Wow. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
RUBEN BATTINO One of the uh… experiences of going through something like this is generally that you are consciously remembered. Some of the things that I said, some of the things you, that are transpired. So that umm… what typically happens when people get into these really relax states is, some word or imagery just reach out and grab. And you stay with that for a while and then some time later, my voice comes back with you again. Okay? So, just okay with you, I mean, you can say anything you want now this is your time or please keep quiet. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
JENNIFER There's a tear coming to my eyes. 

00:32:10
RUBEN BATTINO Pardon, yes. 

00:32:10
JENNIFER I said tears coming in my eyes. 

00:32:15
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah. 

00:32:15
JENNIFER It was nice. Thank you. 

00:32:15
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, thank you. All right! 

00:32:20
JENNIFER Thank you. My hands are still cool, aren't they? 

00:32:25
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, my goodness. Okay. 

00:32:25
JENNIFER I live in Phoenix, I should have warm hands, shouldn't I? 

00:32:25
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah, yeah. Uh… there is umm… one of the things that that uh… I've become uh… aware of that that's very important is umm… learned this from the, and all people is, is doing anchoring umm… providing some uh… way of uh… having a physical reminder or some way of, of touching him. Uh… I guess with uh… intent of forethought, uh… I have a little gift for you which surprisingly may be very, very appropriate. So I'm going to reach into my pocket here and what I'm holding up is the kind of stone that you might have found on Manzanita Beach. 

00:33:35
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:33:35
RUBEN BATTINO And I'd like you to have that. 

00:33:35
JENNIFER Thank you. 

00:33:40
RUBEN BATTINO So that whenever you feel that wow, I need another little bit of taking care of myself or that that will be with you. 

00:33:55
JENNIFER I appreciate that very much. Thank you. 

00:34:00
RUBEN BATTINO You're welcome. So we'll be okay if we turn to the uh… audience now and find out if they have any comments or questions or if you do. 

00:34:10
JENNIFER Yeah, that's fine, if they want to ask questions or sure. 

00:34:15
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah. And if they have something you don't want to answer, please that's what I'm here for. 

00:34:25
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:34:25
RUBEN BATTINO I make up things and I'll tell them all about that. 

00:34:25
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:34:30
RUBEN BATTINO Okay. So let's just turn a little bit uh… this way and uh… if anybody has any comments about this. Uh… they said at the, the outset, my preferred method of working with clients now and I've slowly evolved to this. And uh… I've been doing this kind of work in a way since 1978, so I've been in this business a long time. I've heard all kinds of training from (inaudible ) the xyz's umm… some other of the, the alphabet. Uh… there are, but I rarely use any of those things. They say found in my private practice now uh… where I specialized in very brief therapy by that I mean, I literally rarely see people more than one or two times. Since I work for myself uh… all of my sessions are open ended and never look at the clock. And umm… since I hate making diagnoses, I don't do third party payments or anything like that. Uh… but I should say that that I do have one diagnosis and I use it for everybody if I'm forced to use it. And I would say to maybe to Jennifer, you know, you're temporarily troubled him let's go on from there. And… 

00:36:05
JENNIFER I like that. 

00:36:05
RUBEN BATTINO …thinking umm… in an resonium mode, just listen to those words. Temporarily sets the stage and trouble, I avoid like the plague the word, "problem." You know, what problem is eager to tell me about today and we can spend three weeks with people, you know, telling me their sad stories and in all the rows. So my clients are either troubled or they have concerns well, their things that bother them. And that's what I work with. And all of those are amenable, you know, to, to uh… helping them and helping them quickly. Yes, please, someone has microphone? 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering about umm… she has uh… some religious or spiritual background. What are some ways and I was couple of minutes late, so apologize if you repeat yourself. What are some ways of encouraging people that acts as that when they are avoiding any emotion or spirituality or higher (inaudible ) in all the religion? How you lean in, in that direction? 

00:37:25
RUBEN BATTINO Well, we never get to that part, because uh… if I'm doing this style of guided imagery work which is what demonstrating this afternoon, umm… I always ask them, what do you feel or sense inside is going to help you get through this and help you change. And they tell me what it is and if it's some, something or someone spiritual uh… I, uh… I've had, I've had one woman I worked with who had cancer and she was very religious and uh… so uh… Jesus was the person and we did guided imagery work with her and I worked with her quite a few times. And uh… and Jesus was always part of what we talked about. And then one day she said to me, "Ruben, that that's not enough, I need something else." So we had it and she said, "Well, umm… something that will work for me or uh… native Americans, American-Indians. And they would come and uh… they would ride round and round my cancer and they knew how to track it down and they would go on the warpath and they would get there and read it, read my body of, of the cancer. So whenever I worked with her after that I would ask her, well, what we do today, is it Jesus, is it the Indians or is it both? And she would tell me and we would do that. So they're, they're umm… you have to work within the person's own belief system. And so I find out what that is in and then, and then I do that. Uh… I, I mentioned earlier that I do, I do this very brief, single session therapy where can miss the single session of sitting over here. Uh… and the, the essence I should point out of single session worked as far as I'm concerned is expectation. Everybody who comes to see me knows either before they see me or there that my expectation is, we will resolve everything you've come to see me about this afternoon. And if it takes an hour and a half or two hours and I guess the longest I've worked with one person is three and a half hours straight. If you look at the uh… Erickson literature, the longest he ever worked with a single person, one period of time was 17 hours. Well, I don't know if I could do that, I mean, uh… aside from other things, I'm an old man and hydraulic pressures build up and we would have to do something uh… about that so. 

00:40:35
JENNIFER Break. 

00:40:35
RUBEN BATTINO Okay. Uh… any other comments or yes, please. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN Yes, thank you for your, your presentation, because that's excellent. Uh… and I, I would like to ask about (inaudible ) process, because at one moment, Ruben offered his hand to Jennifer and, and were also genuine to it and you offered, but uh… it was not a response… 

00:41:15
RUBEN BATTINO Yes! 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN …to that and, and, okay. And could you explain uh… why you did this and uh….. 

00:41:20
RUBEN BATTINO Okay, yeah. Thank you. Umm… the umm… you all, you, you have to follow the lead of your client. And all of the earlier you said, you'll be okay to hold hands. 

00:41:35
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:41:35
RUBEN BATTINO But your hand didn't move at all. 

00:41:40
JENNIFER Mm-hmm. 

00:41:40
RUBEN BATTINO So, I just uh… followed and went along with that. Now, uh… one of the things uh… that I've emphasized in some session I, I guess that one of the workshop I did was the importance of touch. Particularly, touching working with people who have life challenging diseases. Uh… at the little panel thing uh… I mentioned this yesterday and Steve liked and said, in the state of Arizona, you can do that kind of thing. Even if you have permission, it's so normal. But, when people have life challenging diseases and, and let me just comment on language again. I used to say life threatening like most people do. Think about the difference between life threatening and life challenging. One is locked in, the other has a potential for opening. When people are, very serious diseases, they all regress to a childhood ego states. And what's the most important thing for someone who's scared like that, holding him. Uh… I've done, I remember a man I worked with a pancreatic cancer and I did this kind of work. And umm… we, we held hands and I'll, I'll explain a little bit, but I do with that. And umm… when I visit him and I visit him in his home, I go in and sit down next to him, he reach out immediately to hold my hand. That was the most, almost the most important thing for him. And what I do with the hand on, can I hold your hand now? 

00:43:30
JENNIFER Yeah. 

00:43:30
RUBEN BATTINO Okay, okay. 

00:43:30
JENNIFER I love to hold hands. 

00:43:35
RUBEN BATTINO There, there are, there, one important thing about this is when I hold hands with you my hand is passive. 

00:43:40
JENNIFER Oh! Like this, like I'm grabbing your hands? 

00:43:45
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah, you can grab my hand, but I'm not going to grab your hand. And yes, it is the easy old way thing. Okay, so I'm, I'm just holding gently. 

00:43:55
JENNIFER Yeah, I'm grabbing it too. 

00:43:55
RUBEN BATTINO Now, I do this because… what I do within the guided imagery session there and that this is what I would have done with you. It is I would say that somehow, somehow magic word from me and through me, you will be getting whatever you need. And then I might go in details that what one of the things that would happen, let's see if you had cancer. Is that from me and through me, since my immune system is working, it doesn't have, my body doesn't have cancer. You, my immune system will be teaching and training yours and making them more effective and more powerful and more efficient so that that comes through this, this contact. And you can do that in many different ways. You will find ways of being more calm or whatever so, thank you. 

00:44:55
JENNIFER And it's not that I didn't want to hold your hand. Umm… when I was on the beach, I was holding Jesus' hand. 

00:45:00
RUBEN BATTINO Oh! I'm not gonna compete. 

00:45:05
JENNIFER And you, I just was, I was just in the moment. 

00:45:05
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, sure. 

00:45:05
JENNIFER And on the beach and I, it's not that I didn't wanna hold your hand. 

00:45:10
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, that that's fine thing. We have another comment back here. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Here's is my question. 

00:45:20
RUBEN BATTINO Oh, okay. There's answer to it. 

00:45:20
JENNIFER Oh, okay, that was your question, all right. 

00:45:25
RUBEN BATTINO Now uh… you know, I, I realize that uh… you know, I had a full hour to, to do this kind of thing. But, if you study the literature and on guided imagery, uh… the uh… the recommended time for a guided imagery session is reaching 15 and 20 minutes. And that's also the attention span the most people have. So uh… doing a guided imagery session for, for, it just, so that's what we did here. I know I did in time but, but it would have been around that time. Now, I also do in a somewhat similar way uh… per a perpetration for people uh… for surgery. And the surgery preparation procedure, if you need to sit in that like, I can give you some more detail on that. 

00:46:25
JENNIFER Okay. 

00:46:25
RUBEN BATTINO Uh… that typically takes about half an hour, because there are many more parts to it. And the essence of doing that is to establish a post hypnotic suggestion about, how the surgery is going to go uh… more comfortably safer, faster and more effectively. Uh… and you'll come through this with less discomfort, uh… and apart of the preparation for surgery procedures, I would find out who your surgeon is and you get permission. And I would write a letter to Jennifer surgeon saying that I have prepared her for this and I've made a half hour tape which you listen to. And it uh… I've told her and prepared her in this particular way and during the surgery would you, the surgeon or someone else in the operating room give these healing messages to Jennifer. And there's a great deal of uh… evidence a lot of it put together by David Cheek who is one of the fabulous uh… the Erickson people on his own style. He's the guy who developed a marvelous city of motor, uh… signaling things. If you haven't read his books or learn to how to do that that's for another time. But uh… he was also an obstetrician gynecologist. Done lot of surgeries is a great deal of evidence, that people under the surgical plane of anesthesia can hear what's going on the operating room. And one thing they, you don't want to hear is, "Oops, okay," in the operating room. But, you want to hear things like and it's okay if I use your name in this? 

00:48:30
JENNIFER Of course. 

00:48:30
RUBEN BATTINO Of course, this goes in it. It's Jennifer, this is going very well now, thank you. So all the statements, there are usually about four or five of them start with the name of the person and always end with thank you. So that you know while you're there that this message is for you and only for you. So this is going very well, thank you. You'll be very comfortable after these procedure is over, you'll recover faster than you expect. So there's a whole bunch of healing statements that are, are part of this. And so I've done this for quite a few people. I remember a friend I did this through was panicked about having, I guess it was a hysterectomy. And umm… and I at the beginning part I said, well, you know, you rehearsals this. It was into the tape and it's your choice as to when you start remembering what was on the tape. Was it in uh… the car, get to the hospital, get to the operating room, uh… get to the room in the hospital, uh… get when they put you on the gurney, take you to the operating, you'll make that choice. And then the whole thing is, set up to be opposed, if not a suggestion so that you wake up when you get home. So it's designed to, to work along those lines. So this umm… I'm, I'm, I'm not supposed to mention this, but it's in one of my books, hold the details, okay. 

00:50:20
JENNIFER Which book? 

00:50:20
RUBEN BATTINO Which book? 

00:50:20
JENNIFER Because I should have brought that up, I'm supposed to have gum surgery and I should have brought that up. I'm terrified to have that done. I just canceled that on the 18th, I should have, I should have uh… 

00:50:30
RUBEN BATTINO He can say. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Can I ask you a question from the audience? 

00:50:35
RUBEN BATTINO Yes. 

00:50:35
JENNIFER Yes. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN What book is it in? 

00:50:35
RUBEN BATTINO Uh… it's the guided imagery book. 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:45
JENNIFER Yeah. Yeah! 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:45
RUBEN BATTINO Uh… I should say one, one other thing umm… about the main, this is my volunteer work. And people find out that I, that I do this and I've had requests from people at other parts of the country, people from overseas that I know or find out about these people, some people I've never met. And uh… they'll, I tell them what information I need. They send it to me, I make the CD and send it to them. And this doesn't I've, I've done so much of this that the making the CD and uh… making copies doesn't take more than an hour. I have all this stuff in my computer and I buy stacks of these things. So, cost is minimal. So… yeah, so this uh… so maybe I'll give you my, my, my, business card and if you are uh… you can e-mail me and I'll be happy to uh… do that. 

00:51:50
JENNIFER Great. 

00:51:50
RUBEN BATTINO Okay. 

00:51:50
JENNIFER I'll be in contact. 

00:51:50
RUBEN BATTINO There's another comment over here. We do that right now. 

00:51:55
JENNIFER Great. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) cost that for example and I would like to ask about uh… this matter, this guiding imagery… 

00:52:15
RUBEN BATTINO Guided imagery. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN …imagery. Hence, for a trouble umm… when I talk to, I heard it and… where imaginary is important tool and I mean, it is Simonton matter for example, what's the difference in similarity… 

00:52:30
RUBEN BATTINO Definitely called Simonton uh… developed this and started this use among colleges, his wife Stephanie is uh… psychologist. And uh… and uh… in the uh… early days they, they did this with groups. And for somex reason, they hit on the image of a shock, uh… swimming through the bloodstream of the patient and the shock, get all the cancer cells still. One day, one of the patients said, I don't want to shock in my bloodstream. So it's always an important part of doing this to find out what image, what uh… entity, what uh… modality, I mean, in the old days they used Pac-Man, I mean, this was 20 years ago would, would do this. But so I have, I, it's important to work within their system and if umm… if I'm doing it generically and I've done workshops on, on this kind of thing, then uh… I have to use a generalization. I'll ask the audience, do you want the healing hands or a healing light or healing touch. And then I'll use that as uh… for the, for the group who work with that particular image. But it, its, its individual has to be really has to be tailored to them just as I did with Jennifer at the beginning uh… watch your wave relaxing. And where do you go for safe haven. It, that turns out to be very important to uh… have somebody in this place where they really feel safe and secure. Okay? 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) and then Holy Spirit. 

00:54:40
RUBEN BATTINO Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN Because you will ask before this… 

00:54:45
RUBEN BATTINO It was relatively simple, I really didn't have to write all that down, but that was okay. 

00:54:50
JENNIFER Nice. 

00:54:50
RUBEN BATTINO So, may I ask just one question before we windup? 

00:54:55
