Facing the Terminal Illness of a Loved One 

00:01:10
Eleanor Thompson 

00:01:10
Husband died of Lou Gehrig's Disease at age 71 

00:01:10
ELEANOR THOMPSON Some of the early symptoms, you, you don't pick up. I mean, they're vague things, that you're… Well, he doesn't feel good. He was tired. Uh… he was having a little trouble swallowing. Somebody picked up a slurred speech which rest of us didn't recognize, uh… when he you begin to feel a weakness in one hand. And then our doctor said "He doesn't seem to be getting better, does he?" And I said "No." He says "We want to send him to a specialist at Lahey Clinic. Uh… he was suspicious of, of neurological degeneration." And I said, "That affects the muscles?" nd he said "Yes." And from someplace, I said you mean like Lou Gehrig's Disease? 

00:02:05
Lisa Pixley 

00:02:05
Daughter died of leukemia at age five 

00:02:05
LISA PIXLEY When you was diagnosed about 10 years ago, umm… it must have been the day before her fourth birthday. She diagnosed with ALO, leukemia, and some form of leukemia, an easy thing to treat and cure. She was at perfect age, had a great chance of survival, and everything was pretty much in her favor. And we treated her for about a year, over a year and a half and we're unsuccessful in getting her cured. 

00:02:40
Paul Tingley 

00:02:40
Father died of stomach cancer at age 56 

00:02:40
PAUL TINGLEY I had a bad relationship with my father, really. So I, I went up and visited him in the fall of 92, and this was a reconnecting point for me umm… trying to say, I know, we've had a lot of conflict in their lives, so a lot of unresolved feelings, but let's just spend a week, be together, see if we can sort of work some of those things out. In the winter of, just kick through in the calendar year 93, he really was not feeling well and he went to the hospital and he was… Uh… they said "You have stomach cancer, Bill" and we're gonna do well. We're gonna open you up and see what the extent of the cancer is. They says, Paul, you know if, it's a long surgery. It means that they're able to go in, and take it all out, if it's a short surgery. No one promised, so we often say we're gonna try to make the best of what you have left in a proper way, it won't be long. So of course, it was shocking to me but I was so glad I reestablished a connection with my father. Uh… he had the surgery and 45 minutes later he gave me a call. So I knew, I said, oh, my gosh, this means that, that they couldn't get it back, right? And he said, yeah.

DARCIE SIMS Well, 23 years ago, we had a son who died of a malignant brain tumor. He was 13 months. And 23 years ago, there wasn't much help available. So we ended up taking care of him at home. And he died surrounded by family, which is what we wanted.

EMOTIONS AND COPING METHODS 

00:04:20
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN An emotion is not a disease that, that feelings, that you may have, that emotions are as natural as eating when you're hungry, drinking when you're thirsty, sleeping when you're tired. 

00:04:30
DARCIE SIMS Oh, I can remember so clearly. The very first thing I felt was absolutely nothing. It literally was if the entire world stopped. It took several months to get a diagnosis. So we were battling an unknown entity for a couple of months and, and went all over the country looking for answers and what was the matter with this child. And the day the physician came out to the waiting room and said, I'm sorry to tell you, your son has a malignant brain tumor. There's nothing I can do, everything stopped. 

00:05:00
LISA PIXLEY A terminal illness is very different from almost anything else. You don't have anything to blame. You don't have a drunk driver to get mad at. You don't, you can't point a finger at a car that hit somebody. You deal with a phantom enemy. 

00:05:20

00:05:20
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN Once you learn that your loved one is dieing or seriously ill, I think, the most important thing you can do initially is get in touch with your own feelings, that you have a right to be fearful, anxious. You may go through different periods of denial. I don't believe it's true. It's a nightmare. When I wake up, I'll find that it didn't happen. So before you can actually begin helping others, you have to start getting in touch with your own feelings. 

00:05:45
DARCIE SIMS It was a chaotic time. And unfortunately my husband, and I, and our daughter who was five at the time, we were all in different parts of the roller coaster at the same time. One of us would be angry, one would be guilty, one would be really depressed. 

00:06:00
ELEANOR THOMPSON I think that there were times I felt like somehow I should be able to stop the deterioration of his body. Because with, it's a Lou Gehrig's disease, uh… he seemed to go down ill in steps. Uh… he would lose the nerve, muscular connection in one area, uh… like, when he'd start dropping things. And so I will know he's losing his hands and I would panic and I would think, oh, can we… Just stop it here, just stop it here for a little while. 

00:06:35
[music] 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Distant sparks flicker and fade on the periphery of the universe. Though I do not feel the loss of each small brilliant flame, I know that somewhere the world has gone dark and its sorrow touches me. I long to like the empty spaces, to fill the black holes left behind. I, too, have loved shooting stars whose brilliance brought me joy and whose fire warmed me. I know the loneliness of watching the flameout or gentle fading of hosts along the Milky Way. It is a feeling that even the desert night, and all its starry wonder, cannot dispel. For the omission of that one small star is greater still, than the glory of a billion more, if that star belongs to you. 

00:07:35
DARCIE SIMS I want to talk for a minute about that the guilt that comes with wishing someone would die. I can remember clearly when our son was so ill, at, in the very last. I went to the Chaplain and I prayed and I prayed for him to die. And I wish I could tell you, I prayed for him to die for his relief, but it was for mine. And I can remember sitting back in the pew horrified. What kind of a mother would pray for a son to die, because she was tired? And it took me years to realize that that's a human mother. I didn't want him to suffer anymore, but I couldn't suffer anymore either. 

00:08:10
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN The most difficult part is facing an uncertain future that your whole life has been hopefully together. And now, you know, that this will abruptly change and to, to face something, the unknown. And the unknown means, you go from we, there will be E to I. You go from the hardest thing for a person to write is widow, after she has been married. So the fact is, is that, it's not only a husband who has died but your life has changed. 

00:08:45
ELEANOR THOMPSON What I saw from the very beginning, I think what bothered me more than actually knowing he was gonna die. Well, I, I thought he had four or five years uh… that he was going to change, and our life together would change. I was called upon to do a lot of things that in my, my own nature. I would never chosen to do. And reach the point where you couldn't leave him alone. I mean, nothing really was gonna happen, but you just didn't want him to be alone. Uh… so you had to be in the house all the time. I mean, you could be there sewing, or reading, or get dinner. But uh… it was, I would love to get able to go out to lunch or something. 

00:09:30
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN Angry thoughts do not make bad people, no matter what your mother and father taught you when you were a child. Angry thoughts make very human people, who are angry because life isn't fair and now you have to live in an unfair world. A husband who is dying, and a future that is uncertain. Grief is nature's way of handling a broken heart. If it's, if it's a child that is dying, it is the death of your future. If it's a parent that is dying, it's the death of your past, if it's the death of the spouse, if it's the death of the president.

CARING FOR YOURSELF 

00:10:20
Rev. Wanda H. Jenkins 

00:10:20
Author, Hard Work:A Guided Journal for the Bereaved 

00:10:20
WANDA H. JENKINS And so it's important that while you partner that person through their dying while you offer them all of the support that you possibly can, that you remember that you're still alive and that you need to take care of yourself. It is hard. The person who's dying can no longer help you to survive. They can't help you to live. They can't do anything for you but take care of themselves and deal with their own issues. 

00:10:45
DARCIE SIMS I don't think it's possible not to get burnt out. This is some one you love passionately, and you're watching your own life filtered through your fingers, not just someone you love but your own life too. So rather than try not to get burned out, let's do something to, to ease it and, and maybe to minimize that. And the first thing I would suggest to people is, you really do take time out for yourself. And if that means you stand in the shower five seconds longer, you do that. You sit down and have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea instead of standing at the counter. It's little things. 

00:11:15
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN We don't believe in martyrdom, because martyrdom helps neither the patient nor the family. When you take care of yourself, you are a better caregiver. So the fact is that you take, you allow the hospice volunteer to come in. Uh… you take, you, you go to a movie during the day. You take time off to, to meditate. When you do this, believe it or not you will be better equipped to handle your beloved husband, friend, who is dying. 

00:11:55
Mary Lou Holland

00:11:55
MARY LOU HOLLAND And some people feel guilty because I'll come in and I'll say, well, I'm here, go to dinner and go to the movies. Oh, I can't. I can't be out enjoying myself on my husband's dying. And you have to tell them that, they first have to take care of themselves and they have to get their rest.

Anticipatory Grief 

00:12:20
Dr. Diane Komp, M.D. 

00:12:20
Professor of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 

00:12:20
Yale University School of Medicine 

00:12:20
DIANE KOMP That term is, of anticipatory grief has been with us uh… for about 25 years now. And what it means is that you have time that you hear that you might die or your loved one may die but it's not today and it's not going to be tomorrow, and that's very precious time. It's much harder for a family who lose a child in an accident uh… or by still birth, or miscarriage, or neonatal death because they never had that time. And it's time to prepare. Uh… it's not our own death, that's the largest and most painful death in our life. It's the little deaths on the way. Its a little death to hear a diagnosis, doesn't take you to the point of dying but it sure feels like it. 

00:13:10
WANDA H. JENKINS When I, when my dad told me on the phone that he had been given six months to a year to live, I can remember going out and walking around Philadelphia just crying, walking down the street. I cried more the week I was going to go visit him than when I got there, I didn't cry after I got there. It's like the whole idea, I had built up such a picture of what he must look like. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN To know or not, I wept. I never had the chance in which to say good-bye. But would it have sat more lightly. Had I known you were to die? I've often pondered late at night about which would hurt the most. Anticipation of your leaving or acceptance of your loss. 

00:14:10
DARCIE SIMS I always thought that an anticipatory grief was a rehearsal. And when we were grieving, the coming of an event, I thought okay if I did this then when the event really happened I'd be over it or I would move through it quickly. And when our son died, even though we had known he was dying, we had planned for his dying. The moment he died, it was a surprise. I can remember inhaling, Chaplin going "Oh, wow." He really died. I'm not sure you can really get close to the fact that someone is going to die. 

00:14:45
[music] 

00:14:50
A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 

00:14:55
ELEANOR THOMPSON (inaudible ) was we got a living to do. So let's do all the things we wanted to do or, and, and haven't done. Uh… splurge a little, which is what I would tell anyone to do early on. Well, well, you still have the, the body and, and the stamina to, to do some of those things. 

00:15:15
DARCIE SIMS We didn't let dying, get in the way of living with him. And we literally lived up until the very last moment. I did not say goodbye. If I'd known that was the last moment, I wouldn't have said goodbye anyway. I wasn't through saying hello. 

00:15:30
LISA PIXLEY For us, it was not Disneyworld necessarily. It's not those big things. I thought once it was and umm… you know, when to make a wish and try to do these big astronomical things before, I knew she would die. I don't know if it's more for me or for her at that point. And then I, she had an attack where she ruptured her spleen. And I was on the phone trying to make arrangements for her to meet Michael Jackson and go to his farm out in California and it never materialized. So while I was on the phone, trying to figure all of this out. She felt like she had a heart attack. She was holding her heart, said, mommy, I, I can't breathe, it's, it hurts, it hurts, make it stop. I put down the phone obviously. And it turned everything around and all the things I thought she wanted, big things, weren't it? You know, it was the little things. I had to bend low to the pillow to hear what she had to say and a soft little voice she would whisper and I told you I love you today and the teardrops of fell on the pillow we're a mixture of hers and of mine. And I wished, I could give her future or at least just a little more time but there are some things I can not determine, over which I have little control. She would be with us only a short time, for heaven was home to her soul. Now I sit here alone with my memories and the sorrow that missing her greens. Yet, somewhere beyond all the sadness, a hope and my broken heart clings, that in that glad day when I see her, I have no doubt of the words that I'll say. In that happy embrace, I will ask her, "have I told you I love you today?" 

00:17:35
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN In my faith there is a, an old rabbi who says, we pent one day before you die. And I said, how can you repent one day before you die? You don't know, they says precisely, you live today. Even if is meaningfully as today, we don't know what tomorrow will bring. 

00:17:55
DARCIE SIMS I think, that's the great gift to being able to be with someone when they're dying, is you do have a few moments, a few days, a few weeks. I did that with my mom. We were able to heal the spaces that inevitably come between daughters and mothers and talk about them. I don't know that we resolved them, but we spoke about them. And she understood how I felt, and I understood how she felt. 

00:18:15
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN I recall vividly one person who said, I haven't spoken to my brother in 20 years, and now I'm dying. And I said, what happened? So I'm gonna tell you something doctor, I forgot. And I said, with your permission, he lived in another state. Would you mind if I called him, told him what had happened. And I don't know what he might like to do. And I was there and both of them were afraid, and they reached out, and they held each other. And this was unfinished businesses. This was a reconciliation, it doesn't always work this way, but sometimes it might. 

00:18:55
PAUL TINGLEY In the summer of 95 he wrote letters. He wrote a letter to my sister. He wrote a letter to me and he says, I'm writing this today, and I don't want you to open them until I'm dead but I opened. His letter after he died said, dear Paul, I just want you to know I've always loved you. I've always counted you as a friend. And it was, it was more than that. I, I can't remember the contents but believe me that's a letter that I keep very dear to me. Here was my father who was dying himself, but he wanted to say what he probably couldn't say face to face. And he knew, I think, he said most of the things that he felt he could say face to face, but he realized that some things you, you can't say because it's just too uncomfortable. So in those instances, he wrote them down. And I think that's a very special gift that he could give that, again would never have happened if I hadn't had the opportunity to know he was dying. 

00:20:00
[music] 

00:20:05
PAUL TINGLEY I've watched his eyes grow tired, liquid full with pain from having to put dreams aside. I recall leathery hands, large and warm as they covered mine. I now realize caring that hid behind a stone face, and hopes that patiently waited as I searched from my own space. I still hurt from times, I couldn't succeed, I beg for more time to show him the respect he needs. I see his eyes, they still hold their light and I want him to wish me a million more good nights. 

00:20:45
[music] 

00:20:50
ELEANOR THOMPSON And that the flipside of all of this for us was that the, the illness knowing that it was terminal uh… gave the whole family a window of opportunity to take care of things. Looking back, I used to think, I would rather have a sudden death, but as painful as this was the, the advantages of a terminal illness uh…. I think far outweigh not having to walk through it, because it gave us a chance to take care of some legal matters. We didn't have a will. And so within a month of being diagnosed Ray, while we were… We got over the shock. Well, we could still think clearly, we did the will. And there was some lonesome property, and we took care of arrangements for the property. 

00:21:35
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN Very often, when a person is dying, we're afraid to prearrange the funeral, because this will precipitate the person's death. It's like, it's a magical kind of thinking. It's… The more you're able to do some of the details when the inevitability comes along, the more you will be able to work through the grief. 

00:21:55
PAUL TINGLEY Because he knew he was dying, we could talk about what Dad… What… How do you want us to do a funeral service? It might seem odd or umm… weird to do that, but it really wasn't. Because he could say, "I don't want a big hubble blue or I would." And we could, we could work it out. He, we talked about the hymns. "Now what are? What are meaningful hymns to you?" 

00:22:25
[music] 

00:22:30
HOW TO BE WITH A DYING PERSON 

00:22:35
DIANE KOMP Most of the children that we work with don't think of themselves as dying, they think of themselves as living, and so do we. Uh… and children are grounded more in today than a distant future. So their concerns are more, "What time is lunch? Will I get another stick today? What time is mom coming?" And things that relate to today. So I think, we can ask them and we can let them show us what their concerns are. 

00:23:05
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN I was interviewing a young person who was dying. And there was a high… middle school and nobody, nobody would, nobody, but he had cancer and nobody came to visit. And I came to the school, and I said, "He is very sick, but he can still talk and some of you might like to go and visit him." And they did visit him. And they didn't just talk about the, "How do you feel about dying?" They talked about girls. They talked about teachers. They talked about the Boston Red Sox, which brought a lot of grief, because they never win. And, and when he did finally come occasionally back to school, and since he had no hair, and he wore a Boston Red Sox cap, they understood. So I think the important part is when you deal with people, is to treat them with what is important to them, not a… not to treat them as something has already occurred. What can we do with what we have? 

00:24:05
WANDA H. JENKIS Because a lot of times people will walk on eggshells with each other, pretending and there is no time for pretence when someone is dying. And when you're facing a major loss in your life, that's the time to be honest and saying, "I'm hurt. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to go through this by myself. I don't want to have to take care of you but I'm going to, but this is not good for me." To be able to say that, it's very freeing. You know, it's very hard when the man you love is dying and has always been strong and there for you. And now you have to take care of him like he's your little baby. That's hard. That's heartbreaking. What to see your beautiful wife do chemotherapy, and to see her lose her hair, to see her lose her breasts, to see her in more pain than she is happy. That's hard. And so it's important for that caregiver to say, "I'm broken and I don't feel strong anymore." 

00:25:10
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN One of the real problems is that people don't talk. They're afraid to even talk about death. I mean, because if you talk about death, there is no hope. The fact is that nobody will come out of this world alive. It's 100% that if you can talk to the individual, you can say, and you can talk honestly. You know, these are some of the feelings that I have. 

00:25:35
LISA PIXLEY We had a bathroom talk once, where she was actually in the bathtub, and just threw out at me. Mom, what happens when you die, and what happened to my grandmother, and where is she, and what's being buried all about. When she asked me, I was shocked. I hadn't yet constructed in my mind what I was going to say because I never imagined that five-year-old asked me something like that so point-blank. And I had to come up with a fast. And it would have helped, if I had in my head, sort of, had an idea together before she asked me. It didn't work out that way. But it came off, right? And in fact, I think I ended up convincing myself of the things that I was telling her about. 

00:26:15
MARY LOU HOLLAND So there is a time in a person's life where they turn away and they're ready to go. And only they know when that time will be. They usually go into a turning away of an interest in things like, one woman used to always have me read "The Dear Abby" column till… She loved that. And one day, I went. And she didn't ask. And she was no longer interested in the things of this world. And sometimes, the friends and relatives feel a little bit rejected. But they must understand that this person cannot leave, if they are still attached to this earth. 

00:26:50
ELEANOR THOMPSON We just said our goodbyes that night. You know, when I put him to bed and sat with him, and held his hand during the night. And I kept telling him, "It's all right, it's all right. It's all right with me. It's time to let go, and it's time to let go." And in, in my heart, it really was. 

00:27:15
DR. DIANE KOMP One of the biggest issues that we face is encouraging parents to allow their children to die, by that I mean, that if a child has any sense that the parents aren't prepared for the loss that if the parents have conflicts in their lives that aren't resolved, that child may hold on at a time that their suffering is being extended, because they're holding on to life for the sake of those who will continue to live. I remember vividly, a family a few years back that had gone for a bone marrow transplantation thinking that this would be the cure for their daughter. And as soon as they got back, the tumor recurred. And it was clear to all of us that there was no medical therapy that would be helpful to her and that death could not be very far away. And yet the parents were insisting on very aggressive treatment, medical treatment in the hospital. And nutrition by vein, everything is if the cure was around the corner if they could only hang on. And this little girl was hanging on. Then one evening, we were with the team visiting in the room, and then we walked that fight, and the mother stepped outside, and she said to me, "How much longer can she live?" It was the first inkling I had that she was able and willing to even admit that the child would die. And I said to her, "You may have to let her know that it's okay with you if she dies." And mom just nodded and went back in the room. The most remarkable thing is that she never discussed it directly with her daughter. But that evening, her daughter started to talk about her dying. And she called, as she wanted to call Grandma and Grandpa, and have them come in, so that she could say goodbye. There was a young doctor that she was very fond of. She had him called at home and he came in. And she said, "Thank you" to him. And he said, "Good night." And she said, "Goodbye." And then she said to her parents, "I want you to pray that I die in my sleep tonight." And she died six o'clock that next morning. 

00:29:45
LISA PIXELY We barged to the clinic and she picked the room she wanted to be in. And she usually was around a lot of children in the clinic. But today, that specific day, she decided she did not want to be with the other kids. And said, "No, mom, I think we need to be in that room, it was a private room." I said, "Okay." She barely made it on the bed. We put a little oxygen by her just for comfort. She still had her pain medicine. And I worked with some the pain management team. And basically she went to sleep. Uhh…she finally let go because I said "It's okay, you can let go now." You don't have to be strong for us. 

00:30:30

00:30:40
AT DEATH'S DOOR 

00:30:40
RABBI DR. EARL A. GROLLMAN What is death teach us? It teaches us, we don't know what the future is gonna be. And so the question is since we don't know what the future is, we have to make as much meaning as possible out of every day that we have. Each day we live a little or we die a little. If today is the ending of yesterday, we have died, and we've done nothing. And people ask the question what is death teach you as a clergy person, as a therapist? It teaches me I don't know what the future would be. I don't, I hear people would before we, when someone dies, they will say "I never told my husband, my wife, my son, my daughter that I love them." I don't the light telling anybody anything anymore. 

00:31:20
LISA PIXELY Will you have a different perspective? Your outlook will be different, meaning of life will be different. Your value and each day will be different. And somehow that that leads your appreciation overall and that's a good thing. It comes from something tragic.

PAUL TINGLEY I do feel that it's unfortunate that I am really, really fortunate to have had the time to experience death. He was 56, he was, he was young but I feel, if he'd lived till 80, I don't even know if I would have had that quality of time, those two years that I spent for my Dads deathbed, it wasn't really a deathbed, it was his bed but we, there was life, there was an awful a lot of life until he stopped breathing.

DARCIE SIMS What I'd like you to know is there are multiple dimensions to hope. First we have a hope for cure and when that's not possible, then I think we move to hope for care and is that begins to fade away from this. I think the other hope is hopeful presence and to be there to take this opportunity to be with your loved one to speak if you can to touch them to communicate to make memories. If you can, that will sustain you. Don't spend all of your time looking at them saying, how much I'm going to miss you, then you're missing the moment that you have. Take the time to say I love you now. You will continue to love them after they have died. But this is a time to be able to communicate. And we see something back. Take the time to be there that's the greatest gift of hope.

UNKNOWN It's okay to go now. I've left my heart on these pages. I've educated this soul enough for it to move on. The pain and losses that broke them strengthened my heart are all behind me. I feel your eyes, your soft hands, and the breeze that is common just for me. There is something beneath me that begins to float me away from your shore. Please keep your voice in my ears. Tell me one last story to pass the time.
