introduction 

00:00:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simons. And I work as a lecturer in counseling of the University of Wales College, Newport. The purpose of this program though is not to turn you into a counselor that’s probably not what you wanted to do. What it will do however, it show you some of the skill that counselor’s use and demonstrate the way in which some of those skills can be used by people in other helping professions, by anybody who wants to use them in fact. It's important to be clear about this, we are not talking about counseling here. We are talking about using some of the skills that counselors use. You might think I’m being a bit picky, but there is a very real difference. The British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy otherwise known as BACP has described counseling as the principled use of relationships to develop self-knowledge, emotional acceptance and growth, and personal resources. 

00:01:10
the principled use of relationships to develop self knowledge, emotional acceptance and growth, and personal resources 

00:01:10
MIKE SIMMONS And it is suggested that the overall aim of counseling is to live more fully and satisfyingly. But BACP also acknowledges that not everyone who uses counseling skills is in fact a counselor. And identifies those skills is being used when there is intentional use of specific interpersonal skills which reflect the values of counseling and when the practitioner’s primary role e.g., nurse, tutor, line manager, social worker, personal officer, helper is enhanced without being changed. 

00:01:50
intentional use of skills reflecting counseling values primary role enhanced, not changed practitioner stays in primary role 

00:01:50
MIKE SIMMONS And when the client perceives the practitioner as acting within their primary, professional or caring role which is not met of being a counselor and that’s what we are interested in here. As far as this program is concerned what we will be looking at is the skills that can be used as part of some other relationship. Nurse, teacher, social worker whatever, if you learn some of the skills we will be talking about your client won’t suddenly think you changed jobs, but they might notice that you are easier to talk to and they might find themselves feeling more able to tell you what they need to tell you. And this is why you might want to learn counseling skills, because they can help you to help them to tell you what they need to tell you, so that you can do your job more effectively. It’s may be worth pointing out that most of these skills are not unique to counselors and you’ve probably being using them for whole of your life. What we will be looking at is the way in which those skills that you’ve already got could be enhanced and use most effectively in your relationship with the people you come into contact with. We will also be asking you to look at yourself and the way in which you present yourself to other people and the way which you form opinions about the people you come into contact with. 

00:03:15
how others see us how we see others listening questions the empathic response 

00:03:20
MIKE SIMMONS The whole package is broken up intersections so you don’t need to watch everything from the beginning to the end unless you want to. It sounds like quite a lot to cover, maybe it's time we made a start, but before we do there are just a couple of points I need to make. Everything you all be seeing is a role play of some sort. It was all recorded with the full awareness of the people concerned that what they were doing was eventually going to end up on this DVD and I’m very grateful to them for their patience and for their help. You might want to look for your remote control before we make a start, because this is a DVD you’ve got the ability to jump from section to section if you want to, but even if you want to watch the whole thing through from beginning to end you’ll still need the remote, because I’ll be asking you to press pause from time to time. I don’t know where yours is, but in our household you can generally find the remote underneath the sofa somewhere, it might be worth looking there before we begin.

00:04:30
how others see us 

00:04:35
MIKE SIMMONS As soon as we start to think about the ways in which others see us it becomes impossible to ignore the fact that we cannot not communicate, we communicate by the way we dress, by our accent and by the things that we choose to surround ourselves with. Everything we do will have any impact to some sort, however small that impact might be. If I dress like this for example, I’m likely to give a different message to the while I give when I’m dressed like this. The message I’m giving right now might well be here is an old hippy dressed up in his interview suit. But if you generally wear a suit to work and the people you interact with don’t. They you will inevitably going to be communicating something to them and that something is almost certainly going to be about the distribution of power. The corollary of this is equally true of cost. If you don’t wear a suit and everybody you come into contact with does then that will also communicate something, you cannot not communicate so you might like to think about what your communicating to people older than you or younger or better half or less well off, you might not always be able to do anything about what you are communicating, but if the people you come into contact with are going to be aware of that communication then it seems sensible that you should be aware of it too. If you are not comfortable with the message you’re giving then you might want to think about a few changes and those changes can go well beyond just thinking about the cloths you wear. Let’s see how that works in practice. No two officers are the same of course and this one seems to be suspiciously tidy but, it is also pretty typical of many. The first thing you might notice is that door. While an open door may well indicate an invitation to people when they are on the outside, once inside the room it may well inhibit them from saying what they want to saying. Different agencies and institutions will have their own policies on this, but there is no doubt that if the door is closed people are more likely to feel they able to talk about what’s on their mind. The close door can also imply that what happens inside the room won’t be disturbed in anyway, so it’s important to make the reality of the situation explicit. If you’ve put a hold on phone calls for example, it’s what saying so, alternatively if you kind of have to answer the phone if it rings, it’s worth saying that too. Again, if someone likely to knock on the door, make it clear. The closed door also suggests something about confidentiality which will again make people feel safe for about talking to you, that’s fine as long as it is safe for them to talk. But if they are assuming a confidentiality that you will not able to offer then they are likely to feel angry and upset at sometime in the future. Tell the people you work with the extent of the confidentiality that surrounds the conversations you have, that way they are not simply going to feel safe, they are going to be safe too. There are other things to consider besides that open door however. You might notice that there is a window directly behind the desk and that will also have implications. If we’re talking about power then there is no doubt that not being able to see someone who can see you and who might be in a position of authority does little to instill confidence in anybody, so what can you do about it. The easiest thing in this situation of course is simply to move the chairs around when someone visits your office. That way the status imposed by the desk is removed and in our example, nobody is disadvantaged by having the light from a window in their eyes. Of course, many of us prefer to sit at a desk where we can face the door, but if you will prepare to forgo this and willing to make some real changes then it’s very easy to make a real impact on the way in which people are able to relate to you. Simply by moving the desk to the window we can create a good deal mores space in the room. And simply by turning our chair to the visitor’s chair there is no longer the issue of power being to noted by someone being seeing sitting on the other side of a desk. In this example in fact, it’s possible to move the chairs right away from the desk, which can only be an advantage. But even the size of the chairs you sit in will have the significance. The person sitting in the higher chair is likely to be seen as being more important than the person sitting in a lower one. Likewise someone sitting in a chair with arms is likely to be seen as being more important than someone sitting in one without. Not everyone meets the people they interact with in an officer of course and much of what has been said has inevitably being a generalization. For some people watching this program, the idea of an office to meet anyone and it would seem like a real luxury, there are many nurses, teachers and youth workers who could hope(ph) for little more than a quiet corner in a crowed room, then again for some people there may be very good reasons for keeping a barrier between themselves and the people they interact with and for some agencies it’s a real triumph to be able to get any chairs at all, let alone worry about whether they got arms or not. So a number of points to bear in mind. 

00:10:45
be aware that you cannot not communicate think about your clothes, language and furniture remember – it’s easier to talk with equals always ensure that you won’t be overheard or disturbed don’t assume things about confidentiality – be explicit 

00:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS You cannot not communicate, you’ll do that through the cloths you wear, the language you use and the way in which you present yourself. Your furniture, the furniture in your office will also make a communication about you. If people feel more equal to the person they are talking to, they will be more happy to talk. If people feel they are not going to be overheard, they are generally going to feel safer. If people know that they are not going to be disturbed while they’re talking to you, they’re also going to feel safer. It’s wise not to make assumptions about confidentiality and not to let the people you talk to do so either. It’s better to make it explicit. So the people you meet with may well see themselves as disadvantaged in relationship to you already, if there are things about you or about the environment in which they find you that emphasizes this then it's unlikely to do much to enhance the relationship between you both. You might find it worth thinking about your own environment and any changes that you might like to make to that. 

00:12:10
how we see others 

00:12:15
MIKE SIMMONS Though it might make us uncomfortable to admit it most of us make snap judgments about the people that we meet. We know the kind of people we like and we know the kind of people we don’t like and generally we recognize which camp a stranger falls into in a very short time. We do this because it helps us to make sense of our world. Life can be confusing enough and if there is anything that we can do to make it simpler then we do it. This means looking for patterns in the unknown and if we recognize a pattern then the unknown becomes known. We may call this process something like learning from experience, but what actually happens is we bring our past learning from previous experiences into the present and impose that learning on to our present experiences. We might also call this process giving a dog a bad name. Have a look at this picture. Most of us are familiar with this and recognize that what we are looking at is not just a wine glass or a pair of faces, but it is in fact a well know piece of optical trickery, but what about this one. This is a much less familiar shape and we struggle for sometime to make sense of it to recognize some kind of pattern. Eventually, we notice that it appears to spell out the word the, at that point we then cease to look for meaning, because we believe we know what it is. We are able to relax from the tension of not knowing. But that shape could equally well be spelling out TH8. Now I don’t know what TH8 means and I guess that you don’t either, but there it is just like the wine glass and faces picture TH8 is equally as present as THE, but we don’t usually find TH8, because we’ve already decided that what it says is THE. As soon as we found the one word we stop looking for the other one. The argument is that we do much the same in every situation that we find ourselves and with every person we meet. Of course, we try to meet every knew event as if it was really new, but old too often we recognize familiar patters and use those patterns as a basis for our judgment. What I’m talking about of course is stereotyping. 

00:15:15
”politicians are…” “football supporters are…” “redheads are…” “estate agents are…” 

00:15:20
MIKE SIMMONS Try this as an experiment what’s the first word you come up with when I say politicians are, football supporters are, redheads are, estate agents are. Now, I want to be clear about this I mean no way suggesting that you actually consciously believe what you’ve just said, no of course you might do, but what I am suggesting is that because you are able to come up with those responses so quickly then there is a likelihood that there is a predisposition for those views to influence you in someway. It will be easier perhaps to say that politicians are slippery, the word that I might come up with, then to say that some are scrupulously honest, some are crooked and some are doing a very difficult job in trying circumstances. Easier, because it means as a certainty there and human beings don’t seem to be very good like holding ambivalences. We’d like something to be one thing or the other. Now, I’m gonna show you a sequence of pictures of people, you probably won’t know them, because they are simply students here who’ve allowed me to take their photograph for this exercise. What I would like you to do is to first find a piece of paper and then using your remote step through the slide show. As you see each picture write down its number and then against the number the feeling that that picture evoked in you. Don’t sense that what you write. Simply write down the feeling that first comes to your mind. Okay, let’s give that a try. 

00:17:25
meeting people 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:18:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right, I wonder how you got on. What’s happened is that you’ve managed to identify feelings about people that you don’t actually know. Those feelings can’t really have told you much about the people on the screen, because you don’t know them but what it has done is told you something about how you respond when confronted with different people. I would like you to jump back now to the beginning of the exercise and look at the pictures again, but this time try to work out where your responses came from, why did you think that that person looked untrustworthy say, or that that one would make a good friend. See if you can make sense of where those responses came from, jump back now. 

00:19:25
Press “Previous Chapter” on your remote 

00:19:30
MIKE SIMMONS I wonder whether you are able to make any sense of this whether you are able to track down with some of those feelings came from. The point of this exercise makes of course is that if simple pictures on a television screen are able to evoke those feelings then it slightly that those same feelings will be evoked when we meet real people, what I’m suggesting is that we prejudge some. This process begins early on in childhood when we form our first concepts of home and family, it’s influence to modify throughout life by the situations and experiences we encounter. It's a constant and ongoing process. It will be great to say that we are not judgmental that we take each person as a unique individual and that we never let our own issues get in the way of seeing someone as they really are. It would be great but also I suspect untrue, it’s untrue for me, it's untrue for anyone I’ve talk to about this and it is probably untrue for you too. If we can acknowledge this part of ourselves rather than deny it then we’ve got a much better chance of meeting people as they really are. If I know the clock is 30 minutes fast, then I know what the time is. Similarly, if I know that my initial response to someone with very short cropped hair is likely to be one of anxiety, then I’ve also got a better chance of treating that person as a real person. Rather than as if they were some skin head who had attacked me in the street 30 years ago, you can monitor this process in yourself at any time on the train, on a bus, in a pub, anyway you see strangers you can check what you think you know about people without actually knowing them. Sometimes you will be right of course, but sometimes you won’t and that’s what so important here, we can make snap judgments about someone and never even know whether we’ve got it right or wrong. How long that it take you to make your mind up about me, for example. 

00:22:00
listening 

00:22:05
JACK SIMMONS The role of listeners has never been fully appreciated. However, it is well known that most people don’t listen, they use the time when someone else is speaking to think of what they going to say next. True distance have always being revered among all cultures and praise(ph) for their rarity value. Odds(ph) and poets (inaudible ), but a good listener is odd to find, at least hard to find twice. 

00:22:35
terry pratchett – “pyramids” 

00:22:40
MIKE SIMMONS All of us feel pretty sure that we know how to listen, after all we would say we have been doing it for all our lives. The reality however is rather different of that. All too often we spend rather more of our time in conversation putting our own complexion on what’s being said then actually listening to what we’re being told. We interrupt we change the subject we finish the other person’s sentence for them, we try to talk their story with one of our own, we jump in with inappropriate questions. We become distracted and lose concentration and sometimes as Terry Pratchett suggests we simply wait for the other person to stop talking, so that we can start. Quite a lot of the time this doesn’t really matter. A conversation is a social event that we can both enjoy, but if we want to find out what’s really concerning the person we are talking to then we have to put those behaviors to one side and to pay attention to what they are actually saying. This largely means ignoring our own concerns and recognizing that this particular conversation is not going to be equally balanced. That this isn’t going to be a time when we can talk about our concerns or what we want to talk about, but it's a time when we simply going to listen. We listen to the words that are being spoken and we listen to the way in which they are being spoken, the tone of voice, the body language. This all sounds like quite a task, but we’ve already discussed some of the issues involved here when we’re looking at the ways in which people see us, how we present ourselves, the way we choose to dress, the chairs we invite our visitors to sit in, the priority we put on this meeting over incoming phone calls or chance interlopers all given indication of our willingness to listen. We can go rather further than this however simply by maintaining an awareness of what helps and hinders communication. When you’ve got five minutes to spare ask someone not to listen to you, while you talk about something that matters. This is a pretty strange request of course and you will need to choose the person you asked rather carefully, but there is a lot that you can learn from this exercise while it's going on there are two things you might want to be particularly aware of what they do and how they feel about what they do. What they do is clearly going to be something you’re want to avoid when you are trying to listen to someone, what you feel is likely to be very disinclined to carry on speaking. The easiest way to show someone that we are not listening to them is simply not to look at them, to look at the clock, to look at our notes, to look out of the window. The interesting thing is that when someone is speaking to us they are varying often not maintaining eye contact. They tend to look up and down as they recall the information they are telling us about. But when they turn back to us to see how we are taking what they’re telling us and then they find that we are not looking at them that almost certainly going to feel disappointed and devalued. Remember, if there is any kind of issue or power involved here then they are unlikely to feel confident enough to say, hey, pay attention to me. They are just going to feel that you’re not interested and may be give up on the idea of explaining their situation to you. If you are able to maintain good eye contact and that doesn’t mean staring at them with a glazed expression, then they are going to feel much more encouraged to go on with their story. I’m talking about listening here, but it’s important to note that we communicate a great deal more information to each other than the simply carried in the words we use. Our body language, our tone of voice, the speed with which we speak, the inflections we use all communicates something about how we are feeling if someone says to you… 

00:27:05
Oh, staying late to do it, yes, yeah no problem at all. I can stay late. 

00:27:15
MIKE SIMMONS You might not be altogether convinced by what they told you. To listen effectively you have to sharpen up your observation skills a little. Here is an exercise that you’ll need the remote control for. I will show you a video clip of someone making a statement and then I want you to press pause and to experiment with repeating what they say as exactly as you possibly can, not just word for word but with the same tone of voice, accent, inflection, facial expression, gestures, the lot. In a sense, you will be trying to imitate them, it’s important to point out that neither counseling skills nor counseling has got anything to do with imitating someone like a parrot, this is simply an exercise to put you in touch with the complexity of the communication made when someone speaks. So watch the clip press pause and try to copy what you’ve seen. When you are happy with what you’ve done press play and I’ll show you the clip again, so that you can see how accurate you were with what you did. 

00:28:30
SUE DANIELS Well, I’ve been waiting for this meeting to start with 10 minutes, I can’t believe that no one has turned up. 

00:28:40
press pause and try to copy what you’ve heard 

00:28:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, let’s see it again. 

00:28:45
SUE DANIELS Well, I’ve been waiting for this meeting to start with 10 minutes, I can’t believe that no one has turned up. 

00:28:55
MIKE SIMMONS I wonder how well you did, the more you pay attention to what someone is saying and the way in which they are saying it the more you’ll become aware of what they’re actually saying, however it’s not just listening that matters, but showing that you’re listening. Good listeners actually tell the people that you’re talking to them that they are listening. They do this by using something called minimal encourages, the nod of the head, the murmured hmms and so on. Of course, all I’ve probably done is give you a name here to something you’ve doing all your life, but minimal encourages are important. You just try talking when someone is not using them. They give a very clear message to the person doing the talking which goes something like I’m content to be simply listening to you and happy for you to carry on talking. Watch these two people talking, you can see that one of them is really listening and they’re showing that they’re dong that by maintaining good eye contact and by giving plenty of minimal encourages. It’s interesting that we don’t need to hear what’s actually being said to know that communication is taking place. One final point, we also show that we are listening by giving the person doing the talking, the space in which to talk. We don’t jump in when there is a pause in their flow. We wait to see if they want to continue, if they don’t then we make sure that our response relates to what they’ve said. Try to spend a little time over the next few days observing how people listen and how they don’t, you can do this at work, you can do it at home. Most social relationships are comparatively equal in nature and they should mean that both take terms at talking while the other listens. What it can all too often mean however is that they both talk while neither listens. See what happens if you try to change your path in that interaction. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
questions 

00:31:15
MIKE SIMMONS We all use questions in every day conversation and they can be very useful in helping us to show an interest and to get the information that we need, the problem is that the wrong kind of question can actually stop us from getting that information. Have a look at this. 

00:31:35
Hello. 

00:31:35
JANE STEPHENSON Hello, its me. 

00:31:40
Hello then. 

00:31:40
JANE STEPHENSON Hi, my car has broken down. 

00:31:40
Yeah. 

00:31:40
JANE STEPHENSON Can you come and pick me up? 

00:31:45
Are you Enamish Bromley(ph)? 

00:31:45
JANE STEPHENSON No. 

00:31:45
Oh, Amid Aaron(ph)? 

00:31:50
JANE STEPHENSON No. 

00:31:50
Oh, Abadin(ph)? 

00:31:55
No. 

00:31:55
Abeshok(ph) 

00:31:55
JANE STEPHENSON No. 

00:32:00
MIKE SIMMONS A stranded motorist is being asked a series of what are called closed questions and they don’t actually allow her to say what she needs to say. And too she gets the opportunity to tell the person she is talking to where she actually is, she is only going to be able to make one response. Closed questions are questions that are generally only answered with yes or no and they can be only useful when the person is asking the question already has most of the information they need and they are just seeing clarification of some sort. The problem is that they’re made always be more information that we are not being given simply because we haven’t asked for it. 

00:32:45
Did head badge(ph) come out when I do this? 

00:32:50
Yeah. 

00:32:55
MIKE SIMMONS An alternative kind of question is the open question, which is one that allows the person who answers it the widest possible range of responses. Had the mechanic asked something like what happens when I do this, he would have got a great more useful information. See if you can see the difference and impact between each of these pairs of questions, the first one in each one is a closed question, the second an open one. 

00:33:25
closed question open question 

00:33:25
FRANK MILLS Did you feel upset when that happened? 

00:33:25
LESLEY SPENCER How did you feel when that happened? 

00:33:30
closed question open question 

00:33:30
FRANK MILLS Do you all well with the rest of the team? 

00:33:35
LESLEY SPENCER How do you get on with the rest of the team? 

00:33:35
closed question open question 

00:33:35
FRANK MILLS Are you saying you’re leaving, because of what happened last (inaudible )? 

00:33:45
LESLEY SPENCER So what’s making you think about leaving? 

00:33:45
MIKE SIMMONS In each case you can see that the open question as it’s name suggests opens things up and allows the person answering the question to respond as fully as they wish to, the closed question however simply helps the questioner to confirm something they already suspected. This is an important point to consider, it's not the closed questions are bad and open ones are good, it's more that they perform different functions. What kind of questions we asked then closed or open should depend on what function we want a particular question to perform. So, if we think we’ve misheard something or misunderstood something that someone has said, we might ask a closed question. 

00:34:35
closed question 

00:34:35
FRANK MILLS Sorry, did you just say that you’ve been working here for six years? 

00:34:40
MIKE SIMMONS But when we want someone to explain things from their own perspective we might ask an open question. 

00:34:45
open question 

00:34:45
LESLEY SPENCER So what do you see is happening after the merger takes place? 

00:34:50
MIKE SIMMONS If we think we might have been misunderstood by the person we are talking to then we might ask a closed one. 

00:35:00
FRANK WILLS I know this is all complicated. Would you like me to go through some of this again? 

00:35:05
MIKE SIMMONS And if you need to clarify something that’s already been said, we might ask an open one. 

00:35:10
AMELIA LYONS You say that your teammates are taking it out on you. Can you say exactly what happens? 

00:35:20
MIKE SIMMONS But if you need to confirm that we’ve understood everything that we’ve been told, we might ask a closed one. 

00:35:30
FRANK WILLS Let’s say if I’ve got this right now, so when you started, you work part-time and you were looking after two teams, but more lately ou’ve been full-time and been in charge of five teams, including the project at Luton that right? 

00:35:50
MIKE SIMMONS Of course some questions break all the rules anyway. The classic counselors, would you like to tell me some more about that? It's a closed question, alright, and could have (inaudible ) yes, no response, but it’s much more likely to allow the person you're talking to, to open up and to tell you what’s on their mind. The important thing to remember is that if you ask a closed question, you’re much less likely to get any new information. You'll just have that which you already knew confirmed. If that's what you want, that’s fine. But if you want new information, ask an open one. Something else to bear in mind is that when you're going to ask a question, it’s important to make sure you ask just the one, multiple questions like this. 

00:36:40
AMELIA LYONS So… so what’s the problem about your job? Is it an issue about not being promoted? Is it just that you’re simply fed up after the renegotiations? Or is it that you want to be moved into a new job? 

00:36:55
MIKE SIMMONS Just leave the person you're talking to feeling confused. We often find ourselves asking questions like this when we think we haven’t been clear enough in our first question. We ask one, then we feel we need to clarify to ask another and sometimes we ask another one on top of that too. The moral of course is to think first and then ask the question. Finally, questions that begin with why need to be treated with some caution. They tend to take people into their heads looking for reasons for their actions in a way, which may not always be helpful. They can also put people on to the defensive, making them feel a bit like a small child. 

00:37:40
Oh, why did you do that? 

00:37:40
closed questions get "yes or no" answers closed questions clarify and confirm open questions get open answers Multiple questions confuse why? questions are best avoided don't ask a question if it's not worth asking 

00:37:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. So to recap, closed questions are most often answered with either yes or no and are best used if we think we haven’t been understand or that we haven’t understood things ourselves or simply to confirm something that’s already been said. Open questions on the other hand allow the person we're talking to, to give us more information and to tell us things from their own perspective. Multiple questions are always best avoided since they only confuse the person we're talking to. It’s also wisest to stay clear of why questions unless we really think the person who we're talking to is likely to have the answer. And finally whatever kind of questions we do ask, we need to be sure that the information we get is going to be worth having. Otherwise don’t ask the question. So much for questions and I hope that’s all clear. Is it? 

00:38:50
empathic responses 

00:39:00
I just had a really terrible today. This really boring... boring meeting this morning. And then on the way home, my car broke down. By the time I got it sorted out, I got this bloke along to fix it and he was absolutely hopeless. It’s just been dreadful, absolutely dreadful. 

00:39:20
What kind of a garage? 

00:39:25
MIKE SIMMONS The reason why we so often ask questions is of course that we're not quite sure what else we should do. By asking a question, we do at least show interest even if it does risk distracting the person we're talking to from what they were trying to tell us. There is a little turn with it though and it’s what counselors call an empathic response. Empathy means really trying to understand what it feels like from the other person’s perspective, not how you would feel if the same thing happened but how they feel. An empathic response is something you say to a person that demonstrates that empathy. So for example if I was to say I’ve got to go back to hospital next week for the results of the tests. I am feeling really worried about it. An empathic response might be something like… 

00:40:30
AMELIA LYONS So you are feeling really anxious about getting these test results. 

00:40:35
MIKE SIMMONS Or something like… 

00:40:35
FRANK WILLS You’re really worried. 

00:40:40
MIKE SIMMONS It’s easy to see how either of those responses would have encouraged me to talk more about my concerns. You also have noticed that they were quite different to each other. The second one simply consisting of three words. Both of them focused on my concern however, worrying about those tests. There is no attempt to pass an opinion to cheer me up to tell me what I should think or do to make a judgment or to deny how I feel about things. This is really important. The way in which we respond to the other person so often fails to acknowledge the reality of their experience. If you can hold back from your own frame of reference, long enough to let the people you work with recognize that you can see things from theirs, you will be doing them a very real service. And you will end up with a much clearer picture of how things seem to be to them. Here is another example. If I was to say something like I've been doing this job for 7 years now and it feels like I'm going nowhere. An empathy response might be 

00:41:55
LESLEY SPENCER So you feel that after 7 years you reached a bit of a full stop as far as your job is concerned. 

00:42:05
MIKE SIMMONS Or it could be. 

00:42:05
AMELIA LYONS The distance that you feel this is a bit of a dead-end job for you. 

00:42:10
MIKE SIMMONS Or again it might just be. 

00:42:15
FRANK WILLS You’ve had enough. 

00:42:15
MIKE SIMMONS Again, you will see that each of the responses simply attempts to acknowledge how it feels for me. An empathic response isn’t about looking on the bright side, it’s not about cheering someone up, it’s not about distracting someone from what they are saying. It’s about acknowledging the reality of what they’ve actually said. This can always be a good deal more difficult for the person who is trying to be empathic because they have to tolerate the other person’s discomfort. But for the person on the receiving end, it can be an enormous relief. Somebody understands what they are saying and lets them say it, they feel heard. You don’t need to be aiming for perfection when you are trying to be empathic by the way. You simply need to say what you think you are being told. No two people will come up with exactly the same empathic response either. Now the time for you to have a try. So you might like to look for that remote control. I ask Sue to come into the studio and make a number of scripted statements, which we filmed. I then ask three counselors to come into the studio and make some empathic responses to the statements as soon as they’ve seen them. You will get to see Sue’s statement first and then each of the counselor’s responses. You might like to press pause after Sue’s statement and try to formulate one of your own first. So let’s try one. 

00:43:55
SUE DANIELS Do you know I really feel as if no one is taking any notice of me here anymore. We have the departmental meetings and you know it's as if I haven’t spoken, no... no one hears me, no one takes any notice of me at all. 

00:44:10
Press pause for your response press play to hear the others. 

00:44:15
LESLEY SPENCER So you feel you almost become sort of invisible at work and in meetings and that you’re also feeling quite cross(ph) about that. 

00:44:30
AMELIA LYONS You sound really upset that almost as if you're invisible in the team and nobody really values you. 

00:44:35
RANK WILLS It sounds like you feel kind of invisible at times. 

00:44:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. How is that? Was your response anything like any of the others? Don’t worry if it wasn’t, but do try to see the point that each of the counselors was making. Strong focus on how things seemed from Sue’s point of view. Now let’s try another one. 

00:45:00
SUE DANIELS I’ve just got a dreadful feeling. I am not up to this job. Umm… I was so pleased when I got the promotion six months ago, but as time goes by, I am just feeling worse and worse. I'm just waiting for someone to find out I’m a failure. 

00:45:20
Press pause for your response press play to hear the others. 

00:45:25
LESLEY SPENCER So you felt (inaudible ) a bit when you got this job six months ago, but since then you started to feel more and more under confident and almost feeling as if you’ve been a bit kind of left to get on with it. 

00:45:40
AMELIA LYONS Although you were initially delighted to got the post, as time is going on, you found joy and self-confidence going down further and further and now you will have a fantasy that somebody is gonna point out that you are really not apt to this job at all. 

00:46:00
FRANK WILLS So you were so excited when you got this, but now there is a real doubts about whether you can actually do it and sometimes it seems like you don’t understand some of the things that are sent to you. 

00:46:10
MIKE SIMMONS And how was that one? What are the things you notice about the responses of the people in the studio are making? Is it they aren’t particularly worthy? They just seem to be looking for the core concern and responding to that. There is something babies and bathwater here. The temptation is to reflect everything so that you don’t miss anything. But if you are giving back the baby and the bathwater, let's do a couple of more and see if you can identify the baby, the core concern and make that the heart of your empathic response. 

00:46:50
SUE DANIELS I am just so angry at the moments. We’ve got three rooms in this agency for seeing clients and we’ve also got a new manager. She wants to take two of those over for herself and other managers. It... it just feels like she is… she is empire(ph) building, I have got half a mind to resign. 

00:47:10
Press pause for your response press play to hear the others. 

00:47:15
LESLEY SPENCER So you feel almost sort of fill up really with anger at the moment and particularly with this new manager and you feel a bit suspicious of her agenda coming into the agency and... and you feel on the points of... of going. 

00:47:35
AMELIA LYONS He’s got to such a point in this job and if you were so angry and so fed up that you're thinking you're giving up, the tin lid sounds like your manager deciding to take one of these rooms instead of being a counseling room. 

00:47:45
FRANK WILLS It seems like you… you feel this is all very unfair at the moment and you’re really angry to the point where you could even just work out. 

00:47:55
MIKE SIMMONS And here’s just one more to try. 

00:48:00
SUE DANIELS I’ve just heard the news I’ve been made redundant and... and I feel devastated. I... I can’t believe. I am so upset because I put so much into my job for a long time. As if I was worse because I been having good feedbacks. So it’s kind of a complete shock. I don’t know what to do at the moment. I just feel completely lost. 

00:48:20
Press pause for your response press play to hear the others. 

00:48:30
LESLEY SPENCER So you've just received the news that you’ve been made redundant and you’re pretty shocked about it at the moment. 

00:48:35
AMELIA LYONS You feel heartily lost in the world now that you’ve been told that you're going to lose your job. It’s a job that you love and everything has been going right. So how could this happen to you. 

00:48:45
FRANK WILLS It sounds like this is a job that you really loved and now suddenly a news of being made redundant kind of that's really made you feel pretty like the wind has been knocked out of your sail, you don’t know what to do next. 

00:49:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. That’s enough for now. Counselors often make a distinction between reflections which are empathic responses, which generally acknowledge of the feelings of someone who is expressing and paraphrases. We focus more on the story. But there is one other kind of response that’s also worth mentioning and that’s the summary. If someone has a lot to say to you, it’s very easy to get lost in an enormous amount of information. The summary is just a way of summing up all the key points as you’ve heard them to make sure that you’ve understood what you’ve been told and that the person you are talking to knows that they’ve been understood. Reflection, paraphrase and summary are simply names given to different kinds of empathic responses. What’s more important of knowing the names is simply trying to be empathic to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. This is something you can practice at any time. if you watch any television at all, particularly the soaps, you will find ample opportunity to practice your empathic responses. Just wait for one of the characters to make a particularly heartfelt statement that maybe just as the credits are beginning to roll. And see what you would say to them as an empathic response. The big advantage of course of doing this is that you can claim that you are studying while you are actually watching EastEnders. So to summarize, if we are able to see what the world feels like to someone we are talking to and if we are able to show them that we’ve got a sense of that world and on top of that if we are able to focus on what’s really important to them then they will feel heard. And if they feel heard, then they're likely to feel able to say more about what’s going on for them and you will get an even greater sense of the things that matter to the people you are relating to. 

00:51:10
I really had a terrible today. I had this really boring, boring meeting this morning and I can’t tell you how tedious it was. Then on the way home, my car broke down. By the time I called somebody to fix it, he came along and he was so useless, I can’t tell you how useless he was. So you know and I’ve just had a failure(ph) today. 

00:51:35
It sounds like you’ve had a bad day. 

00:51:40
Umm… 

00:51:45
examples from practice 

00:51:50
MIKE SIMMONS So far we’ve been looking at the skills in isolation but now it’s the time to see how they work in practice. I asked Amelia and Sue to do two role plays. Both show a worker coming to a manager with a concern, but in one the manager uses counseling skills, while in the other, she doesn’t. The outcome of each session is very different and I’ve selected a number of excepts from each to show you what happened. Have a look at this first. It’s from the bad practice session and see what you make of it. 

00:52:25
bad practice 

00:52:25
AMALIA LYONS So, hi, Sue. I heard you had a problem and you know as your manager, you know you’ve asked me to come down help you sort out. 

00:52:35
SUE DANIELS Yes. 

00:52:35
AMALIA LYONS So you could tell me what’s… what’s bothering you? 

00:52:40
SUE DANIELS Well, I… I recently started here as you know. When I say recent, you know it’s about three months ago. 

00:52:45
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:52:50
SUE DANIELS I haven’t… only for a while I have been off having children and sort of being home with my family, so it’s just been quite a… 

00:52:55
AMELIA LYONS I know what it’s like. 

00:52:55
SUE DANIELS Quite a major events really and… 

00:53:00
AMELIA LYONS How long… how long were you off before? You came back when? 

00:53:05
SUE DANIELS About four years. 

00:53:05
AMELIA LYONS Yes. 

00:53:05
SUE DANIELS And I really forgot… 

00:53:10
MIKE SIMMONS What did you think? Less than a minute to watch but there was a lot going on. Particularly what did you make of that I know what that’s like. It seem to wrong foot Sue a little and certainly didn’t come from her frame of reference and not only being a little over critical here, but I would also have expected a manager to know a little more about someone’s working history than Amelia seems to demonstrate here. Compare the start of that session with the start of the good practice session. It seems very different. 

00:53:40
good practice 

00:53:45
AMELIA LYONS Okay, Sue, you… you telephoned me and you said you wanted to talk about something. So here I am. We’ve got about ten minutes at the moment. But we can come back to this if... if it’s not long enough, okay. Umm… I am just gonna check that my phone is off. 

00:54:00
SUE DANIELS Right. 

00:54:00
AMELIA LYONS Okay, yes it is. That’s good. So please begin when you are ready. 

00:54:10
SUE DANIELS Right, thanks. Umm… I mean this problem might sound quite small to you, but I… I’ve actually been… I also work for a... a long time. I took time out of the work environment time my children will be at home. And I have come back to work for this organization on a part-time basis and I... I was excited about doing this job and joining the workforce again. 

00:54:35
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:54:35
SUE DANIELS And.. and it’s been umm… nothing but a disappointment. And part of me wants to take responsibility for that myself because I know that I am... I am job-sharing with a person. I'm finding it difficult to job-share with. 

00:54:50
AMELIA LYONS Okay. 

00:54:50
MIKE SIMMONS Amelia makes a very clear statement about the time is available, ensures that they won’t be disturbed by any phone calls and then simply let Sue get on with her story. All we hear from Amelia is the odd, murmured minimal encourager. 

00:55:10
SUE DANIELS It’s about personal dynamic. 

00:55:10
AMELIA LYONS Right, okay. 

00:55:10
MIKE SIMMONS This session continues with Amelia making a good empathic summary of what she has been told so far. 

00:55:20
AMELIA LYONS Right, okay. So that’s just, say, if we can clarify a little bit. You haven’t worked for a number of years and you came back to work with us three months ago and as a way in almost you... you joined us a job-share. 

00:55:30
SUE DANIELS Yes. 

00:55:35
AMELIA LYONS To get back into work and you are feeling a bit disappointed at the moment, I wasn’t sure whether the disappointment was around the job share as opposed to the actual job of process not clear yet, but one of the issues that seems to be around is actually your relationship with the person that you’re… you’re job-sharing with and you will… you are exploring how you contribute to that but also how it’s happening between you anyway. 

00:56:00
SUE Yes. 

00:56:00
AMELIA LYONS Is that sort of… 

00:56:05
SUE DANIELS Yes. That's exactly what I feel and... and then I think that you’re absolutely right the... the core of it is… is the relationship. 

00:56:10
AMELIA LYONS Right, right. 

00:56:10
MIKE SIMMONS Sue’s response makes it quite clear that she feels understood and seems to understand her own position a little more clearly as a result. 

00:56:20
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:56:20
SUE DANIELS And I… I want to be able to… so I want to be able to assert myself with her. I mean she is… she has been in the workforce… 

00:56:30
MIKE SIMMONS In the bad practice session, Sue tells much the same story but Amelia’s response this time is simply to attempt to come up with a solution. 

00:56:40
AMELIA LYONS Okay. So if you feel… if… if… if… if one of you was just like redeployed without solve the problem? 

00:56:50
SUE DANIELS Well, no, I... I don’t solve the problem at all because I know what would happen she… 

00:56:55
MIKE SIMMONS ...which hardly surprisingly isn’t any real help. Hardly surprisingly, because she has no idea of what it feels like to Sue not only that but she goes on to show that she really does want to know what it feels like to Sue. She certainly doesn’t seem to want her to resolve anything here. It feels rather than more as if she wants Sue to sit on her feelings. 

00:57:20
SUE DANIELS ...work through what’s happening. What... what I want to do or what I want you help me do. It’s… it’s trying sort of... 

00:57:30
AMELIA LYONS Worked out. 

00:57:30
SUE DANIELS Yeah. Give me some confidence, so I can… or help me get some confidence in this situation. You helped me to(ph) get out of that. 

00:57:40
AMELIA LYONS Right, yeah. I mean I suppose what I meant by that was sometimes you know you can have... I wouldn’t wanna encourage an argument you know in that sense obviously you know we… we get those sometimes in the work... 

00:57:50
SUE DANIELS With, with her you mean? 

00:57:50
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, yeah. I wouldn’t wanna encourage an argument. I mean obviously we… we want things to go smoothly… 

00:57:55
MIKE SIMMONS In the good practice session, Amelia simply helps her worker to tell her story. Her response is a tentative and keep to Sue’s realm of reference. She is showing her concern by the way she is. 

00:58:10
SUE DANIELS I mean she's never taken a break. So... and I have and I suppose she makes it feel quite small. 

00:58:15
AMELIA LYONS Okay. 

00:58:20
SUE DANIELS And, and as soon as I get the feeling that she enjoys doing that. 

00:58:25
AMELIA LYONS Right. So... so in a sense, it almost feels as if you don’t have very much of the voice with this colleague. 

00:58:30
SUE DANIELS Exactly. I'm not feeling flattened... 

00:58:30
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:58:30
SUE DANIELS Most of the time. Umm… 

00:58:35
MIKE SIMMONS Compare that with this clip taken from the bad practice session. 

00:58:40
AMELIA LYONS Yeah, I mean... I’m... I’m concerned about you and I'm your manager and I want you to make sure everything’s gonna be okay for you and to make it work, you know to help you make it work here because I mean I’ve heard good reports by the way about your work. 

00:58:55
MIKE SIMMONS Did that I want to help you make it work here ring(ph) true do you think? In the other session, we just see Amelia working to clarify exactly what the issue is. 

00:59:05
SUE DANIELS It's happening between us. 

00:59:10
AMELIA LYONS Okay. So are... are you saying that you feel small with her all the time or... or just with other people, both, or how... how is that? 

00:59:20
SUE DANIELS I don’t (inaudible ) on my own I... I don’t feel it’s small. 

00:59:25
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:59:25
SUE DANIELS I am able to assert myself as I said, I want to do… 

00:59:30
MIKE SIMMONS The bad practice session is now going from bad to worse. Sue has expressed her dissatisfaction with the session and Amelia has ignored this entirely and simply denying the reality of what Sue is feeling. 

00:59:40
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

00:59:40
SUE DANIELS And what I expected from you is some help in... in sorting it out. What I actually feel is… is it's more distressed than I was and then when I... 

00:59:50
AMELIA LYONS ...came in. 

00:59:50
SUE DANIELS …to sat down, yeah. 

00:59:55
AMELIA LYONS Well, what I suppose what I wouldn’t want you to think that it was something to get too sort of steamed up about, I just wanted us to… to get to a point where we could look at the issue and see if we can get… 

01:00:15
SUE DANIELS ...that I'm gonna explode actually. I mean don’t get too steamed up about it. It has been affecting me for three months. 

01:00:20
MIKE SIMMONS That I wouldn’t want you to think it was something to get too steamed up about was inevitably going to leave Sue feeling low and it did. You might say it was exactly the opposite of an empathic response. Sue was steamed up and it was ignored. Compare that with this and look out for that all right so it’s changing. 

01:00:40
SUE DANIELS It’s difficult. 

01:00:40
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:00:45
SUE DANIELS But I do it and I make a very conscious effort to do it and it’s getting better. 

01:00:50
AMELIA LYONS Right. So it’s changing. 

01:00:50
SUE DANIELS It is, yes because... 

01:00:50
MIKE SIMMONS It was important for Sue that it should be recognized. Meanwhile in the other session, Sue is getting more and more dissatisfied with what’s going on and at least to some extent Amelia acknowledges that. She wants to start again and it seems possible that they could finally get somewhere. 

01:01:15
AMELIA LYONS So… so… so I am sorry if you feel that that seems that you got more angry in a way and... and I know that coming back to work you… you know it’s important. So… so we can just look again at... at what’s going on for you and how… how we want to… to sort of move… move through this. 

01:01:40
SUE DANIELS Okay. Well, yeah, I would want something... 

01:01:40
AMELIA LYONS Right, right. 

01:01:45
SUE DANIELS Like that makes a fresh start maybe because what’s happened so far hasn’t been helpful. So… 

01:01:50
MIKE SIMMONS Maybe they could have started again. Maybe everything could have been alright. But now we see what happens if you don’t avoid unnecessary disturbances. 

01:02:00
SUE DANIELS ...I mean to say that you value my work and I really want to stay in the job? 

01:02:05
AMELIA LYONS Hang one minute. Hello. This is Lyons. I'm a bit tired up. Can I… can I get back to you? And... yeah, yeah, it’s… it’s in the top right-hand shelf of the cupboard and it’s in the green container. No, it's confidential alright. And when you finish with it, can you put it back in that please and lock the cupboard? 

01:02:35
MIKE SIMMONS She says I am a bit tired up, can I get back to you, which would have been appropriate, but she then continues with the call. It’s easy to see the impact this is having on Sue. And of course the good session is still going well. Look how for that, can you say more about that. It encourages Sue to explore further. 

01:02:55
SUE DANIELS Because I think I am making changes around that and in my mind I am just thinking about how… how do I that and could I do that in a group. 

01:03:05
AMELIA LYONS Umm… umm… umm… can you say more about that? 

01:03:10
SUE DANIELS Umm… 

01:03:15
AMELIA LYONS You notice yourself handling that? 

01:03:15
SUE DANIELS I think it’s just… it’s… it’s… it’s sort of… it’s almost like putt an (inaudible )I mean it might, might sense silly, but it’s... it's preparing myself instead of going in very vulnerable and (inaudible ). 

01:03:26
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:03:26
SUE DANIELS When I’m on my own with her, I've started sort of saying right, what's she likely to do and what are you going to say. 

01:03:35
AMELIA LYONS Right. 

01:03:35
Umm… why, for some reason when I'm going to the big group I feel much more exposed and I’ve got that armor or that protective sort of feeling. I don’t know but I think I could start planning umm… about what she is going to say to me and instead of just planning how I am going to get her back or. or get a one up umm... probably manage it in a different way and make some plans about protecting myself. 

01:04:00
MIKE SIMMONS This pretty much speaks for itself. Things seem to have got just about as bad as they can. 

01:04:05
AMELIA LYONS But I do... I do want to keep on talking about everything and I do want to make sure that everybody is happy I certainly say as in and all our interest for everybody to be you know happy at work and it’s not good if they are not. 

01:04:20
SUE DANIELS Yes I'm not, she is saying I want to be happy. You obviously haven’t heard because I don’t want to be happy. I want to be able to manage the situation in an (inaudible ) why I not be happy, I’m gonna makes me feel like a some sort of charge and wants you know her to skip around the (inaudible ) I just want to learn how to be, I dealt in the situation and manage this work relationship in a way that’s beneficial for me and the organization, because I’ve been (inaudible ) about ten minutes ago, I did feel some loyalty towards the organization but you know I am… I’m feeling extremely angry now, not heard and it’s quite not easy, just... just walk away (inaudible ) 

01:05:00
MIKE SIMMONS Meanwhile, the other session leads to a moment of real insight for Sue. 

01:05:05
SUE DANIELS That’s how she really… I mean I feel like I am telling you this story and that you must think I'm really stupid. 

01:05:10
AMELIA LYONS Right, because you keep… you do keep saying much about yourself, I know it’s… this might sound silly. 

01:05:15
SUE DANIELS Yes. 

01:05:15
AMELIA LYONS This might sound stupid and almost it's a kind of a way putting yourself down really. Are you aware that you… you’re talking about somebody else doing it and also I am noticing you do that to you? 

01:05:30
To myself and maybe that’s… 

01:05:35
end of the sessions 

01:05:40
MIKE SIMMONS Now these were both just role plays of course, but they weren’t scripted. Sue and Amelia started off with a scenario that looked as if it could be useful and then just went with it. What we saw was the difference made to the outcome of a session when counseling skills were being effectively employed. And that pretty much brings us to the end of this program. We’ve covered a lot and if you are able to put just some of what we’ve looked at into practice, it’s likely to make a real change in the way in which you relate to other people and it’s certainly likely to help you to be more effective in your work. We’ve been looking at the ways in which you can help people to tell you what they need to tell you. This means that you have to hold back from talking about you and your world and you’ve had to forget about your agenda at least temporarily and to try to understand how things feel like from someone else’s point of view. This is going to be valuable for both of you, but don’t forget that you have needs too, and though in your work row with others it may not be appropriate to avoid some, you also need people to talk to. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you always have to be the listener. There may be times when interrupting, changing the subject, and talking about things from your own point of view might be just what you need to do.
