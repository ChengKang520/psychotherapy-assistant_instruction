I'M RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, I'm Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and welcome to the series the six biggest challenges that therapists face. One of those challengesfor many therapists is the case that seems to present itself as fairly straight forward, you're gonna establish some conditions of safety in your office, you're gonna form a bond with your client, you'll talk through the issues, that the client has brought into therapy, and in fairly short order, people are gonna feel more in charge of their life, and move on. Um, and, uh, it, there'll be very, a relationship uncomplicated and therapy will be quick. Sometimes it doesn't work out that way, even though it seems, as you may have noticed in your practices. Even though you may think at first that's where it's going, and our guest today is gonna be talking with us about cases like that and the challenge that they represent. So, without further ado, let me introduce, uh, Janina Fisher. Hi Janina. 

00:01:15
JANINA FISHER Hello! 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON Janina specializes in, uh, working with trauma. And working in a number of different modalities(ph) Uh, semadic(ph) modalities, her approach is very rounded in the understanding of the brain, and the role that the right brain plays in the therapeutic alliance. Has done, uh, she's integrated a number of, um, models in her operating method. So today, um, Janina, let's talk about the, this sort of case and you, you'll tell me how this, uh, how you conceive of it. Where someone comes in, they don't appear to have some horrible history of trauma. They're coming in, they're resourceful people, they seem to have a sense of clear direction and what they want out of their therapy. You begin to see them, and at some point, several sessions into the therapy, uh, things aren't moving, nothing's happening, and you have the sense, like, is there something else that I've missed early on. Do you have that, even with your level of experience and all your background in trauma? Does that kind of thing happen in your practice? 

00:02:25
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. That's, uh, as you know, years of experience do not guarantee easy clients. 

00:02:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:02:35
JANINA FISHER It, uh, uh, it there doesn't seem to be any relationship, uh, at all. And, you know, as you were talking, I was thinking, these are our often, very high functioning individuals. 

00:02:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:02:50
JANINA FISHER And what we don't see at first are the cracks in the foundation. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:02:55
JANINA FISHER It's like a, it's like a a beautiful house, with, uh, very, very deep cracks in the foundation. And often, I find, that I don't quite realize what I've gotten in to. 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:03:15
JANINA FISHER Until, uh, I, you know the quicksand starts to pull me down, and, uh, and I start to feel stuck, or I start to feel, uh, confused, what are we doing here? I thought we were doing this, and, uh, and now what we're doing ten things. And every week it's a different issue. Uh, I think that's one of the ways that we see the, the cracks in the foundation. 

00:03:45
RICH SIMON So, so when you say, every week it's a different issue, and maybe the, the way that, the best way to get into this, and then we'll talk more about the... 

00:03:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:03:55
RICH SIMON ...maybe we can move from a particular example of, of your dealing with a case like this, then we can, uh, pull back from that and... 

00:04:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:04:05
RICH SIMON ...how you think about it and, and, uh, helped people to think through. Perhaps some methods and ways of approaching cases like what you're gonna describe. Does a particular case come to mind that matches this description? 

00:04:20
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:04:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:20
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. And, uh, and it also he's a very good illustration of what I think is at the heart of these, uh, foundational cracks, uh, which is failures of attachment. 

00:04:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:35
JANINA FISHER A very early attachment. Uh, so there's nothing to build on. Uh... 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:45
JANINA FISHER So, here, here's a, here's an ideal client. I was actually very, very happy to get this phone call. Uh, probably a year, a little more than a year ago. Uh, because this is a gentleman, he is a, uh, doctoral level, helping professional. Um, very, very richly resourced in all the ways that, uh, make clients gratifying and, uh, where you feel like you're collaborating with them, rather than pulling them along. 

00:05:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:20
JANINA FISHER Um, he's, uh, taken many trainings himself, gone on many retreats, uh, he's a meditator, he's a believer in personal growth. And the call said, uh, "even though, I've done all of these things, I'm still afraid to get on an airplane". And, uh, and I thought, "wonderful, this will be easy, this will be no problem at all". So here we are a year later, and, and, and things are probably, in some ways, more stuck than they were then. Uh, or at least, maybe we're discovering the stuckness. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON So we just get it. So, you're thinking, okay, here's, uh, several sessions, here's a phobia... 

00:06:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON I have some methods to help... 

00:06:20
JANINA FISHER Four or five sessions. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:25
JANINA FISHER Right. Right. 

00:06:25
RICH SIMON Alright. 

00:06:25
JANINA FISHER And, uh, and I remember the way that I work with fear of flying is to ask the client to imagine, uh, getting onto the airplane. So, so it's really a visualization of, you know, when does the panic escalate? Does it escalate the day before when you're packing the suitcase? When you're walking up the gang plank or down the, uh, down the chute? Uh, and he said, "the panic escalates at the moment I'm walking to the plane and I'm looking at all those seats stretching back and I have the thought, they're all gonna turn around and they're going to think I'm defective. And, they are going to humiliate me". 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:07:20
JANINA FISHER And this was a fear of flying, that might, should have been a clue about the cracks in the foundation. Because it's, it's not a fear of flying I've ever encountered before. 

00:07:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:35
JANINA FISHER Just think, when was the last time you went on an airplane and you worried that everyone on the plane was gonna turn around on you, and look at you and say, "oh, he, he's defective"? 

00:07:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:45
JANINA FISHER Um, so, it felt like a very, very, an issue with very deep roots. 

00:07:55
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:07:55
JANINA FISHER Right? This was not the usual fear of loss of control. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:05
JANINA FISHER So, uh, when did we discover the stuckness, uh, I would say probably, uh, by the fourth or fifth session. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:15
JANINA FISHER Uh, I began to see that, and I'm sure other therapists have had this experience and I'm sure you've had this experience, I began to see that there was actually a real attachment to this fear, because it was preventing him from getting on a plane. And it wasn't giving up easily. So, as we tried to... 

00:08:45
RICH SIMON Say a little bit more about this... 

00:08:45
JANINA FISHER Sure. 

00:08:45
RICH SIMON When you say there was an attachment to this fear, so, so what is it that, so what, after four or five sessions the experience that you had that really "oh let me take a look at this in a somewhat different light", was? 

00:09:00
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. And, so, you can imagine, I'm sure, many people would have worked this way, so we begin, I began by having him notice that fear as, as just a belief. And this, as you know, is sensory motor pshychotherapy. Where we notice the thought is just a thought, the body sensations is just body sensations, the feelings as just feelings, mindfulness based way of working... 

00:09:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:30
JANINA FISHER ...and, so, uh, when I asked him to notice that thought, "they're all gonna turn around, and find me defective", uh, he kept saying, "it's not a thought, it's true". And, again, I'm sure you have had those struggles, it's like when the client says, "no, I am worthless". That's not just a feeling. "I am worthless and you have to understand that." So, uh, and even though as a meditator he was very skilled at noticing "Oh, when I have that thought, I start to feel sick to my stomach and I want to run off the plane". He didn't have the ability that I had expected to notice those responses and then be able to separate from them... 

00:10:30
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:10:30
JANINA FISHER ...so that he could see them as just responses. Uh, I asked him a very typical question that I ask, that we ask in sensory motor, is there an image or memory that goes with that belief and that sick feeling in your stomach? And, uh, and the image that came up was of his being afraid to go somewhere by himself. And his mother getting very irritated and sort of pushing him away. And saying, "go, go, you're being silly, uh, you're fine". And while internally he's panicking. 

00:11:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:15
JANINA FISHER And, as you know, many, many of us, when we get in touch with that childhood memory, have a moment of insight and kind of separation from the symptom and we say "Oh, well of course! I have this fear of people will see me as defective". 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:40
JANINA FISHER "Because there's my own mother in this memory and that's how she's making me feel". But for him, it seemed as if the memory just, uh, reinforced this sense that he better not get on a plane, because everybody on the plane would be just like his mother. 

00:11:55
RICH SIMON I, so this is what you said earlier about the attachment to the, to the feeling to the problem instead. 

00:12:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:12:05
RICH SIMON There's no room, there's no sense of that was then, this is now. This is just... 

00:12:10
JANINA FISHER That's right. 

00:12:10
RICH SIMON ...one thing that's locked in. I get you, okay. 

00:12:15
JANINA FISHER Right, right. Right. So, and, again, I think this is something we all, as therapists, encounter, is, is when... 

00:12:25
RICH SIMON Feel ourselves! 

00:12:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah, feel ourselves, for that matter! Where we're afraid to give up the symptom. Right? Right? 

00:12:30
RICH SIMON I can't even imagine. If, or... 

00:12:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Maybe it's a fear, but you can't imagine because it's you! 

00:12:35
JANINA FISHER Absolutely! 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON There's no other, there's not other identity. You are the problem, you are the fear, all those things. 

00:12:45
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON Which it would, what you meant... 

00:12:45
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:12:45
RICH SIMON ...by 

00:12:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah, and that is important. He is us and vice versa. 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:55
JANINA FISHER Um, yeah, yeah. And, as you know, uh, because you and I have had, uh, many conversations about, uh, these ways of working, I thought to myself, "Okay, when, when someone says, 'no, no, it's true', when someone says, um, expect the whole world to be like his mother or his father, how old is that person"? 

00:13:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:30
JANINA FISHER Right? I mean, just think babies who call all men 'Dadda' and all women 'Momma'. Right? So, I really started to sense, this is a very young part of him. 

00:13:45
RICH SIMON Mm. Mm-hmm. 

00:13:45
JANINA FISHER That goes onto the airplane and looks at all those seats and says, 'oh my gosh, they're all going to judge me and reject me'. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:00
JANINA FISHER Uh, so that's, and as you know, that's where I go when people are stuck. When, when I encounter that stuckness. Whether it's visit three, visit 13 visit 30. Um, when I do a consultation to a client, or a client and therapist, uh, in which the therapy is bogged down, the, I assume these days, when somebody is stuck, we're talking about very, very young parts of the self that are, uh, intruding into the present time and experience. 

00:14:45
RICH SIMON And what, and the dif-, and the, what you were saying earlier, when someone is presenting as so resourceful and quite together, it can be hard to, uh, to pick up the cues early on. That, that young self. 

00:15:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON Actually being triggered... 

00:15:00
JANINA FISHER That's right. 

00:15:00
RICH SIMON ...in whatever part of the nervous system that got wired in at a very early age is somehow presenting, as, as, in this adult form, in this, and even though the person seems in all, in most ways, quite resourceful. 

00:15:15
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. And I think that when we have the experience of empathically failing the client, I think most of those experiences are moments when we're responding to this very intelligent, well functioning adult, uh, with good frontal cortex, and actually we're speaking to a child. And so our, our facial expressions are off, our tone is off... 

00:15:50
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:15:50
JANINA FISHER ...our words are directed toward a grown up brain... 

00:15:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:15:55
JANINA FISHER ...not the child's brain, and then the client says, "how could you have said that? I feel so wounded". And we think, "well, I said something very reasonable". 

00:16:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:16:05
JANINA FISHER But it wasn't reasonable for that child part. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:16:10
JANINA FISHER Right 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON So ho-, so in the particulars of this case, so as you recognize this and as you realize, as it dawned on you, that this, this fellow there was an unintegrated part of him that didn't fit with this other part that was, uh, very knowledgable, versed in the language of the field and so on. Ho-, it, how did you begin to shift in what, how you said what you said, and how you presented yourself as in the relationship with him? 

00:16:45
JANINA FISHER Yes. Uh, what I tend to do these days and I find that most clients are really comfortable with it, it some how resonates, I just move right in to talking the language of child in parts. And I think, what I said to him, was, something like, "wow, this is a really young place". 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:17:10
JANINA FISHER Right? This feels like a little kid, um, who looks at all the people in his world and all he sees us, uh, are, people who are going to judge him and push him away and make him feel ashamed of himself. And, uh, and, it was actually very sweet, because the client, who'd been in a sort of depressed posture, um, lit up, and said, Yes, that's exactly what he expects. Uh, now, of course, it wasn't smooth sailing. I would love to tell a story about he then had this miraculous transformation and embraced the child part, uh, um, but, uh... 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON That was just the beginning of... 

00:18:10
JANINA FISHER Yes, that was the beginning 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON ...the work, just the beginning of the work. 

00:18:15
JANINA FISHER Yes. And, uh, and at some point he said, he said, "you know, actually, 20 years ago I used to do inner-child work, I, I'm remembering that now". 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:18:25
JANINA FISHER Uh, and it didn't stick, I think, because the, at the next session, we had this lovely session in which he recognized and felt compassion for that little boy. The very next session, he returns and there's a differnt part of him that has arrived and I can tell because, uh, the very first thing he says is something like, "well, I hope we're not going to waste our time talking about parts again. Because I have to get on a plane". And I really don't have time for all this gobbledigook about parts". 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:15
JANINA FISHER And I still do that. I call those parts gate-keeper parts. They're parts that sort of defend and preden-, protect the dignity of the adult self. Right, I'm a grown up here, I have a job to do, I hired you to get me on a plane I didn't hire you to be talking about wounded children. And, uh, and I think all of us are familiar with that back and forth between the kind of opening and getting in touch with some vulnerability being able to have compassion for that vulnerability and, uh, then the defenses coming up. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:00
JANINA FISHER I find it much less frustrating, and I get less stuck if I say, a-ha, this is a different part. 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:10
JANINA FISHER Do you know what I mean? Cause I think it's very frustrating... 

00:20:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:20:15
JANINA FISHER ...when, as therapists we're thinking we're gonna pick up where we left off. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON That's right. I, that makes a lot of sense, yeah. So, it, you punctuate it for yourself, so you don't feel, oh that was a waste of a session, or why are we back to that. 

00:20:30
JANINA FISHER Well, he's being resistant, I think the classic language would be, a-ha, there's resistence. 

00:20:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:20:35
JANINA FISHER And it isn't to say that there isn't, but if I say, a-ha, there is a part of this man, um, that is defending against vulnerability and putting me on notice, that I some how have to get him on a plane without going near the vulnerability. 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:21:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON And a very functional part of him, so it's some, a part to be dismissed. This, this part is, you know clearly worked very well for him, in his life and got him to where he is and... 

00:21:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON ...we're moving into dangerous territory. But I could, yeah, makes a lot of sense that, uh... 

00:21:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:21:15
RICH SIMON ...just, uh, recognize that we're in a different, dealing with a different aspect of him right now. 

00:21:20
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Is, uh, is more useful for you as a therapist. 

00:21:25
JANINA FISHER Yes, yes, absolutely. And, uh, and when I can language that, you know when I can say to him, a-ha, so there's a part of you that's afraid to get on the plane and another part that doesn't want to talk about the part that's afraid to get on the plane. 

00:21:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:21:45
JANINA FISHER Then I don't feel stuck anymore. 

00:21:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:21:50
JANINA FISHER Right? I'm not stuck by the client's stuckness. 

00:21:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:21:55
JANINA FISHER Because all I have to do is name the relationships, uh, between these parts that I'm noticing. 

00:22:05
RICH SIMON And what does he, when you say that to him, in this case, what happened? What did he say? 

00:22:10
JANINA FISHER Well, there've been various combinations and permeatations(ph) of this conversation... 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Okay, alright. 

00:22:15
JANINA FISHER ...as you can imagine. Sometimes he says, "Oh, yeah, you're right", and we've come to call that, that voice that says, uh, you know, what's all this clap-trap about parts, uh, we've come to call that the skeptical part. 

00:22:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:22:35
JANINA FISHER And so, when he's in his, what I call his wise-mind self... 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:40
JANINA FISHER ...um, and you'll recognize the connection there, too, in internal family systems, um, when he's in his wise-mind self, he's aware that the skeptical part is really rejecting this child part. Uh, the way his mother rejected him. 

00:23:00
RICH SIMON Mm, okay. 

00:23:00
JANINA FISHER Right, cause the, really the skeptical part is saying, "well, just get on with it". Right? "Just get on the plane and be a grown up". Which is really what his mother was saying. At the age of five and six, she was already saying, "just go do it and be a grown up about it". 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:23:20
JANINA FISHER Right. And now this is playing out internally. And, I, I, I'm sure you're very familiar, uh, as a family therapist with getting inducted into the system. 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:35
JANINA FISHER And so I think of this as also a way for me not to get inducted into the client's system as an individual. Because as long as I'm outside the system and I'm saying, "Oh, here's the skeptical part, uh, he's obviously worried that we're going too deep and, uh, getting close to the, uh, to the five year old part". 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
JANINA FISHER So sometimes the skeptical part comes to therapy, as happened yesterday, sometimes the wise-mind. Ah! But I find that there is a slowly, if I can help the wise-mind in people access compassion for these young places. Even though that gets challenged by the skeptical parts, the, uh, angry parts, there is a slow, slow progress toward more and more self acceptance and therefore more comfort in just being in the one's own skin. 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON Now how, so how do you encourage that? And, and, I should say that you, there's a lovely example of this, in our July issue of the Network, where Janina's written a case where she describes how she does that, that processing in a particular case. For in terms of what you're talking about now, so that's, it's one thing to have that idea, but you're really, words go only so far and then clearly when you get into this kind of territory and you're dealing with, uh, young parts of us the language is not that important to us, at these early ages, and then there's part of the self that language is very important as we release these developmentally more advanced parts, or older parts at least. So, uh, talk to a little bit, how do you encourage that, uh, connection of compassion between the wise-mind, or as people like to say, the self... 

00:25:50
JANINA FISHER Uh-huh. 

00:25:50
RICH SIMON ...and this, these parts that are exiled, these, these parts that are quite vulnerable. 

00:25:55
JANINA FISHER I think they're, the wonderful thing is there are many, many ways to do it. And that allows us to work with clients who are better visually, so I have some, I have some clients who do well, if I say, "can you see this little boy, standing right in front of you, this minute, can you see him", or, "imagine that he's standing in front of you right this minute, what's the expression on his face? What's his expression telling you?" 

00:26:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:26:35
JANINA FISHER Okay? "What happens in you when you see that face looking both, um, uh, uh, sort of, what, both, uh, needy and frightened? Um, what happens in you? Do you close up, do you open to him?" So sometimes the visualization right here, right now, can you see him? Um, sometimes especially with people, and this happens more with men, but also with many women clients, there's a distaste for nurturing the young selves. And so, if I have somebody who says, "you want me to talk nice to that kid who's an embarrassment to me?" 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:30
JANINA FISHER Um, uh, then I might say well, "where do you feel his shame and fear in your body?" And typically people will say, "I feel it in my chest, I feel it in my stomach", uh, and then I say, "would you be willing to humor me for a moment, and notice what happens if you just put your hand right where you feel his shame and fear". 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:28:00
JANINA FISHER And so just notice that physical experience. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:28:10
JANINA FISHER Feels good, doesn't it? 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, it's nice. 

00:28:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, that's great, you don't feel alone. 

00:28:15
JANINA FISHER Right. Exactly. Exactly. And then, sometimes, uh, I can go one step further, sometimes I can't, I have to, uh, pace it, very carefully, uh, especially with young parts that feel a painful loneliness and abandonment, uh, I can say, "would you be willing, um, to say something to this place that feel so lonely and sad?" And I might ask, "would you be willing to just say the words 'I'm here'." 

00:28:50
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:28:55
JANINA FISHER I'm here. 

00:28:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Ah, that's lovely. 

00:29:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. And, and... 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Very simple, very, very direct. 

00:29:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah, very simple. And, you know, even you and I just demonstrating I'm feeling more calm and warmth, uh, yeah, yeah. And, you know, in sensory motor psychotherapy where these interventions, uh, come from, we believe that the therapist always needs to do it with the client, so while the client is doing this, I'm doing this. 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Oh, I wasn't aware of that. 

00:29:35
JANINA FISHER Yes. And I, and I have a client who, uh, who always says to me, "I like it so much when make the movements with me because it's like looking at myself in a mirror". And it deepens the connection to myself. 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. And it, it, it, and you're here, so I can... 

00:30:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:30:00
RICH SIMON ...I can just feel that as doing it alongside you now. 

00:30:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON We're in the same boat, it's the human, on some level, complicated the condition... 

00:30:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON ...this very basic level, I can, I see you, yeah. 

00:30:10
JANINA FISHER Right. Yes, exactly. And another one that I love for people who are, um, these are really, I think individuals who are phobic of their vulnerability and therefore of their vulnerable parts. Uh, if this is too much, I say, um, "would you be willing to just put an arm around this part. Take this part under your wing". 

00:30:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. I see 

00:30:40
JANINA FISHER Like, yeah. Kind of, kind of like, you know, the pat-pat. Which is less threatening... 

00:30:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:30:50
JANINA FISHER ...in, right? 

00:30:50
RICH SIMON More of a guy thing, you know, like okay. 

00:30:50
JANINA FISHER So I find even the roughest and toughest individual is willing to take a younger, more vulnerable something, under his or her wing. 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:31:05
JANINA FISHER And, uh, and that that's a start. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:10
JANINA FISHER That, and uh, and that's, uh, that's a way of working, that's, uh, inspired by sensory motor psychotherapy. This idea that, um, that the tiniest step is often more helpful than bigger leaps. Because a tiny, tiny step, can build. 

00:31:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:31:35
JANINA FISHER Right? We can add another tiny little step to that and another tiny little step to that. And, uh, and that is a more, essentially builds the foundation in a more solid way. 

00:31:50
RICH SIMON So take us through it then. So, so let's, if, if, if with this case, with this particular client, or anybody that you choose, say you've, you, you've introduced a way in which I can, as the client, I can identify, uh, look at my experience differently, I have these parts, I have a language for them, I have this ex-, even more important, I have an experience of comforting myself, and these two parts, maybe are both me, all those things, and that's the beginning of a process, there's no magic about that that's the beginning of something, where does the process go from there? 

00:32:30
JANINA FISHER Um, I think, if I use this same case, um, he has overcome the fear of flying, because he now rides with this little boy on his lap. 

00:32:50
RICH SIMON That's lovely. 

00:32:50
JANINA FISHER So, so, and, uh, that, it was very, very interesting because yesterday we had the, the stuck place around new issues. Um, but, uh, he came in saying very proudly, guess what, while you were away, I went to New York, uh, uh, on the plane, my next, my next goal is to be able to go to foreign countries. 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:33:20
JANINA FISHER And, uh, and then, uh, and then, we started to work on the next issue that's, uh, come up for him, which is his relationship with his girlfriend, uh, who is one of a string of relationships, all of which have failed. Uh, and, uh, and this relationship is now, uh, on very shaky ground. 

00:33:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:33:50
JANINA FISHER So, once again, we're exploring the, the parts that come up for him, in the tense or conflictual moments in this relationship. 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON Yeah, so when the little, little guy comes up makes a little different story. 

00:34:10
JANINA FISHER Absolutely, when she, right, she hurts the little guy's feelings. Right. Terrible that spouses and partners do that to each other. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, that's where they have a partic-, a expertise. 

00:34:30
JANINA FISHER Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. 

00:34:30
RICH SIMON So, part of this, this way of working, it's, so we're saying there's not a, um, magic in identifying a part, it's helpful. 

00:34:40
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. 

00:34:40
RICH SIMON It's the beginning of something and is it more as if it becomes a kind of, rather than, as we perhaps once hoped, we have it in sight, we're transformed forever, and it's sort of the insight that sets us free, is it, in your experience, more, is it, we begin to develop a practice. So when this, you know, and all the sudden, some version, I would imagine, so when the, the airplane situation. Okay, so I'm feeling this, let me get this child part of me, this vulnerable part, I'm gonna put it in my lap, let me comfort it, and that becomes a practice that, again, that's not magical, it just something that you do and integrate into the way you handle your emotions. 

00:35:25
JANINA FISHER Right, right. Um, yes, I, you know, I think we all have that experience, as therapists, that there are still, uh, people who come to us and are simple and straight forward. They're having a life crisis. Uh, there's been a death in the family. They're going through a divorce. Um, they're, uh, those clients do exist, but there are also, I find, many, many clients who have these cracks in their foundation. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:36:05
JANINA FISHER And the, where what will apparently be simple and smooth, can turn out to be long term therapy that we didn't plan on. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:20
JANINA FISHER Uh, and, and that's okay! Uh, I, I actually think for many of these clients, who have been going to therapy for years and decades, in search of relief, it's when we finally identify those cracks as attachment related, uh, abandoned child parts. If you think of what happens when we grow up and we have to reject the part of us that, uh, feels ashamed to be seen, because we've got to go on the job interview. Right? I remember, uh, my first job, uh, was as a family service worker at a school for autistic children. And I had a, a fear of phone calling that I really attribute to a young part of myself, right? Who was afraid that somebody might hang up on her, probably. Or that she's say the wrong thing and, and upset somebody, anger somebody. And I remember the first day of work my supervisor saying, "your job will be to call all the parents, and let them know that you're here and available for them. And I remember the the kind of panic, and then, uh, the I got down. Right, now I wish I had had this, thirty years ago! 

00:37:50
RICH SIMON That's right, would've been a big help! 

00:37:55
JANINA FISHER A big help! As opposed to the stiff upper lip, uh, approach. But in that moment, I had to reject the part of me that was afraid to make the phone calls, because those phone calls had to be made. I think we all do this, our clients do it... 

00:38:10
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:38:10
JANINA FISHER Um, and, you know, and so this process of reclaiming those lost, uh, abandoned, rejected, uh, selves can, in some people be a very quick process, but in others it takes a while. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Now, as, as you were describing this particular client, from what you said so far, it's, it's not as if we have some capital 'T' trauma in his life, and it's, uh, let's clarify this and how you see it, so it's not as if there's something that we might necessarily identify as some horrible abuse, or something that raises, rises to that level of, of an incident or a, a very abusive and damaging relationship. But it's, there's, it can be something else that is, um... 

00:39:15
JANINA FISHER Yes. 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON How would you describe it? What is it that, uh, what, you're, you're using this, your metaphor is crack in the foundation. So if you were to impact that, uh, metaphor a bit more, what is it, what happened. What is it that happens for so many of us that leads to this, that is this crack in the foundation. What's, what's, what's happened, and what is it that we can, uh, how can therapy help with that? 

00:39:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Well, I suppose if, if we think that, um, of the foundation as, um, child development, as the attachment relationship... 

00:39:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
JANINA FISHER ...um, for, for this client, we, he happened to just mention, incidently, "Oh, by the way, I had several surgeries as a baby, in the first year of life. Do you suppose that could have anything to do with anything?" 

00:40:10
RICH SIMON I see. 

00:40:10
JANINA FISHER Right. Now, especially for somebody in his fifties, that was an era where we didn't have hospitals that were attachment savy. 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:25
JANINA FISHER Right, I think any of us, in our fifties or sixties, uh, if we had surgery, if we had medical treatments, uh, we did it by ourselves. 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:40:40
JANINA FISHER And so, uh, he also had a sense, almost like a, uh, a sense memory, that he, um, his mother was too horrified by seeing him as, imagine how a baby comes out of surgery. Uh, it's not, it's an alarming sight. As I know, having had a son who had surgery as an infant. Um, and, uh, and he said I just have a feeling that she couldn't even bare to look at me. 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:41:15
JANINA FISHER So, early medical trauma, right that we would consider that early medical trauma. So I think a lot of these clients have some early trama that nobody may have identified as trauma. Who would think? I don't routinely ask did you every have any childhood surgeries or medical problems. Right, um... 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON When did this information emerge in your work with this gentleman? 

00:41:45
JANINA FISHER Um, well, it helped us to, and again, this may be right or wrong... 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON When was this? How far into... 

00:41:50
JANINA FISHER This, this was probably, um, probably three or four months in. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON Oh, okay, oh okay. 

00:42:00
JANINA FISHER And it's also, um, been interesting because it was, um, it was stomach surgery, uh, that he, one of his, the primary symptom he associates with this ashamed little boy, is feeling sick to his stomach. Uh, so, so I think if we start to look at, uh, at the atttachment histories of ourselves or our clients, we may see the potential cracks. Right, um, a mother who was depressed, a mother who lost a parent somewhere before, or just after the child's birth. Um, the, a miscarriage, loss of a sibling, I worked for the woman who, who was the replacement baby for a still born, uh, child. And so, so I think there are very obvious cracks in the foundation that come from abuse, then there are these much more subtle ones. I generally asked all clients, uh, I tend not to take a lot of history at the beginning, but I do ask, when you were growing up were either of your parents frightening? 

00:43:25
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:43:25
JANINA FISHER And, and then when they answer that, I say, and when you were growing up, did either of your parents ever appear frightened? Uh, because those are the two questions about, that elicit, um, disorganized attachment, uh, data. Or non-abuse types of threat. 

00:43:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:50
JANINA FISHER Right? So, my father never laid a hand on me but we watched him, uh, beat up my mother, or we watched him verbally, uh, degrade her in front of us every night at the dinner table. So, and it was scary. So when those details ermerge, that's not trauma-trauma, or big 'T' trauma, as we think of it, but you know, the disorganized attachment research says that the, the effects of frightened and frightening characters have an eery resemblance to the symptoms of trauma. 

00:44:35
RICH SIMON What a simple and, and, uh, elegant way of getting at that without having a lot of preamble. 

00:44:40
JANINA FISHER Right, right. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON And it speaks, and it speaks to the child part also. It's a simple language. 

00:44:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Right. Absolutely, great. Yeah. 

00:44:50
RICH SIMON So, in the, so, in getting back to this extremely illuminating case that seems to have all these different layers to it, and gets at something beyond this, this one person's experience. So it, so the process for someone like this in your work with them, uh, when's it done? What does it look like? I mean, and we all have, I would think, it gets hard to get through a childhood without bumps along the way so we have... 

00:45:25
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:45:25
RICH SIMON ...moments of feeling absolutely overwhelmed and abandoned and extremely alone. 

00:45:30
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. 

00:45:30
RICH SIMON Um, I guess there are two question. One is, so is this relevant for everyone, is this just sort of, uh, is this kind of work that you're describing, uh, do all of us need to take this trip back into childhood and identify this, is there a crack in all of our foundations at some level? Sometimes it's a hairline fracture. That's collapsed, that we're, we're really in bad shape. Why not, let's start with that one. 

00:46:00
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. Or you've repaired the foundation in our, you know, as Allan Shore talks about earned secure attachment, where we've repaired the cracks through healthy relationships and, and, uh, good therapy and... 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:46:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Um, you know, uh, I, I, myself find that there are people with whom I don't necessarily use this lens or this language. 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:46:30
JANINA FISHER But, it, you know I recently had a case that looked easy, actually turn out to be easy. At about the same time that this... 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON It does happen! 

00:46:40
JANINA FISHER It does happen! 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:46:45
JANINA FISHER Which we very recently finished her therapy. I, I don't call it terminated, I call it graduated, so she recently graduated, uh, from therapy. And the interesting thing was that, along the we'd had a couple of sessions in which I talked about young, a young part of her. Uh, the young part of her that craved connection and a sense of acceptance and being loved. And when she was summarizing what she was gonna take away from the therapy, she said, "and I'll never forget that session when we talked about the child that needs the affirmation and love of other people". So even though hat hadn't been the central way I worked with her, um, during this, um, roughly ten month therapy. It still spoke to her. 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:45
JANINA FISHER So, um, so I'm finding I'm just using this lens more and more. And especially for people who are having difficulties in relationships. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:00
JANINA FISHER Because, uh, as you have said to me many, many times, that old addage about we have to love ourselves, um, before we can love, or feel love, by others. Um, we can make concrete by working with these, these... 

00:48:20
RICH SIMON Abandonded... 

00:48:20
JANINA FISHER ...abandonded child parts. 

00:48:20
RICH SIMON So let me go, return now to the second part of my overly complicated question... 

00:48:25
JANINA FISHER Which I'd forgotten. 

00:48:30
RICH SIMON ...and, and, and, and so that will bring me back and we're moving towards then end of our time. So when's it done? How do we know when we're... 

00:48:35
JANINA FISHER Oh, yeah! 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON ...ready to graduate. Where does, so you, you, the often with therapy, the beginning part of the process is much clearer than the end, ending part, so where do you... 

00:48:50
JANINA FISHER Absolutely! 

00:48:50
RICH SIMON Could be a lifetime learning to adept yourself and, you know... 

00:48:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:48:55
RICH SIMON ...fix yourself and all that, in terms of how you operate as a therapist, when do you feel, and, and work out with the client, here, here's the time for us to stop. 

00:49:05
JANINA FISHER Well, as you know, it's interesting I always, uh, uh, remember the words of my own first therapist, who, uh, as I was becoming a therapist, uh, gave me some words of advice, uh, professional to professional, and, uh, he used to say, you know I'd say, well, how do you know when it's done, and he says, he used to say, "you know when you're when you're done when you got what you came for". 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:49:35
JANINA FISHER And that that's really a sense, now we would say it's a sense in the body. Oh, I got what I came for. This woman who just graduated really felt she got what she came for. There are other issues that she could have stayed and worked on. 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:00
JANINA FISHER And that in a way, I was hoping she would stay and work on because she was such a delightful client. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:05
JANINA FISHER Um, but she had this feeling "I'm done", and I would say 90% of the time, I wait for the client to have that sense of doneness. Rather than doing what I was trained to do, which was to set a termination date and work toward it. Uh, the only time I do that is when it's clear that the client needs to be the bird who's able to leave the nest. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:40
JANINA FISHER So I've had a few cases where I had to set a graduation date for peole who would have otherwise gone to the nursing home with me. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON And because what? They, they were afraid that you, they might hurt you if they moved on or what's the bond? What keeps them from leaving the next, that sort of client? 

00:51:05
JANINA FISHER I think it's the, I think there can be many flavors of his phenomenon. 

00:51:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:51:10
JANINA FISHER Um, one flavor, uh, is, uh, the, the person who has a child part that is a afraid to be alone, or afraid to be on his or her own. And so, often times it can look like a kind of addiction to therapy. 

00:51:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:51:35
JANINA FISHER And, uh, and you can see it in, uh, sort of, I'm almost better, but I'm having a crisis again. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:45
JANINA FISHER The most recent person I did that with had been in 25 years of therapy before she met me. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON Oh dear. Okay. 

00:51:55
JANINA FISHER And, and after five years, I really felt the greatest issue that she's struggling with right now, is this fear that she actually can't function without helping professionals propping her up. 

00:52:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:52:10
JANINA FISHER And, um... 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON 20 years, where did she get that idea? 

00:52:15
JANINA FISHER Yes, I wonder. I know. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Um... 

00:52:25
RICH SIMON And so, and so, um, I see, so for the most the time though, it's, it's, it's, your senses that the clients, the people have to have a sense. It's, it's their time, they bring it up and that, that's really how the process goes and there's a kind of a to the relationship. 

00:52:40
JANINA FISHER Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:52:45
RICH SIMON Alright, well, look, we have, um, uh, that, um, get such a strong sense of what it would be like to, uh, to work with you in the, kind of this atmosphere that you're creating in your therapy, that people who are interested in, um, finding out more about your work and some resources, training opportunities, things to read, where do they go? 

00:53:10
JANINA FISHER Um, certainly they can read the case study in the July issue. My website is, uh, www.JaninaFisher.com, and there are some papers that people can download uh, that I've written over the years. Um, also, workshops and trainings that I may be teaching, and, uh, and I also have uh, um, online, uh, teaching events that also people can check out. And uh, and, uh, I think, let's see, anything el-, oh, I know, how could I forget, the, also, the Century Motor Psychotherapy website. Uh, I highly recommend as a premier to all this, uh, uh, Pat Ogden's "Trauma And The Body". Um, Nancy Napier's wonderful book "Getting Through The Day". Uh, which, uh, taught me so much about doing this kind of work. It's great for clients, um, and, of course, Dick Schwartz, uh, "Internal Family Systems". 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So, I, I think one other thing that you really exemplify is this ability to take in these various influences, these various models and then do something that is very distinctively your own/ 

00:54:40
JANINA FISHER Oh, thank you, thank you. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON It's such an interesting and, uh, humane way. Powerful way. S-s, um, so those, again, as we do each time, let me invite those of you who've been watching this conversation to contribute to it. The comment board is on this page, take a moment now, your thoughts, some a-ha you had, something that happened for you, maybe you had wound up comforting your version of the child that manages to invoke the feeling and, and some traumadity. Whatever it is, questions you have, just, uh, let's continue the converstaion. Janina has agreed to, uh, look at the comment board, there's not guarantee that you'll get a response, but it'll, um, it's just within our group. Uh, there's, this is our way of keeping the conversation going, making sure this has a ripple effect which, uh, I'm sure it will. Janina, what a pleasure to spend, I, I'm... 

00:55:45
JANINA FISHER The same. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON I feel not alone! 

00:55:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah, oh good! I'm glad, I'm glad. 

00:55:50
RICH SIMON Thank you so much, really get such a vivid sense of how you work and, um, and how to work so, uh, sensitively and intimately with people, such a caring way, it, it's such elegance. 

00:56:10
JANINA FISHER Thank you. Thank you. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON And, uh, and that's it for this installment of this webcast series. Good-bye for now, see you next time.
