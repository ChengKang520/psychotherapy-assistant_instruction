this letter came - out of the blue they want to see all my client's notes. I'm worried. 

00:00:00
The Police came to my door 

00:00:00
I can't believe what my client has just told me 

00:00:00
I don't know where I stand 

00:00:00
I'm worried about the work 

00:00:00
DO I HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY SAY? 

00:00:00
what about my client?

MIKE SIMMONS Hello. My name's Mike Simmons. It can sometimes be easy to imagine that counseling is something that takes place within a bit of a bubble. We understand that there are limitations to client confidentiality, that there are occasions when our work might attract the interest of the legal system for some reason or another, but not so many of us have the experience of that actually happening. When it does happen, we can often take on the demeanor of a headless chicken, not sure what we should do, what we ought to do, what we must do, and so on. I'm joined in the studio today by Peter Jenkins. 

00:01:15
PETER JENKINS Hello. 

00:01:15
MIKE SIMMONS Peter is gonna help us find the answers to these questions. He's the author of several books on the topic, including the very well-received Sage publication, Counseling, Psychotherapy, and the Law, he's a member of the UK CP Ethics Committee, and he's run a considerable number of workshops exploring the legal aspects of therapy. So, Peter, where do we start? 

00:01:45
PETER JENKINS Well, the law is something I think, um, that creates a lot of anxiety for, for counselors and therapists for a number of reasons, and I think part of it is that it's an unfamiliar area, it's not something that we often encounter, it seems to speak a different language to the language of therapy, it's very formal and it seems very, very clinical and very, uh, very black and white in its approach. And it's not something that we are trained for in our, the training that we do as therapists and, and counselors. So when that letter from a solicitor comes or the court order requesting our records or the knock on the door from the police, I, I think many of us tend to go into, into panic mode, and that's not surprising, that, uh, it's, it's really something that's unexpected, that we're not, uh, we're not trained for, as I say, and really catches us unawares. It seems to challenge a lot of the, the values and principles that underpin our therapeutic role which is a very private, very personal engagement with another individual, and the law seems to be very formal, very, very public, um, very documented, as opposed to being interpersonal. So I, I think for many therapists, it really does set the, the dovecotes rattling, if you like, and, uh, puts us on the back foot. I don't think it needs to be that way, and that the purpose of this tape is, is not to prepare us to be lawyers or to become legal experts, I, I don't think that's necessary, but simply to offer some basic ground rules, if you like, so that when we encounter different aspects of the law, we have some basic knowledge to fall back on. Uh, there is more support than people are aware of, I think, and that's something we can also look at in terms of when we encounter legal issues, who do we turn to, where do we get that kind of support, and we will be mentioning that in, in the, the DVD. I think part of the complexity of the law is that it's not easy to give a, a straightforward answer in terms of reading off, "Well, in this situation, you must do this." I mean, if you're working perhaps with a suicidal client or, um, if you have concerns about a child who may be at risk of abuse, that very often it may be the case that your supervisor or your colleagues or your tutors will say, "Well, you must do this." Often it is more nuanced than that. It is more gray than, than black and white. Very briefly, the, the responses that we have as therapist to, the way that the law impacts upon us relates partly to the nature of the client group that we're working with. So I work, are we working with children, young people under 18, for example, because then there are specific bits of the law we would need to know. It relates also to where we work. So, do we work in the statutory sector, perhaps we're social services or in education or in a health care setting, or do we work in voluntary organization or in private practice? And depending upon the answers, that will impact upon the kind of responses we might need. And thirdly, the, the other, perhaps more curious, uh, factor that comes into play is whether we are employed or acting as if employed, and that may, probably strike therapists as rather strange, but it's absolutely crucial in terms of the kinds of responsibilities that might fall to us and the things that we can or can't do. 

00:05:35
MIKE SIMMONS And something I have been conscious of, talking to people who've been in the position of coming in contact with the law in some way, is that whoever is representing the law, who, whoever is asking for something seems incredibly certain that they have the right to have it. 

00:05:45
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. And I think that really is a challenge because part of our training as therapists is to move away from certainty and to entertain, I suppose, often quite difficult notions of ambiguity or multiple meanings or resonances so that everything becomes negotiated. To come across perhaps, um, a psychiatrist who's absolutely adamant that this needs to be done or a police officer who is in no mood to negotiate the meaning of whatever, uh, or a solicitor who simply sees that you have to do this, and you have to do it now, I think that, that's quite difficult for us because that is a very different way of, of working. 

00:06:30
MIKE SIMMONS And unconscious as well. Sometimes the solicitor who acting in the interests of one of our clients, and then, "Oh, gosh, what do I do there?" 

00:06:40
PETER JENKINS Yes, yes. I mean, I, I think that can also set up quite, uh, difficult contradictions because, as a counselor, we would also like to think that we're working in the client's best interest, and to have another professional come in for whatever reason to state very adamantly that this is what needs to happen and this is what we needs to do, uh, is, is not an easy position to be in. And, I mean, I would stress at this point that of course what we're looking at, what we're discussing is simply my take, my interpretation of the law as it relates to England and Wales, and then the legal principles apply throughout the UK, but specifically with regard to England and Wales. I'm not legally qualified, although I do have a background as a social worker, so I have some, some background experience in the law. And just to remind viewers that if they have any queries about particular cases then they need to get expert legal advise. This is a broad-brush approach to basic legal principles. 

00:07:45
MIKE SIMMONS And maybe a bit of direction in where to go, where to look. 

00:07:50
PETER JENKINS Absolutely, yes. We will look at that, at, that the, I think the close of this, this particular tape. 

00:07:55
MIKE SIMMONS So where do you wanna make a start? 

00:07:55
PETER JENKINS Well, I think perhaps if we were to look at some of the, the scenarios and try to look at some of the ethical and professional and, and legal issues that these raise. I guess another point that I would like to try and convey is that although the law is something that we do need to respond to, to be aware of, the ethical framework requires us to, to, uh, to have a, a working knowledge of the law and to be accountable. It may not always be the last word in every situation. I, I would hope that our decisions are driven as much by an ethical sense as by simply, well, the law says this and we have to do it. 

00:08:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So, you said the scenario. It's a group of us got together and recorded a whole series of scenarios for this program. Uh, we'll have a look at the first one. 

00:08:50
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. Yes, yep. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN I gave a client of mine a relaxation tape a couple of weeks ago. What I didn't realize, though, was I recorded it over a recording of a supervision session that I'd had the week before with my supervisor in which I was talking about this same client. And the trouble is, I was being pretty blunt about him, blunt about my feelings about him, and now he's heard what I've said. He's not just upset, he's not just angry, he's also threatening to use me. 

00:09:25
MIKE SIMMONS Looks like that was a particularly bad hair day for me. Okay, what are the issues here? 

00:09:30
PETER JENKINS Well, uh, I think the bad hair day is, is, is putting it mildly. I mean, this must be a nightmare scenario. In fact, it is a real situation. This did happen to, um, a psychologist, a member of the BPS, British Psychological Society. So it may be that our, our worst nightmares do actually come true on occasion. I suppose the, we have to try and separate out some of the, the therapeutic issues and the professional issues from the ones which perhaps are more strictly legal. And I guess, as a therapist, the first starting point would be just that sense of something having gone dramatically wrong. Um, I guess we could call that a rupture in the therapeutic relationship here. You, the therapist has a, a, an aggrieved, very angry, very stressed, and understandably so, client, and simply at a professional level, at a therapeutic level, there is a need for the therapist to acknowledge that something that gone drastically wrong. I know that insurance companies get very twitchy at this point. It's a bit like, uh, bumping into someone in your car in that you never apologize because that might be an admission of, uh, responsibility. But I, I think at a therapeutic level, it would be crucial to acknowledge the feelings of distress and, um, the fact that something had apparently gone wrong, that the tapes have been mixed up. This is clearly not a relaxation tape. If anything, it's a, it's a tape which has engendered a great deal of stress. So it does raise some, I suppose interesting questions about supervision, to start with, in that, I mean, an immediate question is was the client aware that their material was being taken to supervision? I suppose one would assume that we inform every client that we take material to supervision where it's anonymized and this is for professional purposes and so on. 

00:11:45
MIKE SIMMONS You'd think that that would be part of the initial contract the therapist had with the client when they first met. 

00:11:50
PETER JENKINS I think one would assume so. Um, of course, it may be that the, the therapist overlooked including that in the contract with a verbal contract. Um, maybe they didn't tell the client, maybe the client hasn't remembered. But I guess the shock of hearing the material from supervision on the tape might be compounded by the realization that this very private material was being taken to a third party in any case. And there is a point of view that's certainly around within the States, but I've heard it mentioned also within the UK that we should have explicit client consent for taking their material to supervision which is, it's, and I can see the arguments for this. I think it's something of an extreme position. 

00:12:40
MIKE SIMMONS It's an interesting one, because on the side of that, how could you work ethically and effectively without doing that? 

00:12:50
PETER JENKINS Well, yes. I mean, I, I guess, um, the, the rider is that to comply with our own ethical framework and professional expectations, agency requirements, that the understanding is that we take client material to supervision. And I guess the rider is that if we don't have explicit client consent, then at least the material is anonymized so the client is not identifiable. I mean, it's an interesting position. I, I think it's a slightly legalistic one, but, uh, certainly there is a point of view. It does beg the question, what would you then do with to regards to processing client material where the client had explicitly refused consent? You'd be in something of a (inaudible ) state then. So, um, I guess for me, the normal safeguards for anonymized material, um, would be sufficient protection for most, most clients. It also raises, I think, a lot of questions about what is the nature of the discussion in supervision that the client is finding so offensive and, and so upsetting. And it may be just simply the shock of hearing them talked about in that way, but perhaps the therapist in supervision is using language or expressing views which come as something of a shock to, to the client. I mean, it may be that the therapist is saying, "Oh, this is a client I have real difficulty with. I can't stand the way they just go on and on. They remind me of my mother," I mean, who knows. Is it necessarily unprofessional is a moot point, I think, because it may be that this particular client evokes very powerful, I mean, we might call it counter-transference, so we might call it, um, emotional responses or whatever. Maybe the therapist is using supervision in quite an appropriate way so that they are exploring their own material, their own process, they are preparing to be congruent with the client and to, to go back and to voice some of these feelings. So maybe in, this is hypothetical, maybe on the tape the therapist is saying, well, I seriously think that this particular client has a personality disorder. I can imagine a client being outraged, but, and that may not be language that every therapist would feel comfortable using, but is it necessarily derogatory or offensive? Is it indefensible? Arguably, this is exactly the kind of material the therapist should be taking to supervision. So from an ethical and professional point of view, the content could be entirely professional and appropriate. There was something in the old BAC Code of Ethics which predated the ethical framework which talked about discussion of clients in supervision should be, um, should not be trivializing or derogatory. I think that's a useful kind of peg to, to hang onto with this, uh, this particular incident. So assuming that it's not gratuitously offensive to the, to the client, that it, it can be justified in professional terms, then the, the content of the supervision tape needn't in itself be cause for action. I think what we're looking at is a situation where the tape has gone back to the client and clearly should not have done, and that raises a number of then potentially legal questions for the, the therapist and the client. The client is actually threatening to sue the therapist here. 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS Uh, and I guess there's one thing here, this feels like an ex-client. It's hard to imagine the therapist being able to work well enough with that client in the future to overcome this rupture. 

00:16:45
PETER JENKINS I guess that's the therapeutic issue, isn't it? I mean, there, there are writers like Safran who talk about therapeutic rupture and the possibility of repairing what might seem to be traumatic or irreversible breakdowns of communication. And he suggests that where you can do this, where you can repair, and it may take an apology and a, and a fair amount of working through. Then the therapeutic alliance can actually in a curious way benefit from that breakdown, and levels of trust can, can be established at a much higher level. It's the, it is as through the, the power relationship between therapist and client has become much more equalized. The therapist is no longer, can no longer pretend to be, um, on a pedestal, if they ever did. They're on much more level playing ground. In legal terms, the, the client is upset, understandably, and they're talking about suing. Well, suing is a very particular legal term, and I guess what they would mean by that would be taking legal action for negligence. So the argument would be, in very strict legal terms, that the therapist had been negligent and they had caused damage to the client by giving them the tape where, of, of the supervision session. Now, to cut a long story short, it's unlikely that that would succeed in, as a legal action, that the, the test for negligence is of a very high order. Essentially, the client has to experience psychiatric injuries, they have to, um, experience either clinical depression or severe anxiety or PTSD. It's unlikely, I would think, that the, the client's upset and distress would count as being of, of that order. So it's unlikely that it would go to, to a case for negligence. Is it grounds for an action for defamation? So 

00:18:50
MIKE SIMMONS Well, that's what I was wondering 'cuz there's the evidence of, of this conversation taking place. 

00:18:55
PETER JENKINS Well, absolutely. So, uh, the, the client has the tape, and they have the unfavorable references to them as a difficult or unrewarding client. Again, the, there're very strict criteria, and I suppose this is where the law differs from therapy, 'cuz we, we're acknowledging the distress and the upset, however, defamation, there're very particular tests for this about, uh, lowering the reputation of the, the client, the applicant in the legal case in the eyes of the society at large and so on. And it would be hard to see how a private tape of a private supervision session could be seen to have that kind of, uh, impact. 

00:19:40
MIKE SIMMONS Well, but, but I, I was imagining a scenario where the counselor is discussing with the supervisor whether or not this client is abusing his 14-year-old step-daughter. 

00:19:55
PETER JENKINS That, I guess, I mean, that would be quite a difficult situation. Again, the question would be what grounds would the therapist have for having those concerns, what would the evidence be, and, again, if that discussion was entirely appropriate, if it was measured, if it wasn't, again, uh, simply offensive towards the, the client, but was a professional consideration of the issues, that may well be seen to be evidence of a very proper, reasoned, appropriate professional response on the part of the therapist. And the other final grounds might be for breach of confidence. So the argument may be from the client, well, okay, I haven't suffered permanent psychiatric damage on account of this, um, I'm, my reputation hasn't been permanently damaged, but there's a breach of confidentiality that I expected that what I disclose is confidential, and it clearly isn't because it's on a tape that could have gone to perhaps another client as a relaxation tape, uh, it's come back to me. Now, that would probably be the one that a solicitor would look at with most interest, I think. Has there been a breach of confidence? However, the, in a curious way, there is a loop here because the material has gone from the client to the counselor, the counselor has taken it to supervision and recorded it, and the tape has then gone back to the original client, so in a sense, there's been no breach. If the tape had gone to another client, then arguably, and of course, if the client could've been identified from that, uh, one wonders, uh, what else is on the tape. Is there discussion of other clients that this client may potentially identify? So, but if we stick with the presenting issue of the client's material coming back to them, the, the record of, of discussion in supervision, again, on the face of it, it would seem there hasn't actually been a breach of, of confidentiality. This may be a very narrow squeak for the counselor, and a, and a (inaudible ) lesson, but I would suspect that there isn't actually grounds for legal action here. And what we do have, and what the client would clearly have, would be grounds for a professional complaint. And of course, that's not a legal procedure, but for a complaint to be entertained by BACP, or in this case, BPS, then what the client would have to demonstrate would be that there was a duty of care, that is that the therapist had to behave in a, a professional way, and that there had been a breach of that standard. So they wouldn't have to prove that they had experienced psychiatric damage as a result of that, which they would do if they went to a legal case. So I think there's much more mileage, if that's the right term, for the client in terms of taking a professional complaint. And I understand that was the client did in fact take with this, rather than going down the road of trying to seek legal action which probably would, uh, not be possible because of the very strict criteria that the law then applies to these kinds of situations. 

00:23:20
MIKE SIMMONS And I'm very familiar, and I guess you are too, with the concept of writing for disclosure, that if you write something, we need to be aware that someone may someday ask to see it. This feels like there's, there's a bit of a hint here of speaking for disclosure too. Certainly if you're recording, watch your saying. 

00:23:40
PETER JENKINS Well, one would hope that the therapist had gone through a very thorough contracting process with the client in the first place, the client fully understood that they agreed to anonymized material going to supervision, they had an understanding of that, and also perhaps that the client would agree to the taping of that supervision session which might, might be an unusual process. I mean, I know that supervisors sometimes record supervision, perhaps for their own training purposes, but at the end of the day, it's the, the client's material here, and one needs to be mindful of confidentiality. I guess there's a wider lesson behind this which is the law does take confidentiality very seriously indeed, and there are very strong legal defenses for it. So it may feel as therapists that the, the law is unfamiliar with work as, in therapy, that it's unsympathetic. The law is very, very strongly disposed to protecting confidentiality, particularly client confidentiality, and it does it, this through common law, the law of contracts, it applies also through the developing law on privacy, and the expectation that if there's a conversation, for example, we understood this to be a private conversation, then one, both of us would be bound to keep it confidential. Clearly, we're, we're making this as a training program. 

00:25:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hopefully it's not. 

00:25:10
PETER JENKINS It's not confidential, but, I mean, if there was a reasonable expectation that what we were disclosing, very private, very personal material, it then, the other person is bound to, to keep it confidential. This is something which has a lot of publicity at the moment in terms of newspaper reporting or, um, royalty, football stars, media stars, and so on. And, and the other defense for confidentiality, very briefly, is through the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. Human Rights Act 1998, Article 8 gives the individual citizen the right, not to privacy, but respect for privacy. So these are the big guns, if you like. The law and the courts take confidentiality very seriously, and I guess as therapists, we should take heart from that, that they, uh, really do see our work as being important enough to, to protect with the full force of the law. 

00:26:10
MIKE SIMMONS That sounds good. Should we move onto the next scenario? 

00:26:10
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN I'm counseling a potentially suicidal client at the moment, and he's indicated to me his intention to take his, uh, take his life, to take a fatal overdose, and I'm just wondering what to do. And I'm working at the moment in the health center, and I'm thinking, should I tell the client's GP what the client has told me? 

00:26:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so what are the issues here? 

00:26:40
PETER JENKINS Very complex. Um, I guess, again, this is the kind of situation that every counselor will probably experience at some time, um, with an actively suicidal client, uh, something that no doubt will be very stressful and really challenge them in, in personal and professional terms. In legal terms, it raises the issue of responsibility for another person's wellbeing, ultimately for, for their life. I think that for many counselors, the assumption may be that we have a duty, possibly a legal duty, to intervene to prevent someone from taking their, their own life, and that if we fail to do this, that we ourselves could be liable, we could be at risk in some way of legal action against us besides the, um, the ethical, the therapeutic, the professional consequences where someone has, has taken their own life and perhaps as a counselor, we had information that may have been very relevant to preventing that, that situation. In terms of the law, the, the starting point is the Suicide Act, 1961, and this act was brought in and the effect of it was to mean that to attempt or to commit suicide was no longer a legal offense, it was no longer a criminal offense. Now, I mean, that may seem slightly strange in that, obviously if someone commits suicide successfully, then the law really, it's too late for the law to intervene, but it does have implications for those who have knowledge of someone who may be potentially suicidal, and Section 1 particularly relates to trying to prevent suicide pacts where perhaps one or, uh, two or three people come together and the, the intention is to, to commit suicide on a joint basis. And of course, it, what often happens in that situation is that where two people agree to, to take their own lives, perhaps in the case of one of them, it's not successful. And then the question would be, well, would the other person have gone through with the suicide attempt if they had known that the other person had survived? And the law does provide quite, uh, stringent punishment for the surviving party to a suicidal pact. And you do read about it occasionally in the papers. So under Section 1 of the Suicide Act, 1961, it's, it is a, a criminal offense to, to actively advise someone or to counsel someone, I don't mean counsel in a therapeutic sense, but to, to really strongly push them towards taking their own life, and that remains the case, and there has been a huge amount of publicity about this recently in terms of assisted suicide and, uh, you know, there is a great deal of discussion about this, but it still remains the case that if someone actively helps someone to take their own life, then they do run the risk of criminal prosecution, and the sentence could be anything up to 14 years, so this is a very serious, uh, offense in the eyes of the law. Now, assuming a therapist is not actively involved in helping the client to commit suicide, then the question is, how much information does the counselor have about the state of mind of this person and their, their intention to commit suicide? And it's interesting within the tape that the therapist say, is saying that they work in a health center. Now, within the NHS, I think there is a very strong review that the dominant ethical position is that the, the general practitioner, the consultant psychiatrist, the lead medic has a duty of care towards their, their patient, whether it's, um, a patient in a health center or a psychiatric patient or whatever, and that there's a very strong assumption that ethically, they must do everything in their power to prevent this person from taking their own life. So from an ethical framework, we're looking at beneficence and promoting the welfare of the, the client or the patient or non-malfeasance, that is, avoiding harm. But these are strictly ethical and professional perspectives. There's, perhaps surprisingly, there's no legal obligation to prevent the practitioner from intervening, and of course, in practical terms, it is extremely difficult. If someone is absolutely determined to, to take their own life, then, uh, they may be admitted to a psychiatric unit, they could be in custody for other reasons, and of course, we know that people manage to, to carry out successful suicides in a whole variety of situations where they're very closely monitored. But even, uh, admitting someone with very strong suicidal ideas, perhaps to a psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act 2007 is not in itself a cast-iron way of preventing them from do, from doing this. We do know that people do kill themselves, unfortunately, even when they're under very close observation, that, it, it's not a foolproof way, foolproof way of doing this. 

00:32:20
MIKE SIMMONS Of course. I mean, I guess in the distress of that sort of situation, it would be relatives who would be saying, "You should've done something." 

00:32:30
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. Yes. Yeah, and, um, and, and I think the position of relatives is very much to be respected, and it may well be that they would be looking for answers from the counselor or therapist, it may well be that the, the family of the deceased person, that they are aware that this person was in counseling, that they were seeing a therapist, and it may even be that they know that the counselor was the last person or one of the last persons to, to see, uh, their loved one alive, it may be that the counselor is even mentioned in a suicide note. So, understandably, they would want answers to questions and it may be, and we know as therapists, that where there is death and loss, very strong feelings of anger and blame can be produced, and it may even be that in some way they blame the therapist or they blame the counselor for failing to act. If the counselor is working in a private care setting, I guess the expectation would be that they would have contracted with the patient, with the client that in the event of the client becoming suicidal or discussing suicidal ideas, that they would refer the patient or the client back to the GP, and that the, the patient or client would need to give their consent to that in the early stages of contracting. It, it does, while it seems to solve the problem at a practical level, I think it does raise additional concerns. What do you do if you're working with someone who's suicidal who says that they no longer give that consent to the referral back to the GP? They say, "Well, yes, I consented then; I don't want you to tell them." It's not as though you have a blank check because they've agreed to information in the past. I think the view within the NHS would be that the need to prevent self-destruction by the client or the patient would override the client's right to confidentiality, but we have a very interesting, a very stark conflict here between the rights of the individual to confidentiality and the assumed obligation of the therapist and the NHS personnel to intervene, in some cases, against the clients wishes in order to protect them from their self-destructive urges. And speaking widely, if you look at other approaches, then there are alternative views on suicide, and again, these used to be embodied within the old BAC Code of Ethics, and in terms of what you should do as a therapist in the case of a suicidal client, it said, well, on the one hand, you can break confidentiality, and on the other, you can respect client autonomy. So, in a sense, the therapist has a choice to make, and there is, I think, uh, a well-respected position within counseling and psychotherapy that if a client is suicidal, it isn't necessarily an indication that they're mentally ill. 

00:35:40
MIKE SIMMONS It can be a rational choice based on their life as it is. 

00:35:45
PETER JENKINS It could be a very reasoned and measured choice. So there is, if you like, an alternative view that the counselor, rather than rushing to break confidentiality or to work on the basis of consent within the original contract, could equally well respect the client's autonomous wishes and not intervene. Now that is clearly more of a high-risk position, not least for the client, also for the counselor. If you look at the work of the Samaritans, I mean, I, I appreciate Samaritans, are not strictly speaking a counseling organization, but their view is that their job is to accompany a suicidal caller in the last hours of their life, and not to intervene without the express permission or consent of the, the client, assuming the client is an adult, that they are over 18. 

00:36:40
MIKE SIMMONS Now this, this is all being in the context of the scenario that was in a very specific setting. I'm just wondering a bit about the, the counselor working in private practice. 

00:36:50
PETER JENKINS Well, this goes back to what I was suggesting at the beginning, that there are very few black-and-white rules with regard to the law which apply to all counselors equally, and I think that's part of counselors' frustration with the law, that it, you need to find out, well, are you in private practice, are you in NHS or what, what is the context. For a counselor working in private practice, then they would have a great of, of latitude on this issue, that they would not be bound within the law to intervene. Um, they could choose to, to intervene. And with all the situations that I've mentioned, there is this umbrella phrase, "in the public interest." It would be possibly in the public interest to, to break confidentiality with a suicidal client in order to contact the emergency services to prevent them where they seem to be at real risk of taking their own life. But the therapist could choose not to do so, and legally, they would not be directly at fault for doing so. 

00:38:00
MIKE SIMMONS We're now going to see an extraordinary conflict here because in some way, the therapist might reasonably see themselves as being part of the client's support mechanism, and quite clearly, in a sense, blowing the whistle on them is going to do nothing, uh, for the therapeutic relationship. 

00:38:20
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. I mean, that is the risk, and I, and I guess that risk would be true whether we're talking about this particular counselor in a health care setting, um, or whether we're talking about a therapist in private practice. And I guess it also raises professional questions, how well equipped is a therapist to assess risk of suicide? 'Cuz it may be that you're working with psychiatric patients, and not to stereotype them, but it may be that the, the treat to take their own life is something that is made on a, on a regular and frequent basis which is not that, that we take it any less, uh, any less seriously, but that may be more of a routine level of risk, if you like, for that therapist than where, working a client where suddenly they, they, there's a, a worsening of their mood and they begin to make quite serious statements about taking their own life. So it raises questions professional preparedness, I think, in terms of how well equipped or trained to accurately assess risk of suicide. And all the evidence seems to be that this is something which is extremely difficult to do before the event. After the event, one can almost always find the indicators. Before the event, it's, it's very difficult to do, so. 

00:39:35
MIKE SIMMONS I mean, I, I've also known people for whom the idea of suicide is actually a reassuring thing. "If this gets any worse, I've got a way out." And may be something that they talk quite freely to the therapist about, and then the therapist is trying to untangle whether it's a real possibility, but the client isn't actually that close to that possibility right now. 

00:40:00
PETER JENKINS And I guess it would perhaps be a measure of the strength of the therapeutic relationship that that option of suicide could be realistically appraised and monitored and discussed in an ongoing way, and for a therapist to hold that level of risk and perhaps their own level of anxiety, uh, rather than think, "I must report this." And I, it raises also questions in terms of how is the therapist supported within that context? So where do their, are they part of a multidisciplinary team, so is it simply on their own judgment or are they part of a much more supportive network, if you like? Just going back to the, the position of the family and the, the liability in more strict legal terms for the therapist, the outcome in the case of a successful suicide most likely be that there would be an inquest. So there would be a coroner's court held to inquire into the, the nature of the death of this, this client or this patient. Now, it may well be that the therapist is called to the inquest, and it may well feel to them in subjective terms that they are almost on trial. It could be they were expecting that their judgment may be questioned or their inaction or perhaps a late referral to the GP or whatever would be under scrutiny. In some cases, the inquest follows a very straightforward, um, procedure, and the counselor is there as a witness. So they are giving information about the nature of the contact with the client, the perception of the client's mood, perhaps, um, the level of, of suicidal thinking, and so on. And they're simply there to assist the coroner in deciding what was the intention of this person, and that's really the key question at, at the inquest, what was the intentionality? Did they intend to take their own life or was it a misadventure? So that can simply be, if you like, I mean, it's still harrowing, but it, it's a case of providing information for the, the court to make its, its finding. In other cases, it can feel much more conflicted. So the counselor may feel quite defensive, they may be vigorously cross-examined by, either by the coroner themselves, or by a solicitor acting on behalf of the, the family of the deceased, and in some cases, that can be quite a bruising experience. And the counselor can be challenged in terms of their, their status, their qualifications, their length of training, their expertise, whether or not they'd followed appropriate assessment risk protocols and so on. And for some counselors, that is a very, very difficult experience both at a personal level and professional level. At the end of the day, however, they're not on trial. It's not a, a criminal court, in that sense. It's in inquisitorial process. The purpose is to find the facts. So the therapist, however much it feels as though they're being cross-examined within an inch of their life, and their heart may be pounding, and so on, that they're simply there to provide information. 

00:43:20
MIKE SIMMONS But it might feel like they're in the dock. 

00:43:25
PETER JENKINS It may, I'm sure it may well feel like that, but at the end of the day, they're there as a witness, they step down from the witness box, they don't pay damages, they don't, um, there's no finding necessarily against the counselor for, for negligence or, or whatever. In fact, I mean, the law has been fairly circumspect about looking to, I suppose, pursue through the, through the courts people where someone has taken their own life. They, there's the beginnings of a shift here in that National Health Trust recently have been taken to court in the case of detained patients, involuntary patients where these patients have subsequently taken their own life, and the families felt that more should have been done. But that may be a straw in the wind, but I think that, um, counselors, in a very narrow legalistic sense, are not directly at risk from failing to act. Of course, they may be at risk from their employer if they fail to follow protocols, in this case, in a health care setting, then they, they could be disciplined or, or sacked for not following procedure. That's not quite the same as, as a legal process being brought against them. 

00:44:45
MIKE SIMMONS Might they be subject to any kind of action from the family? 

00:44:50
PETER JENKINS Not in the UK, not so far. I mean, there is case law in America, I mean, as always, uh, therapy case law in the States is much more extensive, um, it's kind of, I don't know, Technicolor, high-definition compared to the case law in, in the UK which tends to be somewhat black-and-white, but, um, there's analogies apart, that in America therapists can be legally at fault, they can be sued by the family for failing to prevent an actively suicidal patient from carrying out their wishes, but not in the UK. And people often say, well, what happens in the States happens here, but there's no indication that the courts are actually going down that, that particular road, apart from the, I suppose it's a, a message to NHS trusts about their responsibilities through the Human Rights Act, but that, that's rather different. 

00:45:50
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Shall we move on to the next scenario? 

00:45:50
PETER JENKINS Certainly, yeah. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN I'm counseling a consultant anesthetist who's told me that he's causing the deaths of several patients by unobtrusively curtailing their oxygen supply during complex operations. He's got no intention of stopping of his own accord, and he has no sense of guilt about his actions. 

00:46:15
MIKE SIMMONS Well, that sounds like a pretty scary one. 

00:46:15
PETER JENKINS I guess this must be every counselor's nightmares. So that, the, the client is disclosing not just something which has happened in the past which might be challenging enough, but this is a situation which is, is ongoing. And again, you might be tempted to dismiss this and say, well, of course this, this, uh, is something which is very unlikely. It's, um, probably could never happen. I think after Harold Shipman, that we, we do need to be fully aware that it can happen, it's possible that it may arise within a counseling context, we have other similar cases, uh, the case of, uh, Amanda Jenkinson, of Beverley Allitt, where nursing professionals have been involved in carrying out, um, actions which led to, to damage or even death of, of very vulnerable patients. So it is a realistic scenario, and in fact, it is a real-life scenario, surprisingly. 

00:47:25
MIKE SIMMONS Really? 

00:47:25
PETER JENKINS Yes. This is from, I came across this in the autobiography of R. D. Laing who was a psychiatrist who worked in the 1960s and 1970s. So he talks about this, um, quite obliquely, as something which another therapist confided to him. What he doesn't say is how he responded or what action was taken, if any, about this very serious situation. But I think we have to take it face value that, um, it's something which may well have happened and, and could happen. Again, in very narrow legal terms, the immediate starting point would be perhaps an assumption that there is, uh, a legal requirement on the counselor to, to terminate the therapy and to report this immediately to the authorities. Now, that might be the appropriate thing to do in ethical terms, in professional terms, however, and again, this may come as, as something of a, as a surprise, that there's no legal obligation on citizens in England and Wales to report crime, even serious crime. There are, I'll say this very quickly, there are one or two exceptions to this. What we have is a situation where the individual citizen, whether they're a counselor or whether, whether not, they have a right to report it, so they could report it, and again, we come back to this phrase, "in the public interest." So for the good of society, one would assume that it would be in the public interest for the counselor, if necessary, to break confidentiality and to report this to the authorities for them to take action, but there's no strict legal obligation on them to do so. 

00:49:20
MIKE SIMMONS So, can I just check with you, you said no, uh, obligation to report crime. Is this crime that has taken place or is going to take place or both? 

00:49:30
PETER JENKINS Well, this covers all crime, in the sense that there is historic crime, so it's not unknown for clients to admit to very serious incidents and perhaps to, to manslaughter in the past, um, to child abuse, uh, to a whole range of different, uh, criminal activities in the past. There's no obligation on the counselor as a system to report these. Again, they could choose to do so in the public interest. And of course, the question that you raised earlier, similarly as with a suicidal client, one might take that action as a good citizen, the question then would be, well, what is the impact upon the therapeutic alliance or perhaps the reputation of the agency in which you're, you're working. Again, it may be that this is criminal activity which the client is currently involved in or prospective activity, so it's something they plan to do. And again, there's no obligation, as I understand it, in narrow legal terms, for the counselor to take action. They have a choice. They have a moral choice. Uh, maybe that choice is circumscribed by the agency in which they work. So, for example, if the client is working in a prison setting, it may well be as part of their, their contract of employment or the protocols for providing counseling in a custodial setting that if a prisoner discloses criminal activity, which might be historic, uh, it might be current, may be prospective, then they would be duty-bound to, to report that. Again, that would be to do with their conditions of employment, rather than strictly speaking compliance with the law as such. That may seem very fine distinction, but I think it's in those spaces that we have to look for, well, what are the prospects maintaining confidentiality. So they, they are partly dependent upon context. 

00:51:35
MIKE SIMMONS So what I'm getting a sense of here is that it's much more around an ethical responsibility than a legal responsibility. 

00:51:40
PETER JENKINS I think so, and I do find that many people are shocked and probably disbelieving when I say that there isn't this overriding legal obligation to report crime. There are exceptions to this which I, I actually must add hastily, so that, for example, for, uh, our colleagues in Northern Ireland, then under the Criminal Law of 1967 which, um, relates to anti-terrorist legislation, then any criminal activity must be reported by any citizen. Now, that would apply also to counselors in, in Northern Ireland. But for the vast majority of counselors in the rest of the UK, there isn't this legal obligation, so it then comes back to a moral choice. And I suppose immediately, the view might well be, well, surely if someone is disclosing that they're carrying out this kind of activity, so you have an anesthetist who is, um, actually interfering with medical operations, but it's very hard to detect, we only have their word for it, then we, we have a, a moral obligation to, to intervene here. There is a counterargument which may not be that popular, and certainly there are writers from a psychoanalytic perspective, I'm thinking of Christopher Bollas, who's written a lot about confidentiality in the States and in the UK, and his argument would be that even in this very stark situation, it's still not, may, may not necessarily be the right thing for the therapist to report. How does the therapist know that this is true? 

00:53:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, of course. 

00:53:30
PETER JENKINS It could be a fantasy. It could be that the client is choosing to wind up their counselor, that this is something that they want to play some kind of grandiose game, uh, that they really want to spook their, their therapist. So, I think Christopher Bollas' argument would be that the therapist would work with this material, it may be a murderous fantasy, but, I mean, to work with it as fantasy, that to, to report it would be an irreparable breach of the therapeutic alliance, that would be the end of that, that work with that client. I think other therapists might take the view, well, so be it, that as therapists, we're not police officers, we're not detectives, that we take what the client says at face value, and even if it was a murderous fantasy, surely this should be investigated by the authorities and that's not something that we can prejudge. 

00:54:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, let me just take you back a moment or two. This may be an example of the circles I move in more than anything else, but in conversations I have on a number of occasions heard that the exceptions to breaches of confidentiality or the exceptions to maintaining confidentiality, are actually child abuse, terrorism, and money laundering. Now, I've heard this a number of times, and it feels like you're maybe saying that's not true. 

00:54:55
PETER JENKINS Well, that is the received wisdom, and I would take issue the first of these. I mean, the, in terms of reporting child abuse, that's something we'll look at in a separate scenario, and again, not to understate or minimize the, the issues that are involved there, the, the legal situation I think is fairly straightforward, but it's not as perhaps has been presented to you. English law is really quite flexible, when I say "English law," applying obviously to, to Wales as well, and the same principles applying in Scotland, that there is, if you like, a great deal of latitude that citizens are left in many cases to decide to take action, and there, there isn't a set of mandatory reporting requirements on therapists, for example, that we find in the States. The, the two exceptions to reporting where there is mandatory reporting, that is, the citizen, the counselor, must report and they have no choice, are, as you say, the first of these is terrorism. So the, under the Terrorism Act 2000, if any citizen, if a counselor has information about terrorist activity, then they must report it immediately to the authorities. Now, interestingly, the definition of terrorism is quite broad, and it's quite elastic, and critics of the terrorism legislation have pointed out that it has been used in the past to, um, to arrest protestors at anti-arms fair demonstrations and so on, so it, it could be applied against animal rights protesters. Uh, it, it it's a fairly broad and elastic definition which I think is worrying to some, uh, libertarians. However, if we have information about terrorist activity, then there is no choice; you must report it. Curiously, you must not inform the client that you're doing so. If you inform the client that you are reporting them, then you could be subject to an additional criminal charge of tipping off the individual, and again, there, there, individuals have been, uh, convicted, and the penalty is 14 years' imprisonment. So these are very draconian, very serious charges. You might think that, again, this is entirely hypothetical, but we do know that for some therapists working, perhaps in some contexts, working, again, not to stereotype any particular group, with particular parts of the population, then terrorist activity is not simply a hypothetical possibility. It has come up in counseling sessions, and, uh, therapists have been faced with the need to report it immediately to the authorities. So that's, that's the one major exception. The other is slightly more complex. I mean, it is, as you say, it's to do with drug money laundering, and this is from the Drug Trafficking Offenses Act of, uh, 1994, and under this, very similar provisions, that if you have information about drug money laundering, that is where money obtained from illicit sale or production of drugs is then laundered or passed through banks in order to emerge as legitimate money. If you have information about this, then you must report it, you must not tell the client. Now, it may well be that some counselors have come across this. I don't have any direct or indirect experience. I've never heard of a counselor in this situation. Maybe if you were counseling Tony Soprano, then that, that might be a relevant consideration. Um, this is an act which is really for the registered financial sector. So it's for bankers, accountants, and financiers. Um, it's relevance to counselors, again, seems to be, unlike the Terrorism Act, to be more hypothetical in nature. It does have teeth. I mean, there, there was a case of one solicitor who was sent to jail for four months for failing to report, um, drug money laundering. So, but its relevance to counseling seems to be much more limited. 

00:59:05
MIKE SIMMONS I'm interested in this idea of tipping off the client because, uh, I've a lot of experience of training counselors, talking in terms of their contract with a client, and actually saying, "If I were to need to break this confidentiality, I would inform you first." And you're saying this is exactly the opposite to what they should do. 

00:59:30
PETER JENKINS Well, it's, it's a rare but significant exception. And, uh, and so I think trainee counselors, any counselors need to be aware of how they contract with clients and what the wording of that would be. I, I guess that, I mean, usually the form of words, "Well, if you were at risk of harm or if someone else was at risk of harm," and that covers a multitude of, of situations, but it would be as well to back that up with some, a printed protocol from the agency or, if in private practice, that you have set up, which perhaps goes into more detail of what exceptions to confidentiality there, there may well be. So, but we have a situation where this particular client appears to be confessing to multiple murder, um, and the counselor has a choice, rather than an obligation, to report it. Legitimately, they could break confidentiality and report it in the public interest. There is one other situation which probably does have some relevance which would be in the case of employee counseling, so if we were to assume that the counselor was a staff counselor in an NHS trust, for example, and the anesthetist is bringing this, perhaps real, perhaps imaginary, situation, then, as a form of whistle-blowing, then the therapist could report that within the agency, and that they would be protected from, for example, the usual results of whistle-blowing which are to be disbelieved or sanctioned or, in some cases, people have lost their jobs through whistle-blowing. This, this is the Public Interest Disclosure Act of, uh, 1998. And under this act, then the, the therapist in that position, so a, a staff counselor would be protected from any kind of untoward, um, consequences, assuming that they did it in good faith, so they're not doing it maliciously, they're doing it on the basis that they have this information and that they are taking appropriate action. That begs the question of what might you do if you were not in that situation, and I guess the, the legal defenses for breaking confidentiality, firstly, it's in the public interest, and in some cases, you could make use of what is known as qualified privilege, so you have information about fraud or misconduct by an individual and you are contacting, in this case, the GMC or the appropriate professional body for them to, to take action. 

01:02:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Should we move on to the next scenario? 

01:02:10
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN I'm currently counseling a 14-year-old boy for anxiety problems. Um, his parents are alcoholics, and they're demanding now that they be kept informed of the nature of what's going on in our sessions or they'll end the counseling. 

01:02:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, another tricky situation here. 

01:02:30
PETER JENKINS Well, yes, um, we seem to be looking at a lot of potential conflict situations here. So I guess the identifiable conflict is between the wishes of the young person, the 14-year-old, and parents who perhaps found out about the counseling and now want to be, um, more fully involved or have information about what the nature of the, the counseling material is. From a legal point of view, it really raises the question directly of what are the rights of children and young people to counseling confidentiality? I think in a, a previous scenario, I mentioned that the law has pretty strong protection for confidentiality. It does take confidentiality very seriously and we can benefit from that in terms of buttressing the, the work that we do as therapists. Now, the law relates directly, of course, to confidentiality for adults, and the question is, well, what about people who are not adults, who are under 18? The position is that for young people aged 16 to 17, then the expectation is that they will have the same entitlement to confidentiality as would an adult. What was unclear within the law up until the mid-1980s was what about the under-16s? So as children and young people, they are clearly dependants of their parents, and does that mean that parents have a right to, to know, for example, what they take to counseling or do they have to give permission for them to go to counseling? And this was tested in the Gillick case, uh, and the Gillick case is really a crucial piece of case law. There isn't a great deal of case law in English law that relates so directly to therapy, but you may remember that the case was that Victoria Gillick had five daughters under the age of 16, and her concern was, was that if any of her daughters went to see the local GP for advice on contraception, perhaps to go on the pill, that the, the doctor first of all would refuse to see them because they were under the age of 16, therefore they, uh, were under the age of consent, they were not legally able to consent to having sex, for example, and secondly that the doctor would immediately contact her as the parent, that it was her right to know. Local authority, the health authority, refused to give that, uh, agreement, and Victoria Gillick took them to court, and she, she lost, she appealed and went to the court of appeal, and the court of appeal went to the House of Lords which was then the highest level of the English legal system. And by a margin of three lords to two, it was decided against her. That is, that the, the judgment was in the Gillick case that a young person under the age of 16, and the age is important here because this was, um, a watershed where it was unclear what, what, what is the position of the under-16s. A young person under the age of 16 can see a health practitioner for confidential medical treatment, that is, that the parents do not need to be informed and they do not need to give their consent for that treatment. The, the rider is that the health professional needs to be convinced the young person has sufficient understanding, and that begs a number of questions. Well, what is this mysterious quality of sufficient understanding? And it's really to have almost a, an adult's understanding of the issues. So if, for example, a young person is going for sexual health advice or contraceptive treatment, then do they understand the, the health consequences of perhaps having sex under the age of 16, do they understand the consequences of going on the pill, that there are implications for their health and, and so on, and they need to be able to, to weigh this up and to, uh, to make a reasoned choice. So almost in the same sense that an adult would do this. And it's up to the health, health professional to make this, this decision that they, they have this capacity to, to make a reasoned decision. Now, the Gillick decision was crucial because not only did it open the door to confidential medical treatment, access to sexual health treatment and contraceptive advice and so on to young people, but also it really opened the door to confidential counseling for young people under the age of 16. Children's Legal Center followed the case very carefully, and their argument was that if it was the case that a young person under 16 of sufficient understanding could have a confidential medical consultation, then the same must surely apply to them seeking counseling, because the quality of confidentiality is the same in both relationships. So Gillick really has opened the door to child-centered counseling and I think provides the basis for most counseling in voluntary agencies, um, certainly to be very influential within the, uh, Mental Health Act code of practice for young people in psychiatric care and so on. But it does, again, it doesn't answer every question, and the immediate question for most practitioners is, well, what is the lower age for what is called Gillick competence. Gillick competence is not a term I'm, I, I'm very comfortable with for a number of reasons, but at what age does Gillick not apply? And social services guidance tends to point to 13. Um, I think there is, it's a moot point. I mean, the whole point about Gillick is of course that the young person's entitlement is not age-dependent. It depends upon their level of maturity and almost their kind of intellectual and relational capacity to understand what they're asking for, the consequences and implications of, um, either contraception or confidential counseling or whatever. So Gillick has a direct relevance to this particular scenario in that the young person, the under-14, assuming that they are judged by the counselor to have sufficient understanding, that the counselor could take the young person to be the client, and they could quite simply say, "Well, I, I'm, I'm not inclined to, to report on the detailed content of this." Um, in some scenarios it might be they don't even acknowledge the young person as receiving counseling, that in itself might be a breach of, of confidentiality. There is, I suppose, a, a different scenario. Perhaps if the parents are paying for the counseling, then they might insist on it, and if the counselor doesn't comply, they could simply say, "Well, in that case, we're not gonna pay for any more counseling, thank you very much," and that counseling would come to an end. And I guess in that situation, the young person would then perhaps have to look for access to other forms of counseling, maybe through ChildLine or agencies that work with children and young people in, in that locality. So it's a conflict of issues, but strictly speaking, parents do not have what I guess many of us fondly imagine that we possess, parental rights to know about our children and young people going into counseling. 

01:10:25
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess a lot of parents would be quite uncomfortable to hear that. 

01:10:30
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. I mean, as a parent myself, I mean, I, I, I, I, I do sympathize with that view, but the law has been established, and so, 1985 it's been around, it's a very significant piece of case law. It was challenged quite directly by, um, an applicant called Sue Axon. I mean, you may remember that in the Brunts School in Mansfield, I think it was 2003, there was a girl at the school, she became pregnant, she went to see the school nurse and the school nurse arranged termination. She then went home and informed her mother what had happened, and the mother, understandably, was very aggrieved, very upset, and very angry. She contacted the school. She also contacted the Daily Mail, and it became a huge media publicity incident. And the issues that were raised there were very much that surely, as a parent, she had a right to know as a mother that, um, who else was going to help the daughter through this potentially traumatic process, um, and if, how could a parent do that if they were simply unaware of what had happened? Now, following that, Sue Axon brought a legal review, a judicial review of the Gillick case, and 'cuz the Gillick case really has two point to it. One, one is that a young person has the right to consent to medical treatment, the other is that they have a right to confidentiality. Now, Sue Axon wasn't seeking to challenge both; her argument was that she wasn't seeking to challenge the right of a young person under 16 to consent, in this case to a termination, or to medical treatment, but she was challenging confidentiality, that her argument was that as a parent, she had a right to know. So a young person could choose or not choose to have a termination, but the parent would know, they, they would be informed by the, the medical practitioner. And this went to the, the courts. It was decided, um, it was looked at very carefully by the senior judge, and in the end, it was rejected. And the grounds were very interesting because the judge I think was sympathetic and obviously considered very carefully the parent's view, but the argument that the judge came back with was that if you remove confidentiality so the parent has to be informed, then you change the context for the young person's decision. So it could be the young person wants a termination, and the parent doesn't or the young person doesn't want a termination and the parent does. So by the parent knowing and having that right to be informed, the pressure that could be placed on the young person could reach a different conclusion. So in a sense what the, the judge was saying I think very clearly, was that confidentiality is a necessary precondition for the young person to exercise consent. So you need both elements in place. 

01:13:35
MIKE SIMMONS I'm just thinking that it's something about the child's ability to understand the issues, that's the key thing. Is there then some, is the therapist then beholden on being able to prove how they were able to determine that? 

01:13:50
PETER JENKINS It's a very interesting question. Um, because the, the Gillick case, although it does open the door to a child-centered form of counseling, then there is this question, well, how does the counselor, how does the counseling agency, how do they decide that this particular young person has sufficient understanding? So what agencies can't do is to say on the basis of Gillick, we offer confidential counseling to every person under 16, regardless of their circumstances. Now, in the Gillick case, one of the judges, Lord Fraser, brought out a set of guidelines, and these are known as the Fraser Guidelines, and originally, they were intended to advise medical practitioners in terms of how to handle this kind of situation where a young person was wanting confidential medical advise without parental knowledge or involvement. And the Fraser Guidelines, first of all, they set out that the medical practitioner should try and persuade the young person to involve their parents, but if they refuse, then there are a number of other conditions which the medical practitioner can take into consideration. So, does the welfare oft the young person require the practitioner to agree to the medical treatment, uh, would they be at risk if that, that agreement was withheld, and the Fraser Guidelines really give some kind of framework, I think, to medical practitioners. We don't have anything equivalent for counselors. What I've done in some of my writing is to look at trying to produce, uh, a counseling version of the Fraser Guidelines. Has absolutely no legal standing whatsoever, but they're the kind of questions that a, a therapist might want to think about in terms of, well, what is the level of risk for this young person, what other forms of support are in this young person's life besides myself as a counselor, uh, are there any legal constraints on confidentiality, is the young person, for example, um, in care of local authority or in a care, or whatever. So it's a set of hopefully, um, reasonable principles that an agency might want to look at. But as far as I'm aware, this, the process of offering Gillick-based confidential counseling is very rarely challenged. Of course, that may change. Um, so in this particular case, the, the counselor would be within their rights to, to decline to, to give information unless perhaps the young person gave their consent, and that might be one, one approach. It is interesting that within the school setting, a lot of schools seem to operate outside of the Gillick framework. So that research that I've been involved in looking at schools counseling and of course, we have, um, 100% of, of secondary schools in Wales now provide counseling, about 80% within, uh, England, and it's a very important resource for young people to access counseling. Now a lot of schools seem to offer it on the basis that they need to get parental consent for young people under 16 to access the counseling service. This, to my mind, flies in the face of Gillick. It's not consistent with the, the rights of the young person under established case law, case law, furthermore that has been challenged and, and tested and proven in the, the Axon case, and the result of the Axon case, as we know, is that the judge said, "Gillick remains good law." So it's not a maverick decision, it's something that schools really 

01:17:25
MIKE SIMMONS It's been strengthened. 

01:17:30
PETER JENKINS It's been strengthened, if anything. The principles, uh, are very clear that young people have developing capacities which the, the law ought to recognize which are not necessarily age-dependent, and that, uh, so to my view, schools which operate on the basis that young people under 16, if they wish to access confidential counseling in the school setting, they must produce evidence of parental consent or at least, um, parents have to opt out, there seems to be a conflict there within the, with the rights of the child. 

01:18:05
MIKE SIMMONS Very interesting. Shall we move on to the next scenario? 

01:18:10
UNKNOWN A female client of mine recently told me in confidence that she feels guilty that the person she's living with may be abusing her daughter who's 5 years old, but she's really frightened of challenging about this. She's got no definite proof of the abuse, but she's really worried about his reaction. 

01:18:30
MIKE SIMMONS So this is a scenario you were alluding to earlier on. What are the issues here? 

01:18:35
PETER JENKINS Well, extremely important issues, too, from an ethical point of view, therapeutic point of view, um, so we, we have a client who is expressing concerns which a therapist needs to take very seriously and to try to get a sense of what is the level of risk to, to the child, what, maybe the level of risk to the client 'cuz we know that domestic violence and, and child abuse often go hand in hand, so it could well be that it's not simply the child who's at risk here. If we look at it from a more narrowly legal point of view, then again, I think the working assumption for probably most therapists, most agencies, is that it is the law that you must report child abuse. Well, that isn't quite strictly accurate, that we have a situation in the UK with perhaps the exception of Northern Ireland where the onus is not on the individual citizen, or counselor, in this particular case, to report. Again, it could be that they decide to report in the public interest, and clearly, it's in the public interest to protect children from harm, and even if this was not an accurate report by the client, it may be that, um, they're wishing in some way to get back at a partner or that, um, that, that there's a context here that you, you can't begin to understand at this stage, but if it turns out the report is unfounded, that if the report by the therapist to the authorities was made in good faith, then, you know, that would be the, the defense, that they reported it in the public interest. However, from, as I say, a very narrowly legal point of view, the onus is not on the individual citizen to report. The, the duty is actually on the local authority to investigate. And under Section 47 of the Children Act 1998, the duty is on the local authority to investigate situations where a child is either suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm, and significant harm is a key phrase in the wording of the act. So it could either be physical harm, such as neglect, or it could be psychological harm in terms of emotional abuse, scapegoating, and so on. So the duty is really quite narrowly on children's social care or children's services to investigate and to follow up this, this kind of report. And a social worker, if I was wearing my previous hat as a, a social worker, uh, my approach might well be that if the therapist doesn't report, then the potential abuse can't be investigated. So there is a professional obligation on the therapist to report, if not a narrowly legal one. And now, it is interesting that in America there is mandatory reporting of child abuse where therapists who fail to report do put themselves at risk of legal action. There was discussion in England in the review of child care law in the 1980s in the run-up to the 1989 Children Act as to whether or not there should be mandatory child abuse reporting in this country. And for various reasons, it was decided not to go down that road. It is interesting if you look at the American situation that they, they do have mandatory reporting and it covers everyone who has any involvement with children, so it's, uh, school janitors through to child psychologists. What you tend to get is a massive over-reporting of abuse, so the investigative agencies, the child protection agencies in the States are absolutely deluged with reports, some of which are accurate and well-founded and some of which are not. 

01:22:45
MIKE SIMMONS Because people are kind of keeping on the safe side by reporting if there's a possibility. 

01:22:50
PETER JENKINS Presumably so. I mean, there, there is research to show that there, there is quite a high percentage of, uh, unfounded reports, and this occupies a great deal of time on the part of the child protection agencies. Now, I mean, you might say, well, that's not a credible argument for not having mandatory reporting, but, as I say, it was quite carefully looked at in the review of child care law and decided not to go down that road in 1985. Some would argue that the Children Act 2004 brought in a requirement for reporting, and again, strictly speaking, that is still not the case, that certainly, I think the professional culture has changed significantly, that with the Victoria Climbié case, with the more recent case of Baby P, that therapists who work with children or work with families are under enormous pressure to report child abuse. Now, that is still not a formal, legal requirement, but it may well be that it is an expectation, it's a requirement of their contract of employment. So, for example, the social worker in the Victoria Climbié case was disciplined, and in fact she was sacked for failing to, to follow the necessary child protection protocols at that stage. And it may well be as a therapist in this particular case, if the therapist for whatever reason decided not to report to the social services and it came to the attention of their own agency, that that agency might then decide to, to discipline or to sanction the therapist for failing to report the abuse. But again, that is to do with their contract of employment, and, rather than breach of the law. And you might say, well, that's, if you lose your job, that's a very fine distinction, and I think it's in exactly those kinds of distinctions that we find the space to operate confidentiality with clients. Again, I, I think at this point a lot of, um, viewers might be very curious about on what possible grounds would a therapist not want to report abuse? And I think we have to look quite carefully at what those reasons might well be. It could be, for example, in this case that working with the, the parent who seems unsure about, uh, the, the nature of the abuse, the extent of abuse, whether there, there is abuse going on, that the therapist might report against the client's wishes, and of course, one outcome may be that the therapist then, um, no longer has a client because the client withdraws from therapy, that the report is investigated, and the parent for whatever reason does not cooperate so that investigation, without information, without evidence, runs into the sand, it can't proceed and it's very difficult to make those kinds of inquiries without cooperation from parents. Um, and so an alternative might be for the therapist to, to try to work with the parent, ideally for them to make their own report or to support them in reporting the situation to the authorities, that if there is that kind of cooperative report made, then hopefully that has a more positive outcome. Another scenario might be that the therapist is working with a young person and the young person themselves disclose abuse. Now, as we looked at in another scenario, then the young person ahs a right to confidentiality under, um, Gillick case law, and it could be the situation, young person is saying well, yes, I have been abused in the past, I haven't been abused for four or five years, I don't want it to be reported, um, maybe they're concerned that the alleged abuser would be sent to jail or the family broken up or the young person taken into care, which may be fantasies, but they may have some impact on the young person's decision. And again, the therapist, I think, has a very similar dilemma. So on the one hand, is the risk of the abuse sufficiently severe that a report must be made against the young person's wishes? However, if they report against the client's wishes, do they run the risk of breaking the therapeutic alliance so the young person withdraws from the therapy, um, perhaps denies the abuse, and is left in a more exposed and vulnerable situation than they were before? So the therapist is in a very difficult position here, I think. And perhaps in the vast majority of situations, it would be appropriate to report, but I think you have to be mindful of the impact on the therapeutic alliance, and I think to be very clear that this is not a formal legal requirement, it's a choice that you are making and it may be the correct choice. Um, it may be a formal requirement of your employer to, to, uh, abide by the child abuse reporting protocols, but at the end of the day, it may have untoward impact on, on the therapy itself. 

01:28:25
MIKE SIMMONS I remember you talking a little about this, uh, on another program we made, A Confidential Space, and I remember being in the control room then, being kind of shocked to hear where the law stood. Uh, and, and it seems like you're kind of taking this deeper, the responsibility almost entirely rests within agencies, within codes of practice, within particular settings, not the law itself. 

01:28:55
PETER JENKINS I think we have to make a distinction between the, the substantive law and, as I say, this would be the Children Act 1989. Now, if you, as a therapist, were working in a statutory setting, then it would be a very clear expectation, um, within your, your contract of employment that you must report child abuse. You, you don't have discretion would be the message. And the reference point would be the document Working Together. Working Together is, if you like, the hands-on operation manual for professionals working, whether they're working in day nurseries or hospitals, schools, and the document sets that very clearly that if you, if you have concerns about child abuse, then you contact, in a school, it would be the designated person, and they in turn would contact children's social care, they would investigate, there's a timetable set down which is very prescriptive in terms of investigating the abuse and reporting back and taking action and so on. So working in the statutory sector, you would be bound by the terms of Working Together, and, uh, if you failed to follow that, then you put your own employment at risk. You work in the voluntary sector, a lot of agencies now formally subscribe to Working Together, and often that is tied to funding, so it may be that they, perhaps their practice and tradition errs on the side of working with the young person, perhaps, making the disclosure and trying to work with the to empower them. So it may be a case of the therapist not reporting, not reporting at all, but not reporting yet to work with that material and to build towards a report to the authorities rather than it being, if you like, a kind of, um, sort of, uh, I won't say an needed response, but an immediate response to 

01:30:55
MIKE SIMMONS Well, a response around which there's no choice. 

01:30:55
PETER JENKINS Absolutely, yes. In private practice, the scenario's different again in that the, the private practitioner could make their own choice in the sense that they can make up their own policy. They could subscribe to Working Together, in which case they would contact the authorities and make their report. On the other hand, they might decide that this is historic abuse, that it happened a long time ago, that the child is not at immediate risk, and decide not to, to report it. But again, I think our colleagues in private practice are in a more exposed position in terms of making up their own, uh, policy, in a sense. 

01:31:35
MIKE SIMMONS Because the thing about policy is someone has thought it in advance, maybe based on previous experiences, they thought through in advance, "Well, what should we do if this happens?" in the sort of cold light of day without the pressure of an incident whereas that therapist working in private practice is confronted with it here and now. "What on earth should I do? What is the correct thing to do?" 

01:31:55
PETER JENKINS And I, I guess, in professional terms, there would be issues about, well, where does the private practitioner, if they're a lone practitioner, where do they get their support from, where do they get their advice from, who can act as the consultant to them in sounding out, "Well, I have these concerns, but on the, I'm I'm worried that if I were to report against the client's wishes, whether it's a child or an adult, that this might be the end of the therapy," and I don't mean it in a purely mercenary sense, but in terms of, uh, a breach in the therapy not being helpful to the client at, at that particular point. So a lot of issues for the, the therapist to, to consider here, but I guess what we have is a situation where practice and policy seem to be in advance of the law. I mean, that might, that might sound slightly strange, but, uh, since 1989, we have, the bare bones is that it's the duty of the local authority to investigate. They would say, "Well, we can't investigate unless people make reports." And it's interesting from about 2003 that the, the then Department of Health were issuing guidance, um, to professionals across a broad range of helping agencies, and it was in the form of a document called "What to Do If You're Worried that a Child Is Being Abused," and essentially the answer is "report it." But it is interesting within the guidance, they refer to the practitioner, and I guess what I'm trying to tease out and convey is, is the practitioner a health visitor, a general practitioner, uh, are they a schoolteacher, in which case, their responsibilities might be very tightly drawn. If it's a therapist, I guess you are also a practitioner, but then we might want to distinguish between a therapist working directly for children's social care or working in a health setting, working in the school, working in private practice, and the different context might begin to operate different possibilities for, not placing children at risk, obviously. I, I wouldn't, uh, want to come across in any way as, as supporting that option, but maybe for working with a high level of risk within a confidential space. And I guess the, for the therapist then is that really critical decision-making; um, at what point do I have to make the decision to report against the client's wishes at the risk of breaking the therapeutic frame. 

01:34:35
MIKE SIMMONS And that's the key thing, isn't it? At that moment, the therapeutic relationship is severely damaged, so that support is now cut off for the client. If we were to go back to what you were saying at the beginning of this program, that we would provide some kind of direction, some kind of sense for people about where else they might look for information for support and so forth, and one of the things I've gotten a sense of is that the person working in private practice is most likely to need that support because they haven't got a whole code of practice, a whole network to work with. But what are other sort of places that people should look? 

01:35:10
PETER JENKINS Well, going back to the opening statements and discussion, the beginning of the, the tape, that certainly being faced with legal issues and legal dilemmas is something which is anxiety-provoking, I think for any practitioner, now, if somebody's working within an agency, then it may well be that other practitioners have faced similar experiences before so that there is, if you like, a, an organizational memory within the organization, that someone has dealt with before, that there is a protocol, there is guidance, there is expertise available. As therapists, we are required to have, to take part in supervision, and we would look to a supervisor as being a, a first line of, of, um, information. I guess my concern is that sometimes supervisors are perhaps not as fully informed about legal issues as we might like them to be. And it could be that the therapist gets a very emphatic answer, "Well, you must do this, or you must not to that," and it may be more nuanced, it may be more qualified than that. And so supervision is important, but I guess it's also about having access to a menu of different sources of information. Uh, professional associations like BACP and organizations increasingly have access to legal advice in house. So it may be possible to contact BACP or UKCP to get a sounding if you like. Well, what is the legal situation? There are publications available on how to respond to legal dilemmas, books, pamphlets, information sheets, so there is information out there which should cover many of the dilemmas which the average practitioner is, is, is going to face. And again, within the terms of their professional indemnity insurance cover, there will be provision, most likely for access to a telephone help line to speak to a solicitor. Now, again, a caveat to that is that sometimes I think the advice that therapists get tends to be quite broad-brush and not always very finely attuned to the particular concerns of a therapist perhaps working with children or working in this context or working in private practice, so again, it's important to take that legal advice in context and really to, to push for, "Right, well, I'm a counselor, I work in a school, this is my issue," and to get advice which is really well-informed and accurate which is not always so straightforward, I think, as, as one would hope that it would be. 

01:38:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. That sounds like a good place to end. 

01:38:10
PETER JENKINS Thanks very much. Okay. Right.
