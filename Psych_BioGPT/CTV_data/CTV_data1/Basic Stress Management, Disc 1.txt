Directives And Working, As A Counseling/Coach 

00:00:00
Introduction, Mary Bradford Ivey, EdD, NCC, LMHC 

00:00:00
Counseling/coaching 

00:00:00
Listen, instruct, encourage, feedback 

00:01:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Directive Strategies are different. Coaching is a useful term you think about as you work with these final strategies in this series. Your task is to work with clients, to influence them to work with well known specific strategies for change. We call we call this approach 'counseling-coaching.' When we work with Directive Strategies, we explain what is going to happen to the client, explain the potential value of the directive and seek agreement before we move ahead. Always involve the client, that's why we use the word 'coaching.' A good coach listens, then provides instruction, encourages a person to try something new, and gives feedback throughout the process. When we give a directive, whether it is on the importance of exercise and nutrition or whether we are using our well known strategy, such as the automatic thoughts, inventory, or a Gestalt exercise, we always want to work in a coaching style. Both listening and influencing our client throughout. In several of the directive demonstrations, you're going to see what we think needs to be named as counseling-coaching. But, as always, keep the dangers of advice in mind. Advice and giving directions can be self-medication. This is the client's life, not yours. 

00:02:10
Avoid self-medication 

00:02:10
Expect stress among clients 

00:02:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY At this time, it is truly important to remember the importance of empathy. Be with the client, don't self-medicate. Stress is a key in issue in most all counseling and therapy. Virtually, all of our clients come to us with varying levels of stress and tension. Whether it is a career decision, exa...examination anxiety or serious personal issues, stress is likely to be present. Thus, think of the many Directive Strategies as a way of helping clients understand and manage through, of both the stresses of everyday life and more serious crisis. We believe that virtually all counseling and therapy clients are dealing with problematic stress. Neuroscience shows us that stress results in excessive cortisol that can destroy brain cells and harm cognitive development. 

00:03:05
Brain damage comes, from stress and cortisol

00:03:05
Automatic thought 

00:03:05
Psychoeducation 

00:03:05
Other directives 

00:03:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Long term stress can result in physical problems, such as, hypertension and severe emotional issues. Here are directives that can help clients deal with stress and manage decisions in their lives more effectively. Exercise, relaxation and breathing, meditation, guided imagery, thought stopping, free association, Gestalt exercise, automatic thoughts, psycho education and other directives. What is important, is that you have many of the counseling-coaching strategies available for clients, as they need them.

Negative Demonstration, Information/Advice On Exercise, Mary Bradford Ivey, EdD, NCC, LMHC, Demonstration interview with Kent Butler, Ph.D. 

00:04:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Kent, how are you doing today? 

00:04:20
KENT BUTLER I'm doing well, thank you. 

00:04:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good, good. Glad you could stop by. I heard you had some things you wanted to talk to me about? 

00:04:30
KENT BUTLER I, I started to think in my life that I wanted to look at where it was going. I felt like I had so much going on. 

00:04:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm-hm. 

00:04:35
KENT BUTLER Starting to be very overwhelmed with so much that's been happening in my life over the past couple of years. 

00:04:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, what kinds of things are overwhelming right now? 

00:04:40
Multiple stressors 

00:04:45
KENT BUTLER Well, recently I just lost my father...lost my parents within the last couple of years. I took a new position about 2 and a half years ago, where I moved from Missouri, where I worked as a tenured professor. And, I gave up my tenure to move. 

00:05:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm-hm. 

00:05:00
KENT BUTLER I have a home in Missouri that I can't get rid of, in terms of the housing market being where it is. And, uh, and so, that on top of everything else, trying to now re-establish myself as a, a, faculty member at a new place. 

00:05:20
Restatement 

00:05:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY There's a faculty position there and a faculty position here. In a new place, getting all the new orientation stuff. 

00:05:25
KENT BUTLER Right. And, then trying to have a personal life. 

00:05:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, a personal life on top of all that. 

00:05:30
KENT BUTLER On top of all that, and then on top of that students and their demands. 

00:05:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, the students and their demands. Yeah. 

00:05:35
KENT BUTLER So, there's a lot going on. But, you know, what I recommend for people like this, who have a lot going on is you've got to relieve the stress. And, I know you like sports, and I can see your number 22, I think what you need to do is just simply get out and do something everyday. Like for example, I would get out and walk around the block a half an hour, or swim, or, or, uh, play tennis, or, um, go to the gym, you like the gym, go to the gym. Um, get on the treadmill. Just do something everyday. And, then I'd probably practice some deep breathing. You know, if I had that many stressors going on, that's the things that I'd be doing. 

00:06:15
KENT BUTLER Hmm. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:20
What Is Wrong Here, Besides Self-Medication?, 1. Self-medication!, 2. Failure to involve client, 3. Vague information, 4. Presented too quickly, too soon 

00:06:20
Involving The Client, Through, Counseling/Coaching, Exploring stressors, Teaching breathing and exercise 

00:06:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Kent, great to see you again. 

00:06:35
KENT BUTLER Nice to see you, as well. 

00:06:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, I see you've got your, um, number 22. Now, tell me about that. 

00:06:40
KENT BUTLER Well, just Dallas Cowboy pride right now. 

00:06:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, boy! 

00:06:45
KENT BUTLER Just, uh, it's football season... 

00:06:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You had a great weekend? 

00:06:45
KENT BUTLER Yeah, I had a great weekend. 

00:06:45
Relationship building 

00:06:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, that's great. So, what did you want to talk about today? 

00:06:50
KENT BUTLER Well, I've been kind of thinking about some things in my life over the past couple of weeks. 

00:06:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Umm-hmm. 

00:06:55
KENT BUTLER And, I just felt like I needed to sit down and talk with someone about some... just things I feel like I've been overwhelmed with as of recent. I, um, over the past several years I lost both parents and now it's a new role in my life that I have to take on. 

00:07:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Umm-hmm. 

00:07:10
KENT BUTLER And, uh... 

00:07:10
Short paraphrase 

00:07:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, your sort of the head now with... 

00:07:15
KENT BUTLER Well, as the middle child, I'm, I'm, I'm still there. 

00:07:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:07:15
KENT BUTLER Um, it's just a lot, you know, I feel like now, with my nephews and things like that, I have a different role now... 

00:07:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Different responsibility. Yeah. 

00:07:25
KENT BUTLER That my parents once had, in that regards. Uh, I recently, as of 2 and a half years ago, taken a new position. 

00:07:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
KENT BUTLER I left my former position, where I was tenured as a professor, and then decided that I'd give that up and kind of take on a new role at a new university. Uh, a change. 

00:07:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY A change, umm-hmm. 

00:07:45
KENT BUTLER One that I thought at the time was, and still do, that was a very phenominal change for me. 

00:07:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, it was a good move? 

00:07:55
KENT BUTLER And, it moved me to the south. 

00:07:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:07:55
KENT BUTLER And, on the east coast again. So, I was very happy about that. 

00:08:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:08:00
KENT BUTLER I'm very, very happy with that decision. But, the time of that decision came during the housing crunch, and so I still have a home that's still on the market... 

00:08:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, boy. 

00:08:10
KENT BUTLER In Missouri. 

00:08:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:08:10
KENT BUTLER And, uh, so it's been very difficult. I just finally got someone to move in, in a rent to own type of a situation. And so... 

00:08:15
Seeking further data 

00:08:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, you are here in Florida with, um, the 2 homes then? 

00:08:20
KENT BUTLER 2 homes. Well, renting here and paying a mortgage on the other. 

00:08:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Wow. 

00:08:30
KENT BUTLER And so, financially it's just been a...just depleted my, any savings that I could ever have. 

00:08:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Disaster. 

00:08:35
KENT BUTLER And so, everybody in the economy is dealing with that. So, I felt like okay, I just have to my lumps, as well. And then, you know, now being in the Florida area, I'm interested in finding a life partner and that's been difficult. 

00:08:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Finding someone special? 

00:08:50
KENT BUTLER Someone special that I can kind of settle down with and start to raise a family. Uh, and that's been itching at me for quite awhile now. 

00:09:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Umm-hmm. 

00:09:00
KENT BUTLER And, then on top of that, I'm teaching, you know, everyday. And I have students who have a lot of demands on my life. 

00:09:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Wow. 

00:09:05
KENT BUTLER You know, email on top of email, on top of email. With questions, and questions, and questions. So... 

00:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Students will always have demands. 

00:09:15
KENT BUTLER Yes. 

00:09:15
Restatement 

00:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY (inaudible ) 

00:09:18
KENT BUTLER And so, I feel like, you know, that there's a lot going on. I just want to get a handle on it all. 

00:09:20
Eliciting feeling 

00:09:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You're feeling really...you're feeling right now when you talk about that, how are you feeling? 

00:09:25
KENT BUTLER You know, there's a relief just kind of...just saying it. 

00:09:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Saying it. 

00:09:30
KENT BUTLER But, uh, but when I'm normally thinking about it, I'm, I'm feeling like I got a lot of heart palpitations and I'm just nervous, nervous act and feeling in my heart. 

00:09:40
Stress impacts the body 

00:09:40
Summary 

00:09:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, you have a lot to be, I mean, that's a lot on your plate right now. You know, your parents just passed away and 2 homes. You're leaving 1 position, where you're comfortable and then coming to a new position. All the stresses of being a new person in a new faculty. Writing again, and then at the same point trying to establish a new relationship with someone special that might be your life partner. And, on top of that, students who have endless demands, endless emails, endless demand. 

00:10:05
Reflects stress, and feeling overwhelmed 

00:10:05
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, that sounds like a lot of stressors in your life and I can understand you being overwhelmed. 

00:10:10
KENT BUTLER I feel like it's just been too much. 

00:10:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Oh, wow. 

00:10:15
KENT BUTLER It's just a very, very trying time in life. 

00:10:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I can understand. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:25
5 minutes deleted as they explore feelings of stress and, how it impacts the body. The feelings of being tense, frustrated, and being overwhelmed are explored., Let's examine how Mary uses the counseling/coaching, style to discuss exercise as one of many possible, alternatives to deal with this situation., Listen, encourage, instruct, and give feedback. 

00:10:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, 1 other thing I thought might be helpful today, I knew you were going to be talking about stress, and I have...have some sheets and, um, maybe we can focus a little bit about this stress. Because, you're carrying an awful lot of stress. In particular, if you're beginning to feel it in your chest and heart area. 

00:10:50
KENT BUTLER All right. 

00:10:50
Handouts often useful 

00:10:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Let's take a look at what I have...it's a handout, uh, I call this a stress cycle, Kent. 

00:10:55
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:10:55
Stress and body injury 

00:11:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, uh, what happens is, you know, you talk about these issues...and you just got done talking about all the things that were happening to you. And, as you talk about those things and your getting stressed, your body is...your tension...you kind of don't even notice where the tension is. But, you were even able to identify where it was. But, also these damaging chemicals, cortisols that go into your brain, into your body. 

00:11:20
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:11:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY uh, if they continue, you know, we're going to have a lot of health issues. So, we want to sort of get in there and break this cycle. 

00:11:30
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:11:30
Information giving 

00:11:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, how do you do that? Well, you we want to get sort of a stress plan so that we can deal with all those things that you're dealing with. 

00:11:35
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:11:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, you know, there's a variety of ways to do this. But, one of the simple ways is to simply, um, do a deep breathing exercise. So, you start feeling these thoughts coming on, to come in a break those thoughts. Otherwise, they repeat and there's more tension, then more thoughts and so forth. So, you want to just stop and...maybe we can do this right now, it would be good for us. We're going to take a deep breath in. As we take a deep breath in, we say to "relax," you know "relax." And, I almost think of relaxation, and then we take a deep breath out. And, tension out. So, it's relaxation in, and tension out. Wonderful, let's try this about 4 times, eyes closed just like that. Deep breath and hold it, and then exhale all that tension way out. One more nice deep breathe, and feel that relaxation in and relaxed tension out. Tension out. Tension out. So, that's just a very simple breathing exercise Herb Benson talked about that in some of his theories. And, that's a real helpful way, um, to deal with tension. 

00:12:50
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:12:50
Location specific body areas 

00:12:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, you're feeling in...most of your tension usually feels right in your chest area. Is that where you're usually feeling it? 

00:13:00
KENT BUTLER Yeah, if I were to be really honest about it, I would say that's when I really feel like I need to sit down and deal with this, what's going on. 

00:13:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, you need to deal with it, yeah. 

00:13:05
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:13:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, maybe when you start feeling like that you can take a break, a breathing break. 

00:13:15
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:13:15
Coaching summary 

00:13:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Obviously, things like meditation are even better, you know, to do this for a longer period of time. But, sometimes we don't time, so just do it for a short period of time. 

00:13:20
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:13:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Just take a deep breathe... 

00:13:20
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:13:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And get more oxygen in and ready to begin. 

00:13:25
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:30
"Exercise is Medicine" (R. Davis, Past-President, American Medical Association), This is now an issue that we all need, to consider as part of our treatment plans. 

00:13:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, then I wanted to show you Kent, um, you know, the second page here. We're going to talk a little bit about exercise. 

00:13:40
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:13:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You want to turn your page over here, I'll show you what I'm talking about here. 

00:13:45
KENT BUTLER All right. 

00:13:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, I know you're no stranger to exercise, because you're a jock here. But, um, uh, what do you see here on this page here, that sort of stands out to you? As we look at this together. 

00:13:55
KENT BUTLER Probably the high blood pressure. 

00:13:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY The high blood pressure, right. 

00:14:00
KENT BUTLER Um, my, my mom passed with cancer, so that, that strikes me. 

00:14:05
Information giving 

00:14:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That sort of stands out, the high blood pressure and cancer. And, the value of exercise really is in prevention of stress in the heart and brain health and, you know, cancer. Look at all these things, reduce colon cancer 60%, high blood pressure 50%. Those are real important statistics. 

00:14:20
KENT BUTLER Yeah, right. 

00:14:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, you're really carrying a lot of weight, when I listen to all those things, that's, that's...you're pretty into the maxed stress level. You know. So...but, one of the things we can do besides breathing, the most important thing really is exercise. And, so, I'm wondering, um, we've listed here light, moderate and heavy exercise. What, what are your feelings about exercise? I know it seems a little strange to be talking about exercise in a counseling session, but I think when you're dealing with stress this is really important. 

00:14:45
Classic resistance response 

00:14:45
KENT BUTLER Well, it would be nice if I could do it. I mean, I just don't have the time. 

00:14:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Just find time. 

00:14:50
KENT BUTLER I feel like everything that's going on in my life, I just do not have the time to exercise. 

00:14:50
Search for what has worked-in past 

00:14:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. If you had the time, what sorts of things have you done in the past that have been successful? 

00:15:00
KENT BUTLER Well, I like going to the gym. 

00:15:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY To the gym, hm-hmm. 

00:15:00
KENT BUTLER It's like a comradery that goes on in the gym. You meet people, it's like, you know, hanging out and doing stuff. 

00:15:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Great. 

00:15:05
KENT BUTLER When I was in my doctoral program and my master's program, that's all I ever did, really, when I was like feeling like I needed to de-stress. I would go to the gym. 

00:15:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, you've seen it work before? 

00:15:20
KENT BUTLER Yeah, I have seen it work before. But, with my life now, I don't have the time. 

00:15:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, right now it's just crazy? 

00:15:25
KENT BUTLER Right, right. 

00:15:25
Eliciting feeling 

00:15:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But, you have seen how successful it is and how...how did you feel afterwards with exercise? Did you feel pretty, did it help you, ... 

00:15:30
KENT BUTLER I always felt good. 

00:15:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You felt what good? 

00:15:35
KENT BUTLER I felt more energy. More energy. 

00:15:35
Reflecting feelings 

00:15:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, more energy comes to you, you feel better, it gets rid of that stress. And all the things you kind of... 

00:15:40
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:15:40
What works for THIS client? 

00:15:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, I guess what I would say is, um, you know, we can continue talking and we will continue in our sessions, but maybe you'd like to try something to just to relieve some of the stress. Try some exercise? What do you think you could be able to fit into your schedule? I mean, I know how much you have to do. 

00:15:55
KENT BUTLER Right. Well, um, I feel like I don't have time, if I have 25 hours. 

00:16:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY If you had an extra hour... 

00:16:00
KENT BUTLER If I had an extra hour, I might be able to do some workout. But, I, I, I don't have that kind of time. I feel like every time I'm up and about, I'm moving to...deal with the next thing. Yeah, what's next on the to do list, to do. 

00:16:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What do I have to do next, to do, to do, to do. 

00:16:15
Note restatements 

00:16:15
KENT BUTLER And, it's never "go to the gym." It's never "have fun." "Workout." You know, think about yourself. 

00:16:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY There's never a time to put yourself first, even though it's doing these things to your health, you don't think at some point it might be a good idea to try to take some time for you? 

00:16:35
KENT BUTLER I wasn't never correlated going to the gym with that. 

00:16:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY With taking time... 

00:16:35
Client change Scale Level 3 

00:16:35
KENT BUTLER With taking time for myself. It's just that... you know, I've got all these demands and get these demands taken care of. And so, that's basically what I've been doing. 

00:16:45
"We," interactive decision 

00:16:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Do you think that we could try an experiment this week? And, maybe try...like how much would you be willing to try, to see if this would help with, with your stress? How many times a week do you think you could try doing something? 

00:17:00
KENT BUTLER Like, in terms of working out? 

00:17:00
Focus on positives 

00:17:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, in terms of working out, if you like the gym, if that's what you like to do. 

00:17:00
KENT BUTLER Well, 7 days would be great! But, maybe, I don't know, um, I work on Monday and Wednesday. I teach on Monday and Wednesday evenings. And so, it makes it very difficult during that day, because it makes a very long day. But, I, I would like to try to get into the habit of getting up earlier. Which, I don't do. And, maybe that's what I can do on the days I don't teach, is try to get into the habit of waking up early and the first thing I do is go to the gym. A lot of times I just wake up and kind of just lounge around until I have to go do something. Maybe I have to be more exact, I don't know. 

00:17:35
Advice 

00:17:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Just put it on your "to do" list and schedule it. The first thing to do is to do exercise, and then do the other things. 

00:17:40
KENT BUTLER Right. A lot of times I don't do that. I just know, you know, I just know that I have to be at my office by a certain time, so I kind of get there, you know. And, maybe I have to be more exact. 

00:17:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Find a time that would work for you and fit in. 

00:17:55
KENT BUTLER So, I mean, if I were to answer the qeustion perhaps, maybe, 2 maybe 3 times a week. 

00:18:00
Level 3+, Client Change Scale 

00:18:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY All right. 

00:18:00
KENT BUTLER Maybe I teach on Monday and Wednesday, so, maybe Tuesday, Thursday and Friday I can make an attempt to... 

00:18:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY To do it? 

00:18:10
KENT BUTLER To do that? Yeah.

Do we need physician referral? 

00:18:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. Tuesday...you want to do Tuesday, Thursday and Friday or do you want to do one weekend day? Or just Tuesday...do you think that Tuesday, Thursday, Friday would fit your schedule best? You know, before we go, I am concerned about the heart palpitations that you mentioned. Could you tell me, you know, how long that's been happening or when it happens? 

00:18:30
KENT BUTLER Um, probably periodically, throughout the day. I think again, I think I sense that when I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

00:18:35
Reflection of feeling 

00:18:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY When you're feeling overwhelmed. 

00:18:40
KENT BUTLER But, currently, I'm, I'm seeing a doctor... 

00:18:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You have seen a doctor? 

00:18:40
KENT BUTLER About certain things. And, I'm actually taking high blood pressure medication. 

00:18:45
High blood pressure frequent, for African Americans, Often due to stress of racism 

00:18:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, I see. Okay. As you know, high blood pressure occurs probably higher in percentage of African Americans and it's something we need to be aware of and to attend to. And, I do want to know, have you talked to your doctor about your exercise program? It's very important to checkout what your doing with the doctor to make sure that it is okay. 

00:19:10
KENT BUTLER Yeah. I think we discussed it from time to time. Um, he would like me to consider maybe losing some weight and things along those lines. But, again, like I said, I just haven't had the time for working out. 

00:19:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:19:20
KENT BUTLER I don't eat right. And, so, thinking about how I can go about trying to change my dietary habits, and stuff like that, too. 

00:19:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You've got a lot of things you're working on to change. 

00:19:30
KENT BUTLER There's a whole lot of things that I need to do. 

00:19:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY The diet and the exercise. 

00:19:30
KENT BUTLER Right. 

00:19:30
Is weight loss counseling needed? 

00:19:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But, you might want to check in with him just to see and make sure that you're going to go back to the gym, you're going to try a new program now, we're going to really try to get back in shape and you're going to give it the old "college try." 

00:19:40
KENT BUTLER The old "college try." 

00:19:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And, um, see if we can't. Um, but, but make sure that he's okay with what you're doing. But, even with high blood pressure it's even more important when you feel that stress to just take those deep breathes and make sure that gym...going to the gym and exercising is a priority in your life. 

00:20:00
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:20:05

Contracting, For Homework, Will the client take it home and do it? 

00:20:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Can you contract to do this? And, maybe you can even write it down and tell me how it went, how long your exercise. 

00:20:15
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:20:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY How you felt afterwards. Just a little bit of a contract so that we could...and then I want to know how it helped you with the stress and all the things that you're dealing with. And, hopefully that will make a difference and, uh, that you'll feel better and more in control of your life. 

00:20:30
KENT BUTLER Right, right. And, so, you want me to come back next week and tell you what I did? 

00:20:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right, right. 

00:20:35
KENT BUTLER Okay. That probably works best for me, probably, because it makes me be accountable to that. 

00:20:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Anyway, hope we have a really good week and we have a good contract and we'll look forward to seeing you next week. 

00:20:45
KENT BUTLER I'll do my best to not make you upset. 

00:20:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, no! Thanks so much for coming in. 

00:20:50
KENT BUTLER Thank you. I appreciate it. 

00:20:50

6-Step Mindfulness Meditation, Norma Cluckstern Packard, Ed.D., LMHC, Keith Kokseng 

00:21:00
"Mindfulness is being aware of what IS, right now without wishing it were different., enjoying the pleasant without holding on, when it changes (which it will)., being with the unpleasant without fearing, it will always be that way (which it won't).", James Baraz 

00:21:00
Mindful Meditation is a form of stress, relief that leads to the relaxation response., Examples of Mindful Meditation strategies are:, 1. Mindful body scans focusing on immediate body experience, 2. Walking meditation focusing on the "physicality" of each step, 3. Slow mindful eating which focuses on eating slowly, and taking time to enjoy each bite 

00:21:00
Deep breathing is basic to mindfulness and, relaxation., Breathe deeply and slowly from the abdomen., getting as much fresh air as possible in the lungs., retaining it, and very slowly exhaling., When you take deep breaths from the abdomen., you inhale more oxygen and become more relaxed. 

00:21:00
As Keith sits comfortably with his back, to the chair, please join him on his mindful, journey of visiting six regions that often cause, us stress and anxiety., Environment, Physical being, Emotions, Thoughts, Self, Spirituality 

00:22:50
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Uh, Keith, if you recall the last time you were here, we talked about the fact that you feel a lot of stress in school because of the financial situation. Costs are going up and it's sometimes getting in the way of your studying, worrying about that. And, I at that time thought, that rather than talking about that, maybe what we might try to do is some meditation. Uh, that this seems to be able to sometimes, when you are feeling that tension, that you can sort of relax. And so, I'm feeling if you can get that, maybe you can go on dealing with the problem even better, or at least it doesn't become as intense. 

00:23:25
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

00:23:25
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Uh, and so, what I...what I thought I would do is...is, I don't know whether you've ever heard of a meditation called "mindfulness?" 

00:23:35
KEITH KOKSENG Never. 

00:23:35
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Well, there's 2 forms of meditation, at least from my perspective or that I'm knowledgeable of, and 1 is concentration. Where you take a mantra, uh, whether it's...whatever that might be. I think you've heard of mantras, where you take a word...where you just concentrate on that one word and that 1 thought. And, then if you drift away from that thought, you always come back to it. So, it's a concentration on 1 area. There's another form of, uh, meditation, which I think has become fairly popular in this country called mindfulness. Partly because all of us are running around all the time, we don't have time to concentrate. We have just enough time to think about something and we move on. But, sometimes we don't think enough about, or it properly. So, uh, what I'm going to do is, uh, concentrate on, on mindfulness. I used the wrong word. Uh, and, there's been some medical research, as a matter of fact, Dr. Siegel (sp) has some and what she's written about mindfulness and how be able not concen...be able to just sort of take life as it is and then move on. It's actually helpful in terms of your own physical wellbeing, in terms of your interpersonal relationships. So, were going to sort of concentrate on mindfulness. Uh, a characteristic of mindfulness, um, I do mindfulness walking with breathing. Now, I'm wondering, if you are at all familiar about breathing? That's sort of an important part of concentration. 

00:25:05
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah, I have. 

00:25:10
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Okay. Well, let's try some. Before I start putting you through a mindfulness exercise, let's try practicing breathing. 

00:25:15
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

00:25:15
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Initally, if you close your eyes, and now, I have this what they call 3, 5, 7 count. I inhale, 1, 2, 3, I hold, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, exhale, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, inhale, exhale. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:45
Keith practices breathing., We encourage you to practice breathing and, join Keith on his journey., The first part of the journey will be Keith's, ability to remove himself from his environment. 

00:25:45
NORMA CLUCKSTERN You look comfortable now. 

00:26:00
KEITH KOKSENG It works. 

00:26:00
NORMA CLUCKSTERN It works. But, what...and what the feeling is mindfulness is when your mind starts drifting on something, as you drift and your mind is adrift. If you find yourself concentrating, come back with that breathing. And so, what I would like to do today is really work on mindfulness as I see it. Maybe, perhaps, technically Dr. Siegel (sp) might not. But, what's sort of helped me...and I'm going to take you through what I think are like 3, well, there are about 6 or 7 parts what you could be thinking about. And, how you could then breathe and then move on to another part. So, if we close our eyes, sit comfortably and close our eyes, and I'm going to take you on a trip. A mindful trip. In the first place, you see environment. Where we are right now. Can you breathe and think about where we are right now. Don't concentrate on it. Act as a spectator. Think of it as a film. Think of it...not who's here, but how you feel about it and just relax. Inhale, exhale. Think about the environment. And, then when I ask you to open your eyes again, and release yourself. What I'd like to hear from you is were you able to turn off the environment? How, given the environment...were you able to close out the environment? 

00:27:35
KEITH KOKSENG Um, with my eyes closed I kind of...focusing on the breathing more, it, you kind of do shut off like what's around you. Your surroundings. 

00:27:40
NORMA CLUCKSTERN So, you were able to do that, or something? You felt that there was some validity in that con...? 

00:27:50
KEITH KOKSENG There's a lot in common with physical exercise. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:27:55
The next journey is to explore our physical being., Why physical being?, Perhaps because it can become an area of pain., an area of energy, or an area of feeling good. 

00:28:00
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And, this is just 1 place you're going to be in environment. But, I thought I'd take you through a, uh, a few other, uh, environments where you might want to be thinking about how...where you might get caught up in thinking and where you need to mindful. So, one of the things we're going to be begin again, close our eyes and breathe. And, we're going to talk about...we've already talked about environment, but now what about your physical being? Think about your body are there parts that may hurt? Don't concentrate, just let them go. Is there any pain? Or maybe you're feeling a lot of peace. Maybe there isn't pain. Have you been out exercising? Is some area that you hurt, that no longer hurts? And, keep breathing and we'll think about our physical being. We come to peace with our physical being. This is an exercise that's been done with helping people with great pain. So, keep breathing in. And, I'm going to rush you a little bit, because we're trying to experiment different areas. But, have you found any...how is that help? Or have you thought of anything? What was it feeling about...what was it like for you to watch your body? 

00:29:20
KEITH KOKSENG Um, my shoulders were a little tense in the beginning, and then kind of dropped down as I started to breathe more and kind of focus on the areas that...I were more tense, and I just let myself relax. 

00:29:30
NORMA CLUCKSTERN So, as we're going through this, does this make some sense to you? Or, uh... 

00:29:30
KEITH KOKSENG Umm-hmm. 

00:29:30
NORMA CLUCKSTERN All right. You ready to experiment with another area? 

00:29:35
KEITH KOKSENG Sure. 

00:29:35
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And, another piece of activity? 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:40
The next journey is to explore our emotions., Emotions that can make us feel anger, joy, sadness or make us cry or laugh. 

00:29:45
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Well, let's take something like emotions, because that's certainly...could be a lot more stressful. So, if we go back to our breathing. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:00
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And, now I'm going to talk about your emotions. Is is love? Is it energy? Are you happy? Are you sad? Do you feel any fear? Can you go on to something that I haven't said? Are there areas of your emotions that you need to think about, or you would like to think about? But, then you want to just...not hold on to them, not stay with them, go onto other emotions. It's always amazing to find out how many emotions that we have. How often we get stuck in 1 of our emotions. So, breathe some more if you feel that you are focusing on 1 emotion. Love, hate, anger, fear, let it go. Let it go. And, whenever you feel like it, come back and share your emotions with or share whatever else you want with me. 

00:31:00
KEITH KOKSENG Um, there was several emotions actually, 'cause, the more that you talked about it, the more I kind of explored each emotion. And, the more that I breathe, I was just kind of passing along almost just like looking at the emotion, feeling it from a 3rd person perspective almost. Very calming. 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:20
The next journey is to explore our thoughts., Thoughts can cause us to be both depressed, and anxious but they can also make us smile, and be joyful. 

00:31:25
NORMA CLUCKSTERN But, the emotions help with the deal? There something that we all deal with. 

00:31:30
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

00:31:30
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And so, that may be an area where we always want to...when we feel tense. Because it's...or we feel happiness sometimes. 

00:31:35
KEITH KOKSENG Right. 

00:31:35
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Or, we actually hear some good music. Because I often find myself feeling emotional when I hear some certain music, brings back certain emotions. Some of them good, and some of them bad. All right, another area that I think is helpful is our thoughts. How do we think? What do we...how do we reason? Uh, what are way of, particularly I think, thoughts in terms of you becoming a counselor, a therapist someday...are going to be dealing with thoughts, people's thoughts. 

00:32:05
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:32:05
NORMA CLUCKSTERN So let's go...always go back to our breathing and always back to being relaxed. And, then look at thoughts and think about our thoughts. What we have. Are we ever surprised? Do we have good reasons? Are we able? Are we peaceful? Or, do we feel anger? Can we share some of our thoughts? Are they thoughts that are valuable to us? That are helpful to us? Think a little bit more of your thoughts, and rather when I...I'm not going to ask you...let it go, when you feel comfortable and thinking of all that you want to think about, then you open yourself. And, then share with me whatever you want. Whenever you want to share, share. 

00:33:00
KEITH KOKSENG This time, well, when you're talking about the thinking process, um, it kind of allowed me more to see what was stressful. But, at the same time, with the breathing aspect of it, it was more manageable because I wasn't holding on to something. And, I was kind of almost like distracted away from it, but the breathing helped. 

00:33:20
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Did it help? It's interesting what you just said, is that, it was helpful, but more helpful in terms of your being able to mindful when I didn't add... ask you...on your own, you decided "now it's time for me to come..." so, that would be an important part that, uh, that you would choose the moment that you felt it was time for you to join me. 

00:33:40
KEITH KOKSENG And, I think that that was something that was really helpful because, if you're not present and I'm having a stressful time, I can do this on my own. 

00:33:50
NORMA CLUCKSTERN All right. Very good. Okay. That is excellent. Uh, could we try one more? 

00:33:55
KEITH KOKSENG Sure. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:00
The next journey to focus one's self and, the acceptance of self. 

00:34:00
NORMA CLUCKSTERN You know, this one also, I think that I will let you, uh, come out of it when you want. Because, I want to talk about our self and who are we. That might be more...it's time for you to join me. So, close your eyes and focus on yourself. Can you accept yourself as you are? Are there things that you might want to change? Do you have difficulty sometimes with problems accepting? Are we accepted by our professors? Are we...is it only important that we accept ourselves? And the others, we can manage. We have to say come and care for our self. Are we alone? Are we loved? Think about ourselves, because that's the most important thing. And, as we breathe, we concentrate on ourselves. And, I will let you...I will join you in breathing and whenever you're ready, you've thought enough about yourself that you'd like to share, join me. 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:10
NORMA CLUCKSTERN (inaudible ) smile. 

00:35:20
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. It's just, uh, being able to kind of take the time to actually think about, you know, the things that I won't accept about myself. Or, who I am. It's kind of, refreshing. Because, the busy life that I seem to have now, I really don't get to take the time to do it. 

00:35:40
NORMA CLUCKSTERN All right, now, now that's very important, because you do have a busy life. And, I think that which you've hit on is really what mindfulness is, why it's become attractive in this country. Because we are busy. That's our society, whether we like it or not, that's who we are. That's...but, sometimes we need to stop, and say I need to stop. And, and so, this was very important that you've come to that understanding. And, it's just one other aspect of this, and then we can talk a little more. And, that is what some people call eternity. 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:36:15
The last journey is spirituality: a time to, meditate, or time to pray or a time of, contemplation. 

00:36:20
NORMA CLUCKSTERN I think is we see what's going on, eternity's part, which will come to all of us. So, close your eyes and think of eternity. And, interesting enough, one of the things that's very popular now is think of eternity in terms of spirituality. In terms of, not necessary one God. There could be a number of Gods, it could be any kind of thing. But, what...how does spirituality come to all of us? How do we come to peace with ourselves as we live our life? How important is spirituality? And, as you breathe and think about that, is that an important aspect of your life? Will it be helpful in everyday movements that we go through? And, again, when you're ready to share with me, I'd appreciate it. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:25
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Have you thought of spirituality at all? Is that something that's important in your life? 

00:37:25
KEITH KOKSENG It is. And, um, it's almost the aspect for me as prayer it's a time for peace, and acceptance. And, almost like, uh, faith to an extent. 

00:37:35
NORMA CLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:37:40
KEITH KOKSENG For me, it's the ability to kind of like, let go and not have to have this burden. You know, sometimes you just have to have a faith that things will happen the way they need to happen. 

00:37:50
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Well, these are the areas that I picked out, anyone of which I think we encounter in our lives, and so that you have, I guess, a world that you can travel and look at, at times when you're feeling that stress. You might go back, is it stress related to my thoughts? Is it spirituality? Is it self? Whatever it is, and that you take that time to sit back, think of my 3, 5, 7, which you're doing very well. And, uh, use this mindfulness. Um, are there any questions that you'd like to ask me about? Because, pretty much, sort of, I think enough that I have given you, or that I feel we can share right now. If you want, we can come back and do some more next week? But, otherwise, is there anything that you'd like to sort of feel me out, while it's fresh in your mind? 

00:38:40
KEITH KOKSENG No, I think that everything's covered. 

00:38:40
NORMA CLUCKSTERN Okay. Oh, but I have something...homework. I have homework for you. 

00:38:45
KEITH KOKSENG Oh. 

00:38:45
NORMA CLUCKSTERN What I'd like to do, uh, there's quite a bit, and I know you use the internet research...adding my..looking for what I would use handouts, I came across a very interesting one. And, it's called...and it really fits in what we're talking about. But, this mindfulness at the gas station. How could you, you know, pretty irritated, bored, have to wait to pay a lot of money. 

00:39:10
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

00:39:10
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And so, sometimes you just get annoyed. And so, now this is a way now that you can go through the process one by one, looking at a gas station. Looking at it how you get the gas, and when you get frustrated then breathe. I've found that, that was a fun one. I also wanted you, because we talked... I thought it was very important for you, there is the...because this is what I was trying to demonstrate, and I'm sure Dr. Siegel (sp) could do better, but, there's a (inaudible ) mindfulness in the brain. And, I think that, that's something you might enjoy reading. You might actually, at some point, you want to read his book, which I do. And, um, those are the...that's your homework, is to read this. I'm waiting to hear how you make out at the gas station. And, of course, breathe. 

00:39:55
KEITH KOKSENG I'll let you know. 

00:39:55
NORMA CLUCKSTERN And let me know. And, uh, is there anything else? Otherwise, we'll see you next week. 

00:40:00
KEITH KOKSENG All right. I think everythings good. 

00:40:00
NORMA CLUCKSTERN All right, Keith. 

00:40:05
KEITH KOKSENG Thank you.

Introduction to, Mindfulness Meditation For, Individuals And Groups, Allen E. Ivey 

00:40:40
ALLEN E. IVEY One of the greatest things that's happened to me, and to Mary, was when we took a 6 week meditation course the Jon Kabat-Zinn's program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn, as you may know, is the foremost teacher of meditation in the country. An incredible background of research supports what meditation can do for mental health. No longer is meditation on the fringe, it's now a central strategy and technique that every counselor and therapist needs to have to teach their clients. Uh, along this line, another joy of ours was attending a 3 day workshop with Kabat-Zinn, the Dalai Lama and Davidson from the University of Wisconsin. Research shows us clearly that meditation strengthens the cognitive cognition, wellness and mental health, improves blood pressure. Basically, it's a basic model for wellness, which I think we all need to use and learn. In this particular, uh, demonstration I'm going to be...it's going to be different, I'm going to ask you to participate with us. I'm going to ask you to enter meditation. Now, there's 2 ways you can do it. One is you can close your eyes, almost from the moment I ask David to close his eyes, and follow through. The 2nd way you can do it, is to just continue to look and we're going to be throwing some pictures on the screen, and all I ask you do if you see the pictures, you make that choice, you can still have a fairly good meditative experience if you allow yourself to experience these pictures. So, come on, let's work with David and do a demonstration of meditation. Okay?

Please join Allen and David in this, short meditation. Or, if you prefer, you can watch the demonstration, and even meditate on the photographs, that accompany the demonstration. 

00:42:40
Allen E. IveyOkay, David, how do you feel about this? Ever done it? 

00:42:45
David BrumbyNo sir, I have actually not. 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Actually not. Hey, this gives us a good beginning. Generally speaking, David, it is best to, uh, and the camera better be ready for this, is for you to sit up. Sitting with back against the chair with your feet on the floor, works best. And, if this is the first time, I'd better tell you, you've heard a little explanation of why it's good. And, uh, also I want to say we're going to do...here we're going to do a standard kind of Kabat-Zinn, uh, what he calls Mindfulness Meditation. I also want to say, you can...if you want to use this same meditation in a spiritual orientation, you can also use it in a prayerful situation. If you use this in prayer, uh, what you'll often do is take a bible verse, uh, a verse out of the Koran, a verse out of the Torah, or perhaps a Zen, or Hindu saying. And, you focus on that, say it to yourself over and over again and get into deep breathing. So, you can do this same thing...I'm giving kind of a secular, classic and the probably more popular format. By doing it clear, this meditative approach I'm using, works almost equally effectively, perhaps equally effectively in a spiritual orientation, as well. Okay? 

00:44:00
David BrumbyOkay. 

00:44:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But, this time we're going to do a more secular, classic, a more Kabat-Zinn type of orientation. 

00:44:05
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:44:05
ALLEN E. IVEY If Jon Kabat-Zinn were watching me, he would say "oh, my goodness." But, I'm not that far off, I've listened to his tapes now for, believe it or not, over 20 years. 

00:44:15
DAVID BRUMBY Wow. 

00:44:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And, Mary and I try to spend 20 minutes every morning doing this. And, when we do it, guess what? We feel better. 

00:44:25
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:44:25
ALLEN E. IVEY It makes a difference to do this at the front of the day. 

00:44:30
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, when particularly, you get into college, or later on, an adult will get stressed. Also, by the way, this is entering now into schools, even down to elementary children. There's some evidence that it works, that's one of the reasons I've asked you to do it. You haven't done it and experienced it. So, we will...what we do... I asked you to sit back in the chair. I'll say for myself, I can do it sitting, uh, Mary and I have done it both ways, when we do the prayer meditation, we tend to sit. When we do the Kabat-Zinn meditation we tend to like to lie on the floor. Each person has to find what works best for them. 

00:45:10
[sil.] 

00:45:10
The Meditation Starts, Observers: Try experiencing the, meditation rather than just watching, the demonstration 

00:45:15
ALLEN E. IVEY This time we are going to do a sitting Kabat-Zinn, and it works as well. Uh, important now, can you feel the back of your chair against your back? 

00:45:25
DAVID BRUMBY Yes. 

00:45:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. And, uh, your feet flat on the floor. 

00:45:30
DAVID BRUMBY Hmm-hm. 

00:45:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, uh, your hands comfortably in your lap, that's important. And, then what I'm going to do is, uh, ask you to close your eyes. What I'm going to do is pretty much the same thing. 

00:45:40
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I just ask you to follow along with me. But, before we start, this mindfulness sounds like you're thinking of all kinds of things, no. The idea is to clear the mind and focus. 

00:45:55
DAVID BRUMBY On what? 

00:45:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Believe it or not, your breathe. 

00:45:55
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Not a lot. And, just, with your eyes open now, just notice me taking a deep breath. Let it out. Did you notice any bodily feelings that go with that? 

00:46:15
DAVID BRUMBY Peace. 

00:46:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Peace. Okay. That's... 

00:46:15
DAVID BRUMBY Relaxation. 

00:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, peace and relaxation. And, what happens if you do this, like I say, even on a day where we feel really hassled, we try to do at least 10 minutes. But, this may make a difference. And, by the way, if you're at a stop light, and you're feeling like this, the beginning of the meditation. Don't do it whole meditation. But, that'll also too...it becomes almost a style of life. 

00:46:45
DAVID BRUMBY Hmm-hm. 

00:46:45
ALLEN E. IVEY It can make a significant difference. So, uh, let's begin with both you and I closing our eyes. Breath in, breath out. It's always a little touchy, you get different people that breathe at different rates. Breath in, breath out. If you're not fully in sync with me, in, out. I find it helpful to think about the breath going down the back of my chest. In, and out. 

00:47:30
DAVID BRUMBY It feels like I'm trying to hypnotize myself. 

00:47:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I beg your pardon? 

00:47:30
DAVID BRUMBY It feels like I'm trying to hypnotize myself. 

00:47:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh, there is some relationship between this and hypnosis. The distinction is, you're in charge and you're in control. Uh, it's not a hypnotic trance, you're always in control. And, what I'd like you to do, we'll do this now, focus constantly on your breathe, nothing else. If you find your mind wandering off, that's okay. Just notice what you do and go back to the breathe. In, and out. 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:10
FOCUS ON BREATH AGAIN AND AGAIN 

00:48:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Focus on your breath. In, out. It's okay to notice your body. It almost feels like... 

00:48:50
DAVID BRUMBY (inaudible ) 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Your whole body's moving in and out. 

00:48:55
DAVID BRUMBY I'm actually noticing big sleepiness. 

00:49:00
[sil.] 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, David, I'm not going to say anything more. You and I, and the people watching us, I'd like you to join us and just meditatate. Focus on the breathe, in and out. Notice if you go off the topic, move on and come back to the breath. 

00:49:30

Conclusion, Generalizing Meditation To Daily, Life And Personal Practice 

00:56:05
ALLEN E. IVEY David, we've been doing this now for about 5 to 7 minutes, something in there. Just take a moment and notice that feeling of peace. Grab onto it, take a memory. Breath just a couple more times. And, come back into the room. 

00:56:30
[sil.] 

00:56:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Open your eyes when you feel like it. How was that for you? 

00:56:40
DAVID BRUMBY Very nice. 

00:56:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Very nice. 

00:56:40
DAVID BRUMBY Hmm-hm. 

00:56:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Can you tell me what you experienced? 

00:56:45
DAVID BRUMBY Um, it felt like, I was thinking about absolutely nothing. So, it was just that peace and tranquility. 

00:57:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You're being better than Mary and me. We still have to work to get there. So, you got there that quickly? Hey, that's awesome. 

00:57:10
DAVID BRUMBY Thank you. 

00:57:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm impressed. I'm impressed. I don't know how the people out there did with this? I don't know how many of you went through the...this probably 7 minute exercise. That's only beginning. Like I say, 20 minutes a day is what Mary and I try to do. Uh, and I really wanted you to do it, because you had never done this before. You're a high school student, people think meditation is for people over in, you know, over in Nepal, or something like that. This is something all of us can do everyday. And, uh, so, we've seen the classic stuff, can you imagine how you might do this in a spiritual way, with prayer? 

00:57:45
DAVID BRUMBY Well, it would probably help me memorize bible versus. 

00:57:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm-hm. 

00:57:50
DAVID BRUMBY So, I could just say a bible verse over and over again. 

00:57:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm-hm. 

00:57:55
DAVID BRUMBY All that. Or, have like a couple of pair of quotes that I could go over. 

00:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm-hm. 

00:58:00
DAVID BRUMBY So... 

00:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And, it's really a way to pray, that's called "centering prayer." 

00:58:05
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:58:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And, a very important part of centering prayer is just like your breathing. The body...and the thing is, whether you're a spiritual person or not, I think most of agree that the body is the temple of the soul. We've all heard that statement. 

00:58:20
DAVID BRUMBY Okay. 

00:58:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And, we need to care for that soul. We need to care for that body. We need care for that spirit. 

00:58:30
DAVID BRUMBY Hmm-hm. 

00:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, regardless of your spiritual or secular orientation, meditation can make a big difference. Thanks so much. 

00:58:35
DAVID BRUMBY You're welcome. Thank you.

Spiritual Stories and Images, Source of strength and comfort, Kent Butler, Ph.D., Alexis Brumby 

00:59:20
KENT BUTLER Well, Alexis it's good to see you again. So, how's things going this week? 

00:59:20
ALEXIS BRUMBY Pretty well. Pretty well, my family's doing good, so, it's good. 

00:59:25
KENT BUTLER That's good. Anything exciting, anything new? 

00:59:25
ALEXIS BRUMBY Uh, well my parents, um, their having another baby and they just came home from the hospital yesterday. 

00:59:35
KENT BUTLER Well, congratulations. 

00:59:35
ALEXIS BRUMBY And, yeah, it's good. She's going to be a little girl, but, she does have some issues. She is going to be born with spina bifida. 

00:59:40
KENT BUTLER Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 

00:59:40
ALEXIS BRUMBY Yeah. So, we're just learning what all that entails and she's actually going to be paralyzed from her waist down. 

00:59:50
KENT BUTLER Okay. 

00:59:50
ALEXIS BRUMBY So, I'm just worried about my family right now, pretty much. 

00:59:55
KENT BUTLER So, you said that just learning about what all that entails, what's going into learning about? 

01:00:00
ALEXIS BRUMBY We're asking the doctors and the nurses and then also looking it up online, um, learning more about it from a bunch of different resources. 

01:00:05
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, you were saying you're concerned about your parents and, and your family in terms of getting through all this, what types of things are coming up in terms of that? 

01:00:20
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, I just want them to be all right and for them to get good sleep at night, and just have courage and strength to face this. 

01:00:25
KENT BUTLER Well, I know that you're a pretty spiritual person. And, so, maybe we can look at this in terms of what's going to happen now, the next couple of months and the rest of your life for your sister. Um, in regards to the diagnosis, can you think of anything, um, from the bible that might relate to some of the things that you'll need in terms of dealing with the situation? 

01:00:55
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, uh, the story of David and Goliath comes to mind. When he had courage to face the giant. 

01:01:00
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:01:00
ALEXIS BRUMBY And, also the story Daniel in the Lions Den, when he had strength. 

01:01:05
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, you want to be strength based in how you're looking at dealing with... 

01:01:10
ALEXIS BRUMBY Yes. 

01:01:10
KENT BUTLER Certain things that are going on. So, is there anything else that you can think of. Is there another one that you might think of? Is there another story from the bible that you might relate to? 

01:01:20
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, um, nothing comes to mind right now. But, those 2 are the main ones. 

01:01:25
KENT BUTLER Okay. Um, I'm going to invite you to maybe take a part in a process for me right now. 

01:01:30
ALEXIS BRUMBY Okay. 

01:01:30
KENT BUTLER In terms of kind of thinking about, um, building up on your strength and what you can do, maybe working with your family. 

01:01:40
ALEXIS BRUMBY Okay. 

01:01:40
KENT BUTLER In regards to that. So, what I'd like to ask you to do is kind of do a guided imagery. And, I'm going to talk with you and, and walk with some things with you. And, I would like to ask that you, kind of sit back and relax and take a couple deep breaths. Perhaps close your eyes. And, um, I just want to talk about strength. And, when you think of David, David with Goliath and the fact that he is insurmountable, uh, hill... a mountain ahead of him. In terms of trying to defeat this purpose. What's going on for you? What do you think of? 

01:02:30
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, the, um, just the courage that he would have to go through with the situation, and to trust that God would bring him through faithfully on the other side. 

01:02:35
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, what does that look like? Can you say that for me? 

01:02:40
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, strength for me, is like a strong tower. 

01:02:45
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:02:45
ALEXIS BRUMBY Like a very tall tower that would stand and, um, not be able to fall, so. 

01:02:50
KENT BUTLER So, what about David represents that strength? 

01:02:55
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, just that he's a small person and his strength is so big. 

01:03:00
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:03:00
ALEXIS BRUMBY And... 

01:03:00
KENT BUTLER Similar to your baby sister? 

01:03:05
ALEXIS BRUMBY Yes. Yes. 

01:03:05
KENT BUTLER So, what, what, what's that like for you? What are you seeing, in terms of that strength for her? 

01:03:10
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, just being there for her and hoping to give her some of my strength. And, also just helping my parents out and really helping my family would really help me, I think the most. 

01:03:20
KENT BUTLER Okay. Take a deep breath. Let it out. Let's talk about strength in regards to, in terms of what David represents for your parents? What does that look like? 

01:03:40
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, well, just that they would trust God as he trusted, and for, um, just for them to have the same strength that he did. 

01:03:50
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:03:50
ALEXIS BRUMBY And really take in that story and follow after it. 

01:03:50
KENT BUTLER So, in terms of your vision of how you see that, how do you see yourself supporting your parents, in terms of giving it? 

01:04:00
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, doing whatever they need me to do, pretty much. If they need me to watch over the siblings and, um, just do the dishes whenever I can, and help out around the house mostly so that they can worry about Jordan. 

01:04:15
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, you guys gave her a name already. 

01:04:20
ALEXIS BRUMBY Yes. 

01:04:20
KENT BUTLER Okay, so, can you tell me a little bit about, um, how Daniel represents what you're looking for in terms of strength? 

01:04:25
ALEXIS BRUMBY Well, he also trusted God that he would be safe in the Lion's Den, and that God would shut the lion's mouth. 

01:04:30
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:04:35
ALEXIS BRUMBY And, just that my parents and me would have the same idea of strength, I guess. 

01:04:40
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. So, can you kind of think about what that might look like in terms of, being in that den? 

01:04:45
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, well I guess the same strong tower would be the signature of strength for me. 

01:04:55
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, can you think of another thing other than strength that might be something that you're going to grab onto, in terms of how you're dealing with this situation? 

01:05:05
ALEXIS BRUMBY I think also courage is a big factor. 

01:05:10
KENT BUTLER Courage. Okay. 

01:05:10
ALEXIS BRUMBY Strength and courage would be the best. 

01:05:10
KENT BUTLER All right. So, what might you relate to in the bible in terms of courage? 

01:05:15
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, well that could the same David and Goliath story, he had the courage to face the giant. And, then also with Daniel, he had the courage to trust God. 

01:05:25
KENT BUTLER Okay. All right. So, for yourself, I want you to think back now. Just take another deep breath. Breathe in, breathe out. What's it going to take to find that strength within yourself? 

01:05:45
ALEXIS BRUMBY I'm just really trusting in God, that he's going to get me through to the other side. And, I guess just really helping out my parents. 

01:05:55
KENT BUTLER Hmm-hm. 

01:05:55
ALEXIS BRUMBY Because if I help others, that would help me more than just focusing on myself. 

01:06:00
KENT BUTLER Okay. You seem to be very, very strong willed in terms of helping others and making sure everyone else is okay. So, can you tell me a little bit about what you'll do to take care of yourself during this time? 

01:06:15
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, well just, I guess some good things would be to make sure that I get good sleep at night, and, um, eating properly and keeping all those good nutritional things up. 

01:06:25
Anchoring strength image in body 

01:06:30
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, now we're...take another leap of faith with me here, and I want to talk a little bit about, um, where you're feeling things in your body? All right, and so, when you talk about strength, can you kind of give me a place where you know that you are strong and you feel that strength of conviction, of character within your own body? 

01:06:50
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, I think for me, it would be right here in my heart, just...and then also in my shoulders. Just knowing that I have the ability to carry that. 

01:07:00
Feelings often located in body 

01:07:00
KENT BUTLER All right. You know, one of the things about having a strong heart is that it bleeds for others. And so, the fact that you are able to stay strong in your own conviction, and stay strong in terms of your desire to help your sister, and your desire to help your parents, um, I know that you'll find a way to get through this and persevere through this. Can you, kind of, also think about maybe courage? And, where is it that you feel courage in your, in your system? 

01:07:30
ALEXIS BRUMBY Okay. I would say that it starts in my stomach and just kind of goes up from there, and rises up, I guess. 

01:07:40
KENT BUTLER What's that feeling like when it's in your stomach? 

01:07:45
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, just that I'm strong, and I can get through this and knowing that I have the guts to face it. 

01:07:55
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, you're looking at it in terms of guts and those types of things. That's very important in terms of making sure that you know, know that you have the fortitude to kind of stand behind what you believe in. And, and what you trust in. 

01:08:10
ALEXIS BRUMBY Yes. 

01:08:10
KENT BUTLER In terms of what's going to happen in the future. So, can you kind of talk about a little bit, uh, where it is, in terms of, how you see your stength and your courage supporting the family system? 

01:08:25
ALEXIS BRUMBY Um, well, back to helping out just around the house, I guess the small things. And, you know, doing the dishes whenever possible and sweeping the floors or mopping and taking care of the kids. Um, and just being strong for them. 

01:08:45
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, I want to you to just come back out and kind of open your eyes when you feel ready. And, just kind of tell me what's this been like for you in terms of the feeling that was in your body, about courage and strength and, and how you see that in relation to the situation with your baby sister. 

01:09:00
ALEXIS BRUMBY I that the visualization helps me a lot. And, just, um, feeling stronger and being able to picture that gave me mind, a mind picture to go back to. 

01:09:10
KENT BUTLER Okay. So, at any time when you're feeling that you need strength or you need courage, I want you to think about that. 

01:09:20
ALEXIS BRUMBY Okay. 

01:09:20
KENT BUTLER Go into a quiet place, and maybe sit back, take a couple deep breaths, then kind of sit and relax and meditate, and close your eyes and just draw from that strength, draw from that courage. 

01:09:30
ALEXIS BRUMBY Okay.

01:09:35
Never anchor negative images in, the body., Unethical and dangerous., But useful to note BRIEFLY where, the negative image is located., Return immediately to the positive, and strengths.

Influencing Skills:, Strategies For Change, ~ Thought Stopping ~, Carlos Zalaquett, Ph.D., Lic., Keith Kokseng 

01:09:35
Thought-stopping is a brief intervention, to stop negative thoughts and increase, effectiveness., Useful for perfectionism, worrying, ruminative thoughts, excessive culture-, based guilt or shame., Helpful when the more reflective listening, skills fail to produce change and understanding. 

01:09:35
Counselor provides, focus of the session 

01:10:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Keith, good to see you again. Now, um, the purpose of today's, uh, um, session is to focus on a very interesting issues that you described to me last time. So, remind me exactly the situation so we can be, uh, aware of what the, uh, focus on that. 

01:11:00
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I work, um, I'm a file clerk and often times I have to check work, and then I turn it in. But, there's somebody else who checks my work and it gets kicked back to me. And, when that happens, I get really hard on myself. And, from there it's hard for me to focus and I often end up messing up more of my work. 

01:11:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, when you say when they give this back to me, I, I, get sort of hard on me, how, how, do you let that happen? Do you say something in your mind to yourself, or, or how does it go? 

01:11:35
KEITH KOKSENG It almost feels really like automatic. It's like hard for me to describe, but it's just like I keep telling myself that, you know, how could you do this? And, you know, you should be better at this and there are just cycles and I keep thinking about it. 

01:11:45
Note counselor's use of questions, to focus on negative thoughts and, their consequences 

01:11:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, then that helps you to improve your performance for next time? 

01:11:55
KEITH KOKSENG It actually makes it a lot worse. 

01:11:55
Open question 

01:11:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How come? 

01:11:55
KEITH KOKSENG Um, because I focus on it so much more. Um, I can't actually focus on the work. It doesn't feel as comfortable and I'm always nervous and paranoid that I'm actually going to do something wrong. And, it makes it worse than, you know, better. 

01:12:10
Information/psychoeducation 

01:12:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, that is not an uncommon situation. Every time we have a negative thought, usually that thought has a negative impact on ourselves. We feel in a negative way and we also diminish our performance. And, sometimes we even diminish our own self-esteem. Interestingly enough, we have found a technique that is very useful for a number of situations, in which negative thinking is involved. 

01:12:35
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:12:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And that technique is called "Thought Stopping." And, it takes 4 steps to master the technique. The first one is learning the basics. 

01:12:45
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:12:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT The second one is transferring, you know, Thought Stopping into your daily activities and this one will be the case... 

01:12:50
KEITH KOKSENG Right. 

01:12:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT The third one is adding a positive image or thought, and the last one, of course, is to make positive images and thoughts a habit of our mind. A habit of our thinking. 

01:13:10
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:13:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, I think that this is an interesting technique that we can use in your particular situation. And, of course, what we can accomplish today is the first step, then I'm going to give you homework for the second step and we will revisit and continue working on steps 3 and 4 over time. 

01:13:25
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:13:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Does that sound like a plan to you? 

01:13:30
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:13:35
[sil.] 

01:13:35
Thought-stopping steps:, Step 1. Learn the basic process., Step 2. Transfer thought-stopping to your daily life., Step 3. Add positive imaging and thoughts., Step 4. Make positive images and thoughts, a habit. 

01:13:35
Step 1. Learn the basic process. 

01:13:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, we're going to start with learning the basics. 

01:13:45
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:13:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh, do me a favor. Make yourself comfortable in your chair, take a deep breath in and out, allow your body to relax to some extent, close your eyes and remember in your mind one of these days in which the situation that you just described occur. And, go into that situation, let it evolve to the point where you catch yourself having this negative thought in your mind. Very good. Now allow yourself to notice what are the consequences? How did you feel, what do you think, what happens with your body when you have this negative thought? 

01:14:35
KEITH KOKSENG Tenses up a lot. And, um, you know I can still...it's almost like my voice in my head saying, you know, you're stupid and you're not... you should be doing this, there should be no excuse for you failing. 

01:14:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. So, now we have even identified, to some extent, the type of negative thought. Okay? It's very pointing, negative and diminishing. 

01:15:05
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:15:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very strong. Now, let's go back to closing your eyes and re-imagine yourself being in the situation okay? But, this time, okay, once you notice that the negative thought is coming, say stop! In a loud and clear voice to this negative thought. 

01:15:30
[sil.] 

01:15:35
KEITH KOKSENG Stop! 

01:15:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Tell me, what, what happened? What, what did you notice? 

01:15:40
KEITH KOKSENG Well, when I was coming up to the thought, I kind of almost imagined the word stop too, when I was saying it. 

01:15:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, very good. 

01:15:45
KEITH KOKSENG It focused more on the stop itself. Kind of interrupted the thinking. 

01:15:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Kind of interrupted the thinking, which is exactly the approach. That is to interrupt the automatic, sort of, cycle of negative thinking that comes when we catch our self doing something that we didn't like, or somebody criticizes us. The important thing, is that you were able to stop the thought. 

01:16:10
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:16:10
Step 2. Transfer thought-stopping, to your daily life. 

01:16:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, the next step, because we understand now the basics, is to think about how can we move, how can we transfer this very same technique into your daily activities? And, this is what we suggest. The idea is for you to wear a rubberband on your wrist. 

01:16:35
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:16:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT On your work days. And, whenever you're in a situation when you catch yourself entertaining this negative thought, using this negative thought, to snap the rubber band and say in your mind stop! Or, say that out loud, if you're by yourself. Okay? But, of course, if there's people around, it makes sense to say it quietly in your mind. 

01:17:00
KEITH KOKSENG Yeah. 

01:17:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT If you catch yourself having this negative thought, you snap this rubber band and say stop in you mind, or aloud. And, this will give us an opportunity to accomplish 2 different things. To get more acquainted to the way we use negative thought, but in addition, it will give you a sense of how many times this may happen. Or, in, in what type of situations. And, it may even help us, quote unquote, "identify other situations" where we use the same type of negative thinking. 

01:17:30
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:17:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, in those situations, thought-stopping will also be applicable. 

01:17:35
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:17:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Would this, um, possible for you to have this as a homework? 

01:17:40
KEITH KOKSENG Yes. 

01:17:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, engage in thought-stopping between now and our next meeting, a week from now. Uh, and to see how it goes and what happens? And, what did you notice and what did you learn from it? 

01:17:50
KEITH KOKSENG Seems pretty simple enough, sure. 

01:17:55
Step 3. Add positive, imaging and thoughts. 

01:17:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Very good. And, that will be my homework for you, uh, for the next session. And, um, for this week, before the next session. Now, as you do that, you know, um, I would also like for you to notice what could be an alternative thought? You know, a negative thought is identified, what can be a positive thought in that situation? To give you an example, if we go back to, um, people who are anxious when they take tests. 

01:18:30
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:18:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You know, and the idea is, I'm going to fail or I'm a failure. And, then the alternative is, what can you say to yourself that can be opposite to that? One example could be, I will do my best or I did my best. And, or, even if the test doesn't work out okay, it doesn't mean you're going to fail. You have more tests probably. So, the question for you is any alternative thoughts, positive thoughts that you can entertain that are opposite to the ones we just discussed, in your situation? 

01:19:05
KEITH KOKSENG Um, well, I, I could say, you know, there's only a couple things I did wrong. And, not everything was wrong and I did do my best. 

01:19:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Sounds very good. I did my best, I don't mess up with everything, quite the contrary I do more work effectively than not. 

01:19:25
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:19:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, nobody's perfect, isn't it? 

01:19:30
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:19:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, my suggestion then is, the homework is using this rubber band and thought...I'm sorry, and stop to accomplish thought-stopping, but also to think about what alternative thoughts, in addition to the ones we discussed could be used instead? Because, remember, the third step is adding a positive thought or image after you say stop. 

01:20:00
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:20:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Wonderful, so you have your homework, and we will meet again a week from now. 

01:20:05
KEITH KOKSENG All right. 

01:20:10
[sil.] 

01:20:10
Follow-up Session, A week later... 

01:20:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Keith, good to see you again. 

01:20:15
KEITH KOKSENG Good to see you. 

01:20:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT We had, um, an interesting homework assigned last week and I would appreciate if you could share with me, how did it go? 

01:20:25
KEITH KOKSENG Well, surprisingly...I know the homework was just the initial thing about saying stop in my head when these negative thoughts started occurring, but I kind of, you know, you mentioned earlier, uh, last week about putting some positive and replacing the negative. I kind of did that, a little bit and it seems to have actually worked pretty well. 

01:20:45
Note counselor's, use of open question 

01:20:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How interesting. How did you do it? 

01:20:50
KEITH KOKSENG Well, it was just the basic stuff, you know, I could...at first it was even hard for me to say stop, because it was so automatic for me to have these thoughts. But, slowly as I kind of noticed it, um, the stop was a great idea to stop it, but then it would continue. So, putting the positive in there, I just randomly came up with some stuff like, you know, I'm good at other things. You know, I'm not horr...you know, I'm not totally poor at what I'm doing. I'm not perfect. And, it seemed to kind of bring me back up and focus on my work again. 

01:21:20
Note counselor's, frequent encouragers 

01:21:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Wonderful to hear that, and I'm going to ask you a couple of more questions about it. But, before we go there, is, um, you just mentioned 2 very important things to keep in mind when we use this type of technique or thought-stopping. One is that it is very common that once you say stop, you kind of chose (inaudible ), but if you don't do something else, it comes back up again. And, I'm glad that you noticed that, but more importantly, you were able to prevent that from happening by adding the next step. 

01:22:00
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:22:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Which is to add a positive thought or idea or image. And, now...so, kudos to you for that. 

01:22:10
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:22:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What about thought that you added after saying stop? What, what did you come up with? How fascinating. 

01:22:15
KEITH KOKSENG Well, it just kind of came to me, you know, I'm figuring this is not just the only part of my life and there are other things that, you know, I am good at. So, it just kind of went to me, there are other things which you're good at in your life. And... 

01:22:30
Note counselor's use of paraphrasing, and search for strengths 

01:22:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, that was the, the, the, uh, thought that you had? There are other things that I do well? 

01:22:35
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:22:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, why don't you share with me some of the things that you do well? 

01:22:40
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I have a lot of friends and I speak very easily to them and they often come to me for advice. Um, uh, I play tennis very well and I've been playing since I was a kid, and it's something I pride myself in. 

01:22:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Hmm-hm. 

01:22:55
KEITH KOKSENG Um, I generally take care of all my, you know, things at home. You know, just basic stuff like that. 

01:23:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, you have good communication skills, good interpersonal skills, good capacity to take care of things, good (inaudible ) I'm assuming. 

01:23:15
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:23:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, um, also to establish good relationships. And, in a sense, this is sort of like a metaphor, you, you, are changing the relationship, uh, with yourself. 

01:23:25
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:23:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You're moving from negative thoughts to positive thoughts. Wonderful. Now, help me find one, uh, thought that may encompass many of these fields that you have. 

01:23:40
KEITH KOKSENG Just one thought? 

01:23:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT If you can find like an umbrella identifier. 

01:23:45
KEITH KOKSENG Well, I kind of, I guess what I said before, really. I'm good at other things. 

01:23:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You are good at other things. So, you have multiple skills? 

01:23:55
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:23:55
Step 4. make positive images, and thoughts a habit. 

01:23:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, what about them? To continue this following week, using the thought-stopping technique, plus the addition of the positive thought. 

01:24:10
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:24:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, see how that goes. But, before we do that, I imagine that you noticed something after you did this, what was your outcome? 

01:24:20
KEITH KOKSENG Um, both physically and mentally I wasn't as stressed. And, I was actually able to do my job a lot more efficiently and better, um, than when I started to get really, really hard on myself. 

01:24:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, that reinforces the idea of continuing the practice. 

01:24:40
KEITH KOKSENG Hmm-hm. 

01:24:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, now you have a clear sense of a positive thought that you can use, to add this stop, or after you say stop! And, we will look at it again a week from now. 

01:24:50
KEITH KOKSENG Okay. 

01:24:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good.
