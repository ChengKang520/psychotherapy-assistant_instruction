00:00:05
DAVE GOLDSMITH Good morning, everybody. There’s a kit up the front. Can you come and grab one. Can you make sure you have a kit because you kinda need that. 

00:00:15
[sil.] 

00:00:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH  Good morning. There is a kit up here, if you’d like to grab one. And then find yourself an elbow partner. Now I don't care if you wanna work with two, three, four, get in a group. And as I’ll explain, this is about creativity. There are no rules here. You do it the way you feel comfortable. I’ll just guide you along. And if you feel comfortable doing it the way you do then do it that way. 

00:00:55
[sil.] 

00:01:00
DAVE GOLDSMITH For those of you that have the book, you’re gonna find I have a write-up on page 23. We won’t need that today, but if you like to know a little bit more about me that’s where you'll find it. Right, I think we just have one or two people left in that set then we'll get going. Good morning. There is a kit up the front. Can I make sure everybody has a kit. I'm gonna say like a broken record once more and then we’ll get going. 

00:01:35

00:01:40
DAVE GOLDSMITH Alright, before I start off, for those of you that turned up yesterday to attend my class, I wasn't here, so my apologies. And I stayed in Los Angeles because the flight that I was sitting in, broke down, didn't go anywhere and the spare part was in San Francisco. And so they emptied out 300 people on a plane, put us in a hotel room and I sat there thinking about everybody here that turned up to my class and I wasn’t here. We’ll get going now. This morning I'm gonna take you through creativity and how it relates to children. And this class is about having fun. That’s the main ingredient. For those of you that like to take notes, I don’t know really have a lot of notes, but believe that we have a CD around that has the information on it. If not, please see me afterwards and I’ll be quite happy to email the complete PowerPoint and everything that I have. Otherwise, creativity doesn’t really have any rules. So we'll just go with the flow here. Now, I’ve got you for an hour-and-a-half. Guaranteed, it's gonna seem like five minutes. 

00:03:00
[sil.] 

00:03:05
DAVE GOLDSMITH And also I have the video screen down here, so it's not that I'm ignoring you. It just that I get to look at this and then get to look at you. First of all, I'd like to open this workshop with just the thought about the traditional indigenous owners of this land and also to be mindful that as I talk to you apart from you that are present, we also have a video or video audience. So, if I mention you, I don’t mention the video audience. Please be marked that they're actually video only. Smart technology, what is it? It's one of these guys. Smart technology. Do you have one of these, throw it on silent, vibrate or anything you like to do. An elbow friend, well that’s the friend either on your left or right elbow or friends if you’re in a group. Once again, this class is creativity, so you can gather, get together, but you're gonna need at least two or more. Well, who am I? My name is Dave Goldsmith.

00:04:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH And I originate from New Zealand, moved to Australia on a Christmas holiday. It was a one-way trip. I came here in 1978. And he was a whaler. His ship was the Elizabeth, 1850. That’s my great, great grandfather, Manuel Jose. He migrated from the south of Spain, went to Peru, and then migrated from Peru to New Zealand. Raised a family and that was my great, great grandfather. My grandfather is Harry Goldsmith and my parents are Goldsmith. And so, I'd like to start this off by asking you if you can raise one of your hands and you need to repeat after me, except you just substitute your family. My name is Dave. My father is Arthur. My mother is Joyce. My great grandfather is Harry Goldsmith. And my great, great grandfather is Manuel Jose from Spain. This is me, this is my family, wrap them around. And that’s like a holistic view of how we deal with our clients. They’re not just on their own, they had family. And in American Indian, they call it the hand, everybody has a hand, all your clients that turn up, no matter what age they are, they have a hand, they have themselves, they have their family and it gets wrapped around them. This is what you're in for the next 90 minutes. Right after introduction, we’ll go into bi-hemispheric lateralization and sensing, that’s the five senses. I had a case file for you, we'll see how we go for time, then there is a program called Beyond the Violence which is run by Anglicare, and then I’ll close with some questions.

Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:06:45
Introduction 

00:06:45
Domestic and/or Family Violence: 

00:06:45
While both include the word ‘violence’ this workshop will simply use domestic 

00:06:45
violence (DV) in the context related to children between 2 to 16 years of age 

00:06:45
exposed to any family member, partner or co-partner who attempts to physically 

00:06:45
or psychologically dominate or harm another. Children exposed to DV occurs in 

00:06:45
all geographic areas of Australia and all socio economic and cultural groups. 

00:06:45
The general reaction of DV may include any of the following 

00:06:45
Perpetrator may be an individual or a group 

00:06:45
Victim may be an individual or a group 

00:06:45
Can include extended family members 

00:06:45
The acts of victim my contribute physical, psychological, emotional, social, 

00:06:45
economic and/or sexual abuse 

00:06:45
Acts of violence are on going over a period of time 

00:06:45
DAVE GOLDSMITH This workshop is the area of children exposed to domestic and family violence. I've put both words in this, some of you might gravitate towards one or either those words. Otherwise, they mean the same thing.

ACA Conference – Melbourne Australia 2011 

00:06:55
Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:06:55
Introduction 

00:06:55
The arts: 

00:06:55
Ancient civilization believed there is a connection between the healing 

00:06:55
proportion brought about through the interaction of all five senses and our ability 

00:06:55
to apply this knowledge into some form of artistic therapy or the modern day 

00:06:55
version know as art psychotherapy. This involves the counselor using different 

00:06:55
art mode through which the client can express and work through their own 

00:06:55
personal issues, problems or concerns. In this therapeutic relationship between 

00:06:55
ancient therapist and client both are required to engage in working together. 

00:06:55
It is easier to express a full range of non-verbal communication techniques 

00:06:55
through the use of a large range of art media all of which would allow the client to 

00:06:55
make sense of their own experience. This is through the use of art objects 

00:06:55
that are used as the focus of discussion, reflection or analysis at any stage of the 

00:06:55
client's progress in a safe and increasing environment. Clients can be referred to 

00:06:55
a counselor with artistic therapy experience while in doing so it is not a 

00:06:55
requirement the client has had any previous experience or still in the arts. 

00:06:55
DAVE GOLDSMITH  What is domestic violence? Apart from what I’ve got written up there, domestic violence if we were to summon up is simply an individual that can't really be free, controlled by a person or a behavior and it is something that happens here in Melbourne, here in Australia and everywhere else. It's fairly common. Here in Australia, it seems to have come out a lot more, but doesn’t mean that’s new. My guess is, it's been around a long time and I'm sure there are experts in this workshop that know more about it than I do. And my part here at this workshop is about creativity, but unfortunately I do work in this area of domestic violence. Domestic violence once again if you use that hand, then the perpetrator can be an individual, a group, or it can be related to the individual, that can be the individual’s family. The same with the victim. The victim can be a single person or can be an individual. It can extend to family members. Once again, it can be family members. An act of violence constitutes physical, psychological, emotional, social, economic and sexual abuse. Acts of violence are ongoing over a period of time.

Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:08:35
Introduction 

00:08:35
The arts.... 

00:08:35
This workshop will demonstrate a range of different fundamental applications that 

00:08:35
can be used in the context of family introduction / domestic violence. This is to 

00:08:35
produce artistic date with a child's counseling session and as such will provide 

00:08:35
participants with ideas for using the artistic data within the counseling 

00:08:35
environment. 

00:08:35
Although this workshop's focus is on children exposed to DV, the workshop will 

00:08:35
provide some immediate ready-to-use simple and practical artistic topic for 

00:08:35
counselors, psychotherapist, psychologists and other mental health 

00:08:35
professionals working outside the context of family intervention. These topics are 

00:08:35
transferable to other children, young people, adolescents or adults. 

00:08:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, this is the fun part, art. How do we use that and what is it? Well, that's been around a long, long time. Ancient civilizations used it. They believe that there is a connection between art and our emotions and how we do things. I’ll go into this further. But otherwise art has been around for a fairly long time and we now have therapists and counselors call that therapies. It's a fairly new -- it's a feeling new career here in Australia. In the US it's fairly old hat and you could quit easily walk into the therapists office and run into a therapist. Here in Australia, you’re not likely to, but tend to gravitate in places other than clinical offices. And the easiest way to explain our therapy is, our therapy simply uses any form of medium to assist you with your client. Well, if you read the biotomy, this class is the dealing with the children. I work with children between the ages of 2.5, two-and-a-half, up to 16. My average age grid, ten through to five. But what we're gonna do today, you can use with children, youth, young people, adults, the elderly. All you have to do is modify it. And once again, if I can mention, this class is about creativity. So you simply take what I’m giving you and you modify it to fit what you’ve got. Inside your kit you will have some paper that you’ll need, you will have a pencil, courtesy of Wal-Mart in Los Angeles and you’ll have some colored crayons, once again courtesy of Wal-Mart in Los Angeles, and you’ll have some photos. Nothing special about these photos. I travelled around the US for the last four weeks taking photos knowing that’ll be standing in front of you and they‘ll be needed. You can use any photos that you have when you leave here and you use this program with your clients. You don’t have to use photos, you can you anything else, but you'll need to. )These photos are random. There's no special secrets of photos in your kit. I simply took the photo and put them in.

00:11:20
Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:11:20
Introduction 

00:11:20
Child’s own data: 

00:11:20
The child’s artistic data is simply any form of non-verbal communication 

00:11:20
provided by the child to enable the counselor to explore and therapeutic control 

00:11:20
child's preventing issue into an artistic medium regardless of both counselor and 

00:11:20
or child's artistic sense. This simply means participants do not have in have any 

00:11:20
artistic or 'The Arts' related qualification to join the workshop presentation. If 

00:11:20
you can hold a pen or pencil and draw a fine or struggle then you have the 

00:11:20
basics to start collecting data. 

00:11:20
The workshop will provide various artistic approaches through interactive 

00:11:20
demonstrations and provide participants some simple look to assist with the 

00:11:20
collision of the child's data to be used and converted into an artistic 

00:11:20
representation than used to provide direction during the counseling sessions. 

00:11:20
Data conversion can be represented on a simple artistic form such as colorful 

00:11:20
pictures on paper or complex conversion such as assisting the child to design a 

00:11:20
narrative story from the ground up complete with characters, architects and 

00:11:20
make presence with story timeframe all built for the child's own data. 

00:11:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH The arts. What I am gonna take you through today is how to use that kit with your client. And so this workshop will demonstrate a range of different multimodal approaches. Multimodal is simply using other than talking, cognitive thinking, it's using other things to help you with your client. Now, what I'd just focus is on children exposed to DV. As I said, you can use this kit or what I'm gonna go through with you anyway you like. Once again, creativity has no rules to it. Also I believe can go-(ph) used the phrase it's like a unconscious world, it doesn’t belong to anybody. So creativity doesn’t actually belong to any one person. Even if that’s out there, it's free to use. This kit can be used by professionals, counselors, psychologists, mental health, you can use it in education, children, age care, it's quite broad.

Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:12:35
Introduction 

00:12:35
Counseling environment: 

00:12:35
From this fact alone it is clear that the child has the opportunity to believe therapy 

00:12:35
or even to visit both present and past realized events that may to responsible for 

00:12:35
that crisis or preventing issues and therefore takes the counseling session 

00:12:35
beyond just talking about the issue it now adds splashes of color, lines, 

00:12:35
shapes, taste, smell and a vast array of human emotions and experience to the 

00:12:35
child's story. 

00:12:35
A story now externalized onto paper, canvas or any manner of artistic medium 

00:12:35
used in the conversion state. The child's artistic expression can into be 

00:12:35
expressed in any one or all of the healing properties brought about through the 

00:12:35
interaction of all five senses and the counselor's ability to apply the knowledge 

00:12:35
into some form of artistic therapy. This workshop will provide participants with 

00:12:35
instant ready to use artistic ideas easily transferable into the counseling 

00:12:35
environment. 

00:12:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH The kit will help you because what we’ll need to help our client is data. And so for those you that have been through university, done statics, you will need some data to work with, you’ll need some clients, you collect the information from the clients, put it all together, it gives you data. From that data you can then formulate something. Same with our clients. Our clients turn up, tell us something. Whatever they tells us is the data that you’re about to use because you’ll need that to work with, and that’s what we're doing with this kit. We’ll be using that to collect some data. 

00:13:10

Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:13:10
My story 

00:13:10
Star Wars: 

00:13:10
My story starts with my first 1970's visit and cinema introduction of the big screen movie 

00:13:10
'Star Wars'. What is it about this battle that I can related with, it is the good guy versus 

00:13:10
bad guy. Maybe the fact that the good guy battles much than his rival is really as 

00:13:10
better. Or simply the deep connection as the good guy battles with the enemy in 

00:13:10
warfield. Maybe good can thrash over bad. 

00:13:10
9/11: 

00:13:10
September 11th 2001 I remember well. I remember the time, place, and who I shared that 

00:13:10
source with as I watched the events unfold as it a 1970's movie unfolded. I even remember 

00:13:10
my emotional state as this narrative slowly went from sensing safe to dealing unsafe. What 

00:13:10
now, 9/11 and terrorism. How does that relates to counseling? 

00:13:10
Pursue Counseling: 

00:13:10
While Star Wars may have provided some idea about human struggle over adverse and 

00:13:10
sometimes un-controllable human events that would seem so real, its hard to believe it's a 

00:13:10
movie. 9/11 provided the shock value that reality can be rather grime and ugly. While Star 

00:13:10
Wars & 9/11 provided just as many reasons for and against my becoming a counselor in a 

00:13:10
rather odd way, both also provided the same reasoning for me to pursue counseling. 

00:13:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH  From that data you’ll then convert it into something that you can use with your client. And once again, when you collect that data, it's up to you as to how that data gets used. Once again, creativity doesn’t really have any rules, you can make the rules as you go along, you can construct your own set of rules if you like, before or after or during. At the end, when you finish with your client, you wanna document this, put in your case files, you can do that. If you wanna modify so that you wanna put some rules in, you can do that. As you can see, it's very flexible. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
DAVE GOLDSMITH Then at the counseling environment, well, that would be your office, wherever you are. If you have private practice, clients come to you. If not, you may work for an organization, you maybe freelance, you might move around, regardless the counseling environment is wherever that you decide to want to use this kit. Now, the counseling environment could be in your office, could be out in the park, could be in football, volleyball, McDonald’s, KFC, Starbucks, you decide where you wanna use this. Your client what you -- well, your client will give you some information. And so what we'll do with this information is externalize it and take it and pull it on to something so you can use this. Now, there are several ways you can use this information. I’m giving you a very simple kit to use, you can if you like, put together a Hollywood show with dress up, make up, props, costumes. It's up to you as has to how far you wanna take this. I'm guessing somewhere in this audience I create this people that have dress-making skills, narrative skills, if you don’t, you can just stick to this very basic kit otherwise you can expand it to fit whatever you’ve got.

What's Your Story 

00:15:35
Test 2 

00:15:35
1. What’s your movie 

00:15:35
2. What’s your 9/11 

00:15:35
3. Highlight or underline key words 

00:15:35
4. 'What does it all mean'? 

00:15:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH My story, Star Wars, I watched that movie when I was a kid and thought it was great, I can relate to it. I thought the part where Darth Vader reveled himself was a sort of telling moment for me. If you’ve watched Star Wars, maybe there is a scene in that’s Star Wars that you can relate to. Similar to our clients, they turn up that are Star Wars somewhere, something that will gravitate towards something that is stuck in there and what is it. Well, for me it's a image, a picture, it's an emotion. That’s what’s inside me somewhere. And it would be your job to find out what it is and get that image out. So turning to 9/11. For the US, two buildings fell down, lots of people were killed. I know where I was when that happened, what I was doing, who I was with. I knew what I felt. I didn’t quite believe it when I first saw it. I thought it might have been just a flight accident, just an accident and that was it. But after the second planned hit, there are something weird and strange going on. I remember that because it's inside me somewhere and it's a set of images, emotions and feelings. Our clients would have the same thing, they'll have their 9/11. And so, as counselors, using creativity, it's your job to somehow get in there and find out what is the client’s emotional feeling, what is that image, where is it and why does it gravitate so much for that client. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
DAVE GOLDSMITH I’ll just read the last line. What Star Wars and 9/11 provided just as many reasons for gangs mob becoming a counselor in a rather odd way. But I've also provided the same reason for my to pursue counseling. One of the ways as got into counseling, Star Wars and 9/11. Maybe you have a reason as to why you came into counseling. Whatever the reason is, it will be the emotion, it'll be a feeling somewhere inside you. 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH So your task, if you’d like to take a couple of minutes, grab your piece of paper and what’s your movie, what’s your 9/11, you have your elbow partner, I’ll give you a minute-and-a-half if you just like to write something down on your sheet of paper, why did you get into counseling, what’s your movie, what’s your 9/11. Just substitute those two for what you’ve done. What’s you gonna do with that information. After you write that information down, you'll find some words, there’ll be some words that gravitate, but you like underline those words. There are some colored crayons in your kit, use one of those crayons, and color you like and underline the word that you like as you write. So if you're talking about your movie, if you're mentioning a movie that you like that you gravitate towards, take your colored pencil and highlight one word that you like. The same for your 9/11. All you need is one word from each. If you don’t have any words, you don't have to, you can use the picture, an image, symbol. Right, looks like we'll move on to the next one.

Counseling children using the interaction of all five senses 

00:19:30
My story 

00:19:30
Technology or Hospitality: 

00:19:30
It's 1979, at 17, my career officer provided two options for a long term practice towards 

00:19:30
career. (1) electronic engineer or (2) Chef. I didn't think I would be any 

00:19:30
good as a professional cook, so the option of 8 years worth of a engineer was the winner. 

00:19:30
While this career provided the incentive to be the best I can, like all things between the day 

00:19:30
you wake up and find reasons not to go to work, rather it's not the work, it's the career, there 

00:19:30
maybe it's time to find something else (The year is 2000). 

00:19:30
What gets me out of bed: 

00:19:30
Thoughts of a career as a counselor started late 2000. Early 2005, I started both study 

00:19:30
and work within the area of alcohol and drug work resulting in my cert IV Alcohol & other 

00:19:30
Drugs work. 2006 progressed with my dip Community Welfare Work before finding my 

00:19:30
place within this community service after completing my dip Art Therapy in 2009. I have a 

00:19:30
broad background as a volunteer within the community as a mentor for young people and 

00:19:30
adults as well as facilitating programs for children exposed to family violence. Other related 

00:19:30
experience includes an extensive background in case management with department of 

00:19:30
justice and chairmen advocate for students attending TAFE. I finally joined and became a 

00:19:30
member of the NYACA & ACA early 2010, Member of VFC early 2011. 

00:19:30
DAVE GOLDSMITH  Technology and hospitality. Well, when I was 17, my career counselor gave me two choices. And I could either do technology, it's electronic engineering or be a chef. I decided against chef, I didn’t think I'd be much better cooking, so I took the technology. Somewhere in the year 2000, after working many years in technology, technology has to do with machines, people come second, somehow they didn’t quite fit with me, so I decided I needed to change. I suppose if we had a client that would be a lot of style change. Regardless, are changed, not easy. I applied for community welfare cost, I looked up my resume, nothing but computers and technology and corporate, they told me to go somewhere else. And so I took a while to break into counseling. So what gets me out to bed? Around the year 2000 I got out of bed, figured this is it, I’ll just bring my boss find an excuse not to go in. The day you do that is the day you need to find something else to do. So what gets me out of bed for counseling? I enjoy the work I do. I enjoy working with people. And I'm guessing that everybody here has the same. You enjoy working with people. In Los Angeles only just recently that I joined ACA, Australian Counsel’s Association, Federation of Victorian Counselors and also the New York Heart Therapy Association.

The difference between the two hemispheres of the brain is

Therapists working with creative tools are in a prime position to 

00:21:20
utilize the growing understanding about lateralization of the brain.

DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, we’re just gonna do some technical stuff. You’ll need this information. Bi-hemispheric lateralization, what is it? Well it's simply that we know that we have left and right hemisphere. For some crazy reason if your left and your right had a conversation, either one of them would be looking at you blank. The right understands images, symbols, emotions. The left is very logical. If the left was to ask the right a question, the right would have no idea. The right would ask the left equation, it would be an image, a symbol, an emotion. That plans have that same thing. Bi-hemispheric lateralization simply is how do we get those two to talk. For those of us that work with children, we know that children can be very emotional. Wherever emotional, when a person is coming from a emotional state, you could pretty much say that is coming from the right. The left is sitting there, doing nothing. So how did you get that child back, easiest way to do is ask them to count. Count forwards, count backwards count something. You wanna count the chairs, count the pencils, makes no difference. We're just in the count, account, that left part will then kick in and take over. That is really the basics of left or right. For creativity, we could probably say that our therapists and those that work in creativity are right brain specialists, we work in that area and believe mental health was always has the same. And therefore, we know that the right works with some of these that I’ve got listed here.

DAVE GOLDSMITH The left, left is very logical. It stores the language. So when you did this small exercise, something incredible happened. And as I got you to do your 9/11 and as I got you to do your movie, you actually assessed either one or the other of your hemisphere. Logically, to write you’d have used the left. Somehow I just sat there thinking about something, thinking image what it popped up in your mind that would have come from the right.

"Our five senses are the key to observation and contract with material reality 

00:24:20
Sensing is our way of gathering and checking information about the world. 

00:24:20
How well our senses function will determine out level of awareness and ability 

00:24:20
to interact with our environment. Many people tend to rely on second-hand 

00:24:20
information (other people, the media) about the world and find it difficult to

gather, trust or make use of the data supplied by their own sensory

"This can seriously limit ability to test our beliefs and expectations and result

in poor flexibility and adaptation to changes in our environment. Sharpening

our senses will increase our ability to notice the substance of shape, tone,

DAVE GOLDSMITH Sensing. What is that? We live in a world that’s really quite complex. Sensing, really the five senses of the body. We have perfume, we have food, we have fabrics. Somehow we have become discentized to the environment we live in. I had a friend and I par along the perfume and as one of us -- look, I can smell your perfume sort of from the other side of the room. That is sensitized to it us, become used to it. Our clients have the same feeling, our clients become desensitized to this senses. So how do we get them back, how do we get them back to into their body, how do we get their senses, their five senses where it can be gained. That’s you challenge, Further up, I have a case scenario for you, that’s a challenge is how do you that. No, incidentally the kit you've got, if you notice the two photographs, you can substitute those two photographs for anything that tastes, smell, touch. You can use two fabric, two fruit, two perfume, it's up to you is what you do but you need two of them. So, a perfume is something visual, you can use it some auditory, you can use two sounds, two fabrics, if you're using someone with a visual impairment, you might used two fabrics.

What’s missing, how do use the five senses, sock hair and hearing taste, smell, touch. DV in child’s senses, DV reports notifications, I'm guessing a lot of you have paper work, goes with the job, goes with territory. We’ve already have paperwork professional, you read that, some of that information would be that what’s missing, or how do you use the five senses to understand those reports. An example of that is doctor sends you a report, you only read the report and you may to ask yourself, what’s missing from this report. What can't you hear, what can’t you taste, what kind you smell, what can't you here. What’s missing. And so you can fill 'em in lines quite easily.

DAVE GOLDSMITH Task three, we often see what we expect to see or what we think we should see rather than what is actually there. Take a look and think about an experience with a client that you’ve had where this applies. That turned out you're upsized than that, worked it out, formulated something in your mind, come to some sort of a conclusion, the four clients really had a chance to tell you their story, you've meant to sort of work out what is it they need. At the end of the session maybe the client shall do something. That is the basics of what I was saying, what’s missing. So when the client turns up and is not talking to you, what’s missing from that conversation, what can't you hear, is that client talking to you about their family, can you hear kids having fun, can you hear mum and dad, can you hear family, that’s usually the five senses, very basic stuff.

DAVE GOLDSMITH  Right, we’ve got a case file. Now, I’ll show you two case files and if you like to take some notes, while I mean is take notes. And then after these three case files, you get to choose one, so while I take you through case file one, I’ll take you through case file two, you choose which one you like, so if you like this one, let's have a look if we can go. There is two of them. They're identical. One is from Australia, one is from the US. Now maybe it's the color you like in these case files. Maybe it's the background color you like, maybe there is something in here that you gravitate too, maybe you've we're worked in the US. Now, once again this is about creativity, if you haven't worked in US, maybe you’ve worked somewhere else, but you need to, one from your local area Australia, the other client from offshore. And if you haven't traveled offshore, you can use mine. You can make your own up, but you’ll need to. Now this client, his name is Jason, he’s seven years old. is a small build, he enjoys the outdoor activities. He’s got a solid mum, violent dad, court order. At the bottom, the environment, is it safe, is it unsafe. His family, parents and siblings, all you need to do is fill in the missing information. So in your sheet of paper, if you like this case file, use those last five and just substitute what I’ve got for you wanna put in there, you can use what I’ve got. And so, for environment, you can either put safe or unsafe. It's up to your which one you pick. If you would like this case file to be safe, you’d just write safe, if you want unsafe, write unsafe. And so, on your sheet of paper what you need to do, case file one, Australia environment, put the word safe or unsafe. Once again for family, if you want your client to have parents, mum and dad still living together, you can do that. If you want your client to have siblings, you can add that to them or you can use what I’ve got here. Jason has solid mum, has a dad, but there's a court order that stops him. Right, the location. You can use the location right here in Melbourne, your location from where did you come from, just substitute what I’ve got for a location that you want. You can use a client that you know, you can use a client that you’ve recently worked with. For dangers? No. Your client - - you can add it to this, your client has a knife. Your client is violent, he uses his feet to kick, he uses his fists to punch, he uses an object to throw, you can pick one of that, you can all of them, you can add your own chart. 

00:32:45

DAVE GOLDSMITH I’ll move on to case file two. 

00:32:55

00:33:00

DAVE GOLDSMITH I’ve picked this one. It's Rocky, he’s seven years old. I actually worked with him, the Bronx, New York City. You can find your own Rocky, but you'll have to find someone from offshore, if not you can make one out. Once again you have the same thing environment. Does Rocky come from safe environment or unsafe environment, does Rocky have parents, siblings. In this case Rocky has parents, mom and dad, still living together. Rocky has one sister, she's about five. Rocky lives in the Bronx in New York City. Attends school just around from where he lives. They're are not dangerous, Rocky owns a nine millimeter hand gun that's when I met him, het turned up his anger. 

00:34:20

00:34:25
DAVE GOLDSMITH You can substitute danger for something else, but you'll need a weapon of some sort. You can use shot gun, hand gun, gun, bazooka, tank M-16, notary rifle.

[sil.] 

00:34:55
DAVE GOLDSMITH How is everybody going? Have you got that? Right. 

00:35:00
[sil.] 

00:35:05
DAVE GOLDSMITH Okay. This is the fun part. This is where you use in our kits. I'd like you to grab the kit. Inside you'll find a sheet of paper. Grab one sheet of paper. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:25
DAVE GOLDSMITH In the sheet of paper, there will be a middle section, a top and a bottom. One of your pictures will go on the top, one of your pictured will go on the bottom. You'll have a middle space that we'll use. So just keep conscious of that as we go along. Now the picture can go anywhere at the top, it doesn't matter where, it can go left, right, center, anyway you like, but it's gotta go in the top. And one picture goes on the bottom, anywhere on the bottom, doesn't make any difference and you'll have a middle section left. In that middle section, grab something you can put your piece of paper on, a surface of some sort, and I would like you to scribble some circles in that center. Make circles, more circles, any circle you like. There is no any rules to the circle, you do the circle the way you feel, but scribble something in the middle. Now you can use the pencil, you can use the colors. 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:50
DAVE GOLDSMITH You have two pictures. One picture will fit on the top, one will in the bottom. There'd be a nice space in the middle. In that middle, if you take your pencil or one of your colors, just scribble something right in the middle. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH No rules to how you make that scribble. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, after you've done that, I would like you to put some lines intersecting, simply like that. Lines that intersect. It's up to you as how you do those lines, minimum would be three, maximum is up to you, but just do some lines that intersect. And why you're doing that? What you're doing is you're actually accessing right hemisphere to put some information down. 

00:37:50
[sil.] 

00:37:55
DAVE GOLDSMITH Once you've completed that, take a look at what you've got, a squiggle with some lines. Look into it and see if you can find an image, something you like. Take one of your colors, highlight that image that you like, that's in that squiggle somewhere. You will find something in there, a shape that you like. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:25
DAVE GOLDSMITH As many of you like, minimum is one. 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH Once you found that shape, it's up to you, you can leave it the way it is or fill it in. You can fill in all the shapes you found, you can fill in one shape you found. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:50
DAVE GOLDSMITH The basics of our therapy is we use the right hemisphere, that's what you're doing. Somewhere in your right hemisphere you're accessing some information, found a symbol that you gravitate towards. And our clients have something similar. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now for those of you that have used a pencil to do your work, at the end of the pencil is an eraser. You can use the eraser to erase the other pencil lines and leave your image. For those of you that have used the crayon, it makes no difference. You can leave it the way it is. We'll still use this. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:40
DAVE GOLDSMITH The image stays, everything counts, the pencil lines go if you've used pencil. If you've used crayon, you can use -- leave the crayon lines there. All we're interested is the image. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:05
DAVE GOLDSMITH What you should be left with now is task seven, just a colored image sitting in the middle of your sheet of paper. That's all you'll have. Doesn't matter if you've got rubbed out pencil, crayon, what we're interested in is the image. How are you going? Great. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
DAVE GOLDSMITH Right. This is my time check. We'll see how we're going for time, 09:43. We're doing well. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
DAVE GOLDSMITH You have two pictures in your kit. I would like you to take one of those pictures, one that you like. You like the picture for whatever reason it is that you like it. Pick one of those pictures. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:15
DAVE GOLDSMITH The second one will obviously be the picture that you don't really like that much. One you will like. One, nah. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:30
DAVE GOLDSMITH The picture that you selected, that you like, take a look at it and just think about what is it about that picture that you like. Is there something in there, is it a color, is it a shape, is it natures, is it man made, is it something in the corner, is it something in the background. No matter what is in that picture, as you do this exercise, you're using your right hemisphere shuffling through information in your mind to try to find an image that matches what's here. When you finish that do the same for the second picture. There's something in the second picture that you don't like, doesn't quite grab you, find what that is. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH We're going good for time, so you can take you time on this. The picture that you like, use one of your crayons, write on the back of it what you like about that picture, one word or half sentence. You can use an image, a symbol or a picture or happy smiley face, a smiley face. You can use the word nice, feel good, I like this. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH Oh, thank you. Do the same for the second picture, something about that picture that doesn't quite grab you, you don't quite like it, something odd about it simply because there's one you like and there's obviously one that you don't like. And if I could just remind you of that two case files. 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:45
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, while you're doing that, for our audience at home, for those that are watching this, you can do the same. You can a grab a picture out of your photo album, you can use it on your computer, you can a digital picture. If you've got Photoshop, Windows 7, Windows XP, you can do the same thing. You can print up a picture, you can visualize it, you can use your iPad, iPhone, smartphone, there's not limits to what you can do. Once you've got your two pictures organized, at the top of your piece of paper just write in a very brief paragraph, sentence, what it is about that picture you like. Just write it at the top in that space up here. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:45
DAVE GOLDSMITH While you're doing that, if you happen to find yourself in a airport, your client rings you, if you have a smarphone, iPhone, iPad, tablet, notebook, Internet kiosk, a piece of paper, a sheet of paper, pen, a pencil, you can do this. 

00:45:05
[sil.] 

00:45:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH When you finish that, do the same for on the bottom. One paragraph, why you don't like that picture. Then you can do one paragraph, a whole paragraph, you can write in the back of the piece of paper, you can use a symbol, a picture, an image, it's up to you as what you do. You can use one word, two words, one sentence. One of the great things about creativity is it just simply works the way you want to work, it's not geared to any particular personality, person, nationality. It simply has a beautiful way of finding its way around whatever it is that you wanna do with it. You can personalize it, what we're doing now you can personalize, make it fit what you wanna do. 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH We're going pretty good for time, so how about I give you one or two minutes, think about what you've put down and share it with your elbowed buddy. So I'll give you two minutes to share it with your elbowed buddy, then I'll slip over and I'll give your elbowed buddy two minutes to share it back. Tell them what you found, what is it in that image, share it with your elbowed buddy. Now incidentally, if you happen to be sit at home watching this, you can ring a friend, talk to your partner, talk to someone next to you. And if you're on the chat line, you can do the same thing, you can share your information as well for those that are watching this. Right. As you close up with your partner, you can keep talking and I'll just go ever a couple things with you. What you've done is an exercise that accessed your right hemisphere. Somewhere in there was an image, a feeling or sensation, something that you gravitated towards in the picture. The picture I got for random, I drove around US taking photos. I actually have 1,200 photos on my flash drive. I went to Wal-Mart’s all time yesterday, developed a pair, 170 of them in my room last night, just grabbed them and put them in your kit, not particular fashion of order. Grab these beautiful crayons, they're like $0.87 at Wal-Mart’s, did the same thing, put up in your kit. And so there was really no structure or order to what we did. And as you experienced, there's something about this picture that you like, there's something about the other picture you don't like. Then you have this symbol. You may have found something in the symbol, something that took you back somewhere. Whatever happened, what you experienced as you did this exercise is bilateral, it is have those two parts of your mind started sharing information and talking. That is really the basics of it. Unfortunately, our clients don't have that luxury. Some of them dominate, they're very emotional and everything is in that area or sometimes very left brained, very logical, nothing can be right. You can use this exercise to do that. You can just say, maybe this is the left-right yoga, the left-right exercise relaxation, and that's really basically this class is about. It's how you get those two to work, how you use that with your client, how you use that with children. You can substitute this for sand, down the sand, for those that use sandplay, you can use the same thing. You can use the sand play at kindergarten, football field, oval, you can use this anywhere with your client. You don't need this piece of paper. You can substitute everything we've done on the fly, you can use whatever you see around you, a building, if you happen to be out in the country, the hills, in the city you can use anything, the foreground and background as the two objects you wanna talk about. Somewhere on that sheet of paper that you had, you would have written down information about two clients. Why do you need two clients? You need a positive and a negative, you need something you like, something that you dislike. Your clients will have the same thing. And so pick two clients that were totally different. The difference between the two clients, one client you find in Australia. I'm guessing a lot of you may not have clients that turn up at your home and wherever you work. Generally, they're not gonna turn up with a handgun.

00:50:20
What is BTV: 

00:50:20
BTV is an 8 week 2 1/2 hour progress with counseling parents group and children's 

00:50:20
group, that is contained 'family life' activity for families who have been impacted by 

00:50:20
family violence. BTV is founded in Melbourne, Australia. It is available within the 

00:50:20
Southern metro region with Anglicare Victoria 

00:50:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH They won't turn up. And if they get angry with you, chances are they're not gonna take their handgun out and show you what they can do with it, nor will they share with you who they just shot. Sorry? 

00:50:30
 (inaudible ). 

00:50:35
DAVE GOLDSMITH Yes. I worked with a client. His name was Bronks. He was seven years old. He borrowed his dad's handgun, brought it to my office. We sat and we looked at it. He showed me how to use it. Incidentally, before I took the work in the Bronx, I went to a gun range, spent three hours, they showed me how to use a handgun safely. I then showed it to my client, seven-year old Bronks how to safely use a handgun, how to put it on safety, how to take the handgun and cock it back, take the cartridge out, make sure it's empty, drop the cartridges out of the bottom, how to do that safely, so that he doesn't shoot himself or anybody else. Incidentally, Bronks likes to shoot his gun that way I said, that's not good, cops are just gonna come out and hit you in the head. If you're gonna shoot, go that way. And if you wanna get some practice, go to a shooting range, $15, one hour. You can shoot as many targets as you like. Now, while Bronks is doing that, I get to talk to him. What is it about that target you like and we do the same thing we've just done here. And he'll tell me about what is it about that target, what is it about the gun, what is it about who. Now, maybe you don't have that extreme case, but that's the range that your two pictures work from, those two pictures you picked because they relate to you. If you can work with extreme clients in that picture, we'd tell you that. If you can work with clients that are doing well, those two pictures showed you your limitation as to what you can do or work with. Well, your clients will have the same thing. You just do this exercise with your client. You can go with your client and -- to a shooting range. Well, if you happen to be in Australia, you can get a McDonald's or work with them in your office. That's the two extremes of the clients that I've picked for you. Any other questions? And we'll head off -- we're doing great for time.

DAVE GOLDSMITH Yes. This is Frankston, Melbourne, Victoria. For those of you that are in the state, Frankston is a suburb out south from here. It's about an hour on the Frankston train. You can take the motorway, freeway, toll road, rest assured, you're looking at about 45 minutes to get there. It's a suburb on the coast, for those that are local, well, you know Frankston. 

00:54:25

00:54:30
DAVE GOLDSMITH The aims of the training program is really just to give you an introduction on how to work with children and mom and dad, adults. You have a choice. You can either be in the program that works with children or the program that works with mums. You pick the one you want. Unfortunately, there is only two facilitator positions for the parents and there's around six positions for working with children. These are just some of the aims. They have a website. It'll come up later with the web address. If you'd like to see me later, I can email you the whole package and this PowerPoint which give you all the information. Also I can email you a fly that has the details on it.

00:55:25
DAVE GOLDSMITH Basically the BTV program is a new initiative and they're looking at a different way of working with the same problem. They've worked out the -- when you work with children in domestic violence, you pretty much have a tough job unless you can get the parents unsigned. And so, it’s a holistic program where this works with, the parents are in one room, the children are in other room. You have a couple of hours that you work with them, there's a structured program that they work through, it runs one day a week for a couple of hours in night. At the end of the night, the children and the parents come together and they share what they have found. One of the great things about this program is because you work with the family, at the end of the night, they come together and they share what they've found. That's what makes this program very successful.

Task 5 

00:56:20
Can it be done without parents? 

00:56:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH For those that work with children, you'll now that it's a challenge. We work with children, turn up at the office, we get them for five minutes, ten minutes, 35, an hour, two hours, they head off direct to the parents, chances are they'll come back in the next week and you'll have the same problem. If you could work with the parents and children, it would make your job easier. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:56:55
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, we've got some time. I've got 20 minutes, and so I'd like you to take a look at this. Can it be done without parents? For those of you that work with children, can you do what you do without the parents involvement. Is it possible? And if it is possible, how can it can be done? Now, you can substitute, for those that don't work with children, maybe you can substitute children for youth, for adults, for young people and you can substitute the word parent for partner or somebody else. And I would like you just to take a couple of minutes, talk to your elbow friend about this. What would make your job easier? And can you do this without someone else's help. Take a couple of minutes, talk to your elbow friend, share what you got in your mind. You can relate this to yourself as a family person as a parent, if you don't wanna find the case file. For those of you sitting at home and watching this video, for those that are viewing this video, you can do the same thing. You can call a friend, Skype someone, do a chat. But I have got a lot time left. I've got 15 minutes and so I'll use those last 15 minutes and we'll do a final exercise. And then I'll save about five minutes for any questions, if you have any questions. What we're gonna do next is we're gonna use your two pictures that you've got, your two photographs. Now, while you still keeping talking to your elbow partner and is there any of your two pictures you'd like to swap with your elbow partner.

(Valzer, S (2011) Beyond the Violence, Anglicare Victoria, Australia) 

00:58:50
DAVE GOLDSMITH Take a look at those pictures. You're seeing your elbow partners pictures, are the any of those pictures you wanna change, swap over. If you like, you can take a couple of minutes, maybe come up and grab another kit, maybe there's a picture in there that you like. But also you don't need to change pictures if you want to, negotiate something with elbow partner or your group with your picture. Maybe there's a picture in there that you wanna swap. If you can ask your elbow partner, can I take that picture. If you happen to be sitting at home and watching this or watching this video, you can do the same thing. If you’re working with someone over the Internet, Skype, a chat, Facebook, maybe there's a picture of that that's at the other end that you wanna swap, you can do the same thing. While you're doing that, what you'll need is either you two original pictures or swap with your elbow partner, but I would like you to make sure that it's okay with your elbow partner that they're happy with the two pictures and you're happy with the two pictures. 

01:00:15
[sil.] 

01:00:20
DAVE GOLDSMITH Now, if you keep talking, what I'll tell you is lift the two pictures. Does everybody have one blank sheet of paper left? If you don’t, I have a couple of spares I can give you. But what you need to do is take your final sheet of paper and you'll be using that and I have some glue sticks up here that I'll hand down because you're gonna need to stick that picture to the top and the bottom. So work out the pictures you've got, move them around the sheet of paper, you'll need one at the top, one at the bottom. When I say top, anywhere at the top, anywhere at the bottom. Just so long as you have one at the top, one at the bottom. Does anybody need an extra sheet of paper? Now, if you continue to do that, keep talking with your elbow partner about that picture, what I'll do is I'll grab these glue sticks go up the aisle, hand them out. I want you to find a position on the sheet of paper for your picture you like and the sign for the picture that you're not that fussed on. So move those pictures around the sheet of paper, find out where you want, I'll hand out these glue sticks. When you get the glue stick, stick the picture to that sheet of paper wherever you want it. But you're gonna need a little bit of space between the two. Right. What we're gonna do, let's just see how we're going. We've got eight minutes, we've got plenty of time. We're doing well. Now, what you're gonna do next, this is your own personal message to you, what you're about to do. So if you don’t want your elbow partner to see it, you can give them a bit of space, if you wanna share with your elbow partner, you can feel free to do it. But this is a message to you that you're gonna write. The picture that you picked, the picture that you liked, that picture that you negotiated if you negotiated something with elbow partner, you picked it because you like it. And so, anywhere near that picture, write something about you, what is it about you like, maybe what is it about being at the ICIE for the last two days you've looked. What was it about the hotel that you liked? Is this something about this picture that you liked to? This is your own personal message to you. Now we can do this with our clients. You'll probably say this is a bit of motivational work and therapy. Your client can do the same thing. They can write a message to themselves. A reminder to say what they like about themselves, maybe there's something about that picture that you can see in you. If you're holding a picture that has a sign, nature, maybe it's something kind of that you see in yourself. Just write that. But that isn't what you're doing, what you're doing is you're accessing information in your right hemisphere and looking for an image or feeling something that gravitates. Obviously, your left will have no idea what it's doing, so your left is gonna control your hand, write down some information and the two are gonna share information between them. That’s what we have -- want our clients to do. We want them to share two pieces of information because once they share it and they give it to you, they share with you and you've got something to work with, you've got some data. Now, for those of you that have already worked well, but doing work at the bottom is gonna be something you don’t like. Now, if you don't wanna share this with your elbow partner, you can either hide it, write a couple of nights on the back. A reminder to fill this space, but you need to put something before you leave. For those that are watching this video, you can do the same thing. You just need to write something at the top and something at the bottom of whatever it is you're using. 

01:04:40
[sil.] 

01:05:10
DAVE GOLDSMITH So you now should have one sheet of paper with two pictures on it and a little message to yourself about what is this about, that top line you see in you and what is it about the bottom line you see. Now for those of you that are counselors that may be ten steps ahead of me, what do you do with this information. Well, it's just only a reminder to you about the beautiful people like you are. And at the bottom it's just saying, well, you know we have defects in there and we have things we have to work on, and there’s a blank space in the middle. For those of you that have a blank space in the middle, just write in there a message to yourself maybe about something you need to do. Something you need to do relevant to this one on the bottom. Maybe you need to get to more time with your family, maybe you need to go on a holiday, maybe the picture that you've stuck is a reminder to you of something you wanna do, maybe you wanna travel to the US, maybe you wanna travel to China, to Asia, to South America and maybe take a boat trip somewhere, a cruise, maybe go across and say hello to neighbor, maybe ring up a friend that you know, maybe a loved one, a family member that you haven’t seen, a brother or sister, an uncle or aunty, or members of wife, you, your mum, your dad, extended family. 

01:06:40
[sil.] 

01:06:45
DAVE GOLDSMITH We've got four minutes left, so we're doing well, you've got plenty of time to think about it. That’s in present to message to you, it's just a reminder of something you need to do. Now why are you doing that? I’ll just summarize and spend next the two minutes and just pull it altogether as they say to a summary and we are pretty much down for our morning. What we've done today is creativity. And as I mentioned, creativity has no rules, you can bend it, shape it, you can work it the way you want, you're an individual, you are special. So what you do and what your elbow partner does maybe two totally different things. Regardless, it makes no difference. Your elbow partner has a left to right hemisphere, same as you do, what you've done today is shared that information between the two. You've gone through your filing cabinet of images feelings sensations, That pictures that you've look at as brought for you. The going through left hemisphere, found some words in your picture on 50-80,000 found something that relates to it put to do two and by some magical why your left and right hemisphere has managed to do that in the last hour-and-a-half. Quite incredibly. And fortunately, our clients stated that same lecturing, now they stuck all the one and so this exercise simply as of way of how do you can get those to work, how can bring your back make them integrate and balanced, how they can work in harmony. Once again this exercise can be used anywhere. You're not need an office, you actually not need a kit, you can use anything in the environment. I’m standing here in front you, you can use this podium, the screen, the mirrors, the lights, the door, the sea. But crossing the five year the clothes you wear, what you have to do and it's find two things. Share that with your partner, share it with your co-worker, share it with your clients, the kids you work with, you can do this while you're walking, driving, sitting still, regardless what you doing is you need to find those images and then use the left brain to explain them. And that will give you something to work with. Now on that note, we're pretty much done unless you have any questions. For those of you that would like some of extra information, I've got some cards up here, I’ll give you the card, it has my email on it. And let's just go through -- this stuff here was all optional. So we were good for time. There you are, at the top there. That is my home number, my mobile, my email and my web address. If you go to that web address, you'll find some details, phone numbers, contacts, the usual things. Now, while you're doing that, does anybody have any questions before we close...
