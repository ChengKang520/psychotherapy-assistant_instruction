Nassar-McMillan, Ph.D. Julie Hakim-Larson, Ph.D. Sandra Amen-Bryan, M.A. Introduction 

00:00:00
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  I'm Dr. Sylvia Nassar-McMillan and I'm going to be introducing a video on Counseling Arab Americans Clinical Vignettes. By illustrating some possible interventions, we're going to invite you to join us in exploring mental health issues and treatment considerations in working with this population. Joining me are Dr. Julie Hakim-Larson and Sandra Amen-Bryan, a psychologist who will be serving as a therapist in each of the vignettes. In the vignettes, we'll be meeting members of a family, Miriam, the mother, Nadia, the teenage daughter and finally, Ali, the father. After each initial intervention, we'll have a brief discussion about counseling issues, treatment considerations, possible interventions and also cultural knowledge that would be helpful in treating this client or other clients from the Arab-American community. Finally, we'll have an overall discussion about family systems issues as well. Let's now go to the vignette of Miriam, the mother. 

00:01:35
Part I: Mother Clinical Vignette: Miriam 

00:01:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  So, Miriam now, now that we've gone over the, ah, consents for treatment, I've taken a health history and I've advised you of your rights. We could talk a little bit more now about exactly the situation or the problem that has brought you in to, to see me and if you can, ah, di, discuss your daughter's situation. So, can you, can you tell me what prompted this referral to a counselor? 

00:02:15
MIRIAM  Yes, ah, my daughter, Nadia, she is, ah, a tenth grader and I was called to school, ah, by her counselor. 

00:02:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
MIRIAM Uhm, I went in and he's very concerned. We're both concerned about her failing, uhm, school work. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
MIRIAM She's failing the tenth grade. 

00:02:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
MIRIAM Ah, she's not turning in assignments. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
MIRIAM  Uhm, sometimes she walks in late to the class... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
MIRIAM ...and I'm not sure why because, you know, we drop her at school on time. 

00:02:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:45
MIRIAM Uhm, and she made, ah, couple of statements to her counselor that she wishes to go to sleep and never wake up again. So, that really concerned the counselor and, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:55
MIRIAM  suggested that we see, ah, a therapist, (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:03:00
MIRIAM you know, perhaps we can, you know, workout some issues... (crosstalk) 

00:03:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
MIRIAM ...that we may have. 

00:03:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Okay. So, in regard to the, ah, statements that she made and I, and I agree those are serious statements. So, I, I think that was absolutely the right thing to do of the school counselor to pump that up to, ah, a higher level of intervention that, that they can't do in the school. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
MIRIAM Hmm. 

00:03:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Have you heard Nadia make any statements like that? Is she talking like that at home? 

00:03:30
MIRIAM  Nadia is a very selfish girl, you know. Sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:03:35
MIRIAM  she'll throw stuff at me just to get at me. 

00:03:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:03:40
MIRIAM Uhm, sometimes she'd say, "You know I wish if you weren't my mother, I wish if I was dead." You know, just say things... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

00:03:45
MIRIAM ...like this but a lot of teenager will say things like that. 

00:03:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. So, you're, you're thinking maybe she made the statement to the counselor for the shock value? 

00:03:55
MIRIAM  It's possible. It's possible. (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
MIRIAM I mean, she's, she's my daughter and I think she will say things like that. 

00:04:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Okay, and then you mention that she is not doing well in school. Now... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10

00:04:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

00:04:20

00:04:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:04:30

00:04:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

00:05:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Selfish, right. Okay. So, in, in what ways do you think Nadia is being selfish? 

00:05:50
MIRIAM I feel like she wants everything to be done her way. You tell her to do something one way. She turns around and does it, you know, in a completely the opposite. 

00:06:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:06:00

00:07:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

00:07:20

MIRIAM you know. There's a lot of things going on in this world. 

00:08:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
MIRIAM You know, I don't want my daughter to, to have that idea that it's okay for her. She's really young. She's only 15. 

00:08:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
MIRIAM You know, for her to go and sleep over her friend's house. You know, there is time for fun and there is time for family. You know, there is time for everything. 

00:08:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
MIRIAM  And with her it's like, it's a constant party. 

00:08:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. So, you see your daughter as somebody who is not taking her life too seriously or her, her school work or her responsibilities? 

00:08:30
MIRIAM Yes. She's actually, I find her to be very irresponsible, very irresponsible. She's, ah, sometimes she's been, ah, portrayed reckless behavior. I don't... (crosstalk)

00:08:40
MIRIAM ...approve of it. (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
MIRIAM You know, young ladies her age shouldn't be doing that. 

00:08:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. I know you mentioned before that you also tend to argue with her because you want her to participate with certain activities with you. For example going to the mosque. 

00:09:00
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:09:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And you, you started to tell me why she resents doing that and why she gives you, that as, as you said a hard time about going. Can you tell me more about that? 

00:09:10
MIRIAM You know, I'm not a, a, you know, ah, religious. I'm not really fanatic. But there are certain things that I'd like us to do as a family. 

00:09:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
MIRIAM Ah, I am a Muslim. And that's how I raised my children. I've always taken them to the mosque every Sunday. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
MIRIAM we used to go together as a family. Uhm, I know my husband sometimes, uhm, you know, he doesn't. I don't know it but I shouldn't say he doesn't see the value in that but he's got other things to do on a Sunday, so he doesn't join us but always... (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:45
MIRIAM ...me and the children. Ah, since they were little, we'll go to the mosque on Sunday. 

00:09:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
MIRIAM And uhm, Nadia, when she got to be, you know, a certain age, ah, to 12, we'll go to the mosque. And, ah, one of the things that you need to do is that to put a cover on your head, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
MIRIAM when we walk in to the mosque. 

00:10:05

00:10:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
MIRIAM Uhm, it is expected of me as a Muslim to put it on when I walk in to a religious institution. 

00:10:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:10:20
MIRIAM And Nadia always fought me. She'll wait, ah, when we're in there. And when she sees that I'm not looking, she'll take it off. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
MIRIAM Just to despise me. She did, she was okay when she was 12 and 13 but now... (crosstalk)

00:10:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...it's like, it's a constant struggle with her. She don't wanna go with me. Uhm, she don't want to put on the scarf, you know. I'm always arguing with her, you know. We go in there, you know, she embarrasses me sometimes, (crosstalk)

00:10:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

MIRIAM ...and with all honesty, you know, I feel like, you know, I don't have control over the situation. You know, they all look up to me because I'm the oldest in the family and they come with their problems, with their own kids (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
MIRIAM ...and here I am, I have, you know, this teenager that I have no control over her. It really, it upsets me. It makes me angry... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

00:11:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  You sound very frustrated. 

00:11:25
MIRIAM I am. I'm very frustrated with that. 

00:11:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You, you sound frustrated on a, on a number of levels with the family situation. Not only with Nadia but some disagreements between yourself and your husband about how to approach your daughter's problems and the situation... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:11:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...she's at now? 

00:11:40

00:12:20
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:12:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So he, he didn't have the situation of having a younger sister... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
MIRIAM Right. 

00:12:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...to feel protective over like he's, like he's old. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
MIRIAM They're, they're all older than him. That's true and actually, they spoiled him.

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And it, it, it sounds like you are really worried about Nadia. And if you give her a little bit more freedom now that, ah, this is what is going to happen. 

00:15:10
MIRIAM Yeah. 

00:15:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

00:15:10
MIRIAM Yeah. 

00:15:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And I know, I know one of your complaints is that she's on the phone a lot. And, and I, I... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
MIRIAM Yeah. 

00:15:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...know you're concerned about exactly who, who she is talking to? 

00:15:20
MIRIAM  Yes. I, you know, even though when I asked her, "Who are you talking to?" She'll come up with an excuse. "I'm talking to so and so." But deep down I feel that she's talking to boys. 

00:15:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
MIRIAM And, uhm, you know, even when I took the phone away from her, you know. Her father (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
MIRIAM ...doesn't help the situation. 

00:15:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
MIRIAM Ah, he's still, you know, gives her his phone... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
MIRIAM ...especially when she goes out with her friends. I'm not so much opposed that he gives her the phone when she goes out with her, with her friends because I need to know where's she's at. But if she is being disciplined, he needs to respect that. 

00:15:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
MIRIAM And he needs to understand that if I took something away from her... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
MIRIAM ...that he shouldn't, you know, behind my back, give her access to his phone. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. So, you feel like he's... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
MIRIAM So. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...interfering... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
MIRIAM Yes, he's. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...a little bit too much. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
MIRIAM Yes. And I'd like him, you know. He was, he was pretty strict with the boys though... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
MIRIAM ...I, I must admit but he's not with her. 

00:16:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
MIRIAM He's not with her. I feel like it should be the other way around, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
MIRIAM He should be more strict with her, you know, and may be less strict with the boys but, (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
MIRIAM you know, he's not helping the situation. 

00:16:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN It sounds like he took a more active role with the boys in terms of their sports. 

00:16:30
MIRIAM Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I know you've mentioned before how involved he has been and he has... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
MIRIAM Yeah. 

00:16:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...never missed one of their games. And, and this seems to be a real bond between himself and, and the boys. 

00:16:40
MIRIAM I think so. I think it because sometimes he doesn't know how to deal with my daughter. 

00:16:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
MIRIAM And the only way he deals with her is just by giving her or giving into her. 

00:16:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

00:16:50
MIRIAM  Ah, and, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
MIRIAM I, I understand that. I understand that it's his daughter and he wants to spoil her and all of that. But I, I think he needs to set some boundaries for her. 

00:17:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
MIRIAM And he's not doing that and I think that's gonna hurt her more... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
MIRIAM  than to just, you know, ah, to give in to her all the time. Because... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
MIRIAM ...she's playing us against each other. And... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
MIRIAM ...he can't see that. 

00:17:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  It sounds like you have really thought about this situation. You really make some excellent points about your daughter and you've obviously given this a lot of thought, particularly in terms of your husband and your and, ah, what, what you think are his feelings about her, that he, he really may be at loss as to how to approach her. He knows what worked for his boys. But he seems to be uncertain about how to handle his teenage daughter other than to give in to her and, uhm, allow her to, ah, kind of ma, ma, manipulate him and maybe manipulate, ah, the, the two of you against each other. And this is, this is kind of typical adolescent behavior that we see. But, in this situation, it sounds like it has really reached, ah, a, a bit of a crisis in the family, particularly... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
MIRIAM  Yes. 

00:18:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...as Nadia is really expressing her own frustrations. She is making comments, (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
MIRIAM Yeah. 

00:18:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN has made comments both to you and the school counselor. " I wish I was dead." She is, uhm, she seems to be at a loss herself as to how to handle some problems that she's having at school as well as... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:18:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...several of these cultural issues that are coming up at home. Ah, I understand what you're saying. She wants, uhm, she wants a particular level of freedom that according to your cultural and religious standards, is just not appropriate for a girl to have. And she seems to not be accepting that. 

00:19:05
MIRIAM I mean, I'm, I'm really concerned about this because, she, you know, even for me to take her out of school, that's not what I have hoped for her. But if this continues, you know, what other options do I have? I may want to take her out of school and just, you know, find a young man for her and, and, you know, play the matchmaker and, and, and get her... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
MIRIAM ...married. You know, a lot of young girls, they'll do probably better being married and just, just at home. Of course, I'm not, I won't feel comfortable and it would be probably another argument at home if she ever said, "Oh, I wanna go to college and go away." Like her brother did, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
MIRIAM I don't know what to do with that situation if that... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

00:19:50
MIRIAM ...ever was to surface. But I really, if this continues, I have no choice but to even, you know, just drop her out of her school, keep her home and probably get her married. 

00:20:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, you are ah, so that, that, tells me you are really... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
MIRIAM I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...feeling a... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:20:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...level of desperation here. 

00:20:05
MIRIAM Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Because I, I know you value education. I know you worked very hard to attend school for, attend college for two... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
MIRIAM Yes. 

00:20:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...years before you were married. And, and, ah, I, I know you worked very hard in the bank. You're, you're, you are a, ah, well-respected and valued employee. So you must, (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
MIRIAM  Thank you. 

00:20:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ah, you must be quite, quite desperate now as, as a mother to be considering that. 

00:20:35
MIRIAM I mean, honest, I, I have spent my life, I, I given, and willingly, I've given up my own, my own ambition, my only, my own career, just so I could take care of my family, you know. This is not what I had hoped for my daughter. Ah, to see her throw away all these opportunities that, (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
MIRIAM you know, that she has got, really frustrates me and makes... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
MIRIAM ...me very upset. Like you said, I, I have turned out, turned down, uhm, a lot of opportunities... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
MIRIAM  at work because it involved traveling, leaving my family for extended, extended, ah, period of time. 

00:21:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
MIRIAM And I didn't wanna do this. Why? (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
MIRIAM Because of my children. 

00:21:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
MIRIAM  They're my life. 

00:21:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
MIRIAM But she's not making things easy for me. I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
MIRIAM ...ah, there's, right now, it(ph) a lot of tension at home. 

00:21:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
MIRIAM We argue all the time, me and her father. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
MIRIAM Ah, she and her brothers. And it's like, you know, this is constant, and it's, (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
MIRIAM it's really becoming unbearable, I, (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
MIRIAM it's frustrating to me. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. I hear that. Okay, well, Miriam, I thank you so much for your time. I, I have Nadia scheduled for next week. So, I thought it would be a good idea for me to meet, meet with you first. I always like to meet with my parents first and get some background information. And, try to understand from their viewpoint as to what's going on. So, I'm going to, ah, bring Nadia and, a, alone. And ah, see if she will talk to me about these situations that are going on because, you know, we don't, we don't wanna see her flunk out of school. You, you really have, a, a wonderful family. And, ah, you're a very, very dedicated, ah, mother and wife, and so, you know, we're going to do everything we can do to help get her back on track. And bring back some stability and peace in your home. 

00:22:30
MIRIAM I hope so, I hope so. Thank you. 

00:22:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And then once I, once I talk to Nadia, and, ah, I, I know you said your husband couldn't make it today. So, I'm expecting a callback from him. He, he said he would, ah, he would schedule with me alone. So, now that I have heard your side about the, the difficult situations at home, uhm, my, my plan is to, is to try to discuss some of these situations also. And that we will come back together as a family and see if we can come to some agreements and, ah, help, help your daughter get back on track. Okay? (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
MIRIAM Okay, thank you. 

00:23:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

00:23:15
Clinical Discussion: Miriam 

00:23:15
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN  In considering the vignette we have just watched with Sandra, working with Miriam the, the mother in the family unit, uhm, let's consider the four questions in terms of analyzing the, the case. 

00:23:45
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON What are the primary mental health issues affecting Miriam? 

00:23:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Well, in terms of mental health and the way that I would approach her, one, one of the issues that was very clear is the need for some parenting education and counseling. 

00:24:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, this is a mother who is very frustrated. And she is not in, at the point where she is able to negotiate with her adolescent daughter very much. 

00:24:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON So, one of the problems here would be intergenerational conflict, conflict between one generation and the other. 

00:24:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

00:24:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. Okay, and that's also part of like an acculturation kind of problem, would you say? 

00:24:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Well, this, this mother is having issues on a number of levels. 

00:24:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN That are all that, uhm, that are all acting on her at the same time, these intergenerational cultural issues, again, as well as these parenting issues because her, her approach is just to say to her daughter, ah, "Do it because I say so." 

00:24:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Like for example, when the daughter asked her, "Why can I not spend the night?," she said, "Because I said no." 

00:25:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And she really was not discussing anything with her. 

00:25:05
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, the, this parent is, is taking a, a very authoritarian role with her daughter, regardless of what these cultural issues are. But with this mother, we have these additional layers of cultural issues that are reinforcing her very traditional way of dealing with her daughter. 

00:25:25
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Would you say that, that's rather common with first and second generation families as compared with maybe later generations like third and fourth, where the parents take such a strict role? 

00:25:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I would say the authoritarian approach would be more common with the newer generations. 

00:25:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN But again for every statement we can make, we have to remember that my comments are in reference to this particular situation. So, this mother is, is taking that approach, whereas another parent from the same situation, as we just saw me take a different approach. 

00:26:10
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN The other thing too, to remember is that, that if she had been from a different country of origin, (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Hmm. 

00:26:15
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN maybe one that, that were more influenced by Western values or less influenced by Western values... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...it would matter with the way impact her way of being as a parent as well. 

00:26:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN And I think the other, uhm, issue is that, that she seems to view the, the need for the daughter to behave in a certain way as essential to the, the well-being of the family structure. 

00:26:45
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Okay. And how, what would you (inaudible ) some of the treatment goals that you would try and set, ah, in this kind of a situation for this mother? 

00:26:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN One of the treatment goals after, our, or in, in addition to the parenting would be some psychoeducation approaches in terms of culture. I think, ah, ah, a cognitive behavioral approach with this mother... (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...would also be effective. 

00:27:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Even though she's very acculturated. She tends to be ambitious, she's energetic. She is, uhm, you know, capable and, and, ah, a, already has good, good insight. 

00:27:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, this mother already made the remark to me that, for example, her husband tend, tends to feel a, a little intimidated when it comes to dealing with his daughter. He's really not sure how to deal with her. So, he, he tends to take this approach. So, this mother has given the, the situation a lot of thought. 

00:27:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And so, I would wanna further her level of, of insight. 

00:27:55
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN And she also seemed very willing to express her emotions. She mentioned that she was frustrated at times... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...or, uhm, worried about shame, ah, in the family, uhm, seemed willing to discuss the affect of... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Great. The emotional involvements, (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...the emotional issues, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON right? So, in terms of treatment interventions done, (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Hmm. 

00:28:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ah, do you take a psychoeducational approach and maybe a cognitive behavioral approach... (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ...or, what, ah, what approach is do you think would be suitable here? 

00:28:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Well, for, for this mother in, in particular, she, she really needs support. 

00:28:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So this is a person who has an awful lot of responsibility on her shoulder. She is, she has a lot of burden. 

00:28:40
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And I did not hear her make references to, for example, talking with her sisters, or neighbor, or friends. 

00:28:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, I, I had the feeling that this mother has a lot of her feelings really bottled up. 

00:28:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And whenever there are stressors, a lot of these frustration just comes rolling out for her because she sounds like she doesn't have the support of her husband or her husband is really interfering a little bit in terms of how she's approaching her daughter. So, this, this mother needs someone who she feels under, understands... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  the situation that she's in. 

00:29:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON I know for, for many families who are recent, more recently immigrated, there are some, they don't have a lot of support because family... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ...is still left back in the old country. 

00:29:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Right? Uhm, and (inaudible ) may would be very difficult that in terms of making new friends and... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ...got any, ah, support. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN But in addition, in, in addition to that, uhm, I think that we did hear, that the grandparents who were here on the same, you know, in living a community, (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN but in, in another way, uhm, for some families that could add to the intergenerational conflict... 

00:29:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...because although they certainly would understand the culture, we don't really know how supportive they can... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...be because they might, in fact, be encouraging her to become more strict or, you know, sort of, even in some ways add to the conflict. 

00:30:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I, I think that's a very real possibility... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Right. 

00:30:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  for this family... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...because, uhm, well, Miriam has a mother who is very dependent on her. And it sounds like that pattern had been set up from a number of years ago. 

00:30:25
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  I see. 

00:30:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, I think it, it's really adding to, to her burden and, ah, I, I think you're right in terms of affecting her approach with, with her daughter. 

00:30:40
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON What kinds of things do you see as being helpful in terms of having an understanding of Arabic culture, ah, for your work with Miriam? 

00:30:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. You know, for Miriam and her family, if, ah, somebody didn't really have some background and some real good understanding of the, the very complex cultural issues that had got presented in this situation, I, I think somebody would have such a difficult time intervening. So, my, my background and my knowledge is going to help in terms of understanding the gender roles, understanding the expectations, understanding the influence of the ideas of, ah, shame and how those get translated and, and how these ideas get interpreted with, within the family. Also, in terms of, ah, ah, Miriam's, ah, e, e, expectations, her feeling of needing to maintain her role in the family, her concern about being embarrassed in front of her parents, in front of her siblings. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So these are ideas that really need to be appreciated when you're, you're trying to intervene with this family. 

00:32:05
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN It also seems like your, you know, you mentioned this a few times and we certainly know this from are own, all of our work with multicultural clients and issues that you can't generalize this particular case... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...and assume that every other person would, uhm, would benefit from the same kind of intervention or the same kind of interpretation... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Or respond which... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...of presenting the issues. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ...is the same way. 

00:32:30
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Or respond on the same grade, in the same way, right. But, Miriam who(ph) had very strong ideas... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...very specific ideas. But, I could have a parent in the next day who might come from a very similar background and their approach to their children would be very different. 

00:32:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, while it's good to keep these general ideas on your mind, the challenge then, is to see everybody as, as an individual. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, it really gets to be a, a constant balancing act for the, ah, for the therapist who is trying to intervene and certainly that is very true even when you are from the same background and the same ethnicity and the same religious identity. 

00:33:20
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You know, even, even for someone like me, it is a constant balancing act because my ideas about family and, uhm, gender roles may be very different, (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  even if they're similar to the person that I'm dealing with, (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN they are still not exactly me... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and I have to figure out how to put myself in their shoes, at their level and take into consideration their unique life... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and how, how can I help them, how can I be of service to them without promoting my, my own ideas with this family. 

00:34:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Exactly. Hmm. 

00:34:05
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN I'd like to admit one last point about how somebody's cultural background and or their knowledge about the culture, ah, really is important in terms of a, a, appropriately interpreting issues such as family shame, (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ah, somebody might say, "Well, I, I, I know that Arab-American culture or Arab culture, you know, has this element of shame. And it's used to control, ah, one of the family or maybe in particular within mother and daughter dynamics." (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN But, uhm, but in fact, you know, and that, being part of that maybe true but there's also an additional component of everybody in the family is a collectivistic culture and everybody in the family... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...has to maintain, you know, specific, sort of prescribed roles within the family and keep... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...the family structure intact. And so, so it's important to, uhm, I think to have that cultural awareness to be able to balance, ah, multiple perspectives on, on the dynamics that clients present. 

00:35:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And I'm, I'll just add one more point to the idea of the shame. In, in this, in this instance we saw, where shame was being utilized as, as a form of some control but it is also the bridge by which this family maintains its pride. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, so the sha, the shame is also being used as a, as a social standard to enforce values such as education. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, this is one of the reasons why Miriam is having a problem with her daughter, because Miriam does value education, she sees that her daughter is just fluffing this off. (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:35:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And this is not something that this mother feels good about. She loves her daughter to be educated. 

00:35:55
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN Okay. Well, let's take a look at the next vignette... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  So, Nadia thanks for coming in. And ah, you know, I've, I've already spoken with your mother. I usually talk with my parents first 'coz I get some background information from them and some health information about why you know, when kids are small and it's usually kind of, kind of boring for the, for the, ah, young person to be part of that first session. So, your mom came in and we had a chance to talk a little bit. And, ah, I, I know that you were referred by the school counselor. So, they have some concerns about what's going on with you at school. But I, I wanted to hear from you as to why, why you think you're here and, ah, what's, what's going on? So, can you, can you tell me a little bit about your, ah, your school performance right now?

00:37:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
NADIA My, my teachers like me 'coz I don't cause trouble. 

00:38:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. I'm glad that (inaudible ). So, you, you said you're not failing. Now, when your school counselor called she seemed to have a different idea about that. Now, what, ah, what, what has the school told you about your credits and, and how you're performing? 

00:38:20
NADIA I don't know. I had a feeling like, like my mom is just talking to them, 'coz she's scared that like, I don't know, I'm not getting good grades and I guess I'm not doing as well as I could.

00:41:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
NADIA She doesn't have to make me do everything she does. She's her own person and I'm my own person. And my mother doesn't seem to have a problem with that. So why does she?

NADIA And stuff like that. And, it kind of scares me like, (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:47:25
NADIA but, I don't know if she really would do it. But it's, it's scary I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
NADIA I don't wanna get married. (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
NADIA Why do I wanna get married? I'm only 15. 

00:47:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. Uh hmm. So, it's, it's not a real fear on your part. But it, it's, it sounds like you know she's, she's trying to get your attention right now by making these statements and it sounds like she's also pretty frustrated too with, with what's going on. And she's not, she's not really sure what to do or, or what to say right now. 

00:47:55
NADIA  Yeah. I don't know. I mean, she could do it. I have other friends in my neighborhood that like their parents tell them the same thing like, "Oh, (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
NADIA do you wanna go get married? You're gonna, if you don't wanna go to school and get good grades then might... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
NADIA ...as well we just marry you off." Like, "Okay, is that all... (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
NADIA ...I'm good for? I'm just born to get married and have babies?" I don't wanna live like that, you know. 

00:48:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
NADIA I just want a chance to know Nadia. 

00:48:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
NADIA That's it. 

00:48:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
NADIA And, and my mom, she's like always, like she's always over my head like, "Do this, do that." "Why can't you be more like me?" Well, I don't wanna be like my mom, like in everything, do you know what I mean? (crosstalk) 

00:48:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:35
NADIA I like my mom and she's a great person. But I, it doesn't mean that I have to be like her. Like she always says, "Oh, the culture, the Arab culture we're like this, we're like that. And, (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
NADIA and "You have to respect the, the rules of the mosque when you go in." And yes sometimes I do take my scarf off. I don't, I don't wanna keep wearing that at the time. And... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
NADIA I don't know. I mean, it messes my hair up sometimes. Like I'll have my hair done and we'll, we'll go and I have to like go to the bathroom and fix it up and I don't know. 'Coz my friends look at the mirror and like, "How can you wear it at the mosque and not outside?" (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:49:10
NADIA And I feel, I feel like a hypocrite. 

00:49:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. Well, Nadia it sounds like you're having a hard time finding exactly where you do belong. You're not exactly comfortable in the mosque situation. It sounds like you don't have friends who really go or participate in that. And you're having a hard time finding your place at home even and, and including school. I, I haven't heard that you're involved in any activities at school. Is there a reason for that? Is there, is it that you're not interested in school activities or do you feel like your parents maybe, your mom in particular, is just not encouraging you to, to do anything or maybe she doesn't allow you to do this? 

00:50:00
NADIA It's weird because sometimes I feel like my mom, she's really loving and open but then like other times, she's just as, I don't wanna say mean, but like she's... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
NADIA ...just as, uhm, strict, you know. And, and it's, it's confusing to me like she doesn't really encourage me and either does my dad really, like to be involved in sports but my... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
NADIA ...brothers, they were encouraged like, you know, he constantly go to their games and, and they would be in camp during the summer to like to improve their skills and stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
NADIA  I don't know, I guess they just never really thought I should be in sports. (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
NADIA My mom is always saying, "You should stay at home." (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
NADIA So why, I don't know. 

00:50:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
NADIA 'Coz my friends are really not into sports that much either. So, (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
NADIA  we don't, I mean, like, I tried to go, uhm, somebody asked me out to the prom... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
NADIA ...and he's an older guy... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
NADIA ...and my mom said, "No. If you don't go with your brother, you can't go with anyone and you just won't go at all." (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh-huh. 

00:51:05
NADIA And then she always tells my brothers like, my older brother, that's a senior, she was always like, "Oh, watch out for her in the hallways in the high school and make sure that nobody like talks to her and she doesn't talk to boys and stuff like that." Like, okay, I have two parents, I need another one? (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:51:20
NADIA He know what I mean, it's just, that's annoying. 

00:51:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So you've got your brother at school keeping an eye on you and, yeah, you feel like he's bossing you around always, (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
NADIA Yeah. But he's not... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN always there? 

00:51:30
NADIA ...the boss of me, you know. 

00:51:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
NADIA That's why I have my mom and dad who are already strict enough. 

00:51:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
NADIA  And then, I see him with girls in the hallway any ways. He's always like, he thinks he's so cool. Like, "Oh, did you know that, uhm, Stephanie(ph)," who's like this really popular girl, whatever like. She's... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
NADIA ...really pretty and all the guys, I don't know. They just like her. 

00:51:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
NADIA He's like, "Oh, Stephanie(ph) told somebody that she thinks I'm hot, you know. 

00:51:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
NADIA She thinks... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh-huh. 

00:51:55
NADIA ...I'm cool 'coz I play all these sport and whatever." 

00:52:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:52:00
NADIA Like if somebody were to say that about me, he would like, "Oh, my sister is like, she's bad," I would have a bad reputation for it. 

00:52:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Yeah. He have a fit, right? (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
NADIA Yeah. He would be like, "Oh, my God! Nobody could talk about my sister like that." You know. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

00:52:10
NADIA But with him, it's cool that all these girls like him. And it's cool that I come and tell him, " All my friends think you're cute. My friends think you're hot." He gets, he gets a cake out of it. He's weird. 

00:52:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Yeah. Older brothers are like that. I, I, I went, I went through that too with my older brothers because I, I, I had one when I was in school but too. And sometimes, it was cool because if there was a boy bothering me, I could get my big brother after him. But then, I also went through some of what you're going through too and that, that they really keep an eye on you. So they know who are your friends are... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
NADIA Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and they know who are the guys are that want to talk to you. (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
NADIA Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And, ah, you know, they're, they're going to let you know who they approve of and who they don't approve of. And you know, and it comes to me, your big brother really means a lot. 

00:53:00
NADIA I like my brothers like and I like that my friends like them. And they're cool and that we get to go places and people think that we're, we're cool, you know, and I mean, I like that. But... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
NADIA ...they don't really see what goes on in our house. They think... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
NADIA  like everything get so perfect on the outside. I mean, they don't see like how my parents have been arguing so much and I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
NADIA ...even scared that they might get a divorce like my other friend. 

00:53:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
NADIA  I don't know if, I hope they don't ever have to... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
NADIA ...go through that and that's kind of scary like... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35

00:53:35
NADIA ...to think, you know, that my family... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

00:53:35
NADIA ...could change that way. 

00:53:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Alright. You don't wanna, you don't wanna see them separate and, and, ah, just the thought of that really scares you. (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
NADIA Plus, imagine what my mom's family would say, 'coz she's like the oldest sibling and... (crosstalk) 

00:53:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:53:50

00:54:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

NADIA ...how are we gonna solve this?" And she feels like, I think she feels a lot of pressure. 

00:54:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
NADIA And then sometimes, she puts that pressure on us like you have to be perfect, (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
NADIA people speak English all the time. Why is that such a big deal? 

00:54:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Right. And your, your ma, your mom has a lot of responsibilities for her family. So she maybe expressing her frustration to you and, and the rest of the family members. 

00:55:00

00:55:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
NADIA Like I love my mom and, and I know that she has other people to take care of but our, our family comes first and, (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm.

00:55:20
NADIA If I'm not the way she wants me to be, (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
NADIA which by the way, it means that I have to be like her... (crosstalk) 

00:55:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:30
NADIA ...or else I'm not good enough, and then, something is wrong.

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Is that how you feel that, that's, (crosstalk)

And uhm, I, I think your parents should know really how you feel. So ne, next week, we will schedule another appointment and meet as a group and, and discuss some of these issues further and see if we can't ah, meet in the middle as, as a family. And for each one to express how they feel and see if we can get some agreement on, on some of these issues. 'Coz, you know, you're, you're really well, well loved by your family and you, you really do have an awesome family and, and, I, I wanna see you be a good student like I, I think you wanna be, too.

00:59:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:59:25
NADIA You know, like when you're feeling something and you are already upset and then other people say and do things to you that like uhm, it piles up, and you feel like, (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
NADIA "Oh, my God. I just can't take it anymore." You know what? (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm, hmm, hmm. 

00:59:40
NADIA I don't think I really meant it. I mean, I didn't really mean it. It's just... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:59:40
NADIA  something that you say, you know and. (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. You said that because you were mad? 

00:59:50
NADIA Yeah. I was really mad, and like hurt and just frustrated with my family and, (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

00:59:55
NADIA just with how, like I said, my parents have been arguing and stuff, but ah, I, I have never thought about like killing myself for real. I think why I have, (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:00:05
NADIA I would never do that. 

01:00:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You wouldn't? 

01:00:05
NADIA No. 

01:00:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm, hmm. 

01:00:05
NADIA No, I, I don't have any reason to do that. I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
NADIA I hear about that all the times like... (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
NADIA  young kids doing things, or like taking drugs. I know it's stupid. I would never do things like that. 

01:00:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
NADIA No. (crosstalk) 

01:00:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You just can't you see yourself taking any action like that against yourself? 

01:00:20
NADIA  No. 

01:00:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
NADIA No. 

01:00:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Okay. 

01:00:25
Clinical Discussion: Nadia 

01:00:25
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  With respect to ah, treatment approaches, uhm, therapy... (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:00:45
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON ...interventions, what do you see is being, ah, what would you like possibly use with Nadia? 

01:00:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Well, Nadia is, eh, is really having a difficult time at this point. She is not comfortable at home. She is not doing well at school. She is coming overloaded with frustration. So, for a person like Nadia, I really would wanna monitor her. So, I, I need to meet with her regularly. I would say over the next couple of months, I, at least every couple of weeks. And I wo, would also want to bring in the, ah, school personnel or school counselor to help in that monitoring. Nadia has made a pretty serious statement, something in relation to wanting to die, not wanting to live, something like that. Nadia is minimizing that, but we need to make sure that she has the coping skills to deal with whatever additional frustrations are going to be coming down the pipe for her. So, treatment approaches to continue to monitor her, I would also hope to meet even with ah, her friends to include this social circle to see, you know, where, where the, where the friends are in terms of their academic achievement and, and their social activities. Because whatever is going on with them is what Nadia is going and want to do. And so, we need to work to begin to solicit Nadia's cooperation because she's, she's saying no now to a lot of things. 

01:02:30
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. So, what background, uhm, cultural information about Arab-Americans do you think would be helpful in, ah, to a therapist in working with Nadia? 

01:02:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You know, un, understanding some of these family roles, like for example, one of Nadia's big complaints is how the brother keeps an eye on her in school. And, I disclosed to Nadia, I was on that same situation at one point. (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And so, the, the relevant ah, background information is to help Nadia nor, normalize these, these situations to help her understand she's not the only person or she's, she's not the only young woman kind of caught up on these conflicts, that these are experiences that many young women like her might, might go through, because Nadia is feeling very isolated. 

01:03:30
 Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, she needs to understand her experiences within a larger context. 

01:03:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And so, the self-disclosure was done to help her normalize the situations in her mind and, and to help develop that bond and that rapport with her. 

01:03:50
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN I would also think that in working with your client, with Nadia in particular, that uhm, she, she clearly is struggling with the whole issue of ethnic identity... (crosstalk) 

01:04:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:00
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...and where she fits in in terms of Arab-American culture, Arab culture, American culture. (crosstalk) 

01:04:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uhm, she feels hypocritical a lot of times. (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN She mentioned, you know, wearing like hijab and going into Masjid or, or Mosque versus not outside. I'm sure she sees... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:15
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...some of her peers wearing hijabs, some not, her mother doesn't. I think, (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:20
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN you know, a lot of those issues seemed to be sort of confusing her. (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN And I would, well, I wouldn't put those as predominant issues about certainly her mental, mental functioning or academics or issues... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:35
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...like that. It seems like those would be really relevant issues... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:04:35
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...where the cultural... (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:40
SYLVIA NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...background and, or knowledge would really become helpful. 

01:04:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Ah, those are very relevant issues for Nadia and there are complicating issues because she's a, she's a 15-year-old young woman who is trying to figure out who she is, period. (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
 Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And she's trying to figure this suddenly in the context of her family situation and in the, the context of the larger social requirement. So, so, Nadia is trying to figure out a lot of things for herself right now. 

01:05:10
 Uh hmm. 

01:05:10
SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Okay. Let's now take a look at the vignette of Sandra working with Ali, the father.

01:05:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
ALI I find it impossible to timing my schedule to, (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
ALI to make it in here, uh hmm. 

01:05:55

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
ALI Ah, you know, I, I've been doing that for ah, about 15 years now. 

01:06:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm, impressive for you. I know you haven't, you have a quite a reputation in the community. 

01:06:25
ALI Well, I, I like to think I have a good one. Ah, (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
ALI and ah, it don't, pretty well, a good thing with the community. 

01:06:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Yeah, that's impressive. So, Ali, I've, I, I've talked with your wife and I have, (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I've also met with your daughter, Nadia. (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  You, you really, you really have a nice family. 

01:06:45
ALI Thank you. 

01:06:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. And I've, I've really heard some ah, very impressive things about your two oldest sons also. I, I haven't met them but ah, they, they seemed like they're quite high achievers and I'm, I'm sure you're very proud of them. 

01:07:00
ALI Yeah, I, I, I am. They're, ah, uhm, the, they're doing very well in both in their school work. They're both involved in the sports activities ah, (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:10
ALI ...after school. Ah, the kids were more busy which is a good thing. (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:15
ALI And ah, (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN (inaudible ) 

01:07:17
ALI they're doing very well, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:07:17
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:17
ALI And probably part of the problem is because... (crosstalk) 

01:07:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:20
ALI ...if they're, after school, the activities in sports thing(ph), (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
ALI I can't spend more time with them... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
ALI ...and, and I go with Nadia. 

01:07:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. They, they keep you busy. And I, I know you've had a closed hand with them. 

01:07:30
ALI Yeah. 

01:07:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Well, today, we're here to talk about Nadia... (crosstalk) 

01:07:35
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:07:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and, ah, she was, she was referred to the agency by her school counselor, (crosstalk) 

01:07:40
ALI Hmm. (clears throat) 

01:07:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  and, you know, a, a, as you know they were quite concerned. Apparently, there was an argument between herself with her brother, and apparently, Nadia being, maybe a little bit emotional when she spoke with the, with the ah, school counselor. She mentioned something about, you know, wanting to die or something in reference to that. Now, Nadia really minimized this when I spoke with her. So, I, I, I didn't think it was really any kind of a serious threat. 

01:08:15
ALI Well, I, I have, well, I have to tell you that when I found out, you know, I'm, (crosstalk) 

01:08:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:08:20
ALI ...I'm, I was shocked (inaudible ). 

01:08:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:08:25
ALI I had no idea that these kinds of things were running through her mind. And, ah, uhm, ah, I, I don't wanna minimize it and... (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
ALI I, I, I I don't wanna over blow it, but if she is... (crosstalk) 

01:08:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:08:35
ALI ...have, having fleeting thoughts of that hatred, (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
ALI and that's, it's something that has to be dealt with absolutely. (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. So, you're, you're rightly concerned about that. 

01:08:45
ALI I'm very much so. 

01:08:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Now, ha, from, ah, from your side, do you know if Nadia has ever made any of these actions or taken, taken any steps in this direction? 

01:08:55
ALI Ah, I'm quite sure that she hasn't but, (crosstalk) 

01:09:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:00
ALI ...ah, or I'm gonna say if she's had those kinds of thoughts in her mind, it's, ah, ah, I wanna... (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:05
ALI ...uhm, do something about it now... (crosstalk) 

01:09:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:10
ALI ...as oppose to waiting, waiting around. 

01:09:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. Hmm. 

01:09:10
ALI  If that should ah, you know, if the situation should ah, get worst and she... (crosstalk) 

01:09:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:20
ALI ...and these thoughts become more serious, (crosstalk) 

01:09:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:20
ALI  I'm gonna be able to step in now whether it's me or her mother or... (crosstalk) 

01:09:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:09:25
ALI ...help from a therapist... (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
ALI ...to find out exactly what the problem is. (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Well, my, my plan with her at this point is to continue to see her. But I, I wanted to meet with, ah, with her parents to get some background information... (crosstalk) 

01:09:45
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:09:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and uhm, to, to un, to understand from your side, you know, what, what really emotional atmosphere is in the family right now. Now, my, my role is not to meet with my, with my young people and report back to their parents as to exactly what, what they said, because that, that is not a good way to try to ensure anyone's confidentiality but... (crosstalk) 

01:10:10
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:10:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...I, I, I do wanna relate to you that Nadia feels like a great deal of frustration at home. And she, frankly, she is concerned because she, she did mentioned that uhm, you, you and her mother are arguing a lot and she indicated there's a high level of stress at home. So, I'm, I'm wondering if you can give me some insight about really what's going on. 

01:10:35
ALI Well, certainly that is the case. Hmm, ah, the home environment is very stressful and... (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
ALI ...I'm sure a lot of that has to do with, with me. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
ALI  back about six months ago, I was on a business flight. I was flying off to Washington D.C. 

01:10:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
ALI And ah, everybody boarded to the plane, and actually, pulled away from the, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
ALI the gates. (crosstalk) 

01:11:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:11:05
ALI And you know, plane stops... (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:11:10
ALI ...and for some reason, the gate of the plane pulled back up to the gate again... (crosstalk) 

01:11:12
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:12
ALI ...and, ah, door was opened up, and a couple of uniformed police officers... (crosstalk) 

01:11:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:11:20
ALI ...got in the plane looking back to where I was sitting, (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:20
ALI  and asked me to get off the plane. 

01:11:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:25
ALI I had no idea why or where they will be taking me off the airplane but that's... (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
ALI ...exactly what they did. They escorted me off the airplane, (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
ALI  walked me back through the terminal area. (crosstalk) 

01:11:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:40
ALI Ah, and I can't put into words what a humiliating experience... (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:50
ALI ...that was. (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:50
ALI Ah, we're finding out of the airport here, and my greatest fear was that somebody was gonna see me being escorted ah, through the, ah, terminal area... (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:12:00
ALI ...by a couple of uniformed armed police officers. They then took me into, ah, a room, some place in the terminal ah, and I was asking you know, "What, what's the problem?" and they said, "Just sit here. (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:10
ALI Somebody will be in to talk with you." They gave me no explanation. (crosstalk) 

01:12:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:15
ALI Ah, I told them, "My bags were on the flight I'm supposed to be and they said ah, "Your bags have been taken off the flight." (crosstalk) 

01:12:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:12:20
ALI Ah, which really scared me then. 

01:12:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN But you knew you're not getting back on that plane. (crosstalk) 

01:12:25
ALI Yeah, obviously, I wasn't able to catch my flight and all. (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:30
ALI Ah, they left the ah, room. I sat there for, it seemed like (inaudible ) but before somebody came in. 

01:12:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
ALI  I had these horrible thoughts running through my mind. What thing... (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

01:12:45
ALI ...did I do that would warrant ah, this kind of action. 

01:12:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

01:12:50
ALI  That situation, I'd say it happened six months ago, and... (crosstalk) 

01:12:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:55
ALI ..I really gets put me in, in emotional state that's, ah, that's... (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:00
ALI ...causing me problems at home. It causing my problems at work. 

01:13:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
ALI Uhm, and, I'm, I'm very fearful then. Ah, I don't even answer the telephone... (crosstalk) 

01:13:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:10
ALI ...anymore at home. 

01:13:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Why? 

01:13:10
ALI  Every time the phone or there was a knock on the door and it's not something that I really, really was expecting, honestly, I get ah, (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:15
ALI  the, the hair on the back of my neck raises. (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
ALI I get a cold chill ah, (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  It sounds like it was an awkward experience to go through. 

01:13:25
ALI Yeah, most and ah. 

01:13:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  So, (crosstalk) 

01:13:30
ALI ...you know, I, I'm, I'm sorry if ever, I mean letting it affect me and my family and wife with this. So, you know, I just, I, I don't have any control over it. 

01:13:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Well, I don't think you should apologize about that. That's, that sounds like, ah, a very traumatic experience for anyone to go through. 

01:13:45
ALI Yeah, it was. (crosstalk) 

01:13:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:45
ALI  And the ah, lingering effects this had ah, I mean, it has affected my home, its affected... (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
ALI ...my work, its affected me. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
ALI And I think, emotionally, ah, consequently. It's... (crosstalk) 

01:14:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

01:14:00
ALI ...created a very traumatic stress in us. Especially in Nadia's case. (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. How, how does it ah, relate to Nadia? 

01:14:10
ALI Well, you know, ah, Nadia's ah, mother is a devout practicing Muslim. I, I call myself a Muslim but ah, I don't practice the faith as it should be practiced. And ah, (crosstalk) 

01:14:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:14:25
ALI ah, because Nadia is the only girl and her mother certainly a sort of how resolved an issue but she was concerned about her. (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:14:35
ALI Especially Nadia, she's not doing well in school. (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:14:35
ALI  And then there was talk of, ah, thoughts of suicide came up ah, (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Hmm. 

01:14:45
ALI ...it shaken her mother up. And, ah, I think it really, which caused her to become a little more overbearing than she had been in the past ah, certainly causing problems with Nadia. (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:14:55
 Uhm, her mother... (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, there is a... (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
ALI ...and I argue about that uhm, far too often. (crosstalk) 

01:15:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:15:05
ALI I think that she is ah, becoming just too overbearing, (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:10
ALI ...especially with Nadia's case. Ah, and you know, my situation is not really helping the situation. (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
ALI Ah, the problems that I'm going through. (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
ALI  So, and ah, (crosstalk) 

01:15:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So her mother is responding by being a little bit even more overprotective than you feel like she normally is and... (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
ALI Yeah, I mean, she's certainly, ah, ah, deeply concerned about Nadia. And she's... (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:40
ALI ...ah, she's really adopted their mother hen attitude. Nadia goes to school, comes back from the school, she's, you know, under her mother's watchful eye all the time. She... (crosstalk) 

01:15:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:50
ALI ...doesn't associate with her friends like I think she should like a 15-year-old should. 

01:15:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:15:55
ALI Ah, a couple of the, her girlfriends got together and ah, planned to sleep over on one of the girl's house and her... (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:05
ALI ...Nadia's mother just ah, absolutely had a fit over that. (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Refused? 

01:16:10
ALI And would not let her do anything that ah, (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  She do not tell you. (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
ALI ...you know, you know, in the conversations I've had with her mother, I told her, "You know, were living in America, things are little different here," and she said, (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
ALI "Well, I'm not gonna allow my daugher to be... (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
ALI  pulled into what all the other... (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:25
ALI ...Americans were doing." And yes, it causes problems. (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. So, so, Nadia's mother is very concerned about giving an inch at this point. She's, she's concerned about what, what kind of lifestyle she's going to start leading. 

01:16:40
ALI Yeah, really ah, I think really too much so, I mean, she's even at one point threatened to pull her out of school and... (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
ALI ...get her married off. 

01:16:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  I, I wondered, how, how you felt about that if, if that were a realistic option for you. 

01:17:00
ALI For me, no. Absolutely... (crosstalk) 

01:17:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:00
ALI ...isn't, ah, I think it's extremely important especially these days for Nadia to complete her education and even go out for ah, (crosstalk) 

01:17:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:10
ALI  for post high school education. I have a master's degree in Journalism and ah, (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
ALI ...I wanna see all of my children... (crosstalk)

SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

01:17:20
ALI  go into ah, college and have a degree in whatever field that they think... (crosstalk) 

01:17:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:25
ALI  they would like to ah, (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:30
ALI ...be involved with. Ah, you know, the idea of marrying her off at 15, 16 or 17 is... (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:35
ALI ...just not in my scenario. (crosstalk) 

01:17:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Sure. 

01:17:40
ALI So, (crosstalk) 

01:17:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:40
ALI ...her mother and, I, I know how serious she is about it. But ah, (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:17:45
ALI ...you know, the subject does come up more than once. 

01:17:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. You sounded that you're very devoted to your daughter that you. (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
ALI I, I, I am, ah, and I truly am you know, with the, the two older boys ah, taking up a lot of my time, I really don't have that much time to... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:05
ALI ...as much time that I should devote to Nadia. Between, (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
ALI ...you know, the sports activities after school and, ah, in the evenings and ah, my job ah, sometimes you know, (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:15
ALI  I would go to the office during late at night. I don't get home, (crosstalk) 

01:18:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:20
ALI ...ah, early enough to spend much time for them. We don't... (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:25
ALI ...time to move, ah, (inaudible ) for the next day. 

01:18:28
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. And I imagined this ah, recent trauma for you while being pulled off the plane has, has distracted you even more? 

01:18:35
ALI Yeah, certainly it has. Indeed that real, ah, nervous person then I was a light smoker, I find myself smoking a pack and a half maybe two packs of cigarettes a day. (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:18:50
ALI Ah, and it's, ah, that, that's really not me... (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
ALI ...okay, my ah, nerves were at the point, now we're close to the breaking point already. 

01:19:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN You know, given that Nadia ah, sees you as the more sympathetic parent, now that you have told me that now, it is really not surprising to me that Nadia has come up with something as serious as, you, you know, reflecting some suicide ideas because I, I think Nadia is, is really reflecting all of the stress in the family, and I think she's trying to, to even distract and you, and maybe get the, the tension, and the, and the pressure off of you, and try to deal with this in, in her own way. 

01:19:35
ALI  Yeah, I, I think you're, you're ah, certainly on the right track there. That's... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
ALI  that's something that a 15-year-old girl should be doing. (crosstalk) 

01:19:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
ALI Yeah, certainly she feels the, the pressure. (crosstalk) 

01:19:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:19:50
ALI So, I wanna said, I was shocked of it. (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:19:55
ALI And I've heard that she was having these kinds of thoughts. 

01:20:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
ALI And with the rate of suicide among many teenagers finding (inaudible ) seems in this country(ph). 

01:20:09
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Yes. (crosstalk) 

01:20:10
ALI Yeah, it's, it's a scary proposition. 

01:20:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Well, Ali, I, I, I wanna assure you that I will continue to monitor this ah, situation with Nadia. I have ah, met her once. She's really a wonderful girl. I, I, I think we got off to a good start. And I'm happy to reply, I think she's comfortable with me. So, I, I, I think it's going to work out ah, well, for me to see her for a couple of more times. (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
ALI Uh hmm. (coughing) 

01:20:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And ah, I've told Nadia that I would like to come back together as a family and begin to discuss more of these situations. And so, in between, well, as family situations, I am going to be meeting with ah, Nadia alone. 

01:20:50
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:20:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Just to make sure that I'm not missing anything else that may come up with her. So, now that I have a better understanding of the whole family situation, I'd, I'd like to schedule now ah, a, a family session for next week. 

01:21:05
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And we will begin to take ah, these issues one, one by one. There's, there's obviously, a lot going on here and we're, we're not going to solve everything in, in one family session. But uhm, I, I think we can begin talking about ah, how, how Nadia's feels for, for the next session. And I, I think if we just focus on that, that one topic that, that will be enough... (crosstalk) 

01:21:30
ALI Uh hmm. 

01:21:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  for that session. And then we will ah, schedule others and then uhm, organize our agenda for each one. And ah, I, I, I really think that you can help her get back on track. And uhm, I, you know, I, I hope for you, you will practice here good coping measures. I mean, I, I know you haven't gotten this far in life about having a good management of stress. And ah, I, I would really encourage you to practice these self-care skills. You, you've been really through very, very dramatic situation. 

01:22:10
ALI I, I think talking to you. I really had not been discussed to you what my family situation or my whole emotional situation. You know, if you put it in like that. I think that this is gonna be a good act. It's gonna be remembered. It's seldom opportunity as well as not an opportunity. We're gonna... (crosstalk) 

01:22:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:22:25
ALI ...need a few things out. We'll try to get along together. It's just that, you know, the moment when I can't sit down and discuss because eventually because these are two... (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:22:35
ALI ...might leave me if they, if they had somebody that could give us a more objective topics to comprehend, (crosstalk) 

01:22:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:22:40
ALI such as yourself we'll be ah, help us to cope with the situation. (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:22:45
ALI  I think it would be good for all of us, especially for, (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Yeah. 

01:22:50
ALI Nadia. You'll find that Nadia's a very outgoing ah, (crosstalk) 

01:22:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
ALI person. I don't think she'll have any problems communicating. (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Yeah. 

01:23:00
ALI Ah, she's very sweet girl, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN She really is. (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
ALI  Ah, (crosstalk) 

01:23:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:23:05
ALI we want what's best for her. (crosstalk) 

01:23:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Yeah. I know you do. (crosstalk) 

01:23:05
ALI When the family has to get together for these sessions I, you know, I will make sure, (crosstalk) 

01:23:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:23:10
ALI you know, I'm here for the moment. 

01:23:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Good. I appreciate that. I know, you're very committed to your family. And, and it, that it shows. Now, I'm really looking forward to working with all of you. So. (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
ALI And certainly we'll be on time. 

01:23:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I, I, I, I think you both. You and your wife are quite devoted and, and quite committed. And you're, you're both very intel, intelligent and, and ambitious people. And, and I, I don't think you'll have any problem turning, turning that energy back to the family situation in dealing with these, these ah, stressors that you're going, going through. 

01:23:45
ALI Certainly. I want what's best for my family and I'll do whatever it takes to make sure that (inaudible ) the best. 

01:23:54
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Sure you will. Okay. Well, thank you for coming in and, and we will, we'll meet again next week. 

01:24:00
ALI Thank you. 

01:24:00
Clinical Discussion: Ali 

01:24:00
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  Now that we've watched the vignette of Sandra working with Ali, what kinds of things will be worth, worthwhile to discuss? 

01:24:20
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Well, let's start by taking a look again at what you see as being the primary mental health issues facing Ali? 

01:24:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  One of the issues is the, is a fact that Ali has suffered a, a, a significant trauma. The situation of this mistaken identity that led to him being taken off the plane and, and in fact, not being, not being allowed to return to this flight at all has really shaken him, him up. He said he doesn't even answer the phone. If he is not expecting someone, he doesn't even answer the door. (crosstalk) 

01:25:00
 Hmm. 

01:25:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, and we can't even term this as paranoia because he has a, a, a valid reason for being concerned. So, this is not an, any kind of irrational fear that, that he has. So, uhm, A, Ali is, is in his, his own state of crisis right now. And had we asked him more questions... (crosstalk) 

01:25:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:25:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  for the, the purposes of the training video, I think we would have found that he is also experiencing some deterioration in ah, in other areas of his life. 

01:25:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:25:35
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Possibly, his post-traumatic stress and anxiety. 

01:25:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I, I think he would, he would qualify... (crosstalk) 

01:25:40
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  Depression. 

01:25:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN for that, that level of a, of a diagnostic category, certainly. 

01:25:45
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Uh hmm. 

01:25:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I think it has been a life changing event for him. 

01:25:50
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. And what kind of treatment goals that you set for him? Given his situation with his family and his daughter as well? 

01:26:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  The treatment goals for Ali would be similar to those that, that we would develop for a survivor of, of trauma. So, Ali does fit, does fit that category. Now, he has not been harmed. His, his life has not exactly been threatened but he, he has, he, he has experienced this, this level of trauma. So, we wanna review with him, his, ah, his coping skills. And also include some crisis intervention type techniques and, and approaches with him. And, and in addition, he is also experiencing some marital conflict. Now, he's chalking it up to the stress that he experienced. But, if we take that out of the equation, even his wife are having some serious disagreements as to the best way to parent their daughter. So, we, we need to get ah, him and his spouse ah, to the point where they are able to talk a little bit more productively and, and effectively because we, we understand that a lot of these discussions are just, are dissolving into arguments. (crosstalk) 

01:27:20
 Uh hmm. 

01:27:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And it is their, their ah, conflicts between each other are really raising the level of stress with, across the, the family group. 

01:27:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  And so, what kinds of ah, intervention tool or treatment approaches or therapy techniques do you see as being helpful in this regard? 

01:27:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I, I would say that Ali need some individual ah, time for himself. 

01:27:50
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:27:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  I, I think he needs to uhm, have, have some ah, additional support. When he came in, he made reference to the fact that now that he's talking about it, he, he didn't realize it was bothering him even as, as much as, at as it is. (crosstalk) 

01:28:10
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:28:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  So, Ali needs some help in identifying his feelings and I, identifying uhm, the, the stress in his life. He needs to be able to, to name it, to acknowledge it. (crosstalk) 

01:28:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:28:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And then, to figure out ways that he can, he can cope with it. 

01:28:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON What kinds of ah, background information or ah, knowledge via the culture would be important for a therapist to have in their work with Ali. 

01:28:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Ali is a third to fourth generation ah, person of, of Arab descent. And you get an inkling of that in his views about his daughter. He feels like his wife is too overbearing. He feels like his, his daughter should not be carrying this, ah, this, this level of, of expectation. So, Ali's ideas about culture are, are more of a Western flavor than, than his wife. So, you can see where uhm, it, he, his ideas have, have evolved a little bit more. In, in addition, it's very helpful to understand some of the legislative changes, some of the profiling ah, techniques and approaches that have been put into place, particularly in these sensitive areas such as flying, uhm, we hear a lot of cases now about mistaken identity, and uhm, how, how people have been arrested, have been questioned by ah, by the police, FBI, Homeland Security, you know, whoever. And, so it's important to appreciate these, the civil rights issues that are coming in, into play, in, in this situation. Ali has not been charged and nor has he been ah, accused of, of breaking any laws. And, and according to Ali in, in the information that he gave us that this was a case of, of mistaken identity. So, Ali is going to have a lot of feelings now, about his place in society and his, his level of comfort. 

01:30:45
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN It also seems like ah, some additional issues that are related to the ones that Sandra, that you bring up are again, ah, in relation to the ethnic identity issue because Ali is a third, fourth generation and yet he, he chose to marry someone who is much more recently immigrated, less acculturated. So, so, (crosstalk) 

01:31:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:31:10
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN I clearly hears a tide that he has to his culture of fortune(ph)... (crosstalk) 

01:31:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:31:10
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  regardless of, you know, the fact that he's been, his family has been here for several generations now. Uhm, then I would think that, you know, that that placed into his whole understanding of these experiences, traumatic experiences that he's had in terms of, you know, have been, sort of, uhm, I thought I was American now, or at least somewhat American and yet I'm still... (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:31:35
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...now being profiled by some of this present legislation. (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:31:35
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  Uhm, also, I think where your cultural background and knowledge comes in, now, in terms of... (crosstalk) 

01:31:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:31:40
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  understanding ah, some of the uhm, civil rights issues and resources that might be available to support... (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:31:50
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...or help somebody in the situation of this mistaken identity, uhm, you can validate his, you know, earlier you talked about his, it, it's not paranoia. It's legitimate concern... (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:32:00
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...and I think that if someone who understands that, can really help validate for, that for him in, (crosstalk) 

01:32:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:32:10
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN in, in doing so. Help him to move forward. 

01:32:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Right. Because if, if a, if a therapist is, is going to take the immediate approach of why you were arrested and taken off the plane, you must be guilty. That, that right there would be enough to, to suffer whatever trust or bonding you could, 

01:32:30
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN you could develop with this parent. And now you are at a, at a serious loss as to your ability to intervene effective, ah, effectively with his family because that attitude will be enough to completely alienate this, this family. 

01:32:45
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  And, and going beyond that we didn't really go, we didn't really have the opportunity to go much it wouldn't have been yet uhm, into the reasons for his, you know, arre, or detainment... (crosstalk) 

01:33:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:00
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...and what have you, but uhm, but had you have more than enough opportunity you might have explored. You know, had he made some charitable donations to an organization that was on, you know, federal government watchlist or... (crosstalk) 

01:33:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:10
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...some, something to that nature, and, something to that nature and if, you know, I've heard many cases and I'm sure you have as well... (crosstalk) 

01:33:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:20
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...in your work that of, where somebody may have made a charitable donation in fact, to an organization that to their knowledge... (crosstalk) 

01:33:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:25
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...and awa, awareness, you know, is un, unques, is unquestionably a legitimate charitable organization and yet, (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:35
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN uhm, other entities may define it as some kind of, you know, organization that poses some kind of threat... (crosstalk) 

01:33:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:40
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...or is on the watch list or something. (crosstalk) 

01:33:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:45
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN So, so, even the issue of him understanding, you know, as a third or fourth generation than he still does have these ties, he wants to make that charitable commitment which, of course, (crosstalk) 

01:33:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:33:55
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN is part of the agreement of his religious commitment. (crosstalk) 

01:33:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Yes. 

01:33:55
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Uhm, and yet someone is telling him, oh, you better watch out who you make donations to... (crosstalk) 

01:34:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:34:00
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...or you can't donate to that organization because we say... (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:34:05
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN ...it's not legitimate. (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:34:05
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN Or it's has you know, terrorist ties or something. 

01:34:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:34:10
Part IV: Family Family Discussion & Conclusions 

01:34:10
DR. SYLVIA C. NASSAR-MCMILLAN  Okay. Now that we've looked at each of the individual vignettes, let's take a few moments to look at the family unit as a whole and talk about some of the issues that, that you might ah, bring out in working with the family units now. 

01:34:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Where does family as a whole, ah, what would you see as being the primary mental health issues or problems that they were facing? 

01:34:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  Well, like in, in terms of their mental health issues, what, what I see is a specific issue of, of parenting. And, and now I'm going to par, prioritize that. 

01:35:00
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:35:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, the, the first one that I, that I'm identified is, is parenting. There is a lot of conflict between Nadia and her mother. And one of the reasons that I see for that is again because of, of mothers very, uhm, of, of authoritarian approach. Do something because, because I tell you. This approach may have worked with her, with her sons. It's not working with her daughter. And I think mother is lacking some flexibility here. She, she says that her husband does it. No ideal with her daughter. I think she's, she's having a, a, a similar degree of, of conflict. I, I think she expects a certain level of obedience from her daughter and her daughter is not giving it to her. And so, now mother is at a loss as to how to guide her daughter. She has some concerns about her. She described her as selfish. As a follower, she's concerned about ah, outside influences and where this may lead Nadia. And then, there's also some very prominent intercultural issues with, with this family. And, we are, we have seen them and heard them in terms of bringing Nadia into some ah, ah, re, religious activities that at least participation at ah, normal services at, at the mosque. And uhm, for, for Nadia to ack, acknowledge and, and cooperate with some ah, basic uhm, need to, for example, communicate with the grandparents in, in Arabic. Their English is, is limited. (crosstalk) 

01:36:50
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:36:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  And uhm, so we, we really need this family to identify for themselves that the cultural issues that they are struggling with because I, I feel for them these cultural issues are getting very confused and mixed up in their own mind about uhm, how, how this relates to, to Nadia's behavior. So they're just really looking at Nadia as, kind of a, a problem child right now. Father is, is concerned and ah, but he is also struggling with his own level of ah, of trauma right now. (crosstalk) 

01:37:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:37:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, the, the issues with this family need to be cleared up and, and crystallized so that they, they can get a handle as to what are the cultural issues that we're struggling with and what are the more e, emotional issues. 

01:37:55
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON So, there's a imbalance in the family between the father and the mother and in their level of acculturation and that seems to be impacting their relationship with their daughter? 

01:38:05
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I think it is. I think it's not only impacting their dau, their relationship with their daughter but their relationship with themselves. 

01:38:15
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON With each other? 

01:38:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN With, with each other, excuse me. (crosstalk) 

01:38:15
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:38:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Right. 

01:38:15
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  So, ah, have you seen this is like playing out in the marital conflict as well as in the parent-child conflicts? 

01:38:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I do. I think it's, I think it's driving a wedge between the 2 marital partners... (crosstalk) 

01:38:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:38:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and also this, this teenage daughter. 

01:38:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Okay. 

01:38:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN It, it's also that sounds like they kind of got along with the program. They have found their niche. They have, they excelled in activities that are important to them. (crosstalk) 

01:38:45
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:38:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN But the daughter now is not so easy to parent and, and in terms of... (crosstalk) 

01:38:55
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:38:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN of, what, what is, is important to her. That the parents have an idea of what should be important to her but Nadia is not buying in, into that, that program. And so, we, we need to do some problem solving, some, some brainstorming with them, (crosstalk) 

01:39:10
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:39:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN As to what, what situations can Nadia feel comfortable with. Which peer group can she relate to? 

01:39:20
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON So that then brings us to the next question about treatment goals. (crosstalk) 

01:39:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:39:20
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  And what would you see as being the goals here for this family? 

01:39:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN We, we need to work with the family to find some appropriate social outlets for Nadia. (crosstalk) 

01:39:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Uh hmm. 

01:39:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN We also need to keep focus on her academic performance. (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  Uh hmm. 

01:39:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I, I certainly would not support putting the social needs over her, over her academic needs right now. We need to ensure that she's a successful student. But, we also have to appreciate the fact that sh, that her, her, her social needs are, are not being addressed. (crosstalk) 

01:40:00
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:40:00
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And if we, we don't address them at the same time that we continued to evaluate her emotional like her, her academic program, we're, we're, we're going to lose this role, I, (crosstalk) 

01:40:15
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. Hmm. 

01:40:15
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN I believe as a, as a suc, as a successful ah, high school graduate. 

01:40:20
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. In terms of therapy approaches or techniques or interventions, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:40:25
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:40:25
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON I noticed in the beginning you tried to really work in these initial sessions with joining with the family. (crosstalk) 

01:40:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. 

01:40:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON  How do you perceived the therapy process going in terms of your interventions? 

01:40:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN Uh hmm. Right the, the, the, the process of, of joining with them, it's important that this family put their trust in me. (crosstalk) 

01:40:45
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:40:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN That they, ah, value my, uhm, my opinions, my interventions with them. So, I, I began with, uhm, with, you know, building rapport with each one of them, individually. The, the individual sessions worked out great because, each, each one of these individuals has their own complaints and their all needs, which, which they disclosed in, in the privacy of an, of an individual session. And, ah, so, the, the, ah, approach will be to, to further that process... (crosstalk) 

01:41:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:41:30
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...and help them identify their, their treatment issues. 

01:41:30
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Okay. And that in terms of your understanding and background, ah, knowledge of Arabic culture, how could that be utilized, ah, in working with this family? 

01:41:45
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN The, the value of my background and, uhm, and my, my knowledge of, of the culture is that I, I can put myself in, in the place... (crosstalk) 

01:41:55
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:41:55
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN  of, of almost every individual. You know, as I self-disclose to Nadia I've, I've been in those same situations of having the older brother, you know, monitor your activities and who are you talking to and scaring the, scaring the boys away and I also very much understand, ah, the, the mother's concern and, and the mother's difficulty that she's trying, she's trying to push her daughter in a, in a certain direction that mother has her own sense of pride with her own family and this is, this is reflected in her daughter's behavior. (crosstalk) 

01:42:40
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:42:40
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN She talked about the reputation and being concerned about Nadia's activities so... (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:42:50
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN ...we, we need to appreciate where, where mother is coming from also. She's not just a domineering parent, she has worked hard to maintain her family. She has denied herself even career advancement so that she will have enough time to, to monitor her children. (crosstalk) 

01:43:10
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:43:10
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN So, we have to appreciate and value mother's, ah, commitment and, and loyalty to her family. 

01:43:20
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:43:20
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And then as I mentioned, we also need to appreciate some of the, ah, the, the issues of, of civil rights, of profiling that, that the father has gone through. Father is a, is a prominent, successful journalist. 

01:43:35
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm. 

01:43:35
SANDRA AMEN-BRYAN And he has, he has never been involved in any criminal activity and he is not know(ph) but it did not stop him from coming under someone's spotlight if you will and go in through, a, a humiliating experience of being pulled off a plane and, and walk through the terminal and, and having been detained for a couple of hours. (crosstalk) 

01:44:00
DR. JULIE HAKIM-LARSON Uh hmm.
