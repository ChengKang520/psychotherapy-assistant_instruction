"Commentary on Diagnosis and Assessment" - Glorisa Canino, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, I'm glad to be here in this Lansing. It took us a whole day to be, to get here, and it'll take us a whole day to get back, but I'm really glad. I've met a lot of very good people here, and, uh, I like the place, and certainly the university. So, today what I'm gonna do is to frame, uh, the discussion of the four, uh, presenters you had into, uh, this five particular, uh, topics. 

00:00:45
Summary Important Methodology Considerations Focused on 4 Presentations Development of a conceptual model that responds to aims of study, culture and needs of ethnic minority studied (Leong et al, Gone/ Trimble) Choose topic and constructs that respond to main problems, context, culture of specific ethnic group and are modifiable- i.e. results can translate into interventions.(Martinez Taboa et al, Trinble & Gone) Test validity and reliability of measures used for measurement of constructs in ethnic population (Leong et al, Martinez Taboa et al) Choose a sample that represents the main ethnic group studied (Buchanan/Greene) Maintain yourself within mainstream of research topics and methods while at the same time responding to needs and culture of ethnic minority 

00:00:50
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. The first one, and I will be explaining to you one after the other, the first one has to do with the development, and the need for the development of a conceptual model that responds to the aims of a study, the culture and the needs of the ethnic minority, or the culture, cultural group that you're studying. Then the second important thing is to choose topic and constructs that respond to main problems, to the conceptual model, to the context and the culture of the specific ethnic group. And I add to that they are modifiable, meaning that you can do something about it to develop interventions. Third would be what you have all heard is to test the validity and reliability, but mostly the validity, of the measures used for the measuring of constructs, uh, in that ethnic, uh, population. Then, choose a sample that represents the main ethnic group. And then, uh, finally maintain yourself within mainstream of research topics and methods while at the same time responding to needs and culture of the ethnic minority, if you wanna get funded. Okay, so, let's start with, uh, choose the appropriate conceptual model, and why this is so important. 

00:02:05
Choose the Appropriate Conceptual Model Conceptual model shape variables included in the study, design, and interpretation of results (Burlew,2003) American psychology tends to accept behaviors and mores of mainstream groups as standards of what is normal for all other groups- issue of universality Researcher accepts models developed for other groups that may not respond to culture, context of ethnic minority, new models are not developed Any deviation from "expected results" are interpreted as deviant or methodologically flawed All research with ethnic minorities has to have a comparison group of mainstream sample that is considered standard Consequences of adopting a universal view 

00:02:10
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. First of all, I think all of your psychology students, and for us psychologists or, you know, obviously faculty, uh, having a model is crucial, you know. A conceptual model that, and we all know that sh-, that the model shapes the variables that you're gonna use, and the design, and in the interpretation of results, the hypothesis that you make in any kind of research. However, we know that American psychology tends to accept behaviors and mores of mainstream groups as standards of what is normal. So, most conceptual no-, uh, models that we have read in our psych books are based on what is considered to be universally true, uh, because, and what is considered universally true is based on conceptual models that have been developed mostly for, uh, American, uh, population, mainstream American population. We, as psychologists, accept this research models, developed for other groups, that may not respond to the culture or context of the ethnic group that we're studying. And there's obviously, uh, um, need for new models. Because there are not enough developed that, again, can also be accepted by mainstream psychology, which is not easy. 

00:03:30
Choose the Appropriate Conceptual Model Conceptual model shape variables included in the study, design, and interpretation of results (Burlew,2003) American psychology tends to accept behaviors and mores of mainstream groups as standards of what is normal for all other groups- issue of universality Researcher accepts models developed for other groups that may not respond to culture, context of ethnic minority, new models are not developed Any deviation from "expected results" are interpreted as deviant or methodologically flawed All research with ethnic minorities has to have a comparison group of mainstream sample that is considered standard Consequences of adopting a universal view 

00:03:35
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Now, what happens when we accept these models and we use them is that, and, and if we understand that what is happening is that what is normal is what is, comes from that particular model, and that is what is used as mainstream psychology to talk about what is normal behavior. Then any deviation from the hypothesis that come out of those models are interpreted as deviant or methodologically flawed. So, as result, you know, all research that we do, I don't know if you've noticed, you know, even in this presentation, has to include a comparison group of a mainstream, uh, non-latino white population. Because just the study of African Americans without comparing them with mainstream is usually not accepted, and I'll give you all sorts of examples for that. All of this is based, actually, in a chapter, uh, uh, by Burlew on the book that Trimble and, and Bernal, and Burlew wrote. Uh, I thought that chapter on methods was very good. So, what are some of the consequences of adopting conceptual models which in reality behind them is the idea that, uh, psychopathology and normality is universal? 

00:05:05
DSM 5: A Conceptual Model that Assumes Universality: A Possible Threat to Validity in Diagnosis and Treatment Important goal of DSM 5: provide descriptions of valid diagnostic constructs that can be applied across age, gender, ethnicities, culture & context DSM 5 developed mainly for US clinicians and researchers Is used widely internationally Increasing need for it to consider culture and context in criteria for disorders 

00:05:05
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Let's use the example of DSM, which is based on a conceptual model of psychopathology. It assumes, definitely, uni-, universality of psychopathology even though an important goal of DSM 5 and its quote/ unquote, "is to provide descriptions of valid diagnostic constructs that can be applied across age, gender, ethnicities, culture & context." And even though we know, and, you know, uh, two, uh, presenters here talked about the cultural formulation, and all the cultural formulation has been, uh, out into the DSM 5, you know, again, to achieve this important goal, there's still a lot of problems with the issue of, uh, what is behind, what, uh, DSM 5 in assuming the universa-, universality of psychopathology. Now, I was part of the DSM, uh, work group of child and adolescent disruptive and behavior disorders. And I remember very well, uh, when we were in the process of developing of DSM 5 that there were, uh, two main issues that were very important. One is that, and was said by Darrel Regier, whenever I said, "Why are all the DSM 5 field trials going to be done in English? Why is it that even though we have in our group a Brazilian that wants to have the field trials in Brazil, and you have here, myself, who would like to do field trials in Puerto Rico we're not permitted to?" And the answer that Darrel said was, "Well, DSM 5 was developed mainly for US clinicians and researchers." And that is one of the main, uh, um, um, that's one of the main goals of DSM 5. But you see, so, DSM 5 was never tested in any other language that was not English even though I said I would translate all of the, of the instruments for free into Spanish, and it's used, uh, and ev-, but, you know, even though it's developed for, uh, US clinicians, we know DSM, now DSM 5, before DSM IV, is widely used internationally. Thus that increases the need for, to consider culture and context in its criteria. I'm not saying it's not considering it, but I'm saying that when you test a model, only one group, when you test it only in the, with clinicians of that group, and only within the same language of that group there are limitations to that, even if you do cultural formulations. 

00:08:05
DSM 5 and Cultural Diversity: A Threat to Cultural Validity Few disorders in which criteria was changed to accommodate cultural diversity DSM 5 developed Cultural Formulation for diagnosing as described by Martinez Taboa et al and Buchanan However, the question still remains as to how many will use the CFI and therefore how much we can assure cultural competence Field trials carried out only in the US, all in English Why is this? Emphasis on consistent US research findings for making changes to classificatory criteria Buchanan/Greene state most publications on culture & DS started 90's 

00:08:05
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. We also know that very few disorders in DSM 5, or even in DSM IV, will change the criteria itself to accommodate cultural diversity. So, the question remains, even though we have a cultural, uh, formulation, and I think is a very big step forward, uh, is, my question is how many clinicians are gonna use this cultural formulation? How much can we really, uh, put all our eggs in the basket of, of thinking that this CFI is gonna make a difference, and that most clinicians are gonna use it, and as a consequence we're gonna have culturally competent diagnosis using this instrument, or this, uh, particular, uh, criteria? So, why is it, you know, I kept asking why is it that, uh, we, we cannot put more of cultural competence even though within the groups we had cultural diversity when, in the creation of this particular, uh, nosology(ph)? And one of the things that we ke-, were kept all the time, uh, that kept us from changing anything was that we had all the decisions we had to make for DSM 5 was that if there was to be any change in a disorder had to be empirically, uh, based. And there had to be, you know, uh, not one study, several studies. And, of course, you know, you heard today everybody, you know, almost all of the presente-, uh, of the presenters talking about the lack of, uh, sufficient research among ethnic minorities. The fact that even though we are, uh, being told, you know, uh, by NIH that we have res-, have to have representation of ethnic groups in our studies, you know, there's never enough to be able to say too much about, uh, how the results in reality effect or are pertinent to the, uh, ethnic minority. So, as a result, there's not much that we could do to present empirical evidence that would suggest changes to the culture, uh, to the diagnostic, you know, cultural changes that would go into the diagnostic criteria of a new nosology. So, what are other threats to the validity of diagnosis in DSM 5? 

00:10:45
Threats to Validity of Diagnosis in DSM 5 * Leong et all states that concomitants of schizophrenia vary widely from one culture to another and even among ethnic groups in a single country, with differences mainly involving the content, severity, or relative frequency of such symptoms. * In DSM 5, although the new cultural formulation helps, clinicians are not necessarily culturally competent * Diagnostic validity or appropriate treatment cross culturally using DSM 5 cannot be achieved without achieving what Leong et al and Martinez Taboa call cross cultural competence of clinicians in making diagnosis, not easily achieved without proper exposure to culture or training. Buchanan et al - Cultural competence crucial with demographic shifts and lack of ethnic minority clinicians 

00:10:45
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Leong et stated that, and you've heard this before by (inaudible ), concomitants of schizophrenia vary widely from one culture to another and even among ethnic groups in a single country, with differences mainly involving the content, severity, or relative frequency of such symptoms. And as I said before, we have DSM 5 now, the cultural formulation that helps, but clini-, this alone does not assure us that we will have this, uh, need for cultural competency in the diagnosis of, um, of disorders. Diagnostic validity or appropriate treatment cross-culturally using DSM 5 cannot be achieved, uh, without achieving what Leong and Martinez Tavia, Taboa at al call cross cultural competence of clinicians in making diagnosis. And I don't really think that this is eagley, easily achieved without proper exposure, uh, to culture or training. Uh, Buchanan et al said that cultural competence crucial, particularly with demographic shifts and lack of, uh, ethnographic, of, uh, ethnic minority clinicians. And I would add too, uh, the issue of having, of, even though the CFI, again, I say, has been, uh, a great improvement, you know, I do think that, uh, one way of achieving a little bit more of cultural competence among our, uh, non, uh, ethnic clinicians is to have in the faculty, you know, people who are in itself, you know, of a particular different culture. Because it is through, instead of doing it with a patient, it is with faculty members that we learn more, and are exposed more to the culture by, uh, relating socially and, uh, through goal orientations and working with them. 

00:12:40
Threats to Retention in Treatment (Buchanan/Greene * Lack of cultural competence or experience of clinician may be related to fact that majority of ethnic minorities and poor patients stay only for one session * Buchanan et al state that although outcomes are similar to treatment with non latino whites if patient stays in treatment, main problems is no retention * The questions is whether cultural competence of clinician decreases drop out after first visit * Lack of cultural competence can also be associated not only with clinician not belonging to same cultural background - but not being poor? * Or is the issue of drop out after one session more complex? 

00:12:40
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, what are other threats, uh, to retention in treatment? One of the things that Buchanan and, and Greene, uh, stated, and I thought that was very good, was that they stated that, uh, it is not in itself necessarily the outcomes when the patient can stay in treatment that change over time. Because the outcomes, if you have an experienced clinician, uh, in treatment, even if he's not necessarily culturally competent might end up similar to those of the non-Latino Whites. But the main problem, uh, they said was the retention in treatment, so that the patient is not exposed to the treatment. And I thought that was, uh, um, an important part of what is going on. 

00:13:30
Threats to Retention in Treatment (Buchanan/Greene * Lack of cultural competence or experience of clinician may be related to fact that majority of ethnic minorities and poor patients stay only for one session * Buchanan et al state that although outcomes are similar to treatment with non latino whites if patient stays in treatment, main problems is no retention * The questions is whether cultural competence of clinician decreases drop out after first visit * Lack of cultural competence can also be associated not only with clinician not belonging to same cultural background - but not being poor? * Or is the issue of drop out after one session more complex? 

00:13:30
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. But the question is whether cultural competence of the clinicians alone is what makes patients drop out after the first visit. Lack of comp-, uh, cross cultural competence can also be associated not only with clinicians not belonging to the same cultural background, but what about not belonging to the same, uh, poverty level as the, uh, clinician? We have in Puerto Rico difficulties with clinicians, you know, retaining, you know, patients more than one, uh, more than one visit. And clinicians in Puerto Rico, and their patients, are from the same, you know, cultural background. And we're supposed to be culturally competent, but usually there's a difference in contextual, uh, problems because we are more educated, we are usually less poor, we not, may not use the same, you know, idioms of distress. And that, in itself alone, could be, uh, one problem, uh, in terms of trying to retain that patient. What about other issues, you know, like a therapeutic alliance, like the experience of the clinician, like, uh, 10 million other things that are probably related to drop out in the first session that may not be related to cultural competence. And my, uh, and obviously this is what I consider something that you see, uh, very, very often with most ethnic minorities, with most poor people, uh, all over the world, the retention issue. We definitely need more research in that area. 

00:15:15
Certain psychopathological states may be represented by different diagnosis in different diagnoses in different cultures :Culture Bound Syndromes Culture Bound Syndromes are mentioned only in Appendix of DSM- Not part of clinical evaluation * Together with Guarnaccia and Roberto Lewis we brought to the forefront psychiatry the need to evaluate culture bound syndromes in Latino adult and child populations. * 16% of the adults and 9% of child population suffered at least once in their lifetime an "ataque de nervios" (Guarnaccia et al, 1989; 1993, Guarnaccia et al, 2005) * Strong association between ataques de nervios and anxiety and depression, as well as use of mental health services in both adults and children * Need to inquire about cultural syndromes in first interviews 

00:15:15
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Okay, so, again, let's go back to what I was telling you about the validity, the threats to validity, of the nosological system that we're using, you know, which is, for most of us is DSM. Uh, there are parts, there, there's also the problem not only of the misdiagnoses as been expressed by many of the presenters here, but also the fact that sometimes there are important cultural facts that are missing at all from the nosology. Right now, the culture bound syndromes, as in DSM 4, are in the appendix of DSM 5, you know. 

00:15:55
Certain psychopathological states may be represented by different diagnosis in different diagnoses in different cultures :Culture Bound Syndromes Culture Bound Syndromes are mentioned only in Appendix of DSM- Not part of clinical evaluation * Together with Guarnaccia and Roberto Lewis we brought to the forefront psychiatry the need to evaluate culture bound syndromes in Latino adult and child populations. * 16% of the adults and 9% of child population suffered at least once in their lifetime an "ataque de nervios" (Guarnaccia et al, 1989; 1993, Guarnaccia et al, 2005) * Strong association between ataques de nervios and anxiety and depression, as well as use of mental health services in both adults and children * Need to inquire about cultural syndromes in first interviews 

00:15:55
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. SO, culture bound syndromes are something that are not considered in most standard, uh, diagnostic, uh, procedures. And even though they are not, uh, necessarily disorders, and we know they are not, they are highly related to disorders, and should be considered in a psychiatric diagnosis interview, uh, particularly in the case of ataque scenarios with Latino-Caribbeans. Well, that's another issue that has to do with cultural competence, with training, with the nosology itself. 

00:16:30
Leong et al: Inappropriate use of Assessment Dx Instruments: Another Threat to Diagnostic Validity * Leong et al as well as Martinez Taboa mentioned the need for appropriate use of assessment tools that are translated and tested for validity in specific cultures. * The model of Measurement Equivalence exposed by Berry and by the PR group (Matias et al, Canino et al) is discussed as necessary requirement in the use of diagnostic validity. Adaptation of existing mainstream instruments is necessary if one is to get funded. Adaptation with these models may not be enough if conceptual framework of instrument is flawed. 

00:16:35
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Leong et al say that, uh, talk about inappropriate use of assessment diagnostic instruments, which is another threat to diagnostic validity. And they, together with Martinez Taboa et al, mention the need for appropriate use of assessment tools that are translated and tested for validity in specific cultures. Um, and of course, in both cases the presentations, uh, talk to you about the Berry model, which is one model of equivalence. The, uh, Mati-, Matias, uh, et al, uh, Canino et al, uh, my group, you know, have done other ways of adapting and translating, uh, instruments. However, having done this for a while I can tell you that these are very long and expensive methods that we have to do and use before using an instrument in a particular population. And my question right now with the, uh, funding, uh, opportunities that we have is how many of us can we, can really afford to go through all these process, which takes, believe me, one to two years, to accomplish all of these equivalences with an instrument that is mainstream that we need to use if we want to be funded, you know, but that has not been, you know, uh, uh, translated or adapted to our culture? 

00:18:00
Leong et al: Inappropriate use of Assessment Dx Instruments: Another Threat to Diagnostic Validity * Leong et al as well as Martinez Taboa mentioned the need for appropriate use of assessment tools that are translated and tested for validity in specific cultures. * The model of Measurement Equivalence exposed by Berry and by the PR group (Matias et al, Canino et al) is discussed as necessary requirement in the use of diagnostic validity. Adaptation of existing mainstream instruments is necessary if one is to get funded. Adaptation with these models may not be enough if conceptual framework of instrument is flawed. 

00:18:05
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, adaptation with these models may not be enough, again, which is the other problem, if the conceptual framework of instrument is flawed. So, in our case, you know, many years ago when we first did our first psychiatric epi(ph) study, we went through this procedure. But this procedure did not do something which is very important which was question the conceptual model, the nosology, the psychiatric nosology, in which this instrument was based. I'm talking at this point about the DISC. Let me show you what happened to us. 

00:18:45
Unexpected Results are viewed as Deviant/Flawed: Problem with DSM III Conceptualization First Child Psychiatric Epidemiology Study in PR (Bird et al, 1988) Probabilistic Island Wide Sample 4- 17 years Instrument *CBCL *DISC (DSM III) *C-GAS *Risk, protective factors * 49.5% children met DSM III criteria- Thought translation/adaptation process did not work, more deviance in our population * Professionals, parents did not consider these children in need of treatment * Prevalence lowered to 17% with impairment in functioning (C-GAS less than 61) * Results later (1996)confirmed with MECA study 

00:18:45
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. We did everything we were supposed to do with the translation of the instruments that we used; the CDCL, the DISC, the C-GAS. And then, we ended up in 1988 with 50% of our children meeting criteria, uh, for DSM III. Now, we also saw that that 50% of kids that met the criteria, the professionals and the parents did not consider this need, these kids to be in need for, for treatment. And then we thought, let's see if we applied to the algorithms, to the algorithms are not anything but, you know, the way they, they are constructed so that they reflect the nosology. In this case, was reflecting the noso-, the algorithms were reflecting the DSM III nosology. And so, we said, "What about if we, uh, required that these kids be impaired in functioning?" Not only that they meet the criteria as measured by the instrument, the DSM III criteria, but that they are also impaired. And what we found is when we defined a case as not only meeting that criteria but also functionally impaired, the prevalence dropped to 17%. I have to say to you that for six years we were criticized. Our, uh, we either had our translation and adaptation probl-, eh, process was flawed, or, or our kids really were sick. There must be something going on in our population. So, what happened? Now, we didn't have a comparison group when we first did that study, okay. Six years later Hector Bird and I, he in New York, I in Puerto Rico, and two other sites got funded to do the MECA study, alright. In that study, the main purpose was to test these instruments that were gonna be used for another study, you know, that was supposed to be the national study of children that got defunded, that's another story. 

00:20:50
Needed to Confirm Results in Main Stream American Psychology * MECA study sites also found 49% of disorder in children (Lahey et al, 1998) Problem was with DSM III criteria * Rates were lowered to 17% with impairment functioning * Our epidemiologic results were then viewed as not being due to translation/ or adaptation or to our population being at greater risk of disorder (more deviant) * DSM IV included impairment as important criterion in many disorders but only when replicated in the US 

00:20:50
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Anyhow, what happened was the MECA study, and this is mind-boggling, 49% of children in four sites, Puerto Rico and three US sites, and these are for prevalent studies, you know, probability samples of communities met criteria for DSM III. All of a sudden, our studies were not flawed. Our kids were not that sick. It ended up being that our kids were more or less the same as the kids in three other US communities, okay. But it had to be shown in US for it to be true, okay. The result was that DSM IV then, uh, made it, uh, imperative that for most psychiatric disorders that there was an addition that impairment in functioning had to be there. The symptoms had to cause impairment in functioning, which was not a requirement for most disorders, uh, in DSM. And now, DSM IV diagnoses all around the world the prevalence rates are very similar when you use the DISC, 17, 18%, you know, something very similar. The studies that have been done in Brazil, the studies that have been done with, you know, many other countries reflect not this 49% that you had with DSM III. But listen to this, We had to have a comparison group, it had to be an American group, and when the same things happened it became true. 

00:22:30
Is it Realistic to Fully Use Berry's Model for Adaption of Instruments? * The four step of Berry's model or the expansion of this model by the PR group might be the best ways to proceed for the adaptation or development of instruments to assure cultural diagnostic validity * In the past when funding and NIH environment was more friendly we followed this model before entering the field with any instrument. The first year and a half we did this and got paid for it. * Not any more - what are our alternatives? * Possibly only and Trimble/Gone, structural equation models, factor analyses, SEM etc 

00:22:35
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, let's go back to what I was telling you before about, you know, the use of Berry's model, or whatever model of adaptation of instruments. You know, it could be our models that, you know, uh, Matia's et al, uh, talked to you about. In the past, when funding with NIH, environment was more, more friendly, we followed all these models. Not anymore. We just can't do it. We're not funded to do it, you know. And so, we have to look for other alternatives. You know, the translation and back translation, yes, okay. It takes us three, four, five months. But all these other issues of equivalence unless we use secondary, uh, analysis are difficult. But I want you to know that the secondary analysis that are talked about by Trimble, and Gone, and, uh, the others, you know, that presented today are secondary analysis after you have picked up the data. It's, and in reality you have to adapt these instruments before you pick up the data, okay, because you don't want to end up with rates or with problems in the diagnostic, you know, uh, process. And these are all very good that you find out, you know, structural equation models, factor analysis, SEM, you know, RTI, all of these are state of the art ways of achieving structural equivalence, but you better do them with samples that are not the ones that you're gonna be using in your study is what I'm saying. Because what about if you find that there are problems after all these analysis, you know? You have to fix them. And the problem, many times is that fixing them involves changing the diagnostic criteria, you know. 

00:24:30
Other Possibilities: Changing Diagnostic Criteria by Changing Diagnostic Algorithms * Beals et al(2005) in their comparison of the NCS with American Indian similar study found lower rates of MDD * However, when criteria for two weeks duration of symptoms was changed in the diagnostic algorithms of the CIDI, prevalence rates increased. Specificity and sensitivity of the instrument increased when comparing CIDI against clinical reappraisal. * Adaptation of the measurement instrument sometimes needs to include change in DSM diagnostic criteria 

00:24:30
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. This is exactly what Beals et al did that was presented by (inaudible ) that, you know, changing the algorithms. In this case, and in all cases, it's nothing else but changing the diagnostic criteria of DSM. That's what it is because the algorithms are based on DSM. And, you know, that is what we need to do, uh, many times; changing the cut off points with instruments with raw curves, you know, changing the diagnostic criteria, you know. Those are some of the alternatives that I suggest. Okay, my question, though, is, again, when Beals et al did their study they were comparing it again like we have to compare our studies to the MECA. We were lucky that our results were similar to the MECA results. Your results are different from, you know, the, the NCS results. And my question has always been, you know, who's right? Why do we have to assume that because our prevalence rates are lower vis a vis Kessler's prevalence rates it means that there is something wrong with what we did, or with our algorithms, you know, or with the instrument? It could be that they're truly lower, you know. And, uh, I can tell you that when I did the DIS in the island, you know, we went through all these process, and our depression rates were significantly lower than the ECA, uh, rates of depression. It never occurred to me that it was because there was something wrong with the way we measured it. I truly thought that our depression rates were lower. It, they were half of those of the ECA, you know. And I had reasons to believe from what you heard today that there are many protective factors on the island that, that make us less vulnerable to depression and anxiety. So, true, you heard today that Puerto Ricans have higher rates than any other ethnic group. But you know what? These are US Puerto Ricans. Island Puerto Ricans have lower rates, and we have shown that, you know. And I don't really think it's our instruments, uh, that the instruments that we have used are flawed. I really, truly think we're lower. Okay. 

00:27:00
Other Possibilities: Changing Diagnostic Criteria by Changing Diagnostic Algorithms * Beals et al(2005) in their comparison of the NCS with American Indian similar study found lower rates of MDD * However, when criteria for two weeks duration of symptoms was changed in the diagnostic algorithms of the CIDI, prevalence rates increased. Specificity and sensitivity of the instrument increased when comparing CIDI against clinical reappraisal. * Adaptation of the measurement instrument sometimes needs to include change in DSM diagnostic criteria 

00:27:05
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, again, adaptation of the measurement instrument sometimes needs adaptation of the criteria in which that instrument is based, okay. 

00:27:15
The need for a Comparison Group of Mainstream American Subjects or of Latinos in US * With the exception of asthma research, in PR island researchers can hardly get funded to do research in MH unless we have a comparison group in the US * Main flaw observed by reviewers is lack of 'generalizability' of results * Advantage of a comparison group: Leong et al mention one aspect of achieving psychometric equivalence by comparing means, internal consistency, SDs and by IRT and item characteristic curves. 

00:27:15
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, again, comparison on the one hand is bad because it implies that whatever we find that is different from the mainstream group, the NCS, the whatever American group, is that there's something wrong with us, you know. That we are the ones who are wrong, they are the standard. You know, what is the standard is the American, uh, uh, study. Well, that's the bad part. The bad part also is that if we try, like we have had, have tried in the past to do studies just on our own, without a comparison group, we don't get funded because there are issues of generalizability. Meaning, how reviewers always come back with a question, "How are you results gonna be applied, or generalizable, to the US mainstream population?" However, I have never seen a study that has been done in the middle of Nebraska, you know, that they have been questioned because their results are not generalizable to the rest of the US. You know, but if we do it alone, no. So, that's the bad part. The good part of having a comparison group is that then you can do all these other analysis that help you with coming up with the validity of the criteria in which a disorder is made that require a comparison group, you know. Um, IRT and item characteristic curves usually require the comparison of your data with another sample, okay. And it can teach you many things. So, that's a good part of it. 

00:29:00
A consequence of Assuming Universality of Diagnostic Validity: Few Main Research Include Large Samples of Ethnic Minorities Field trials of DSM 5 Field trials of main stream mental health interventions Requisite of NIH to include minorities but size of sample to permit analyses is not required Genetic repository if NIMH and NIDA is sorely lacking representation of ethnic minorities 

00:29:05
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, I already have told you about this. But the only thing I have not told you about, and I think this is something that nobody here talked about, but I think it's extremely important to, to talk about, and that is we have talked about not enough large samples of, uh, ethnic minorities in the research we do. Not enough publications on how, you know, cultural, uh, uh, validity, uh, is achieved with the instruments or in the, uh, treatment of our patients. And there is an assumption, though, that if we were doing biological research, and I've heard this, when you're doing biological research the biology of human beings is the same. We don't have to worry as much as we have to worry when we're doing self report instruments, which is what we usually do, and what we have been talking about today. Well, I have to tell you that that is wrong. We have to worry as much. But let me by, start by telling you that the same problem that we experience in our clinical trials, in our testing of instruments, in our use, in the publication of our studies we find in the genetic repository of NIMH and NIDA. And what the consequences of that is let me show you. 

00:30:35
# of Samples by Disease Collection & Ethnic Origin (NIMH) (Oquendo, M., Canino, G., Lehner, T., Licinio, J. 2010) (90% screened) SZ Alz ASD BP Depr OCD Anor. Ner. Pop. cntrl. White 5,843 1,761 4,984 6,822 5,527 1,560 1,942 3,853 Black 2,705 61 178 631 163 3 0 1,283 Asian 2,622 0 172 54 4 0 4 Hispanic 1,800 5 332 59 29 28 9 Other 215 7 1585 655 243 122 76 Samples available for distribution, include diagnosed affected and diagnosed unaffected 

00:30:35
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Two da-, two ye-, two and a half years ago, Maria Oquendo and I, together with Lehner, who used to at that point be in charge of NIMH repository, and Licinio who is a genetic, genetic, uh, epide-, genetic, uh, researcher came up with the idea of determining how many White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Other, uh, samples existed by diagnosis in NIMH in their genetic repository. And look at this. It's mind-boggling, okay. You know, for the different disorders, you know, and particularly depression. Depression is something that is so common, you know, among our populations, and you have 5,527 samples of, uh, Whites, and, you know, 29 of Hispanics at that time. And although today this might have increased, you know, I'm sure it has not been at a par with what is happening in the rest of the country. So, I said, "Well, let's look at NIDA and see if we have a similar scenario in their genetic repository." 

00:31:55
Other 1,780 Black 5,898 White 12,121 Asian 2,393 Hispanic 1,249 Total 23.762 Member Samples in NIDA Genetic Repository by Ethnic/ Racial Group 

00:31:55
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Look at this, 12,121 for Whites. And this is, uh, you know, obviously alcohol and drugs. Asians 2,393, Hispanics 1,200. You know, it is, again, the disparity in terms of the research done in something that nowadays most of the money is in genetics and neurobiology, you know. Most of the NIH money and all of the institutes, it's not in measuring self-report, you know, your using self-report measures. It's in using biological markers, or genetic markers. It's happening again, guys. Okay. 

00:32:45
Need for Large Representation of Ethnic Minorities in Sample * Psychometrics of instruments use may not have used large enough sample of cultural group * Buchanan/Green state ""sample may not represent group so norms do not reflect their typical cores. This results in differences in predictive validity for the same scores" * I would add this threatens the overall validity of the instrument * Need to test the psychometrics of the instrument in specific cultural group 

00:32:45
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, we know, and, and, and it has been, you saw how, you know, there's a need for large representation of ethnic mi-, minorities in samples. I don't want to tell you that more. And that this threatens the overall validity of the instrument. Uh, and obviously they need to test the psychometrics of the instrument. I've already told you that. 

00:33:05
Constructs Must Respond to Main Problems, Context, Culture of Specific Ethnic Group and be Modifiable * Some variables and construct are more important in determining risk or protection from psychological problems and mental disorders for ethnic minorities than for the non Latino white population as exposed by Martinez Taboa and Trimble/Gone * Examples are... acculturative stress Historical Trauma discrimination & prejudice, perceived mistrust stigma, language problems, health beliefs role of family networks, familism, family values support system 

00:33:10
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, let's talk a little bit more about the issues related to, again, and this stems from the cul-, from the conceptual model that we use in the researcher in, uh, in the instruments that we use. The constructs that we use in any of the research that we do have to respond to the context, culture, and specific ethnic group, uh, and they also, in my opinion, need to be modifiable. So, in all the presentations, you know, some constructs are more important in determining risk, and that they have to based on culture, context in which a Latino, uh, lives. 

00:33:50
Take Home Messages to Psychology Researchers Studying Ethnic Minorities * Carefully choose conceptual model, constructs to assess based on culture, context in which Latino lives. * Know the limitations and consequences of Conceptual Models that are based on Universality * Constructs associated with migration, historical trauma, acculturation, and environmental context (i.e. discrimination, violence) in which minority lives are crucial, but their risk or protection may vary across different ethnic groups and developmental age * Genetic variants show wide variation across multiple populations, admixture analyses are crucial in Latino populations especially, and admixture vary by Latino sub-group * Possibly in person-environment prevention intervention will be more effective than those focusing on the individual alone 

00:33:50
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. And even though, and remember, it has to be a mainstream (laughing) con-, conceptual construct, but know the limitations. See how you can change it to adapt it to the culture. Uh, and know the consequences of this conceptual models, and how they can limit your, uh, your findings and your interpretations. And always consider that many of them are based on that universality that I question of psychopathology, and, and their (inaudible ). Uh, and I already have told you what the constructs are; migration, historical trauma, acculturation, whatever, and always think that these constructs vary with developmental, uh, stage. They also vary, uh, within and between ethnic groups. And that genetic variance showed wide variation across multiple populations. Admixture analyses are crucial, crucial for Latino populations. And, and possibly in-person environment prevention interventions will be more effective than those focusing on the individual alone. And I'm done. (laughs) 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. So, I have five minutes for questions. Well, if none of you ask me any questions I'm gonna say my, I didn't, I didn't do anything. So, you better come up with one at least. (laughing) Okay, Steve. 

00:35:25
STEVE Thank you very much, Glorisa, for your comments. Um, they're very, they're very useful. But the question that I have is why do we need one norm? 

00:35:35
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. Why do we need what? 

00:35:40
STEVE (crosstalk) Why do we need one norm? Uh, psychology's enamored with this idea that we have to find the right norm. Why can't we have multiple norms? And why can't we see an individual given one set of norms, how we think they're functioning, and compare it to the same individual with another set of norms and see how they're functioning? That way, we can assess what norm is, is the right one. I think one of the problems I think we sometimes, um, shoot ourselves in the foot is that we assume because it's individuals with a particular ethnic racial background they need another test, or that that construct doesn't work. How do we, it may work. If we don't have, use that same construct to see that it works, or that we don't see that same construct to see that it doesn't work. We need that data before we actually change it. Because one of the risks, and, you know, there's a lot of emphasis in the, in the talks today about (inaudible ) clinical judgment and (inaudible ), but it's all about over-pathologizing, all about seeing too much pathology. But what happens when you think something's cultural because they're, uh, for a particular group, from a particular group and it's not? They, they're actually psychotic, but because they're from a particular group, and we think that they're spiritually inclined, we normalize it? So, by having two sets of norms, and looking at data from both points of view, either as researchers or clinicians we're gonna approximate the truth a little bit better than assuming one more, we need to find the right part instead of this idea of triangulate. And so, I think that... 

00:37:15
GLORISA CANINO, PH.D. (crosstalk) I, I agree with you 100%. And ultimately what I think, I agree with you 100%. Ultimately, I'm sure that all of you have heard Insel, you know, talk about why it's so much, Insel is the head of NIMH, why is it so important to do neurobiological and genetic research. Because what he wants to do, and that is what we all want to do, is to be able to tailor the intervention and the treatment one person's needs, you know, so that, you know, we are able, just like we're trying to do with, you know, the treatment of cancer, to go directly to the, to the, uh, to the cancerous cell, you know. And ultimately, if we are able to achieve that kind of understanding of what makes a person ill, not only in terms of psychiatric illness, but physical illness, so that we can tailer the treatment to that one particular person, that one unique person, you know, with his context, his culture, his, his biology, his neurology, his all things, you know, then we've made it. But I tell you, I think we're very far away in our understanding both of genetics, biology, and all these issue that we've been talking today so that we can end up with that kind of individualized treatment, which the ideal, you know. And it's not one norm or two norms, but one norm for one individual across the world. That would be the ideal. Any other?
