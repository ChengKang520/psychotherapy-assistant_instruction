Being Present with Pain 

00:00:15
Ronald D. Siegel 

00:00:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL So for this segment we're going to talk about being present with pain. And I'd like to start with a little story, and this is a story about the boys and girls who not that long ago finished writing the DSM-5. And they had some conflicts among them in fact quite a few squabbles broke out and one of the squabbles I've heard from somebody who was part of the committee was between what we might call the lumpers and the splitters. The splitters were people who thought what was wrong with the DSM-4 is we didn't yet have sufficient diagnostic categories. We were inadvertently lumping apples and oranges together. The splitter said what we really need are even more categories so we could even more accurately target eight, ten, twelve step manual eyes treatments or psychopharmacological interventions for specific disorders. The lumpers would usually hear this and they kind of vent their eyes, the lumpers are often practicing clinicians, and a lumpers would say, you know, to be truthful I rarely saw somebody with a single DSM for diagnosis, in fact many people had some of this, a little of that something of a third thing, and in fact the diagnoses tended to change from week to week even though I didn't write it down that way. The lumper say, so I'm afraid that if you create even more categories you're going to miss the forest for the trees. At this point the splitters typically said, what forest? The lumper said, well, for example you're not going to see the universals in psychopathology. And this was quite confusing to the splitters, they say, what universals in psychopathology? That's like saying, what's the universals between a broken leg and syphilis? These are separate diseases, separate disorders and we need to treat them as such. And lumper say, I don't think that's actually the case when we're dealing with psychological issues. Actually there are many things that psychological difficulties have in common. And probably chief among them is emotional or experiential avoidance. And this slide come from ACT from acceptance of commitment therapy and illustrates quite well what happens when we start to avoid or try to get rid of painful experience. And in this talk we're going to do is examine all of the different ways that trying to avoid painful experience actually contributes to our suffering and how mindfulness practice can help us to be present to that painful experience. Let me give you an example. Have any of you listening to this ever drink alcohol for example. Take a moment to think why do you drink alcohol? Some people say they do it for the taste but I don't actually think that would get many to many of us drink it. If it didn't have psychotropic effects other things actually taste better even though we have one of the most flavorful drug delivery systems imaginable designed to make alcohol more… palatable. We typically drink alcohol because let's say we've had a hard day at work and by the end of the day muscularly we feel something like this, and we think you know a drink right now would just help us to relax a little bit to feel a little bit more comfortable. Well, let's say we're going to go to a party and at the party they're gonna be some people there who we don't know where perhaps worse there are people there who we do know and we think, you know, having a drink right now would make the party go a lot more smoothly. So if we do this from time to time no harm done but if we do this compulsively and feel like we have to do it all the time well then, you know, we have a substance abusive disorder. So we see it for example when it comes to alcohol it's emotional experiential avoidance trying not to feel something painful that's actually at the heart of the disorder. Let's look at some other problems. Take anxiety, if I get anxious before public speaking, anxious before standing in front of the camera as I am right now or anxious about flying in an airplane but I do those things anyway I don't have an anxiety disorder. If however I start to avoid doing those things in order not to feel the anxiety then I'm well on my way to trouble. I once heard a story about an astronaut who is being interviewed by an actor who's going to play him in one of the movies about the early… the early space flight program. And the actor wanted to get inside of the astronauts experience. So the actor said, you know, I don't understand it, I don't understand how you'd have the courage to go up in those early rockets. I would have been terrified. And the astronaut said, I don't think you understand the courage very well and this is an aside I actually had an opportunity to do some work for NASA for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration sounds fancier than it was, I went down to spend Kennedy Space Center to help the AIP people look at mindfulness based treatments but nonetheless I got to be behind the scenes of this Kennedy Space Center and there I saw the early rockets, and the capsules that went on top of those early rockets. And what I didn't know as a kid growing up and watching these things was that the United States was desperate to get a man into space but we didn't have the infrastructure, we didn't have the rockets that would be suitable for that. What we did have were many… many multiple targeted intercontinental ballistic missiles with the nuclear warheads that could hit several sites at once. So what the people at NASA thought was, oh, I know we'll take the capsule off the top of the ICBM and we'll craft the capsule to fit right on top of it. They took the warhead off and crafted the capsule. And indeed that's what those early astronauts went up it. And they were Air Force guys so they knew what was going on. So the astronaut said to the actor, oh, my god you really don't understand this is not about not feeling fear, this is about feeling fear and doing what you need to do anyway. So we see that in, the case of anxiety it's this trying to avoid a painful experience in this case fear that's at the heart of the disorder. Let's take another common problem. Let's take depression. All of us have been depressed at some point or another, and we've all been sad at some point in or another. So take a moment to reflect on how the sadness, how sadness and depression feel differently to you? How do they feel differently phenomenologically in the moment to moment experience. When they asked people this sometimes people say, well, sadness lasts for less time than depression does and that's not necessarily so because it's actually possible to be depressed for an hour or sad for a day but when we are depressed we have the thought that it's going to last forever so that's, that's the difference. But mostly what people say is, you know, when you're depressed, you kind of shut down, you're dead, you're anhedonia, you don't really feel or taste anything in life whereas when you're sad it's quite alive, it's quite poignant in fact if you've ever been to a funeral where people are quite sad together somebody might remember something funny that the deceased did, and everybody can get into it, they start laughing and… and actually feel a moment of joy amidst the sadness. That doesn't happen so much in depression. So one way we could understand depression is it's a kind of shutting down of the emotional apparatus in order not to really feel painful feelings and indeed sometimes people who are depressed or have difficulty accessing their anger, have difficulty really accessing sadness in a fluid way or there may be other things they're blocking of the awareness. And we can even see this in the case of psychosis when folks who are suffering from psychosis to compensate when something goes terribly wrong in their psychological functioning, it's almost always because they've encountered some sort of emotional stress or something which for the rest of us were to happen like changing a job or losing a loved one or a breakup of a relationship, we'd feel emotionally upset. But instead of feeling emotionally upset what happens is they wind up having some kind of peculiar symptom. So we see that across the whole range of psychiatric difficulties that we commonly see in practice this attempt to not feel something painful is that the heart of the disorder. Now, what's interesting is many… many psychiatric interventions are designed to make the pain of some kind of life event be less. A mindfulness oriented approach is different than that, it's about being with the pain. And it's about increasing our capacity to bear it. So what do we mean by this capacity to bear it? Well, imagine if you would a couple of different days in the life of a psychotherapist? On the first day, you've had a bad cold, you haven't been sleeping well, you've been self medicating with a lot of junk food, you've been staying up late watching TV because who wants to get go to bed when you can't breathe, and you did it again and you went to bed you didn't sleep well it was a restless night, and you wake up startled by the alarm feeling really quite lousy, you look out the window and it's 33 degrees and raining, and you drag yourself into the kitchen and let's say you live with another human being, and you have one of those five minute interactions with a loved one that can ruin your entire day, you say something, they say something at all devolves after that. And then you look at your appointment book and you're seeing way too many people and a lot of them are not your favorites, and it's with that as a backdrop if you drag yourself into your car, you start driving to work and on the way it's almost imperceptible at first you hear thump… thump… thump but then it gets louder thump… thump, and then you feel it in your body thump… thump and you realize oh God I've got a flat tyre, I just can't handle it not today. All right now imagine a completely different day in the life of a psychotherapist. You've been sleeping well, you're not sick, you've been working out, you've been eating healthfully, you've been meditating, you go to bed plenty early having read something, uplifting, and meaningful before… before bed. You wake up in the morning actually before your alarm clock because you're so well rested. You look out the window and it's 68 degrees in the sun is shining, you go into the kitchen and you have one of those five minute interactions with a loved one that makes you so glad to be in the world with other human beings to be related, and you look at your appointment book and it is a Goldilocks day for a psychotherapist. You're not seeing so many people that you're going to be tired, not so few that you can have starve and if you look at the names you realize that several of these people, you know, if I weren't working with them professionally I'd like to have them as my close personal friends. And it's with this is a backdrop that we get into our car we start driving to work and we're at a red light enjoying the sights and sounds of nature around us, and bam we get hit from behind. A moment's reflection we realize we're okay, we're not injured, we look behind us the driver is not injured we pull our car over, they pull their car over by a remarkable active or moment of good fortune the other driver is not character disordered, so they say, oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't paying attention, you exchange papers and you have a feeling like it's really going to be all right. This really this is going to be fine thank God, nobody is hurt. So, on the first day, the intensity of the challenge was moderate, it was a flat tire on a rainy day but your capacity to bear the challenge was quite low. So you really felt quite overwhelmed. On the second day the, the intensity of the challenge was much… much higher. It was, you know, it was an automobile accident but your capacity to bear a challenge was higher still so you weren't overwhelmed. So as I was saying most of our psychiatric interventions are designed to decrease the intensity of some kind of painful experience to make it feel better. Oh, you're anxious we'll give you relaxation training or we'll offer you a benzodiazepine or Alizarin, it'll take the edge of the anxiety. You're depressed, will give you Alizarin and hopefully it'll make it so that you don't feel the pain of depression, you don't get stuck in it, etc. Mindfulness practice is on the other hand give us another option. They give us the option to increase the capacity to bear and be with discomfort. And that provides a somewhat different avenue or somewhat different pathway for treatment. So let's start by seeing how this works with physical pain because as it turns out physical pain and emotional pain have a lot in common, and as we'll see emotional pain actually begins or has a central component physical pain that take a moment right now to feel a little bit of sadness. And notice what that feels like in the body. And perhaps point in your own as you're listening to this too where you feel that. Some people feel sadness here, some here… some here, well let's take a moment of fear. Feel some fear, shouldn't take long, think of something that scares you. Where does act discomfort occur? Perhaps here, perhaps here, or here, so we see that emotional pain actually begins as physical pain. So what we're going discuss now about the treatment physical pain is both going to apply to physical pain disorders but as we'll see it's also going to apply equally well to emotional pain disorders. Starting back in 1965, Melzack and Wall put forth the gate control theory of pain. And the idea here was to challenge the cart famous idea. The cart, the same person who said I think therefore I am had a model of pain that said, you know, it's like a rope pulling on a bell. Something happens at your fingertip he didn't know about the nervous system exactly but some rope happens and somehow in consciousness being we the feel pain. And Melzack and Wall were the first people to say, you know, it doesn't seem to work that way. Pain is not directly proportional to the extent of tissue damage, and pain is exacerbated by all sorts of things, chief of which is fear. So the degree to which your human being is going to feel pain is determined both by what's happening at the level of the tissues and the degree to which is fear or resistance of the pain. And in fact we can see this in modern Cold Pressor Test. And cold pressor tests are experimental situation in which they take a as you can see on the slide a tank with ice water and insert the subject's hand into the tank. And if you set up the experiment in the following two ways you get very different results. If you have somebody submerge their hand in the ice water and you tell them they're gonna have to keep their hand there for 10 minutes. And you ask them after 20 seconds to evaluate the level of pain, let's say on a visual analog pain scale which goes from 0 to10, they will say "Oh gosh, it's already an eight and there's no way I'm gonna participate in this experiment for 10 minutes." If on the other hand, you take the very same tank of water, put the hand in it and you say to the person "I'm gonna get ask you to hold it there for 30 seconds and you ask them after 20 seconds to rate their level of pain, they'll say "Oh, it's a two or three, it's kind of cold, but it's not a big deal." So just the thought that pain is going to be unremitting, actually changes the experience of it, same things happening at the level of the tissues the hand in the ice water, but the way it's experienced in consciousness is quite, quite different. So it turns out that mindfulness practices have an important influence or an important effect on this again, on the way in which we experience pain. And there's been many… many studies about this subjecting mindfulness practitioners to experimentally induced pain. And compared to novices, Experienced Meditators find pain to be less unpleasant and here by pain I mean find the uh… the experimentally induced stimulus to be less unpleasant. They can observe the pain sensations less reactively. They find that open monitoring, mindfulness itself really opening the attention to whatever emerges in consciousness reduces the experience of unpleasantness associated with pain and they have less anticipatory pain anxiety. And thus, you could see from that cold pressor test, it umm… experiment anticipating that something's going to hurt absolutely increases the level of intensity. And we actually now have a clue as to what's going on neuro-biologically with mindfulness practices and with the experience of pain. There's a part of the brain called the 'Insula' and you can see where it is on the slide that is associated with interoception with feeling what's happening in the body. It's what helps us to experience visceral or 'gut' feelings and it processes transient body sensations. Now it's not a surprise that this part of the brain is activated during meditation practice because after all in many… many forms of mindfulness practice we're tuning in to what's happening inside the body and feeling interoceptive of experiences whether it's a breath rising and falling or the sensation of contact with the chair or contact with the air etc. In fact, we know from Sara Lazaro's work and her landmark study showing structural changes to the brain that occur in meditators that one of the areas that seems not to deteriorate as people get older if they're meditating is the insula or at least parts of the insula. So another part of the brain which is involved in the experience of pain and… and responding to pain is the prefrontal cortex that's an area appear behind the… uh… behind the forehead and while it's uh… it can be oversimplifying to say this it's involved in thinking about or evaluating pain experience and emotional experience in general. So that if you imagine our ancestors out there on the African savanna looking out at some ambiguous situation, let's say a set of bushes with they shape behind it, this is the part of the brain that would be involved in deciding "Hey, it's probably a lie and nothing to worry about" or "Oh my God! it's a lie and we better take umm… take action here." And here's what we know neurobiologically about these brain structures in meditators when confronted with pain. Meditators who are exposed to experimentally induced pain in the way this works as though… uh… if you're an FMRI machine, they're likely use heat laser under floor or an electric shock or something like that. So the meditators had compared to novices had decreased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex is they involved in evaluating sensation and increased act… activation in the posterior insula registering sensation. So to sum up what was happening is the meditators were feeling the pain more vividly then the non-meditators and yet they were having less difficulty with it they're reacting to it less negatively. And this is not a surprise and it actually connects to a very famous uh… Sutta by the Buddha, in other words, a sermon if you will by the Buddha that addressed what happens with mindfulness practice and pain. It's called 'The Story of the Two Arrows." He said when touched with the feeling of pain, the uninstructed run of the mill person sorrows, grieves and laments, beats will make it nonsexist, his or her breast becomes destroyed. So the person feels two pains, physical and mental. Just as if they were to shoot a person with an arrow and right afterward were to shoot him or her with another one. So the person would feel the pains of two arrows. So these two hours that we're talking about involve first, the moment to moment sensation of pain, a physical discomfort, the second arrow is the reaction to it, the sorrow grieving and lamenting the fighting against the experience. Roughly, what we're talking about is the experience of the insula that feels the interoceptive of experience and then how the prefrontal cortex reacts to it whether it's seen as something averse or something to fight about. So I was talking about this once to a patient of mine who worked at MIT who is struggling with the physical pain disorder. And he said, as people who work at MIT frequently do say "Oh there's a mathematical formula for that. And the formula is pain times resistance equals suffering." And he actually came up with this independently even though others have put forth as well. And let me give you an example of how this works. I remember in the early days of my own meditation practice, this is the uh… 1970s and uh… I was sitting in a retreat at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts and part of the instructions to the retreat… were to umm… hear to the best we could umm… precepts, basically moral rules of behavior and one involve not killing anything. So I was sitting there meditating and I think I was outside at one point and I started hearing.

RONALD D. SIEGEL And you know what, when the sound stops that the trouble starts and sure enough, I was meditating that could see a mosquito landing on the back of my hand and she happens to be the female mosquitoes who do this… relative little that thing in front, maybe it's a proboscis or something into my skin started sucking out blood. I could see the whole back of her body getting big and turning red and then she flew away to digest this and use the protein from my blood to lay eggs. And then I could see the little belt, the little well that umm… appeared on the back of my hand from the anti-coagulant that she had first injected in to make it easier to suck out the blood. And not only was this not aversive difficult, it was actually kind of cool, it was like having your own little National Geographic film playing out, you know, right here. It was an interesting experience in a contrast that with my relationship to mosquitoes in other frames of mind. For example, camping "Quick, quick get into the tent, zip it up… sat in the tent now we zipped it up really fast… sounds to me like it might be in the tent. No, I really hope not… Now it's in the tent, we're gonna die." You know it is so different to take an experience of in this case relatively moderate pain and or minor pain and relate to with aversion, then it is to relate to it with umm… acceptance and interest. Now if we look at the equation pain times resistance equal suffering, what it suggest is if the pain is very great, if we've literally been shot by an arrow, then we would have to be an extremely adept mindfulness student to not have difficulty with it, but very often pain is in a more moderate range. Even a very light range like the mosquito can cause a lot of difficulty, but often times pain is in some kind of intermediate range where it's just disturbing enough to be worried about it, to be concerned about it, to try to resist it and then we tend to suffer a great deal. And what we see that through mindfulness practice is that pain is actually separate from suffering. Impermanence is a gift not just a curse. So often we hate impermanence because it means, you know, we separate from loved ones, the ice cream cone is over, you know, the beautiful sunset is gone, think that we're always losing lovely things in our lives, but it also means that pain isn't permanent and pain comes and goes. And we can start to see that the apparently solid pain states are actually much more like frames in a movie. They're… they're made up of component parts and as we get more adept at mindfulness practice, most of us don't get to the point like the Buddhist monks would write about of actually being able to observe mind moments. Uh… they would define a mind moment as the shortest unit of consciousness if you can consciously be aware of. And they define that as one 1/10000th of the time it takes a bubble to burst. Now most of us don't have that degree of refinement, but we can develop what they say at Google is a higher resolution consciousness, more pixels per square centimeter and as we develop that we can sort of see that pain isn't a solid thing, conceptually it is we say "Oh, that's my back pain, that's my neck pain, that's my stomach pain." But if we examine it closely, we actually see that it's much more like frames of a movies moment after moment after moment of sensations occurring. And as we see that it makes it easier to deal with it. So we see that pain is inevitable and suffering is optional. And the suffering includes the grimacing, wincing and bracing that happens in response to pain, the aversive thoughts, you know, I hate this when it's going to stop, how do I get it to stop. The wishes for relief, the self-punitive thoughts, you know, "Oh gosh, you know, I never should have done whatever it was that I think caused the pain, you know in the case of uh… back pain that I work with a lot." And here in New England where I live, but you know, you go you start doing this in December or January after not having done for many months, your back hurts and you think "Oh, why was I so stupid as to shovel the snow. I should have tried to get somebody else to do it for me." and the anger fear and depression regarding the condition. Now it's interesting, we have many studies of mindfulness practice being used to work with chronic pain and indeed it helps. But why does it help? And might there be ways we could make it help even more. And I think one of the ways that helps has to do with the fact that pain so often exists as part of a 'Pain Cycle'. And one of the ways that we can augment mindfulness practice is by understanding that pain is often part of the pain cycle and designer treatment uh… approaches accordingly. So I'd like to look with you now at one very common pain cycle and this one has to do with chronic back pain. And as you probably aware chronic back pain is pretty much epidemic within the developed world and for actually, this you may not know for actually not existing within the developing world. So this is essentially a 'First World Disorder' in the places where people do backbreaking labor sleep on straw mattresses rather than silly posture predict top of the line umm… uh… mattresses. And instead of having good medical care, they don't have much medical care and their right to work, you know, in the back of pickup trucks without shock absorbers getting bounced on ridded roads, folks in the third world don't have these problems very much, but we have them in the first world. And we have them because we are susceptible to these pain cycles and let's look together if you look at the slide how this works. And let's start in the upper right hand corner with these, the problem starting from injury or soreness connected with an activity. And let's say it was snow shoveling uh… in early winter. So something happens, back muscles start to hurt, we start to get a sensation of back pain. If we are so unfortunate as to live in a culture that already has an epidemic of chronic back pain, we're gonna have some negative thoughts about this. We're going to think "Ah, Oh, I hope I haven't injured myself. I know people with a bad back. They can be terrible. We've all had relatives or friends who've had their lives seriously disrail, derail by this, so often surgery doesn't work. A lot of difficult feelings come up from this." So if we, if you move on the chart to look at the negative emotions, we see that fear, anxiety, irritation, anger, frustration, all sorts of feelings come up. And join me for a moment in doing a little bit of pantomime. Do this in your own body, so you see… what this feels like. When I say three, demonstrate and please join me in this. Demonstrate what fear looks like in the body. Ready, one, two, three… Okay. Excellent. Next we're gonna do anger. When I say three, triad anger, see what it feels like in your own body, one, two, three… beautiful, now we're gonna do frustration. Ready, one, two, three… And finally this is the… the uh… Capstone project for your acting course here. Try some combination of fear, anger and frustration. Let's say you're in the doctor's office, you've had chronic back pain, the doctors tried but none of the remedies have been helpful to you, you wanna maintain a relationship with the doctor. So you're trying to be nice and trying to be good, but you're really angry, frustrated and frightened, how would that look? One, two, three… Right. Something like that. Now what's was happening in your skeletal muscles in each of those conditions? What did you notice in your body? Most people say "That's interesting. They tensed up." Because indeed it many… many of the emotional states that we consider to be aversive, they… they involve as part of the experience of the emotion muscle tension. So we see if we follow along in the diagram, there we have tense muscles. Now tense muscles, of course had, if you've ever had these muscles tighten up on you, they can hurt quite a bit. Have you ever had your calf muscle tighten up and get a charley horse that hurts quite a lot. So what we have is the… sensation of back pain increases where is that gonna do the negative thoughts "Oh my gosh, this is getting worse. It's not getting better. I really have injured myself." If you follow along on the diagram, almost all of us at this point start to restrict activity. We think "Well, I don't want to injure myself further. So I'm not gonna go to the gym anymore. I'm gonna rest. I'm not going to lift objects. I'm going to be very careful and cautious." Over time what happens is we lose strength, endurance and flexibility and we tank emotionally. Now sometimes the cycle will begin with simply a stressor in our life. In other words, we don't have to shovel the snow. All we have to do is have an emotional difficulty arise and that causes the muscles to tense and then we can get caught in the same kind of cycle. Now I've worked a lot with people with chronic back pain and I've had two patients now who have been stuck in these cycles for 40 years… 40 years. Those are my longest term ones and both of them, once they understood the cycle and once they started using mindfulness practice to work with it, actually flipped out of it and they went back to paying, playing tennis, but you can be stuck in it for a month, for a year, for five years, 10 years. It doesn't always have to be 40 years, but these kinds of cycles are very… very common and very problematic. And back pain is only one of many… many Vicious Cycle Disorders, all of which have at their heart trying not to feel the pain because if you, if we look at the back pain cycle, we realize that it is the wish to not feel the pain that makes people start to restrict their activities, that makes things get worse and it is also the fear of the pain that actually tenses up the muscles because it's the fear and diversion toward the pain which causes a greater muscle tension and perpetuates the cycle. So what are some of the other vicious cycle disorders? Well, back neck or other chronic muscle pain, gastrointestinal distress, headaches, temperament ability joint pain, tinnitus which is ringing in the ears, Bruxism which is grinding the teeth, Insomnia, Eczema and other skin disorders, sexual dysfunctions and of course, the whole range of panic and other anxiety disorders. Now I'm not suggesting that each of these different disorders can't be caused by uh… other medical problems. Indeed, gastrointestinal distress could be caused by a stomach virus. It could be caused by uh… food allergy. Umm… you know, insomnia could be caused by taking some kind of uh… medication and on and on and on. But all of these problems can actually because simply by having some kind of sensation or experience, resisting the experience, wanting it to stop and getting caught in a fight against it and the arousal associated with fighting against it actually perpetuates the disorder. So how do we use mindfulness practice is to help us through this. Let's come back to the chronic back pain and then we'll see how might apply to other things. Well, my colleagues and I started uh… actually created a program for this called the 'Back Sense' program and there's a book called uh… 'Back Sense' which outlines as if… if you're interested in doing this kind of work. But whether we're dealing with a backer of things, there're basically four steps to recovery. The first one involves a Medical Evaluation, much as I learned early in my graduate school history that it's considered a bad idea to psychoanalyze a brain tumor. If somebody has got let's say back pain, it could be kidney disease, it could be cancer of the spine, there're all sorts of things other than these… uh… resistance to pain cycles that can cause them and we certainly want to rule those out first. And we certainly want to give people get people permission to move normally in the case of uh… back pain, in the case of diathesis–stress, to eat normally, to do whatever is necessary umm… to resume a normal life and you need a medical evaluation for that. And then after that there're gonna be three steps and we're gonna see how mindfulness practice can help us in all three steps. One of this gonna be cognitive restructuring to basically change our beliefs about the disorder, the second is going to be exposure which is basically gonna be to do what we're afraid to do and the third is gonna be finding ways to work with negative emotions. So what we see here is that this is not about relaxation training, a lot of people when they hear "Oh, mindfulness and pain, that's about learning to relax." Indeed, you can get some mileage out of that, but that's not gonna cure people of these conditions, what's going to cure people from these conditions is to have cognitive change, so that they view their problem differently, to increase symptom tolerance and this is gonna be about being present to pain and seeing how mindfulness practice can help us to do this, to increase the capacity to choose whether to act on urges and this is gonna be about deciding you know, I'm afraid to do this thing, but maybe I can do it anyway, maybe I won't listen to the urge to avoid it, and finally to become more in touch with our emotions and uncover emotions, so that we can work with those emotions in a creative way and help them to transform. So let's start with Cognitive Restructuring. As long as somebody believes, let's say in the case of chronic back pain that my problem really is due to my displaced disc or… something like that. Uh… and does not see the role of tension and fear in the disorder. Well, then they're unlikely to get better because they're likely to simply seek medical interventions for these, for the structural findings and it's beyond the scope of what we have time for today, but there's a great deal of evidence showing that there's a very weak correlation between say findings on M.R.I. and whether or not a person has umm… has chronic back pain. So we have to once the medical evaluation is done and you've got physicians support for this, we want to move into helping people to not be focused so much on what they think is wrong with their body. And mindfulness practice help, so that it increases cognitive flexibility because it helps us to see that police might be part of the problem and it's not advance themselves but it's our reaction to events that so often is the culprit in our distress. And we can use mindfulness practice to observe pain related thoughts to simply notice how often I have an anxious thought about my back and in the case of chronic back pain sufferers, they notice this is happening all day long constantly. And sometimes, they ask people to make tally marks every time they have a frightened thought and they give up after a few minutes because they're making so many tally marks. And you get, also get to notice future oriented catastrophizing, "Oh, no this will never get better or never be all right, or never be a better living, take care of my child." And you notice a budgeting of activity. This is the… thought that "Well, I've already sat for umm… for two hours in this class, I better cancel dinner. There's no way my back could take it to sit through dinner as well." So once we've used mindfulness practice to observe the various coming and goings uh… comings and goings of thought then we can start to use mindfulness practice to help us with exposure treatment. And exposure treatment here is basically learning to resume a normal life. And this is that many people doing uh… the more cutting edge work on back pain, see it as the treatment of Kinesiophobia, Kinesio meaning 'kinetics' from the word having to do with movement and Phobia meaning 'fear' that this is about getting people over their fear of using their body normally and the central reason why these uh… disorders are so epidemic in the first world and so unusual in the developing world… is in the developing world you kind of have to get up and plough the field anyway if you want to eat and people do and because of that they don't get into phobic avoidance patterns like we do here umm… in the developed world. And what you want to do to accomplish this is to help people to resume activity often enough to be convinced that they're not dangerous. What happens is let's say I'm going to the activity, I'm going to resume this, I'm going to start walking again. And let's say I try it but I only do it once a week. Well, what's going to happen is as soon as I take my walk, I'm gonna start thinking "Well, how's my back? Have I made it worse? Have I exacerbated the problem? And that anxious attention as we seen from both the way in which anxiety helps to tense muscles and the gate control model that shows us that anxiety also increases the intensity by which we experience sensations coming from those muscles, if I pay anxious attention to my back after taking the walk, it's going to hurt more, but if I take a walk every day, I'm going to start being less fearful of it and they're gonna be some days when I take a walk and it's you know, felt a little bit better this day. And… that may decouple my association between the activity and the pain and it is decoupling these associations that are so important for helping people to break free. Here's another act image, it's about our psychological experience, when I was a kid we called these 'Chinese handcuffs' and what happens the harder you pull on these things? Well, the harder you pull, the tighter they get. And this is exactly what happens in these kinds of disorders in which the attachment to symptom reduction is where perpetuates the disorder trying to make it so that my back feels better is actually what makes my pack feel worse and what traps… me in the disorder because I avoid normal activity, I obsess over it and that traps me in the uh… in the pain cycle. The alternative is to really get beyond my control addiction, my need to try to control this and to realize that "Okay, I can control my behavior." In other words, I can choose to start going to the gym, I can choose to walk, I can choose to start moving and using my body normally, but I cannot control whether or not I'm going to have sensations of pain. And in fact, when I work with people, if somebody's religious, I will say to them religious in a traditional theistic sense, I will say "You know, whether or not you feel pain that's up to God. That's not up to you. What's there to you is whether you go to the gym or not, whether you rehabilitate yourself, whether you get strong and flexible or not. And if somebody is non-religious, you could say it's up to nature, it's uh… it's up to faith or the like. Now we can also use mindfulness practices to assist people in getting their lives back by helping them to increase symptom tolerance. And the way we do this is by helping the person to use the pain as the object of their weirdness. So let me give you an example, I was working with a… fellow, he was a umm… a lovely gentleman, he was a police officer and uh… his cruiser was hit by a garbage truck and he developed unremitting back pain and he went through MRI after MRI. And he was one of the lucky folks who when we see MRI's found nothing out of place. Statistically, if you take people who're completely pain-free and you give them an MRI in about 2/3rd of the case, they'll find at least one herniated bulging disk, in 1/3rd of the case, they'll find two or more discs out of place. So typically going for an MRI gives people something to worry about because people without pain have these so-called abnormal structures. But he was one of the lucky ones in terms of the imaging where the imaging didn't make him feel worse because after he got imaged, they found nothing out of place. But nonetheless, he had horrible back pain and he had been doing various non-normal police activities he'd worked through their office or he'd done some administrative things, but because of changes in his department, he was either going to have to go back into the cruiser or go out on permanent disability. And he really wanted to be a police, continue to be a police officer. So I asked him "Well, what do you need to do to be able to return to normal police work? He said "The hardest thing, the thing I dread is sitting… sitting in the patrol car. So I suggested "Well, let's practice sitting here." And I taught him some conventional mindfulness uh… practices and he was a person who was pretty emotionally healthy, didn't have a bad trauma history. So we had, we're able to work with the breath and we did that for a while and he's there sitting with the breath. And at a certain point he says "My back, it's really starting to hurt." So I asked him to bring his attention to the moment to moment sensations to the back pain and let the breath be in the background, but let the sensations in the body be in the foreground. And he was able to do that for a little bit and then he started saying "It's… really getting kind of hard to do this." And then I suggested that he bring his attention rather than to the hot spot which was right here to the entirety of his back. And you can see how this might help by just trying a little experiment right now. If… if you can, if you're not uh… at a hot stove or driving a car or something at the moment umm… take your fingernail of a finger and dig it into your thumb a little bit to create some pain and you might want to close your eyes for this, so you can really feel it. Don't go so far as to draw blood or make it agonizing, but just feel some pain. And breathe a little and bring your attention to the sensations of pain in the thumb.

RONALD D. SIEGEL And just feel what that feels like and notice any aversion responses that come up. 

00:44:10
[sil.] 

00:44:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL And now broaden your attention to your entire arm. The arm that contains the thumb from the shoulder all the way down to the fingertips and just feel the whole arm including the part with the fingernail. And breathe with that. And now bring your attention back just to the hot spot, just to the point under the fingernail. And feel that and you can release the pressure now. Many people when they do that notice that "Oh, well that's interesting." It's somehow easier to tolerate the insatiable pain. It's not blocking it out, but it's easier to tolerate it when it's in the context of this larger sensation. And in… fact, when we're hurting and we do this to… the area it provides… a kind of broader sensation in and around it. So I helped him to do that. He was able to do that for a little bit and he was able to sit for a little bit longer. And then at a certain point he said "Oh gosh, I got to get up." And I asked him a little bit of a peculiar question here I said "So, where in your body, do you experience I got to get up?" And he said "Well, the, my back, it's really hurting." And I said "Well, that's where you feel the back pain, right?" He said "Yeah". So what we experience "I got to get up" And then he was able to notice that "Oh, that's interesting." It's kind of a sensation here. It's like an urgency or sort of fear sensation in the chest that makes me feel like I got to get up. And then we kind of urged that we brought the attention to the sensations here to simply be present to the urge to get up. And noticing that "Oh, he could kind of watch that urge come. It would reach a crescendo and then set a little bit. And come in reach a crescendo and set a little bit and he could kind of ride those waves of urgency to get up and came to realize that "Oh, well, that's interesting. This is a little bit more workable than I thought. I don't necessarily have to either move straight into uh… getting rid of back pain nor do I have to go with the urgency to do something about it." So the last component of this is finding a way to work with negative or painful emotions. If you look at the slide, do you remember this fellow? Uh… If you don't, he's a Mr. Spock, not to be confused with Dr. Spock. And if you're a bit younger and don't remember him because you're too young, don't confuse him with Dr. Spock because Dr Spock raised your mother and father while he was actually and the chief science officer on the starship Enterprise. And I believe his mother was Human, his father was Vulcan. And Vulcans' have no effect at all, no emotions. So he was pretty limited in his emotions. In fact, he was what we used to call in the 1980s 'Alexithymia'. 'A' meaning 'no', lex - words, thymia – emotion. No words for emotion. And these are people who have life experiences, but you ask them "Well, how did you feel?" They say "Well, it was not then it's just business or now I didn't feel much, don't have a lot of feelings." And umm… it's interesting that nowadays we don't talk about alexithymia, we talk about Asperger's syndrome which… has some uh… some overlap with them. Uh… Sometimes instead of calling people alexithymia, in the 1980s, we had another diagnostic category which is just to say "Oh, well, he's a guy." But the upshot of this is people who aren't able to feel their feelings very well ten to react to them with a fair amount of tension, with the stress for the ologists tell us is that this mechanism which is they're fight or flight system, which is designed to help us to deal with the target out there gets activated by the target in here. And the target in here could be sadness, it could be anger, it could be fear of something else, it could be anything. And what happens if we're not in touch with our feeling states is when these things happen we tense up against them and this chronic tension also can contribute to these kind of umm… back pain uh… back pain syndromes. So it turns out that other pain disorders are really quite similar to this. There're other muscle tension disorders that have dynamics very similar to uh… to chronic back pain. Uh… And these are uh… tension headaches, temperament ability joint disorder, neck pain of course, knee, foot, wrist, shoulder pain. The main difference with all of these is we have a lot of evidence showing that it's really quite safe for almost everybody with chronic back pain to return to vigorously activity and the uh… again that's beyond umm… you can consult the 'Back Sense' book. I'll give you a reference for that to the data behind that but uh… it's beyond the scope of what we can do in this… in this talk, but basically it's pretty darn safe for most people to move. Whereas with there's other disorders we don't know the degree to which structural matters are playing a role in it, probably not in tension headaches and TMJ. There's some debate about uh… discs in the jaw, umm… knee, foot where shoulder pain, it's… an interesting area. There're… begin, were beginning to get studies. For example, there's a study that showed that I think the study showed that it was uh… 55% of men over 50 or it might be 50% of men over 55, but something… like that had a torn meniscus. And that's interesting because torn meniscus is often seen as the uh… as a focus for surgical intervention, people have knee pain. And we know that Major League Baseball players, many of them have a torn rotator cuff, even the pitchers who are throwing these balls at 100 miles an hour and yet they're pretty functional. So we… simply don't know whether these are the pain disorders, when structure plays a significant role and when it doesn't. Other things like G.I. distress, I've worked with a lot and the same principles apply here. Now the gastrointestinal system is remarkably sensitive to emotional stress, what the stress physiologist tell us is there's no need to digest your own lunch when you're about to become somebody else's lunch, right. So what happens is the system gets over activated and under activated in response to stress. And very often, people see their G.I. problems as dietary and I'm not saying that there aren't such things as food allergies unlike, but what can happen is somebody could have the experience of eating a tomato and after eating the tomato, they could have G.I. distress, they could associate the tomato with G.I. distress –and then in the future every time they eat a tomato, they start worrying "Gosh, I hope, I don't have that G.I. distress again." And all you need is that thought to begin to activate the, our anxiety system, the fight flight system and to get stuck in this. And I've worked with mindfulness oriented, approach for example, of many people G.I distress where once they get clearance from the gastroenterologist that really it would be okay and safe for them to eat a normal healthy diet, you start helping them to reintroduce food and use mindfulness practice to simply be with the discomfort that happens in the G.I. system rather than trying to micromanage it and get rid of it. A less common disorder I spent uh… I've had a number of opportunities to work with this 'Hyperacusis'. This is a very interesting disorder. And this is a disorder in which people experience ordinary levels of sound to be deafening loud and what they do is they start to avoid sound as much as possible. In fact, I've had patients who are wearing umm… uh… industrial strength, ear protection like the kinds of things you see people having uh… in airports in order to try to avoid the sound. And if you could imagine the same, let's say you had fear of bright light and you decide "I'm always gonna wear really dark sunglasses." What do you imagine would happen if you then went out on a sunny afternoon? It would be horrible. Well, that's exactly what happened to hyperacusis people. And here the treatment involves using mindfulness practice to simply start to listen, to start to allow the sensations to happen and when the body tenses up against it to allow oneself to feel the… feel the entire range of experience and not to run away from it, not to be afraid of it. And I've had quite a few miracle cures of hyperacusis where people went back to living full normal lives and were no longer disturbed by this because they had broken fear cycle by doing the steps we're talking about, understanding the condition, exposing themselves to the thing that they're afraid of, using mindfulness practice to work with the sensations that come up and working with the emotions around it. And I'll just mention because you see now this is… a hot topic 'Fibromyalgia'. And I know that fibromyalgia, people who're suffering from fibromyalgia very… what should I say they… they feel hurt and misunderstood by people who suggest that this is uh… a disorder with a large psychological component. But in my experience, it looks like a disorder with a large psychological component and it used to be thought that there're these 14 trigger points that you see in the slide here and it was sensitivity at least 14 trigger points uh… at a certain number of them that were the… the problem here, but unfortunately or fortunately it turns out that it's not just the 14 points, people feel increased pain anywhere, like if you take somebody with fibromyalgia and you squeeze their thumb, they will experience at half the level of pressure the same level of pain that another person would at the full level of pressure. And as Dr. Frederick Wolfe, who first came up with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, he can be in the first committee to… discuss this. He said "I'm afraid we're creating an illness rather than curing one". Because what's happened is we've gotten so many people now who are afraid that they have fibromyalgia and the fear of the pain locks people into… into these kinds of cycles. You know, can never know the future, maybe we'll discover something that hasn't yet been discovered that's the uh… if… you will be, you know, a virus uh… neuron-logical disorder rather than anxiety that's … that's afford here, but uh… it has seemed to me that the same principle that we've seen in these other pain cycles can be the one here and that if we can teach people to be present to their pain and use mindfulness practice to do that they're much likelier to much less likely to get coordinate. So finally, let's spend a couple of minutes looking at how this works with other kinds of pain. Now there's a umm… there's a wonderful, I mean it's wonderful in the sense of it's an illustrative though painful Zen teaching story about this. It said that there was a umm… marauding general who had come to a town in the olden days in Japan and he and his troops were doing horrible things. They were raping women. They were burning the crops. They were committing other acts of vandalism. They were killing the able bodied boys and men. And uh… this general was really intent on vanquishing the uh… the town and he caught when that they really respected theirs and master. So what he did was he rode his horse up the mountain side and actually rode his horse right into the main hall of Zen temple and they're sitting on his up when his meditation cushion was this little old man the Zen master. And he raised up his bloody sword and said "Don't you realize, I could run you through with this sword without blinking an eye?" And the Zen Master looked up and he said "Yes and I, Sir, can be run through with the sword without blinking an eye." And it said that at that moment the general got flustered and left town. Now I'm not suggesting this will always work as a military intervention. But it speaks to this capacity to be with and feel pain. And it really applies quite a bit to an emotional pain. And let me illustrate how this works. Let's say I'm not a student of mindfulness and a friend of mine who I think I've been super generous to does me dirty. He's… unfair to me in some way. And I'm going to think "I can't believe you did that to me after all I've done for you and I'm going to go through that narrative. I'd have been every time I have that narrative, I'm going to feel the muscle tension of anger and every time I feel the muscle tension of anger, it's going to generate more of a narrative and this will keep going for some length of time. Now if I'm a mindfulness student and I've been with this for a while, might go something like this "The thought that'll arise and I'll notice the thought is the thought." The muscles will tighten up and I notice the muscles tighten up. The image, the visual image of decapitating the former friend might dance to the mind's eye. All of these things will occur, but there won't be a sense of identifying with them in quite the same way, there won't be a sense of believing in this in some way rather we'll observe, I'll observe the emotion as a cognitive scientist would describe an emotion which is a bodily sensation usually a painful one, accompanied by a thought and sometimes an image. And this can occur for all of the dominant emotions and we can notice where we feel them in the body. Anger that we feel perhaps appear. Fear that maybe we feel here. Lust we don't have to point to where that is. Joy which we feel is an uplifting feeling in the… chest. All of these different emotions arise and we can tend to see them as more impersonal events arising and passing, arising and passing. And this practice is then help us to embrace the emotions including their pain rather than pushing them away. You know, it said that in the umm… in the Buddhist tradition that if you took a teaspoon full of salt and you poured it into a glass of water and you went to drink that water, it would be too intense to be unpalatably salty. But if I took that same teaspoon full of salt and I poured it into a vast clear pond I could drink of that pond with no difficulty. And you notice, if you've taken up this practice is that over time the mind becomes a little bit more like a pond. It becomes more spacious and we're able to allow these different feelings to rise and pass. So just to umm… to give you an example of the practical application of this umm… with an emotional problem. Let's look at anxiety for a few minutes and uh… give you a flavor of this. Anxiety hurts, it makes sense that anxiety hurts because if it didn't, we wouldn't avoid things that make us anxious. Let's say I'm hanging out on the African savanna and I'm really at home with anxiety, I like the feeling. Well, then I walk right up to the line or walk right up to the snake, not so good for survival, right. Rather we recoil from things that generate anxiety because the sensation of anxiety is painful. And the problem is that humans we tend to overdo this. We do various things to avoid it. It could be the 'Diver Dan' approach to life. This is, well, I just won't do anything that might make me nervous. If I'm going to be Airport, I'll show up three hours early, but you know better still I won't travel. And we get involved in all sorts of phobic avoidance and constriction, trying to avoid activities that might bring up the feeling of anxiety. We spend a lot of effort Medicating discomfort whether legally or illegally. We distract ourselves Google says we check our Smartphone about a 145 times a day. I don't think that's always, because there's a crucial message. I think we're checking our Smartphone often times because a little bit of anxiety comes up, little bit of restlessness, little discomfort and moving toward this distraction helps us. And we also develop stimulation tolerance. We need more and more and more. Remember the old days of Perry Mason, and if you're younger and don't recall Perry Mason, it was the original kind of cop and lawyer show and there'd be a scene in Perry Mason, where you see a hand and it would have a gun, it would go pop. And then you'd see somebody lying down. I don't think there was ever any blood. And this is all happening on a 14 inch black and white set, a new survey of… the country. Nowadays of course, you know, if you're watching, I don't know Law and Order, hideous events eight or whatever… whatever they're up to, there's always at least two stories because with one story your thoughts and feelings and worries might enter into consciousness. And in the first story, there's a DOA child being ritually dismembered by satanic cult. In the second one, there's a DOA, there's uh… a very sexy vixen, doing something very sexual. And this is all happening on a 50 to 60 inch full color high definition flat screen T.V. and we're perfectly capable of looking and saying "Well, there's nothing to stimulating on here. Let me change the channel." So what happens is in order to… try to distract ourselves from our fears and from our anxieties, we get into more and more Vivid Entertainment. And indeed, the culture is supporting more and more vivid entertainment. The problem is that tries we might to distract ourselves, to medicate ourselves, to avoid situations, sooner or later we run into things that make us anxious. And let's look at a classic situation and how it evolves into an anxiety disorder. Let's say we're in the supermarket and let's say we, we're walking down the aisle and now the strict biological determinism behaviors would say "Well, this happens umm… just at random. But those of us who are a little bit more psychic dynamic of thinking think, now there's something happens that creates an association that brings up the anxiety. So let's say when I was five years old, something happened at the breakfast table with my older brother involving Cocoa Puffs, long since forgotten because it was painful. I'm walking down the cereal aisle in my peripheral vision, I spy the cocoa puffs and that's enough to get a little anxiety going. And if I have negative attributions to this and I think "Oh-oh, I'm going to have an anxiety attack. Oh-oh, I'm going to have a cardiac event. Oh-oh, I feel sick. I'm going to want to get it to stop." or I make this one to get stop because it's uncomfortable to feel the anxiety. What will I do? I probably like go outside for a breath of fresh air, right. And as I get outside, I leave the situation, the anxiety abates and this reduction and anxiety is negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is the kind of uh… umm… good feeling we get from removing and not just stimulus. So how do we treat this? Well, you know the classic treatment is 'Exposure and Response Prevention', basically, facing our fears. You know, it said that by the mid 1980s, there wasn't a single college upper class man or woman with an untreated snake phobia and this is because they had all been recruited for studies in psychology department and the studies all looked the same. You start with the snake locked in an office down the hall and you tell the student about it. Student gets upset "Oh, my God, what kind of snake." And gradually move the snake closer and what you really need to resolve the issue is to have the snake in the office with the… with the subject and to lift the cover off of these caves and have the student where the subject actually handle the snake. And if as a researcher, you've had sufficient foresight as to choose a non-venomous species doing this on a number of occasions will indeed resolve the snake phobia. Now of course, this isn't exactly what most of our patients want. Our patients or our clients want us to remove the anxious feeling. And instead, what we're gonna do is increase their capacity to bear it, help them to be present to the pain, the same thing we've been talking about before. And in so doing this will change their relationship to the pain. Now that can be a little hard, a little bit of a hard sell in treatment because most people, they kind of want pain so they has pains, if they don't literally want the drugs, they want some psycho social intervention that's going to help them to feel calm, feel like I can control the anxiety. But what we're gonna do here instead in helping people to increase the capacity for patients with pain is instead help them to actually feel anxious and stay with it. And this is nothing new here is what the Buddha said about this one "Why do I always expecting fear and dread? What if I subdue that fear and dread keeping the same posture that I'm in when it comes upon me? While I walked, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither stood nor sat nor lay down until I had subdued that fear and dread." So what he's saying is "I'm not going to try to avoid it. I'm going to simply stay with the experience." Now there's an interesting practice you can try for this and I'll give you a resource where you can download it, you can download it from mindfulness-solution.com. And I think of it as a stepping into fear practice. There's umm… uh… a favorite uh… Watson Cartoon uh… of mine that shows a umm… a guy with the kind of fishing rod suspending a like a phone booth and from it out of a window high… high above the street and there's a guy locked in the phone booth and it says "Professor Gallagher and it's controversial technique of simultaneously confronting the fear of heights, snakes and the dark." And really what we're doing is what Gallagher was doing was exposure treatment. And this is a form of exposure treatment. It's a little bit different. And now we don't have time to do the full exercise here, but I'll just explain how it works. Basically, you have a person do some mindfulness practice with the breath or listening or some other object of awareness then you have them generate some fear, feel the fear, breathe with the fear and not try to get rid of the fear. So you ask them to hold on to the fear and sustain the sensation of fear and simply stay with the moment to moment sensations of fear in the body. And if you try to do that for about 20 or 30 minutes, what you find is nobody can keep it up. Even people who are highly, highly anxious have difficulty maintaining the anxiety. And instead, what happens is they have to come up with more and more dire images or thoughts to try to maintain the anxiety. And this is called 'Stepping into fear' and you can find it in mindfulness-solution.com and give it a try for yourself. Umm… I've had the experience of uh… doing a course different from this it's a ten week course in… in Mindfulness and… Psychotherapy in which several thousand people have taken the course now and each of them has tried this with a number of people. So I have a kind of large and… if the therapist can manage not to be too frightened him or herself that the patient's gonna run out of the room and go right to license and board and said "They made my anxiety worse." If you're not afraid of being with the pain of anxiety then they become not afraid of it and it actually becomes very, very helpful. Now as a practical matter umm… just uh… to sum up in working with anxiety umm… you probably, if somebody is very… very anxious it's easier to start with things like walking meditation or eating meditation or things that are a little bit more anxiolytic because we in… all this work and in this… idea of embracing or being with pain, you don't want to start with that which is overwhelming, which is too hard. You want to modulate it and work with something which is in the middle range which is challenging but not overwhelmingly, so umm… for the person that you're working with. And it's much easier for a highly anxious person to pay attention to the sensations of the feet on the ground as they walk then is to just sit with the breath. And a last piece to mention here is that umm… a lot of anxiety is signal anxiety. It actually fears of the Tigers within. It's fear of our own anger or sadness perhaps our sexual urges, repressed or suppressed memories, unacceptable thoughts. And mindfulness practice by a tuning as to what's happening interoceptively helps us to see the full range of emotions, the full range of impulses, so that we're not so afraid of it. So it's… it's interesting the way we're addressing the pain, avoidance cycle in two ways. One is by feeling the anxiety, but the other is by using the practices to actually feel whatever the underlying emotions might be because at least what I find. When I'm anxious almost always, if I pay attention to it, I notice some other emotions mixed in there. For me it happens to be sadness very often. I'll get anxious rather than just being sad right away. And if I can connect to the underlying sadness, it helps it to be more fluid and more transformative. So that's… it for a little talk umm… a couple of resources backsense.org. You can get more information. It's a primitive website from years ago, when we put together uh… the book called 'Back Sense' which uh… you welcome to investigate also, which really walks people through using mindfulness along with an aggressive rehabilitation program to resolve issues of chronic back pain. And then more broadly through recorded meditations, you can go to what I mentioned mindfulness-solution.com and that's where you'll find the stepping into fear exercise and other related ones are sittingtogether.com which many of the umm… which uh… which we put together umm… other people who are presenting in the series uh… were part of that as well. Umm… and uh… there's my email and I thank you very much for your attention.
