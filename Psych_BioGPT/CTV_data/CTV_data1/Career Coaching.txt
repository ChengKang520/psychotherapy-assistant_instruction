00:00:40
KAY RICHARDSON So I’ll give you the definition and the philosophy that’s behind it. So coaching is partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their potential both professionally and personally. So it’s you know, you can hear in that that it’s collaborative, it’s creative and it’s inspiring. So umm… it’s also tremendously respectful. The philosophy behind it is one that honors the client as the expert on his or her own life and work. And coaching also views each client as creative resourceful and whole. 

00:01:20
What is the origin of that definition? 

00:01:25
KAY RICHARDSON Yes. Ah… It comes from an organization called the International Coach Federation and that's just the largest global organization for organizing coaches, certifying them, also accrediting coach training programs. 

00:01:40
How does this collaborative process work? 

00:01:45
KAY RICHARDSON So in this process there is really four parts, four main parts to it. Umm… and so it first begins with discovering, clarifying and aligning with what the clients wants to achieve. And then secondly you encourage client self-discovery so that could include you know usually you’re starting with whatever it is there really wanting to know more about and then helping them discover who they really are, what’s really most important to them so that they can align their life with that. Umm… So then the third part is eliciting client-generated solutions and strategies and so this is a really key component because you are always looking for a way in to discover the clients best answers for themselves, you know rather than me telling the client what they should do, it’s me working to find their way to get to a deeper part of themselves that really holds those best answers. So that’s what that third piece is about. And then the fourth part is holding the client responsible and accountable, meaning helping them to make commitments to themselves so that they actually follow through and helping them structure that in a way that’s really doable for them so that they get to set themselves up for success. 

00:03:05
How do you carry out this process? 

00:03:10
KAY RICHARDSON So there is not one right way ah… you know because it’s collaborative. You really wanna work with each unique client to help discover okay, how am I getting go about helping this particular person find their best answers, create a plan that’s gonna work for them and follow through. Umm… So I am gonna demonstrate a number of tools that I have found particularly useful in the session that’s coming up and in that I’ll break it down and I'll outline each tool before we get to that part so that you will be able to see you know how I go about doing it, but I just also wanna throw in that you know I don’t believe there’s one best way one right way, I believe you know I really hold a lot of respect for the tremendous variety of approaches that are out there for working with clients because there are so many unique people on the planet. There is a need for (inaudible ) approaches. These are just some tools that I have found particularly useful. 

00:04:05
Career Coaching is… • partnering with clients • thought-provoking/creative process • inspires to maximize professional potential Respectful philosophy… • honors the client as expert • believes every client is creative/resourceful/whole Career coaching assumes… • client is ready for change • taking responsibility for their life • interested in maximizing potential • counseling = wider range of clients • coaching tools integrate into counseling • when respectful philosophy fits • International Coach Federation (ICF) coachfederation.org • Coach for Life, ICF Accredited Coach Training Program coachforlife.com 

00:04:10
KAY RICHARDSON Building on the definition for life coaching, career coaching is partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that specifically inspires them to maximize their professional potential. Coaching is based on a respectful philosophy that honors the client as the expert in his or her life and work and also believes every client is creative, resourceful and whole. Career coaching assumes that the client is ready for change, is taking responsibility for their life and is interested in maximizing their professional potential. And counseling addresses a wider range of clients and challenges but coaching tools can be integrated into counseling, especially when the respectful philosophy is a fit for example, in postmodern approaches such as collaborative language systems, solution focused or narrative therapy. These definitions and some of the tools that would be demonstrated were adapted from these sources, the International Coach Federation and Coach for Life, an ICF Accredited Coach Training Program. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:40
KAY RICHARDSON Now I'll demonstrate career coaching with Joe. In this you will see the collaborative process of coaching in which I discover, clarify, and align with what the client wants to achieve. I encourage client self-discovery, I elicit client-generated solutions and strategies and hold the client responsible and accountable to himself. 

00:06:05
Collaborative process: 1. Discover, clarify, and align with what client wants to achieve 2. Encourage client self-discovery 3. Elicit client-generated solutions and strategies 4. Hold client responsible and accountable 

00:06:10
KAY RICHARDSON The first section covers three parts after discovering what Joe would like to achieve, his intention guides the focus throughout the session. Then I’m exploring what are the different career paths he’s considering? And then discovering what’s the essence of career fulfillment for Joe? 

00:06:30
•Client’s intention guides focus •Career paths considering? •Essence of fulfillment? 

00:06:35
KAY RICHARDSON So Joe I am just curious to know what would you love to walk away from this session with at the end of our conversation? 

00:06:40
JOE I am… (inaudible ) question I am thinking to have more clarity. 

00:06:45
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:06:50
JOE Umm… and where I want to go as I find myself in this career path that I am in… 

00:06:55
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:06:55
JOE … of becoming a marriage and family therapist, so just… 

00:06:55
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:07:00
JOE …being able to have more clarity and more sense of the direction that I wanna do work in. 

00:07:00
KAY RICHARDSON Nice, Okay. 

00:07:05
JOE …with that… with that part so… 

00:07:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, great. So that’s… that’s totally then what can focus on. So umm… So what are the different parts that you are considering? I’m just kind of curious to know if you are with… Did you say you are getting close to the end of your program to graduating? 

00:07:20
JOE Yeah, coming… coming in, I got about six months left… 

00:07:25
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:07:25
JOE …and so with that there is some anxiety you know, and what am I gonna do, what do I… what do I… what work do I wanna do to be with in regards to working with community. 

00:07:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm… Hmm… 

00:07:40
JOE So I am kind of seeing myself do I wanna be with adolescents… 

00:07:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:45
JOE …do I wanna be with more family systems… 

00:07:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:50
JOE Even umm… working with Latinos… 

00:07:50
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:07:50
JOE …and family. So I am just kind of feeling like it’s just all over the place, so kind of… 

00:07:55
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:07:55
JOE …finding out where I have a… where my passion is. 

00:08:00
KAY RICHARDSON Yes. 

00:08:00
JOE You know and I know a passion of mine is to help people so… 

00:08:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. So you know when you got the broad passion to help people and so now you wanna to narrow down, stick on and direct your career a little more specifically? 

00:08:10
JOE Right. 

00:08:15
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. When you started grad school, did you have a particular passion for a specific population? 

00:08:20
JOE Umm… looking back, I would have to say I would have been well is there still some part, it’s with adolescents. 

00:08:25
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:08:30
JOE Umm… and adolescents that are within foster care umm… umm… and just working with them in general, just I know there’s a a drive for working with foster care youth. 

00:08:40
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:08:45
JOE And I’ve had background working in a residential facility. 

00:08:45
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:08:50
JOE And so umm… just being there and as a… as a worker at that time and just listening I kind of felt like there needs to be more than that… 

00:08:55
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:08:55
JOE …with those ah… with that youth friends, so there was a part of me that’s saying in order for me do this I need to take this career and going to get my master’s work and so that’s… 

00:09:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:05
JOE …where I ended up going and there is still that part of me that’s saying like go back and… and work. 

00:09:10
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:15
JOE So, ah… 

00:09:15
KAY RICHARDSON I can see your face lights up as you start to talk about then doesn't… Did it touch you? 

00:09:15
JOE Yeah, because you know, I mean I did for me. Yeah it hits me here. Umm… because there is a lot a lot of pain, umm… as I listened to stories, you know, when I was in that space but then also there is that connection to myself and what it was like for myself growing up… 

00:09:35
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:09:40
JOE …and not having really anyone to… to listen to me and… 

00:09:40
KAY RICHARDSON Okay 

00:09:45
JOE Umm… feeling like no one understands me and… 

00:09:45
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:09:45
JOE …so just knowing that I can… I can feel their pain… 

00:09:50
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:50
JOE …and wanting to understand them and… and help them how they wanna be helped. So yeah. 

00:09:55
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… Wow! I think that’s a beautiful intention. 

00:10:00
JOE Yeah. 

00:10:00
KAY RICHARDSON Really is and to bring that… that personal life experience to it, it’s like you could understand them in a much deeper level than… than others. 

00:10:10
JOE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:15
KAY RICHARDSON So umm…tell me what else you loved about that job? And just what you got out of working with those adolescents? 

00:10:20
JOE I wanna say allowing… allowing them to just be kids… 

00:10:25
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:10:25
JOE …allowing them to… to feel free of… of… of having fun. 

00:10:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:35
JOE I think it was in… I… the one thing that I really loved doing was creating activity farm and they were really fun activities and umm… allowing themselves to be kids while they are doing these activities… 

00:10:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:45
JOE …because I felt like a lot of times a lot of these kids were on their own and have to be adults right away, 

00:10:55
KAY RICHARDSON How to grow up too fast. 

00:10:55
JOE Yeah, too fast and so umm… not being able to have fun and… and be… and be kids… 

00:11:00
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:00
JOE …you know and… and being… and providing a safe… a safety net for them too. 

00:11:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:05
JOE But I think a lot of it was being able to interact and have fun with these kids and seeing their… their innocence… 

00:11:10
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:11:15
JOE …you know as being kids and having fun… 

00:11:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:15
JOE …but then there was also that part for me was being there with them as they were sharing their stories. 

00:11:25
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:11:25
JOE You know so really being with them when they were really having their hard times. 

00:11:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:11:30
JOE And just sitting there and listening and… and being with them… 

00:11:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:35
JOE I found that that was really moving and exciting… 

00:11:35
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:11:35
JOE …you know because I also felt at those moments for some, I felt it was a way of growth but also healing… 

00:11:45
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:11:45
JOE …for them. 

00:11:45
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:11:50
JOE And umm… just to have another human being sit… you know, sitting next to someone and just listening, I think that’s a lot of work and that’s happening already. 

00:12:00
KAY RICHARDSON Absolutely. 

00:12:00
JOE So… 

00:12:00
KAY RICHARDSON I think it’s huge to sit and listen to someone and really care about them and especially for adolescents like this that haven’t had that. 

00:12:10
JOE Hmm…Hmm… yeah, and… and I think right now as something that’s coming up for me as talking… as we’re talking about this is… 

00:12:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:15
JOE …just a fact of being a male and a lot of these kids I… I remember the lack of not having a father figure or not having a positive male in their lives. 

00:12:25
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
JOE And so being able to… to be there with them and… and be with their feelings and their stories and… 

00:12:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:35
JOE …knowing that I’m here it’s umm… consistent… 

00:12:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:40
JOE …really allow them to see you know males differently or… 

00:12:45
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:45
JOE Ah… so in that sense. 

00:12:50
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:50
JOE Yeah 

00:12:50
KAY RICHARDSON That’s so needed. 

00:12:50
JOE Yeah 

00:12:50
KAY RICHARDSON That’s so needed. Umm… What… we know what all you got out of that. I can hear these great things that they got out of that, your time with them and just how powerful that was. You need just all these aspects you are talking about. I am curious to know, okay what was the essence of what you got out of that job? You know just what… what were the important things for you? 

00:13:15
JOE I think for me, as I look back, I think what was important for me as when I was in that space was to kind of open the door for… or not even open the door but just having this… this vision of helping people in… in another way. 

00:13:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:35
JOE And so as… as I say that, umm… I was… that’s where I was like well, I wanna become a marriage and family therapist. I wanna be a clinician. 

00:13:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:45
JOE And so I think as I was able to… it was like, I think these practical skills were… were being… were coming forth as I was working so… 

00:13:55
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:55
JOE …whether I was being an… an active listener, being apathetic… 

00:14:00
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:00
JOE ah… non-judgmental… 

00:14:00
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:00
JOE …umm… so really allowed me like I might be a good counselor… 

00:14:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:05
JOE …you know and this is a path maybe that I wanna… 

00:14:05
HMM…HMM…  

00:14:10
JOE …look into and explore and ah… and I was also able to get myself to look at me where I was at in my life. 

00:14:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:20
JOE You know and do I want to continue to do this for the rest of my life or do I wanna do something else and… 

00:14:20
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:25
JOE …it really allowed me to give me that drive to say like alright I want… I wanna go more into the counseling profession. 

00:14:30
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:14:30
JOE So… 

00:14:30
KAY RICHARDSON Wonderful. So now after having taken the journey of doing all the work that it takes to get through grad school and you’re… you’re toward the end of that… 

00:14:40
JOE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:40
KAY RICHARDSON …as you think back on that original passion that got you into it, where are you now with that passion… passion about working with adolescents in foster care? 

00:14:50
JOE Umm… It’s there, you know it’s… it’s… that passion is there. And… And as I said like I… I work within the school districts here in San Diego. And so I know when I do my work with the adolescents in the middle schools and elementary, there is a lot of heart of work that's there and so… 

00:15:05
KAY RICHARDSON A lot of… say that again. 

00:15:10
JOE Heart like… 

00:15:10
KAY RICHARDSON Heart work, yeah. 

00:15:10
JOE So I do a lot of… 

00:15:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:15:10
JOE …I work with my heart. 

00:15:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:15:15
JOE And so that’s where my passion comes. 

00:15:15
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:15:15
JOE And so I know that’s a community that… that I do, I wanna continue to do work with… 

00:15:20
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:15:20
JOE Umm… 

00:15:20
KAY RICHARDSON As you look at what you learned in that original job with the foster care adolescents and now in the school district, has your passion or your clarity refined anymore based on those experiences as you’re now gonna take the birds out if you’re looking at… at all of that wealth of experience you bring? 

00:15:40
JOE Umm… it… if it has, I would have to say that umm… within school dis… within the school districts working with… with those those students and… and that those youths is how I am finding myself bringing families together. 

00:16:00
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:16:00
JOE So… 

00:16:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so you’ve added that since… 

00:16:05
JOE Added… yeah, I have added that so… 

00:16:05
KAY RICHARDSON …since the original job, okay. 

00:16:10
JOE …where in foster… foster youths there, it was just the youth. 

00:16:10
KAY RICHARDSON You and the adolescents, okay. 

00:16:15
JOE Yeah, me and the adolescents and that was it. And so now I am seeing myself it’s more the adolescents and… and their families and… 

00:16:20
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:20
JOE …working with them to establish a more of a stronger connection and a bond. 

00:16:25
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:25
JOE So that’s what I see that’s different. 

00:16:30
KAY RICHARDSON And so… as you are looking at that, okay I’ve added the families, I am still working with adolescents what… what out all of that is most fulfilling for you? 

00:16:45
JOE Umm… I think what’s fulfilling is to see my… my students and their families talk to one another. 

00:16:55
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… So the family work. 

00:16:55
JOE Yeah, it’s the family work. 

00:16:55
KAY RICHARDSON Is that kind of rising to the top at this point? 

00:17:00
JOE And knowing that it’s okay to talk with one another and… 

00:17:00
KAY RICHARDSON hmm… 

00:17:05
JOE …and slowing things down you know, I think I’ve… I’ve seen that in when I do family work, it’s a lot of how are you feeling with this and… 

00:17:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:15
JOE …or let’s… let’s see how you know maybe your brother or sister is feeling… 

00:17:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:20
JOE …or mom, like how… how are you doing mom? 

00:17:20
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:20
JOE And dad where are you right now dad? And so it’s really bringing, creating this bond with the families. 

00:17:30
KAY RICHARDSON So when you say slowing it down, making space for everybody’s perspective… 

00:17:30
JOE Yeah. 

00:17:30
KAY RICHARDSON …to come in, nice, okay. 

00:17:35
JOE umm… and just also that part of listening. 

00:17:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:35
JOE Can we just listen… 

00:17:35
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:17:35
JOE …you know… 

00:17:40
KAY RICHARDSON It’s like a novel concept for… yeah. 

00:17:40
JOE You know and it’s hard for some of these families because they’re just very reactive… 

00:17:45
KAY RICHARDSON Yes. 

00:17:45
JOE …you know… 

00:17:45
KAY RICHARDSON Yes. 

00:17:45
JOE …and it’s on the go, on the go, on the go… 

00:17:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:50
JOE So but yeah. 

00:17:50
KAY RICHARDSON And I… I remember you mentioned at the beginning, you were considering Latino families. Are any of these families Latino? Is that… there any…? 

00:17:55
JOE Umm… there is a… it’s a pretty diverse. I… There is Latino families. There is African-American families, I work with Asian families. So and I’ve noticed that a lot of it ah… there’s a… there’s a connection within all… all the families that I work with is the the connection in a sense that they wanna be closer together, but they just… they don’t know how. 

00:18:20
KAY RICHARDSON Sure. 

00:18:20
JOE …you know… 

00:18:20
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:18:20
JOE …and… and like I go back to listening again it’s modeling or even a… 

00:18:25
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:30
JOE …acknowledging that listening is… is the first step. 

00:18:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:30
JOE You know in regards to coming together. 

00:18:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:35
JOE So, but yes, so it’s just not only with Latinos but like I said… 

00:18:40
KAY RICHARDSON You work with all these different population. 

00:18:40
JOE Yeah, all of the population. 

00:18:40
KAY RICHARDSON So in terms of helping you clarify you know more about your passion, more about your direction umm… you said at the beginning, okay, I’m thinking about adolescents, I’m thinking about families, I’m thinking about Latino families in particular, is this job giving you any information about umm… that piece of Latino families be in a specialty or is it more or you are more realizing why I just like working with diverse populations. 

00:19:05
JOE Well, you know I’ve… I love to work with diverse population, but I also feel and this is just me in the sense of wanting to… to work more with Latino fathers and sons. 

00:19:25
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:19:25
JOE Umm… and then I’m not saying that that’s not… shouldn’t be worked with others… 

00:19:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:35
JOE …but I… I wanna say and I think it’s just more of my opinion(ph)… 

00:19:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:35
JOE …and my… more of my culture and I… I feel more comfortable with that is that I’ve done work in creating fathers and sons to… to be together and to be with each other… 

00:19:50
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:19:55
JOE …you know, has been really powerful, so I know there is a definite, like in my mind, when I'm saying like yes, like yes, that’s what you wanna do… 

00:20:00
KAY RICHARDSON Really? 

00:20:05
JOE …yeah, like you wanna… you wanna do work with Latino fathers and sons. 

00:20:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:20:10
JOE So I know that. 

00:20:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, so cool. So I’m thinking let’s capitalize on that… 

00:20:15
JOE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:15
KAY RICHARDSON In this next section, I invite Joe to imagine his ideal vision without limits. We now ask if he is ready to commit to his vision and what would be the next easy step for moving forward. 

00:20:30

00:20:35
KAY RICHARDSON So if you’d like umm… just sit back for a second and just take a few deep breaths and close your eyes Joe, and in your own time and just allow that spark about working with Latino fathers and sons to just kind of grow within you for a moment, within your mind’s eye, within your heart. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:10
KAY RICHARDSON And then just allow yourself to begin to envision what would my ideal look like? If there were no limits, what would I ideally love to see happen? If Latino fathers and sons with my career, just allow that picture to begin to develop within you.

00:28:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:28:10
JOE …and setting that up. 

00:28:10

00:28:15
KAY RICHARDSON Next step okay. 

00:28:20
JOE Yeah, I need to go with that. 

00:28:20
KAY RICHARDSON If you were to break that piece down into just what will be just the next easy step of like something you could do this, week what might that look like? 

00:28:30
JOE Umm… sharing more my vision with others. 

00:28:35
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, okay.

00:28:55

JOE You know I have this vision. 

00:29:00

00:29:05
JOE And how can I put the things into place. 

00:29:05
KAY RICHARDSON Yes, yes. 

00:29:05
JOE You know so it’s ah… yeah it’s… oh, yeah, it’s definitely… it’s all there you kno, now I am just thinking more of it, it’s like a… yeah… 

00:29:15
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:29:15
JOE The hope is there and it’s just I think my… one thing just allowing myself to acknowledge it and… and talk about it and share it. 

00:29:25
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:25
JOE So… 

00:29:25
KAY RICHARDSON Good, good. Well I am excited for you. 

00:29:30
JOE Umm… 

00:29:30
KAY RICHARDSON Really. 

00:29:30
JOE I am excited. 

00:29:30
KAY RICHARDSON Oh, yeah. 

00:29:35
JOE Yeah. So it’s… it’s a good feeling. 

00:29:35
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:29:35
JOE It’s definitely a good feeling. 

00:29:40
KAY RICHARDSON So at the beginning of the conversation you see you know I want… I want more clarity, more sense of direction. So I just want to check in how you are feeling on that. Does this feel like you’ve gotten what you wanted to get out of the conversation or is there any piece more? 

00:29:50
JOE If anything I am wondering more of where I sit with because I talked about families and I’ve talked about adolescents and… and fathers and sons. 

00:30:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:05
JOE And being a marriage and family therapist I’m wondering where I am with couples working with couples. 

00:30:15
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:30:15
JOE You know and otherwise see myself like what type of work do I want to do with… with couples in regards to whether it’s healing the relationship, you know, not wanting to be with each other or so that’s just where I find myself kind of what do I want… what do I wanna be with couples you know. 

00:30:40
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. Good question. So when you think about the clarity of this vision that you are so inspired about with fathers and sons being the theme. And then you think about okay where do I want to be with couples, how does this clarity that you were just feeling about this center and fathers and sons shed any light on couples work? 

00:31:05
JOE Umm… I think, now that I’m sitting… not placing limits on this center that I’ve created. 

00:31:15
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:31:20
JOE And so even opening it up to… to mom and dad or just couples in general. 

00:31:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:30
JOE You know having a place they can go to… to just to be in interact… 

00:31:35
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:31:35
JOE …with each other. Ah… in a… and I don’t know how that would look yet, but just more of them being able to interact with each other in a different space. 

00:31:50
KAY RICHARDSON So when you think about like your heart and your passion is… is your heart and passion behind that piece of the vision of having couples you are working with couples? 

00:32:05
JOE Ah… it’s not as strong as it was. 

00:32:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay, as it was. 

00:32:05
JOE …as with another it was with the… 

00:32:10
KAY RICHARDSON As it was with the fathers and sons, okay. 

00:32:10
JOE Yeah, with fathers and sons. 

00:32:10
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:32:15
JOE So it’s… it’s… there is some… 

00:32:15
KAY RICHARDSON It’s in there but… 

00:32:15
JOE …some joy there but it’s not as strong as SD. 

00:32:20
KAY RICHARDSON SD. Okay, so I want to have that how you like to use that information, you know to inform… 

00:32:25
JOE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:30
KAY RICHARDSON …to inform your vision, to inform your priorities about how you carry this out. You know what I am saying? 

00:32:35
JOE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:35
KAY RICHARDSON I am not going, okay. There is nice much hot and passion behind that piece. When you brought up couples, was it because you are thinking well I’m… I’m getting all the courses in couples therapy, I should be able to do that too, is that…? 

00:32:50
JOE Yeah, exactly. Oh yeah and then just a whole like a systems like… 

00:32:50
KAY RICHARDSON Yes. 

00:32:55
JOE A lot of my background comes from like systems work and… 

00:32:55
KAY RICHARDSON So there is a need for the whole family. 

00:33:00
JOE For the whole family. But then I’m also… as I’m talking more to you and as I’m processing more… 

00:33:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:05
JOE I’m also thinking that maybe is just not there yet and that’s okay. 

00:33:10
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:10
JOE Umm… that the… the passion is there, maybe it’s just not in a place where I can feel it… like feel the intensity more yet like… 

00:33:25
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Because… have you done much work with couples? 

00:33:25
JOE Ah… I haven’t like… 

00:33:25
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:33:25
JOE …you know I mean I have seen clients here and there like a couple of clients… 

00:33:30
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:30
JOE …but in regards to wanting to know how… how I wanna be with them and what makes sense for them. 

00:33:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:40
JOE I think it’s definitely knowing that it’s in the… I have it here in my heart. 

00:33:40
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:45
JOE When I am just knowing that in time, it’ll… it’ll happen, it’ll come. 

00:33:45
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:45
JOE and trust in that I wanna say. 

00:33:50
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah, that’s good. It’s good to give yourself room to let it develop naturally. 

00:33:55
JOE Yeah and also kind of just I wanna sit with that more now… 

00:33:55
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:00
JOE …that I’m… I’m thinking about it… 

00:34:00
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:00
JOE …and rushing… rushing into it and finding myself, oh this is what I wanted to do. 

00:34:05
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:05
JOE So just slowing it down. 

00:34:05
KAY RICHARDSON Cool like you do with the families. 

00:34:10
JOE Yeah. 

00:34:10
KAY RICHARDSON So you can listen to yourself. 

00:34:10
JOE Exactly. 

00:34:10
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah. 

00:34:10
JOE Yeah. 

00:34:10
KAY RICHARDSON Nice. 

00:34:10
JOE Got to. 

00:34:15
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:34:15
JOE Yeah. So… 

00:34:20
KAY RICHARDSON So will… Does this feel like a natural stopping point to the conversation? Or is there anything more that you loved to get out of this? 

00:34:25
JOE Ah… I feel good now. I am really glad that I was able to share my passion. 

00:34:35
KAY RICHARDSON Umm… 

00:34:35
JOE You know and… and hear myself talk about it. 

00:34:35
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:40
JOE I think was very validating like you know empowering actually. 

00:34:40
KAY RICHARDSON Really? 

00:34:45
JOE That’s the word empowering like go out and do your work you know. 

00:34:45
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:45
JOE They could happen. Everything seems like everything is in place for me. 

00:34:50
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:50
JOE And it’s just a like I said verbalizing it, verbalizing it more and letting… letting everything start happening. 

00:35:00
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:00
JOE So I… I definitely… I really like the visualization because… 

00:35:05
KAY RICHARDSON Okay. 

00:35:05
JOE …that really got me to slow it down and to really open myself up to… to that like kind of like to tap into and say like alright. 

00:35:15
KAY RICHARDSON Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:15
JOE That’s… here it is. 

00:35:15
KAY RICHARDSON What is it really? 

00:35:15
JOE Yeah. 

00:35:15
KAY RICHARDSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:20
JOE So I am… I’m really feeling as I came here in a different place and it was great. 

00:35:25
KAY RICHARDSON Wonderful. 

00:35:30
I end with the art of acknowledgement and I share with Joe what genuinely touched me from his vision and this is most effective when using the client’s language. 

00:35:40
Art of acknowledgement •genuine •using client’s language 

00:35:45
KAY RICHARDSON And I… my heart is touched in… in hearing your vision and just thinking about all the lives that would be impacted that have already been impacted by your work and that are going to be in the future. I think this center is a beautiful idea because there is such a need for that bonding especially with fathers and sons, you know with all the… the challenges that young men have growing up and all of the invitations to go in a negative direction you know to have their father there can be such a valuable thing and I can hear how you have been like a father to… to… 

00:36:25
JOE Yeah. 

00:36:25
KAY RICHARDSON …some of these young men and I really honor you for your contribution to humanity. 

00:36:35
JOE Thank you. 

00:36:35
KAY RICHARDSON It’s powerful.
