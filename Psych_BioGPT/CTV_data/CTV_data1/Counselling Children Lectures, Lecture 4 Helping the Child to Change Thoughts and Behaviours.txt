00:00:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Hello, I'm Dr. Kathryn Geldard. In the previous lectures in this series, I have talked about ways to join with the child to help them to tell the story and to get in touch with and release emotions. However, this may not be sufficient to enables the child to function adaptively in the long term. Often children, who are emotionally troubled, develop unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving. Unfortunately, these unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving will not necessarily change spontaneously once the child has told the story and been in touch with unreleased emotions. If we're to help a child feel better in the long term, we also need to help them to learn new ways of thinking and behaving. Today, I'm going to describe a number of ways of helping a child to change their thoughts and behaviors. However, before I do, I would like to remind you about the use of feedback when counseling children. 

00:02:00
The use of feedback statements 

00:02:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I'm sure that you have noticed that in my previous lectures, I have on many occasions suggested giving the child feedback of what I have observed while the child has been working with media. Feedback statements provide an alternative to asking questions. Naturally, as counselors, there are frequently times when we need to ask questions, however, a problem with asking questions is that the child is likely to directly reply to the question and in doing this they may be taken away from talking about something important that does not relate to the question. In my experience usually when I give the child feedback of what I have observed, they're likely to talk freely without feeling constrained by the need to answer a particular question. Consequently, in my view giving feedback statements of observations is much more likely to encourage the child to keep talking than asking questions. 

00:03:15
Helping the child to change thoughts & behaviours 

00:03:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In this lecture, I will describe the following strategies, which I find useful in helping a child to change their self-perception, thoughts and behaviors. The fruit tree exercise to help change a child self-perception, challenging unhelpful beliefs to encourage the child, to improve in more useful thinking processes. The comic strip exercise to help the child choose between adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. The stop-think-do process and the monster-in-me strategy to help the child interrupt to tendency to engage in an unhelpful behavior. The use of worksheets to address social skills and protective behaviors.

00:04:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Let's start by looking at the fruit tree exercise. 

00:04:30
The fruit tree exercise 

00:04:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The fruit tree exercise is useful in phase III of the spic model, where the emphasis is on helping the child to change their self-perception, so that they see themselves more positively. This is important because frequently children, who have experienced emotional problems will also have developed maladaptive behaviors. Unfortunately, these behaviors will be seen negatively by other children and adults. And as a consequence, the child will have difficulty in maintaining good relationships with other children and is likely to be criticized by adults with the result that the child's self-image will be damaged and they will start to see themselves negatively. This is where the fruit tree exercise can be used with the effect. To do the fruit tree exercise, the child needs some colored felt pens and a plain sheet of drawing paper. The counselor can then gives the child, the instruction and want you to imagine that you are a fruit tree and then to draw picture of yourself as the fruit tree. While the child is drawing, it is sensible for the counselor to remain quiet or possibly to give feedback about what they, the counselor are observing with regard to the activity, the colors being used or the ease of drawing the tree. For example, the counselor might comment on the choice of colors available and there attractiveness. Once the child has finished drawing, it is the counselor's task to process the work. To demonstrate how to do this, let's imagine that this is a child's drawing of themselves as a fruit tree. 

00:06:40

00:06:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD After they had finished drawing their fruit tree, I asked the child to imagine that they really are the fruit tree. I then say "Fruit tree, what can you tell me about yourself?" The child might say, "I'm a tall tree." I would then ask, "Can you tell me more." The child might respond by saying, "Some of my fruit is falling off." I would then ask "Is there anything else you can tell me about yourself as a tree?" The child might say, "Yes, I've got lots of green leaves." I would then tell the child what I noticed about the tree. I might say, "I noticed that you also have some small branches. Or I noticed that these leaves are different from these leaves over here. Or I noticed you have three strong roots." By feeding back what I noticed it is likely that the child would disclose more about themselves as the tree. I would then ask a number of questions such as these: "What kind of tree are you? Do you have fruit? What happens to your fruit? What's it like to have your fruit fall to the ground? Do you have flowers? Do you have many flowers or just a few? What do you look like in the winter? When the wind blows, what's it like for you being the tree? Do you have prickles on your branches? Do you have large leaves or small leaves? As a tree, do you grow next to other trees or are you on your own? What's it like being on your own? Who looks after you?" In response to these questions, the child would be likely to tell me more about themselves as the tree. Whenever they answered, I would encourage them to use, I statements rather than to refer to the trees something separate from themselves. For example, if the child says, "The tree likes being in a field on its own." I would remind the child that they have to imagine that they are the tree and asked them to say, "I like being in a field on my own." The answer to these questions, gives the counselor information, which can then be compared with the child's life. Because this exercises metaphorical, it is very likely that if the child joins with the exercise enthusiastically, that they will inevitably project ideas about themselves onto the tree. Consequently, the fruit tree exercise can be very useful in enabling the child to get in touch with unrecognized personal strengths. The counselor can search for positive elements by extending the metaphorical process. For example, the counselor might say, "What stops you from blowing away in a very strong wind." Finally, having reminded the child that they and the tree are one and the same. I would draw her(ph) attention to those strengths, which had been identified. I would make connections between qualities exhibited by the tree and strengths that the child had demonstrated in their life. Having used an activity such as the fruit tree to help the child to perceive themselves more positively as is appropriate in phase III of the spic model. It is then appropriate to move on to phase IV. It may be that while doing a fruit tree exercise, the child as well as recognizing the strengths, disclosed some beliefs about themselves that we're unhelpful. For example, the child might believe that they were not clever enough or that they were responsible for violent behavior between others. In phase IV, we can help the child to challenge such unhelpful believes. 

00:12:00
Challenging unhelpful beliefs 

00:12:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It is almost inevitable that children who have emotional problems will develop beliefs that are irrational. As described by Albert Ellis, who is the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy or believes that are at the very least unhelpful. If a child is to start to behave differently, firstly, they will have to start to think more positively. Let me give you an example. Can you remember how in a previous lecture, I described a young girl called Amy, whose emotional problems stemmed from feeling displaced in the family by her baby brother. Amy had at least two unhelpful believes. One unhelpful belief was that she believed that her parents didn't love her and most importantly another unhelpful belief was that she believed that her brother had displaced her in the family. In Amy's case, both of these beliefs could well have been incorrect and we're certainly unhelpful. However, we do need to be careful not to challenge beliefs that are based on accurate information. If it had been true that Amy's parents didn't love her, then instead of challenging the belief, we would need to help Amy deal with the sad reality that her parents didn't love her. And to help her to make sensible decisions about how to behave, so that life would be more comfortable for her. However, if I believe that Amy's parents did love her; I might ask her, what led her to believe that they didn't. Amy might indicate that they were often angry with her. I would explore the logic behind Amy's thinking and invite her to consider alternative believes. I would raise her awareness of other possible believes, which in some way, she may be overlooking or failing to identify. For example, I might ask her whether she thought that her parents might be finding it very tiring, now there was an extra person in the house. Reframing the way a child persuades this situation, helps them to view their world more constructively. Do you notice that this is done by accepting the child's picture, but then expanding it to included additional information, so that the child can perceive the situation differently. I would ask her, what her parents would need to do to convince her that they did love her. I would then setup a joint session with her and her parents, so that they could explore their relationship more fully and talk about what they each needed. So that they could all feel more comfortable. Amy's belief that her brother had displaced her in the family would be central to her emotional problems and would be certain to result in unhelpful behaviors by Amy in the family. I would encourage her to think about what she needed when she was her baby brother's age and what she needed now. If I had previously in phase III of the spic model, use the fruit tree exercise with Amy, I would refer back to the strengths she had discovered in herself. As she recognized that she was getting older and more capable. I would try to help her to be proud of herself as the elder sister, who is capable of the times looking after and teaching her younger brother as he grew up. My goal would be to help Amy to change her unhelpful beliefs about her family. So that instead of seeing herself as displaced, she would see herself as having an important role in the family as the eldest child. By helping her to think differently about her role in the family, it is possible that she would no longer need to continually engage in a tension-seeking behavior and would feel more comfortable in the long term. However, because she had used unhelpful behaviors for a while, she might continue to use them unless they were directly addressed. Consequently, once we have addressed the child's self-destructive beliefs, it is important to help them to look at their options and choices with regard to their behavior. There are number of ways of doing this including using the comic strip exercise. 

00:17:20
The comic strip exercise 

00:17:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Many comic strips that we see in the newspaper have a sequence of three frames, which tell a story like this. 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In the comic strip exercise, we use the three frames differently. In the first frame, at the left-hand end of the comic strip, the child is encouraged to draw sketches or to use abstract symbols to represent particular behaviors, which are causing problems for them. In the third frame, at the right-hand end of the comic strip the child is encouraged to draw sketches or to use abstract symbols to represent alternative behaviors, which are likely to produce more positive outcomes and which could be used in place of the unhelpful behaviors that had been illustrated in the first frame. In the centre frame, the child is encouraged to draw a self-portrait. I will use an imaginary case to illustrate the comics strip. Imagine that I have been counseling a boy called Adam, who is continually getting into trouble at home for punching his sister and for deliberately throwing things and breaking them when he is angry. Clearly, before using the comic strip, I would have helped Adam to tell me his story and to get in touch with and release his angry emotions. However, even though he had been through this counseling process, Adam might continue at times to hit his sister and to throw things and break them when he is angry, because this is the way he has learned to respond to his frustration over a long period of time. Obviously, he need to learn how to replace those unhelpful behaviors by more helpful ones. The first step in the process would be for me to talk with Adam about those behaviors of his that I know get him into trouble. I would also check out with him whether there were any other behaviors that he could think of that get him into trouble. I would then ask him to draw sketches in the left-hand frame of his comic strip to illustrate these problematic behaviors. I would explain to him that I would like to help him to avoid getting into trouble and I realized that these behaviors are problem for him. The left-hand frame of Adam's comic strip might look like this. Notice in the left-hand corner, Adam has drawn a stick picture of him punching his sister. Once Adam had drawn this, I would ask him what might have happened before he got angry and punched his sister. He might say, "she takes my things and she is always teasing me." I would explain to Adam that while I understand that his sister might be very annoying and provocative that provocation does not justify abuse. And punching his sister is abusive. Moreover, I know that punching his sister gets him into an awful lot of trouble. And I would like to help him to avoid getting into trouble. I would then invite Adam to draw two other pictures in the left-hand frame. One to show his sister taking his things and another to show her teasing him. I would remained Adam that his parents have told me, that he will often throw and break things when he gets angry. Particularly, when his parents won't let him do what he wants or won't give him what he is asking for. I would ask him to add a picture to the left-hand frame of himself throwing and breaking things. The unhelpful behavior frame might now look like this. Next, I would look at each of Adam's sketches in turn and explore with him things that he could do that would have better outcomes for him. Things that he could do instead of punching his sister and instead of throwing and breaking things. I would ask Adam to draw sketches in the right-hand helpful behaviors frame to illustrate the alternative behaviors that he could use. I would initially encourage Adam to think of helpful behavior himself. And after that I would tentatively like suggestions of other behaviors that I thought might be useful and would discuss these with him to see whether or not he agreed. Adam might draw sketches like these. This picture shows Adam walking away from his sister without responding to her when she teases him. This drawing here shows him talking to his mother explaining that his sister has taken one of his possessions without permission. This other picture shows Adam going into his bedroom when he is really angry and shutting the door, lying on his bed imagining that the mattress represents his anger. The picture shows him pummeling the mattress while repeatedly saying "I hate being angry. I hate being angry." This is a way for him to let his anger out without hurting anyone or damaging anything. With regard to this last strategy, counselors do need to use caution. Sometime I'm asked by new counselors whether or not, it is good idea to encourage angry children or young people to release their anger by punching, a punching bag. I believe that there is a real danger in encouraging children or young people to do this, to get rid of anger. Punching a punching bag is too similar to punching another person. By hitting the punching bag, they may just learn how to hit harder and may at some stage in the future hit a person instead of the punching bag when they became really angry. Throughout our work with angry children, we need to stress that hitting other people is not okay. And that it is also abusive to frighten people by throwing things, breaking things, slamming doors, yelling and banging things loudly. In a picture over here, Adam has gone to visit one of his friends, so that he can get away from his sister. Down here, he has gone for a long ride on his bike. When using the comic strip strategy in this way, it is almost always important to suggest to the child that it would be a good idea to show their parents the comic strip or at least to talk to their parents about the new behaviors they would like to use. If they don't do this, their parents might inadvertently undermine their attempts to use the new behaviors. Also, the parents may need to set in place some rules for both the child and other members of the family. In Adam's case, the parents would need to explain to his sister that it is not okay for her to take his things without his permission and that if she did do this, then they would expect Adam to tell them. Also, they might need to set boundaries, so that his sister did not go into his room after he had shut the door when he wanted to be on his own to vent his anger privately. His parents would need to be clear with him about how he would need to ask permission if he wanted to go to visit a friend or to ride his bike in order to escape from the troubling situation. Once the child had completed drawing pictures in the unhelpful behaviors and helpful behaviors frames, the next stage is for the counselor to ask the child to draw a picture of themselves in the central frame. Thus, Adam's comic strip might now look like this. The final stage of the comic strip process involves helping the child to recognize that they have choice about what they do. Firstly, I help the child to explore the various consequences, which might result from the behaviors displayed in all the pictures. I deliberately avoid trying to pressure the child into believing that they should always behave in the way that is described by the pictures in the helpful behavior's frame. In fact, I will say sometimes, you might deliberately chose to do the things that you have drawn in the unhelpful behavior's frame knowing that by doing them, you are likely to get into trouble. At other times, when you recognize that you are about to do one of the things described in the unhelpful behavior's frame, you will recognize that you have a choice that you can do this if you want to, but that you don't need to, instead you can do something from the helpful behavior's frame. The choice is yours. I will fully explore with the child what it would be like to be about to engage in one of the unhelpful behaviors and then to deliberately choose to engage in one of the helpful behaviors. I would be careful not to minimize the difficulty with which the child might experience in letting go of the unhelpful behavior and replacing it by a hopeful behavior. Sometimes, I encourage the child to draw a large comic strip on a roll of paper and then stretch it out and place it on the floor. I might then ask the child to initially stand in the center self-portrait frame, and then as we discussed particular behaviors, invite them to move between the left frame and the right frame as they consider which choice fits best for them. This movement emphasizes the child's responsibility for choices by adding another dimension to the exercise. Once I had completed the comic strip process, I would ask the child, "Would you like to show your comic strip to your mom or dad? Or would you like to keep it private?" I would explain that there might be an advantage in showing strip to mom or dad, as I may be able to help. For example, if dad notice that Adam was just about to start to use an unhelpful behavior, he might be able to tip him off and suggest a helpful behavior instead. I would ask Adam, "Would you like dad to help you in this way or not?" Once again, the decision would be the child's. You might wonder why I had put such an emphasis on giving the child the opportunity to make choices. I do this, because I believe that there is much greater chance of success in changing behavior if the child themself believes that they have the choice and are capable of taking responsibility for that choice. In this regard, I would give the child encouragement by saying "I think that sometimes, it will be difficult for you to choice a helpful behavior." But I think you will probably be able to do this quite often. What do you think? At a later counseling session, I might check the child's success in choosing helpful behaviors and assuming that there has been a level of success, congratulate the child by saying well done. I thought you could that. The comic strip process works well with many children. However, we need to recognize that some children are extremely impulsive and need help in managing their impulsive behavior. Although, we will not succeed in replacing unhelpful behaviors by helpful ones. There are two strategies that we can use with children to help them learn self-management skills. For younger children, the Monster-in-me strategy can be very useful and for older children, the stop-think-do process can be effective. Let me talk about these strategies. 

00:31:45
The MONSTER-in-me strategy 

00:31:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The Monster-in-me strategy is particularly useful for those children who impulsively act out their anger. The first step in the process is to do what the narrative therapists call externalizing the problem. What I do is to explain to the child that as they know their parents have told me that they get into a lot of trouble. I explained that I don't think that it is their fault that they get into a lot of trouble. I think that it is the monster that lives inside them that gets them into a lot of trouble. It's the monster's fault. Now, when you here this, you might be troubled, because you might think that I'm absolving the child from responsibility for their behavior. It certainly appears to the child that I'm doing that. But in fact I'm not, because I will subsequently make it clear that it is the child's responsibility to control the monster. I say to the child, "I think you get into trouble, because this, this monster that lives inside you usually the monster is sound asleep and when he is at sleep, he shrinks and becomes very, very small, so small that he's smaller than a pinhead. Now, I think that when you start to get angry, the monster wakes up. and he starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. He then takes over and does the most terrible things. He throws things around, he kicks, he punches, he yells and he screams and as a result, you get into an awful lot of trouble and that isn't fair. The monster just go back to sleep and doesn't get into any trouble at all, but you get into trouble. Now, I wonder if you can draw me a great big picture of the monster that lives inside you with these felt pens." When the child has finished drawing a picture of the monster, I ask them to draw picture of themselves on another sheet of paper. I then ask them to put a dot on their picture of themselves to show me where they think the monster lives inside them. "Does the monster live in your stomach or in your head or somewhere else?" I might ask. I will usually say to the child, "You seem like a pretty tough kid. However, I think this monster is pretty tough too. Is this monster tougher than you or you tougher than the monster? Who is the boss? Are you the boss or is the monster the boss?" Obviously, I encourage the child to believe that they are the boss and usually they will tell me this anyway. Next, I explain to the child that I think this monster is very sneaky. I remind the child that I think that it is the monster who gets the child into trouble, which doesn't seem big. I suggest that the monster sneaks out all of a sudden without the child realizing until it's too late. I remind the child that the monster wakes up, grows big, and comes out when they're starting to get angry. I'll ask, "What's the first thing that happens when you start to get angry? Do you go red in the face? Do you clench your fists? Does your hair stand on end? What happens to you?" My goal is to help the child to recognize the physiological clues, which precipitate an angry outburst. At this stage, I might suggest to the child that because the monster is so sneaky, we need to have mom or dad's help in order to make sure that the child remains the boss. I' will invite the parent to come into the room and I talked to them about my theory that the monster is to blame, but that I believe that the child is capable of being the boss in controlling the monster. I will ask the parent for their suggestions of ways in which they might be able to let the child know that they think that the monster is about to sneak out. Often, this will be in the way of a secret symbol or sign, because the child will not want other members of the family to know that they're being tipped off by their parents that the monster is coming out. Then, I suggest the use of the star chart, where the child gets a star in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If they succeed in being boss of the monster during that period, and make it clear that if the monsters beginning to come out and the child succeeds in controlling the monster that they would definitely get the star, because even though the monster was beginning to come out, they were successful in being the boss. I then encourage the parent and child to negotiate a reward, which the child will get if they succeed in getting a certain number of stars during the week. I try to ensure that the number of stars required is not too high during the first week, so that it is likely that the child will succeed. I usually use a star chart for a second week also, but not for longer. Because, in my experience the effectiveness of star charts quickly diminishes after the first couple of weeks. The monster-in-me strategy can be very helpful with younger children, but will be seeing as childish by elder children. With older children, it is better to use the stop-think-do process in order to address impulsive behavior. 

00:38:25
The Stop-think-do strategy 

00:38:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It is a good idea to start the stop-think-do process by encouraging the child to make two lists. One list of those behaviors that result in negative consequences and the other list of those behaviors that result in positive consequences for them. The process I use comes from William Glasser's Reality Therapy. I will explain that they can choose to engage in those behaviors that result in negative outcomes or they can choose those behaviors that result in positive consequences. I will stress that they have the ability to make their own choices about how they behave. However, their choices inevitably have consequences either positive or negative. I will let the child know that I believe that they will sometimes impulsively behave in a way, which has negative consequences for them and then wish they hadn't. I'll then write the word "stop, think and do" on a whiteboard or sheet of paper like this. 

00:39:50
STOP! THINK DO 

00:39:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I will explain that if they're able to stop and pause for a second or two before acting, they will have time to think about their possible choices and to make a choice about the way they want to behave taking into account the likely consequences. I will say that I know that sometimes it is difficult to stop and in order to help them stop, they need to be able to recognize when their emotions are building up to a level, where they might act out without stopping and thinking first. I think the monster-in-me strategy, I would(ph) check out with the child, the psychological indicators that can be used to let them know that they are about act out. What is it that that they notice about their body when their emotions are starting to rise. I will write these things down on whiteboard or sheet of paper. I will reiterate that if they're able to stop before acting out, they will have time to think to make a choice taking into account the likely consequences and to do something which has positive consequences for them rather than negative ones. In some situations, it can be useful to involve parents as in the monster-in-me strategy, so that the parents are aware that the child is intending to try to use the stop-think-do process. This puts the parents in a position where they can help their child to recognize the signs that they are about to act out. Another way to help a child to let go of unhelpful behaviors and start to use more helpful ones is to use worksheets. Worksheets are also useful in enabling children to address social skills and develop protective behaviors. 

00:42:05
The use of Worksheets 

00:42:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD There are a number of worksheets in the book counseling children, which my husband and I have written. You're welcome to photocopy these worksheets for your own personal use when working with children. Here is an example of a worksheet, which is included in the book. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It is important to remember that worksheets are merely tools, which enable the counselor to engage in conversation with the child around particular issues. It is the conversation related to the content of the worksheet, which is most useful in producing change. 

00:42:55
The tutorial 

00:43:00
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD If you attend the tutorial following this lecture, which is described in the lecturer's manual, you will have the opportunity to experience and practice some of the strategies, which I have described in this lecture. In order to participate in the exercises, you will need to bring with you some colored felt pens and paper. 

00:43:30
In conclusion 

00:43:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD In this series of lectures, I have only covered some of the strategies, techniques, media, and activities that are useful when working with children. If you've found these lectures interesting, then you might wish to learn more by reading the book counseling children, which my husband David Geldard and I have written. I hope that you have found these lectures interesting, useful, and enjoyable.
