Celebrating Cultural Diversity Celebrating Cultural Diversity: A Group for Fifth Graders Group Facilitators: Sam Steen Ph.D. and Sheri Bauman Ph.D. 

00:00:25
SHERI BAUMAN Hello. I am Sheri Bauman. 

00:00:30
SAM STEEN And I’m Sam Steen. 

00:00:30
SHERI BAUMAN And we are going to be filming a demonstration group with fifth grade students. There are six students, three boys and three girls from a local school and the goals of the group is to increase their awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity and maybe sensitivity to those aspects of themselves and others. Just that to, to give you a little background of on our thinking about that, Niloufer Merchant of St. Cloud State University talks about multiculturalism in groups in three ways. There are cultural specific groups so that you might have a group for African-American students or immigrant students… 

00:01:20
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:01:25
SHERI BAUMAN …Or Latino adolescents or it’s possible to do a group focused on multicultural issues like the one we are doing. 

00:01:35
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:01:35
SHERI BAUMAN This one is the group of diverse kids who we want to help appreciate value the diversity they bring. 

00:01:40
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:01:45
SHERI BAUMAN And the third type of group is a group that has some other focus; divorce or whatever… 

00:01:50
SAM STEEN Anger management and… 

00:01:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:01:50
SAM STEEN …Social skills. 

00:01:50
SHERI BAUMAN Any of those things where the cultural diversity becomes part of the discussion in the dialogue. 

00:02:00
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:02:00
SHERI BAUMAN And one thing that you’ve taught me Sam is that, it’s really important to be intentional… 

00:02:05
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:02:05
SHERI BAUMAN About bringing up issues of diversity and culture not leave it to chance but as a an aware and skilled and knowledgeable counselor be sure to bring that up as it fits. 

00:02:20
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:02:20
SHERI BAUMAN And then… 

00:02:20
SAM STEEN And some of the strategies are… 

00:02:25
SHERI BAUMAN Right, one of the things that is important for us not to do is make assumptions. 

00:02:30
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:02:30
SHERI BAUMAN That because a child is Korean not to assume we know anything more about them or black or African-American and to let the kids be the experts or the individuals be the experts on their own experience and culture and then finally to create an environment in the group umm…, through the activities and through modeling and through the way we conduct and guide the interactions. 

00:03:00
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:03:00
SHERI BAUMAN So that they feel safe to talk about these things because they are not easy. 

00:03:05
SAM STEEN Right. And, and another thing is to often ask open ended questions and in asking open ended questions, it sort of umm… you are not leading your students or the group members, but you are allowing them to kind of process the information and come up with their own ideas. Umm…, whether you are working with multicultural group, groups or groups in general there is some other things that needed to be considered and some of those are umm… modeling and self-disclosure, planning a group umm… you have umm… 

00:03:40
SHERI BAUMAN Processing both… 

00:03:40
SAM STEEN Processing a group… 

00:03:40
SHERI BAUMAN To both… 

00:03:40
SAM STEEN Evaluating… 

00:03:40
SHERI BAUMAN …With the session with the kids… 

00:03:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:03:45
SHERI BAUMAN …and with the co-leader if you are fortunate… 

00:03:45
SAM STEEN Absolutely. 

00:03:45
SHERI BAUMAN …enough to have one. 

00:03:50
SAM STEEN And then evaluating the group is another one. 

00:03:50
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:03:50
SAM STEEN And the last one I didn’t bring up with screening and selection. So with the screening or let's start with the planning. With the planning, it's important that you are organized, you kind of get all your things together umm… beforehand because inevitably you’re gonna run into some things that you didn’t anticipate and the more preparation you can do ahead of time, the better. In fact, even within sessions and throughout the process you may have to kind of chunk some of them and move onto alternative plan. So it’s important that you plan umm… ahead, where you gonna say something? 

00:04:25
SHERI BAUMAN I was gonna say and I think you implied(ph) that it's important to plan and have a general vision of where you intend to go but it has to be pretty fluid… 

00:04:35
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:04:35
SHERI BAUMAN …because either overall within sessions, you may have to take a total detour. 

00:04:40
SAM STEEN Absolutely. 

00:04:40
SHERI BAUMAN But ah… I think that’s important and I wanted to just say something about the screening for this particular group because we didn’t do the screening, the school counselor did that and we really didn’t meet the students until session one. 

00:04:55
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm, absolutely. 

00:04:55
SHERI BAUMAN So we didn’t have the luxury that the school counselor as of already having a relationship with these students and knowing a lot of background having assessed and… 

00:05:05
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN …selected so this, this ah… demonstration group is a little different in that respect but screening and selection was done just was in us. 

00:05:15
SAM STEEN It was in us, but it was important that when you do typically screening students you wanna make sure that or our group members you let them know sort of what some of the experiences are gonna be? Are they willing to learn new things about themselves or other people? And umm… are they willing to take risk? Because inevitably they are gonna be taking risk. 

00:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN And sometimes just putting… 

00:05:35
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN …and coming into the group… 

00:05:35
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN …is a risk. And it’s important to have you mention the evaluation and we’ve prepared an evaluation that we thought was age appropriate and specific to this group that will be looking at the end of every session. Kind of guide or thinking and those can be unanimous… 

00:05:50
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:05:55
SHERI BAUMAN So the kids can give us clues about whether we are on the right page or not. 

00:05:55
SAM STEEN And there is the processing one that is often overlooked. With processing, with groups umm… sometimes we focus a lot on the activities and the activities are really helpful. Umm… Psycho educational groups in particular you wanna teach something. In this case, we are gonna counseling with groups where we wanna help students kind of reflect and think about and ponder and in doing so they can decide for them what’s the most meaningful umm… and hopefully we’ll show that in our demonstration what we take our time with activities and actually allow the students to respond and think about and reflect on what we've just engage them in, in terms of you know the activity of coloring something or… 

00:06:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:06:40
SAM STEEN …or reading something or whatever. 

00:06:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. The activity is, is just a vehicle… 

00:06:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN …to get at… 

00:06:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:06:45
SHERI BAUMAN …some inner thoughts or new awareness and so forth. So it’s really important that we remember that the activity is not the goal. 

00:06:55
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:06:55
SHERI BAUMAN It’s a way to get to the goal… 

00:06:55
SAM STEEN To the goal, right. 

00:07:00
SHERI BAUMAN …and to be sure to help them by asking the right questions. 

00:07:00
SAM STEEN And there is one more thing. 

00:07:05
SHERI BAUMAN What? 

00:07:05
SAM STEEN Modeling and self disclosure and you and I, we talked about that. 

00:07:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:07:10
SAM STEEN Because we had to decide um, you know how much do you self disclose? For whose benefit? When and why? And how do you disclose, self-disclose? And we know what the modeling we decided that we would actually participate in the activities and that we would umm… as a result have to self-disclose some information and but we were doing it so that the students kind of get what we are trying to ask them to do and then secondly we’ve brought some diversity being that our co-leaders to into this process as well and so we can also add a unique perspective. 

00:07:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right and I think that. 

00:07:45
SAM STEEN Would you agree with that? 

00:07:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right and I think, we're not going to be self-disclosing personal secrets. We are going to be contributing to the flow and, and I think given the difficulty and the fact that this, the topic of culture and diversity is often the elephant in the living room. We are getting it out there and talking about it. So I think we need to model that for the students. So as we go through the group, I, I wanna monitor each other and ourselves or have we used self-disclosure appropriately or have we perhaps misused it? 

00:08:25
SAM STEEN And we will process between every, each and every session from week to week. Is that right? 

00:08:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. That’s right. 

00:08:30
SAM STEEN So with that’s it. Lets begin. 

00:08:35
SHERI BAUMAN Onward. 

00:08:40
Session 1 

00:08:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So, here we are getting ready to start an adventure. We, we have an adventure you are not real sure what’s gonna happen except that’s gonna be fun and exciting and we are going to have six meetings in this group and we are going to have a chance to learn something about ourselves and about each other and about cultures and so forth because anybody here like ice cream. Okay. I kind of thought so, me too. So, how would it be if ice cream was only vanilla? 

00:09:20
hmm… much boring. 

00:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN Boring and how would it be if there was only one song in the whole world? 

00:09:25
Oh! 

00:09:25
Oh! 

00:09:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So when there are lots of different choices and lot, lots of different kinds of ice cream or songs or people, things get more interesting and more exciting and that’s what this group is about to learn to appreciate all those differences. Okay? So we are gonna begin because you guys know each other pretty well and you know your names but Sam and I kind of need a little help with the names and we wanna do something that’s kind of fun with the names. Okay? 

00:10:00
SAM STEEN Yeah exactly, and there are two ways we are gonna to do. The first way we are gonna do is, it is kind of easy and the second time we ask your name and ask you to describe something about yourself and may be the first time you’ve done it so might be a little bit more difficult. Okay? So I will start. First thing you do is just tell me your name, tell us your name and your favorite color. That’s easy alright? 

00:10:20

SAM STEEN Now I did mention at first that, it will get a little bit more difficult, right? 

00:14:45
ALEX (ph) Yes. 

00:14:50
SAM STEEN This time I want you to think about yourself and since today we are talking about celebrating diversity, the differences and some of the similarities that we have uh… we want you to think about not only your name but how you want to describe yourself in terms of your background or your culture and so just pause a minute and think about how you know if you have to refer to someone else's, this is the type of, this is who I'm. How would you say that and I will you an example because it's kind of um… you may have never thought about it. This time umm… I will say, my name is Sam and I'm black and one thing that makes me or something good about being black is, you know I have to think about something that makes me proud or makes me feel good about being black and so let me think for a second. Umm… I know, my name is Sam and I am black and something good about being black is that all of the history associated with the music, I love music you know, written by black people and that represents black people. So that makes me feel good. 

00:16:05
ALEX (ph) That's hard. 

00:16:05
SAM STEEN Just think a little bit. 

00:16:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) What about sports, my name… 

00:16:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:16:10
SAM STEEN Whatever it, exactly. So we don’t have to go in any or and you don’t have to remember every body’s because that would make it almost impossible, but if you can think about something and anybody think own(ph) there any. 

00:16:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph God. 

00:16:25

00:17:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I want something that I'd like been a Russian is that, is that I’ve been in two different country, I know different language.

SHERI BAUMAN What is kind of good about being African-American? 

00:23:00
DORDGE (ph) I don’t know. 

00:23:00
SAM STEEN You can’t think of anything else. Okay. 

00:23:05
SHERI BAUMAN Or maybe else whatever you want (inaudible ) some things… 

00:23:06
Yeah. 

00:23:06
SHERI BAUMAN And if you think… 

00:23:10
SAM STEEN So was that difficult or just that was good. 

00:23:10
Yeah, it's difficult. 

00:23:10
SAM STEEN Why what’s hard about it? 

00:23:15
Thinking now only and… 

00:23:15
Yeah. 

00:23:15
SAM STEEN What you like about and what is difficult (inaudible ), what else made it difficult? 

00:23:20
Nothing. 

00:23:20
SAM STEEN Nothing else. Had you ever thought about how you described yourself before? 

00:23:25
ROMAN (ph) No, not really. 

00:23:25
SAM STEEN Not really. 

00:23:30
SHERI BAUMAN So, that’s why. 

00:23:30
SAM STEEN That’s, that’s part of the reason maybe, but it was really helpful and I think you are doing a great job. 

00:23:35
ROMAN (ph) Yeah sometimes when we start school we have to do the same thing. 

00:23:35
SAM STEEN Huh… huh. 

00:23:35
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

00:23:35
ROMAN (ph) Some people get nervous about this. 

00:23:40
SAM STEEN Uh Huh… Uh Huh… 

00:23:40
DORDGE (ph) Know that you're around the world… 

00:23:40
SHERI BAUMAN Umm... 

00:23:45
DORDGE (ph) Trying to say had every nice name. 

00:23:45
SHERI BAUMAN So you know I mean there is something very interesting that happened and I'm wondering if anybody else noticed it. If we look at Sam and we look at Dordge(ph). They both look sort of the same color but when Sam said, he described himself. What did he say? 

00:24:05
DORDGE (ph) Proud. 

00:24:05
SHERI BAUMAN And when Dordge(ph) did, what did she say? 

00:24:05
African-American. 

00:24:10
SAM STEEN So you notice that too. 

00:24:10
SHERI BAUMAN What do you think about that? It's kind of interesting. 

00:24:15
ILEANA MEIN (ph) That’s really how you describe it. 

00:24:20
SHERI BAUMAN You know and so even people who might look the same may have a different way of thinking about it and even Roman(ph) and I, he described himself as Russian first and then Jewish and for me Jewish was first. So people even when they seem to share the same looks or skin color or heritage may think about it differently and that’s what is exciting is to kind of discover how other people look at the world. So I think that was maybe neat and I appreciate that you guys took the risk. 

00:24:55
SAM STEEN And thank you for doing that. So as we continue lets think about when you begin school normally you have rules. Is that right? 

00:25:05
ALEX (ph)Hmm, right. 

00:25:05
SAM STEEN There is class rules, don't run in the hallway. No talking when the teacher is talking. Where here we don’t really call them rules, we call them noise being like the normal way we want to behave as a group or we can call them sort of the ground rules sort of foundation or something like that. How we are going to interact with each other. So if we had to come up with some ground rules or norms that we would use in the group. Umm… can anybody think of a few that we could kind of agree upon. And I can give you an example, let's say we were all talking at the same time, will it be easy to understand what we are trying to say? 

00:25:45
No. 

00:25:50
SAM STEEN So as a result, is there anything we can agree upon that we can use as a norm. You can say it, no matter… 

00:25:55
ALEX (ph) (inaudible ) talks at a time. 

00:26:00
SAM STEEN Exactly, it’s may be one person talks at a time. Do you all agree with that? 

00:26:05
Yes. 

00:26:05
SAM STEEN That’s very good. 

00:26:05
SHERI BAUMAN And sometimes we both might start talking at the same time and then will have to say, I'm so sorry, you first. 

00:26:10
SAM STEEN Exactly. 

00:26:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Don’t use 00:26:15]inappropriate words. 

00:26:10
SAM STEEN No inappropriate words. Are we okay with that one?. 

00:26:20
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Yes, to respect each other's heritage and ethnicity. 

00:26:25
SAM STEEN Oh, very good to respect each other’s heritage, Daidge(ph) did you hear that one? Heritage and what else did she say? 

00:26:30
DAIDGE (ph) Ethnicity. 

00:26:30
SHERI BAUMAN Ethnicity. 

00:26:30
SAM STEEN Ethnicity. 

00:26:35
SHERI BAUMAN What is that that mean? I just when you respect, but how would we show respect for each other's heritage and ethnicity? 

00:26:40
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Not make fun of each other. 

00:26:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right, you don’t make fun of each other. Even if something they describe is little different than what we were used to, okay. 

00:26:50
SAM STEEN So we have one person talks at a time, respecting each other's cultural heritage and ethnicity and what is the third one? 

00:27:00
No inappropriate words. 

00:27:05
SAM STEEN No inappropriate words. 

00:27:05
SHERI BAUMAN I have one and I think we already started it, which is that we should be able to be honest. So like if you said, I don’t know or I don’t wanna answer that that’s being honest or even Sam that will hurt my feelings I don’t need mean it, but so that we can say what we really thinking and feeling. Okay? 

00:27:30
SAM STEEN That's okay. 

00:27:30
SHERI BAUMAN Will that be okay with everybody to have? 

00:27:30
SAM STEEN Any other ones? There is only that we normally use and it's what they call confidentiality. Are you familiar with that big word? 

00:27:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Confidence. 

00:27:45
SAM STEEN Yeah. Confidence where we share a secret with some body. What does that mean? 

00:27:50
ROMAN (ph) Well it means like you are able to say that. 

00:27:55
SAM STEEN You are able to share some thing right? And then what will happen and what could happen? Go ahead. 

00:28:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) That mean to keep something to yourself for secret. 

00:28:00
SAM STEEN Uh huh, so we what we share here its private information, is that right? However it is a little silly to bring that up because we all have this camera that starring on our faces right. But typically or traditionally we would say what we say in here stays in here with the exception of course you can talk it over with your family and go ahead Sheri. 

00:28:25
SHERI BAUMAN And I was to say we can only just talk about ourselves, but so when I go home tonight and talk to my husband and if he says what did you do? And I will say all we did these need activities and Ileana(ph) told me something that made me think differently, but I don’t share what it is. So that’s the way that you, 'coz our people are going to say, I promise you guys, they do, won't they. So you can answer the question you gonna say everything secret, but you don’t want to share anybody’s special things that they tell(ph), okay. 

00:28:55
SAM STEEN Alright. very good. 

00:28:55
SHERI BAUMAN And we have one, sure it's not really a norm that has seemed like a good time to talk about, I’m going to get a little piece of paper to demonstrate. So give me a second. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
SHERI BAUMAN Have you guys heard of the term a risk that means, what is it means to take a risk? 

00:29:20
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Take a chance. 

00:29:20
SHERI BAUMAN Take a chance and some risks are kind of foolish and it would be foolish to take a risk to jump off a building, but other risks help you grow little bit or learn or whatever. And I call, see this circle, I'm going to call that my comfort zone. Okay? so if I’m right in the middle of my comfort zone that means there is no risk. It means um… I’m not taking any chances. I’m not doing anything new, I’m not nervous like it’s not a risk for me to say my name is Sheri. Okay? but for me when I said and I’m Jewish, that is a little bit riskier for me. So I just kind of get it closer to the edge of my comfort zone, but then I got a chance to learn something or grow a little bit and feel safe saying that, so sometimes we have to take risks to grow and I hope that as our group goes long we are going to be willing to get closer to the edge of our comfort zone. Okay? try something a little new or that makes us a little uncomfortable and sometimes we may even wanted to do this, what am I doing? 

00:30:40
Coming out. 

00:30:40
Just jumping. 

00:30:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, just I’m going a little bit outside my comfort zone. 

00:30:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:30:45
SHERI BAUMAN Now it wouldn’t be smart of me to go way across the room, that’s too much. That’s like jumping off the roof, kind of. But I might want to say something, take some little bit hard for me and now then I'll go back to the comfort zone, okay? so that’s kind of a way to think about this idea of trying something new or different and stepping out of our comfort zone little bit and here. 

00:31:10
SAM STEEN So if you are going to share how comfortable you feel at this point, we want you to take one of these little circles. You can take any color you like and place on the circle how comfortable you are, so again in the middle means, you are comfortable and slightly off or to the side means that you are less comfortable, but you are willing to take risk. Is that make sense? 

00:31:35
Yeah. 

00:31:35
SAM STEEN And maybe I should have some piece of tape on to it. 

00:31:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, we can make a little ball out of the tape on the back and then it will stay. 

00:31:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) So we are gonna say something while we are. 

00:31:50
SAM STEEN No need. 

00:31:50
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! you might, for now we’ll just start up by putting them somewhere in there, what color would you like? Okay. I think I will be yellow. 

00:32:00
SAM STEEN And move this thing later to see at the changes. Here Roman(ph). 

00:32:05
ROMAN (ph) Thank You. 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:15
SAM STEEN Anybody can go first. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:35
SAM STEEN Here go Daidge(ph). Can you give the last one. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:55
SHERI BAUMAN So you are kind of at the edge of your comfort zone. Good for you that’s pretty risky. Who is that right in the middle? Is that you Oligue(ph)? Is there anything that we can do as a group to help you feel safer about moving a little bit out of your comfort zone or towards the edge? You don’t have to, you know, I just wanted to know is there anything we can do to make you feel thinkable. 

00:33:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) No I thought of something. 

00:33:20
SHERI BAUMAN Oh you, okay. 

00:33:25
SAM STEEN So even her question made you think about it, interesting. So we will come back to that later once you're Sheri? 

00:33:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that’s kind of comfort, looks almost like (inaudible ) or something and we have food onto(ph) bring. 

00:33:40
SAM STEEN Say it again. 

00:33:40
You guys have the (inaudible ). 

00:33:42
SAM STEEN Yes we do. 

00:33:42
SHERI BAUMAN Yes and we are going to be using those before too long boy this is a very helpful (inaudible ). 

00:33:46
SAM STEEN Alex(ph) are you saying something like that? Okay chart remember one thing. 

00:33:50
DORDGE (ph) (inaudible ) of this table(ph). 

00:33:55
SAM STEEN Chart, remember what color you have because we’ll let you use the same color next time. 

00:33:55
Okay. 

00:33:55
SAM STEEN So one more thing we like to do or two more things before we end this session is we to leave in might be a lot of fun to see if we can come up with a name for this group. 

00:34:05
SHERI BAUMAN Because we were talking that our individual names, that now what would be a name for the group? 

00:34:10
SAM STEEN For the group? Oligue(ph) just came up, what did you said? 

00:34:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Sam. 

00:34:15
SAM STEEN Oh the Sam, I thought you said sea or a moon. 

00:34:20
SHERI BAUMAN Lets think for a minute. Anybody have a puppy or a pet do you ever have to come up with a name. 

00:34:30
Yeah. 

00:34:30
SHERI BAUMAN How do you do it? How do you think of the name for something. What’s the… 

00:34:30
DAIDGE (ph) Random. 

00:34:35
SHERI BAUMAN Random you just go and it comes to you? 

00:34:35
DORDGE (ph) It’s kind of sit in top of our head. 

00:34:40
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So we will see if something comes in any other you find any? 

00:34:40
ALEX (ph) My catty likes to follow the shadows, so that’s how you will do? 

00:34:45
SAM STEEN Ah… 

00:34:45
SHERI BAUMAN So I like the source of the… 

00:34:45
SAM STEEN So surprised. 

00:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN Something that describes really does. 

00:34:50
DAIDGE (ph) My cat is orange so I named it tiger(ph). 

00:34:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay so the color what else? 

00:34:55
DORDGE (ph) I mean, our dog princes because she thinks she is the boss of the other dogs. 

00:35:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. So that the way they behave, the way they look, what they do, what color so… 

00:35:10
SAM STEEN And then if you don’t have an animal maybe (inaudible ) the animal right? and how do you come up with the same thing how don't you come up with the name for yourself… 

00:35:20
SHERI BAUMAN But just think of use those ideas. What would be a good name for this group? 

00:35:25
DAIDGE (ph) I have a idea for that and actually, if we weren’t comfortable we should go to the line… 

00:35:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, that’s what we will do. We are going to take it out. 

00:35:30
SAM STEEN That’s a great idea. 

00:35:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay talk to each other. We are not going to be quite at this. We wanted to be your… 

00:35:40
Friendship. 

00:35:40
SAM STEEN Friendship. 

00:35:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Safe. 

00:35:45
SAM STEEN Safe. 

00:35:45
SHERI BAUMAN Heaven. 

00:35:45
SAM STEEN (inaudible ). 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
DORDGE (ph) Kids from soul. 

00:35:55
ALEX (ph) Kids from soul. 

00:35:55
SAM STEEN Kids from soul. 

00:36:00
ROMAN (ph) We can accept. 

00:36:00
SHERI BAUMAN Something kind of catchy you might even use it for the name for the film, you know so think of that kind of a catchy fun name. 

00:36:15
SAM STEEN Just think it Ileana(ph) . what about you? 

00:36:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well you know it sounds like some times before you realize that your cat is it that likes your shadow. Had it, it’s be around her little bit right. So it may be that we decide that we are not ready to name this group yet because we haven’t been a group long enough and we you know we are gonna make, take a little time. What do you think? Will that be… 

00:36:50
Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:36:50
SAM STEEN Do you think about it? 

00:36:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:36:50
SAM STEEN You know between now and next week or the next time we meet, how about that? 

00:36:55
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

00:36:55
SAM STEEN Okay. We have one more thing to do, is that right? 

00:37:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, one of the things that I think um, we wanna make kind of a ritual at the end of our sessions to um, compliment each other we let each other know, something that we appreciate it or liked about them today in the group? So we are gonna, the way we are gonna do it is one person will start and for this time I will and I’m going to compliment someone and then that person can compliment someone else and then person compliment someone else and so everybody has (inaudible ) compliment. 

00:37:41
SAM STEEN And when you receive, when someone says something to you what sort of a nice response that. 

00:37:45
Thank you. 

00:37:45
SAM STEEN Absolutely to say thank you and the other thing is when you give a compliment we, we willing to try to say their name first. So you are actually talking to that person. So do you wanna show them… 

00:38:05
SHERI BAUMAN I was thinking that’s what I was going to do but I wonder if someone else wanted to start instead of you and I always starting. Does someone else want to start? 

00:38:10
DAIDGE (ph) I will start. 

00:38:15
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… Dordge(ph) because she really didn’t wanna say what her character and (inaudible ) she did? 

00:38:21
SHERI BAUMAN Very good. Can you tell her. I mean now you were talking about her and let's start practicing in saying that and that was really unique one thank you. 

00:38:30
SAM STEEN So you are asking them to say directly to her or is that… 

00:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN I think just let's try to… 

00:38:35
SAM STEEN Good job. 

00:38:35
SHERI BAUMAN …in the future that’s a great one? So now it's your turn. 

00:38:40
Hmm… 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:55
SAM STEEN Anything that you can think of. 

00:39:00
DORDGE (ph) Hmmm… Alex(ph). 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:25
SAM STEEN Compliments are hard. Aren’t they? If I want to say to you, I want you to think of something really need of saying to someone, you will be able to say easily. 

00:39:35
Ha…ha…ha. 

00:39:35
SAM STEEN You have a big no, you are sure. So I wasn't pointing you to share it. Ha…ha…ha. 

00:39:40
Ha…ha…ha. 

00:39:40
SAM STEEN But it is difficult to say and even as she said your name, I saw you kind of, it’s kind of new to feel this way when someone gives you a compliment right? But you can do it Dordge(ph) let's see? Anyone have an idea for Dordge(ph) that maybe… 

00:39:55
SHERI BAUMAN Something that will be nice to say. 

00:40:00
SAM STEEN For Alex(ph)? 

00:40:00
Ha…ha…ha. 

00:40:05
SHERI BAUMAN Is that you are nervous? 

00:40:10
DORDGE (ph) Ah… I liked how he scared to tell um… 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:25
ROMAN (ph) Ha…ha. 

00:40:30
SAM STEEN I think I'm nervous to get you people to say. 

00:40:30
ROMAN (ph) Ha…ha…ha. 

00:40:35
SAM STEEN You said Alex(ph). You said you’d like how she was afraid to say. 

00:40:40
ROMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:50
SAM STEEN Was it the activity were we are gonna share the, share her name and what she responds. 

00:40:55
Uh…Huh. 

00:40:55
SAM STEEN And so she said that she was… 

00:41:00
DORDGE (ph) To say her culture and her, where her parents were. 

00:41:05
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:41:05
ALEX (ph) Thank you. 

00:41:10
DORDGE (ph) You are welcome. 

00:41:10
Can me say something about some… 

00:41:10
SAM STEEN Not yet, it's Alex's turn. 

00:41:15
ALEX (ph) Oh yeah. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:35
ALEX (ph) Daidge(ph). 

00:41:35
SAM STEEN Start with Daidge(ph) first, he has to get it last because then you will give another compliment. 

00:41:40
ALEX (ph) Okay. 

00:41:45
SHERI BAUMAN Or if that you merely want a compliment, you could pass the next turn along someone else, how about that? 

00:41:50
DAIDGE (ph) Okay. 

00:41:50
SAM STEEN Okay, it’s a great idea. 

00:41:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:41:55
ALEX (ph) Daidge(ph) because he, he was going to take risk out of the circle. 

00:42:05
DAIDGE (ph) I like it down. 

00:42:05
Thank you. 

00:42:10
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And which one is the blue. I like Dordge(ph) because she was she is almost down in the circle. 

00:42:25
SHERI BAUMAN And that means what? 

00:42:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) That means she is going to… she is bit nervous that and she is risking to think(ph). 

00:42:35
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:42:35
SHERI BAUMAN Great. 

00:42:35
SAM STEEN Great. 

00:42:35
DORDGE (ph) I think I'm. 

00:42:40
SHERI BAUMAN So when you get to pick someone else who hasn’t had the turn. 

00:42:45
DORDGE (ph) uh, Ileana(ph) . 

00:42:45
DORDGE (ph) I like… 

00:42:45
SHERI BAUMAN No, no, no it is her turn. It's you are in (inaudible ) yeah, you just pass it your turn along. 

00:42:55
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Sam, I want to compliment you because you know, like you like your own heritage. 

00:43:00
SAM STEEN Oh thank you. 

00:43:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) You welcome. 

00:43:05
SAM STEEN I didn’t have time to think about it before you guys. Hmm. So Roman(ph) have you got in with there. Roman(ph), I would like to compliment you on being friendly to everybody and trying to get everybody to participate. 

00:43:20
ROMAN (ph) Thank you. Ah… I want to compliment Sheri because she has a same heritage and religion as me. We were both Jewish, she seems like expressing our thoughts. 

00:43:35
SHERI BAUMAN Thank you and I want to thank and compliment the whole group because everybody… 

00:43:40
SAM STEEN Did everybody get one? 

00:43:40
Hmm…hmm. 

00:43:40
SHERI BAUMAN So that and ah… we could hear everybody and everybody was using the norms even before we decided what they were. 

00:43:50
SAM STEEN Who did Ileana(ph) , I'm going to hear you once. Who gave Ileana(ph) . She passed that to you. 

00:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! Well then begin. 

00:44:00
ALEX (ph) I don’t think Oligue(ph) got one too? 

00:44:05
SHERI BAUMAN Oh boy! I really don’t… 

00:44:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Well did you give him a compliment? 

00:44:05
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

00:44:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Don’t know. 

00:44:10
SHERI BAUMAN So what shall we do that? 

00:44:10
And one thing about… 

00:44:10
DORDGE (ph) So you will give one to Oligue(ph) and Oligue(ph) give one to Ileana(ph) . 

00:44:15
SAM STEEN It’s a great idea. 

00:44:15
SHERI BAUMAN Thank you. Oligue(ph) I really appreciate… you can pass it but I really appreciate the explanation that you gave us about the naming and the way things work in Russia as the naming that your dad’s name as your middle name, it's real different so I've learned something and thank you. So who is, who hasn’t… 

00:44:40
DORDGE (ph) Ileana(ph) . 

00:44:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay you get one too… 

00:44:45
SAM STEEN Do you have one for Ileana(ph) . 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I like to, ahm… something I like about her is that, is that she… 

00:45:05
SAM STEEN Look at her. 

00:45:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Ah, half American, half Mexican. She do know different language just like me… 

00:45:15
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Thank you. 

00:45:20
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) …a little bit. 

00:45:20
SAM STEEN Very good. 

00:45:20
SHERI BAUMAN Very cool and you know what something was happening while we were doing this and I’m not real sure I get it, did you get it? 

00:45:25
SAM STEEN Not really. 

00:45:30
SHERI BAUMAN You people were moving things around so help me understand what that what we were doing here. 

00:45:35
ROMAN (ph) When we say a compliment it kind of changes your feelings. 

00:45:35
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! 

00:45:40
SAM STEEN Really meaning and made you more comfortable? 

00:45:40
ROMAN (ph) No, it's between more and bad. 

00:45:45
SAM STEEN Ah… I see. So you are taking a risk while saying these things that also. 

00:45:45
SHERI BAUMAN So yeah, risk means it’s a little uncomfortable. 

00:45:50
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:45:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I think everybody took a risk today. 

00:45:50
SAM STEEN Yes. 

00:45:55
SHERI BAUMAN Everybody stepped closer to the edge at least once and sometimes we went back to our safe place in the middle and I think this is a great start I can hardly wait for next week when we have our next session. 

00:46:05
SAM STEEN Alright. 

00:46:05
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody have anything that you are dying to say before we end. 

00:46:10
Bye 

00:46:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay good, bye see you next week. 

00:46:15
See you next week. 

00:46:15
SAM STEEN Good job. 

00:46:20
See you next week. 

00:46:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

00:46:25
Discussion 

00:46:30
SAM STEEN So what do you think? 

00:46:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! Some surprises huh! 

00:46:35
SAM STEEN Uh…huh. Which one is that come in your mind? 

00:46:35
SHERI BAUMAN I was bit surprised that for several of them identifying their cultural… 

00:46:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:46:45
SHERI BAUMAN …heritage was difficult. 

00:46:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:46:50
SHERI BAUMAN Umm… so and the difficulty with the name did you feel okay about scraping after this time and… 

00:46:55
SAM STEEN Which part? I think that was a great idea. We talked a little bit about what happens if maybe it's too early to even name the group. But back to your point, I wasn't necessarily surprised that and we didn’t talk about the prompt of, you know do the color thing first and then the name… 

00:47:10
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:47:15
SAM STEEN As I begin to look at the group dynamic you could tell that a throw on their this whole question about who are you? and where you are from? Or your cultural background may have been challenging umm… so fortunately there were couple of people took a risk… 

00:47:30
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:47:30
SAM STEEN And then they were encouraging to the others so you have ah… Dordge(ph) was little uncomfortable, Alex(ph) and Daidge(ph) and again, Alex(ph) it could have very well been the first time she is had to kind of decide a term for her. 

00:47:45
SHERI BAUMAN And it is interesting that you chose mixed… 

00:47:50
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:47:50
SHERI BAUMAN Rather than one or the other. 

00:47:50
SAM STEEN Yeah. One or the other or pass them by racial category that may be we place on this. We could have placed on her so, you are right. I wasn’t that so surprised but it was very interesting to see. 

00:48:00
SHERI BAUMAN And they're also pleased some of the kids just even initially my impression was that they were going to be very reserved and will, but I didn’t see that they all seemed engaged, so we didn’t have to prompt silent ones or calm down over eager ones so that part. 

00:48:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, it was a pleasant surprise. 

00:48:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:48:25
SAM STEEN Yeah, they seem they're engaged very quickly. Would you agree with that? 

00:48:30
SHERI BAUMAN I don't. 

00:48:30
SAM STEEN Yeah. What about the activity where the circle was still there and they interacted the compliment. 

00:48:35
SHERI BAUMAN I know. 

00:48:40
SAM STEEN They weren't even… 

00:48:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and I’m not sure that this is clear to them. We may have to because we talked about comfort… 

00:48:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:48:45
SHERI BAUMAN …and risk. 

00:48:45
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. It wasn’t clear to me that after… 

00:48:50
SHERI BAUMAN I know so that’s what they were going back and forth so we may wanna, may do one or the other. 

00:49:00
SAM STEEN Or the other thing is that regardless of how clear it was, their interpretation of it was clear it seemed as if because, Roman(ph) even explained what was happening. 

00:49:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I thought… 

00:49:10
SAM STEEN You know. 

00:49:10
SHERI BAUMAN …that was really interesting. 

00:49:10
SAM STEEN And he got the umm… the ambivalence between the two well it's fun to hear but it sound difficult so, I don’t know we’ll see. We see it next week. 

00:49:15
SHERI BAUMAN And we’ll decide next time when he comes up we might want to just do one to ten if we want to get a read on comfort, but that is interesting that they ended up into putting it differently… 

00:49:25
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

00:49:25
SHERI BAUMAN But it's just, you know we’ve never, we’ve been friends, we’ve been colleagues, we’ve been co-authors. We’ve never been co-leaders of a group. How do you think that work? How did we do? 

00:49:35
SAM STEEN I think it worked quite well fortunately we do have a relationship you know, professional and we’ve already had this sort of relationship. So it was easy to umm… be on the same page and we’ve worked together enough to know like, and also if, if you recall we did discuss our leadership styles… 

00:49:55
SHERI BAUMAN Good. 

00:49:55
SAM STEEN …ahead of that which I think was helpful too, so that you know that, you know just the differences between the two, but they seem to umm… compliment each other quite well. 

00:50:05
SHERI BAUMAN I really umm… I really like your creativity that you quickly picked up okay, what we had planned is a little too you know, ah… heavy. 

00:50:20
SAM STEEN Heavy. Uh… huh… exactly. 

00:50:20
SHERI BAUMAN We’ve got a backup or and I felt comfortable and hope it was okay to you, with you. 

00:50:25
SAM STEEN I saw your body language that you felt comfortable with me doing that I felt relieved that you are okay with that and you kept that I mean it didn’t miss the beat and I think we had negotiated like you would do this activity and I would do this one and we bolted them. 

00:50:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:50:40
SAM STEEN And so that worked well. 

00:50:40
SHERI BAUMAN And I, I jumped in at one point you know, let's calm this for now or help then and I felt safe to do that and so if that’s not okay tell me now before the next. 

00:50:55
SAM STEEN Its perfectly fine, so how do we proceed, what are your thoughts for the next session? 

00:50:55
SHERI BAUMAN I think that what we planned actually is right on. I don’t know about the other ones, but for the next one because there are more umm… 

00:51:05
SAM STEEN Giving a coin it. 

00:51:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah and that I think the diversity being one will be kind of fun for them and do we have the, this is the potato? 

00:51:15
SAM STEEN I think so. 

00:51:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I think that will funny. So… 

00:51:15
SAM STEEN So. 

00:51:20
SHERI BAUMAN So little wider um… and… 

00:51:25
SAM STEEN Interactive. 

00:51:25
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:51:25
SAM STEEN There was… 

00:51:25
SHERI BAUMAN And I think we just need to keep paying attention to the process. 

00:51:30
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN Which I thought we did pretty well. 

00:51:30
SAM STEEN There was one student who or one kid who are that was tired, but then he made a comment that you know, he was right on and I can't it was Daidge(ph) right 

00:51:40
SHERI BAUMAN Daidge(ph). 

00:51:40
SAM STEEN Right, but I don’t remember the comment. Do you remember? 

00:51:45
SHERI BAUMAN I know one was his, his compliment to Dordge(ph)… 

00:51:45
SAM STEEN Oh… yeah. 

00:51:45
SHERI BAUMAN …that she had, you know done something risky and difficult. 

00:51:50
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm…hmm and another one was when you were describing the activity and you were standing on the edge and he was looking on everything and then the question was posed and he said "oh! you mean you are taking more risk, you are almost outside" and he had missed the beat. 

00:52:00
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:52:00
SAM STEEN So that’s good to know that that may be his personality. 

00:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:52:05
SAM STEEN Huh, but he is engaged. 

00:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN So I think he is sort of wiggly and… 

00:52:05
SAM STEEN Uh…huh. 

00:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN …and all of that yeah. 

00:52:10
SAM STEEN But definitely (inaudible ). 

00:52:11
SHERI BAUMAN Both times yeah. Meanwhile this was little risky for me. 

00:52:15
SAM STEEN In which part? 

00:52:15
SHERI BAUMAN Just the whole you know, my whole heritage is not something I typically talk about. So I could relate to the kids and maybe, that’s okay. 

00:52:20
SAM STEEN It is okay. 

00:52:25
SHERI BAUMAN It is okay with you. 

00:52:25
SAM STEEN It is fine with me. I like the fact that Dordge(ph) represented herself African-American and that the you all picked up on the fact that I consider myself black. I’m proud to be African-American that interchangeable, but when I’m given the opportunity to say one or the other I always choose black. 

00:52:40
SHERI BAUMAN And I think that was maybe, I don’t know how, how salient that distinction was for them. But I wanted them to really, not every Mexican-American says that even they can say Hispanic, Latino, Chicano that were like, you know so I wanted to which we didn’t plan but it… 

00:52:55
SAM STEEN Right. 

00:53:00
SHERI BAUMAN …represented itself so. Well, I think we for now… 

00:53:00
SAM STEEN hmm…hmm. 

00:53:05
SHERI BAUMAN Are you okay with going our next week’s plan? 

00:53:05
SAM STEEN That the only, definitely we will proceed how we had initially planned. One thing we didn’t do that we should do umm… I don’t know if we do it at the beginning or the end. But to have them, we have them checking with the compliments but we didn’t have the, we didn’t evaluate what they felt they’ve learned or anything like that. 

00:53:25
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:53:25
SAM STEEN In writing, just for the future reference 

00:53:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! Yeah exactly we even have a form for them to do it. 

00:53:30
SAM STEEN Exactly and they can do it in between the session. They can do it between our next week and bring it back but we know that it's very helpful to get that initial feeling of… 

00:53:40
SHERI BAUMAN Right. 

00:53:40
SAM STEEN How they feel and then collect them and just be done with it. So we will try to end with that. 

00:53:45
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe. 

00:53:45
SAM STEEN Before they say they are like any last thing you want to say and then they say it like bye…bye whatever, we can complete this and then. 

00:53:50
SHERI BAUMAN Actually I’m going to get some keep me here and that will help with the memory. 

00:53:55
SAM STEEN We will just keep them right there. 

00:53:55
SAM STEEN Okay, so until next time 

00:53:55
SHERI BAUMAN Good luck. 

00:54:00
SAM STEEN Okay. 

00:54:05
Session 2 

00:54:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, you are welcome back. I hope it's been a good week for everybody. 

00:54:10
Oh yeah. 

00:54:10
Yeah. 

00:54:10
SHERI BAUMAN And how about we just kind of give each other a signal about how the week was. If your week was terrific, thumbs up. If it was just kind of this way and if you got really rotten week, I hope no one Oh! 

00:54:25
SAM STEEN You guys are kidding. You had rotten week. 

00:54:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I don’t… I had excellent Sunday. 

00:54:30
SHERI BAUMAN Oh dear… 

00:54:30
ROMAN (ph) It's middle between well(ph) and rotten. 

00:54:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, well Ileana(ph) I'm little worried about that, what was so hard about your week? 

00:54:35
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I did fell. 

00:54:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! you have recovered, mostly. 

00:54:45
SAM STEEN You really did. You all were playing tag is that right. 

00:54:45
SHERI BAUMAN And Oligue(ph) you had a crisis? 

00:54:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I’m moved to, I went(ph) for my dad. 

00:54:55
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! Oh! that was really hard. 

00:54:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Hmm…hmm. 

00:54:55
I think all you (inaudible ) was terrific. 

00:55:00

00:55:00
ALEX (ph) Oh! and, and… 

00:55:05
SHERI BAUMAN And so you had both, what was your goodness? 

00:55:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I finished two video games. 

00:55:10
Ha…ha. 

00:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! That’s exciting. You wanna tell us about your thumbs down? 

00:55:15
DORDGE (ph) Umm… well, I didn’t have a good day. 

00:55:20
SAM STEEN You didn't have a what? 

00:55:20
DORDGE (ph) Good day. 

00:55:20
SAM STEEN You didn't have one? 

00:55:20
DAIDGE (ph) (inaudible ). like the (inaudible ). 

00:55:26
SAM STEEN Is that right? 

00:55:26
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

00:55:26
SAM STEEN Don't research you got tagged, I see. 

00:55:30
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, well I hope that umm… once we get started today those things, won't be quite as important. Oligue(ph) is there anything you need from the group to be comfortable to get started. 

00:55:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I think I can do care with myself. 

00:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay great. 

00:55:45
SAM STEEN If you don't mind Alex(ph), was your hand this way or this way? 

00:55:50
ALEX (ph) This way. 

00:55:50
SAM STEEN Do you wanna share what happened? 

00:55:55
ALEX (ph) No. 

00:55:55
She got sick. 

00:55:55
SAM STEEN Oh! You aren't feeling well. 

00:56:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) What did you have to do get better? or you need to be… 

00:56:05
Excellent… 

00:56:10
ALEX (ph) (inaudible ). 

00:56:11
SHERI BAUMAN Ah… the magic solution. Okay. 

00:56:15
ROMAN (ph) How was your day? 

00:56:15
SAM STEEN My day was fine. I had a good day. My weeks, always, still I was in Vegas(ph), I thought I'm in the Vegas(ph). 

00:56:25
DAIDGE (ph) My parents are going to Vegas(ph), and then I won’t (inaudible ). 

00:56:26
SAM STEEN And then, you are gonna what? 

00:56:26
DAIDGE (ph) And they're gone to Vegas and I'm in not your team. 

00:56:30

OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I went to Vegas on June 4th to see my grandma. 

00:56:35
SAM STEEN So your family there. 

00:56:35
ROMAN (ph) Up and down at the same time. 

00:56:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) In few weeks… 

00:56:40
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:56:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I think in two more weeks. My grandma was calling to come to see. 

00:56:45
SAW STEEN Umm… 

00:56:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And she was going to will be with us for a few days. 

00:56:55
SAM STEEN So that sounds exciting and Roman(ph) you were saying. 

00:56:55
ROMAN (ph) Up and down, we went to Los Angeles just you or not to Los Angeles but San Diego to see(ph), I couldn't pretty much do anything there, all I did was like (inaudible [00:57:085]) and that's it. 

00:57:10
DORDGE (ph) So you skip school. 

00:57:10
ROMAN (ph) No we went on the weekends. Ah… 

00:57:15
SAM STEEN Thanks for sharing. Okay… 

00:57:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah… so now that we kind of heard about our week's, we can put them aside and get real present and be in the room because we have some very existing things to do today. 

00:57:25
SAM STEEN Before we start, can I ask you what is one thing you remember about the last session that we have, ahh… 

00:57:30
DAIDGE (ph) The circle thing over there. 

00:57:30
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

00:57:35
SAM STEEN What about the circle thing? 

00:57:35
DIADGE (ph) The thing where we moved it and how comfortable we are in the circle? 

00:57:40
SAM STEEN Okay so you remember that the safe zone and how comfortable we are? Well Roman(ph) what were you thinking? 

00:57:45
ROMAN (ph) I was gonna to say the same thing. 

00:57:45
SAM STEEN The same thing, okay. Anything else? Ileana(ph) . 

00:57:50
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Well, we learned about each other. 

00:57:50
SAM STEEN So, that, that was important to you what we learned about each other. Very good. Alex(ph)? 

00:57:55
ALEX (ph) Same thing as Ileana(ph) . 

00:57:55
SAM STEEN Oh! we learned about each other. Go ahead Dordge(ph). 

00:58:00
DORDGE (ph) We learned about yourselves. 

00:58:00
SAM STEEN So, you remember learning about ourselves and taking about ourselves, Daidge(ph). 

00:58:05
DAIDGE (ph) What everyone said how about their culture and themselves. 

00:58:10
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. So people talking about how they describe themselves and their culture. Are you interested? 

00:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN Even I didn’t remember that, I'm sorry. 

00:58:15
SAM STEEN Go ahead. 

00:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN I just broke the norm when I spoke right while Sam was talking. I remember that that was a little bit challenging for us. (inaudible ) so we took some risks, right now we are in our first session, Roman(ph). 

00:58:30
ROMAN (ph) I remember that we wanted to come up with a group name and that we were talking about like norm or rules. 

00:58:35
SAM STEEN Hmm… 

00:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

00:58:35
SAM STEEN very good. 

00:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN Good idea, so we are keeping in the back of our heads if somebody gets an inspiration like (inaudible ), shadow or something happens or anything that would be a good name. 

00:58:45
SAM STEEN Oh! it will be good name. 

00:58:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, but we have some very interesting test for today. 

00:58:50
SAM STEEN So, today we would like to continue doing some activities that may be you'll find fine and maybe you'll find a little challenging, but in the end hopefully you get to know a little bit more values yourself in other people in here. Alright? 

00:59:00
ROMAN (ph) Hmm…hmm. 

00:59:00
SAM STEEL So, let's begin. This first one we are not really exactly sure the name of it. We call it umm… diversity beans. Take one and pass it on. 

00:59:15
SHERI BAUMAN Just take the set right now okay. 

00:59:20
SAM STEEN I think we've enough for everybody. So let's see. Okay, so everyone has one. If I were to ask you, which one of these jelly beans do you think will taste like white grape? What do you think?Daidge(ph)? 

00:59:35
DAIDGE (ph) The white one? 

00:59:40
SAM STEEN The white one. Hmm. The yellow one what do you think that will taste like Ileana(ph) ? 

00:59:45
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Lemon 

00:59:45
SAM STEEN May be a lemon alright. 

00:59:45
ROMAN (ph) Or banana. 

00:59:50
SAM STEEN Or banana, interesting. What about, which one will taste like lime?. We think out… 

00:59:55
The green one. 

00:59:55
SAM STEEN The green one and how about the red one. What you think Oligue(ph)? 

01:00:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Cherry. 

01:00:05
SAM STEEN Cherry. 

01:00:05
SHERI BAUMAN And what about the black one? 

01:00:05
Licorice. 

01:00:10
SAM STEEN Licorice, maybe grapes(ph). 

01:00:10
Alright. 

01:00:10
SAM STEEN Like raspberry. What do you say Dordge(ph)? 

01:00:15
Licorice. 

01:00:15
SAM STEEN Licorice. 

01:00:15
DORDGE (ph) Something nasty. 

01:00:15

SHERI BAUMAN Right and then your next favorite kind of. 

01:00:40
SAM STEEN Like it if you wanna put it in the bag, put in your hand or you can just move around in the bag and then line it up. 

01:00:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) So what did you say the white one? 

01:00:50
SAM STEEN The white thing we thing may taste like white grape. So then you order, you write…

SAM STEEN My red one tasted like… 

01:02:25

01:02:35
ILEANA MEIN (ph) White, white.

SAM STEEN So did it taste like grape? 

01:02:40
ILEANA MEIN (ph) No. 

01:02:40
SAM STEEN Something different. 

01:02:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) The yellow one tasted… 

01:02:45
SAM STEEN But orange did taste like orange. 

01:02:45
SHERI BAUMAN What did it taste like? 

01:02:45

01:02:55
Lemon taste… 

01:02:55
ROMAN (ph) A kind of like a grape fruit. 

01:02:55
SAM STEEN So slightly different than you thought it would taste. 

01:03:00
SHERI BAUMAN So given what just happened what do you expect in your next one? 

01:03:05
Pretty good. 

01:03:05

01:03:05
ALEX (ph) I don’t know 

01:03:05
SAM STEEN Ileana(ph) … 

01:03:05
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Umm… My next one is the red one, I think it will be the same as Dordge's and Sheri's… 

01:03:15
SAM STEEN Because they are… 

01:03:15
ILEANA MEIN (ph) …because they have the red one. 

01:03:15
SAM STEEN tasted it. 

01:03:20
SHERI BAUMAN You do? What would you like to call it? 

01:03:20
DAIDGE (ph) (inaudible ). 

01:03:23

01:03:40
ROMAN (ph) Oh no, it doesn’t the red one doesn’t taste like a cherry. 

01:03:40
SAM STEEN Oh! 

01:03:40
Oh it doesn’t. 

01:03:45
SAM STEEN You got a white one. 

01:03:45

01:03:45
SAM STEEN I taste much as like licorice. 

01:03:45
Mine is like lemon 

01:03:50
But green doesn’t really taste like (inaudible ). 

01:03:52

01:04:05
DIADGE (ph) White. 

01:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN So your white one tasted lemon? 

01:04:05
SAM STEEN My white one tasted like a licorice. 

01:04:10
SHERI BAUMAN My white one tasted like… 

01:04:10
The green one… 

01:04:10
SAM STEEN Licorice. 

01:04:10
DORDGE (ph) Not like licorice. 

01:04:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) The green one tasted like lemon. 

01:04:15
SAM STEEN You were lucky. 

01:04:20
SHERI BAUMAN Should we do one more? 

01:04:20
SAM STEEN Hmm… Maybe I’m not a little (inaudible ). 

01:04:25
Lets go. 

01:04:25
SAM STEEN I’m afraid of the black one. 

01:04:30
ROMAN (ph) Me too. 

01:04:30
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Tangerine. 

01:04:35
[sil.] 

01:04:40
SAM STEEN No, black one is good. 

01:04:40
DORDGE (ph) He is black. 

01:04:45
DAIDGE (ph) Spit up on the garbage. 

01:04:50
SAM STEEN Okay now think about that. when we first started you tasted one did it taste like you thought it would taste? 

01:04:55
No. 

01:04:55
SAM STEEN So some cases yes, but in some cases no, alright Ileana(ph) . 

01:05:05
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Some of them taste the same. 

01:05:05
SAM STEEN Some of them taste the same, even though they look a little bit different. 

01:05:05
DORDGE (ph) I got them mine and my white one. 

01:05:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) I got. 

01:05:10
SAM STEEN Dordge(ph) did you hear what Ileana(ph) said. 

01:05:10
DORDGE (ph) Yeah. 

01:05:10
SAM STEEN Say it again. 

01:05:10
ILEANA MEIN (ph) Some of them tasted same. 

01:05:15
SAM STEEN They taste the same even though they look slightly different. 

01:05:15
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) My orange tasted like orange. 

01:05:20
SAM STEEN So it looked orange and it also tasted orange. 

01:05:20
ROMAN (ph) Mine is just like grape fruit. 

01:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN So sometimes they orange tasted like orange, sometimes it tasted like something else. 

01:05:30
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

01:05:30
SAM STEEN Oligue(ph) did you hear Alex(ph)? 

01:05:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Hmm…hmm. 

01:05:35
SAM STEEN Say it again Alex(ph). 

01:05:35
ALEX (ph) I don’t want to taste any of that. 

01:05:35
SAM STEEN Alex(ph) is afraid to even try that. Well, if we would imagine that these beans were people right. 

01:05:40
DAIDGE (ph) White people? 

01:05:45
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:05:45
DORDGE (ph) But we have the same one for that. 

01:05:50
SAM STEEN But Oligue(ph) imagine, Oligue(ph) imagine that these were people. Do we all look the same? 

01:05:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) No. 

01:05:55
SAM STEEN Do we ever, well I ask you that easier, a more difficult question. 

01:06:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Are we all same. 

01:06:05
SAM STEEN When you see a person can you really tell who that person is or what they are like based on the way they look? 

01:06:10
No. 

01:06:10
SAM STEEN Probably no, some times. Tell me more about that? 

01:06:15
ROMAN (ph) Let's say like go about the personality. 

01:06:15
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

01:06:15
ROMAN (ph) If their neat and nice. 

01:06:15
DAIDGE (ph) Yeah, you can judge people like that. 

01:06:20
Like African-American. 

01:06:20
SAM STEEN So you sometimes you first see him and then you judge him. 

01:06:25
DAIDGE (ph) Accurately African-American because their skin color is darker than us, not as like white. 

01:06:30
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm and what about it? 

01:06:30
DAIDGE (ph) They are like darker and like and we people call them African-American or something. 

01:06:35
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm, but the, so if you see a person and they are African-American, their skin is darker what do you think about it? Roman(ph). 

01:06:45
ROMAN (ph) I personally don’t care. I just care about the personality. 

01:06:45
SAM STEEN So you get to know the person. 

01:06:50
ROMAN (ph) Yeah, I don’t care about their skin color. I just care about their, how they act and what the personality is? 

01:06:55
SAM STEEN So doesn’t matter what color? What were you gonna say Ileana(ph) and then Oligue(ph)? 

01:07:00
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I can't judge a book by its cover. 

01:07:00
SAM STEEN Have you heard that before? 

01:07:00
ROMAN (ph) Yes. 

01:07:05
SAM STEEN You can't judge a book by its cover. Oligue(ph) what were you're gonna to say? 

01:07:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Like if you see a white person, it's um, you think it’s the white person is going to be like, you know if you meet a black person you think it's going to be African-American. 

01:07:20
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

01:07:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) And if you, sometimes you might be right and sometimes you might be wrong just like the beans. 

01:07:30
SAM STEEN Ah… 

01:07:30
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) If this is cherry, if this is red and I saw it tasted like cherry. 

01:07:40
SAM STEEN Hmm…hmm. 

01:07:40
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Right and if I taste this one and I think it is black licorice, I might be wrong. 

01:07:45
SAM STEEN You might be wrong. So you can't make, have you ever heard that word assumptions about people? 

01:07:50
Yeah. 

01:07:50
SAM STEEN You look at them or even go back to earlier when Alex said where she was from or how she described herself as what did she say? 

01:08:00
ROMAN (ph) Umm… what did you say? 

01:08:00
SAM STEEN She said mixed right, and some people may see her and say hmm… I wonder where she is from or what color she is or who her parents from, do you ever get that when people ask? 

01:08:10
She looks like Mexican. 

01:08:10
Or maybe there is a generally people will ask… 

01:08:15
You look like a white, you look like a Mexican. 

01:08:15
SAM STEEN So this is an example you see Alex(ph) and you say she looks Mexican but you didn’t… 

01:08:25
DIADGE (ph) Her skin is black right and is not that dark. 

01:08:25
SAM STEEN Right. So, go ahead. 

01:08:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) May be there is a jelly bean that has more than one flavor. 

01:08:30
SAM STEEN Exactly and so Alex(ph) has multiple flavors, but not only that he saw her and he said may be she looks Mexican, but when… when she described herself, is very different right? So again, we can't make the assumptions about that, thanks for sharing that too by the way. You don’t mind us bringing that up again. Do you? Okay. 

01:08:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I think that you guys really got it, we can't make assumptions about people because we could be wrong. Just like we were wrong sometimes with the jelly beans and sometimes not. 

01:09:05
SAM STEEN You can eat the rest unless you want to… 

01:09:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, if you are brave in what will be the rest. 

01:09:10
SAM STEEN I’m not eating any more. 

01:09:10
SHERI BAUMAN I'm not eating one. 

01:09:15
SAM STEEN Oh! We also have some other goodies for you so, if you. 

01:09:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:09:15
ROMAN (ph) Yeah. 

01:09:15
ALEX (ph) Or too good. 

01:09:20
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so in the same way that we used to… 

01:09:20
SAM STEEN I’ll collect your bag if you are done. 

01:09:20
ALEX (ph) Oh not yet. 

01:09:25
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph) Great taste like boomer(ph). 

01:09:25
DORDGE (ph) I don’t like… 

01:09:30
I don’t want anymore. 

01:09:30
SAM STEEN You want to make sure you get all your flavors (inaudible ) all that. 

01:09:34
hmm…hmm. 

01:09:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:09:35
SAM STEEN Enjoy. 

01:09:35
SHERI BAUMAN So in the same way the jelly beans helped us to think about people and how we do this with people, because you know the first time the very first thing that happens when we see someone just we see what they look like. So that’s the first bit of information we get and I heard Roman(ph) say, I wanna go beyond that first bit of information, because it who it happen to tell me whether they are kind or neat, but it is the first thing we see and sometimes there is people that we may not pay much attention to at all like, I don’t know, umm… maybe homeless people we may not have know them very well. So, we just now know what we see. So, I don’t know about you, but I don’t know very many potatoes very well and I tend to kind of think that potatoes are just the potato. All pretty similar, so what I want you to do is without looking just take one of the, just one step a time just take a potato and pass the bag along. Okay. 

01:10:40
[sil.] 

01:10:45
SAM STEEN You can look at your potato. 

01:10:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right, just… 

01:10:50
SAM STEEN Ha…Ha…Ha. 

01:10:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah once you have it… 

01:10:55
[sil.] 

01:11:05
SAM STEEN Well, I was pleasantly surprised. 

01:11:05
ROMAN (ph) Of what. 

01:11:05
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:11:05
ROMAN (ph) You don’t like it. 

01:11:10
DIADGE (ph) Oh like pulpy. 

01:11:15
SAM STEEN I’ll take the bag anyway. 

01:11:15
ALEX (ph) He want to see them. 

01:11:15
DIADGE (ph) I got a small one. 

01:11:20
ROMAN (ph) I got small one too. 

01:11:20
SHERI BAUMAN So, if we can what I want you to do first is to get acquainted with your potato. Like Roman(ph) said we don’t wanna judge it, you know, just a flap our first impression. So I want you to spent some time and really get to know your individual potato become friends and then while you are doing that, I want you to… 

01:11:40
SAM STEEN But before, before make sure you notice the prompts(ph) and bruises and scars, really get to know it. Yes. 

01:11:55
ILEANA MEIN (ph) I'm going to put them back in the bag and see it. 

01:12:00
SAM STEEN Maybe! 

01:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN We might. 

01:12:00
SAM STEEN Let's see. 

01:12:00
SHERI BAUMAN We just might. 

01:12:00
SAM STEEN So, in addition to giving (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:12:05
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:12:05
SAM STEEN Go ahead Sheri. 

01:12:05
SHERI BAUMAN So, besides looking at it very, very carefully and getting… 

01:12:10
SAM STEEN Someone start… 

01:12:10
SHERI BAUMAN …to know your potato friends, so it's not just any old potato anymore. It’s gonna be a particular potato. I also want you to use your imaginations and make-up a little, like give your potato a name and, and where they come from and what they like to do, and maybe (crosstalk)(inaudible)… 

01:12:30

01:12:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, and where the potato is from? What kind of a cultural background your potato has, okay? 

01:12:55
SAM STEEN And when you’re ready, so think a minute about that, we'll let you share. 

01:13:00
I'm ready. 

01:13:00
I’m ready. 

01:13:00
SAM STEEN I’m not ready and I think… 

01:13:00
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, but I'm not ready. 

01:13:00

01:13:25

01:18:35
Oh, that’s fine. 

01:18:40
SHERI BAUMAN So, do you think that Sam just made up this person or do you have any suspicions about Madeline Claire? What do you think, Daidge? 

01:18:50
SAM STEEN I'm just that creative. 

01:18:50
DAIDGE (ph) He made him up, because he thought it's from Virginia and everything… 

01:18:55
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh…

01:19:20
ROMAN (ph) Can you make us a toy computer? 

01:19:25
SAM STEEN Let me ask Alex(ph) to describe her potato. You can come, we’ll come back to you later, you know. Go ahead Alex(ph).

01:20:30
Dark, very dark. 

01:20:35
SHERI BAUMAN But no, what we took, we thought about forming one but since she lives in Ecuador and I live here, it's gonna be a little trekking. We might have to do something using the internet, yeah. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). I do. I'm sorry? (Crosstalk)(inaudible). That’s a good idea and since she's so small that might not be hard to do. 

01:20:55
You should find it like, like someone who can… 

01:21:00
SHERI BAUMAN That’s true that we (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:21:00
SAM STEEN So, what do we do now? We’ve all described our potato. 

01:21:05
Make faces. 

01:21:10
ALEX (ph) Eat, picking your potato.

SAM STEEN What do you think? Should we put 'em back in the bag? 

01:21:10
Oh, no! 

01:21:10
Yes. 

01:21:10
SHERI BAUMAN And see if (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:21:15
SAM STEEN So, make sure you, you've gotten to know your potato quite well. I'm gonna make sure to figure mine out. 

01:21:20
It's my friend. 

01:21:20
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:21:20
SAM STEEN (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Let's see, if it's your friend you should be able to ah… (Crosstalk)(inaudible). You're lucky.

SHERI BAUMAN Did you cheat? 

01:21:40
SAM STEEN No I didn’t put scars there, I said these are scars that I remember. 

01:21:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh!

SAM STEEN Is it… Ha…ha…ha. 

01:21:50
SHERI BAUMAN Yes, I can tell, you know I'm heartbroken to these things very close friends. 

01:21:55
SAM STEEN Oops sorry. Is anybody worried they won't be able to find their potato? 

01:22:00
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:22:00
I'm gonna miss him. 

01:22:00
SHERI BAUMAN Actually, I was thinking about putting these on the floor. 

01:22:05
Yes. 

01:22:05
SHERI BAUMAN And see if we, and remember that when you first pick this potato up you had met it, before you didn’t know much about it, and now that you’ve gotten acquainted and have a story, we're hoping that… (Crosstalk)(inaudible). …to find your potatoes. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:22:25
My potato! 

01:22:25
My potato. 

01:22:30
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:22:35
That one's mine. 

01:22:35
SAM STEEN No, I think that’s mine. That yours. 

01:22:40
Yeah. 

01:22:40
Yours is this one. 

01:22:40
SAM STEEN It's mine. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). The one Daidge has. Daidge has my potato. 

01:22:45
Oh, I got it. 

01:22:45

01:22:50
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:22:50
SAM STEEN Oh, my Madeline Claire, I found you. 

01:22:55

01:23:00
SAM STEEN Yeah, you gotta be sure? 

01:23:05
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:23:10
SAM STEEN Too bad there is more than we had (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:23:10
Your potato? 

01:23:15
SAM STEEN Dordge(ph) did you get yours? 

01:23:15
DORDGE (ph) Dotty! 

01:23:15
SAM STEEN Oh! 

01:23:15
DORDGE (ph) Dotty, Dotty, that's a doughnut. 

01:23:15
SAM STEEN What's the name of your potato friend again, Roman(ph)? Where is Roman(ph)? 

01:23:20
I don't know. 

01:23:20
SAM STEEN You waited (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:23:25
There is Roman(ph) 

01:23:25
SAM STEEN No your potato friend. 

01:23:25
Your potato Roman(ph) 

01:23:30
DORDGE (ph) Oh, Dotty, you're okay. 

01:23:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:23:35
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:23:35
SAM STEEN Well let me ask you a question while Daidge(ph) is still picking up their potatoes or their friends I should say. No, no, no. I'm… I was gonna wait, are you… 

01:23:50
DAIDGE (ph) So looking to (inaudible ). 

01:23:56
Don't care. 

01:23:56
SAM STEEN So what do you think? When we first started, when we first started… 

01:24:00
DAIDGE (ph) I got you. 

01:24:00
SAM STEEN …did you. Did you find? Okay. 

01:24:05
ROMAN (ph) Ha…ha…ha. 

01:24:05
SAM STEEN When we first started did you think that will be easy? 

01:24:10
ROMAN (ph) No, yeah. 

01:24:10
SAM STEEN Which part, to find out your friend or to… 

01:24:10
ROMAN (ph) To find your friends, yeah. 

01:24:15
SAM STEEN Do you think that was easy? (Crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:24:15
That one. 

01:24:15
ROMAN (ph) And I was just got like a… 

01:24:20
SAM STEEN Oh, so… But before when you first picked up the potato, did you know all those things about it? 

01:24:25
ROMAN (ph) No. 

01:24:25
SAM STEEN No. So, you took your little while to find out the scars? 

01:24:25
ILEANA MEIN It was easy for me to find mine, this has four ah, holes like (inaudible ). 

01:24:36
SAM STEEN Ah…Ah… 

01:24:36
ILEANA MEIN (ph) And it kinda makes it into like a diamond shapes. 

01:24:40
SAM STEEN So the more you paid attention to your potato, the more you were able to pick out very specific details it looks like. Is that right? Wow! Alex(ph) and then Oligue. 

01:24:50
ALEX (ph) Mine is easy to find because it has these two scars right here. 

01:24:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… So there were some unique characteristics about it. Is that right? 

01:24:55
ALEX (ph) Yes 

01:24:55
SAM STEEN Oligue! 

01:24:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)Ah… I… I knew this was Dotty Dot, because, because the front is not as dark as the back. 

01:25:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:25:05
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)And it has dots on the front. 

01:25:10
SAM STEEN So, even you could tell about the complexion of your potato? Is that what you're saying, it's not as dark on the front as it is on the back. Daidge(ph)! 

01:25:15
DAIDGE (ph) Mine was hard because this one and this one look alike, and all of them are brown. 

01:25:20
SAM STEEN So, they're all the same color but and, and those two in particular look similar, but how did you then decide which one was yours? 

01:25:30
DAIDGE (ph) The dots and dents. 

01:25:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:25:35
ROMAN (ph) I soon realized ah, that this is my potato, because it also has two scars next to each other. 

01:25:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:25:40
ROMAN (ph) On the side, you know they have like a (crosstalk)(inaudible). Yeah! 

01:25:45
SAM STEEN So, some very specific scratches. Now again, if we were to relate this to people, we know they are people, but you all did come up with some creative stories about your potato. What do you think? 

01:26:00
SHERI BAUMAN Because you kind of, you've gotten the idea that even when we're talking about beans and potatoes, we're really talking about people. What the lesson and this we're like the moral of the story? What could we… What does it teach us about people, Ileana? 

01:26:10
ILEANA MEIN Like we (inaudible ) people look like. 

01:26:16
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:26:16
SHERI BAUMAN So that's, that's something that we could focus on but what else? 

01:26:20
SAM STEEN Right, when you first saw it, you can't just make the assumption about that? 

01:26:20
SHERI BAUMAN Hmm…Hmm… What happened as you got to know your potato. Roman(ph) 

01:26:30
ROMAN (ph) That it was nice. 

01:26:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:26:30
SHERI BAUMAN And Daidge(ph), I don't know if anybody heard you. 

01:26:35
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… 

01:26:35
SHERI BAUMAN What did you, you just said, you said… 

01:26:40
DAIDGE (ph) Oh, we got closer, ah… Yeah! 

01:26:40
SAM STEEN You built the relationship, it sounds like. 

01:26:45
DAIDGE (ph) No, this one's good. 

01:26:45
SAM STEEN It's what? 

01:26:50
DAIDGE (ph) It's a boy. 

01:26:50
SAM STEEN Oh no, not relationship like boyfriend, girlfriend, is that we you thought I meant? 

01:26:55
DAIDGE (ph) Yes. 

01:26:55
SAM STEEN Okay. 

01:26:55
ALEX (ph) He bonded. 

01:27:00
SAM STEEN You're bonded, yeah. 

01:27:00
SHERI BAUMAN So, the more you got to know somebody, the closer you became and the more we discovered beneath the skin, Ileana(ph) . 

01:27:10
ILEANA MEIN I meant some of his friends. 

01:27:10
SHERI BAUMAN Ah! That's a great point, that once you got to know one person it kind of added to your social room. Great, great observation. Roman(ph)! 

01:27:20
ROMAN (ph) We had a couple of sleep fallers. 

01:27:20
SHERI BAUMAN Oh! 

01:27:25
SAM STEEN So he did some activities. Dordge(ph) what are you thinking? 

01:27:25
DORDGE (ph) I don't know. I don't know. 

01:27:30
SAM STEEN I mean, not sure? Hmm…Hmm… Oligue! 

01:27:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)We've met with each other. We met with each other. 

01:27:35
SAM STEEN So you guys got to know each other once you begin to live together? Is that right Dotty Dot? 

01:27:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:27:45
SAM STEEN Okay. We have one more activity we like to do, is that right? 

01:27:45
SHERI BAUMAN Again keeping in mind that the ideas that as we get to know people the immediate things that we learn about them become less important because we know more details. 

01:28:00
SAM STEEN I see some people trying to put their potatoes in their pocket. 

01:28:00
SHERI BAUMAN I know. 

01:28:05
SAM STEEN You can have. Now, you wanna leave them on the floor or should we put them back in the bag. 

01:28:05
No! 

01:28:05
Bag. 

01:28:05
I mean, no. 

01:28:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, well you're willing to part with your potato, you can put it in the bag and if you are not (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:28:15
SAM STEEN But you… You do… You do need both of (crosstalk)(inaudible). You need both… You can get it later. 

01:28:20
SHERI BAUMAN Anybody who would like to deposit their potato can do that. 

01:28:25
I gonna put my potato in the bag. 

01:28:25
SAM STEEN And you can get it later. I'm gonna keep mine too. 

01:28:30
I've deposited mine. 

01:28:35
SAM STEEN But Dotty Dot needs to take a nap, don't you think? 

01:28:35
Yes. 

01:28:40
He's been all tired today. 

01:28:40
SHERI BAUMAN That's right. 

01:28:40
SAM STEEN Okay. We have one more activity we like to do. Does anybody like candy? 

01:28:45
Me. 

01:28:45
SHERI BAUMAN Oh no, I could tell none of these likes that, no. 

01:28:50
SAM STEEN They don't want candy, I will put it away. 

01:28:50
No… No… No… 

01:28:50
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:28:55
SAM STEEN Okay, here's what you gotta do, just take a handful of candy, but you can't it yet, okay. And don't look, just take a, a scoop of M&M's, hold it in your hands, and churn out the cover because what had happened. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). It will melt, it kind of… 

01:29:10
SHERI BAUMAN And we wanna make sure there is enough for everybody, so take some. 

01:29:10
SAM STEEN Right. Just take some and then pass it this way, okay. And make sure you can hold them. 

01:29:20
SHERI BAUMAN I just saw a good idea (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:29:20
SAM STEEN Just make sure everybody has enough. 

01:29:30
Cloud one. 

01:29:30
SAM STEEN You can wait. Just give us a second. Ha…ha…ha. 

01:29:35
SHERI BAUMAN (inaudible ), look at this. 

01:29:36
I know, really. 

01:29:36
SAM STEEN There is enough. 

01:29:36
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:29:36
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:29:40
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, it looks like they're explaining just we couldn't see 'em. 

01:29:40
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:29:45
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:29:55
ALEX (ph) I bet your potato was sleeping. 

01:29:55
SAM STEEN There is one more. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Okay! Does everyone have some M&M's, okay. So, you have… This is a… This is a… Ah… You have to listen very closely. Take a look at the yellow ones and try to do, I guess the first thing is try to separate them into different colors. Maybe hard on your shirts, but you can try. Especially if you took too many. But the first thing is try to group them into different colors. Can you do that? 

01:30:30
No. 

01:30:30
SAM STEEN And if you have too many, maybe put some to the side and then, you can still eat them later. Those are easier for me. 

01:30:45
That's because you have a big hand. 

01:30:45
SAM STEEN I have a big hand. 

01:30:45
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:30:45
SAM STEEN I have a big hand and not that meaning M&M's you that. 

01:30:55

SHERI BAUMAN Thank you. 

01:31:25
I want to eat them now. 

01:31:30
Ha…ha…ha. Okay, you're still working on that? 

01:31:30

01:31:50
SAM STEEN You did a good job, very good. 

01:31:50

01:31:55

01:32:05
DAIDGE (ph) I got five. 

01:32:05
SAM STEEN Maybe they took too many. 

01:32:10
I think so. 

01:32:10
ALEX (ph) I did it. 

01:32:10
It will take too many… (Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:32:10
SAM STEEN But you still want to eat them. 

01:32:15
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:32:15
ALEX (ph) Yes. 

01:32:20
ROMAN (ph) Well it's a good idea. 

01:32:20
SAM STEEN What? 

01:32:20
ROMAN (ph) To put on your lap. 

01:32:20
If there is too many (crosstalk)(inaudible) and you don't know. 

01:32:25
SAM STEEN You can't move around. Hmm…Hmm… 

01:32:25
Yeah, we're trying to make it crunched. 

01:32:30
SHERI BAUMAN Well wait until, wait and see, because I'm sure you can guess that we have some strategy planned here. 

01:32:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)Which one is mine (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:32:40
Oh, yes you just (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:32:40
SAM STEEN I… I wonder if you're wondering how they taste, do you think they taste different? (Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:32:45
ALEX (ph) They all taste the same. 

01:32:45
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:32:50
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)They will taste the same. 

01:32:50
SHERI BAUMAN So, you trust us, you don't think we do the same thing twice. 

01:32:50
They don't have… 

01:32:55
DORDGE (ph) So (crosstalk)(inaudible) jelly based… 

01:32:55
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)They don't have, they don't have the same (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:32:55
SHERI BAUMAN Ah… No we didn't do it, (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:33:00
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)Well, can I eat this little piece. 

01:33:00
SAM STEEN I am not gonna answer. 

01:33:05
DORDGE (ph) Don't do that. 

01:33:05
SAM STEEN Okay, did everyone pretty much having kind of… 

01:33:05
SHERI BAUMAN Kind of yes. 

01:33:05
SAM STEEN …it looks like, everyone stuck, maybe… 

01:33:10
SHERI BAUMAN That's enough. 

01:33:10
SAM STEEN …so the first thing, just take a look and you are to look at your yellow ones and based on how many yellow ones you have, count, count it up, count how many yellow ones you have, I have two. 

01:33:20
Eight. 

01:33:25
I've 13.

SAM STEEN You're… Ha…ha…ha. 

01:33:30

01:33:30
SAM STEEN So you are to think about… 

01:33:35
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)Eight and two. 

01:33:35
SAM STEEN …we want you to think about for you, you said 13. 

01:33:35
DORDGE (ph) I have 13. 

01:33:40
ALEX (ph) I have 7. 

01:33:40
I have (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:33:40
SAM STEEN 13? 

01:33:40
DORDGE (ph) I have 13. 

01:33:40
ALEX (ph) I have 7. 

01:33:40
SAM STEEN You have 19? How many? 

01:33:45
ILEANA MEIN (ph) 19. 

01:33:45
SAM STEEN Ileana(ph) has 19, so Ileana(ph) has to come on with 19 things that she is proud of. 

01:33:50
Oh! Ha…ha…ha. 

01:33:50
SAM STEEN Can you imagine that… 

01:33:50
ALEX (ph) Yeah, and… 

01:33:55
…she can do it. 

01:33:55
Ah… 

01:33:55
SAM STEEN And then if you have 7, how many do you have? 

01:34:00
DORDGE (ph) 13. 

01:34:00
SAM STEEN You have to come up with 13, how many 13. 

01:34:00
ROMAN (ph) Eight. 

01:34:00
SAM STEEN Eight, I have two. 

01:34:00
ALEX (ph) Seven. 

01:34:05
SAM STEEN Seven. 

01:34:05
SHERI BAUMAN Now, how is it that you only have two, I want to know. 

01:34:05
SAM STEEN Well, it's because I knew the game so I just took a small handful. 

01:34:10
Oh, oh… 

01:34:10
SHERI BAUMAN That's not fair. 

01:34:15
SAM STEEN Well, if you like to know we could do to make it a little easier. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). Yeah, it sounds like we maybe have too many, so you can put some to the side, because they're still yours. 

01:34:25
ROMAN (ph) I have an idea, I have an idea, why don't each person can give one yellow M&M to Sam so he has more. 

01:34:30
SAM STEEN No. 

01:34:30
ALEX (ph) Yeah, yeah. 

01:34:30
Yes. 

01:34:30
ALEX (ph) Yes. 

01:34:30
SAM STEEN Because, that means that I'll be eating yellow M&M's from your grubby hands and I don't want that. 

01:34:35
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:34:40
We do fine, we do fine. 

01:34:40
I have too much oranges. 

01:34:40
ALEX (ph) I'll lend it to you. 

01:34:40
SAM STEEN How about this, I got an idea. Don't take a look, but take out 10 M&M's. 

01:34:45
ROMAN (ph) What. 

01:34:45
SHERI BAUMAN Any ten. 

01:34:45
SAM STEEN Just any ten, not the same color, just take ten. So mix them backup with me. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). You gotta mix them backup. 

01:34:50
ALEX (ph) Oh my god. 

01:34:55
SAM STEEN Mix them all of again. 

01:34:55
Ah! 

01:34:55
Ha…ha…ha. 

01:34:55
SAM STEEN You can put the rest in maybe your (crosstalk)(inaudible). You got to, Oligue put them in your snack bag. No put them in your snack bag. 

01:35:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:35:05
SAM STEEN So this time only make sure you have only ten. 

01:35:10
DORDGE (ph) So we can put this in here. 

01:35:10
SAM STEEN Put them in your snack bag. 

01:35:10
SHERI BAUMAN The extras yeah, besides your ten. 

01:35:15
DORDGE (ph) Oh! 

01:35:15
SHERI BAUMAN Keep, keep out ten. 

01:35:20
There is so much M&M's. 

01:35:20
So keep ten out. 

01:35:20
SAM STEEN Yeah keep out ten and because you, you can still eat them, but they go in your snack bag. Do you have your bag Ileana? 

01:35:25
Oh, god still I have… 

01:35:25
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. We got some logistical chance. 

01:35:30
SAM STEEN Not the same color, but take different ones. 

01:35:30
SHERI BAUMAN M&M's crisis. 

01:35:35
I took two out each color. 

01:35:35
SAM STEEN I'm glad you all figured out a way to do this. (Crosstalk)(inaudible). So, Ileana(ph) mix all yours up and just keep ten. 

01:35:45
DORDGE (ph) So I put all the color back. 

01:35:45
SAM STEEN Yeah, but you'd get to eat them later. 

01:35:50
ALEX (ph) Wait, you could… 

01:35:50
SAM STEEN All of them back except for ten. 

01:35:50
One, two, okay, three…

01:43:35
SAM STEEN Green, this is the tough one. 

01:43:40
SHERI BAUMAN Ah, green, get to start. Yeah. 

01:43:40
SAM STEEN Something someone wouldn't know about you. 

01:43:45
What, 

01:43:45
Oh, well. 

01:43:45
SAM STEEN You have to come up with something… 

01:43:45
SHERI BAUMAN That they might not know just by looking… 

01:43:50
SAM STEEN …about you. 

01:43:50
SHERI BAUMAN …that you think nobody in here might… No. 

01:43:50
SAM STEEN Nobody knows about it. 

01:43:50
DAIDGE (ph) Ah… 

01:43:50
SAM STEEN Hmm… That's a tough one. Whoever is ready can go first, yeah. 

01:44:00
Umm… 

01:44:00
SAM STEEN Umm… 

01:44:00
SHERI BAUMAN That's a good point. I am, I am gonna interrupt for a second, just Dordge(ph) to add up something that might be an, another good norm for us to have. Sometimes, something might come to your mind and it's too personal, so you can only say, I want to pass on that one. 

01:44:15
SAM STEEN Hmm… 

01:44:15
SHERI BAUMAN So nobody is gonna be forced to, to say something that you don't want to say. We hope you'll feel comfortable, but you always have that choice. 

01:44:25
DAIDGE (ph) I want to pass. 

01:44:25
SAM STEEN Do you want to pass. 

01:44:25
DAIDGE (ph) Pass. 

01:44:25
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, oh, oh, maybe that wasn't such a good, no it has to be, not because it's hard. 

01:44:30
SAM STEEN Is it because it's some, it's something that we wouldn't know about you, because that you're scared to share or it is that… 

01:44:35
DAIDGE (ph) Somebody won't know that I am like to run (inaudible ). 

01:44:41
SAM STEEN Right, that's okay. Yeah, that's a good one.

SAM STEEN And that's what I was gonna say. 

01:50:20
(Crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:50:20
DAIDGE (ph) I know. 

01:50:20
SAM STEEN It's okay. I was gonna say I have an older brother and I have a younger sister. So, we took a lot of time to do that, but I hope you enjoyed the M&M's. 

01:50:30
ALEX (ph) Yeah. 

01:50:30
SAM STEEN Oh, yeah. 

01:50:30
SHERI BAUMAN We enjoyed learning some things about each other. 

01:50:35
SAM STEEN About each other. Uh…Huh… 

01:50:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, if someone, ah, willing to share something that surprised them or that they learned, not just from this last activity, but in today's session. 

01:50:45
OLIGUE CZARSKI (ph)Oh, ah, pass. 

01:50:50
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, back to you. 

01:50:50
SAM STEEN Well, we took a lot of time to get to know you alright, by allowing you to share things about yourself and Roman(ph) you were gonna say. 

01:51:00
ROMAN (ph) Ah, I have one question for you (inaudible ) that we might have a different thoughts. 

01:51:05
SHERI BAUMAN Sure, let's do that. Let's see if anybody ah, wants to share anything, that's a good idea. 

01:51:10
SAM STEEN Ileana(ph) you had your hand up. 

01:51:10
ILEANA MEIN I want you to say what you said (inaudible ). 

01:51:16
SAM STEEN So we talk about things that we haven't talked about it first. Ah… 

01:51:20
SHERI BAUMAN In turns out we only have a couple of minutes… 

01:51:20
SAM STEEN Minutes left. 

01:51:20
SHERI BAUMAN …before that we have to stop… 

01:51:25
SAM STEEN Okay. 

01:51:25
SHERI BAUMAN …and since we had a request to do the circle. 

01:51:25
SAM STEEN We could do it at the beginning of the next session. 

01:51:30
SHERI BAUMAN Will that be a (inaudible ) or it was your idea, how about that, if we start with the next session. Okay, great. 

01:51:35
SAM STEEN Ah… 

01:51:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, let's think about what surprised you or what is interesting to learn about each other. 

01:51:40
SAM STEEN And we will see you in a week. So make sure you complete your evaluations. There's that a form you filled out last time, complete that again for us. 

01:51:45
See you. 

01:51:45
Bye. 

01:51:45
SAM STEEN Okay thank you, see you the next time. 

01:51:50
See you… 

01:51:50
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. Bye Dotty Dot. 

01:51:55
Discussion 

01:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yikes. 

01:52:05
SAM STEEN So, so what you think… 

01:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:52:05
SAM STEEN Ha…ha…ha. Why you said yikes? What do you mean? 

01:52:10
SHERI BAUMAN Well I think, that was little bit of a three ring circus. 

01:52:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:52:10
SHERI BAUMAN That may be these activities one after another were a bit… 

01:52:15
SAM STEEN Lengthy. 

01:52:15
SHERI BAUMAN Not just lengthy, but they were all, the, the same message. 

01:52:20
SAM STEEN The same message. 

01:52:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:52:20
SAM STEEN Ah… 

01:52:20
SHERI BAUMAN And that maybe that overdid it. So, that was one observation. What about you, what did you, what were your responses? 

01:52:25
SAM STEEN It seem like this session, I know that it's the second one, but it seem, longer even than 45 minutes. It seemed kind of long. Ah… No one really seemed bored. They still were engaged and participative, but it was a bit long and I don't know, I'm just, I've mixed feelings about it. 

01:52:45
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. I still think, all of them seemed to be participating and engaged. 

01:52:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:52:55
SHERI BAUMAN I felt a little bit, I hoped that, that, that interjection of their right to pass… 

01:53:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:53:00
SHERI BAUMAN …it went on of course they were all gonna pass. 

01:53:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:53:00
SHERI BAUMAN But I just felt as though, because I overheard something or, you know, I don't remember exactly what Dordge(ph) said but… 

01:53:10
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… That would lead you to believe that maybe that will be a, a good. 

01:53:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:53:15
SAM STEEN Actually, it, even though, they kind of adopted a pass, pass, pass and I think it's helpful for the future sessions. Because some of the material we discussed maybe a little bit more ah, uncomfortable? 

01:53:25
SHERI BAUMAN And the truth is after they did the pass, pass, pass, they all shared… 

01:53:30
SAM STEEN It was okay. 

01:53:30
So maybe they were testing that. 

01:53:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… That's true. But to have it for future reference might not be a bad idea. 

01:53:35
SHERI BAUMAN So, is there anybody in the group you are concerned about? That we… 

01:53:40
SAM STEEN No you checked in Dordge(ph), she seemed tired, which is understandable. 

01:53:45
SHERI BAUMAN Right. I did notice that sometimes, Daidge(ph) physically… 

01:53:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:53:50
SHERI BAUMAN …separates himself. They seemed to have all tolerate his, his need to move… 

01:54:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:54:00
SHERI BAUMAN …so, maybe that's something they know about him that we don't know. So, I don't think that's an issue. 

01:54:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… And, and, and it didn't look like it bothered them when he did things that were unique to his personality like sitting, sitting on the floor and actually taking his time. It didn't seem like, I mean people were gracious in that way. 

01:54:15
SHERI BAUMAN Which is what we're hoping to get anyway… 

01:54:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:54:15
SHERI BAUMAN …that we need to be respectful of differences, so, yeah, I think that's great. What about you and I? 

01:54:20
SAM STEEN What do you mean? 

01:54:25
SHERI BAUMAN How do you think we've worked together this session? 

01:54:25
SAM STEEN I think fine. I think similar to the first session, but I think we both recognized along the way, sort of, ah, the cumbersome attached to the activities. Sometimes, they can get in the way. But at the same time, ah, you, with youngsters you have to have something in place to kinda generate these discussions, and so as far as us co-leading together, I think it's, I don't, I don't really have any feelings in terms of negative feeling about that at all, it seemed as I had anticipated. 

01:55:00
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so you don't need any more or different kind of response from me. 

01:55:00
SAM STEEN No. What about you? 

01:55:05
SHERI BAUMAN Umm… Maybe I felt as though I wasn't as helpful as I could have been. 

01:55:10
SAM STEEN In the sessions. 

01:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN Uh…Huh… 

01:55:10
SAM STEEN I don't think… 

01:55:10
SHERI BAUMAN No, not the first one, this one. 

01:55:15
SAM STEEN That's what I mean, in this session. No, I, I saw it as the same. Oh, you mean like, that you feel like I was leading the whole session. 

01:55:20
SHERI BAUMAN No… 

01:55:20
SAM STEEN Umm… 

01:55:20
SHERI BAUMAN I just wasn't sure that I interjected as much as you wanted me to, so if that's not an issue then we're good to go. 

01:55:30
SAM STEEN Oh, not at all. No, and we had already again decided, you know, I wouldn't do the first when you do the second one, which was more lengthy and I try to do the third one which actually, that brings up a good point, you noticed how we shifted on the activity. The kids kind of generated it. But I think you and I were feeling that way. 

01:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN Ha…ha…ha. 

01:55:45
SAM STEEN They took this like handful, and we said (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN (Crosstalk)(inaudible) three months and they'll be sick from all (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:55:50
SAM STEEN Yeah they do 16, that you're proud about it and you know, they're like, what maybe I should put some back. So, again they were very gracious in adopting to that sort of or being flexible with that. 

01:56:00
SHERI BAUMAN Right if we had more to tell, it would be interesting to have more time with these kids and, and… 

01:56:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:56:05
SHERI BAUMAN …help them recognize more of their strengths… 

01:56:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:56:05
SHERI BAUMAN …but we'll get there. 

01:56:10
SAM STEEN We will and also Rolin… Roman(ph), to be able to bring back the comfort level things was interesting that he actually initiated that as well. 

01:56:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, yeah, so we've gotta do that obviously. 

01:56:20
SAM STEEN How are… How are they in terms of talking to each other? 

01:56:20
SHERI BAUMAN I think they need ah, a little help, but I wonder if it would be you know, you, you did it, early on in the first session… 

01:56:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:56:30
SHERI BAUMAN …can you tell her. 

01:56:30
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:56:35
SHERI BAUMAN And, we'd have to model it and teach it, and, and… 

01:56:35
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:56:35
SHERI BAUMAN …which given the focus and the limitations of this group. What do you think, do we wanna take out some time and do that when we speak to someone's directly. 

01:56:50
SAM STEEN I don't… Maybe we don't need to necessarily make a concerted effort at saying structuring this, but we can just ask, would you consider saying it directly to, if it's something like the compliment. 

01:57:00
SHERI BAUMAN And you know what, let's make sure ah, to model that. 

01:57:05
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:57:05
SHERI BAUMAN That it always helps to being… Because we're gonna do compliments at the end of this session I think. 

01:57:05
SAM STEEN I think so. 

01:57:05
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:57:05
SAM STEEN What we may need to… 

01:57:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. 

01:57:10
SAM STEEN …and what are your thoughts about the, the upcoming session? 

01:57:10
SHERI BAUMAN I'm just trying to remember it. 

01:57:15
SAM STEEN I think it's the one where we, it's pretty heavy in terms of expressing things that they've been ah, that caused them to feel sad or… 

01:57:25
SHERI BAUMAN Oh, that, is this the heads? 

01:57:25
SAM STEEN Yeah the ah, Styrofoam balls. 

01:57:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay. 

01:57:25
SAM STEEN And… (Crosstalk)(inaudible) Have they ever been hurt? 

01:57:30
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, are they ready for that, do we wanna move that? What do you think? 

01:57:35
SAM STEEN I think that it's based on some of the comments they share ah, that they have disclosed about maybe they're being in a house or losing a loved one, means that they're pretty comfortable and it would have been interesting to see, where Roman(ph) put's himself in others own the comfort level ah, circle so we could kinda decide at the beginning of the next session. 

01:57:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, good idea. 

01:57:55
SAM STEEN If they're still in the middle and they're not very comfortable then we might wanna go to something else. But if they are… (Crosstalk)(inaudible)…then we just move forward. 

01:58:05
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, here is the other thing. I think that my initial explanation of comfort zone… 

01:58:15
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:58:15
SHERI BAUMAN …was okay, but I think they're confused between what's the ideal state, do you want to be in the middle and completely comfortable without taking risks or are you safe to take risk. So, maybe we wanna get them to decide, since they brought this up… 

01:58:30
SAM STEEN I like that. 

01:58:30
SHERI BAUMAN …what those spots represent. 

01:58:35
SAM STEEN I would agree with that. 

01:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN And then… 

01:58:35
SAM STEEN So, when we bring it out maybe to say, where are you now and then when they put it, let's say well… 

01:58:40
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, what does that mean? 

01:58:40
SAM STEEN …what does that mean? 

01:58:40
SHERI BAUMAN Instead of just up to space, because I think it was that several different people have different impressions of what that is? 

01:58:45
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:58:45
SHERI BAUMAN With schools that they're ah, willing to contribute their own ideas… 

01:58:50
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… 

01:58:50
SHERI BAUMAN …and they suggested let's do this, or let's do it that way. 

01:58:55
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:58:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I… Ah… It's… It always cracks me up they insist on raising their hands. 

01:59:00
SAM STEEN Yeah. 

01:59:00
SHERI BAUMAN But if we can do having them pick and… 

01:59:00
SAM STEEN Uh…Huh… Uh…Huh… 

01:59:00
SHERI BAUMAN …all that, but the… the other thing is that we all got their hands up, so… 

01:59:05
SAM STEEN Yes, sure. 

01:59:05
SHERI BAUMAN …that's pretty neat. 

01:59:05
SAM STEEN And as far as behavior and discipline? 

01:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN I think it, I think it's… 

01:59:10
SAM STEEN We've kept them on track and they've been actively participating, so. 

01:59:15
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah. Okay are you ready for that next one. 

01:59:15
SAM STEEN Let's see what happens. 

01:59:15
