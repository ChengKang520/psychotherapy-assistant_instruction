LAWRENCE CURRY On January 21st, 1995, 14-year-old Tony Hicks shot and killed Tariq Khamisa, a 20-year-old college student who was delivering pizzas in San Diego, California. The consequences of this one tragic act of violence would devastate, and unexpected. 

00:00:35
Ending the Cycle of Violence Actions have consequences 

00:00:50
LAWRENCE CURRY When Tony Hicks shot and killed Tariq Khamisa, the action of pulling the trigger took an instant. 

00:00:55
The Consequences 

00:00:55
LAWRENCE CURRY But the consequences continued for years. 

00:01:00
TONY HICKS The immediate consequence umm… through a loss of life, creation and loss another unique individual. Azim lost is son, Hamaz lost is son, Tasreen lost her brother. 

00:01:20
TASREEN KHAMISA ALAEI Tariq’s Sister My parents have to go identifying my brother’s body, and now that I have my own son, now, I… I just can’t imagine how that must have been for them to have to go and see their son. You know lying in a cold table and have to identify him. 

00:01:35
AZIM KHAMISA Tariq’s Father It’s the most excruciating pain that one ever encounters. I equated to having a bomb go off in my heart. 

00:01:45
ALMAS KHAMISA , Tariq’s Mother And then of course the anger set in when I realized that, he had been killed over a pizza was ah… another child, a 14-year-old killing him. I think that’s when it became so senseless. 

00:02:05
TASREEN KHAMISA ALAEI You go through all that. You know you think back and you want, wish you could change things and of course I wish, God if he just given up the pizza may be he would have been here today. 

00:02:15
LAWRENCE CURRY The consequences of Tariq’s death were very hard on his fiancée Jennifer. Soon after the shooting, she left San Diego. Five years later, she wrote Tariq’s father Azim a letter. 

00:02:30
AZIM KHAMISA I have been dwelling in my pain since I left San Diego and have not founded within myself to return until fairly recently. I found a way to escape from all that had happened through an addiction to heroine. It’s a three-page letter, took a lot of courage, I think for her write it. Six months later, she committed suicide. 

00:02:55
TASREEN KHAMISA ALAEI She went down that road of not letting go and having those feelings and not letting those feelings go, and holding onto that. And I think ultimately, she couldn’t just be in this world anymore. She had a really hard time being without my brother. 

00:03:15
LAWRENCE CURRY Tony’s actions had a shattering impact on his family as well. 

00:03:20
TONY HICKS My mother lost her son and my grandfather lost his… his grandson. 

00:03:25
PLES FELIX Tony’s Grandfather & Guardian That feeling for boarding came on me. First thing I did was to call my daughter. 

00:03:30
As well his mother’s eyes filled with tears. Today… 

00:03:35
PLES FELIX And then she asked me; "Do you believe Tony killed somebody?" I said; "I don’t wanna believe it." 

00:03:45
You're admitting sir that on that day, you did in fact shoot and kill Mr. Khamisa during the attempted commission of a robbery, is that correct? 

00:03:50
TONY HICKS Yeah. 

00:03:55
PLES FELIX I guess I want him to not accept that is reality. And I knew the life would change forever, for the family members and then the Tony's life changed.

00:04:30

TONY HICKS My days were short, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Everyday is on a schedule. I clean my cell, I work out and I read. 

00:05:40
LAWRENCE CURRY The path that led to the moment that Tony pulled the trigger started long before he encountered Tariq. 

00:05:45
Tony’s Childhood 

00:05:45
TONY HICKS At time I was born till I was nine, I was with my mother, moving around the (inaudible ) from the nine. My mother shipped out to with my grandfather.

00:07:15
Ditching School 

00:07:15
TONY HICKS And I started not going to school. I started lacks into my studies. I just started hanging out a lot more. 

00:07:20
Doing Drugs 

00:07:20
TONY HICKS When I finally got to ninth grade, I was… I was pretty much smoking a pipe. Before I went to school or like on the way to school, I smoke my day away basically. 

00:07:35
Getting in Trouble 

00:07:35
TONY HICKS I had covert, the marijuana and I, lot of cigarette, marijuana cigarettes at school well, off school campus on my way home. All these days it was, he didn’t tell me. Ah… I cannot point fingers at anyone, to any one person. But, the only thing is kind of weight heavy on me. And without me being able to ah… to express them in any one or to really call within myself umm… they just spilled out. 

00:08:05
LAWRENCE CURRY Tony was 14 years old, angry and depressed when it all spilled out on Saturday, January 21, 1995. 

00:08:15
Saturday January 21, 1995 

00:08:15
TONY HICKS It was a Saturday and I wanted to go outside, umm… drank my sorrows or whatever. And I can't go anywhere, that is made my mind that I was going away, no one coming back. 

00:08:35
Planning the Robbery 

00:08:35
TONY HICKS Now all unfolded, he was all hanging out at another guys house. I guy just made drinking and smoking pipe. Yeah, I don’t really recall who exactly decided that we should order a pizza boy, he was all in agreeing… in agreement on it that we order a pizza and not pay the guy. 

00:08:55
The Robbery 

00:08:55
TONY HICKS Everybody was behind me while I asked him for the pizza. And he already put the pizza in the trunk and ah… and he was backing away. It was like one time basically. It was just… It was… It was me and him and him backing up. When he… Once he got in the car, he began to roll up the window of his car. Then I shot him. I shot him through the window. 

00:09:25
Tariq’s Family’s Surprising Response 

00:09:25
LAWRENCE CURRY In the midst of the pain, the grief, the anger, the broken hearts and wasted life, Tariq’s family decided to make a stand and do something to end the cycle of violence. First, they reached out Tony Hicks and his family with compassionate forgiveness. 

00:09:40
Tony Hicks' Sentencing Statement June 18, 1996 

00:09:45
TONY HICKS A person I didn't even know and who didn't do anything wrong to me. My grandfather and Mr. Reynolds have tried to explain to me the compassion that Khamisa family has for me. 

00:09:50
10 CONTINUING COVERAGE 

00:09:55
LAWRENCE CURRY Together were Tony’s grandfather Ples, Tariq’s father Azim started a foundation to help other kids avoid the negative consequences of violence by choosing positive actions. 

00:10:10
Positive Consequences 

00:10:10
TONY HICKS Some of the good things I guess are coming, that's come out of all this is Tariq Khamisa Foundation and it is my grandfather and others being able to speak to kids and talk to them about the actions and (inaudible ) violence and how to make right decisions and actions do have consequences. 

00:10:35
ALMAS KHAMISA Each one of you can make a different choice… 

00:10:40
LAWRENCE CURRY Tariq’s family’s decision to respond to the murder of their son with nonviolent action was a positive choice. But it wasn’t an easy one. 

00:10:45
Violence Impact Forum Monroe Clark Middle School San Diego, CA 

00:10:50
AZIM KHAMISA And I know that many students want to know how I felt when I got the call from the police, to tell me that my only son Tariq had been shot and killed. You might imagine how you would feel if a bomb went off in your body. That is very-very painful, and you're broken into millions of small pieces. My life as I knew it totally changed when Tariq passed away. So I want you to know that while you see violence, remember that out of every violent situation there is deep pain that really comes out of violent acts. What would you do if your brother or your sister was murdered? What would do? Many, many students tell me that they would want revenge. How many here would want revenge? Let’s see. Now, I want to acknowledge that, because it’s natural, to want revenge, to be angry. But the thing that I want impress on you is this one thing to feel anger and one thing to feel revenge, but we must not act it out. Those are different things. Feelings and actions are separate things. It's very important to acknowledge your feelings, but you must be able to do something more positive with those negative feelings. 

00:12:25
THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE 

00:12:25
AZIM KHAMISA If you choose to meet violence with more violence, then we continue this cycle. We continue the cycle of pain and grief and if you continuously do this thing then this pain and grief we all feel will never go away. 

00:12:40
TONY HICKS …especially when I'm alone, myself… 

00:12:45
AZIM KHAMISA So we must learn, that we must find other ways, other nonviolent ways to meet violence, as I was able to do. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
AZIM KHAMISA This path worked for me and my family, my daughter and Tariq’s mother, and the realities because of this choice. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
LAWRENCE CURRY Whether we are choosing positive actions as Tariq’s family did. 

00:13:20
AZIM KHAMISA Hi. 

00:13:25
Hi. 

00:13:25
AZIM KHAMISA What is your name? 

00:13:25
LAWRENCE CURRY Or negative actions as Tony did, our choices are having an impact on how our brains grow and develop. 

00:13:30
CHOICES & YOUR BRAIN 

00:13:35
LAWRENCE CURRY Here is how it works. Our brains are made up of three parts. The cortex, our thinking brain. The limbic center, our feeling brain. And the brain stem, our action brain. Each part connects with others to a network of pathways made up of nerve cells and receptors. These nerve cells can go stronger or weaker depending on our experience and choices we make. 

00:14:05
JEFFREY ROWE , M.D. Clinical Director San Diego County Mental Health Services So, just day-to-day how do choices make your brain grow differently. And one thing you have to know about nerve cells is, if you stimulate them they get stronger, they get bigger and they send up more branches. If you don’t stimulate them, the structure shrivel up, they won't die exactly but the structure shrivel up. Nerve endings will pull back and receptors will stop growing. So, if your experience is that when you have a feeling you act that, feeling broom act without any separation. Those pathways of, I’ve got that emotional experience coming up here and I am gonna act on it. If that happens right away, then that connection is bit stronger. But if you have an emotional experience and you can put a little bit of time between that and take some breaths, slow down. Then that connection between having that emotional experience and acting is decreased. Those nerves pull back, the receptors shrivel up. Now if you can do something else, put something else in the pattern like exercise. If you just exercise everyday half hour, lift weights, run, walk wherever it is, the intestacy of this limbic area slows down. It’s almost like have a feeling, take a look at what are your options, why are you feeling this way, let me talk to somebody about it and put some separation and that immediate reaction is short circuited. And that’s one of the great things is when given a new opportunity or a new person to connect to or discovering something new about yourself, you can lay down new memories and new connections about that. And it can change your life. 

00:15:30
The Steps to Change 

00:15:35
NAZARETH First you gotto realize that you know you are not perfect. You gotto realize that you can’t… you know lot of times, lot of things that happen they're your fault. You know you are the one that brought that energy in to whatever the situation maybe. You know, you should have to, you know be responsible for your… your actions. 

00:15:50
Taking Responsibility 

00:15:50
MIESHA Yeah, 'cos I looked at my grades at the end of the year, it's like, oh my gosh (inaudible ). 

00:15:57
STEPHANIE I used to get kicked out of school and spend time for fighting. I used to do like all this trauma. 

00:16:05
TIM It’s the biggest regret I have is just hitting… hitting 'em, 'cos like everyone looked that me as some weak guy like why did you hit him like, would you get out of that? Are you something special now? It makes you better than anybody? And it doesn’t. It’s like, and it was hallow. 

00:16:20
Understanding Consequences 

00:16:25
NEGUSSIE Like if you’re mad and like angry comes, sometimes like overcomes you and it like, it makes you not thinking, you do something like out of like revenge or something, and you don't really think what the consequences are. 

00:16:35
STEPHANIE Well, after you do all that and you go back and think about it, it’s like there is no point. Are you doing it instead of trying to fit in and be cool about it? You're just letting yourself down, because then at the the year when you have to graduate, you have to make all these stuff uh like… 

00:16:50
TIM I got people looking at me as somebody who is just all around violent, not a good person, nobody trusts me anymore. Don’t think that… that proves what a man you are, is being able to walk away, like you know it. They don’t run my life. The minute you hit somebody is the minute you left them run your life. The minute I hit the person I hit, now they control every aspect of my life, not so much damn in person, but probation, schools. I have no control over what I do, what I say. 

00:17:15
ASHLEY You said that you make fun at somebody. The next day they it consider and try to hurt themselves because of what you said and then you will feel like, wow, I made this person do that! So every action has it consequences. 

00:17:30
STEPHANIE Yeah, whatever you do, whatever you do bad is gonna, is gonna come back to you. Basically, that’s the way I see it. 

00:17:35
TIM Because you make your own destiny. I mean, the smallest things you do can have the… the biggest dramatic effect of over everything. 

00:17:40
NAZARETH You put positive energy out positive energy will come back, you know if you put negative energy out negative energy is gonna come back. 

00:17:50
Make a Commitment to Change 

00:17:50
MIESHA I got mad and well start feeling like well was bad and I'll say, all in my GPA is like not even enough to play soccer. That was actually… 

00:18:00
ASHLEY It’s just motivating yourself, keeping yourself of be on top of things, not letting yourself fall down and be miserable. I'll say, 3-2-1, 1-2-3, what the heck is bothering me. It works. 

00:18:15
STEPANIE I try not to have an attitude now, like if they look at me like, oh whatever you know I… I’m gonna ignore it, because I did not come all the way up here just for a little thing to bring me down here. 

00:18:25
TIM If you have the opportunity, if you have the time to sit there, think about what you wanna do with yourself, think about all that stuff, I mean, it's not fun being backed into what, where you have to think about those stuff and where you have to realize all the stuff you did wrong. I mean, when you’re forced to look at this stuff, it's not as easy as when you think just look at yourself, I'm alright, this is what I have to do, this is what I need to get done, and it’s just easier to do it that way than before it can be told. You have to do this or this is the consequence you have to do this or else you're gonna juvenile off. It's just not burning, makes you feel like you have no control of your life whatsoever. 

00:18:55
It’s Never Too Late to Change 

00:19:00
TONY HICKS My mind just started opening up. Basically, what I had done and this what I was until ah… it was a slow process. I can’t set up in all at once it was a very slow process and I… umm… owe a lot of thanks to my grandfather and… and Azim and others for… ah… for kind of walking me through that process. I mean, it's always a struggle to make decisions and to make the right decisions. And I don’t always make the right decisions. I mean, I’ve… I've… I've proven that. And prison isn't the ah… this isn't an excuse. (Inaudible ) prison isn't a conducive environment or hasn’t been a conducive environment for me to be able to get things out. But luckily, I've had ah… individuals in my life who… who all were listening and instead of going in, I mean, living with 'em myself and (inaudible ) I do have a medium to express myself from time to time even when it’s frustrating. 

00:20:00
TASREEN KHAMISA ALAEI What we're doing now in our life is gonna impact our future, our family’s future, possibly our future children and grandchildren’s future. So, if we stop and think before we do something and realize how important it is, what we do today, how we deal with our anger, how we treat other people. If we take all that really seriously and be really conscious of it in our everyday life, then we actually are mapping out our future and… and what that’s gonna be like. 

00:20:30
Follow your Dreams 

00:20:30
PLES FELIX So, again, I wanna encourage you, keep your dreams clearly in your focus and your view, don't let anybody come along to tell you that you can’t realize your dreams and make the right choice. Make the choice to be a peacemaker. 

00:20:50
Work together, spread the peace and to umm… try to make your club a better place and then (inaudible ) and there is a world.
