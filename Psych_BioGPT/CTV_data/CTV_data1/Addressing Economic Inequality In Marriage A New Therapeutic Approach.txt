00:00:30
Case Study #2 Addressing Economic Inequality In Marriage: A New Therapeutic Approach 

00:00:30
NARRATOR - is focused on almost exclusively in the fragments of clinical material which Betty Carter will now present. 

00:00:35
BETTY CARTER  Ann and Raimo came in because Ann complained that their marriage had grown terribly distant. And she felt that they had to work on it now before things got any worse. Raimo came along somewhat bewildered at her insistence. My questioning about their families of origin revealed that Raimo, who is 59 years old, is the oldest of three with two younger sisters. His father died in 1970. His mother died four years ago. His younger daughter was married a year ago and his older one just started graduate school. Raimo was born in Estonia and fled the Russian occupation with his family during World War II when he was 11 years old. The family lived in Germany in a refugee camp until 1949. They emigrated to the United States when Raimo was a teenager. During that period, he saw his father lose everything and then build a new life in a new country in his middle years. Raimo worked hard in school and upon completion of his PhD in Physics, he embarked immediately on two simultaneous careers; teaching and consulting on applied projects in the business sector. On one of these consultations, he met and soon married Ann. Ann, 52, who was raised in Alabama, is the second of five children. Her father was of Eastern-European Jewish ancestry and her mother came from a long line of Southern WASPS. Her mother undertook to raise Ann and her sisters as Southern gentlewomen and told Ann at her wedding in 1965, to keep a smile on your face and never nag. Both of Ann's parents are now dead. After completing the Genogram, I asked them about their respective incomes. 

00:02:55
BETTY CARTER Well that ah, that just about completes the genogram here, but let me ask you just one last thing. Ah, would you tell me how much money each of you earns? What, what's your annual income Raimo, approximately? 

00:03:10
RAIMO Oh, about 250,000 a year. 

00:03:10
BETTY CARTER And how about you, Ann? 

00:03:15
ANN Uhm, I, I don't have any income. I haven't worked outside the home since just after we were married. 

00:03:20
BETTY CARTER I see. Well then, that's quite a disparity then in the way that money is earned in the family, huh? 

00:03:25
ANN Yes. 

00:03:25
BETTY CARTER What impact do you think that has on your relationship? That disparity? 

00:03:30
RAIMO  Well, ah, what do you mean? 

00:03:35
BETTY CARTER Well, what effect does it have? I don't know, in making decisions and who says what? What... (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
RAIMO Well. 

00:03:40
BETTY CARTER  what's the effect of the fact that you make all the money? 

00:03:45
RAIMO Once the money is earned, it's our money. It doesn't seem to have any effect. 

00:03:50
BETTY CARTER Ann, would you agree with that? (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
ANN I don't agree. I, I think it has a great deal of, of ah, impact on our relationship. I never really feel like the money is ours. I always feel like it's yours. And, uhm, I feel like I have to ask him before I can spend anything. 

00:04:10
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. So that sounds almost like, uhm, I don't know, parent and child type arrangement when it comes to the money that you feel. 

00:04:20
ANN Sometimes it feels that way. 

00:04:25
BETTY CARTER Raimo, did you know that Ann felt this way about the money? 

00:04:25
RAIMO  Well, no, ah, it's, I mean, now, come to think of it, sometimes I sort of get the funny feeling that she's not totally happy about something, but, no, I, I, it's pretty much news to me. 

00:04:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Well, you know, Ann, when you called, ah, you said that you felt that there were problems in the relationship with you and Raimo, so would you paint me more of a picture of that now? Could you say more about how you think the relationship is and where you think the difficulties are? 

00:05:00
ANN  Well, I feel, I feel like there's a lot of distance between us now. Raimo works very long hours. He works sometimes, ah, 12, sometimes 14-hour-days in his business and he's gone quite a lot on business trips. And, uhm, it, this didn't used to be a problem when the children were home. I, I filled up my life with their lives. But now that they're gone, uhm, I feel the distance between us more. (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:05:30
ANN And, ah, I see our relationship in ways that I didn't used to see it. 

00:05:35
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
BETTY CARTER Ann wants Raimo to cut back on his work, to think about their retirement, plan trips with her, and perhaps buy a vacation place on the Carolina Shore. 

00:05:50
RAIMO We can't do that. I mean, do you realize how close our expenditures are to our income? There's no way we can add that much extra expense and my taking time off from working and then, ah, buy a house. That, that's, that's totally impossible. I cannot possibly think of starting to retire now. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm not even thinking about it. 

00:06:15
BETTY CARTER You know, as I listen to you two, I, I, I don't feel as if I'm listening to, to equal partners discussing an issue or something. I mean you don't, you really don't sound like peers, you don't sound like you're negotiating or like, ah, you have some equal weight in a, in a joint decision. Ah, ah. 

00:06:35
RAIMO Well, I think we have equal weight in spending the money, but we don't have equal weight in making the money because I'm doing all the work and I'm sure that she wants me to make that money. 

00:06:45
BETTY CARTER  Ann continues to voice her- 

00:06:50
Second Session 

00:06:50
BETTY CARTER - soft complaints about Raimo. I asked Raimo what he's dissatisfied with in their relationship. He mentions again that if Ann knew more about their finances, she wouldn't be so critical of him. 

00:07:05
BETTY CARTER So Raimo, you, you wish that, ah, Ann would actually take more interest in your finances. 

00:07:10
RAIMO Yeah. I think if she understood better, if she understood the whole situation better then she would understand that I have to work and it's not that I want to be away from you that I spend so much time away. We both need the money. 

00:07:25
BETTY CARTER How does she get away with leaving the whole job to you? 

00:07:30
RAIMO Well, I, I don't know. I, I mean, that's the way it has always been. 

00:07:35
BETTY CARTER Does it bother you that she doesn't persist when she wants something from you? 

00:07:40
RAIMO Yeah, it sort of like I have to guess what's on her mind. I mean, it's really kind of news to me that this was such a big problem for her, that, you know, we had to come here and seek some help. I mean, I, I, I, can't read her mind. 

00:08:00
BETTY CARTER What do you think about it, though? Why do you think she gives up on you so easily? 

00:08:05
RAIMO 'Coz she's timid. I don't know. Well, why do you give up so easily? 

00:08:10
ANN I guess I just don't know how to get through to you without causing a fight. I don't want to cause a fight and, uhm, I don't know how to do it. 

00:08:20
BETTY CARTER Raimo, do you ever worry that things could get so distant between you and Ann that you'd end up, I don't know, going, living separate lives or going in different pathways or, listen, even actually separating? 

00:08:35
RAIMO No, I don't think it would come to that. I mean, I think we both would like to spe, spend more time together but we just, you know, there's only 24 hours a day. (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
RAIMO What can I do? 

00:08:50
BETTY CARTER And how about the kids? How about the girls? Do you spend, uhm, do you spend much time with them? 

00:08:55
RAIMO Well, again, as much time as I have when it's (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:09:04
BETTY CARTER Ann's shaking her head. She says, no, you don't. 

00:09:05
RAIMO Well, what do you want me to do? 

00:09:10
ANN Spend less time at work. The family is very important. 

00:09:15
RAIMO But do you really mean that? I mean, suppose you had to cut down on your expenses to make up for that? 

00:09:25
ANN Uh hmm. Yes, that... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
RAIMO That would be all right with you? 

00:09:25
ANN ...that would be all right with me. 

00:09:30
BETTY CARTER It would be all right with Ann. Would it be all right with you? 

00:09:30
RAIMO Well, I mean, I always assumed that, you know, there wasn't much we could change about it. I'm, I'm not sure actually that Ann realizes what she's saying. 

00:09:45
BETTY CARTER Well, right now, what we're really talking about is sort of, I don't know, there's some kind of a trade-off that everybody makes about time and money, you know? And right now, I guess, we're talking a little bit about the lack of time. So, Ann says there isn't enough time and you say there isn't that much time to spend with your kids. And I'm wondering how you're gonna get your wisdom across to your girls if you don't have enough time to really talk with them in-depth about their lives, you know? 

00:10:15
RAIMO Well, I, I don't know. I suppose I just thought of assumed that they would absorb it somehow. 

00:10:20
BETTY CARTER Well, they will, but they (laughs) might not absorb exactly what you have in mind, if you don't have the time to spend with them. 

00:10:30
RAIMO I'm sure they won't, but, ah, I mean, I don't know what to do. 

00:10:35
BETTY CARTER  It's a tough one, isn't it? 

00:10:40
RAIMO It is... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
BETTY CARTER This is a tough one. 

00:10:40
RAIMO ...and we all have to make compromises. 

00:10:40
BETTY CARTER Time and money, it's a tough one. Ann, ah, why do you give up on Raimo so quickly? 

00:10:50
ANN You know, I just try to get through to him and when I can't get through to him without a fight, uhm, I just give up. 

00:10:55
BETTY CARTER  Well, let me ask you, if you weren't so afraid of a fight or afraid of nagging, what is it you really want from him? 

00:11:05
ANN I want him to spend more time with me and I want him to spend more time with our daughters and our son-in-law. And, ah, I want him to begin to think about retirement when we can be together. 

00:11:15
BETTY CARTER  Okay. And he tells you that he'd like you to, you know, be more interested in the money, in the finances. Is it true that you haven't really bothered with him, that you're not really very interested? 

00:11:30
ANN Yeah, I think that's true. Uhm, I guess I never felt the need to bother with him. Uhm, he always took care of it and we never questioned that arrangement. 

00:11:40
BETTY CARTER Ann, which factor do you think contributes most to your feeling that you aren't entitled to more say over things? Is it your Southern belle upbringing or Raimo's need to hold onto the money or secure it? 

00:11:55
ANN I don't, I don't know. I, I never thought about that. I don't know. 

00:12:05
BETTY CARTER Well, as you think about it now, there's a couple of things operating on this arena, aren't there? I mean, on the one hand, it's true that you were taught never to nag, never to argue. On the other hand, it's also true that Raimo feels it's extremely important for him to be sure that things are financially secure. So we got both those factors operating. I think you're both serious, fair-minded people and I, I really don't think there's any intentional power struggle going on between you. I think you both seemed to be operating from very sincere motives. And, ah, therefore, I, I don't do this all the time, but in your situation, I wanna make a kind of offbeat suggestion to you. Are you ready for offbeat? Well, I think that what Ann is really about here is that she wants to sort of re-negotiate your marriage contract with you. She wants to start shifting things in the direction maybe of the next phase, you know. With your kids gone now, the second half of your marriage is gonna be the two of you again as a couple. Am I, am I right about that, Ann? 

00:13:25
ANN Yes. 

00:13:25
BETTY CARTER  I think that's what you have in mind. But, you know, between her upbringing and your elusiveness, she's not really getting this conversation open. She's not really getting the thing rolling. And the other thing is that you don't seem like equals to come, come into the negotiating table as equals. Well, she's nodding and you're looking a little tentative about that, Raimo. Do you, do you know what I mean? 

00:14:00
RAIMO Well, I don't know exactly what we want to negotiate. 

00:14:00
BETTY CARTER  I think it comes more in the area of time. You know, we've been talking about time and money. And now, I guess the focus has, had to be on money up till now to keep your family afloat. And I think Ann's trying to tip it more now towards time. Time maybe for the two of you together. Maybe time for the family to be together, for the girls to come home and bring, well, one of your daughters had just married, isn't she? Yeah, bring her husband home. 

00:14:30
RAIMO Well, it would be nice, but I don't know how I can do it. 

00:14:35
BETTY CARTER Well, that's the point. You don't know how you can do it and Ann doesn't feel really entitled to press you about it. Ann, I think that Raimo really realizes that you're trying to rock the boat here, and he's kinda scared and I think that you could understand that. All of his life, he's counted on his hard work and the money and the investments as a way to keep things secure, so that, well, so that he doesn't lose everything like his father did. It's a way to sort of try to guard against that, you know? So it's not that easy for him to think about shifts like this. It's, it's more risky and so here's the offbeat suggestion. I wonder if it wouldn't be a good idea for the two of you to see a colleague of mine, Adele Holman. She's a mediator. Do you know what a mediator is? 

00:15:35
RAIMO I don't know. It sounds drastic. 

00:15:35
ANN  Is that someone you see when you're splitting up? (laughs) And dividing all your property? 

00:15:45
BETTY CARTER Well, actually that is one of the things she does and, in fact, does most often probably. She works with people who are getting divorced, helping them divide up their property and their assets and stuff like that. But she also just works with couple like yourself who feel that they wanna shift the financial basis of their relationship. And, you know, I kinda think that, that would be a very good thing for you. That before you open up really this negotiating for the future, it would be good for you to shift the basis, so that you're more on a level playing field, so that you're more like equal partners. Well, Raimo, let's talk for a minute about what you'd get out of this. I mean, I guess it seems on the surface, you know, that you've, you'd be losing something, you, you'd be losing control over all of it certainly. So what would you gain? What do you think you'd gain from it? 

00:16:40
RAIMO Well, I might have more time, I suppose actually. 

00:16:45
BETTY CARTER Do you play chess, Raimo? 

00:16:50
RAIMO Ah, no. 

00:16:50
BETTY CARTER No. Well, in chess, you know, there's a sort of, ah, slogan that, ah, a good player wants a worthy adversary. They don't like to play with, they don't like to play a game with someone who's not good enough, not up to par. And I think this would help you to have a worthy adversary here. You might not agree, but you'd have somebody who... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
RAIMO So, at least she can... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
BETTY CARTER ...know what they were talking about. 

00:17:15
RAIMO ...and at least she can tell me what she wants and I, and without giving up? 

00:17:20
BETTY CARTER That's right. I think you'd get that, too. I think you see because this is what I think you would get out of it, Ann, and that is these negotiating skills, a way of being able to say what you want. You see that that's very important to Raimo, so that he doesn't have to read your mind, that you could say what you want, that you'd feel entitled to ask for it, and entitled to pursue the conversation, and that the two of you are really partners in this. Not like you're trying to either, he's reading your mind or ignoring you and you're trying to, ah, you know, bring things up at the right moment or something. I think this would help you shift that. And I think that the bottom line really is that, ah, if things fail in your relationship, this is what you'd have to do anyway. So it's sort of like, why not do it while things are good? 

00:18:15
ANN I think I'd like to try it. 

00:18:15
BETTY CARTER  Good. Good. Raimo? 

00:18:20
RAIMO Well, maybe it will help. I'll, I'll try it. 

00:18:30
BETTY CARTER Good. Good. I think it will help. 

00:18:30
Adele Holman, DSW Mediator 

00:18:30
ADELE HOLMAN  These forms ask for your assets, all of your assets, your liabilities, your income and your projected expenses. Now, you are not expecting to separate, to divorce. This is an opportunity for you to figure out what would be involved if you needed to take care of yourselves. What would two households cost to run? And, ah, this is a time to think about dividing your assets and to actually go through the process so that, Ann, you will have assets of your very own, and you will not have to look to Raimo to take care of you and, ah, you will not have her dependent upon you. 

00:19:20
RAIMO  Well, it sounds like, ah, it, it's just a lot of trouble and, you know, maybe, I mean, do you think that just maybe, ah, if I increased your allowance that, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
ADELE HOLMAN What(ph), excuse me. When I hear the word allowance, I, I always have to interject and say, think in terms of a business partnership. If you were in a business partnership, you would not give an allowance to your partner, am I correct? 

00:19:55
RAIMO Well, that's true. Not a partner. 

00:19:55
ADELE HOLMAN Fine. Well, think of Ann in those terms. She is a partner and a marriage is in many senses like a business arrangement. 

00:20:05
RAIMO That's true, but she's not taking any role in managing the business. 

00:20:10
ADELE HOLMAN Well, this is what we're trying to correct. How do you feel about doing that? 

00:20:15
ANN I think I need to learn how to help manage the business. Uhm, I wasn't trained to do that, I wasn't even trained to think I ought to think about doing that. But, uhm, but I think I'm ready to do it now. 

00:20:25
ADELE HOLMAN Fine. And Raimo, are you ready to have Ann do this now? 

00:20:30
RAIMO Well, I think it's worth a try. You know, we have some money in mutual funds. And I was just thinking maybe if we were to sign that over to your name, it would be totally yours, no questions asked, then that would give you quite a bit more control, wouldn't it? 

00:20:50
ANN How much is it? 

00:20:50
RAIMO Oh, it's about 20,000. Well, I mean, that would, you know, you would be able to have total say over what to do with it. 

00:21:00
ANN  Okay. 

00:21:05
ADELE HOLMAN Ann, uhm, are you aware of what percentage of the total assets this represents? Do you have any idea? 

00:21:15
ANN What, what percentage of the total assets is, are the mutual funds? 

00:21:20
RAIMO Well, I don't know, I mean it's, around maybe seven or eight percent, I guess. 

00:21:25
ADELE HOLMAN Do you feel that this is going to give you a more of a, of a sense of investment in the partnership? 

00:21:30
ANN  Well, it would certainly be more than what I have now, but... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
ADELE HOLMAN If(ph) we(ph). 

00:21:35
ANN ...if we're talking... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
ADELE HOLMAN Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
ANN ...about something that more approaches equality that, then obviously, eight percent or whatever you said it was doesn't do that. 

00:21:45
ADELE HOLMAN So what do you think would, you would like to do about that? 

00:21:50
ANN I guess I'd like to talk about something closer to 50 percent. 

00:21:55
ADELE HOLMAN Ann, I wonder if you know that at, that you already legally own 50 percent of the assets of your partnership, did you know that? 

00:22:05
ANN No. 

00:22:05
RAIMO This is difficult. But, you know, our marriage is really the most important thing for me and I don't want to do anything to risk our marriage. So I will try to go ahead with this. 

00:22:20
ADELE HOLMAN In the coming weeks, we'll be working together and this is going to help the two of you get back on a more equal footing when you work with Betty. You understand that, don't you? Good. 

00:22:30
The Next Session 

00:22:30
BETTY CARTER  After the mediation was completed, Raimo and Ann returned to continue their work with me. 

00:22:40
ANN Raimo, I feel like we're still very far away from each other. I think we're just very distant. We're not spending much time together and, uhm, you're not making time for the children and I feel like, ah, we can't go on this way. 

00:23:00
RAIMO  Well, I still have a lot to do, Ann. 

00:23:05
BETTY CARTER  Raimo, I, I'm wondering how your, uhm, how your own family history might fit in here? Because it almost seems as if for you to let down at all and work to give up any time or to let back at all almost seems like letting down your guard or something. 

00:23:25
RAIMO  Well, yeah, I mean, you've got to keep watching out for, you know, businesses like, uhm, fighting, I mean, I realize it isn't war anymore. 

00:23:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
RAIMO  Ah, I know my father, he used to save money for our, our tuition and, ah, he lost it all. He was doing some research and he had all this data and little index cards and, couldn't take it with us when we left. 

00:24:05
BETTY CARTER So you've really had the experience of, of losing everything and watching your father lose everything he worked for? 

00:24:15
RAIMO Yeah. I mean I don't know how you can ever really get rid of that. It's, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
RAIMO  you know, the world, maybe there isn't a war today, but, ah, business failures and things happen. I mean you can't just sit back and, and relax and say, "Oh, (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
RAIMO ...everything will be fine." 

00:24:35
BETTY CARTER Well, Raimo, maybe, maybe this then has something to do with how you were inducted into this sort of workaholic system that we have over here, you know? Uhm, you have even more at stake here maybe than, ah, than even some of our native-born Americans that we're always complaining about working too hard. 

00:25:00
RAIMO Yeah, at least here, my father couldn't do anything about it. The war came, but at least here, it's up to me... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
RAIMO  ah, if I would work it right, then we won't lose it all. 

00:25:10
BETTY CARTER Maybe you've done it. You've done that and it's worked. And maybe, who knows, maybe now it's your turn to take it a little easier. 

00:25:20
RAIMO  Well, you know, it would be nice. 

00:25:25
BETTY CARTER Wouldn't it? I think we should work on that. 

00:25:30
BETTY CARTER As in every long-term marriage, the hurts and grievances that had been buried along the way now emerged and had to be dealt with before they could move on again together. The difficulty of this marital re-negotiation is underscored by the growing number of divorces that occur after grown children depart from the home. I think this process is especially hard if the couple's power balance is not addressed. Since any agreement made in an unequal context can be rescinded at the whim of the more powerful one, usually the husband, and may not be fully committed to by the one who is less powerful, usually the wife. The mediation intervention addresses the power imbalance, so that the marital re-negotiation required at this phase can take place between two more equal partners. 

00:26:35
BETTY CARTER Separating a man of Raimo's age from "his money" in the name of fairness is not as hard as most people would think unless there's tremendous wealth, in which case, change is often much more difficult anyway. But a middle or upper-middle class man of 60 has already fought most of his battles for competition and achievement. And he's begun to experience the limits and the hollowness of success. And he's somewhat worried about his future well-being. He may be more amenable now than ever before to a revitalization of his relationships and an opportunity to start smelling the roses. If he's lucky, his wife will refuse to continue in the old way and their therapists will support the need for re-negotiating the balance of power between them.
