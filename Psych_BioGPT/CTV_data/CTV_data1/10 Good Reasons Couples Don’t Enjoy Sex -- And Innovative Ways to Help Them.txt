10 Good Reasons Couples Don't Enjoy Sex - And Innovative Ways to Help Them Marty Klein, Ph.D. 

00:01:00
MARTY KLEIN I'm Dr. Marty Klein. If ah, if-- thank you. If Pete were introducing me I'm sure he would say-- where is Pete? There you are in the corner. If Pete were introducing me, he would say a lot of really funny things and then he would say, ah, Dr. Klein he's a licensed marriage and family therapist in Palo Alto near San Francisco and the author of seven books and, ah, ah, most of which are for sale in a bookstore. And I would say, "Oh, Pete." And then he'd say, and then he'd say, "Well, you know, you don't have to buy the books because he's also got this training CDs for sale." You know, so in case you wanna hear Dr. Klein instead of reading Dr. Klein and I'd say, "Pete, enough with that stuff, you know." And then he would say, ah, Pete would say, "You know, Marty Klein has a fabulous monthly newsletter ah, called, Sexual Intelligence which you're gonna get to sign up for today." I know some of you are already signing up. I'll say, "Pete, enough go back to the book thing." So, ah, I've been in practice for 33 years and, ah, my specialty is sexuality. I don't actually think of myself as a sex therapist and I'm telling you this for a reason because what I do for a living, is I do therapy and sometimes the therapy involved sexuality and sometimes it doesn't. I tend to hardly even notice because I like to do a sexuality the way I deal with everything else. And there is this exceptionalism, there was this exceptionalism in our industry as there, ah, which is a reflection of the way things are in the rest of the world which is that, people tend to treat sex different from the way they treat everything else. And I always think that sex is just like everything else, except different. But I think that, I think we, we'd be better off and our patients would be better off if we treated sexuality more like everything else assuming, of course, that we know how to deal with everything else. Okay. Now, here is the common thing that we all see, he says, as I see it, the, the real problem with our relationship is that, when we got married I was too young to recognize mental illness in other people. And now the question is, what do we do about that? So if I were to ask you what do most couples want from sex, what do most people want from sex, what do most men and women-- hi! What do most men and women want from sex. We could spend the afternoon chitchatting about that, okay. So take a second to think about that. What do most people say, what do most people say they want from sex? What do you want from sex? What do most couples want from sex? And, fortunately, nobody here has been drinking so nobody is yelling at, you know, answers that we don't wanna hear. So in my experience what most couple say they want from sex is closeness and pleasure. Some combination of closeness and pleasure. Some combination of closeness and pleasure. For some people it's more of one, for some people it's more of the other. And secondary to that, people want fun, people wanna escape, people wanna feel good about themselves and different people, of course, want different amounts of these things, different people, ah, want some of this way more than other people. I put conception at the bottom of the list, for two reasons. Ah, I wanna remind us that for some people sex is about conception, but I put in for emphasis, I want to remind us that 99% to the sex that people are gonna have around the world this weekend is not for conception. So the fact that people don't talk very much about contraception, the fact that people think of it as sort of an add-on to sex is kind of interesting. And I think our profession does not talk about contraception nearly enough. We especially don't talk about contraception with religious clients. And those are the people we need to talk about it with the most. We are way too polite just-- to, to, to-- in the way that we deal with contraception. I ask everybody, gay and lesbian and heterosexual and everybody else who doesn't have a category, when you have sexual intercourse, when you have penis-vagina intercourse, cuz gays and lesbians do that periodically too, just like straight people have same gender sex periodically, right? I asked, everybody when you have intercourse and it's got to be when you have intercourse, you know, we wanna help people, we wanna remind people intercourse is just one kind of sex, right? Some of my best friends do it, you know. It's, ah, got a lot of, ah, disadvantages too. Intercourse is the only kind of sex that requires an erection. Intercourse is the only kind of sex that requires birth control, it's not a very good way for most women to have an orgasm if that's what they wanna have. So we want to ask clients, when you have intercourse, what kind of birth control do you use? Not do you use inte-- do you use birth control? What kind of birth control do you use? So there's a lot of instruction embedded in that question. When you have intercourse, what kind of birth control do you use? So these are the reasons that couples typically the, ah, have sex. So th-- this is the kind of things that people want from sex, they want pleasure and closeness, whatever that means to them and some people want some amount of validation or self-expression or escape. Now, a lot of people think that the way to make sex better and I put that in quotation marks cuz I don't talk about making sex better, I talk about people creating sex that they enjoy more. It's not making sex better as if there is some objective list. It's not making sex better as if we have a checklist and we say "Well, you know, got horny, got wet, you know, was so wet, fell off the bed, you know, from the slashing or, you know, made enough noise to annoy the neighbors," no. So, uhm, it, it's not a matter of making sex better, it's a matter of helping people create sexual experiences that they enjoy more. And that's gonna look different for different people. It's even gonna look different for the same person from one part of their life to another or from one partner to another. You know, somebody has more than one partner. You know, with one partner what they enjoy from sex is gonna be this thing, from another partner what they enjoy from sex might be very different. But whatever it is that people want from sex, our instinct of, "Okay, we've got to make them function better," function better is the wrong instinct. Our idea that-- which mirrors the social idea perfectly, which mirrors the cultural idea perfectly that what, ah, what sex is about is what your penis or your vulva does, that's what sex is about. And if you want to enjoy sex more, the thing is to get your penis or your vulva to do more tricks. Get your penis to jump through more hoops or, or bigger hoops or smaller hoops, I don't know. Ah, enhancing genital function is not the answer for most people to create sex that they enjoy more. And, in fact, people's allegiance to genital functioning isn't the solution, it's the problem. If you asked a lot of people particularly people who don't enjoy sex very much, if you ask them, "What are you thinking about during sex?" A lot of people are thinking about I hope I get it up, I hope I keep it up, I hope I don't come too fast, I hope I do come at all, I hope I get wet, I hope I didn't get too wet, I hope I don't wet the bed, I hope, you know, I don't call out the wrong name when I climax. So people are way too focused on what their penis or their vulva is doing rather than focusing on what's their experience. And so if people come to us and they say they want to have better sex, if we focus on enhancing their genital function, that's probably not gonna be helpful to them. And if people come in and they say, they want our help in enhancing their genital function, we need to ask why do you want that? Why do you want that? "Oh, doc, you know, you got, you got to help me get, get you know, my ah, you know, it doesn't, ah, you know." That's a very-- what is this? Okay. That's a very common presenting problem in my practice. Guys come in and they say, "Ah, hi doc, yeah, what I'm doing here is my you know, it doesn't, ah, you know." And I say, "Ah, actually, no, I don't know. What do you mean?" They say, "Aren't you that sex therapist guy?" I say, "Yeah. So tell me what the problem is." Well, "You know, I don't, ah, what you want me to spell it out?" I said, "Yeah." That's the first part of the therapy, spelling it out, right? It's not the you know. Well, you know, I don't get wood, I don't get, you know, my thing doesn't like powe-- you-- I mean, do-- yo-- do you need me to spell it out? And I say, yeah, I need you to spell it out, if you can't tell me, you can't tell your partner. And if you can't tell me, you might not even the right, ah, a sufficient vocabulary when you talk to yourself. Then there are the guys you come in, they said, "I have ED," ED, they used to be called impotence, now it's ED, you know, ED stands for, right? Erectile dysfunction. I'll tell you when I hear the word, dysfunction my testicle shrivel right up. Dysfunction. Guy say, they have ED, I say, tell me what you mean. They say what? Aren't you that sex therapy guy? Yeah, I'm the sex therapy guy. What do you mean by ED? Here is my technical expression for what other people call ED, so you don't get it up when you want to. You don't get it up when you want to, and you know, what the important part of that phrase is, it's not the don't get it up part, it's the when you want to part. So you don't get wet when you want to. So you don't climax when you want to. So you don't feel desire when you want to. That's what we're gonna talk about today, the when you want to part. So something is not happening when you want it to happen. And you think it's a problem that we got to fix. I say to the patient, "Well, let's see, maybe yes, maybe no." Now, if people are not enjoying the sex that they are having, now, at lot of people come in and they say, we, we don't have sex very much, we wanna have more sex, right, or he wants some more sex or, you know, maybe you can help us cuz she wants more sex and, you know, I'm too tired or whatever it is. If people are not enjoying the sex together then helping them have more of it doesn't make a lot sense. But I, but I hear this a lot, you know, it's kind of like two people eating at, at Denny's or-- and saying, you know, the, the food here isn't very good and the other person says, yeah, and the portions are so small. All right. So I can wait, I can be patient, it's an important part of sex, timing. We are often asked to help people, we're often-- and, and one of the ways that this sometimes looks is, you get a couple coming in and one of them and it can be either partner, I don't find a lot of gender differences in this. You know, one part and it comes dragging the other one in and, you know, "Ah, hi, doc, uhm, you know, this person doesn't want to have a lot sex with me, so would you please help us so that this person will want to have more sex with me." And then I ask this person, "How do you enjoy the sex?" Cuz I figure that if this person doesn't wanna have sex very much, they're probably not very enthusiastic, I don't know if you've ever had sex with a person who is not very enthusiastic, it's ah, ah. So I say, well, how do you enjoy the sex and the person says "Well, it's kind of, ah," and I say, "Well, if the sex is kind of, ah, why do you want more of it?" So actually when people come in and one person says, "This person doesn't want to have a lot of sex with me, and I want more of it," and I say, "Well, you know, why do you want more of it?" Uhm, ah, ah, you know, the person well, says, kind of, ah, I think well, you know, maybe what we need here is less sex instead of more sex. And then that's when the person well, aren't you that sex therapy guy? See, I get asked this a lot. I think when people are having sexual difficulties and they think they need to have more sex, encouraging them to have less sex can be a very powerful intervention or, or encouraging them to have less sex of a certain kind like no intercourse for 60 days or no intercourse for 90 days. No sex, no sex for 90 days? No, no intercourse for 90 days if it's a heterosexual couples. So let's, let's look at 10 good reasons that couples don't enjoy sex. How many people have either downloaded the handouts or they are looking at them on some new-fangled machine? So hardly anybody. Okay. Well, just scribble away then or ah, you can email me afterwards and I'll be happy to send you the handouts. Ten good reasons couples don't enjoy sex. Well, there's a lot of reasons, you know, we, we could have done 20 good reasons that couples don't have sex but we only had two hours for Dr. Klein, so I-- it turns out I need two hours for 10 reasons, three hours for 20 reasons, all day for 40 reasons. So 10 good reasons couples don't enjoy sex and you may have experienced some of this in your own life, you certainly have experienced most or all of this in the couples that you see in the office. And you'll notice that on this list of 10 things, 10 good reasons couples don't enjoy sex, we don't have ED, we don't have doesn't get wet. We don't have that. We don't have reasons that have to do with functioning. We have such boring things as power struggles. We have such boring things as motions about non-sexual things. Oh, how boring, gee it's a good thing that I know, that I know more than just sex, you know, it's not enough to be a sex therapist if you want to deal with sex, you got to know about people. There are people attached to these things, right? There are people attached to these things and if you want this stuff to do other stuff you got to deal with the people that are attached to these things. It's kind of a law of nature. Actually it is a law of nature. Now, here is reason number 11, ah, remember we're talking about good reasons couples don't enjoy sex, there's one more. I throw this in for free, because it hurts or it doesn't feel good. Because it hurts or it doesn't feel good. When you think about painful sex, don't just think about women. People of all genders can experience physical pain with sex.

 Can you go back to the 10? 

00:16:45
MARTY KLEIN Can we go back to the 10? How about if I promise that we'll, we'll be talking about those 10 for the next hour and a half and then we'll, we'll just go through them one by one, ah, too late. So it's just a little tease, tease is part of the whole thing, you know, as long as you deliver, see that's the thing. Teasing is okay if you deliver, if you don't deliver then it's not teasing, it's sadism. And there's a place for sadism in relationships but it's a small place. Reason number 11, it hurts or doesn't feel good. Sex can be boring, you know. Sex can be boring. And when it's boring that means that you have to have a really good reason to do it. And that reason maybe fear of punishment or that reason maybe, you know, self-loathing or maybe some other reason. We'll talk about this as we go along. Well, ah, couldn't you just scream when you climaxed? Ah, so here's a person who's not having boring sex, not having boring sex. Here is a person who is not having boring sex. So why people don't initiate sex? Why people don't initiate sex? Number one reason people don't initiate sex is because they don't expect to enjoy it. Now, when a person anticipates not enjoying something and they don't initiate that activity, I don't call that a dysfunction, I call that common sense. Now, sometimes, sometimes a person anticipates that they are not going to enjoy something and it has nothing to do with the thing, it's about a preconceived notion. But if a person has a preconceived notion even if it's inaccurate that they are not gonna enjoy something and then they don't initiate it, that sounds pretty smart to me. Let me give you an example. Ah, I have an office in Palo Alto, which is ah, halfway between San Jose and San Francisco. And across the street from my office, there's a restaurant called Antonio's, Antonio's Nut House actually, Antonio's. And, uhm, if you, if you come to Palo Alto and you say to me, "Hey, let's go have lunch in Antonio's," I would say, "Hmm, no, I don't want to have lunch in Antonio's," and you would say, "Oh, are you low desire for lunch?" And, and I would say, "No, I'm low desire for lunch in Antonio's," you might say why. I said, "Well, in Antonio's and that, that you've been there so you know, in Antonio's the seats are uncomfortable and the menu is very limited and the food is awful and the service is very bad and they have this sports TV blaring ah, on the, uhm, on the walls." So I do not expect to have a good lunch experience at Antonio's and so if you said, "Let's go to Antonio's," I would say, "No, thank you." Now, let's just suppose, let's just suppose that, ah, while I'm here in Manhattan Beach, somebody buys Antonio's and in a, in a, in a whirlwind of activity not only did they buy it, they, they completely change it, you know, they take out all of those uncomfortable chairs and they put in some new fabulous comfortable, ah, seats and they, ah, they fired the whole staff, they get new people, they train them, they have a great new chef from San Francisco, of course, they have a great new chef, they get rid of the sports TVs, expand the menu and this is all happening as I'm here with you. Now, if after the talk you come up to me and you say, "Hey, I'm gonna be in Palo Alto next week. Let's go have lunch in Antonio's." I would say, "No, I don't want to go to Antonio's. It's terrible there," because I don't realize that things have changed in Antonio's. But still it make sense, doesn't it? That because I don't anticipate a good experience, I don't want to do it. So this is sort of a miniature example of how trauma works. You know, somebody has a trauma with a man, or somebody has trauma with three women, sequentially and then they decide that, oh, all man or all women are, ah, unpleasant to deal with or they have some trauma around sex or some unfortunate experiences, it doesn't have to be trauma, somebody can have perfectly relaxed unpleasant experiences or it's just boring experiences with sex, you know, people's first sexual experience is frequently kind of, "This is what I've waited for?" So, you know, somebody could have this is what I waited for. And then they have sex with two or three other people and it's all "Well, this is much better than the first time." And so they just sort of figure "Well, I guess this whole sex thing just isn't worth the trouble." And so if they finally meet somebody with whom the sex could be really enjoyable, they say, "Oh, I already know what Antonio's is like," I don't, I don't need to investigate another partner or a new physician. I don't need to, ah, to go to therapy or I don't know-- I need to understand, you know, tantric this or breathing or this or that. You know, I already know what that sex thing is like. So that's what we get a lot of in the office, people simply don't expect to enjoy it and then they do the logical, intelligent, reasonable thing. And say, "Look, I don't expect to joy-- to enjoy it, so no, I don't want to do it." And sometimes the words that people used for that are, "I'm not in the mood." Sometimes people say, "I have a headache." Sometimes people say, "I'm not one of those sexual people, I'm sorry. I'm not one of those sexual people." Or sometimes people say, "I just couldn't ima-- couldn't possibly get in the mood with the kids in the house." Or "I couldn't get in the mood with your mother visiting us," or "I couldn't get the mood, you know, with the laundry the way it is," or "I couldn't get in the mood, ah, because I have to get up early for, for work tomorrow," or whatever it is. But frequently, all of that is just a fancied up way of saying, "Look, you know, why bother to have sex? I don't think that's going to be that enjoyable." Or let's, let's talk about a similar situation but really different, let's say you have a couple and one of those companion at marriages where they really do love each other, they even like each other which is not the same thing, right? They love each other, they like each other, they get along great, they enjoyed their lives together a lot, it's just that they don't have sex. Okay. And then, this couple has a free hour and a half on a Sunday afternoon, no obligations, the kids are gone for the weekend, we have a free hour and half what should we do? Oh, well, we could play scrabble. Oh, we love to play scrabble together. Yeah, we could ah, we could take the dogs out for a long walk. Oh, we love taken the dogs out for a long walk, yeah, we could do that. We could ah, oh, you know, we've been meeting to make that special risotto, you know, that takes a long time to stir and everything, we could do that. Oh yeah, we love cooking in the kitchen here. We, we could-- oh, we could use that, ah, Netflix thing that, ah, we have, ah, and we could watch Lawrence of Arabia. Oh, I love watching Lawrence of Arabia, oh. Or we could have sex and, ah, maybe we would enjoy it and maybe it would be a yeah, ah. Now, if you have those choices, what would you do? If you had five guaranteed ways to have a good time with somebody you loved and you had another choice which was, well, maybe it will be entertaining and maybe it will be, ah, what would you do? So we see that too, this is part of the dynamic of one reason that people don't have sex, one reason that nobody initiates sex in that couple, you know, this is a real good answer to. They love each other, they like each other, why, why doesn't either one initiates sex because each one is saying, "Well, I could initiate sex but, you know, it might turn out to be well, that was a wasted hour and a half," or I could say "Let's play scrabble, we'll have a great time." So why else, why else don't people initiate sex? Well, they, they figure their partner is going to say no anyway, that's a common reason or they, they think their partners is going to criticize them. Have sex with you after the way you treated me yesterday? Have sex with you with all that laundry over here that you said you were going to do? Some people are tired of initiating. It's interesting. I get a lot of couples, ah, where one person says this, this, this, this and on top of everything else, I'm the one who always has to initiate. You know, as if there is something in the US constitution, life, liberty and you only have to initiate half the time. So when people say to me, ah, this-- they, they have the following complaint this, this, this and this, and if we're ever going to have sex, I have to initiate and say, well, what's wrong with that? They say, "You're that sex therapy guy, right?" Yeah, same guy. So what's the problem that you have to initiate all the time? And people generally say, as you would expect, if you ask the question people say, some version of "Well, I don't feel very desired. I don't feel very special. I don't feel very attractive. I don't feel, uhm, like my partner really cares one way or another if we have sex." So the problem is not that your partner is not initiating and the partner's how you feel about the fact that they are not initiating. I mean, we could arrange for your partner to initiate and you still feel like crap so what do you gain? Or we could heal the sexual relationship, maybe. We could heal the sexual relationship and you both decide that, so you initiate 100% of the time, so what? I mean, the, the point is not who initiates, the point is, do you get to have a good time. You know, most people don't say, when they come to your house, you know, for dinner, they don't say, ah, "Well, you know, personally I would like dessert but I couldn't possibly enjoy it if I were the one, who said, hey, you got to need dessert? No, no, no you have to initiate, hey we've got dessert, oh, good. Let's have some dessert." So I mean, if I go to your house for dinner and you say, "Ah, do you want anything else?" I said, "Yeah, you got any ice cream?" And if you say yes, I don't enjoy it less cuz I was the one with the idea. So some people get tired of initiating. When people say they are tired of initiating what they typically mean is they are tired of initiating and the other person says, no, or they are tired of initiating when the other person acquiesced to sex, it's not very enjoyable, that's what people really mean. So while I do psychodynamic work, I want to get people talking about their actual experience rather than using, uhm, abstractions or categories. You got to talk-- in my office you got to talk about your actual experience. So and then she doesn't initiate very much, oh gee, you poor thing, let's see if we can get her initiate or no. What's the problem with her not initiating? Well, I feel such and such, ah, let's talk about that. So, uhm, some people don't initiate sex, uhm, because uhm, it's been a long time since they last had sex and I want to talk about this. How many people play or used to play tennis? Lots of people. How many people know that Pete is an excellent tennis player? Yes. Pete Pearson, great tennis player. So we've divided up the world, I do this, you do the tennis thing. Perfect. So if you play tennis, if you play tennis, you got to have a racket, you got to have some balls, you got to have shorts, ah, and you got to have sneakers and you got to have socks. All right. So if I-- if, if, if someone says to you-- it, it-- so if you're a tennis player and you say to somebody else, "Oh gee, you-- ah, you're a nice person, I just met you at the Couples Conference, you live in my town, do you want to play tennis sometime? The other person, "Yeah, let's play tennis sometime. I haven't played tennis for a long time. Uhm, I haven't played tennis, oh, in about six months." And then you think, "Oh, gee, that was a mistake." Ah, you only played tennis six months and I'm asking do you want to play tennis because I, you know, we played like three times a week. So if I say to you let's play tennis and you only played tennis twice a year, you go home-- that, that person goes home who only plays tennis twice a year. They go home and the first thing they say is now, "Where did I leave that tennis racket?" And then they say, "Hmm, I wonder if I have a can of fresh balls in the closet," uhm, then they rummage to the closet and maybe they do, maybe they don't and say, "Oh, my sneakers." I think, uhm, I think the last time I wear those sneakers I thought they didn't fit so well and I threw them away, I'm going to have to check on that. And socks, yeah, I got plenty of socks, that's cool. Shorts, uhm, I have shorts but I don't really like the way they look on me. So since I lost that, a few pounds, so well, I guess to have to lessen my shorts." It's also like a big project whereas if you say to somebody who plays tennis all the time, hey, you want to play tennis next week, he say, yeah, sure and they know exactly where their racket is, they know they always have two or three cans of fresh balls on the closet, they have more than one pair of short, so if one is in the wash, they don't have to worry about it and of course, they have an extra pair of sneakers in the trunk of the car and so on. So if you play tennis all the time. You've got your tennis infrastructure all set up and you don't have to do anything in order to play tennis. If you only play tennis twice a year, we're going to come to sex, trust me, will you. A little discontent, rippling to the group over here. If-- but if you only play tennis twice a year, you don't have the infrastructure in place and it becomes a big project just to play tennis, right? Right. Good. Now, let's talk about sex. Couples who have sex on a regular basis and I don't mean everyday, I mean, a regular basis could be once every two weeks could be once a month but couples who are in the rhythm could be once every six weeks. But couples who are in the rhythm of we know we have sex periodically, we know we have sex on a regular basis. They have the infrastructure all set up, they don't run out of lube because they know oh, gee we're getting low on lube next time, you go to the store and by some lube, right. They have their vocabulary in place, whether it's you know or whether it's a vulva or whatever it is. Have their vocabulary in place, they remember from one time to the next. When I was at your left nipple, you don't want me to touch your right nipple, I can never remember. Now, if you have sex on a regular basis you remember that stuff. So couples who have sex on a regular basis, the very next time they have sex it's not that bigger deal to start having sex. But couples who have sex infrequently, like they don't know when the next time they're gonna have sex is, it might be three or four months away and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with having sex once every three or four months, that's not the point. But couples who are not in the routine of having sex periodically, when someone finally says, hey how about it? The other person says, ah, okay. Then, you know, everybody got to scrabble around like, ah, where is the bed and ah, do we have lube, oh, do we have condoms, I think we ran out of condoms or I-- there should be some diaphragm and cream somewhere on the glove compartment or something and, ah, oh, ah, you know, don't forget you know, my back hurts. So when couples are not in the routine of having sex on a regular basis, the emotional cause of starting up, of cranking up the sex thing is huge. And you can have two people in that couple, both people on the couple, they really want to have sex, but it just feels like such a big project. And so nobody initiates. And the longer couples go without having sex, the more difficult it is for anybody to initiate. And there is sort of an intuitive threshold that couples can reach. Once couples don't have sex for about six months, for some couples it's more, for some couples it's less, once couples don't have sex for a year, once couples don't have sex for five months, you know, whatever it is for this particular couple, sex starts to become like unthinkable. It, it, it starts to become something that we used to do. Like if you use to be at really physically active and because of injuries or whatever, you know, you become gradually less and less physically active, you used to play three sports and then you played two sports and then you kind of stop going to the gym and then gradually, you turn into my father and, ah, you know, and then the idea of come on dad, let's go, let's go for a run, come on dad, let's hop on, you know, we'll rent bikes and we'll go for a bike ride. You know, for my dad, that was just by the time he got to a certain age, it was just unthinkable like that was something he used to do and just doesn't do anymore. And for lot of our couples, they love each other, they like each other but sex is just something they used to do because getting and going again is such a big project. Getting people to talk about this honestly is really important. They can talk about their grief about it, they could talk about their embarrassment. They can talk about their humiliation. Because one thing about sex in this culture, it's everywhere all the time. So for couples who don't have sex, they have this really shameful secret. Every movie that they see is potentially a disaster cuz you never know when there was going to be a scene in the movie where people are either having sex or people are not having sex. The most, the most benign film, you know, could be, could be Lincoln, it could be, it could Jo-- the Jackie Robinson film, it could be any old film. You know, couples are watching the film, hey great history. Hey great architecture, great lighting. Good acting. Great music. Oh no, now they are kissing passionately, now we have to sit there and watch the people on the screen kiss passionately and pretend that I don't know what you're thinking and pretend that I don't know that you know that I'm feeling uncomfortable. So that sort of side. Say couples who want to have a baby and they can't have a baby and everywhere they look they see babies, right. Well, with sex, multiply that by a thousand. When couples don't have sex, they have a shameful secret and when they go into work on Monday morning, hey, how was your weekend? Oh we had this great romantic weekend, it was my wife's birthday or, you know, the kids were gone this weekend, we kind of, you know, ah, ah, any, any, ah, event where anybody is having a good time is a potential disaster because it could be yeah, it was my an-- it was our anniversary and we had a real romantic time. Yeah, I got a race so I, I took my partner out, you know, we spent Saturday night in a fancy hotel in San Francisco. And people don't have to talk about sex, you know, the social code is, we went away for a weekend, we went away to a fancy place so we had a romantic, that's such a benign word, we had a romantic time. Yeah, I'll give you romance, I'll give you romance. You know, George Bernard Shaw famously said, we don't think of sex decently, so we don't have a decent language with which to discuss it. We got romance, right? We have intimate. We were intimate last week. In my office you can't say that, it's got-- oh, you mean, you were sexual? Yeah, we were into it. You know, you were sexual, got it. Okay. We have all these words but there's no polite way to say, yeah, he bend me over and fuck me, he was great. We don't have a polite way to say that. In fact, you're not suppose to say when you're on the stage in a therapy conference, right? You know, how many hours I spent thinking, should I say that or not? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Now, are you applauding, are you applauding being bent over or are you applaud-- I don't know. Either way, it's okay with me. Uhm, so let's talk about initiating and I want to, I want to talk about the, the, transition from not sex to sex. Everybody knows, everybody knows-- how many people here have been to Hong Kong, raise your hand? Did-- now, if you-- Hong Kong, it's a place. In Hong Kong they take, in Hong Kong restaurants is like a really big thing. Right. I mean, people go to restaurants and when you go to a restaurant, it's a big deal, everybody and people go in groups and the interesting thing about fine dining in Hong Kong is people walk into a restaurant, typically, in groups, people walk into a restaurant, they sit down and within 60 seconds, somebody is expected to order the meal for the whole table and within 90 seconds the food starts coming. It's completely different from the way we do it in the West. Where you walk in, hello, here's your table. My name is Jason, I'll be your server, you know. And, ah, would you like an appetizer have a glass of water, would you like a drink. Oh, look at the art on the walls, isn't that nice. Oh, my dear you look so nice tonight. I like your earrings, you know. Totally different, totally different. In the West, we have this transition activity or this transition zone between not eating and eating. And in Hong Kong, they don't. I'm not making valued judgments about it, I mean, it's great, if you're hungry in Hong Kong. I'm, I'm not, not, not, not making valued judgments. I'm just contrasting that in the West, we ex-- I mean, if you walk into a white table cloth restaurant and as you're sitting down, they, they hand you a menu and that say, what do you want to eat? What would you say? You say, hey, you know, give me a little time, right? I wanna check out the other people and see what everybody is wearing at least before I order, right? So, that transition, that transition between eating and not-- be-- between not eating and eating, very big deal in the West. Now, in lectures, you know, you're at the Couples Conference, right? I'm suppose to start at 3:30, you know, so 3:30, I get up and, you know, I say hello to everybody very nice, but we kind of start, you know, we don't have to do a lot of ceremonies about you know, go to your special place and, you know, all that stuff, no. I'm here to lecture, be quite, let's go. We have very little transition. Now, let's talk about sex. The transition from we're not having sex to we're having sex, for a lot of couples, now, you know, when you're 19 years old, that transition is like almost not inexistence, like hey, what do you say? Great, huh, let's go. You know, but, but when you're not 19, when you're a grown up, when you're a grown up and you have other things going on in your life, you're tired, you got work on your mind, you know, one of the kid is sick, whatever it is, the taxes are coming on April 15th. So, hey, you want to have sex? Well, you know, go slow, you know, like let me unwind a little bit and maybe have a drink or not, you know, let me go to the bathroom, I got to pee before sex, right? Why don't we talk more about this in therapy? Do you pee before sex? No. Why not? Well, I don't want him to know that I'm peeing. What else do you do there in the bathroom? Well, you know, you check to see if you have any food in your teeth before sex, right? Maybe you brush your teeth, maybe you don't. Maybe you gargle or use that, that garlic stuff Michelle was talking about. Uhm, and then, you know, you, you go into the bedroom and you kind of get in and you want to kind of get comfortable and get off for that bed shoulder, you're always on the left not on the right, you know. You know, kiss me a little bit, you know, cuddle me up and tell me you love me and-- or don't. So that transition, that transition from not sex to sex, when people have sex on a regular basis, it's not much of a problem, when people don't have sex frequently that transition can be troubling. And people-- it's not that people don't want to have the sex, it's that transition that's the problem and when that transition is the problem, people end up not having sex cuz they don't want to deal with that transition. Hey, honey, you want to have sex? Well, yeah, I'm perfectly happy to have sex, first let's sit and talk about maybe I'm a little annoyed at you, oh, great. So this is part of the infrastructure of a sexual relationship. How do people go from not sex to sex? And we want to investigate what do people actually do? And I mean, actually do? Like do you put a glass of water on the night table before you have sex? Do you turn the lights on? Do you turn the lights off? Now, I have some couples, I asked them, you know, what, what do you do as part of that process? So I have couple who say, well, I go into the bathroom and I change my clothes and I put on my pajamas and then I get into bed. And then when we have sex, you know. I said, what do you mean, you know? Well, I kind of, kind of unbutton my shirt or, you know, my partner unbuttons my shirt, you know, I take my underwear off under the covers and, and I'm not criticizing that but I'm just imagining what it's like to have sex when people are trying to hide their bodies from each other. And some people they are really graceful about that and some people it's really shameful and they have sex in the dark. So how are you suppose to have sex in the dark, be ashamed to your body, your hands are a little moist from fooling around and then tear open a condom package, forget it. It's just a big hassle. So we really want to know how people make that transition and for some people that transition is so off-putting that they just don't bother to have sex even if they want to, even if they want to. Another issue on initiating is, uhm, is about "No, thank you," is about "No, thank you." Now, in most arenas of life, if couples are in a collaborative or cooperative, cooperative relationship, they are able to say, no thank you to each other about a number of things. Do you want a second cup of coffee? No, thank you. Okay. You know, as oppose to do you want a second of coffee? No, thank you. Gee, is it my coffee? Should I have low coffee making self-esteem. When it comes to sex, there needs to be a way that people can say, no thank you without everybody getting all upset. And what I hear a lot of couple say is, you know, we got into bed and I really thought he was gonna be in the mood, because we had talked about it, you know, this morning over breakfast and, you know, I came home from work early, and you know, kids screw away and we get into bed, you know, and I say, hey, ah, what do you say? And ah, he said, ah, well, actually, uhm, no, and I was just so disappointed, I say, aha, and then what did you do? By the way, it's not and then what happened, it's and then, what did you do cuz things don't happen, right? When we ask people what happened, the embedded instruction is that people are just sort of passive expectators at the TV show of life. And then what happened? No, and then what did you do? Well, I turned over and I went to sleep. Well, wait, slow down here. So you were going to have sex with this person that you have affection for and you were looking for to rubbing your naked body against there's and you are hoping that they would kiss you and cuddle you up and say that they love you. And then they said, no, thank you to sex and you just turned away and went to sleep? Wait, I, I, I kind of don't get that. What about all of that feeling that was accumulating on roots to, I hope we're going to have sex in the next 10 minutes. What happened to all of that? Well, you know, I got rejected, what do you expect? No, he didn't reject you, he rejected sex with you. There's a big difference. And then, of course, I have to illustrate what does it mean to reject you. Let me show you what it means to reject you. Sex with you? I'd rather two glass. Sex with you? That's the most disgusting idea I have ever heard. Sex with you? I rather go and live in Russia for God's sake in the winter time. Sex with you? What kind of a moron do you think I am that I would have sex with you? That's what it looks-- tha-- does he do that, no? Ah, then I don't think he's rejecting you, I think he is rejecting sex with you. Well, how do you expect me to feel about that? Well, I don't expect you to feel any particular way about that but you do have the option of saying, "Oh, darn, well, let's at least hug a little bit and you know, this is your option where you can say you love me right now, even though we're not going to have sex, thank you, thank you." So every couple needs to have a way of one person saying, no thank you to sex without people having to collapse, you know, at the moment where someone says, let's have sex, they are accessing the relationship. They are creating the erotic relationship for a moment, they are inviting their partner to join them and then when the-- if-- in some couples when the other person says, no thank you, that whole, uhm, construction process just collapses. And there are two separate people like this all of a sudden. They go from maybe we're going to have sex to I guess we're just two separate people in a flash. And we want to challenge the normal, the, the normalcy of that. We want to ch-- well, what happened to your feelings? Well, I was disappointed, yeah, and what about those other feelings because the hallmark of a sophisticated adult is the ability to have more than one feeling at a time, to feel annoyed and affectionate at the same time, to feel disappointed and friendly at the same time. That's what adults had requires. We're always trying to teach kids about that, right? We're always saying to the kids, yeah, I know you're unhappy about that, but that doesn't give you the right to make everybody around you miserable, we're always saying that to children. Particularly when they move back home. So, -

00:49:30
MARTY KLEIN - I assume that's a no. 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:40
MARTY KLEIN I assume that's a no. Well, at least, he's asking for clarification. So, what do we need internally to help couples talk about sex? To help couples talk about sex. I'm e-- I'm not even up to, to help couples have sex. Why do we need to help couples discuss sex? We need, ah, health, ah-- we need a vision of healthy sexuality. Now, if you're my age, you've probably gone to a doctor because some damn thing was wrong with your body and in my case, it was my knees which is why I don't play tennis anymore. And when I sought out a physician, I didn't just want a doctor who knew about damaged knees, I wanted a doctor who also knew about healthy knees, right? So it's not enough that we're all experts in distortions of sexuality. It's not enough that we know about trauma and sexual violence and sexual exploitation of children. We need a vision of healthy sexuality. What does that mean? And I'll give you a hint, it's not as simple as, well, these activities are okay. That's a bad way to approach a vision of healthy sexuality. It's not, well, if you put your finger in this hole it's okay, but if you, if you put your finger in that hole it's not okay. It's not enough to say, well, you know, if Oprah thinks it's okay, it's okay. If Oprah doesn't think it's okay, it's probably kind of Kinky, no. The way, the way to, to start developing a vision of healthy sexuality would be about values, it would be about values, it would be about honesty perhaps. It would be about responsibility, it would be about consent. And then, it would be about decision making, how do you make decisions around sex, if you're coming from a place of shame, we probably-- we, we think that's probably not so good. If you're coming from a place of I want to share a gift with you and I'm doing it in a way that makes you feel good, we might say, "Yeah, that sounds okay," regardless of what the activity is. Let's go take a shower and let me wash your hair and kiss your neck. You know, if that's coming from a good place, then we might think okay, that fits into a vision of healthy sexuality. Now, some, some of our faith oriented patients, they are saying, oh, there is already a guide to healthy sexuality. And all we have to do is follow what it says in the bible. What turns out at the bible on the one hand is ambiguous about a lot of stuff, do you know that some people think the bible was written in English. I asked all my faith based patients, all of my patients are interested involving faith. What language do you think the bible is written? And then I said, go home and find out. I mean, I know the answer but I said, go home and find out, get them to, to think about the bible in different way. But some people think, well, the bible tells us exactly what kind of sex they have or God tells us exactly what a vision of healthy sexuality is. But here is the thing, and this is what I say to my religiously oriented patients. I say, you know, this is again the way I talked to them not necessary the way I would talk to you or my best friend or myself. I say, you know, God has apparently given you this divine gift of sexuality, and God has also given you a brain and the idea said, God gives you a brain to administer that divine gift of sexuality, right? They say, ah, yeah. I said, well, uhm, I think you and I can agree that God wants you to administer your divine sexuality in a godly way, right? Yeah. Well, here's the thing, some people think that there's a formula that has to do with which finger goes in which hole. And some people think there's a formula that, if you do it that way, it will be godly sex and if you do it in the other way, it's not godly sex. But here's what I have observed and maybe you have observed this too. There are people and maybe you've have this experience. They have heterosexual, monogamous, matrimonially blessed penis-vagina intercourse and it's not godly, it's filled with shame or manipulation, or physical pain and it's not godly. And then maybe you've had this experience, there are people who are having sexual experiences where it's not necessarily, ah, heterosexual or penis-vagina intercourse or blessed by a matrimony and it is a godly experience. And I think that what God wants is not that we should slavishly follow a formula that demonstrably doesn't always work. No, I think what God wants, if you're a person of faith, that you should administer your sexuality in a godly fashion and it's up to everybody to decide what does that mean, is being honest godly or is being manipulative godly. Everybody's got to figure that out for themselves, I think that's what God wants from my faith based patients or around their sexuality. So we need a vision of healthy sexuality and we need to encourage our patients to develop one too. It's not enough to say, well, do I get wood when I want to. It's not enough to say, do I get wet when I want to. That's, that's trivial, that's trivial. The question is, how do you feel when you're being sexual? How do you feel when you're contemplating being sexual? How do you feel after you're being sexual? So what else do we need? We need for sex to-- we, we need to be willing for sex to be politically incorrect. We need fo-- we need to be okay to keep politics out of the bedroom. The bedroom, you know, that's slang for where people have sex, right? The bedroom or the kitchen, your mileage may vary, the bedroom -- excuse me -- the bedroom is the place where you can actually have a little vacation from everything else if you play it right. And one of the things that you can have a vacation from is political considerations. You don't have to worry about being a feminist when you're in bed. You don't have to worry about being a good Buddhist when you're in bed. You don't have to worry about, uhm, not using disrespectful language when you're in bed. You know, if you want to call this a scented rose garden and your partner knows what that means, that's okay. And if you want to look at your partner and say, pound me with that big thing lover boy, if that works, if that works for both people, if that works for both people, that needs to be okay and we need to get out of the way and let people have their politically incorrect sex as long as it fits with their ultimate values, consent, honesty, all of that. We must not demand that people's sexual fantasies conform to the same rules that their sexual behavior has to conform to. The single most common sexual fantasy for both men and women, is sex with an inappropriate partner and the second most common thing is sex doing an activity that people don't want to do in real life, it makes perfect sense. Why should you brought it to have a sexual fantasy about your husband, you've got your husband. If I wanted to have a sexual fantasy about my husband, I would go and I would actually go do it with my husband, you know. Sexual fantasy is the place where we can have sexual experiences where there are no consequences. You know, if you say to your husband, you know, you know, that guy on your bowling team, that cute guy in your bowling team, you ever think that maybe the three of us could have sex together? Uhm, or you know, both of those guys on your bowling team. You know, and if, and if your husband, if, if your husband says, uhm, I don't think so. And you say, okay, never mind. It was just a thought, it was just a thought, never mind. You know, the next morning, your partner is going to say, your husband is going to say, ah, hey, by the way, ah, run that whole bowling thing by me again cuz I, I could swear I thought that you suggested that you and me and Tom and Joe have sex together. And you said, yeah, but you know, you said, no, never mind. No, no harm, no foul. I mean, you don't want to do it, no problem. You know, your husband might say, oh, wait a second, I want to talk about this, you know, from now until the end of time. Boy, you could have a fantasy about it, you could imagine that's what you're doing during sex if you want to, you could imagine doing it while on you're on the exercise bicycle. You could imagine doing it right now, go right ahead, go right ahead. You can throw a pee in the fantasy if you want to, I don't care. We have to, we have to support patients in understanding that their sexual imagery, their sexual fantasies are separate from their sexual behavior and are judged according to different rules. And if you want to completely kill a couple's sex life, just demand that they have really boring sexual fantasies and that they be nervous about what they imagine. You make people nervous enough about what they imagine and sex becomes almost impossible. Another thing that we need, is we need to reduce gender stereotypes in therapy. We need to understand, we need to understand that a huge number of couples where the complaint is one of them want sex and the other doesn't in heterosexual couples, it's women who are saying, I want more sex and the man saying, no I don't. It's not all these man, all these horny man chasing all these women around the house come on let's have sex. No, no, I don't want to. No, it's not like that. We also have to get rid of gender stereotypes around, uhm, things like spanking and things like, ah, blindfolds and stuff like that. You know, when it comes to S&M, when it comes to sadomasochistic, when it comes, ah, erotic power play, when it comes to the pirate game, aha, it's not just men who are topping women. In fact, if you go to the S&M community, what people are always complaining about is there aren't enough men who want to top women. You know, it's always women who are-- frequently women who wanted to top men. So let's get rid of our gender stereotypes that what sex is about for most couples, heterosexual couples is that, it's a big He-Man, man and its, its, its a little lady in, in a little pencil skirt and, uhm, and he's veracious and she's kind of trying to keep up, it's not always like that. And what I find as I travel around the country lecturing is that there's a lot of assumptions that if there is any spanking going on, it's the man spanking the women and gee isn't that terrible. And the answer is, ah, frequently it's the woman spanking the man and there's nothing wrong with that if both people want that, and if anybody wants to spank anybody as long as everybody is into it, we need to be asking ourselves why that it. And the DSM IV which should burn in hell about this, the DSM IV is no friend, the DSM IV actually talks about victims, victims of sexual S&M. There are no victims of sexual S&M because by definition S&M is consensual. If it's not consensual, it's not S&M. It's violence. Violence we already know a lot about but if it's consensual, it's not violence. S&M is by definition consensual. Ah, what else do we need? We need to get our definitions of what sex is, is for from each individual couple. We let them tell us what sex is for. We don't want to impose our vision on them, sex is for intimacy, sex is for, you know, increasing closeness, sex is for healing, you know, sex might just be for, let's kill a half an hour before the kids come home. Sex might-- I mean, that's what people like to do before they got into their boring old marriages, right? It's like in the early days of the relationship, oh, we have an half an hour, what do you want to do? I know what I wanna do, get over here. And you know, most couples, they come to us, they would kill for that now, they'd been in relationship for14 years, they haven't heard that, I know what I wanna do. Get over here. They haven't heard that voice in a long time. So sex is not just for intima-- intimacy. In healthy couples, sometimes sex is just for killing time. Ah, we need to be willing to ask personal questions, really personal questions. No, no, no, really personal questions. When you masturbate, Joe, when you ejaculate, where does the ejaculate go? Mary, do you use tampons or pads? Why? Now, if you've ever been in-- I was in the Soviet Union, and then I was in Russia, if you've ever been in Russia, they have a very interesting, ah, cultural thing there. Ah, women who menstruate- every know what that means? Good. Well, I didn't know what that meant when I first got married. I got married when I was 21 years old, the first time, I got married when I was 20-- you know, start of marriage. I got married when I was 21, I got married when I was 21 and my wife had this bo-- this blue box under the sink and I never used to know what it was except I'm suppose to keep out of it. I was married for years before I knew that those were tampons and what they were for. I never forgot. So in Russia, here's what they do, in Russia, especially back in the old Soviet days, the women use actual rags, actual cloth, wait, it gets better, they used actual cloth, okay, but what happens to the cloth after it's been used for a few days? Ah, so the wo-- so the-- it's the mother-in-law's job to wash the cloth, the mother-in-law, it's her job to wash the menstrual cloths. Now, don't you think that sets up some interesting family dynamics, there must have been a black market and menstrual blood in few towns, right? So Mary, do you use tampons or pads? Why? Where do you keep the lube? Oh, you keep it in the bathroom. Aha, where do you keep the toothpaste, the bathroom, too. Well, why don't you keep the toothpaste in the bedroom? Well, because I brush my teeth in the bathroom. Aha, so I think you should keep your lube in the bathroom as long as you have sex in the bathroom, right. Oh, you have sex in bed, you might want to consider having lube in the, in the bedroom. Uhm, what if your kids see it? Well, I guess, uhm, maybe they would ask and maybe they wouldn't, if they ask I guess, you could tell them what it is, oh, that's lube, that's what adult use to help make sex more comfortable. What sex? That we're going to talk about a little later in the afternoon. But we should de-- but if you have a kid who says, what's sex, it means, you're behind schedule on the whole sex education thing. I'm not afraid that your kid is gonna ask, "Mommy, what's lube for?" or "What's this product?" or "What are these 88(ph) condoms you have?" Ah, so, so we need to be willing to ask really personal questions. I don't ask the same question of every single patient. But you, you know, this guy, this guy ah, ah, so, so where-- when you masturbate, what happens when you ejaculate, you know, when men masturbate frequently not always, right? Frequently, you know, a few gallon of stuff come out. And, and the question is, the question is, what happens to all that stuff? So I just have one patient about, ah, two years ago, there's one patient and, ah, we got to talking about masturbation which is typically my choice not the, the patient's, talking about masturbation and, ah, I said, well, ah, I-- cuz he, he had never had, quote, unquote, successful intercourse with his wife, they had been married three or four years, they want to have a kid and, ah, somehow although they never actually had successful, their word, not mine. So I said, well, let's call him Joe, well, Joe, uhm, ah, tell me about when you masturbate. He says, well, you know, I, I masturbate and then that's that, I said, what we need a little more de-- detail here. Uhm, so where do you masturbate? Okay. Ah, on your bed. Okay. Here is a critical question, are you laying on your back or on your stomach or you're sitting up? Guys who lay on their stomachs and they masturbate by grinding against the bed, that's incredibly primitive behavior. I mean, imagine a baby who hasn't yet figured out how to use their little hand to do that, right? So I wanna know, I wanna know when you-- for, for guys when you masturbate, ah, you know, what are you doing? For women too, when you masturbate what do you do? I mean, here's a-- here's an interes-- we'll get back to him in a second, when a woman masturbates, does she do that by putting something inside her vagina or does she do that by touching her vulva, by touching her clitoris? That's an important question, that question has-- the answer to that question has implications for that woman's whole sexual relationship whether she's gay or lesbian, or, ah, she's a straight or lesbian, right? I mean, if she says, well, I masturbate by doing this and she's trying to have an orgasm with her partner by having some in and out, in and out, in and out? Well, that helps explain it, right? Lonnie Barbach, you know, she is like the one who helped all of us figure out about this whole clitoris thing. You know, when, when I first-- when I first, ah, was a therapist, you know, the clitoris hadn't been invented yet, you know, we (inaudible ). So Lonnie, Lonnie famously said, I don't know if she even remember saying this, I mean, it made such an impression on me, 35 years ago. Lonnie famously said, if the predominant way that heterosexual people had sex was man rubbing their testicles against women's clitoris', women would be orgasming all over the place and men would be pre-orgasmic. So we want to-- you know, we want to know from women, when you masturbate, do you do that by putting something inside or do you that by rubbing or do you, or do you do both? And then when you have sex to the partner how much of that technology you transfer over. Now, with this guy, I said to him, you know, tell me about when you masturbate, well, you know, I just me-- I said, well, when you ejaculate, I said, do, do you ejaculate? Yeah, and when you, and when you ejaculate what happens to all of the stuff? I said that stuff is called semen, right? He said okay, stuff semen. I said, what happens to all the semen? He says, well, it just goes in the tissue. I said, well, where the tissue come from? He says, well, I always have a tissue in my hand while I'm masturbating. I said, well, doesn't your hand touched your penis? He says, oh, no, I have the tissue there for that. And this is a guy when he puts his penis inside his wife's vagina, he doesn't feel a thing. Well, yeah, after five or 10 or 15 years of rubbing a Kleenex against your penis, of course, you know, the flesh of the inside of a vagina is gonna seem kind of boring, right? So asking this really meticulous questions. Now, you might wonder, well, Dr, Klein, well, Dr. Klein, what do your patient say when you say, pads or tampons? What do your patient say when you say tell me about where, where you ejaculate when you masturbate? Well, I'll tell you the truth, most of them just kind of go along with it, some of them say, don't you think that's kind of a personal question? And I say, yeah, I do, that's why we're here to talk about really personal things. What else does the therapist need? Ah, tolerate the couple have better sex than we do, yeah. We definitely need that, in case co-- you know, some couples they are better sex then we do, you know, what you can do is like raise your rate or something I mean, this-- what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Now, let's talk about what-- the reason that we're here which is, ah, reasons that couples don't enjoy sex, right? See, I told you, we would come back to this list, you were skeptical. I told you we would come back to this. Let's talk about these 10 things. We want to go from the column in the left to the column on the right. We want to go from people feel, the, the things on the left is why people don't enjoy sex, right? The pe-- the thing-- the stuff on the right is where we want to move people so that they can enjoy sex. And it's more likely they are gonna desire it, and it's more likely they are gonna initiate it. But for starters, let's see if we can deal with some of the reasons that one couple or another doesn't enjoy sex. Performance pressure, really, really common. And by the way, people talk about performance pressure or performance anxiety in the office, you know, every-- well, a, well a patient is so sophisticated now right? They've all-- one second, they've all watched over, all our patients are so sophisticated, they come in and they say, so my presenting problem, oh, I have a lot of performance anxiety so then I have to say what's that? And then they say, aren't you the sex therapy guy? Now listen up, when someone says they have, ah, performance issues or they have performance anxiety, I say, what do you mean, and they say, well, you know, when I think about sex, I feel anxious. I say, aha, so you feel anxious. And you want to feel less anxious. So I don't let anybody have performance anxiety which sounds like a disease state. No, we have feelings, we don't have diseases, we have experiences. So we take performance anxiety or performance pressure, we take performance anxiety and we translate that into I feel anxious when I don't want to. And then we talk about okay, talk to me about the circumstances under which you feel anxious. Okay. And then we also talk about well, if you don't want to feel anxious during those circumstances how do you want to feel? Well, I wanna feel less anxious. Yeah, that, that's how you want to feel less. What do you want to feel more? Say, I want more-- I wanna feel more, well, you know, more not so anxious. I think part of our job is to help people envision the place they want to go to. It's not enough to say, I don't want that crap over there, you got to say, well, what do you want, where are we going? Where are we heading? What-- to what do we aspire? And sometimes it takes weeks, you know, they are wanting to talk about sex and I'm wanting to talk about, well, if you don't want to feel anxious, what do you want to feel? It could be relaxed, it could be confident, it could be comfortable, it could be like a real man, you can-- it can be a lot of different things, like a real woman, could be young, could be youthful, could be graceful, could be a lot of things, it could be like my mother approves, it could be I feel spiritual, it could be a lot of things. But I want to know not so much how you, how you don't want to feel, I want to know how you do want to feel and if it takes weeks and weeks for us to talk about that, I'm okay with that. Same thing with couples, you know, couples come in, we've you know, what's the presenting problem we fight all the time. Okay. So what would you like instead? Well, we'd like to fight less, aha, and when you're fighting less, what would that be like, how do you imagine you would feel? Well, we would feel like, hey, we don't fight so much, yeah. And again, it make take them weeks to talk about well, how do we want to feel. What experience of being in a couple do we want? So and we're not even up to, you know, changing this performance pressure or this performance anxiety, I just to get people thinking about it in different way. So when people do in fact feel performance pressure, we want to-- performance pressure basically is, I'm afraid that at sometime in the near future there's gonna be some problem and it's gonna be my fault and so I don't want it to be my fault so I want to do stuff to make sure that some bad thing doesn't happen but I don't feel so confident that I can do that and oh, my God, I'm feeling a lot of pressure and oh, honey, we're you saying something just now? Were you actually caressing me just now? Sorry, I couldn't feel it. I was too concerned about doing something that you're gonna feel terribly disappointed about. So we want to get people to accept, to realize, you know, if you got the contraception thing covered, if you're both furl, if you got the contraception thing covered, nothing can do wrong. No-- that's what makes sex different from everything else in the whole world, there is one thing that makes sex different from everything else and that is, if you got contraception covered, everything is going to be okay. Ah, you had a question over here? 

01:16:00
 (inaudible )? 

01:16:05
MARTY KLEIN Yes. But it's too late. 

01:16:05
 Okay. (inaudible ). 

01:16:07
MARTY KLEIN Yes. 

01:16:07
 Okay. 

01:16:10
MARTY KLEIN Thank you. Uhm, yeah, I always put in more slides that we're gonna use and that way, everybody knows that, hey, life is unfair. Yes. I don't see-- the, the question is, the question is, she says, in my private practice, ah, 99% of the man are demanding more sex from the women and I say, well, you have an unusual private practice. 

01:16:30
 (inaudible ). 

01:16:35
MARTY KLEIN Well, before we say-- before we asked that question, before you asked that question, because we could ask the question, okay, how many people have a private practice where there is a bunch of woman? We're talking about heterosexual people of course, ah, not of course but I mean, we have a man and a woman in bed here. Before we ask that quest-- before we ask that question we would have to ask some questions before that. Well, I'm, I'm not inviting 12,000 questions here now, by the way. Ah, but, but, but before we ask that, before we ask that, I mean, there's a lot of men who say, I want to have more sex. But if you ask a few questions, it turns out that's not what they mean, what they mean is either I'd like sex to be more enjoyable or I'd like my partner to be more physically affectionate or I'd like my partner to be a little nicer to me and be-- for a number of reasons, some of which are cultural and some of which have to do with therapy itself, a lot of men frame that as, I want more sex. I'm sorry. 

01:17:35
 (inaudible ). 

01:17:40
MARTY KLEIN Of course, woman are doing obligatory sex. 

01:17:40
 (inaudible ). 

01:17:50
MARTY KLEIN I'm in agreement, I'm in agreement that there are some horrifying situations where women are having sex when they don't want to. And I want to rescue people from that. I also know that there are situations in which man are having sex if they don't want to. They maybe-- men maybe having sex when they don't want to for different reasons than woman are having sex when they don't want to. When men have sex when they don't want to, it's generally not because of the threat of coercion, it's generally not because of the threat of physical violence, it's generally not because of the threat of ah, ah, ah, pulling out, ah, economic, ah, you know, support, and it's generally not-- women generally don't say, if you don't have sex with me, I'm going to be mean to the kids. So I totally am sympathetic about I see a lot of cases where woman are having sex when they don't want to and it's awful. I also see cases where men are having sex when they don't want to and I think that's awful too. And I don't want anybody to have sex when they don't want to. I don't want anybody to have sex when they don't want to for any reason. And when people say, I mean, here's, here's a real good example of this. I see couples where the woman says, and then we have sex before I'm ready. I hear this. And then we have sex before I'm ready. And by sex she means of course, penis-vagina intercourse. And then we have sex before I'm ready. And I think what she is expecting is that I'm gonna turn to the man and say, you selfish bastard. And indeed he may be a selfish bastard, he may be a clueless bastard which are slightly different from being a selfish bastard. On the other hand, what I want to know from this woman is, you have sex before you're ready? Why do you do that? Tell me about your decision making. And sometimes it's if I don't have sex when he wants it, he's gonna hit me. That's not okay. Sometimes, the answer is, if I don't have sex when he wants it, I know the whole weekend he's gonna be bitching at me, he's gonna be mean to the kids, he's not gonna be nice to my mother all that stuff, that's not okay. Sometimes women say, I have sex when I don't want to because, you know, he works hard, he's a good guy and he enjoy sex, I don't enjoy that much, but he doesn't ask for much and so you know, what I put up with it once a week and it's not the end of the world. So different people have sex when they don't want to for different reasons. I think we all agree without exception that anybody coercing anybody to do anything is a bad-- unambiguously a bad thing. You've been wanting to ask me a question for half an hour now. 

01:20:30
 What makes an important question whether a woman uses a tampon... 

01:20:30
MARTY KLEIN I knew you're gonna ask that. 

01:20:30
 Yeah. 

01:20:35
MARTY KLEIN I knew you were gonna ask that. 

01:20:35
 What, what makes it important whether woman uses ah, tampon or menstrual pad? 

01:20:45
MARTY KLEIN Perfectly reasonable question and I'll, and I'll tell you. Most of the time, I don't ask that question. 

01:20:50
 Okay. 

01:20:50
MARTY KLEIN It's not like I asked that question three times a day. No, I might ask that question like, ah, once every few months. Partly it has to do with the woman's relationship with her own body. Frequently, with women who were not born in the United States, I, I worked in Silicon Valley so I see a lot of people from Asia, I see a lot of people born in China who, who came here when they were like 20 years old for graduate school, right. Uhm, I see people from China, from, ah, Taiwan, from Hong Kong, from India, from Pakistan and a lot of those, a lot of those people have learned to feel really ashamed to their bodies and that their body is not theirs. And the idea of actually going like this and putting a tampon up inside you is just horrifying. And that's one way that I can find out about that, it's not the only way. But, you know, if, if, if we expect people, you don't want to have babies, use a condom, great. You're using a condom requires a certain kind of relationship with your own body and it requires a certain relationship with, uhm, the idea of being sexual. It's actually how I got into the sex field in the first place. I got into family planning. Because in family planning back in, ah, back in the '70s, you know, the idea was, let's give everybody, ah, you know, boatloads of contraceptive equipment and then they'll use it and then we won't have a lot of unwanted pregnancy. Well, it turns out, you give 23-year-olds diaphragms or condoms and they might not use them because they don't want the person that they are with to think that they are slut. They don't want the person that they're with to think they were expecting sex. They don't want the other person to think they're a bad person, they're too drunk to reach into their purse or their, or their, ah, pocket and use the condom. So one of the ways of, uhm, of assessing how a woman feels about her body is well, what do you do about your period and some women say, oh, I'm kind of clueless about that whole thing and I kind of don't leave the house for five days or, you know, some, some women say, uhm, I just put something there and I might say, well, you know, does your husband know what you use? And they look at me like I'm from Mars. So it's just the way of talking about comfortable people are with their sexuality or with their bodies. So let's get back to-- we're gonna shut the microphone so let's get back to addressing reasons that couples don't enjoy sex. Uhm, there's normality anxiety, you know, people are very concerned about whether or not their sexuality is normal. People are concerned, and the way it sounds is, I have better orgasms from masturbating than from real sex, am I normal? "It takes me a real long time to have an orgasm, am I normal" which is kind of an interesting idea. Nobody ever says it takes me so long to finish my ice cream, nobody ever says that. Uhm, in order to have an orgasm, I have to fantasize about the Green Bay Packers, is that normal? And, of course, that's normal, it's when you fantasize about the Boston Red Sox, that's a problem. But, ah, I don't-- we-- we're-- we've only been married a year and we only have sex twice a week, are we normal? Now, just like you, when I was in graduate school, I learned, oh, we have to normalize patients experience, right? We have to normalize, we have to sue them, and it took me years to figure out that, that was the worst possible thing to do. Yes, the worst possible thing to do. I'm not in the business of telling people that their sexuality is normal even when it is, no, I'm not in the business of reassuring people of their sexualities are normal because Oprah is gonna say, no, it isn't. Their sister is gonna say no, it isn't, their priest is gonna say, no it isn't. Cosmopolitan magazine is gonna say it isn't. And the individual therapist that they are saying, well, I'm saying the couple is gonna say, no it isn't. So I don't want to be just one more voice in a chorus of opinions about is your sexual thing normal or not. That's the first reason. The second reason is that, you cannot have normal without abnormal. And when a patient says, you know, ah, I have fantasies about, ah, Tom Cruise when I have sex with my husband, is that normal? Now, if I say, oh, that-- don't worry, that's normal. What I don't know is that she also has fantasies about Susan Sarandon and she doesn't tell me about that because she is certain that I would think that, that's not normal. Once I say such and such is normal, I'm setting up the category, I'm validating the category of not normal. And I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I'm certainly willing to validate the category of I'm not comfortable with it, I don't enjoy it, it's frightening, I'm confused when I do this, I don't like the way it feels, I validate those categories all day long. I drag people into those categories. Those categories, those experiential categories that's where the therapy lives. But the category of normal, I think we should use it very sparingly, very sparingly. I mean, what if somebody says, I mean, let's talk about being gay, okay? Most of us think being gay is okay, but you know what, it's not normal in the sense of statistically being gay is not normal. Being left handed is not normal. In America, being blonde is not normal. In America, a woman playing field hockey is not normal. I don't think we want to get involved in what's normal, I think we want to ask people what do you mean by normal and why is it so important to you to, to know that you're normal cuz people are just begging me, "Come on, doc, you're an expert, you know, how often, how often does the couple like us have sex." I mean, we've been married only a year and we're down to twice a week, does that mean there is something wrong with us? Now, if we were gonna be honest about that, you know, aside from twice a week, excuse me, you know how long it's been since I had sex twice a week? Putting that aside for a second, putting that aside for a second, you know, if this couple wants to have sex twice a week and they enjoy it and it works for them, then twice a week is fine for them. The desire for people to compare their subjective experience with objective criteria, that's the problem. The problem is not how often do you have sex, the problem is that, you don't believe that the two of you together have the right to decide, this works for us, this is okay. And you can extend this idea way beyond sex, way beyond sex. Now, the other way that this is a problem is a couple comes in and one of them says, let's say its these two woman, you know, they aren't a couple and she says, I want to do sex this way and this person says, I don't want to do sex this way and this person says, doc, tell her that everybody does that and tell her it's not normal if she doesn't want to do it. So like she's using normality as a club and this person will say ah, doc, she's way too kinky, I mean, nobody really does that, I mean, except really kinky people. Doc, tell her it's not normal that she likes that. So they, they want to-- people want to use normal as a way of justifying their position. People want to use what's normal as a way of saying, you want to do it my way, you are to want what I want because what I want is normal and what you want isn't. And I don't want to get involve in that. For heaven's sake, I don't want to get involved in that. You've used up your quarter of questions, dear. 

01:29:00
 If you think that a couple is involved in, ah, behavior the-- where they are not concerned the consequences like couple swapping or group sex, would you address thinking about, ah, potential for STDs or a-- other problems? 

01:29:20
MARTY KLEIN Well, you've just asked five different questions there. Ah, here's what I'm gonna say, here's my meta-answer to your questions. Uhm, I am always wanting people to talk about their assessment of the consequences of their behavior not just with sex. Sex is not the most dangerous thing that most people do. Let me say that again. Sex is not the most dangerous thing that most people do. Texting while driving, I ain't kidding. If you text while you drive, please stay away from me. People are worried about their kids looking at pornography, their kids are texting while they are bicycling. If you want to take care of your kids, make sure they are not texting while they are bicycling. Now, the-- so, so the meta-answer to your question is I'm always wanting people to talk about and to be assessing and to be talking to each other about the consequences of their behavior. You know, one of the consequences of, of it, when you know, you don't invite your sister to Thanksgiving just because you know, she insulted, you know, your brother. I mean, we always need to be talking to people about assessing the consequences of their behavior. We, we, when it comes to sex, we may be more concerned about the consequen-- the negative consequences of certain activities because we're uncomfortable with those activities. I think as an industry, we let our patients talk about you went to a prostitute and you e-- you exposed me to an STD, that's mostly a phony argument. It's you went to a prostitute that I don't like. Most people don't get STDs that way. So, ah, I think if, if we're gonna, if, if we're gonna talk to people about you went, you went to group sex, do, do you realize that could have negative consequences, we, we got to ask ourselves why are we talking about the negative consequences of that while we don't talk to couples about "Gee, you went wine tasting for the third weekend in five weeks. Tell me, uhm, how, how do you guys feel about the fact that alcohol is a centerpiece of so much of your entertainment?" Why are we talking about that? So, uhm, when it comes to sex, let's, let's not fall prey to dangerism, let's not fall prey to dangerism. So let's talk some more about, ah, reasons that couples don't enjoy sex. Ah, one of the reasons is, uhm, is emotions and, and, ah, chronic conflict. Let me, let me talk about, about motions and conflict for a second, we're going until 5:30, is that all right? And then part two is after dinner, okay. Uhm, let's talk about conflict for a second. Let's say that a couple of has a spat, is that a great old-fashioned word, it's before you were born, I know. Couple has a spat and a spat lasts for 15 minutes, I mean, spat doesn't take a long time. Spat lasts for 15 minutes. Okay, spat is over. But it's not over really, right? Spats had a long tail, spats have a long tail, people still feel like, "Well, yeah." Right? Spat is over. Ah! Spat is over. I'm, I'm not gonna say anything else about it but, ah, right? That evening, you know, ah, what do you want to watch on TV? Anything is all right. Well, I mean, do you want to this or do you want to try it? Whatever you want is okay with me, I'm tired anyway. Spat has a long tail, it's not active, it's not a hot argument. Now, most couples do not-- adults, no, not, not 19-year-olds. Most adults do not have sex during the week. Most adults have sex on a weekend unless they are having an affair or unless, God forbid, they're in love with somebody new. So most couples in long term relationships, they don't have sex during the week, they got better things to do. So, so most couples, most couples they also do not process conflict very much during the week, because who has the time, right? They may bitch at each other but to actually resolve a conflict, most people don't have the time to do that during the week. So if you add those two things together, what you get is, if you want to prevent sex for an entire weekend, all you have to do is have a spat on a Thursday night. You know, you had a spat on a Thursday night, you start processing it Friday night, takes the whole weekend of, you know, by the time people are feeling friendly again, it's Sunday night, well, Sunday night, I mean, nobody is going to have sex on a Sunday night, right? And it's Monday again, and then it's a whole week. So if you have conflict, let, let's make the numbers easy. If you have a little spat on Monday, Janu-- June 1st, you have a spat Monday on June 1st, it kind of people are a little cold and kind of bitchy, you know, during the course of the week, they don't see each other that much, they are busy and how many times I have to tell you, you know, put the cap back on the toothpaste and, you know, that is the weekend and then, they finally talk about, you know, okay, so what's bothering you? You know, you've been cold to me all week, what's the matter? You're-- you really want to know what's the matter? Yeah, I really want. Do you really know what's the matter? Yeah, what's the matter? Okay. If you really want, yeah, I really want to know. All right, then I'll tell you. Then it takes a whole weekend to get over that and then it's Monday again and nobody has sex from Monday to Friday. So if you have, if you have a conflict on Monday, June 1st, you might not have sex again until Friday, June, ah,10th or whatever it is. So a little bit of conflict can go a long way to prevent sex. And, in fact, if you have a conflict on Monday June 1st, and then you finally, get around to having sex on June 10th, except that on June 10th my sister is visiting from Milwaukee. Oh, well, there goes sex for the weekend, then it's another whole week before we have sex. Now, three weeks that we haven't had sex and you know what, wouldn't you know it, the day before the weekend, three weeks later, you put a dent in my bike, I can't believe it. My bike is where it always is, you pulled your car and you were in such a big hurry, you put a dent on my bike, thanks a whole lot. You know, like I needed one more project, right? Sex, I don't think so. And you wake up and it's three months later and you haven't had sex. That's what real life is like for people. So this idea, you know, that, ah, you know, we, we should help people get to a place where they are having sex twice a week, you know, for a lot of grownups, it's just not practical. And we need to understand that I think. Another reason that couples don't enjoy sex is the lack of infrastructure, infrastructure, we know what that means, roads and dams, right? So they don't have enough road and dams. Oh, wait. What does that mean about sex? They don't have the vocabulary they need, they don't have a comfortable way of saying, uhm, you know, I'm really not comfortable with that brand of condoms, you know, it's so hard to tear open the package. They are not, uhm, comfortable with, you know, I really don't like oral sex when you haven't shave because your face is so scratchy against my thighs. People need vocabulary and not just vocabu-- but it sets a permission like, is it really okay to say, honey, it's okay when you go down on me, but that scratchy face against my silken white thighs, you know, or my silken black thighs, my silken, you know, soft curvy flesh, wait, what are we talking about, uhm? We got to be able to talk about this. You want to help people with their sex lives, we got to be able to talk about your scratchy beard against my thighs. I mean, I'm not wild about you're going down on me in the first place but I know you like it and when I'm in the right mood, you know, it's okay. Sometimes, I even come from that and not always but you know, sometimes, especially if you're not pushing me. But you know, if you're not going to shave and then you're going to scratch me down there, you know, what, you know. Let's just like do it the regular way and be done with it, right? So we need to be able to talk about that. We need to be able to talk about that. And of course, ah, power struggles, very common, very common. Power struggles where people try and push each other to do stuff they don't want to do, all the other guys do this, what's wrong with you? Very common, all the other guys do this, what's wrong with you, very common. Or, uhm, power struggles about well, I like to do it in the morning, she likes to do it at night, as a result we can't agree on when to have sex, we haven't sex in three years. You ever get one of those, I get those all the time. I ask those people, what do you do on a Saturday night when you want Chinese food and you want Italian food? Now, some couples their answer to that is, oh, don't ask about that. We haven't been able to go out to dinner on Saturday night in years. And so I tell them the truth, I say, if you can't figure out how to, you know, how to pick a restaurant on a Saturday night, I'm not surprised that you can't figure out how to have sex if you like it in the morning and you like it at night. On the other hand, oh, this is how we do that, and different couples do it in a different way. Some couples do with, uhm, I make the money so I, I make the choice. Some couples do it with well, I have a back problem so we only got to place with comfortable chairs. Some couples do it with, uhm, you picked the restaurant last week, so I get to pick it this week. Some couples do it with well, it depends on how much money we feel we have this week. Some couples do it with, well, do we have a long time because we have a really great babysitter or we just sort of sneak in out for a quickie. So different couples may handle that restaurant thing differently, but successfully in which guy they say, well, how was it that you don't use the same good negotiating skills that you use successfully around restaurants that you don't do that with sex. Tell me how it's different. So we want to notice if there were power struggles and, and let me say this about power and routine. We mostly think of routine and sex as a bad thing, like oh, you know, we're in a rot-- sexually, people in a routine and routine is bad and all that. There is one way in which routine is crucial for enjoyable sex. Yes, routine has a good side to it and here's what I mean. Nobody does everything in bed, nobody does like 12,000 different positions in bed. You know, what happens is, people start their sexual careers at some point and they do, you know, oh, they do this, they do this, they do this, you know, everybody has sex on the beach once and then they say, "Well, that's not-- no, I'll never going to do it again."

MARTY KLEIN A lot of people have sex in the shower once.

MARTY KLEIN So people try a lot of stuff and then you get together with somebody else, you know, and you've got your bunch of favorite stuff and they got their bunch of favorite stuff and some of those things overlapped and some of them don't and typically, your favorite stuff and their favorite stuff where the two things overlapped that tends to be the stuff that you do. And then, you know, maybe for somebody's birthday, you played a pirate game or whatever it is. Uhm, but there is, I just, I just make that up, I-- you know, the pirate game, "Rrrr! Let's have sex." If I, if I ever, if I ever speak to a group of pirates, I'm in a big trouble. But see, the thing is I never speak to pirates. Pittsburgh, notwithstanding. So, so-- but here is the thing about sexual routine, here's the thing about sexual routine, you got to have a sexual routine because you don't want to have to negotiate everything from scratch everytime you have sex. So, for example, you do this, you do that, you know, when you-- and you discover that, oh, the such and such position, that's something that you really don't enjoy because it hurts your back, that's something that you don't enjoy because it's itchy or you, you know, such and such position, that's something that you used to do but you just sort of used that all up or whatever it is. So we don't do the such and such position anymore and-- or you know, sometimes there's, ah, oh, would it be great if we did so and so and you've already said listen, I hate so and so. I'd rather pull up my own chief, I hate so and so I hate it before I met you, I don't want to do it with you, if you die, I'm not going to do with the next person, I just don't like so and so. Now, the, the grown up response to that, the grown up response to that is, oh, what I hear you saying is, you don't want to do so and so with me, well, as long as there is some other things that we do together sexually that we both enjoy, ah! No problem. But wouldn't you know it, human beings being the way they are the more typical response to that is either "Oh, so and so, that's my favorite thing. Oh no, oh," that's one common response. The other common response is, "Oh, ah, you just you're just having had so and so the right way. Oh, listen, oh we-- we're going to use yogurt when we do so and so." So but, but, but the, but the serious points here is that, this person doesn't want to deal with the question of let's do so and so every time they have sex, right? What this person wants is, let's just agree that we're never gonna do so and so let's move on. Right? It's like as it happens I don't like sushi, you know. So if, if you and I are married, you know, you're gonna ask me the first three times we go out to dinner, let's have sushi and I'm going to say, you know, it's not just tonight, I mean, I'm not going to like sushi until the end of time. So let's just agree, you want to have sushi, I'm not gonna have sushi. Uhm, we don't, we don't want a key having to talk about it. With sex, people need some agreements, these are the things that were, were-- are eligible to do. These are the things that we've agreed we're not gonna do. Here is things in the middle that maybe we'll do, maybe we won't. But here's the routine that we can both expect from which to chose, not that we're gonna do the exact same thing every time. But here's the eligible basket and the eligible basket doesn't include so and so. We get people coming in and one of the reasons they don't have sex and they won't tell you unless you ask, one of the reasons they don't have sex or one of the reason that sex is not appealing to one person or the other or both, is because they still haven't agreed we're never gonna do so and so. We're never gonna do so and so and so every time they have sex, it's like come on, no I don't want to. Oh come on, come on, come on. I told you a hundred million times I don't want to do it. Well, all the other people do what's wrong with you. I told you I don't want to do it. Well, what about just this once, I told you I don't want to. I mean, it's even boring to listen to, right? So you want to find out, you want to find out about those repetitive, those repetitive struggles. We still got 15 minutes, right? No? We have five minutes? No. Yes. Okay. So as I have already indicated many times, as I've indicated many times, ask patients what they mean. Under these every second of those five minutes, so relax. Ask patients what they mean, whatever words they used and I don't mean scented rose garden, I mean, when people talk about I'm this kind of a person, ask them what they mean experientially. When people talk about he is too kinky, what do you mean by kinky? Now, everybody has an intuitive sense of what kinky means but what do you mean by kinky? What do you mean by kinky? Cuz some people mean it as a criticism, other people mean it as a, an exclamation of pleasure. What does it mean arousal? What does it mean desire? These common words that everybody uses what does this actual specific couple mean? We want to know what they mean, premature ejaculation, another expression I don't use, it will be no surprise at this point when I say, premature-- by the way, where is that clipboard that we were passing around? Did they end up anywhere? 

01:47:20
 Here. 

01:47:20
MARTY KLEIN Yes, perfect. There's another one, where-- great. Thank you. When people, when people say premature ejaculation, I say, oh, you come, you come before you want to. And it's the before you want to part, that's the important thing cuz maybe your expectations about how long you're suppose to last are unrealistic. When Masters and Johnson came up with their, ah, ah, definition of premature ejaculation back in the mid '60s, it was a guy who cannot last long enough for his female partner to come from penis-vagina intercourse at least 50% of the time. There's about nine different things wrong with that, with that definition. So ask people what they mean, ask people what they mean. Let me, ah, mention the concept of sexual intelligence, just so happens to be the title of my new book which is Peter Pearson would tell you is for sale in the bookstore downstairs. Sexual intelligence, it's a combination of information and skills and body awareness. We need to assess that people have the raw data that they need like do you know what a clitoris is cuz not everybody does and people need skills, people need to be able to touch and to notice how somebody feels when they are touching them. And people need a sense of where their own body is in space. Some people kind of clumsy, some people just don't pay that much attention. One of the problems with all of the cellphone use and the texting and the this and that with a synchronous communication, a synchronous communication, people are attending only to words because the other person isn't there, they are not looking in each other's faces when they communicate like in the good old days. And so, people are you know, not developing the skill of actually reading body language. Gee, you look further relax while Im saying this, gee, you look uptight when I was-- so that's one of the problems with a synchronous communication. So, uhm, whether it's religious beliefs, whether it's this is what's feminists, whether if this is a real man, whether its any belief cultural, whether this is the way we Irish people are, you know, I have a hot Irish temper, I have a hot Italian temper, I have a hot Canadian temper, you know, whatever people's beliefs are, we, we get to say to people you're free to make your own choices, beliefs are choices, beliefs are choices. And you're free to make your own choices but you are not free to say, I don't have to take responsibility for my choices and you're not even free in this therapy, you're not even free to say, oh, I make choices and I don't realize it at the time and I can't be held accountable because after all that's what my church tells me to do. If you want to do it your church tells, tells you to do or your mother tells you what to do, or your men's bowling team tells you what to do, it's a free country as long as there is no coercion you can do what you like. But you have to acknowledge that these are choices and that your choices have consequences. So let me end with, ah, believe it or not one more cartoon, Henry, show the Robertsons, that funny face you always make when you climax. Now, that is sexual communication, that is sexual intelligence. I'm going to be around all weekend, feel free to send me an email.
