DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER 

00:00:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Our next speaker is very unusual and wonderful persons to have here. His name is Ralph Nafo-- Savarese. Uhm, he's a professor of contemporary literature at Cornell College at Iowa, uhm, for starters. And he adapted an autistic who is very traumatize. And this is one case, ah, we have seen so often in our field that people who are not strange in our field make some of the greatest contributions, uhm, uncontaminated by (inaudible ) teaching so we give the people in our graduate schools. Uhm, and so he started to work with his child and became very curious about it. He's write a number-- written number of books about it. Ah, this last year he go to fellowship, ah, in, in Neurohumanities at Duke University at their - 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Institute for Brain Sciences. 

00:01:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK - Institute for Brain Sciences, ah, where Joseph Spinazzola who is the executive director of the Trauma Center. And he said, "You should listen to this guy because he has really been exploring with his own child and it's often happen in the, in this field that so many people who make the greatest contributions are the people who have kids of their own who suffer from this stuff and then they have no choice or people themselves have to do it from self. No choice but to really to find this was. And so he was very eager to talk with us about his explanations to autism, uhm, and deva-- and, ah, perceptual causes in autism and how it might apply to the trauma field, I'm delighted to have him here. Thank you.

Ralph Savarese, Ph. D. Creative Writer post 

00:01:55
RALPH SAVARESE So, ah, I, I first wanna thank Bessel and Joe for inviting me. Hi, Joe. Uhm, it's a real honor I've learned in an enormous amount, in 3 days I feel like I've got, ah, somehow give this talk and stop the, the processing of everything I've heard but I'm gonna do, ah, do my best here. What I really do is, is take up something to Dr. Mafar-- McFarlane said this morning and talking what he said he talk about the disruption of the frontal lobe. And I wanna think about, uhm, what kind of analogy might be possible between autism and PTSD. And, and specifically trying coax a therapeutic linguistic function out of, uhm, out of both. But first let me tell you heard a little bit more about who I am. You heard a little bit, ah, ah, I'm a creative writer, don't get scared, ah, pet, SCS memories translator, I'm also disability study, study scholar and really probably last 10 years most of my publications have been in that field with specialty in classical autism, I'm a proponent of neurodiversity which is the idea that departures from the neurological norm need not be exclusively pathalo-- pathologize so that there might be ways of, of using a different kind of brain to do things in a different way. And so much of what we've heard about autism. Well, let me use the world wrong, is wrong, uhm. I'm also literature scholar with, ah, as you heard with the special team cognitive approaches to literature so I, I spend a year investigating what's happening when we read novels or poems or re-- or say them out loud. Uhm, and I'm also a fost-- a former foster parent. Uhm, 15 years ago my wife and I adapted a non-speaking 6-year-old boy with autism at the time he was in diapers and said to profoundly retarded. He had been terribly abuse by his birth mother and then again, in foster care. After adapting DJ we painstakingly thought him how to read, to point and to type on a computer. In the 6th grade he remark to a teacher about his early years. Hard getting smart because on the very intense real treacherous not humane circumstances. Uhm, so, in 2007, with his permission I published the book about him, he wrote the last chapter. He told me that he said, when we really talked about this cuz it was a big deal wa-- where really gonna go public as a family. 

00:04:20
REASONABLE PEOPLE 

00:04:25
RALPH SAVARESE He said, "Dad, kids need our help." So, uhm, in-- and he wrote the last chapter and in that chapter he took me to task for how I represented her birth mother. My liberal politics about poor women on welfare conflicted with his personal experience of horror. You're too nice to your dad, I had a great fear of her dunking me each day in the water for long times without letting me breathe in our apartment she treated me like an animal. DJ is referring to how his birth mother fleered with killing him in the bathtub. Ah, the chapter also references his physical and sexual abuse in foster care at the hands of a much older boy who had himself been sexually abuse by his father. They put DJ in a room with this young man who is so cle-- who clearly had this history, it's unbelievable what happens in foster care. Now the sense of powerlessness that trauma typically instills was exacerbated in DJ's case by an inability to speak or even the gesture that what was happening to him. He live, still lives inside of a body that makes all manner of physical activity difficult. As he reports in reasonable people he use to plead with his arms and fingers. When I live in fear I yearned urge just one especially humane free gesture to tell someone just hear me I really need help. Two years ago, despite continuing difficulty with PTSD still doesn't talk he uses a text to voice sensitizer DJ graduate from Cornell High School in Iowa with highest honors.

RALPH SAVARESE When applying to college he took the ACTs by pointing independently a blown up answer banks. Because they're significant motor impairment in classical autism, he needed sufficient space between the A, B, C and D to unambiguously signal his choices. He got three times the amount of time but he spend two-thirds of that time running around the room screaming at the top of his lungs cuz he knew this was the gateway. We'd spend a year negotiating with the ACTs to get this accommodation and he had it a scribe with him he was not familiar which was a big, big part of his stress who would write down his answers. He'd-- it went through at once and then the second time they ask him whether he was sure, ah, about, about, he-- what he had chosen. He has the distinction of being the first non-speaking autist to be admitted to a highly selective college and to live with an aid in the dorms. He just completed his first year. Ah, and, and it's amazing, it's been, it's been really, really stressful, holy moly. Ah, holy moly, the, the first, ah, week in orientation week involves, ah, workshops about date, rate and with almost no regard for the young men and women they've just admitted who have had this kind of past and it trigger just massive stuff early on with, ah, oh, my God, really progressive school, really damn first move. And now my-- I've got PTSD cuz I'm like, "Ah, how am I gonna do this?" As a way of learning how to insist on his self-worth and to improve the lives of other people with autism he has devoted himself to the concept of neurodiversity appearing in a CNN documentary about the neurodiversity movement. I can see him there. When Dr. Sanjay Gupta ask DJ if autism which many people consider a devastating disorder should be treated, he typed, "Yes, treated with respect." And his dad, you know, this, ah, way too educated guy was using the most convoluted sentences none of which could be used in the documentary. D-- DJ knew he need to sound by to get people's, ah, attention. Uhm, this past March he won a very, very large grant from independent television services the programing arm of PBS for documentary he's been making with the maker about his improbable journey. DJ is the project star, writer and co-producer, it will the first mainstream documentary in which an autist has control over how autism is represented. A good part of the film deals with his persistent struggles with PTSD that, you know, looping spiral that you determine has talked about you never really done with it. I present these personal details so that you understand my connection to the disorder, I'm not an expert though I've been a primary care giver for someone with the condition. One thing my wife and I both notice when DJ came to live with us was that autism seem to act as a kind PTSD accelerate with respect to its preservative aspects and as important it sensory aspects. Autist Donna Williams authors, author of the best sellers Nobody Nowhere and Somebody Somewhere has said that people with autism live in the sensory. She's even describe their processing as a difficulty interpreting beyond the sensory. To get an idea of what Williams means by living in the sensory consider this account by Carly Fleischmann a non-speaking person with autism typing independently on an iPad, Carly described her difficulty listening to a conversation partner in a coffee shop. 

00:10:10
"The woman who brushes a long our table leaves an overpowering scent of perfume and my focus moves. Then the conversation over my left shoulder from the table behind me comes into play. The rough side of my left sleeve cuff rubs up and down on my body. That starts to get my attention as the whoosh and whistle of the coffee maker blends into different sounds all around me. The visual of the door opening and shutting in the front of the store completely consumes me. I have lost the conversation, missing most of what the person in front of me is talking about.... I find myself only hearing the odd word" (Carly's Voice ) 

00:10:15
RALPH SAVARESE The woman who brushes a long our table leaves an overpowering scent of perfume and my focus moves. Then the conversation over my left shoulder from the table behind me comes into play. The rough side of my left sleeve cuff rubs up and down on my body. That starts to get my attention as the whoosh and whistle of the coffee maker blends into different sounds all around me. The visual of the door opening and shutting in the front of the store completely consumes me. I have lost the conversation, missing most of what the person in front of me is talking about. I find myself only hearing the odd word. The difficulty interpreting beyond the sensory is both an issue of intentional focus. Autistics have trouble privileging certain kinds of stimuli such as speech, speech sounds and filtering out others but also of conceptual mastery of what is attended to. As an example by Tito Mukhopadhyay we'll make clear. Ah, I, I, I should-- ah, okay. Here, here this is a photo of Tito and me. The author of four books and the subject of 60 Minutes profile Tito is probably the world's most well-known non-speaking person with autism. Because he has never been allowed in a regular school I been tutoring him for a good many of years. This past year while I was at Duke Tito and I read Moby Dick together by Skype and he would use this sidebar to type his responses and we-- we've got we're-- ah, we've got a long essay that were publishing together, uhm, about trying to disprove all of these, ah, myths about lack of creativity and, and so forth. In this passage from his third book Tito is being tested by a prominent neurologist who doubts that the severely autistic can understand language. Instructed to listen to something being read allowed by an aid Tito finds himself focusing on the sound of what the man says not the meaning of his words. Claude read, "I saw the voice transform into long apple green and yellow strings searching under the table for who knows what." Treads like raw silk forming, from Claude's voice. Claude read, " I watch those strings vibrate with different amplitudes as Claude tried to impress the silent beholders and serious researchers of autism with the bearing tones of a near to perfection performance." Claude read, "I watch those strings with stresses and strains reaching their own elastic limits and snapping every now and then. When his voice reach the certain pitch I saw those snap strings from knots like in tangled silk the color of apple green and yellow." When a neurologist ask so what was he reading, Tito response with the sentence about the beauty of the color green when yellow sunshine melts its way through newly grown leaves. Not what you want to say to skeptical neurologist. The neurologist interprets Tito's answer as a failure to comprehend what was read to him not as a lucid and indeed artful description of the voices alternative registration. I should point out that Tito like many autistic is anesthetic his anesthesia is been confirm by neuroimaging for months he practice line still in a cardboard tube so that researchers might get some semi-decent scans and he's really the only, only person I-- ah, the only scans we have of a classical autist awake do it-- doing things. So when you hear about neuro-- you know, neuroimaging and autism it's not this group that I, that I work with. Uhm, autistics apparently have access to what the cognitive literally scholar Reuven Tsur calls pre-categorical sensory information. In this case the stream of sounds that non-autistics almost instantaneously convert into re-- into, ah, recognizable phone names. Tsur has argue that rhyme, rhythm and a literation not only preserve but also shape a portion of this otherwise unheard auditory stream and thereby enrich our static experience of a poem. I get a little carried away with images.

"Perch on their water-perch hung in the clear Bann River Near the clay bank in alder-dapple and waver, Perch we called 'grunts', little flood-slubs, runty and ready..." (Electric Light, 2001). 

00:14:25
RALPH SAVARESE Ah, when the Irish poet and novel Laureate Seamus Heaney rights of a particular species of fish. "Perch on their water-perch hung in the clear Bann River near the clay bank in alder-dapple and waver, perch we called grunts, little flood-slubs, runty and ready". What pleases the readers less that perch have been skillfully describe and that they have been palpably devote. The poem's acoustical effects which know of themselves mean nothing. Standing for the dynamism of what is been perceived indeed for the dynamism a perception itself. But capturing pre-categorical sensory information the poet brings the life into mire semantic or conceptual understanding. He offers us to feel of experience. I will say more about this later for now let stipulate-- I told I got carried away. In poetry, ah, language behaves less like a dutiful mule than a rearing circus horse. Something to behold as much as to unpack or decode, put more prosaically it cannot be reduce to what it means, it's not semantic elements make a significant claim on the sensing body. It's the French philosopher Michel Serres has written, "The writer who merely goes for meaning does nothing but calculate. He can only be said to write when the all the senses tremble within the flesh of language, semi-soft, a double variety for sight, touch, smell and taste. A study from 2008, confirm that autistic exhibits superior perceptual processing of speech relative to controls. I mean they actually hear speech sounds more precisely and robustly than neurotypicals but in inferior semantic processing. I mean they do not interpret those sounds as well symbolically which those take convert. The study also found that for autistic semantic level processing is not the primary or default speech processing mode. Or they really haven't done that with this group to see before and after, after you teach them, ah, language we-- whether there's a change there. Uhm, let me see. The authors hypothesize that with non-autistics increase the tension to content information result to the poor perceptual then comprehension performance. So, autistics better to perceptual, were much better semantics, and what is trauma do? Just keep that in the back of your mind. In other words typical language users don't fully listen to what they hear, they convert the auditory stream into something useful.

B IS FOR BAD PEOTRY My Book of REALLY BAD poems It was Orange as always when I heard the wind. Orange it is - the sound of the wind in spring. It made the branches swing. It colored every little thing. It smelled of orange that - sound of wind in spring. Orange it is - as always the sudden wind. It kept getting wilder - it's orange on everything. (I'm Not a Poet But I Write Poetry, 2013) 

00:17:10
RALPH SAVARESE This is, uhm, one of my favorite images. Ah, this may import explain why teaching non-autistics to write poetry is generally so difficult, where two plugged into meaning. On the other hand autistics are too plunged in to perceptual pattern, while poetry obviously needs both, pattern essential to the art form and the pattern musically subordinates ordinary linguistic function. As this poem entitle Orange by Tito makes clear. And I'm gonna use Tito going forward because all of the work that you'll see up here has been published, it's out the public domain so there's no-- and, you know, we do this a lot together. Called "Orange", "It was Orange as always when I heard the wind. Orange it is the sound of the wind in spring. It made the branches swing. It colored every little thing. It smelled of orange that sound of wind in spring. Orange it is, as always the sudden wind. It kept getting wilder, it's orange on everything." Here the pattern is sistina(ph) like the end words repeat in a kind of sensory merry go round but the pattern can also be more conventional within our locking rhymes in a opera. My school is that open dream. My words find hard to say, my school is doubt in your eyes and my withdrawing away. My school is the summer dust screen I saw coming through my window trying to find a way to my room then disappearing and then obscure shadow. Here Tito was responding to an interviewer's question about his education when he suddenly broke and diverse. And those who read Moby Dick know that at one-- at some point Ishmael talks about a wheel ship being his Yale car-- ah, Yale College and his Harvard. And so he really cathected with this idea of having to get an education in a alternative, alternative way. The instrumental use of language depends on ignoring at least to a degree the sensuous materiality and non-semantic patterning of the signifiers. In poetry something much more holistic and dynamic happens and this differences if the analogy I propose between autism and PTSD is it all valued maybe of relevance to clinicians. To be clear, I'm not suggesting the trauma give someone autism rather I'm suggest that trauma larges at the pre- categorical level, the level of the sensory. It violently freeze perceptual input from conceptual understanding or mastering. To the degree that people with PTSD cannot mobilize the executive and symbolizing capacities that prefrontal cortex to tame this input and to the degree that they follow its dictates. They can be said to resemble autistics who have not yet found a way to interpret beyond the sensory or who having found a way still sometimes get lost in it. Bessel, once memorably complained that psychology and psychiatrist disciplines have paid scant attention to the deficient orientation and action patterns that are triggered by sensory input, instead to the narrowly focus on either neurochemistry were emotion states. This by the way is also true of autism. Noting PTSD's effect on the brain expressive language center best or remark in a book chapter. It is important to help people with PTSD find a language in which they come to understand and communicate their experiences. It is possible that some of the newer body or in a therapist, I mean you'll benefits a traditional verbally based therapies may lack because they do not require the victim be able to verbally communicate to details of his or her experience and we've seen that all conference, right? O-- all of these alternative ways of getting at, at, uhm, at the problem of PTSD. And in an interview, ah, he gave in 2004, he was even more forceful about the fundamental short coming of verbal therapies. Fundamentally words can't disintegrate the disorganize sensations and actual patterns that form the core imprint of trauma. To do effective therapy we need to do things that change the way people regulate these core functions which probably can't be done by words and language alone. I agree but with poetry such as start to economy may not hold. Indeed it's in a especially in bodied form of language poetry may constitute a kind of yoga call it, "Word yoga", and it may provide a bridge from the perceptual to the cognitive, especially if you're really trying to coax therapeutic linguistic function from folks who were stock at the perceptual level what kind of language is gonna work? Uhm, this is been my experience working with classical autistics whose I've said often find it difficult to interpret, ah, beyond the sensory. Okay. What I'm imagining for people with PTSD into and extent with some clinicians are already doing is a kind of therapy in which a flashback like art form offers practice and linguistically organizing affect laden sensory perceptions and integrating them with higher order of thinking. But doing so through pattern, not through preposition. By flashback like art form I mean that poetry fragmented in linguistic and emotional character along with his pre-categorical sensory information vaguely mimic the delivery system of PTSD but with a crucial difference. Here the idea would be less to narrativize disturbing memories to a process of demystification or abstraction than to exploit poetry's ability to reset the body and even to engender self-expression. A study from 2010 entitled "Recon Mission", familiarizing veterans with their change emotional landscape through poetry gets impart of what I'm envisioning. In this study the therapist did not address the participant's traumatic memorize rather she use poetry to help them regulate their feelings. She chose poems about veterans though not poems about comeback as the author come in it. Poems that were darker hopeless were avoided as the whole point of the mission was not to go in the past but to focus in the hearing now. She also deployed military terminology as a kind of metaphorical frame for the writing exercises praises such as Recon Mission, captured moment, army of emotions, operation salvage etcetera. To support her approach she appeal to the research on expressive writing generally and on poetry therapy specifically. But the focus of the therapy was largely content based. It did not conceive of the benefit of poetry in perceptual terms. Even the use of military metaphors as understood simply as a way of making the active reading and writing poetry more familiar to veterans, not as an opportunity to rescript the past implicitly on the level of the body. If metaphor comprehension as we will see requires unwilling participatory simulation in areas of the brain other than our traditional language centers then metaphor like poetry itself is not nearly a matter of meaning. I will elaborate on the idea of word yoga and share with the neuroscience of literally, reading and writing as began to reveal and support of it. But first let me say a bit more about the sensory in autism. And I gives you good picture. Tito, has had to teach himself not to respond to spoke in language perceptually. But when anxiety is high ordinary comprehension prove exceedingly difficult. As in PTSD the right hemisphere mix of less mediated sensory input and strong emotion threatens to swamp rational control. Well, Tito renders the failure of linguistic understanding in a whimsical passion where delights in his orange universe living in the sensory can be quite challenging for autistics and sometimes even unbearable. As Temple Grandin as reported auditory and tactile input often overwhelm me loud noises hurt my ears when noise and sensory stimulation became too intense I was able to shut off my hearing and retreat into my own world. In the following passage by Tito, the sensory's negative hold is unmistakable. Tito, is listening to a news report about a coal mining disaster. The words that he hears and elaborate synesthetic response that takes over his body to the point that he's force to retreat and semantic understanding once again completely fails. And, and look how well this young man writes, uhm, I'm jealous of him.

"I see these stories, sometimes in vermillion or indigo, the richness depending upon the intensity of the stories. Sometimes they smell like vitriol and sometimes they smell like boiling starch in a pot of clay. And sometimes they have the essence of the twilight sky. As I feel my worries for the trapped coal miners, I can smell the boiling starch, frothing on the brim of the clay pot, then spilling out with the smell of burning rice. My worries grow as the voice of the newsreader continues to say that the miners are still trapped. I smell burning rice spread across the room as more starch spills out... My body begins to itch as though tiny black tickle ants have been set free from a box. They can smell the burning rice from the spilling starch, and they rush around to find the source with a collective ant hunger. My worry now accumulates in and across my itching skin, as the voice of the newsreader comes from far away, like a blue floating balloon. I have no hold on it because it floats away, leaving me with itchy skin." (Mukhopadhyay, 2008).

RALPH SAVARESE I see these stories, sometimes in vermillion or indigo, the richness depending upon the intensity of the stories. Sometimes they smell like vitriol and sometimes they smell like boiling starch in a pot of clay. And sometimes they have the essence of the twilight sky. As I feel my worries for the trapped coal miners, I can smell the boiling starch, frothing on the brim of the clay pot, then spilling out with the smell of burning rice. My worries grow as the voice of the newsreader continues to say that the miners are still trapped. I smell burning rice spread across the room as more starch spills out. My body begins to itch as though tiny black tickle ants have been set free from a box. They can smell the burning rice from the spilling starch, and they rush around to find the source with a collective ant hunger. My worry now accumulates in and across my itching skin, as the voice of the newsreader comes from far away, like a blue floating balloon. I have no hold on it because it floats away, leaving me with itchy skin." I would propose that the volatile escalation of the sensory and emotion is roughly, very roughly like into a flashback. At least in, in how would it operates. Of course, what Tito presents is not a flashback, it's a linguistic account after the fact yet one that preserve certain characteristics of a flashback. At first, you'll see the auditory stimuli register as a visual and then as an old factory tableau. Interestingly, Tito must resort to analogy in order to evoke the events unfolding. Once he has the boiling starch in the related smell of burning rice his frost palm can begin to move. The addition of the ants another analogical entity allows him to connect the starch to his itchy skin. It is as if he were crossing a cognitive creek, stone by an assisted stone, call it narrative by other means. A final analogy the blue floating balloon, conveys the breakdown of ordinary consciousness including the loss of receptive language skills. All of these is conveyed with as strange and beautiful calm, a calm that belies the actual melt down terrific melt down the accompanied the experience. Something like association is paradoxically found, ah, out language here thinking and feeling have been put back together. The sensory integrated is our as a particularly detailed word picture. What interest me most and what maybe relevant to PTSD is that Tito appears to relay an atypical processing proclivities to write like this. These processing proclivities can get them into sensory trouble and can make constructing a linear narrative difficult but they can also allow word yoga to do its work. Ah, a recent meta-analysis by Laurent Mottron's team at the University of Montreal found that autistics have been comparatively more activity in the temporal, occipital and parental regions and less activity in the frontal cortex to non-autistics. There is also a shift in processing toward the right cerebral hemisphere. The authors concluded a stronger engagement of sensus-- sensory processing mechanisms may facilitate an atypically prominent role for perceptual mechanism in supporting cognition. And you can see this can be a negative in some ways and it potentially could be a positive and that's where, where, ah, something like poetry comes in. Uhm, the results confirm with Temple Grandin and it's been saying for years that autistic think in pictures. In the 6 grade my son put this memorably, "Autism sucks but I see things you don't see." He's got a very peavy sense of how to capture your attention. A number of studies reference by the men analysis note in particular unusual realize on visuospatial resources in autism. This is true of working memory tasks involving letters and even comprehension tasks involving sentences. A study from 2006 comparing how autistics and non-autistics process high and low imagery sentences found that the former activated parietal and occipital region for both kinds of sentences where is the ladder did so only for the high imagery once. An example of a high image with sentence, DJ love this image. To its objects were ask to respond true or false the number eight when rotated 90° looks like a pair of glasses. And when processing this particular form of language autistics look a lot more like neurotypicals cuz we start recruiting other regions besides her traditional language centers. For not autistics neuro imaging data support a greater involvement of sensory areas in concrete world processing and a more focal activation of per-- perisylvian language areas for function words as well as abstract nouns. This distinction may impart underlie the pleasure and indeed the power of literature especially poetry which by largely stewing abstract diction encourages us to produce metal imagery. As the cognitive literally critic Brian Richardson is argued leaning of the work lane scary. "The great sensory endow their visual images with the vivacity of life perception. Readers mentally produce images under the instruction of the writer. And you argue that in trauma people are producing images under the instruction of the past and, and, and maybe, maybe you can intervene, uhm, there. According to the 2006 study the autistics however, produce mental imagery even when face with verbal obstruction. This processing difference which the study's authors interpreted as a sign of under connectivity may explain the recourse to concrete sense space words and figures of speech in autistic writing. Less able to manage obstruction in the traditional manner autistics says Olga Bogdashina "May develop a highly poetic language full of beautiful metaphors and similes." Should we be surprise that metaphor processing also involve sensory areas in the brain? In a study from 2012 sentences contain textural metaphors, I had a rough day activated the texture selective some out a sensory cortex where is literal sentences match for meaning, "I had a bad day", did not. 

00:33:15
"may develop a highly poetic Language, full of beautiful similes." (Communication Insaves in Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Do We Speak the Same Language 2004) 

00:33:15
RALPH SAVARESE The study purports to confirm a sensual premise of conceptual metaphor theory that knowledge structured around metaphor comeuppance derive from physical experience. In this theory the verbally abstract emerges from the verbally concrete over time, as Julian James once explain, "Abstract words are ancient coins whose concrete images and the bus give and take of talk have warn away with use." In accordance with the current theory that novel metaphors as supposed to cliché disproportionately activate areas of the right hemisphere. The authors are now investigating with the novel textural metaphors. I had a rough day as a cliché, right? Disproportionately activate the texture selective somata sensory cortex. A study from 2010 found this to be exactly the case with action metaphors. For example, "John, grasp the idea", the author's write. The involvement of sensory motor systems changes through a gradual obstruction process whereby relatively detailed simulations are used for understanding unfamiliar metaphors and these simulations become less detailed and involve only secondary motor regions as familiarity increases. This is, ah,-- here's a another image that DJ really like. I'm probably belaboring the obvious but the kind of language we give autistics and the kind of language we expect them to produce matters at least at the beginning of their communicative journey. To extend the aformen-- aforementioned metaphor by James where is literate neurotypical filled their pockets with ancient coins. In one study only 16% of the nouns and adult speech could be classified as concrete. Autistic seem to crave freshly minted currency. It is as if to participate in the economy of language this group needs like the blind to identify value with their fingers, where's my son once described it, "To touch the words." This group needs ensured in especially embodied form of language. A form of language more sympathetic to their processing strengths. My people with PTSD need this as well. Visuospatial resources of course play significant role in the disorder as at 2009, study plainly states-- oh, it's stuck. Opp! I'm gonna go back. Trauma flashbacks are sensory perceptual visuospatial metal images. Study from 2003, that Dr. McFarlane participated and found that people with PTSD depend on visuospatial coding for working memory representations of trauma neutral, trauma neutral verbal information. When required the update working memory subjects did not bilaterally activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Group differences in the relative involvement of the DLPFC the authors argued indicate less dependence in PTSD on the executive role normally attributed to the left (inaudible ) PFC from monitoring and manipulation of working memory content and posterior regions of the brain. A 2005, study of working memory in autism yielded very similar results. A 2008, study of subjects with severe PTSD confirm the 2003, ah, study's findings. It show that during visuo-verval task requiring either maintenance or continual updating of word stimuli such subjects remind in updating or visuospatial mode. This propensity is been link to hyper arousal and reactivity. And that should be an image there. Now I am definitely out of my depth here and making a hugely but might be study suggest the need to adapt the kind of language that is deployed and cultivated in a therapeutic setting for PTSD patients. Might the language need to be more suited to a right hemisphere driven visuospatial intelligence one in which has Newton's(ph) team set of autism a stronger engagement of sensory processing mechanisms may facilitate and atypically prominent role for perceptual mechanisms in supporting cognition. What I wanna do in the time that remains is to identify other aspects of word yoga and to hypothesize about their potential value to PTSD. As a number of researchers have shown in PTSD relatively under activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inhibits the ability to make temporal distinctions and to generate sequences. Interestingly, when he was a child Tito had great trouble with both. I've see-- and I've seen this problem again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again with classical autistics. Here is Portia Iversen's account of a conversation with Tito's mother Soma about his difficulties with time. 

00:38:15
RALPH SAVARESE e did not experience time the way most people did. She explained, he was anxious all the time because he could not anticipate what was next. When she told them anything having to do with future events is anxiety redoubled because he could not tolerate the thought of getting from the present moment to a designated time in the future. He'd absolutely no ability to wait for anything and it seem that in this respect in spite of his otherwise, well developed intellect Tito was developmentally morel like a toddler. Tito could not anticipate, he could not wait, he could not please himself, he did not know how to live in the measured flow of time to find by predictable events and expectations the way most people can. This cause them untold anxiety and time pure raw uncontrollable fear and rage.

"Moment slip from the arms of the clock, Spilling time beyond my reach" (How Can I talk..., 2008) 

00:39:00
RALPH SAVARESE And yet the young man who wrote moment slip from the arms of the clock spilling time beyond my reach, eventually learn to manage dis concept though I'm remember the fact that its frost books behave more like poems and essays or narrative. They do not move in linear fashion, even now is accomplish author Tito regularly breaks in diverse in the midst of them. In a publish inter, interview with me he explain the hobbit this way. 

00:39:30
I use verse when I get bored of writing a dragging paragraph... I get nagged by this boring state that the topic holds for me. Because of that, I seek a way out to recharge my senses. A verse makes me free. A verse recharges my senses." (Savanese, "More Than a Think to Ignore..." 2010). 

00:39:30
RALPH SAVARESE "I use verse when I get bored of writing a dragging paragraph. I get nagged by this boring state that the topic holds for me. I'm making write this elaborate paragraphs to move a little bit out of poetry. Because of that I seek away out to recharge my senses, a verse makes free, a burst recharges my senses. The attachment to concrete language in autism should be clear by now but the preference for non-teleological development, non-linear development the-- ah, demands more attention. Diluted to this issue in my discussion of Tito's frost palm about the coal mining disaster. There's a word of course for the kind of language writes poet and critic (inaudible ) which puts pressure on sensory awareness which uses the visual image not primarily as trope unfolding but it's a way-- a well of inward associations and analogies lyric as in the lyric poem. What makes the lyric a distinctive motive discourse argues a Cecile Chu-chin Sun is this. It has its own particular temporary of duration which is never still but constantly and vibrantly moving enough like a dance it is not really going anywhere. In lyric poetry past present and future are shading into each other and they're by melting into an organic home. Although this home dovetails with both autistic processing and PTSD it leaves untouched the knee to facilitate temporal and sequential mastery. The question has been how did deploy lyric poems in a therapeutic setting while also supporting such mastery enter rhyme and meter. Great visual image of the stress foot with the big boot and young stress foot with the ballet shoe. Tito first encountered poetry as a result of his mother's desperation, he was so played by anxiety as a young child and his mother that so run out of waste to mollify him that one day she pumped into a recorder a type of British poetry metrical British poetry and he stop did in his tracks, becoming quite calm. 

00:41:35
"Mother reads, and still recites poetry most of the time as a background to my sound environment. It gives me a secured feeling because of the predictability formed by the pattern in words" ("More Than a Thing to Ignore..."). "A rhyme is a very linear sudatory experience. And so is the beat — be in tetrameter or in pentameter. It arouses the cortical mind with certain meaningful language experience and arouses the subcortical mind with the expectation of the mechanical beat that is offered by the lines of the poem. Anxiety is subcortical. Anxiety gets diluted by the experience". ("More Than a Thing to Ignore..."). 

00:41:35
RALPH SAVARESE In his interview with me Tito reports, "Mother reads and still recites poetry most of the time as a background to my sound environment. It gives me a secured feeling because of the predictability formed by the pattern in words." When I press them on this he replied, "A rhyme is a ve-- very linear auditory experience. And so is the beat be it in tetrameter or in pentameter. It arouses the cortical mind with certain meaningful language experience and arouses the subcortical mind with the expectation of the mechanical beat that is offered by the lines of the poem. Anxiety is subcortical. Anxiety gets diluted by the experience." So you can see, he can use the abstract language like crazy now. And in fact he now very much likes to read neuroscience and he may no more than I do about this stuff. A study from 2013, found that rhyme and regular meter lead to more possibly perceive in felt emotions. This maybe because the left cerebral hemisphere fears to be dominant for both. Simple rhythms, complex, syncopate to rhythms the way hemisphere kicks in. And as Elliot Ross has suggested the right hemisphere modulates the primary emotions while the left enhance is positive emotions but also suppresses negative once. The authors of the study noted that end rhymes and metered poetry temporally structure both single verses and their configuration within the multi-verse unit of the stanza. They use by placing additional emphasis on metrical patterning and by producing a phonological residence between two selected words with syllables in the final world-- word or syllable of a verse. Meter rhythmic reincurrences the authors and precise help the structure a verse line in time. You know, like that one. Uhm, such structuring likely engenders not only a secured feeling in Tito's phrase but also a kind of enabling pleasure. As Frederick Turner's remark by ruling out certain rhythmic possibilities meter satif-- satisfies the brain for crusty demand for an ambiguity and clear distinctions. But combining elements of repetition on one hand with variation on the other it nicely fulfills the habituate of need for controlled novelty, controlled novelty. A system of rhythmic organization as well as a circumscribed set of semantic and syntactical possibilities encourages the brain in it synthetic and predictive activity of hypothesis construction and raises expectations which were pleasingly satisfied at once. This expectations we might say help to pull the listener or reader into the future, literally pull them especially somebody with classical autism. One way of understanding meters effect is to remember in the words of Jerry Levy that the left hemisphere map spatial information to a temporal order and while, while the right hemisphere maps temporal information into a special order. In this recent epic work on cerebral lateralization in (inaudible ) out the difference. And it's often been said that the left hemisphere is the hemisphere of linear processing. 

00:44:50
"It has often been said that the left hemisphere is the hemisphere of "linear processing" its cognitive style is sequential hence its propensity to linear analysis is to mechanical construction taking the bits apart, or putting them together one by one... Cognition in the right hemisphere is not a process of something coming into being through adding piece to piece in a sequence but of something is out of focus coming into focus as a whole. Everything is understood within its penumbra of significances, in its context — all that encircles it." (Iain McGilchrist, The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of "The Western World". 2012). 

00:44:50
RALPH SAVARESE Its cognitive style is sequential hence it's propensity the linear analysis works mechanical construction taking the bits a part or putting them together one by one. Cognition in the right hemisphere is not a process of something coming into being through adding piece to piece in a sequence but of something is out of focus coming into focus as a whole. Everything is understood within its penumbra of significances, in its context all that encircles it. In classical autism meter and rhyme may does act as a kind of temporal sequential prosthesis. A study from 2012 appears to support what Tito's reported. Uhm, it found that structure, rhythmic, interventions at a slow tempo can reduce hyper arousal, anxiety and fighter flight fear behaviors in children with autism. Symptoms at the study tie to deficient sensory information processing and that render the autism, ah, that render the autism in their judgment stress disorder. With the 60 beat per minute simple rhythmic pattern which have been programed on electric keyboard in the background subjects performed the range of tasks. The resulting, ah, intervention induce be more regulated, internalize, synchronize rhythm, systematically coordinating and beha-- facing, ah, behaviors. In addition a bit, a motor planning subjects also exhibited very significantly improved eye constant and attention. Here we can see in Tito's version of the intervention he had words to this rhythmic intervention the power of what I been calling word yoga or what could just as well be called, linguistic occupational therapy. I mean this quite literally and when I built that trampoline house a strong words surround an editing closure and we made moving and jumping, ah, communicative act linguistically communicative act. In his interview with me, Tito all but says that William Blake, the 18th century British taught him how to tie his shoes. Wrapping the tetrameter of a beloved poem around his fingers he finally coax them at the age of 19 to execute the necessary movements. Researchers have shown that listening to a metrical poem activates the listeners motor systems. Even if you're perfectly still as parts of the brain that coordinate motion are also recruited by metrical writing it makes all the more sense that poems may make us wish to keep time move and imagine motion. Gabriel Starr contains meter producers motor imagery in the same way that concrete words produce, ah, mental visual imagery. And such imagery because auditory when the poem is read aloud and visual when it involves concrete diction is by definition multri-- multi-sensory. When finally mastering the active tying his shoes Tito may have use his ears to move his fingers sequentially. He may have circumvented motor problems in autism that are now increasingly well documented by exploiting the braided multi-sensory nature of perceptual experience. sufficiently organize and in amplified by entrainment mechanisms one modality and he ever assisted the performance of another. In the following poem which Tito wrote at age 11, and which uses rhyming couplets in a steady meter to evoke a sight-seeing trip through London the various effects of metrical verse come together, from quelling anxiety to facilitating temporal progression to enabling motoric fluency which allowed Tito to physically write the poem independently in the first place.

Tower of Londong, strong as death, Breathing the echos of last breaths Of those punish by the law, their ministry breath is what I saw and There's Big Ben, Big Ben Telling us now is when And Churchill Churchill standing there In the chill With your stick to lean your weight Pity the stick did not break People stiff and people swift People of busy mood People friendly and people good Under the cloudy skies People with sincerity undisguised I did not manage to see the Queen Yet her palace with grave discipline Stood since yonder grave discipline I saluted it from the red bus (The Mind Tree 2000) 

00:48:35
RALPH SAVARESE Tower of Londong, strong as death, breathing the ecos of last breaths of those punish by the law, their ministry breath is what I saw and there's Big Ben, Big Ben telling us now is when and Churchill, Churchill standing there in the chill with your stick to lean your weight. Pity the stick did not break people stiff and people swift. People of busy mood, people friendly and people good under the cloudy skies. People with sincerity undisguised. I did not manage to see the Queen yet her palace with grave discipline stood since yonder grave discipline I saluted it from the red bus. Tito finds England's mythic past in the escalation of city dwellers indeed he finds winter's chill at the end of the former Prime Minister's name. Such gestures are characteristic of lyric poetry. And yet the twirling motion of the couplets none unlike a slinky descending a set of stairs propels the poem and the poet forward a special order to put it simply gain a temporal one. Might the use of mythical poetry foster temporal sequential master in PTSD? Might it help to swage anxiety? Might the phenomenon of controlled novelty with respect to metrical stress and rhyme work to ameliorate hyper vigilance that predictive activity of hypothesis construction in Turner's phrase 'run amok'. There isn't time to get into this but at least one study has shown that metrical poetry recitation specifically examiner verse increases respiratory sinus arrhythmia which is generally low in PTSD to cardiorespiratory synchronization. The low frequency breathing patterns of examiner recitation exert a strong influence on her essay. The study's authors wrote, "Interestingly, the benefits of examiner recitation exceeded those of control breathing exercises without such relaxation and we could talk about why that might be. And the benefits of metrical poetry for PTSD may not in there as metrical patterning has been shown to aid cog-- cognition in a number of ways. It orients attention, it facilitates memory both semantic and non-semantic elements. It enhances the prediction of stress location which in turn facilitates lexical semantic integration. And it lesses-- lessens cognitive processing load. Each of these benefits might help to soften the cognitive deficits that appear to come with PTSD . By way of conclusion I wanna underscore a point that Bessel made in 2006 name the importance in trauma therapy of taking affective action seriously. But I wanna propose that we may be able to do this at least impart with poetry. In her muti-sensory analysis of a poem by Elizabeth Bishop, Gabrielle Starr remarks, "The poem makes its claim to exceptional imagine of vivacity because imagine motion is what it offers its readers." She might have said, simulated motion in the brain is what it offers its readers. The motion is real as any involving actual movement. In this way mo-- metrical poetry may be able to rescript the po-- ah, the passive victimization of trauma. It may be able to forge new connections between the senses as Starr would have. And to do this at the very place that trauma takes up resonance. For the last 25 years any number of disciplines had been articulating a theory of embodied cognition putting aside the old Cartesian split. Language had emerge from the body not just from the mouth. It is in elaboration extension and abstraction of sensory motor function according Marcel Kinsbourne the valve from other incest that were co-incident with and driven by the same rhythm is the movement in question. The existence of a close relationship between bodily gesture and verbal syntax, writes (inaudible ) implies it is not just concrete nouns the thing words, but even the most apparently formal and logical elements of language that originate in the body and emotion the deep structure of syntax has founded on the thick sequences of lean movements in running creatures. At one point in the five sense Michel Serres lements the lack of a trampolinian upbringing. When I saw this I like jumped out of my-- first time I read this. And then with lyrical panache, cuz you have understanding Grinnell, Iowa I am the crazy man that built a trampoline house in the back alley, like 600 square feet. Everybody want to come to it but I was crazy. 

00:53:20
At one point in The Five Senses, Michel Serres laments the lack of a "trampolinian upbringing" and then with lyrical panache, describes two acrobats twirling above a trampoline and chatting in the air "This is where speech comes from." Serres exclaims 

00:53:20
RALPH SAVARESE Ah, so let's start-- as Serres laments the lack of a trapompolinian upbringing and then with lyrical panache, describes two actrobats twirling above a trampoline and chatting in the air. This is where speech comes from. He exclaims. Poetry will fully even excessively, ah, preserves its connection to the body and thus if any form of language is up to the therapeutic challenge of PTSD, it is one that bounces and twirls, yet never forgets the impressionable floor from which and on which it constantly arises. A close with the poem that my son wrote with his permission, you know, he said, "Yes, show them." Ah, a close to the poem that my son wrote during the spring semester at Oberlin, entitled, "My Adoptive Father Buys a Trampoline." Uhm, it's in a very demanding form called the pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of the first stanza become the first and third lines of the second stanza and so on and so forth until the poem concludes by repeating the very first line of the first stanza. And you can see, the trampoline house and there the three of us are. I should tell you that jumping on a trampoline was something that my son and I did each and everyday for hours on end. I have a left artificial hip now. Ah, from the moment I assembled that netted contraption early in the second year of our new family until he left for Oberlin. The trampoline was so important to our banding and his development that when we move to Iowa as I told, I built and indoor trampoline house so that we could keep jumping during the winter. And I should-- I'll continue this one. I should also tell you that shortly after my son arrive from foster care at 6 in diaper we watch a remake of the old Disney film Herbie the Love Bug, I not recommend it but DJ alludes to the film in the pantoum. I mean to the-- yeah, yeah to the film. Notice how the pattern, the pantoum pattern coordinate sensory perceptions affect in a self-reflective intelligence notice to how the poem finds, finds, uhm, the straight line or linear line of the future in a paradoxically circular way. 

00:55:40
My Adoptive Father Buys a Trampoline Like newly laid asphalt, the black mat baked in the Florida sun, at once taut and spongy. This ridiculous highway, which sat baking in the Florida sun, afforded my father and me the most ridiculous of highs. We bounced up and around, my new father and I, on this improbable racetrack up, up and around, bouncing like Herbie, the Love Bug (his racetrack just as improbable as ours). My new name—not Herbie, the Love Bug— hugged me like a guardrail. A new Italian last name was just what a foster kid needed, hugging me like a guardrail on newly laid asphalt. 

00:55:40
RALPH SAVARESE "My Adoptive Father Buys a Trampoline. Like newly laid asphalt, the black mat baked in the. Florida sun, at once taut and spongy.

My new name not Herbie the Love Bug--" I love that, "hugged me like a guardrail. A new Italian last name was just what a foster kid needed, hugging me like a guardrail on newly laid asphalt." Thank you very much. 

00:56:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Two things are great how about you speak, the other thing is effectively have DVDs of this of the speech will be available. So you can reflects on this because as you can may want to certainly go over this. Once or twice for him. And the third things is that I'm absolutely grateful that William is here. As he talking about, ah, because, ah, a months ago we were up in (inaudible ) New York where, uhm, ah, Bernard Plansky is working and doing Shakespeare with veterans. Uhm, a very was veterans. And William was the essay teacher to help these guys to articulate lines and to get into division of words and it's a different task experience, which actually have been inspired by Tina Packer being here a few years ago, wa-- ah, teaching us about it (inaudible ) in trauma. And so in summary it all gets together somehow. And I'm sure that we will really love this presentation because it's really, really, emphasize wider power of oximeter and words, and language and movement together if frozen people is so, incredibly important. So it's great. Uhm, so, the panelist haven the privilege of responding to each other first and there's-- the other thing I want to say is the issue of time. Has it-- Sandy talk in morning about the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex being knocked out huge issue, huge issue but you just see it's, ah, it's the sense of time gets knocked out, traumatize people so the past is the present, they're living the past all the time. They do not go for the (inaudible ) time sending those (inaudible ). Uhm, and how do you get time back into people's minds so that they know, now is now and tomorrow is tomorrow, and yesterday is yesterday. Uhm, and we will tell EMDR research we showed that when we did EMDR those temporal things change dramatically. Panelist open for discussion. 

00:58:35
RALPH SAVARESE I just though so-- honey, you too. 

00:58:40
Debra Wesselmann, MS, LIMHP 

00:58:40
DEBRA WESSELMANN I would ju-- ah, I'll just piggyback on that but the, the kids are come in and have they are stuck in trauma time. And, uhm, it-- their ro-- their melt downs are in my mind emotional flashbacks. And when they're in a meltdown the, the past is now. And, uhm, this is one of the, I think most important pieces to teach parents as well that you're-- parents want to discipline when children have melt downs, melt downs or stuck-- ah, ah, melt downs or children stuck in the past and stuck in emotions that they can't manage. And I love the way that, that you talked about your son's melt downs and, and how you and your wife responded. If every parent could be like this - 

00:59:25
RALPH SAVARESE No. No. 

00:59:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN - it would be so fantastic. 

00:59:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Whe-- where do this film comes in? 

00:59:30
RALPH SAVARESE We'll see a far less idea. 

00:59:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK In the meantime I urge you guys to line up behind the microphone in case you would like to ask some questions about. And you have the three presentations this morning, so I have a sense of time of how many people we need to make a room for. So if you just-- microphone to either end. So if you have any comments, questions please line up behind the microphone, okay? 

00:59:55
Alexander McFarlane, MBBS (Hons), M.D. 

00:59:55
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Can I just make one of the comment about time. Cuz, eh, eh-- you know, what's fascinating he's about people's ability to estimate time. And if you think about the association. I mean one of the issues is the people that you lose time. And, uhm, one day is we, we-- that's being collected he's-- uhm, the, the (inaudible ) and I actually just , ah, collect the finger-tapping test. So you get the people to tap-- ah, about on the screen and you measured in the inta-- interval tap. And you, and you think that's like an extremely simply basic neurological function. The fascinating thing is that people with PTSD tactless frequently and (inaudible ) distortion between the taps. And, and it must-- until it must tell you something about the rhythmicity of cortical functioning because essentially our brains are constantly re-- clearing himself with program, clearing himself with program and, and you would think that would be happening in a, in, in a synchronous and fixed in way. Because-- I mean I think the other thing about acting in language is, uhm, ah,-- and, you know, watching your videos of, of dealing with children. I mean you're asking these children to create an image which they have empathy. And, ah, I think the encourage of, of the metering circulatory in the brain is a fast thing issue, extent which you can do that with yourself as well as another. And I mean that was one of the beautiful things about, you know, what you showed. And I guess one of the things about using other people's language which you then become proud of is about how you can actually engage with that, uhm, that, that sort of e-- emphatic, sort of reflection. And, ah, other people's words are often probably than their own. 

01:01:40
RALPH SAVARESE The only way to add is that I, I just cannot tell you how important is trampoline was. Ah, if you watch my son walk in the ground you'd see some profoundly uncoordinated. Within a couple of weeks on this trampoline suddenly, e-- e-- e, he's, he's (inaudible ) brothers. But what the trampoline did two was given this temporal sense, he got constant proprioceptive feedback as in classical autism just all of these stuff is out of wrack in body. So he's getting proprioceptive feedback but also getting that regular rhythmic bounce. When you get good into trampoline and he reports that, that, that was really crucial. That was a crucial element here. And then, I start thinking, you know, why it's a poem like a trampoline and try to then combined these things make jumping a kind of linguistic activity. 

01:02:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And that's regards trauma, ah, but this first can be similar autism. I don't see that right now but, uhm, we've done workshops on bodies in traumatize people in the electroshock movies of traumatize people. The air frozen and very poorly coordinated but, you know, a residence of treating programs one of the most striking things is, is everyday you do all these wonderful things but the movement of the kids is still sort of dissociated, ah, swimming in the water type go to that stuff. And, ah, I think, uhm, cultivating them I think cultivating really focus action was in one of our people in (inaudible ) area with kids, ah, boxing. Ah, very, very focus into actual things when you learn how to organize musculature in relationship to other people is very poor issue. You have one que-- two questions over there. Okay. 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN Quick question for De-- Debra. Uhm, in your work with-- I think it-- ah, the, the little boy from Guatemala, uhm, when you were using the bears and the tiger was there another season with him and if not, uhm, I'm curious about when you work with other children, where he process the feelings of lost and abandonment and separation, uhm, from the-- I think it was the tiger mother way. 

01:04:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN Uhm, that-- we work together-- at that point we work together for about 6 months and, and did a lot of stories and work and added tapping and parents holding him, uhm. I didn't see them for a couple of years and then he came back at a little bit older age where he had, you know, more language and we did a little but more work with, ah, the feelings of it and so on. So, uhm, a lot of times with those little once you do, you can do a little piece and then they can come back later and do a little bit more. Uhm, he's 6 now I recently saw him for just a little bit over some school anxiety but it's been kind of, ah, you know, overtime working with a little bit and a little bit, yes, but-- we-- a lot of the kids grief is, ah, grief and lost is, ah, a huge piece of what we work with and, uhm, to support them and for the parents to have the compassion and support them during the processing of the grief, ah, provides a real window of opportunity not just to help resolve and move to that grief for that attach relationship to give them that opportunity to, to show compassion. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN All right. I was partly asking it, as a mother of en-- adoptee and it's always that parallel of, you know, dealing with the lost, being lost and found at the same. 

01:05:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN Yes, yes. 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:05:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Sandy(ph). 

01:05:25
SANDY Uhm, I have a question about, uhm, working with people with mild autistic spectrum traits. So, in my whole career we did a lot of adolescents and young adults who show up through sight testing and socially, uhm, as having kind of diminished visual special capacities, uhm, high degrees of cognitive rigidity, social dysfunction. And, and so as I'm listening to your talk I was wondering about two things, the, uhm, in, in treatment the inner section of working with the spectrum traits verses, uhm, doing kinda trauma treatment and imbalance there and is that have been a relevant distinction. And then two, I also-- no, I'm using a lot of neuro feedback I'm wondering is there particular aspect of kind of the brain that I should be focusing on a neuro feedback with that. 

01:06:15
RALPH SAVARESE Uhm, I mean, ah, ah, I think that, uhm, a lot of what we see in the literature describing a whole range of deficits and autism has its core in anxiety and I don't think any of us will do all of these things very well if we are literally unbelievably overcome by anxiety. And the group I work with are the folks that we would call severely autistic. And I've, I've work with some as-- Asperger, ah, kids. But, ah, I try to go after the anxiety because then if you can alleviate the anxiety that's why your friends here talk so incredibly powerful. Uhm, if I can get it that a little bit I start seeing, ah, ah, a closer sort of, uhm, sense of what they really can do cuz I'm not convince that some of those visuospatial deficits are actual deficits. I think their, their artifacts, ah, ah, of the situation increase anxiety when we're measuring them, they come in anxious and we measure them, they're more anxious. Uhm, and ha-- how do you, how do you work with that first? But we've had, we've, we've gone back and forth cuz, cuz my son really has-- he was really tortured, uhm, and, ah, it's been very, very though to know what part of this. It's sort like balloon, you press here and, and thing comes out over there. So, ah, ah, I don't have it-- a ton of wisdom on that but we have found the most success if we can, ah, ah, swage the anxiety a little bit. And then we see where the strengths are. And this is not just for my son but with other kids especially when I'm trying to teach them, uhm, how to write poetry. 

01:07:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK As in issue in three demand sources always that you had this hyper arouse organism that's always in, in face of the (inaudible ). And the question hasn't be resolve and I hope that our morning panel that sort of would fall out a little bit more (inaudible ). And that's that, uhm, so-- a law of the anxiety is memory driven and the specific traumatic memory. And if you can neutralize this traumatic memory people just go into the state of relaxation. And that's really about the EMDR sometimes can do. So it's just. So the question is do you sort of focus generally coming this whole organism done with something like neuro feedback or yoga, or any of the number of things that we do. And to what degree we can shortcut our enormous efforts to calm the whole system down but I just going into the trauma. We've think about. And we didn't quite get there today, uhm, but it continuous to be, ah, a really critical question and sometimes it's can be done. I wonder what Sandy has think about it. 

01:08:55
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Ah, I just, ah, uhm, saying two things I think Bessel has correct this-- pointed out how the traumatic memory, uhm, obviously drives a lot of the anxiety but the other point that's very relevantly autism story, I think. Which is I think also a part of PTSD but we generally don't think about it because it's not what people complain of. It's the lack of the sensory filter. 

01:09:15
RALPH SAVARESE Yes. 

01:09:15
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Because if you, if, if you-- ever in the world it's like people have go-- have become catatonic. It's like you-- the-- this just you overwhelmed by sensory import. And I never forget probably one of the most, uhm, memorable talks I ever went to is that, ah, ah, colleague who was talking about the nature of EEG and saying that really it's an extraordinary thing when you think about the human brain. But it suits between epilepsy and mental retardation. And, ah, and it's the extraordinary ability to sit somewhere, you know, start of intimated modulation that can fluctuate enormously the inhibitory systems punctuate enormously according to the environment theory. And the problem is-- and I think, you know, things like agoraphobia for example, uhm, is driven often by people not being out to screen out sensory environments. And then just becoming totally over arouse. Uhm, so, in-- in-- in terms of how you might address in, ah, you know, a feedback that I'm, ah, ah, I have very little experience in term that, that the, uhm, clinical prospective. But, ah, I, I think it, it's really about actually measuring motors information processing difference at all. They might be driven tough down but equally I think that disruption of the, ah, of the filters is so important to measuring your environment. 

01:10:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK It's usual-- I mean we pick it up in a quantity of EEGs and it was also very clear and you see it's in the poetry. It's, ah, that language the-- does not primarily get use as a communicative thing. So u-- so use your language try desperately organize that, that lack of (inaudible ) but it doesn't bring you closer to other people. And the function of language is to connect us with each other. And, ah, ah, the-- that's the big issue there kept thinking about as you, as you were talking, you see it's also in traumatize people. You got to be so content lonely because speech is not use for communication but uses to (inaudible ) for self-organization. Uhm... 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN Yes. I have more of, ah, ah, a comment, uhm, please forgive my hyper arousal standing in front of an audience. But, uhm, I, ah, I'm a non-traditional student who, ah, has gone back to school, uhm, I dropped out to school because, uhm, well I found that healing was, was my education. And, uhm, so I, uhm, about 15 years ago I was, ah, ah, patient in, ah, at Ramona Ranch. Uhm, I was to see that here too. But, I'm, ah, I'm studying psychology and... 

01:11:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Can you-- hey. Can you ask your question? 

01:11:55
UNKNOWN Well, I, ah, I just wanted to say that, uhm, it's so exciting for me to be here, uhm, and hearing that, uhm, that this, ah,-- the summary of this conference to me what comes up is creativity over and over again. And, uhm, ah, looking at whether it be, uhm, as a clinician and treatment, uhm, or as, ah, healing as a create of act, uhm, and tapping, literally tapping into the essence of, of being human and the authentic creative impulse and I just think. It's so exciting to hear that that's where the fields going cuz I wanted to run from school and, uhm, you know, I-- knowing that it was in my body that I had to reground, uhm, so I just very exciting and I'm appreciate it. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN Thank you for saying that. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. Thank you. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Now. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Is there time? Okay, thank you all for your talks I thought they were great and complemented each other in, in different ways. I was wondering in (inaudible ) what we just heard, uhm, how you all would describe and conceptualize what we know about how EMDR and other therapies that have some evidence how they work in the brain. 

01:13:10
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Well, uhm, well in fact, in fact-- look I think the-- in defe-- ah, one slide I didn't use my talk today which I cut out in, in, in each of time was Freud actually said it perfectly. He said, "The, the, the aim is to connect the individual with the memory of what this occurred." And whatever we thinks that Freud then said was just to experience the effect, but that's not what he said, he what, what he said was to convert the memory and the effect into language. And, ah, and if you think about it from, ah, biological, neurological perspective I mean essentially that's involving multiple circuitries, it's involving your-- some of the century and your association courtesies and it's involving your linguistic circuitry. And, you know, so much of what has been talked about at this meeting is about the lack of flexibility and the lack of ability to switch between that works. And also that the association really is about that this connection to those systems and that's what Freud talked about, he, he, you know, disassociation was about these lacuna of consciousness that weren't connected. And so, that's not I showed of the lack of inter connectivity between brain regions. I mean, ah, ah, ah, I think it's about ultimately how you make the brain again work as a synchronize connected organiz-- or-- organize system. Because, you know, our brains weren't design to speak. You know, we've just, ah, you know, the-- that one last tips in human evolution was this (inaudible ) larynx. So we actually had all mechanisms for speech in our brain that will being used for other things. And miraculously that somehow sort of got together. So it's not surprising that it's a fragile system that can be disrupted. Uhm, and, you know, and I think that's ultimately if we would really understand the neurology of treatment, uhm, it's, it's, ah, it's about making sure there's long fiber systems, uhm, that hold the brain together. Ah, make, make the whole thing. You can't run your computer on one program. You know, you've got-- you need to have Explorer, you need to have Safari, you need to have, you know, uhm, you know, Microsoft, Word, you know, you've got to have PowerPoint. And if you're just trying to run one program you can't do it. 

01:15:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK About Freud said is where it was I shall come to be. And it is all that traumatic stuff all these sensations and feelings and stuff. And when people overcome the trauma these are presence in the room and their whole frontal cortex lights up. But when we did some-- our first pre-post EMDR study, neuroimaging study what you saw is a major lighting up very surprisingly of the basal ganglia of the brain which organizes the movement and the fo-- prefrontal cortex. This is very surprising for any, ah, big-- the big change of (inaudible ) basal ganglia that organizes movement and direction and the anterior cingulate, ah, which organizes the integration of, uhm, cognition and, and emotion. Uhm, but the reason I suppose to start another EMDR study a few-- ah, next month. So we'll have the answer to that next year. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN I think this is a great question. Famous last words, but, uhm, e-- as are any of you aware of any research in the use of percussion as a treatment modality with per... 

01:16:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Brain-- be-- Brandon(ph), in Johannesburg, ah, that, ah, Bradon(ph) is-- either his first name or his last name. Google him. Ah, Brandon(ph), and (inaudible ). And his name will come up. 

01:17:00
UNKNOWN He thought... 

01:17:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK in Dorita Berger. 

01:17:00
RALPH SAVARESE So the, the, uhm, recent 2012 Dorita Berger study I say that about a laying, uhm, fight or flight fear-based behavior and autism involved one of the task was drumming. And so-- and there are lots of people out there I think Susan Oliver, uhm, whose I think in Arizona now but, uhm, and is, and is working on, on a study. 

01:17:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay, uhm, quick question. 

01:17:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. Uhm, I have a question about, you know, poetry the way I understand it is that it's, ah, it was made to be spoken and recite of more than rhythm. So I was wondering if, if you'd ever found that, uhm, uhm, with autistic, uhm, ah, people if, if it was more something if they were able to of-- or if it help when, when they were talking or reciting it, if that was somehow can use as supposed to just writing it down. 

01:18:00
RALPH SAVARESE So the group, the group I work with does and speak. I mean they can sub vocalize and in fact that's how Tito revises his work. He sort of speaks his work to himself the way that we might subvocalize when we're reading. But I think one of the first things my son ever type because I just happen to be in the habit of reading one poem a day out loud to my wife for years and years. And one of the first things he type was very great sound, very great sound. 

01:18:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:18:30
RALPH SAVARESE And, uhm, ah, so we, we, we've-- we do a lot of just reading poetry out loud. Uhm, and, and coordinate some movement, ah, in to that, uhm, is that what you're getting at? 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:40
RALPH SAVARESE Yeah. And, and, and but, but I think the key was I wanted to both move the, the, these kids in the language and then beyond the language of poetry. And, and if you, ah, had to force me to speculate absolutely wildly, uhm, ah, I've wonder they're lateralizing late the way illiterate who learn to read, let's say in the late '10s or '20 - 

01:19:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:19:05
RALPH SAVARESE - lateralized late but don't lateralized fully. 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:19:05
RALPH SAVARESE As, as kids who normally read. I thinks-- I think has, ah, ah, an affect. 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:19:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay. We, we really should be stopping but the, the two people are sending here including list. I cannot tell you that you can't ask a question, so Bernard(ph) and Liz(ph) and that's it. Okay. 

01:19:20
BERNARD Dr. Mc-- Dr. McFarlane, uhm, looking at the screen for longitudinal, people at risk. How would you, how you structure a screening approach if trauma was thought of in terms of an injury to we social, human social animals, when traumatized are now outside the circle of our tribe vulnerable without a tribe to protect us and yet continuing throughout life doing all of our things. What are the signs that would recognize here as a social animal who needs help? 

01:20:05
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE My goodness, uhm... 

01:20:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK You have, you have 30 seconds to answer this one. 

01:20:15
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT You know, I think what I would be measuring, ah, and there's, ah, the paradigms for doing is actually measuring people's ability to read fluctuation expression, actually. Cuz I think one of the fundamental, ah, uhm, tools of social interaction is the ability to, ah, scan a patient's face and respond to the fluctuations and ethic that shown. And we know that the amygdala circuitry is absolutely critically involved in that process. Uhm, as has the hippocampus and, you know, the medial and the lateral, ah, frontal systems. And you can actually see this-- the, the, the destruction of that system. Ah, you know, I think that such a fundamental instrument of social engagement that you can actually measure sort of degradation. So if there is one thing I do probably to do that. 

01:21:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK All right. Liz(ph). 

01:21:05
LIZ Ah, uhm. So, I, I wanted to bring up the, ah, the motor system and I started to raise it with you. 

01:21:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK What system? 

01:21:15
LIZ The motor system. 

01:21:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uh-huh. 

01:21:15
LIZ Uhm, one of the things we learn from sensory integration is that the motor system is part of the sensory system. And we know that sensations are problematic for people with trauma. Uhm, but we don't talk about the motor system as part of the sensory system as often. But I was, uhm, conscious of what you said Ralph about that jumping in trampoline. I don't think that's inconsequential and that had-- didn't, you know, that it had some impact on what was happening with your son. Uhm, I think it introduce all kinds of things that, you know, were helpful to him in terms of integrating. Uhm, but the, but this was the first time I ever had the thought about EMDR as engaging the vestibular system. And I wonder if anybody had thought about that because there's a whole business of the ocular movement. Uhm, after, ah, the spinning that you see. I wondered if anybody knew anything about that in relation to the vestibular system. Is the vestibular system engage as you do EMDR, as you do this kind of movement. And I thought of it as you, your boy was doing his EMDR with the light box and we could watch his eyes going back and forth. But we know at the end of spinning there's a sciatic movement that is supposed to occur. It doesn't happen and many of our traumatized kids. 

01:22:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK You'll find out, you know, talk with (inaudible ) about it also. 

01:22:40
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Ah, look I think, I think is a fascinating one because the vestibular system is a system that we think is to do with balance, ah, uhm, and all that you've hearing. But if you look at the structure of the spinal cord and, and the brain steam. Vestibular form of pathways and vestibular cortical pathways are extremely dense. And there's a whole literature that sort have been forgotten about settle vestibular abnormalities. You know, range of psychiatric disorders. Uhm, and if you think about it one of them must extraordinary abilities to him and brain is it's been-- and you can tested in yourself, it's a bit like I told to all look at the, se-- the, the, ah, the, the, the life fitting on the top of the left hand (inaudible ). The ability to move your head and fix your (inaudible ) at a point is so fundamental that we sense is so far intonation I think it's just disrupted in some way. 

01:23:30
UNKNOWN All right. 

01:23:30
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE It's extremely disorganizing. And, you know, I think many of the people who for example have panic disorder, actually lose that ability, ah, and lose the ability to monitor internal (inaudible ) as consequence. So any treatment that begins to address that. And, uhm, and, and just another issue there's a whole classification system with depression that's base on being cycle motor disorder. 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:23:50
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And you can actually measure cycle motor dysfunction in people were depress. Ah, you know, because don't complain about it. We don't think about it and we tend to live in sort of, ah, sort of disembodied mind. But, uhm, so that there's a whole system there which I think we, we really should pay much, much more attention to it. Now, being able to (inaudible ) EMDR work got nice but, you know, there is something certainly that we need to think about.
