00:00:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Hi! I'm Kelley Kenney, a professor and counselor at Kutztown University, where I've been for 17 years. I teach graduate students in the Department of Counseling and Human Services. 

00:01:10
MARK KENNEY And I'm Mark Kenney. I'm a counselor as well and director of Rainbow Support Network, a consulting and training service. I'm also a teacher of courses on diversity and gender identities. 

00:01:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Mark and I have been together as a couple for 17 years. We met and began dating in 1984. A major concern and question at the start of our relationship and up to the point of our marriage had to do with the respect of, and acceptance of our relationship by others in our lives, specifically, our families. As Mark and I have listened to and worked with other interracial couples and families, we've discovered that we were not alone in this concern, which is one of the reasons why we decided to do this videotape. 

00:01:55
MARK KENNEY Kelley and I have been married for 13 years and we have two girls, ages six and ten. Our involvement in work on this topic is related to our personal journey as a couple and as a family. We have a variety(ph) of positive and challenging experiences over the years that have been enhanced to our growth and development as a couple and as a family. 

00:02:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Our professional involvement in this topic began in 1992, when I began conducting research with interracial couples, specifically Black-White couples. During the course of talking with couples, I discovered that the counseling profession had done very little to address the needs of this population. In 1996, Mark and I began working with the American Counseling Association regarding how they could begin to address the needs and concerns of this population and raise the consciousness and awareness of the counseling profession and human services professions on how to competently and sensitively work with the multi-racial population. 

00:02:55
MARK KENNEY We began with what is now a special interest group in the American Counseling Association called, "The Multiracial/Multiethnic Counseling Concern Interest Network." We continue to do conference programs, workshops and professional development institute all geared to educating the profession. In 1998, with Dr. B. Wehrly, we began writing a book, which was published August 1999 through SAGE Publications entitled, "Counseling Multiracial Families." Since then, we continue to do with work within our profession, conducting workshops, publishing articles and book chapters. We are motivated to do this by our own family circumstances as well as families that we have met through both our professional and personal interactions. These interactions have shown us that there's a need for better understanding regarding the realities of personal journeys and everyday experiences of the multiracial population. 

00:03:50
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY In terms of the purpose of this videotape, the Counseling and Human Services professions have only recently begun to look seriously at the issues and concerns of the multiracial population. This tape series is meant to provide some additional insights and awarenesses about the multiracial population that will speak to the issues, concerns, challenges, and strengths of the population. 

00:04:15
Defining and Understanding the Multi-Racial Population: The Need for Multicultural Competence 

00:04:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  In talking about the multiracial population, it is important to talk about and define who the population includes. First, there are interracial couples. These are couples in which the partners are of two or more different socially designated social groups. This includes heterosexual as well as gay/lesbian couples. Multiracial individuals: This include individuals whose parents are of two or more different racial backgrounds. And finally, multiracial families: These are families composed of interracial couples and their multiracial offspring; single parents, including gay and lesbian individuals with biological offspring who are multiracial; families in which a cross-racial or trans-racial adoption or foster care arrangement has occurred; and gay and lesbian couples or single individuals who have adopted trans-racially or providing foster care or have gone through a circuit pregnancy process or artificial insemination process which results in the birth of a multi-racial child. 

00:05:35
MARK KENNEY In this segment, we will review common myths and stereotypes of the multi-racial population. First, interracial couples: People who partner interracially are rebelling against family; men of color partner with White women because they represent ideal female beauty; people of color partner with Whites for status; Whites partner with people of color because they are sexually exotic; Whites partner with people of color because they feel guilty about White racism and want to get back at a racist society; men of color partner With white women because they can assert more control over them; women of color partner with White men because men of color are sexist and chauvinistic; only people of colors support interracial unions. Second, multi-racial individuals. Multi-racial individuals are doomed to a life of conflicting cultures and unfulfilled desires to be one or the other. Multi-racial children are messed up and confused. Given a choice, multi-racial children choose a minority identity. Multi-racial individuals are sexually immoral and out of control. Multi-racial people are beautiful, handsome, and exotic. Third, cross-racial or trans-racial adopted or foster care multi-racial families. Only well-meaning White people adopt cross-racially. Whites adopt cross-racially in an attempt to resolve guilt about White racism. Children who are adopted cross-racially lose their racial identity. People of color who were adopted by Whites are confused about their racial heritage and background. 

00:07:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  In this next segment, we will discuss the salient issues and concerns from members of the multi-racial population. A concern that cuts across all three groups within the multi-racial population is the level of societal, community, family, respect, acceptance, and understanding that is experienced. A major concern for couples is the development of a positive identity as a couple. The major issues or concerns for families are the development of a healthy family structure and the development of a positive identity as a family. Finally, the salient issue or concern for multi-racial individuals, as well as for cross-racial adopted individuals, is the development of a positive racial and ethnic identity and self-concept. In this last segment, we will discuss the importance of multicultural counseling competence in working with the multi-racial population. Multicultural counseling competence requires the counselors and helping professionals be aware of their own cultural values and biases, be aware of their client's world view, and develop culturally, appropriate intervention strategies. In working with the multi-racial population, it is important that counselors and helping professionals examine their values, attitudes and beliefs about interracial couples, multi-racial individuals, multi-racial families, and cross-racial adoption. Counselors and helping professionals must also be open to becoming fully aware of the world view and experiences of interracial couples, multi-racial individuals, multi-racial families, and cross-racial adoptees and their families. Finally, strategies utilized in working with interracial couples, multi-racial individuals, multi-racial families, and cross-racial adoptees and their families must take into account their different world views and experiences. 

00:09:25
Introduction to the Vignettes 

00:09:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  In the next section of this tape, you will see a series of vignettes that provide illustrations and examples of some of the issues that members of the multi-racial population come into counseling to address. You will notice that some of these concerns are related to the many external pressures that interracial couples, multi-racial individuals, and multi-racial families experienced as they attempt to navigate the world around them. The counselors will demonstrate multicultural sensitivity and awareness by utilizing strategies that imperil clients and assist them in drawing from their strengths, in dealing with and resolving the challenges and difficulties they face. 

00:10:40
Vignette #1: Multi-racial Individual 

00:10:40
MARK KENNEY  Laura is 23 years old and a professional meeting planner. Her mother is Native American and her dad is of Italian heritage. Her parents raised her by allowing her to identify with all of her backgrounds. She also has a system of supportive, extended family and friends. She had initiated counseling due to current difficulties in her work life experience with people who are struggling with her identity. She travels to many different places in United States and the world. People have been making assumptions about her identity based upon their world view and not inquiring about her identity. She is feeling frustrated with this situation. This is Laura's third counseling session. She has discussed family background and personal history. She has already informed us about her life growing up as a multi-racial ethnic person. At the end of the last session, Laura shared her work experience with us. Now, we will start the third session. 

00:11:40
MARK KENNEY  Hi, Laura. We spent the first few sessions getting to know each other. But it seemed at the end of the second session, you really wanted to discuss this work life experience and difficulty that you're having in your work life. 

00:11:55
LAURA Uhm. 

00:11:55
MARK KENNEY Where would you like to start with that? 

00:12:00
LAURA Recently at work, it seems that some of my co-workers are having trouble identifying my ethnicity and then dealing with it. Uhm, as you know, I'm a meeting (inaudible ) planner and I travel all over the world and stay the few (inaudible ) for short periods of time. While I'm there, there was people that questioned me, who were assumed I'm the soulmate(ph)(inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:12:22
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:22
LAURA We don't come out and ask me. And then, he was disagree with me. It's just kinda get a little frustrating. 

00:12:25
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. I hear that some agitation in your voice as you begin to talk about this experience, I'm wondering if you can share with me one specific incident, maybe a recent one so I had a better understanding of what you're going through. 

00:12:40
LAURA Lately, I've been, uhm, in Miami, Florida, and as I was setting up a registration table for a conference, I was speaking with the woman (inaudible ) hotel then she had asked me if I was Latino. And then I said, "No, I'm not. I'm Native American and Italian." And she said, "Oh, are you sure? Because you really look like my cousin." And I said, "No, I'm sure. And this is what I've been, and (inaudible ), I've always been." She really kept questioning me if that's what I was. 

00:13:05
MARK KENNEY  Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
LAURA And I just was amazed that she didn't believe me. 

00:13:10
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Yeah. I'd under(ph), you showed amusement. I also get a sense of the frustration and, and aggravation... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
MARK KENNEY ...with having to defend yourself and, ah, I'm just wondering if that really goes to the core of your being. 

00:13:25
LAURA Yeah(ph). It's hard to believe that they're not gonna believe me when I say them something. My parents raised me to know both of my backgrounds, you know, very well, and be very open with them. And I wanna think some really lives(ph) here discovering yourself then you're not. 

00:13:35
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Well, why don't you share with me about how did your parents, ah, raised and, and present this multi-racial identity to you as you were growing up? 

00:13:50
LAURA Since I was little, we always went to cultural events, had family gatherings where almost have little cultural events at them. Uhm, and topic was always open for conversation. We traveled, 'coz half of my family is on, uhm, in the west. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
MARK KENNEY Uhm. 

00:14:05
LAURA (inaudible ) last year so we went back and forth and went to different things there and spent time with my different families. It's just been very open. 

00:14:15
MARK KENNEY Okay. Well, you know, I'm wondering if there's any experience that you can draw from your family of origin or maybe some other past-related experiences that can help you in this current situation. 

00:14:25
LAURA Well, I'm not really sure. I just know that I, I grew up in a very small town and, and everybody knew who we were and they knew what we were, what we were. (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
LAURA  And no one had a problem with it. No one questioned it. No one said anything. And now, people are starting to question me and it's just kind of different and I think it's because it's not what I'm used to. 

00:14:45
MARK KENNEY  Ah, okay. So what I'm hearing from you, this is also of a new experience. People questioning your identity... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
MARK KENNEY ...coming out openly and questioning your identity, uhm, and that's because you'd come from a very supportive, uhm, environment and community where it was really a not issue, and just fully accepted. Then necessarily(ph) in the one case that it was a person of color who was, ah, questioning your identities. So, I'm wondering if, whether the frustration is, is being in an environment where people may have different views about racial identity. 

00:15:15
LAURA Uhm, well, this past incident, yes. It was a person of color but over the years, it's been anybody. I've been pushed by a different types of people, it's not just one group of people that has the issue with it. It can be anybody. 

00:15:30
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. So, again, it, it's sort of you're learning into a new environment and running into this issue about racial identity. That really it didn't exist. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
MARK KENNEY Ah, prior to you stepping out of that community. Now, that you're done with your graduate studies and in your first career position, this has really placed you in an environment where maybe you need some additional knowledge... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
MARK KENNEY  about racial identity and its meaning in our society. I'm wondering if you would be interested in, in looking at any books or articles, ah, possibly use some websites that, ah, provide information on sort of the history or understanding about racial identity in our society. 

00:16:10
LAURA Yeah. That'd be good. Uhm, if I help, some of things it doesn't gonna change over time. 

00:16:15
MARK KENNEY Well, I'd, I'd, I think, you're correct in our observation. Uhm, this is a very difficult topic, ah, for our society and, uhm, as you might know in this last census, we were able to check off as many, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
MARK KENNEY  ah, identities as you would like, which was the first time ever experienced. And so, it does present difficulty for other people, uhm, and for yourself. So, I'm wondering also if, if we can provide, ah, give you some websites that involve, ah, interaction between people with, ah, multi-racial identities and backgrounds and discussing, ah, this topic 'coz sometimes it helps, ah, not to feel so alone. I'm wondering if you'd be interested in seeing if anything resonates with one of those websites for you. 

00:16:55
LAURA Yeah. I mean, great. 

00:16:55
MARK KENNEY  Okay. What would I do is I'll put together this resource list for you for next week and have you take a look at it and again choosing things that resonate for you, ah, that you feel might be beneficial increasing your knowledge level. But that's a whole week away. And, ah, I know you gotta run into this situation, ah, again possibly within our next meeting. So, what do you think you could do right now, ah, to handle this situation? 

00:17:25
LAURA I think the best way is, if I'm approached, explain what I am and it's almost leaving it up to them. I cannot do so much. And if they question and have a problem with it, that's up to them. 

00:17:40
MARK KENNEY Okay. So I'm sort of you hearing that, right here you doing is sort of putting beyond this on the, of the other person... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
MARK KENNEY ...and you only taking control over what you have of yourself and you're helping sense of yourself. 

00:17:50
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
MARK KENNEY And that's nothing but what the best that you can do right now. Uhm, before we end, ah, today though, I would like to find out from you, what is it that you're walking away from or meeting today? What are you taking with you today? 

00:18:00
LAURA  It, being here makes me realize that I know who I am, that's the right thing, and that I don't have a problem with my identity and it's other people's view, and I want to learn more about that so I can deal with them better because they're the ones that have the issue, not me. 

00:18:20
MARK KENNEY Okay. Well, it sounds like you are taking some good points with you to build a good foundation to increase your knowledge. And, and down the road, we can also maybe help you develop some alternative, ah, skills to handle these situations in the future. Great work. We'll see you next week at the same time. 

00:18:35
LAURA Okay. Thanks. 

00:18:35
Vignette #2: Interracial Couple with Child 

00:18:35
MARK KENNEY  Our next vignette is a married interracial couple with a nine-year-old child. Don is 42 years old and White, Irish and Italian. He is looking to advance his career. He is also a devoted husband and father. He feels that this is the time to make the move before his marketability begins to decrease. He works in the computer field. He is very focused on making this move but feels resentful that his spouse is not totally supporting him. The most recent interview offer is from an out of state company, which is far from family and is not a very diverse community. Roberta is 42 years old and Black, African heritage. She is a professional in the financial world. She is also a devoted wife and mother. She understands her husband's career goals but sees a very different outcome for herself and her daughter. She has concerns regarding this move due to the loss of closeness to family, lack of diversity in this other community, and the impact on her daughter. 

00:19:45
MARK KENNEY  Hi, Roberta and Don. At the end of our last session, we began to talk about the possibility of your career opportunity in the interview and I guess I'm wondering if that's where you'd like to start today as a conversation. 

00:20:00
DON  Yeah. I mean, I have a great opportunity with a top company, wonderful money, (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
ROBERTA Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
DON great position and, ah, where to put us, ah, there'd be in fact with the school system for Jasmine(ph). 

00:20:15
MARK KENNEY Don you sound really excited about this opportunity. 

00:20:15
DON Yeah. I can't wait to get out there. I wanna like get there for the interview and start getting... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ROBERTA Honey, listen. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
DON ...some other things up. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ROBERTA Honey, I know that you're very excited about this position. And I know that you were really interested in it. But, you know, what, we haven't even really talked about it. I mean, I have a lot of concerns. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
MARK KENNEY It. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
ROBERTA And, you know, you haven't given me a chance to talk about it. 

00:20:35
MARK KENNEY  It sounds like this is another example of a communication to fulfill that we've been working on in the previous five sessions. Ah, so let me give Roberta a chance to express her concerns. What are your concerns? 

00:20:50
ROBERTA Well, he's talking about moving us across the country to an area where there're hardly any people of color. I mean, he's taking us away from our family, our family and friends, you know, all of those to support us right now. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
ROBERTA It's really great for Jasmine(ph). And I guess, really, I think that he's not really thinking about me... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
ROBERTA ...or thinking about Jasmine. 

00:21:10
MARK KENNEY I see. (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
DON Excuse me. 

00:21:10
MARK KENNEY Don? 

00:21:10
DON  I mean, I am thinking about you. We're talking about financial security. We're talking about having an opportunity to get out there and get set. I know we could get job opportunities for you out there, with your skills a company would snatch you up in a minute. And I'm just, you know, for the record, I am just tired of hearing, you know, I don't think about you and Jasmine, okay? 

00:21:35
MARK KENNEY Okay. It sounds like there were two things are going on here. First of all, you really haven't communicated very well about this and apparently there are some serious disagreements about what are the important factors in making this decision. So, I'm, I'm wondering if you're, ah, be willing to try, ah, an alternative approach to, to look at this issue and, and that is, to look at our, ah, cultural world view and how that impacts on our decision-making process, process. Would that be something that you both be willing to, ah, try to do today? 

00:22:05
DON All right. 

00:22:05
ROBERTA Okay. 

00:22:05
MARK KENNEY Okay. Roberta, let's start with you. Ah, it seems that you're very concerned about diversity in community. Ah, how does your, ah, world view, ah, influence the, the importance of these two elements in your life? 

00:22:20
ROBERTA  Well, I'm very, very concerned about family. Family is the most important thing. I mean, career opportunities are great, but family has to come first, and diversity is important, too. 

00:22:35
MARK KENNEY  Okay. And Don? Ah, how, how does, ah, your cultural background and world view influence your decision about the importance of career advancement in financial security? 

00:22:50
DON Well, I, I don't think it's a cultural thing. I mean, as far as my family, I mean, it's about, ah, getting a good job and being a provider for the family. That, that's what it is. 

00:23:05
MARK KENNEY Uhm, I don't know, uhm, if you're really understanding what I'm saying about, ah, cultural world view. What if I would use the term, ah, "ethnicity?" Uhm, because it doesn't seem, rest assure that you see any cultural influence, so how about we try to consider as if a term? What, what comes to mind when I say that? 

00:23:20
DON  Well, I'm half Irish, half Italian. 

00:23:25
MARK KENNEY And how do you think that has influence, uhm, again your, ah, your beliefs about career, money and family? 

00:23:35
DON Well, the career, I mean, the idea was, you know, you get a good education, get a career, and become financially solid, you're making money. And as for the family aspect of it, you are then the provider. I mean, and then that's what the message was. 

00:23:55
MARK KENNEY Okay. Roberta, let's, ah, let me hear from you in, and how, uhm, is, ah, your family message is. What were there about regarding the same three issues: career, money and, and family? 

00:24:05
ROBERTA  Well, again, family comes first. Family is essential. I mean, you know, we believe that careers are important. Ah, you have to make money to support the family, but that's secondary. (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
MARK KENNEY Uhm. 

00:24:20
ROBERTA I mean, everything evolves around with family and it's also been really important to us to have a connection to the Black community, to keep a connection, and to participate and be a part of that community. 

00:24:35
MARK KENNEY  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So, what I'm hearing here is that there's the real differences in, in the priority of these three values: career, money, and family, they're important. And now, as you shared early in the session, you, you really haven't discussed that, uhm, and taken into account, maybe that there's the, a cultural world view influence in that decision-making process. Uhm, I'm wondering if you're willing to, ah, continue this conversation in preparation for our ne, ah, our next session, ah, in order to, uhm, think about, ah, what are the important, ah, values that are of interest to you and, and of interest to you, ah, your family? 

00:25:15
DON  Yeah, all right, but I'm still just gonna get, I mean, big issue about the diversity in the community and diversity at school for Jasmine. 

00:25:25
ROBERTA  Well, (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ROBERTA Okay(ph). 

00:25:30
ROBERTA of course, you didn't know it. You're not required because you'd never been the only one, the only one in your clan, you know, the only one in your company. I mean, Jasmine has had an opportunity to interact with all kinds of kids who live here. We have family all around us, but can you imagine? No, you can't imagine what it's like for her. If she (inaudible ) to him the only child of color in that class, and you know what else? What I have found out this people who will go very free to let their racism fly, and I don't want that to happen to my daughter. Is that what you want for her? 

00:26:10
DON No, it's not what I wanted for her. I mean, it's, the racism thing. All right, it hasn't been, uhm, on the forefront of my mind. I mean, it's, I haven't thought about a lot of the discussions we had about racism, but, I mean, that's not been... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ROBERTA Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
DON ...at the forefront of my mind. 

00:26:25
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Okay, Well, we're coming to the end of our time, but I think we found some mutual common ground here, a mutual interest and, and that is the impact on Jasmine. What is this going to mean for her? And I'm, I'm wondering if that's the starting point for your conversation about what's important to your family from making this decision, uhm, before accepting an interview and to continue talk about the importance of, ah, your family and Jasmine and the impact, and begin to sort your values out and, and come to this, begin to work on mutual agreement about some common interest with these free values. Would you both be willing to try to work on that for next time? 

00:27:10
DON  Yeah sure. 

00:27:15
ROBERTA Yeah. 

00:27:15
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
ROBERTA Okay. 

00:27:15
MARK KENNEY Okay. I know it might be a difficult thing but, ah, I think it's a worthwhile, and again, to focus on that mutual interest of what's the best interest of your daughter. Thanks for coming in, and we'll see you next week at the time. 

00:27:30
DON Okay. 

00:27:30
Vignette #3: Multi-racial Family (Cross Racial Adoptive) 

00:27:30
MARK KENNEY  This is a session with Deb, Monica and Terry. Deb is a 45-year-old White female who adopted Monica at the age of 2. Monica is now 12 years old. Terry is Deb's 47-year-old live-in partner of 5 years. They live in a rural community that lacks cultural diversity. Counseling began with Deb and Monica and after three sessions, it was decided that Terry should join in the family session as well. Since then, all three have been meeting with the counselor and this is the seventh session. During the last two sessions, much time was spent focusing on Monica's feeling of depression, loneliness, and isolation. Monica notices herself more and more as a Black person now, and has seen the fact that she is different from her mom, her adopted family, and the people that she has grown up with as a negative thing. During this session, the counselor will explore what has been done to address the issue of Monica's racial-cultural heritage as a way of helping her to understand experiences that she might have as a person of African heritage, and as a way of helping her to feel good about herself. 

00:28:50
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  During our last session, we talked about how you, Monica, are beginning to experience yourself more and more as a Black person and how at times you experience a little bit of discomfort around that, is that correct? 

00:29:05
MONICA  Yes. 

00:29:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. We also talked about the possibility of maybe spending this session talking about some possible ideas on how you could become better acquainted with the African-American, ah, heritage that you have and how we could also help you get a little bit more understanding about what that all means. Do you remember that as well? 

00:29:30
MONICA Yeah. 

00:29:30
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Okay. All right. So, what if, during this session, we begin to, ah, strategize, brainstorm, come up with some ideas for, for how we can assist Monica and, ah, better understanding herself in such a way that she begins to feel good about herself. 

00:29:50
TERRY I think that sounds good... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DEB I agree with you. 

00:29:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. All right. Uhm, I recall on our previous session, ah, you talked about an Aunt Betty(ph), was it?

00:30:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. 

00:30:00

DEB And, ah, well I'm still living in Pittsburgh, ah, while we were living together. I took on to visit her... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
DEB ...and then ah, then we moved here. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
DEB And, uhm, I found it out later that, uhm, Betty(ph) became quite ill, (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
DEB and then she died before, uhm, just before Monica's third birthday. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Hmm. 

00:30:25
DEB And. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Okay. All right. So, you really never got to know her at all? 

00:30:30
MONICA  No. 

00:30:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. Do you remember much about her? 

00:30:35
MONICA Not really. 

00:30:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. All right. Uhm, when you're adopted Monica, do the agency that you were involved with, uhm, talked to you at all about, ah, the importance of racial identity and how to help her become a little bit more accustomed, familiar with her racial identity? 

00:30:55
DEB No. They didn't talk to me much about anything in that regard. 

00:31:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. Okay. I do recall though, that, ah, it's probably (sighs) right before, uhm, agencies began to focus on the issues of racial identity development that, ah, trans-racial adopted families? So, okay. Uhm, well, what experiences have you had related to culture and race? Ah, individually and, and, and as a family? 

00:31:25
TERRY  Well, I think, individually, our experiences are quite different because I lived in New York City and took advantage of a lot of culture, (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
TERRY arts, uhm, different things. 

00:31:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm.

TERRY And plus the, the population is just so much more diverse than it is here. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
TERRY  I have a lot of friends with different backgrounds. 

00:31:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Okay. All right. What about you, Deb? Do you have, uhm, any friends, of other background, of other heritages? 

00:31:50
DEB  I, I knew a few African-American women when I lived in Pittsburgh, (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Yeah. 

00:31:55

00:32:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:00
DEB that there's not much diversity in this area. (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
DEB So, uhm, and, and I don't have the same kind of, ah, experiences that she had in New York... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
DEB ...regarding cult, culture and arts. 

00:32:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Uh hmm. Okay. Uh hmm, okay. All right. Ah, what have you done to familiarize yourself with the African-American experience or to promote, help Monica become familiar with the African-American experience? Have you done much of anything related to that? 

00:32:30
DEB No. Terry has been purchasing some books when she gets back to New York and has been ordering some books as well... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
DEB ...that, that uhm, she brought home. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm.

00:32:57
DEB  Music, and some music but not a whole lot. 

00:33:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. So you've attempted to provide some exposure. What about, uhm, taking her to cultural events, uhm, museums, ah, things of that nature? Done any of that? 

00:33:15
DEB None(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
TERRY Never. 

00:33:15

00:34:00
TERRY Who knew somebody, who knew somebody, and we connected that way. 

00:34:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Okay. And I assumed you'd gotten to know her since you've been going and. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
TERRY  Yeah, it, uhm, definitely. I think Monica really enjoy spending time there. 

00:34:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Is that, is that true, Monica? 

00:34:15
MONICA Yes, it's very cool. 

00:34:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay, all right. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
TERRY And she's with a large group of, uhm, Black women. 

00:34:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uhm, okay. Interesting. I'm wondering if you might realize her perhaps as a resource, a resource for, ah, community, events, ah, getting in contact with it, ah, the community. Have you thought about that at all? 

00:34:35
DEB  No. Right(ph). I didn't think about it, but it might be, it might be a good idea. 

00:34:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. 

00:34:40
DEB I have not met the woman, but Terry has talked a lot about her and Monica has always been really happy to talk about her as well. So. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
TERRY I think she could be of very good resource. 

00:34:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Okay, all right. Monica, tell me a little bit more about school. Ah, what's your school like? Ah, is there any diversity at all in the school? I know your in a rural community, but is there any diversity at all in school? 

00:35:05
MONICA  No, not really at all. 

00:35:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. And what's that like for you? How are you treated? 

00:35:15
MONICA After a while, I sort of like used to it, so now, it's not a big deal anymore. 

00:35:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Can you say more about that? What's not a big deal? 

00:35:20
MONICA  It's not a big deal that maybe I'm the only Black person in my school. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
MONICA But, I sort of like used to it after a while so I don't think about it a lot anymore. 

00:35:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uhm. Okay. Let me ask you this. Uhm, you're, you're the only Black child. Are there other children of color in school that you're aware of? 

00:35:40
TERRY Well, I think there's one Hispanic family. 

00:35:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. All right. Okay. So, very, very a little diversity, (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
TERRY Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  is that really? Okay. How open do you perceive a school today? Ah, how interested in being inclusive do you perceive a school today? 

00:36:05
DEB I, I don't, I don't believe that there are people interested in, in that... (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
DEB ...concept. (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
DEB Uhm, and uhm, I've gone to PTA meetings, things like that. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
DEB  It's, they treat Monica like they treat all the other kids. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
DEB You know, I don't think they view her as different... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Hmm. 

00:36:25
DEB ...from anyone. 

00:36:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay. All right. I'd like to come back to that. Uhm, you know, we've talked about a few different things, uhm, and it sounds as though you're, uhm, recognizing the importance of, uhm, all of different kinds of things to that, ah, we mentioned today, uhm, beginning to get involved in some, ah, events, some programs, things of that nature, uhm, going out and, ah, discovering the community a little bit more, uhm, discovering what's in the community a little bit more, (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
TERRY Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY uhm, finding out literature, et cetera that might be able to help you all understand a little bit more. Uhm, I guess I'm wondering how invested are you in perhaps, uhm, helping to educate the school and helping to educate the, ah, school district, perhaps, about what they need to do, uhm, to make students feel more comfortable because, you know, as we know, things are changing. And, uhm, perhaps it's not a diverse of community now, but, you know, who's to say that in, you know, years to come you don't begin to see more families of color, et cetera living into the community. So, anyway(ph), that's what I'm suggesting is that you all might become sort of pioneers, if you will in terms of, uhm, you know, ah, introduces some of these concepts to, to the school. 

00:38:05
TERRY What's(ph) the best website that you could give us? 

00:38:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  I certainly do, and, I can, I can certainly give you, give you that. I also have a book list that... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
TERRY All right. Good. 

00:38:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY ...I can share with you, uhm, but I also have, ah, access to someone who I know, uhm, had, had some information about a support group... (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
TERRY Okay. 

00:38:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY at one time. So, ah, check into that as well. 

00:38:25
TERRY  Great. 

00:38:30
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Monica, how does it all sound to you? 

00:38:30
MONICA It sounds fine to me. I'm looking forward to it. 

00:38:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Okay. 

00:38:35
Vignette #4: Interracial Dating (Individual) 

00:38:35
MARK KENNEY  This is Amy's sixth session. Amy is a 25-year-old White female in an interracial relationship of two years with Michael, a 26-year-old Black male. Their relationship has now reached the serious level. Amy has decided that it is now important to share this with her family, who know about their friendship, but nothing more. She was planning a trip home for the weekend at which point she would be breaking the news to her parents and two brothers. 

00:39:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Hi, Amy. How are you today? 

00:39:20
AMY I'm doing all right. 

00:39:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Good, good. I know you went home for the weekend. (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
AMY Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Ah, how did things go? 

00:39:25
AMY (Sighs) Not, not really well. Uhm, kind of got my thoughts together and knew exactly what I wanted to say to mom and dad, and we sat down. Uhm, I started to present the whole topic of my relationship with Michael. And as soon as mom and dad understood what I was trying to get across and the whole relationship that I share with Michael, they just closed down. They didn't wanna hear about it anymore. Uhm, they told me that my relationship with him was completely unacceptable. And, uhm, (sighs) they told me that, basically, I had to make a choice between either being with my family or being with Michael. 

00:40:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Uh hmm. Well, Amy, that sounds pretty extreme. 

00:40:20
AMY Yeah, it's, you know, I love my family and I guess I never expected them to respond the way that they did, like I thought that they, I knew that they didn't, uhm, really like the topic and they weren't fond of it by, you know, experiences that we had before... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:40
AMY ...and so I thought, you know, this is different... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:40
AMY ...if I present it to them correctly, (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
AMY and they love me so much and, (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
AMY you know, they're gonna totally understand and their gonna, you know, work through this with me and that's not what happened. And, you know, I sit there and I was thinking I just, I love Michael and I just choice(ph) to be in relationship with him, (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
AMY you know, this is what I want. 

00:41:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So you're clear on what you want. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
AMY Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Ah, so where does this leave you? 

00:41:10
AMY I don't know. You know, Michael and I both said that this is what we want for the rest of our lives, that we wanna be in this relationship together, (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
AMY  that we love each other, (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
AMY you know, but, my family is so important to me... (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
AMY ...and they have been there for me through everything. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
AMY  They were my support system. 

00:41:30
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
AMY And I just love them to death and it scares me and it makes me so incredibly sad to know that they're not willing to be there anymore. 

00:41:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So, it's the whole issue of the support and not... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
AMY Hmm. 

00:41:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY ...having their support and, uhm, not knowing what to do in terms of, uhm, how to fit them to come around to the fact that you're happy. 

00:41:55
AMY Yeah. 

00:41:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  And that, uhm, this is good for you. 

00:42:00
AMY Yeah. 

00:42:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tell me how has Michael reacted to all of this? Ah, what was his reaction to, to what you told him about going home? 

00:42:10
AMY  He was destroyed. 

00:42:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
AMY  I mean, he was so disappointed and so upset and so sad... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
AMY ...that, you know, he basically said to me it was like they're making a judgment on my background and they're making a judgment on what I am and not who I am. (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
AMY And they're not accepting me for who I am. They don't even know me. They don't even know anything about me. (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Right. 

00:42:40
AMY You know, (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Right. 

00:42:40
AMY which devastates him and it devastates me. And, then he, uhm, started saying these ridiculous things about how he's to blame and he's to blame for the way my family is treating me... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
AMY ...and the fact that I'm having problems and, you know, and I said to him that, that's so unfair because we're in this together. This is a relationship that we chose being together. 

00:43:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:05
AMY And, you know, I chose to be in it freely and I chose to fall in love with him freely. And I'm not gonna sit here and point fingers at anyone... (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
AMY  and he's not gonna be a person to take blame for how my family's reacting to us being together. 

00:43:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
AMY So. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay. All right. Uhm, I guess I'm wondering about, ah, support systems, other support systems that the two of you have had, uhm, in terms of friends, ah, his family. Uhm, do you have support systems that are... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
AMY No, you know, it's like. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY helpful? 

00:43:45
AMY  I kinda wish that I, uhm, had this silly crystal ball that I could look into and be like help me and show me what the choices are that I'm suppose to make... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
AMY ...and how do I deal with this, (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
AMY and what's the best thing I can do and how do I not offend anyone and how do I love everyone and how they love me and, (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
AMY like, just what can I do basically. And so, I guess, you know, that's not realistic. So, (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
AMY ...I don't know, I, I wish there was something or someone that we could turn to, to be able to help us out in a sense of... (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
AMY ...maybe guide us a little bit, give us a little bit direction. I don't know. 

00:44:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay. I do have some thoughts related to that and I'll come back to that in, in a minute. 

00:44:30
AMY Okay. 

00:44:30
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uhm, what I first wanna threw out a, a question or a comment about, uhm, the security that you and Michael have within yourselves individually and within the relationship. Do you feel that the two of you are secured individually and, and secure the relationship? Does that feel. 

00:44:50
AMY  Yeah. I mean, I do... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
AMY ...but I think that this is really trying our relationship. 

00:44:55
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
AMY I think that it's, you know, it's making me questioned big time, like, (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Yeah. 

00:45:00
AMY  I have to make a choice and I'm gonna give up everything that I had in the past... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
AMY ...and everything that I know. 

00:45:10
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Right. 

00:45:10
AMY So, is this, you know, not to make a sound because I know what is worth, but is it worth it? Or we can be able to do this together, (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
AMY or we can be able to work together and stay in a strong relationship like we have... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
AMY ...because, you know, some people, it's just, I guess you could say it's hard because it's really a lot of pressure on us. 

00:45:25
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
AMY You know? 

00:45:30
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY Uh hmm. And society doesn't make it easy. 

00:45:30

Vignette #5: Interracial Couple 

00:49:05
MARK KENNEY  This is the second session with Miguel, a 29-year-old Mexican-American man, born in Mexico, who came to the U.S. with his family at the age of five. He has been married to Connie for a year and a half. Connie is a 25-year-old first generation American woman of Vietnamese heritage. The two have been struggling with gender-role differences since the beginning of their marriage. 

00:49:40
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY  Okay. So Miguel, you are a computer technician, is that correct? 

00:49:50
MIGUEL That's correct. 

00:49:50
DR. KELLEY R. KENNEY All right. And I think I have this right that you and Connie have been struggling with this issue of Connie wanting to start a business outside of the home and, and work outside of the home. Ah, that's correct? 

00:50:05
CONNIE Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
MIGUEL That's, that's correct. 

00:50:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. Uhm, can you let, two of you tell me a little more about what the struggle has been about for both of you around this issue? 

00:50:10
MIGUEL  Well, I think that when we got married... (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
MIGUEL ...it was understood that I would be the major breadwinner. And that, ah, perhaps within a year, mere a half spin that ah, we wanted to venture off and start a family. 

00:50:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:50:30
MIGUEL So, ah, her wanting to go ahead and work. 

00:50:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
MIGUEL It kinda threw me off, because as I said we understood I will be the major breadwinner. (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
MIGUEL I recently got a promotion. 

00:50:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
MIGUEL I make good enough money to, uhm, hold us over... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
MIGUEL And I think that, ah, she was to go ahead and work, perhaps, maybe it would stumble our plans of, of starting a family. 

00:50:50
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm, uh hmm. Okay. All right. Connie? 

00:50:55
CONNIE I disagree with that. Uhm, I didn't realize that it was known that he was going to be the breadwinner. 

00:51:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm, okay. 

00:51:05
CONNIE Uhm, you know, I just, I am very independent. He's always known that. (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
CONNIE You know, I like to do things... (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
MIGUEL Sometimes too independent. 

00:51:10
CONNIE ...for myself. 

00:51:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. Okay. 

00:51:10
CONNIE Well, I like to do things for myself. I don't like to rely on other people for anything. 

00:51:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
CONNIE You know, it's like you can't wait around. 

00:51:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm, okay. 

00:51:20
CONNIE So. (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay, all right. Ah, I'm hearing here, as well, that there were some expectations. Ah, perhaps, on both of your parts when you went into the marriage. Is that correct? 

00:51:35
CONNIE Yeah. 

00:51:35
MIGUEL That's correct. 

00:51:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY All right, uhm, why don't we spend sometime first talking about those expectations uhm, I'm also going to want to talking a little bit about how the expectations, uhm, work in terms of, you know, what you expected from her and be on the fact that she is, ah, Vietnamese heritage and what. Your expectations were perhaps of him as a uhm, uhm, man of Mexican heritage. So, uhm, talk to me a little about what those expectations were. 

00:52:10
MIGUEL Well, I, I expected a wife... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
MIGUEL A loving wife. 

00:52:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:52:15
MIGUEL A loving home. 

00:52:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
MIGUEL Uhm, meals to be provided when I come home from work. 

00:52:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. 

00:52:20
MIGUEL Uhm, everything nice and tidy. 

00:52:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
MIGUEL uhm, I didn't expect a, a stereotypical, stay at home and, and be pregnant and barefoot and that's not what I'm asking. 

00:52:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. Okay. 

00:52:30
MIGUEL I'm comfortable with, ah, how our marriage is working out and growing up, my mother was to stay-at-home parent. 

00:52:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:52:40
MIGUEL She provided the meals. 

00:52:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
MIGUEL She raised eight kids. 

00:52:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
MIGUEL My dad had a full-time job. 

00:52:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:52:45
MIGUEL So, that's, that worked. 

00:52:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
MIGUEL  And, I, I hope that it continues to work... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
MIGUEL ...even in our marriage now. 

00:52:50
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay, All right. Connie? 

00:52:55
CONNIE I think that works for his family but that certainly didn't work for mine. 

00:53:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:53:00
CONNIE 'Coz my mother was miserable. My father doesn't really provide for the family, and she stay home and she took care of our, you know, my brothers and my sisters and I. 

00:53:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
CONNIE She was miserable. 

00:53:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
CONNIE He dictated everything and expected everything, because he thought... (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
CONNIE ...he made the moneys so he can rule the house. 

00:53:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
CONNIE  And, I, you know, I do not agree with that. And I vowed that I would not have that happen to me when I got married. 

00:53:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
CONNIE I intentionally choose to be independent, in the way that I am... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
CONNIE ...because I don't wanna rely, I don't wanna, you know, thinking that they can dictate to me, because they feel that they, you know, or maybe might or might not to say that he's doing that. But, I, I will not even to give the chance for that to happen. 

00:53:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, okay. 

00:53:45
CONNIE So. 

00:53:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY All right. 

00:53:45
MIGUEL I'm not taking her freedom away. 

00:53:50
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:50
MIGUEL I think there comes certain boundaries and limitations, ah, so as a wife, I, I, I expected to be a submissive and yet loving wife. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
CONNIE Hmm. 

00:54:00
MIGUEL ah, met my needs as well as I met her needs. 

00:54:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Let me ask for another question here. Uhm, again, you're both of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Ah, and certainly what I'm hearing is that culture does play a part, uhm, as we would expect that it would, it would play a part. I don't know a whole lot about, uhm, roles and expectations, gender role and expectations, uhm, within either one of your cultures. And, uhm, I'm a little bit concern how much information the two of you have with regard to, uhm, each others culture, and, and the norms and expectations around gender. So, if I can maybe, ah, have you both talk a little bit about your knowledge of uhm, and your, your information about the world view, ah, of Vietnamese ah, individuals and your world view about a Mexican individuals. And, and how, how gender roles are seen. How gender roles were viewed, you know, perhaps you can maybe even give me some information about messages that you heard, ah, in your families, ah, about gender roles and, and expectations. 

00:55:20
CONNIE  Well, my mother... (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
CONNIE ...said that she hated the lifestyle that she had... (crosstalk) 

00:55:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:55:30
CONNIE ...with my father. They were very, they did have lack of communication between them. (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:55:35
CONNIE And she told me that, you know, they came to the United States... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
CONNIE  to start a family because she wanted her children... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
CONNIE ...to have a better life... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. Okay. 

00:55:45
CONNIE ...and to have choices... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
CONNIE ...that she didn't have. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:55:45
CONNIE  And, and that's obviously what I'm doing, I'm doing why, you know, taking active watch. She advises me. She wanted me to have the choice that she didn't have, growing up. 

00:55:55
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay, because a part of her gender world view was that she didn't have choices... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
CONNIE No, no, yeah. 

00:56:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY ...as a woman. Uhm, there were expectations that she would be submissive... (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
CONNIE Yeah. 

00:56:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY ...perhaps, and stay at home and ah, provide for the family, that was it, is that, is that correct? (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
CONNIE Yeah, that they have read that way. 

00:56:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay. 

00:56:15
CONNIE He said that was the way it was. 

00:56:15
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:56:15
CONNIE And, in, in, in our country men will not to have more than one wife. 

00:56:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:56:20
CONNIE I think this is suppose to be okay. 

00:56:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:56:25
CONNIE You know, (crosstalk) 

00:56:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY I see. 

00:56:25
CONNIE you're not to say anything, and I, I refuse to be that way. That's not the way that I am. 

00:56:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  I see, okay. I hear that. Miguel, what about in your family? What was some of the messages that you heard, ah, about gender and, and gender roles? 

00:56:40
MIGUEL Well for one, ah, education, let's just say for example education. 

00:56:45
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
MIGUEL Uhm, it, it was not, ah, ah, given that, ah, beyond high school... (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
MIGUEL ...uhm, females were to pursue that herself. 

00:56:55
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
MIGUEL And she's a very intelligent... (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
MIGUEL ...ah, a female who, you know, who I admire. (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
MIGUEL Uhm, but at this point, it was a given again, (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
MIGUEL and, and same to her culture to that, ah, the man is the head of the household. (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:57:10
MIGUEL Uhm, female were to, ah, be submissive... (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. 

00:57:10
MIGUEL ...and, and ah, provide that, ah, so, uhm, it's a little bit an old school that I, I struggle with (inaudible ) ah, I think it has always worked in my family. (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
MIGUEL Uhm, and I try to instill in our marriage the same morals and, and, ah, relations and things like that, (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
MIGUEL that, ah, had worked with my mother and father. 

00:57:35
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm. You just mentioned your mother and I, I know in our first session, uhm, you indicated that being very, ah, very closed, very attached to your mother. And, uhm, I think that too might have, ah, perhaps, played a part, in terms of your expectations, is that correct as well? 

00:58:00
MIGUEL That's correct, again even the fact that I didn't marry someone... (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
MIGUEL ...of Mexican background. 

00:58:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:58:05
MIGUEL So, I'm very close to my mother now and that(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
MIGUEL Uhm, so she, she's not of used to this whole liberation, freedom, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
MIGUEL hear me out, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
MIGUEL so, (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
MIGUEL  this is all new to her so it's very difficult for me to sometimes try to educate her, as well. 

00:58:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. Okay, all right. Okay, so a lot of things are going on again with regard to culture and, ah, expectations that you had, uhm, Connie, for the type of person, uhm, that you would marry, ah, who will be totally different from your dad, and, ah, for you, Miguel, it sounds like, you know, again, you have these expectations that uhm, whoever you married, ah, whether it will be a Mexican or a woman of another culture and background, that, you know, still she would uhm, maintain her particular, ah, stance and particular role and, and that would just be how things would be. Uhm, I'm wondering in view of now what we know about ah, the role that culture plays in ah, this whole struggle. Whether or not we can, perhaps, work together to come to some type of resolution, ah, and, and come to some compromise ah, so that the two of you, you know, you're starting your own family. Uhm, you're gonna be starting your own practices, ah, your own way of doing things. That is perhaps, going to be a very different from, ah, what you both grew up with, uhm, for what your parents did. Uhm, do you think it's possible for us to, to work on some compromise? 

01:00:10
MIGUEL I, I still think we have a lot to work out. 

01:00:15
CONNIE Yeah. We have a lot of issues. 

01:00:15
MIGUEL Uhm, it's gonna, I'll be honest with you, it's very difficult. 

01:00:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
MIGUEL Uhm, I'm used to my right(ph). 

01:00:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
MIGUEL  Uhm, so, uhm, I don't know. 

01:00:25
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
MIGUEL I don't know where this is going to lead us through or. (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Hmm. Okay, okay. Does having a better understanding of where each one of you was coming from, from a cultural standpoint, help clear the air a little bit? Does it help you to understand each other a little bit better? 'Coz that's really, I think, the first thing that we need to, ah, focus on. You know, once the two of you have a better understanding from where each other's coming from on this issue, then I think, we can begin to, to, to work on the, the compromise. Do, do you have at least a better understanding, (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
MIGUEL Hmm. 

01:01:05
DR. KELLEY KENNEY  someone of a better understanding? 

01:01:10
MIGUEL A little bit. 

01:01:10
CONNIE You know, I, I would say a little bit, but I don't know, I just don't know how we're gonna be able to work it out, being that he wants things his way. 

01:01:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:20
CONNIE So... (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Uh hmm. Well, I guess I'm wondering is that what I'm hearing that you expect the things are going to be your way and, ah, there's no room for, for compromise here, Miguel? 

01:01:35
MIGUEL  Let's just say, it, it's gonna be a struggle. 

01:01:40
DR. KELLEY KENNEY Okay a struggle to let go of.

Vignette #6: Cross-Racial Adopted Individual 

01:02:05
MARK KENNEY  This session is with Josh. He is a 20-year-old first year college student at a large and diverse university. He was adopted at the age of 10 from Vietnam by parents of European culture. He grew up in a community in which he did not have any exposure to people of Vietnamese heritage. He recently had two experiences on campus regarding the questioning of his identity by both non-Asian and Asian students. This caused great distress for him. He comes to counseling to begin to sort out his identity concerns and reactions to these recent experiences. This is our first session. 

01:02:50
MARK KENNEY  Hi, Josh. I'm Mark Kenney, one of the Counselors here at the Counseling Center. And, ah, I see that you've completed all the paperwork that you need... (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
JOSH Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
MARK KENNEY ...in regards to confidentially I also have a message here from our intake Counselor that ah, explains that, ah, you came in today to talk about 2 distressing events that occurred on your campus. Uhm, so, I'd like to start there and I'm wondering which one you'd like to start with. 

01:03:15
JOSH How about with the one at the library? 

01:03:20
MARK KENNEY Okay. 

01:03:20
JOSH Uhm, one night I had to stay up late to study for my math exam and on the way back to my dorm, and there was a group of drinkers... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
JOSH ...and one of them step out and make some kind of Kung-fu move and, and I just, I just confuse and asked him, why doing that? What's up with that? 

01:03:40
MARK KENNEY Uh-huh. 

01:03:40
JOSH  And he asked me, "What's wrong, don't you know Kung-fu and don't all Chinese knew Kung-fu?" and I was just confused and. 

01:03:50
MARK KENNEY  To find a shocking experience here is surprising, first of all, he just come out of nowhere to be, you know, in the sense verbally attack that way. And then, ah, adding to your confusion about who you were and making assumptions and, ah, may, maybe help me understand, ah, your sense of your Asian identity. 

01:04:10
JOSH Well, I knew that I adopt, I, I was adopted from Vietnam and uhm, but my parents never teach me anything about my culture, my country. 

01:04:25
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
JOSH Uhm. 

01:04:25
MARK KENNEY  So, what I'm hearing... (crosstalk)

01:04:40
MARK KENNEY Okay. 

01:04:40
JOSH That's their point of view. 

01:04:40
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Okay, so in a sense you really don't have a sense of an, an Asian identity much less of Vietnamese identity, uhm, now, you have been confronted in this environment with that. Uhm, tell me more about home community in regards to identity. Help me better understand on what happened that night. What's with like at home growing up? 

01:05:05
JOSH Uhm, I was grow up in the small town of Upstate and, uhm, everybody knows everybody. 

01:05:10

01:05:10
JOSH Uhm, all the, all the time I thought I was White. 

01:05:15
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm.

JOSH Which is, nobody is saying that stuff to me before. 

01:05:20

01:05:25
JOSH  Yeah, that kind of stuff. 

01:05:30
MARK KENNEY Uh-huh, uh-huh. So, I hear you're saying is, is that sort of how you see yourself on the inside. And this, ah, confrontation really brought up, ah, an issue for you about how you proceed on the outside. How does that make you feel that those, this is sort of him pointed to me, that you feel one-way inside that, that people treating you different on the outside? How does it make you feel right now? 

01:05:50
JOSH I was okay before, but now, that, people see me as Asian, as Chinese people. 

01:06:00
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:00
JOSH I, I don't know what am I suppose to be. 

01:06:05
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. So, this is one of the distressors that have surfaced for you that brought you in the CS today? I'm, I'm wondering being first session, I'm also interested in the second situation too, so I can help, helps me formulate maybe some goals we can set later on. What, what is the second event that occurred around the same issue, that seemed like? 

01:06:25
JOSH Well it seems that first, uhm, incident happened, uhm, two weeks ago I was, ah, attending the, ah, Vietnamese New Year, ah, in campus. 

01:06:35
MARK KENNEY Uh-huh. 

01:06:35
JOSH I was fascinated with, ah, singers and dancers. 

01:06:40
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
JOSH So, I decided to stay after the party to hang around. There was one Vietnamese student came up to me and asked me something with his language, and I couldn't understand it. 

01:06:50
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:50
JOSH  He's get mad. (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
MARK KENNEY (inaudible ) Vietnamese... (crosstalk) 

01:06:57
JOSH Yes. 

01:06:57
MARK KENNEY Ah, okay. 

01:06:57
JOSH But then, I was embarrassed because I wouldn't understand what he is saying. He's, he was using his language, which is my own language. 

01:07:05
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:05
JOSH  But lucky me he was, he, he can speak some English. 

01:07:10
MARK KENNEY  Ah, okay. 

01:07:15
JOSH So, uhm, he invited me to join, uhm, the rest of his group. 

01:07:20
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. And, and what did that make you feel? How did you feel about that? 

01:07:25
JOSH At first is, is like I feel "Wow, this guy, at least somebody can, can speak English," but then I feel, why is this, is this happen? 

01:07:35
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:35
JOSH It shouldn't be no exception. I feel like he have to make this kind of exception for me. 

01:07:40
MARK KENNEY Hmm. 

01:07:40
JOSH Uhm, it shouldn't be this way. 

01:07:40
MARK KENNEY  How, how should it be? 

01:07:45
JOSH Well, he's speaking his language, my language, I'm suppose to understand it. (crosstalk) 

01:07:50
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:50
JOSH I should be one of them. 

01:07:50
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:50
JOSH  I should fit in with them. 

01:07:55
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Hmm, but what do you mean by fitting in? 

01:07:55
JOSH  Well, I should, not exactly that I am, I, I do look like them. 

01:08:05
MARK KENNEY Uh-huh. 

01:08:05
JOSH I want to, to act like them and talk like them. 

01:08:10
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. How, and how, and how do you try to address these issues since that event took place? 

01:08:15
JOSH Well, since that I just, I can't find myself, uhm, trying to focus on learning how they act and how they, how they, uhm, joke around. 

01:08:30
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
JOSH Uhm, I even follow them around campus. 

01:08:35
MARK KENNEY Hmm. 

01:08:35
JOSH I even changed my style and my fashion. Why? 

01:08:40
MARK KENNEY Hmm. 

01:08:40
JOSH I don't know. 

01:08:40
MARK KENNEY Okay. So that, that sort of brings you in today, is, is there is this discretion about identity. And I'm hearing two, two struggles here. On, ah, one level you're kinda struggling with, with, with the majority of college students struggle with at this point. And that's the idea of a, basic identity, you know, who am I? You know, I've, I've come from, ah, another place. I spent 18 years or so there. And, ah, ah, ah, this opportunity kinda sort that out. So, to try on, you know, different suits and see what fits and doesn't fit. So, I'm hearing that one level but on the second layer, I'm hearing more about culture identity. Ah, these two incidences have kind of race this issue about being Asian, ah, the one group, being non-Asian sort of stereotyping you and, and misidentifying your heritage. And, and on the second, ah, you know, event you're, ah, not going, you fit in with, with people who are Vietnamese. And this is really create a confusion for you, ah. Is that, ah, I'm wondering, is that a good summation of what, ah, I've heard so far today? 

01:09:45
JOSH Yes, exactly. 

01:09:45
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm, okay. Well, I think the first, I can assist you with, and that is, ah, we can take time, ah, together during the semester and look at, you know, how did you construct the identity that you have ah, right now, from home, family, community, past friends, ah, you know, how that's constructed. And at the same time, we'll, we'll take a look at, ah, examining, ah, the Vietnamese side of yourself. Ah, and, ah, try to develop the meaning and understanding for yourself. Ah, I'm wondering, ah, if you have any ideas of a, of a way or ways that maybe we can start doing that for yourself? 

01:10:20
JOSH Remember that student who were asking me in his language, uhm, he seems to really understand the situation, so I guess I can start for being with him. I can ask him to, ah, help me. 

01:10:35
MARK KENNEY Okay, so he, he's, he, he's someone you feel comfortable with sand safe with to, ah, to try that? 

01:10:40
JOSH Yes. 

01:10:40
MARK KENNEY Okay. And that might be a better idea than trying to do a whole group. Sometimes, it's easier to start in a small or piecely(ph) that, with one individual. Uhm, I'm thinking today, I believe that the advisor for that Vietnamese student group, is, ah, sociology professor. I believe she's also a Vietnamese, is with ah, she'd be someone that you'll be comfortable talking to? 

01:11:00
JOSH Uhm, at this point, I don't think I'm comfortable to come to her yet, so I will start out with my friends first and see what happen. 

01:11:05
MARK KENNEY  Okay, so it's always safe to work with somebody your own age and maybe we can use her as a future reference as, as we go along in our future resource. 

01:11:15
JOSH I, I would rather have him(ph). 

01:11:15
MARK KENNEY Okay, uhm, other thing comes to mind for me as maybe helpful is, is that there are, fortunately, there are a lot of books and articles of resources out there about individuals who've gone through the same experience that you have. Uhm, not necessarily being raised in a family that, that acknowledge ah, all of who they are. I wonder if you'll be interest in, if I put a list together to look at that and see if any can resonate with you that we could, you know, take a look at, read and discuss during our meetings. 

01:11:45
JOSH That'll be great. It's, it's, I think it's perfect. 

01:11:50
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. Okay and this answer(ph) me too that there some, ah, also website and chatrooms, I know for your age group. Sometimes that's a good way to connect with people and to gain some knowledge and understanding, ah, on this topic. Would you be interested in doing that? 

01:12:05
JOSH Oh, sure. 

01:12:05
MARK KENNEY Okay. Well, uhm, I'll put out list together for you, and, ah, in the meantime, maybe you can make that contact with that one student. And, ah, uhm, I think the important thing is that, what is that you're taking away from our session today? 

01:12:20
JOSH Well, I guess (clear throat), excuse me, I'm trying too hard. 

01:12:25
MARK KENNEY Hmm. 

01:12:25
JOSH So learning something shouldn't take, one day, I guess I have to relax and, and, charge and load it by. 

01:12:35
MARK KENNEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:35
JOSH Take it easy. 

01:12:35
MARK KENNEY  Okay, that sounds like a good first start. You just need to, to slow down and have some patience with yourself and, and, ah, I know that you're working on the issue, and that you have a good question in mind. Sometimes that's the most important thing, is the question. So, we'll, we'll start with that but at the same time, I think, maybe your next session ah, we may wanna may look at processing some of your feelings regarding that first incident. And I just don't want that one to slide by us either. So, ah, would you be available at the ah, same time, ah, next week? 

01:13:05
JOSH Sure. 

01:13:05
MARK KENNEY Okay, Josh. I'll now look forward to seeing you then. Thanks. 

01:13:10
JOSH All right. Thank you. 

01:13:10
MARK KENNEY  The Vignettes that you have just seen were examples of some of the actual situations that Inter-racial couples, multiracial individuals and multiracial families experience, and are likely to present when coming in for counseling. It is important to keep in mind that individuals are unique. And that variables are factors that might exist for each individual, couple or family may be different. We hope that these demonstrations have raised your awareness and given you an understanding of the issues and concerns that members of this society may face. And provided you with greater knowledge of the things you may need to consider when counseling members of this population.
