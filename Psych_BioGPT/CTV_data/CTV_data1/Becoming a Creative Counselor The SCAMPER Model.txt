SCAMPER Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888 - 505 - 5576 Email: info@emicrotraining.com Website: www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates presents Becoming Creative as a Counselor: The SCAMPER Model Â© 2007 Featuring: Samuel T. Gladding 

00:00:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The profession of counseling revolves around helping clients in all ages, stages, and backgrounds in life. Make choices and changes that lead to wellness and health. All professional helpers make use of a number of theories and skills in the process. They employ their own creativity at times, too. This video examines what creativity is and how it can be used in counseling. Particular attention is devoted to what is known as the "Scamper Model," which was originally devised by an educator, Robert Eberly. So, what is creativity? There are over 200 definitions of creativity. The one used here directly applies to counseling. Creativity in counseling is the arranging and rearranging of cognitions, emotions, and or behaviors so that something both new and productive results. One way of thinking about this definition of creativity is through the story of the truck driver who was driving through the mountains and every now and then would get out of his cab and beat on the side of his truck. Then, he would get calmly back into his cab and proceed driving. When asked by a person who witnessed him displaying this behavior a number of times, the driver explained his actions. This truck has the capacity to haul up to 2,000 pounds, he said, "I have 4,000 pounds of canaries in it. Therefore, I have to pound on the truck at regular times in order to keep half of the birds in the air at all times." The point is, that the truck driver had enough, found a novel and productive way to keep his load from becoming too heavy and to reach his destination. That is the sign of a creative mind. Someone who can do something new and practical as necessity dictates or opportunity presents. Most of our clients have circumstances like that of the trucker. Where they have heavy loads even an over capacity. In the midst of their lives, they're seeking balance and trying to achieve goals simultaneously. It is at this moments they could particularly use our assistance especially in a creative way. So, how do we help our clients become more creative? And how do we generate creativity in counseling? One way is through employing a mnemonic device called "Scamper" to aid us in remembering how to bring forth the novel and the practical. I will highlight each letter here and how it can be used. 

00:03:40
SCAMPER S 

00:03:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "S" in the Scamper Model stands for substitute, to have a person or thing, act or serve in place of another. By looking for something to substitute, you can often come up with a new idea and a better way of living. For example, you can substitute applesauce for butter. In counseling, you can substitute silence for talking or you can substitute small groups for large groups. 

00:04:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING For this particular activity, we're going to have you practice a substitution. We're gonna have you practice substituting words in the song, "Mary had a little lamb." And I'd like for you to take the first couplet of that song or nursery rhyme and to substitute in different words. So, Metoka what do you think you would substitute in for Mary had a little lamb it's fleece was quite, white as snow. 

00:04:50
METOKA WELCH I will say Mary really had to cram, she did not study the exam. 

00:04:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Wow. (laugh) Okay. Quite a different meaning. 

00:05:00
METOKA WELCH Yes. 

00:05:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING What do you think you would substitute, Melissa? 

00:05:05
MELISSA WILLIAMS Hmm. Terry had to get in before he travel to Japan. 

00:05:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Wow. (laughs) Okay. It fit right in. And Karver, what would you substitute? 

00:05:15
KARVER BOLTON Uhm, how about Larry was an older man his beard was white as snow. 

00:05:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Great. It could have been Santa Claus or something, right? 

00:05:25
KARVER BOLTON Yes, sir. Yes, sir. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Good. Well, that's a fairly silly substitution. Let's do one that has more relevance for counseling. This time, Metoka, I'd like for you and Melissa to have a conversation. And Metoka, I'd like for you to come up with the problem and Melissa for the first three times in the conversation, I'd like for you to use the word, "Yes, but" every time ah, Metoka pauses. 

00:05:55
MELISSA WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:05:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Okay? 

00:06:00
METOKA WELCH Alright(ph). 

00:06:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, let's try it. 

00:06:00
METOKA WELCH Melissa, I really want to travel. 

00:06:05
MELISSA WILLIAMS Yes, but you're in graduate school. You don't have time to travel. 

00:06:05
METOKA WELCH  I know but it would just be so fun to discover other places and see new things. 

00:06:10
MELISSA WILLIAMS  Yes, but right now you really don't have the money to do that, Metoka. 

00:06:15
METOKA WELCH I know but, I mean, I'm sure I can get money from somewhere like student loans or something. 

00:06:20
MELISSA WILLIAMS Yes, but the last thing you wanna do is going into debt over a travel. 

00:06:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Let's stop right there and this time let's substitute a different kind of phrase. Instead of saying "Yes, but," this time uhm, Melissa, I would like for you to say "Yes and." 

00:06:40
MELISSA WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:06:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay? Let's try it again. 

00:06:45
METOKA WELCH Okay. Melissa, I really wanna travel. 

00:06:45
MELISSA WILLIAMS  Yes and can you tell me some more about that? 

00:06:50
METOKA WELCH Sure, it'll be so interesting just to leave the country and we'll see new places and meet new people. 

00:06:55
MELISSA WILLIAMS Yes and that would be such an experience right now for you. 

00:07:00
METOKA WELCH It would, it would be so completing and it is so fulfilling for me. 

00:07:05
MELISSA WILLIAMS Yes and what else, where do you think you will go? 

00:07:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Let me stop you right there before you go somewhere. (laughs) Karver, you've observed what happened here. What's your observation on it? 

00:07:15
KARVER BOLTON Well, it seems like that second time they're very much in cooperation and the energy was just so different because uhm, they were talking to each other and there is a conversation instead of, where the first time it was almost felt like an argument. 

00:07:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. So, it facilitated the conversation rather than stopping it. 

00:07:35
KARVER BOLTON That's right. 

00:07:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. Well, there're advantages and disadvantages to ah, substituting. One of the drawbacks is that the original may or what you substitute may not be as good as the original. However, the other thing that you want to be aware of is that ah, sometimes you can substitute things in and you get much better conversation or much healthier ways of ah, taking care of yourself and it works to your advantage. 

00:08:10
SCAMPER C 

00:08:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "C" in Scamper stands for combine. To bring together, to unite, to achieve a different product or process or to enhance synergy. There are a lot of examples of people or products combining in our society. For example, some products bring together two different elements like peanut butter and chocolate such as this in recess ah, peanut butter cup. Other times, we find that athletes or artists bring together their different movements in a way that enhances either the dance or the performance on the athletic field. 

00:09:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  For this particular activity, we're going to be doing two different experiences. The first one, I'm going to ask you to do is to take the nursery rhyme that we looked at in the first example for substitution that is "Mary had a little lamb." And I want you to do three things with that. The first thing I want you to do and this will all be combining different elements together, is to hum "Mary had a little lamb." Let's do that just kind of together. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Okay. This time let's hum and let's clap. Ready? One, two, three. 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  This time let's hum, clap, and stomp our feet. Okay? Ready. We're combining everything. Ready. One, two, three. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Well, now, that we've hummed and clapped and stomped I've uhm, wonder what you noticed was different when we ah, combined those things. Metoka, what do you noticed? 

00:10:30
METOKA WELCH I noticed that each time we combined something I had to concentrate a little bit more because it got slightly more complicated. 

00:10:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Right. Melissa? 

00:10:40
MELISSA WILLIAMS It seemed to be more energetic as well. Other group member seemed to get more involved. 

00:10:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. Kimberly? 

00:10:45
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  As we added different elements it actually became louder. 

00:10:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. So, there were really was a change from just doing ah, a hum to combining it with a clap and a stomp. 

00:11:00
METOKA WELCH Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Yeah. Well, that's one illustration. Let's do one that's more relevant to counseling. This particular experience is called "one, two, three" and it goes like this. You take and I'll do this in reverse order. You take three people which we have right here. You ask each one to ah, write down two different ideas on a paper to a problem passing that around and you ask them to do it with just a one, in, in a one-minute time frame. We don't have time to quite do that as you might, as we might ideally do but let's pass the clipboard around which you would normally be writing on and just verbally say what we would ah, say in regard to ah, the problem that's come, that we've come up with. Metoka, I think you have the problem that we're going to ah, look at. 

00:12:00
METOKA WELCH Yes. 

00:12:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And what's that? 

00:12:00
METOKA WELCH We were trying, we were talking about how we could be better counselors. 

00:12:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, the problem is how can we be better counselors? 

00:12:10
METOKA WELCH Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And so, if you were writing down your thoughts and just two ideas about that within a one-minute time span, what might you write? 

00:12:20
METOKA WELCH I think I would say that I could be a better listener and also provide more empathy for the client. 

00:12:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. And Melissa? 

00:12:30
MELISSA WILLIAMS I could focus on reflection of feeling and also reflection of meaning and I could also listen to the feedback that my professors gave me. 

00:12:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. And Kimberly? 

00:12:40
KIMBERLY REGENNAS I could watch tapes uhm, counseling sessions and uhm, look for areas to improve as well as get uhm, the input of supervision on areas to improve. 

00:12:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, here in just a few minutes, we have come up with six ideas of how to become a better counselor and with, because we've combined our thoughts and normally we would have written those down on the clipboard so you can see what a powerful force combining ideas or processes can be. A question we always have to ask in this particular exercise or in the whole ah, process of combining is, am I combining what really needs to be combined? Do I, ah, the people, the products, other components, can I combine this? Or they better left ah, by themselves. Do I get more synergy or less synergy ah, in making a combination. A drawback is that we may over combine things that we may multitask and when we do that we get less not more of ah, a product or a process. 

00:13:55
SCAMPER A 

00:13:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "A" in Scamper stands for adapt or alter. That means to adjust for the purpose of suiting a certain condition. For example, we adjust or alter our roles in life such as when we might become spouses or partners with others. We also adapt or, an attitude in life such as "I'm okay" or "One day at a time" or "I'm not perfect but I am responsible." 

00:14:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  For this particular ah, illustration, we're going to read a poem and put that poem into action. This is a poem by Portia Nelson entitled "Autobiography in Five Short Chapters." Usually, it's just read and sometimes people get it into their minds but here we're going to adapt and alter it to a drama. So, Kimberly is going to read the poem, Karver is going to be the producer, director and uhm, get the action going, and Metoka is going to be our actress who literally acts out the poem as Kimberly reads it. So, let's go and do this. Okay, Kimberly? 

00:15:25
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  Autobiography in Five Short Chapters by Portia Nelson. Chapter one. 

00:15:35
KARVER BOLTON Chapter one, action. 

00:15:35
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  I walked down the street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk, I fall in. 

00:15:45
METOKA WELCH Oh! 

00:15:45
KIMBERLY REGENNAS I'm lost. I'm helpless. It isn't my fault. It takes forever to find the way out. 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:00
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  Chapter two. 

00:16:05
KARVER BOLTON Chapter two, action. 

00:16:10
KIMBERLY REGENNAS I walk down the same street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see it. I fall again. I can't believe I'm in the same place but, it isn't my fault. It still takes a long time to get out. 

00:16:35
[sil.] 

00:16:35
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  Chapter three. 

00:16:40
KARVER BOLTON Chapter three, action. 

00:16:40
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  I walk down the same street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it is there. I still fall in. It's a habit. My eyes are open. I know where I am. It is my fault. I get out immediately. Chapter four. 

00:17:10
KARVER BOLTON  Chapter four, action. 

00:17:15
KIMBERLY REGENNAS I walk down the same street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I walk around it. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:25
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  Chapter five. 

00:17:30
KARVER BOLTON Chapter five, action. 

00:17:30
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  I walk down another street. 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Great, great. Let's talk about that for just a moment. Metoka, how was that for you as being the actress who was acting out those words? 

00:17:55
METOKA WELCH It was very frustrating for me doing the same thing over and over again. 

00:18:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. Karver? 

00:18:05
KARVER BOLTON Uhm, while I was watching it was the same thing it, it felt frus, felt frustrating just watching it and it was nice to see her actually finally changed. 

00:18:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Uh hmm. And Kimberly what do you observe? 

00:18:15
KIMBERLY REGENNAS Likewise, I felt very frustrated just repeating and saying the same thing over again. 

00:18:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. So, doing the same thing over there was no learning taking place and it was very frustrating. I think this illustrates that if we do make some changes in life, we do get something different. The drawback though to adapting and to altering is that sometimes people just don't want to do it and they just keep repeating what they've done before. 

00:18:45
SCAMPER M 

00:18:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The M in Scamper stands for modify, that is to change the form of something. We do that in usually two ways. One of those ways is that we magnify what's before us, that is we take a situation and enlarge it, maybe taking a problem to the point of absurdity. A second way that we do that is to minimize or minify things and minify is actually a word in the English language. That is we make things smaller, lighter, less frequent. For instance, if we have someone who talks not only verbally but with their hands and they don't want to do that, we can help them minify their hand gestures and keep them at a minimum. For this activity to illustrate modification, we're going to do an exercise called "sun, cloud, tree." 

00:20:00
SAMUEL T. GLADDING In this particular experience, you would be asked to draw two pictures. The first would be of a sun, a cloud, and a tree. Then you would be asked to magnify or minify one of those features. For the sake of time, I've asked you to go ahead and to draw both of those pictures. Karver, let's start with you and tell us about the pictures that you drew and what difference that make. 

00:20:35
KARVER BOLTON Alright. Well, here's my first one where everything is the same size and for my second one uhm, the cloud and the sun are the same but the tree is much smaller. 

00:20:45
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm. And how did you feel or think after the tree became smaller, after you made it smaller? 

00:20:50
KARVER BOLTON  Well, it gave it a very different perspective or gave me a different perspective. I felt like uhm, things af, the trees is even more insignificant and the other two things even more significant. 

00:21:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So, things got magnified seemed more significant and that that got minified seemed less significant. Sure. Kimberly, how do you draw things? 

00:21:15
KIMBERLY REGENNAS This is my first drawing where everything is proportional and then I was asked to magnify the cloud in my pictures. 

00:21:25
SAMUEL T. GLADDING And when you did that, what were your thoughts and feelings? 

00:21:30
KIMBERLY REGENNAS Well, I kinda feel that, felt like the cloud was overwhelming the tree and give the picture a gloomy feeling. 

00:21:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. So there really was a feeling to it and that was kind of gloom or doom or down, ah, whatever. Yeah. Uhm, Melissa, what do you draw? 

00:21:50
MELISSA WILLIAMS Uhm, again in my first picture, everything is in proportion and on my second picture, uhm, my sun is much larger. Uhm, which in drawing and I felt brighter, happier, uhm, and I feel like, when you look at it, it's that way also, I just put the brighter colors. 

00:22:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay, so your picture was really in contrast to Kimberly's. 

00:22:10
MELISSA WILLIAMS Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
SAMUEL T. GLADDING You were feeling brighter, lighter, ah, a little more up. 

00:22:15
MELISSA WILLIAMS Exactly. 

00:22:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Whereas, Kimberly might have been feeling a little more down, a little more gloomy. Okay. One of the things that this illustrates is that when we make drawings like this or when we change one element in a situation, other things change also. So we minimize something as you did Karver, other things seemed to take on a greater proportion or we magnify things ah, as we did with ah, Melissa and with Kimberly. Then, ah, we get a different feeling, there's a different ambiance if you will to what is happening and the, our feeling about that. 

00:22:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING So, one of the things that we have to think about in modifying is if we change a feature, what will that mean to the whole gestalt, to everything that's out there that we are looking at. Their drawbacks to trying to modify things in life that is some people just simply refuse to modify their behavior or to change it. And when they don't change or modify that behavior or when they change it too much or too little then sometimes they have some regrets about that. 

00:23:30
SCAMPER P 

00:23:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "P" in Scamper stands for "put to other uses." That is to put to uses for purposes other than originally intended. Think of what you can put to other uses and still get something good out of it. Examples abound both historically and contemporarily. Historically, if you think of the movie, "Gone with the Wind" you can see Miss Scarlett taking down the fabric from the draperies of her curtains, and using them as a dress that she will wear to impress Rhett Butler in order to get some money. Or more serious and contemporary example of putting something to a different use is in the Apollo 13 space mission where scientist on the ground in Houston, used spare parts to make an escape for the astronauts, so that the mission could be completed successfully. To illustrate how to put something to a different use, we're going to do an exercise called "adverbs." In this exercise, we'll use a pen and we'll also use an adverb which we will describe as a word that ends in "LY." In doing this, what you will do and we'll start with Metoka, is that you will pass the pen to each other using an, a word that is an adverb such ah, and illustrating it. Such as, I'm passing the pen to you quickly or Metoka, I'm passing the pen to you slowly. Okay? 

00:25:40
METOKA WELCH Okay. 

00:25:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING The only rules are these, that if you can't think of a word, you can just simply say pass. You may also make up a word as long as it ends in "LY." And you should not use the same word twice in your group. With those instructions let me give the pen to you, Metoka and let's see how you do. 

00:26:05
METOKA WELCH Okay. Karver, I pass the pen to you ecstatically. 

00:26:10
KARVER BOLTON  Melissa, I pass the pen to you left-handedly. 

00:26:15
MELISSA WILLIAMS  Metoka, I pass the pen to you boldly. 

00:26:20
METOKA WELCH Thank you, Karver, I pass the pen to you intermediately. 

00:26:25
KARVER BOLTON  Melissa, I pass the pen to you covertly. 

00:26:30
MELISSA WILLIAMS  Metoka, I pass the pen to you blindly. 

00:26:35
METOKA WELCH  Karver, I pass the pen to you flamboyantly. (laughs) 

00:26:45
KARVER BOLTON Melissa, I pass the pen to you begrudgingly. 

00:26:50
MELISSA WILLIAMS  Metoka, I pass the pen to you shyly. 

00:26:55
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  You can see that in doing this exercise that people come up with a lot of different ways to do something and sometimes our clients are not so much sick as they are stuck. They're stuck in ways of doing things as they've always done them. So, an exercise like this on adverbs gives them a different way to do things and a different experience in doing those things. Typical questions are, what other place could I use what I know? For example, I might be able to use my counsel skill in a group or a setting that is not counseling such as, a town meeting or at some other task force. The drawbacks to an experience like this, putting something to other uses or that sometimes individuals are too concrete or too stubborn to see how something can be used in a different way. 

00:28:05
SCAMPER E 

00:28:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "E" in Scamper stands for "Eliminate" that is to remove, omit, or get rid of a quality either part of it or all of it. Some examples of eliminating things in our lives are often people go on diets. They eliminate certain foods or a portion of their foods or in counseling thought stopping is one way that we help people eliminate, rumination or negative thinking or thinking that just simply gets in their way. To illustrate the power of eliminating something we are going to do an experience called "lines of feeling." I've asked each of you to go ahead and do this experience but let me explain it first. In this experience, we use a marker or crayon or some kind of color to illustrate how you might be feeling and then, you draw your feeling out without saying anything that is eliminating language. Melissa, let's start with you in terms of what you drew. 

00:29:25
MELISSA WILLIAMS  I drew a circular line or a circular object, uhm, that shows my feelings of confusion and frustration. 

00:29:35
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
MELISSA WILLIAMS Like I'm going around and around and around. 

00:29:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm, just going in circles. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
MELISSA WILLIAMS Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. Kimberly, what did you draw? 

00:29:45
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  My line goes up and down. Just like I've had ups and downs today. 

00:29:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Uh hmm, and it's a blue line. Ah, which, was that, have pre(ph), have any significance for you? 

00:30:00
KIMBERLY REGENNAS Yeah, probably a little bit of sadness. 

00:30:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Uh hmm, uh hmm. So both the color and the line, kind of represent how you're feeling. Okay. And Metoka, what did you draw? 

00:30:15
METOKA WELCH Actually this, uhm, exponential graph in brown because when I woke up this morning I was a little gloomy but as the day progressed I got happier and happier and its brown because it's the earth tones and I just get happy with today. 

00:30:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Okay. And it really shows you have an up day. 

00:30:30
METOKA WELCH (laughs) Ah, yeah. 

00:30:30
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Good. Typical questions that we might ask in the elimination exercise is, what would happen if I removed a component or part of it, that is how else would I achieve the solution that I'm looking for without going through the normal way of doing things as I've always done them. A drawback to this kind of exercise such as lines of feeling, is that people who follow routines or rituals maybe reluctant to give them up. They may not want to eliminate their traditions or to make changes and that's something we need to be mindful of. 

00:31:15
SCAMPER R 

00:31:15
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  The "R" in Scamper stands for "Reverse or Rearrange" that is to turn around, to change order, or to follow a different plan. I once had a depressed client who went by his ex-girlfriend' house on the way to my office. We arrange for him or rearrange for him to go a different way and he begin to feel better and do better once he got to my office. There're other example of reversing or rearranging in counseling. For example, addicts have to reverse or rearrange their lives in what they do. In narrative therapy, there's a rearranging of life events and highlighting some events that were not highlighted before. Also in communication, there are patterns where we rearrange who speaks first. And it has a ah, major difference in regard to the conversation that goes on. For this activity, we are going to reverse or rearrange if you will, some letters. And you can see that we have some letters on the board here. The first one is the, are the letters that are FLYMIA or flymia. They don't really make a lot of sense but if we rearrange them, they will make a lot of sense. So, let's try that and Metoka and Kimberly, I'll ask you if you'll help me here. Let's put an A after F then put an M after the A, put the I next then LY, and you see we get the word "FAMILY" by rearranging the letters. Let's try this in regard to the other letters that we have. And Karver, why don't you try the second group of letters. 

00:33:40
KARVER BOLTON  Okay. Uhm, start with a C at the very beginning and then if you all can put a, an A after that, and we can actually leave the next three and then put a UM and come with the word CALCIUM. 

00:34:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Great. You've got your daily supply right there. Kimberly how about the next group of letters, a fairly long one. 

00:34:15
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  I'll start with the C at the beginning, and I'll take this A for the second letter, and if you'll take out the N and put the L there, I'm gonna give you this E for the D. 

00:34:45

00:34:45
KIMBERLY REGENNAS  Pick out the R, we put in the N, and put up this D, and A, and R to make CALENDAR. 

00:35:05
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Great, great. Metoka the last one ah, as it's looks now its DORNEL(ph), DORVEN. What, what do you think that could be? 

00:35:15
METOKA WELCH  Uhm, Kim I hope you can hand me that V, gonna put the V at the beginning and instead of this O, I think I want the E beside the V, and then gonna put the N beside the E and finally, uhm, just add D, the O and the R for VENDOR. 

00:35:50
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Great, great. Well, we do this all the time we rearrange letters to make different words. But in counseling, we can also rearrange how people are seated, for instance, Kimberly if you and Karver were having a conversation and you were seated side by side. It would be a different conversation then if I ask you to put your chairs back to back to one another. Would you try doing that? 

00:36:20

00:36:20
SAMUEL T. GLADDING  Metoka, what difference do you think that would make going from side-to-side to back-to-back? 

00:36:30
METOKA WELCH  It looks extremely impersonal and also awkward because you're not looking at the person you're talking too. 

00:36:40
SAMUEL T. GLADDING Right. They wouldn't be able to read each others nonverbal's and they really wouldn't be able to have the same conversation, they would have otherwise. So, you can see through reversing or through rearranging that, in counseling there can be a considerable difference and we can do things to help people either ah, communicate, ah, differently or in a different way. There are questions that we would ask in regard to reversing or rearranging for instance, what if I did it the other way around? What if I reversed a different way or rearranged it different way what would happen? There're also drawbacks for examples, sometimes you can reverse what you've done such as, what you said to one, someone else you can't take that back. Other times you can't rearrange ah, things in a way that you would like too, because it takes too much effort and you just don't have the time to do that.

SAMUEL T. GLADDING  In ending, let me highlight ways to maximize creativity as well as to discuss very briefly advantages and disadvantages of creativity. Some of the ways to maximize creativity or first to get rid of this incentives such as fear. Second, provide a time where you can be quiet, alone, and meditate to think and feel without the hustle and bustle of things around you. Third, be aware that creativity expands in a climate where there's optimal interpersonal interaction so discussing your ideas is very important. Then follow through and use your good ideas and recognize errors that you might have. Finally, give yourself and others freedom and permission to employ the virgin thinking and to get many ideas out there before you select once that you want to utilize. The advantages of creativity are many, here are just a few. First, creativity promotes insight, self-awareness and identity. Second, it energizes and inspires people. Third, it's multicultural. All cultures are creative and it's important to recognize that we can work with all people in creative ways and touch them and their cultures. Another advantage of creativity is that, it communicates messages on multiple levels, cognitive, affective, and behavioral. A fifth advantage of creativity is that, the experiences are usually engaging they're non-threatening, often they're playful and people want to be involved in them. Finally, creativity taps in to the primacy of affect and feeling. And sometimes people need to tap in to that emotion in order to get somewhere in life. There are disadvantages of trying to use creativity. First, creativity has to be cultivated, there's no such thing as instant creativity. A second disadvantage of trying to be creative is that creativity is resisted by concrete thinkers. They're just simply not going to go down that road with you. Creativity may inadvertently promote introspection also and people may bogged down instead of moving on with their lives. The poet and novelist, James Baldwin once said, "not everything that is tried can be changed, but nothing can be changed without being tried." I would invite you to use some or all of the SCAMPER Model in counseling to be more creative. It could make a positive difference in your life and more importantly it could make a significant difference in the lives of your clients. I'm Dr. Sam Gladding. Thank you for joining me.
