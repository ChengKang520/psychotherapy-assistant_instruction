00:00:15
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So thank you for coming to the building and maintaining good working relationships in indigenous communities with the rest of the very tie up. 

00:00:25
Panel Teresa Lafromboise - Professor of Education at Stanford University Lisa Rey Thomas - Research Scientist at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute Nancy Whitesell - Assistant Professor with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health in the Colorado School of Public Health Monica Tsethlikai - Assistant Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of Utah. 

00:00:25
MONICA TSETHLIKAI We are panel, which going include Teresa Lafromboise and Belly Joe(ph) unfortunately, Teresa had to leave early, and Belly Joe(ph) had a medical emergency. But I'm happy to announce that we do have Lisa Rey Thomas, who is a research… who is the research scientist at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute and apparently as well known, because I've seen many people coming up to her. And Nancy Whitesell, who is an Assistant Professor with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health in the Colorado School of Public Health, and then myself, I'm an Assistant Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of Utah and I wanted to start somewhat informally and these questions are for all of you as well as for the panel members. 

00:01:00
Introductions How many years have you worked with AI/AN? What communities have you worked with? What is your favorite anecdote from your years of working with AI/AN children? 

00:01:05
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So, I want to know who you are and what your interest is in working in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities or indigenous communities. Have you worked with any communities? If so, which ones? And you have a favorite anecdote from your years of working with American Indian and Alaska Native children. So, I'm gonna let myself off the hook and let Lisa go first. Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to say, we do have a talking stick. I spent five years as a juvenile probation officer on the Tohono O'odham and Pascua Yaqui reservations and one of my young Tohono O'odham man who was doing some spirituality work with the native elder, he made this stick for me to thank me for working with him, so I thought it was appropriate to bring it as our talking stick, because it's from a native youth who was thanking me for my work with him. So, when you want to speak, you've to have the talking stick. 

00:02:05
LISA REY THOMAS Thank you. So, I don't' know if I'm well known or I just talk a lot Monica, because I that's something that's happened to me since I was little. So, my name is Lisa Rey Thomas. I'm the member of the Tlingit tribes. My family is from Southeast Alaska. My father , Lanny Thomas(ph) was from Qowak(ph). My grandmother, Betsey Johnson(ph) was from Kake(ph) and my grandfather, Samuel Thomas was from Juneau. And I'm a Research Scientist at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute and I worked with native communities, American Indian and Alaska Native Communities for over 20 years and it's my privilege and honor, it's something I, I absolutely love to do. So, I don't know if we're gonna just to do a brief introduction of ourselves right now, and then the audience. Okay. Oh, and I have two children, one who just finished, two sons, one who just finished his first year of college and one who just finished fourth grade. 

00:03:05
NANCY WHITESELL And I'm Nancy Whitesell, this is on… and I as Monica said, I'm from Colorado. I'm in the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health at the universe that we have the longest name on the planet. University of Colorado, Denver and Colorado School of Public Health. Ah, I work in a setting, where there is a lot of work going on in all kinds of different health related problems with native communities. I've been there about nine years and ah, first started working with native communities when I joined that that faculty. I'm from the Mexico originally, so I grew up in the Indian country, but I'm not… I don't have a tribal affiliation myself. Um, communities I've worked with… this is, this is actually probably a briefly time to touch on something. Some of the communities we work with, we have agreements with to protect community confidentiality and so, we don't share in public settings what communities we're working with and this is partly a legacy of some of the research abuses that have occurred in the past in some of the ways research findings have come out in ways that reinforce stereotypes or again communities in trouble and from various reasons. So, we are very protective of that. Um, and it just so happens at the communities I worked in are communities we have those confident… confidentiality agreements with. Ah, my favorite anecdote, I think, I don't know if this is a really an anecdote, but the very first trip I've made to the reservation community, I'm working in most now was several years ago and I went with a colleague who was, one of the thing she was doing on the trip was a health fair at the high school and I went having heard all these things about, how bleak it is on that reservation and how tough times are. Spent the day with high school students and came away thinking there were so much promise and so much hope with those kids and that's where I put my energy senses trying to sort of figure out how to, how to hang on to that. 

00:05:05
MONICA TSETHLIKAI Did you have a story Lisa that you wanted to share? 

00:05:15
LISA REY THOMAS So, I have the number of grants, you know each grants that are partnerships with American Indian and Alaska Native Communities and we like, like you Nancy ah, follow the lead of our communities whether or not we reveal the exact name of the communities that we're working with, but two of them that I worked with for a project called healing of the canoe are the Suquamish Tribe, and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe and they have given us permission. In fact, they were very proud to share that they are partnered with us in this project and one of my favorite stories is part of the work that I do involve spending a lot of time with the elders and that's actually my favorite part of the work I do and I was sitting around at the elder's lunch one time talking about… we're talking about research and… and scientific methods and research methods and the challenges of, of implementing what we're trained to do in the university with tribal communities, who have very rigorous scientific methods of their own and an elder just looked at me with a big smile on his face and he said, we've been doing science for a thousands and thousands of years, we just call it common sense. 

00:06:20
MONICA TSETHLIKAI That's always our fear, right when we're doing our researches. This is research or commonsense. Ha ha ha… but, I'm, Monica Tsethlikai. I'm from the Zuni Nation. I'm a (inaudible ) and I've worked with children for a long time, but not always as a… at the PhD level, I worked at the direct level of intervention as a… a rather treatment center for severely emotionally disturbed children in Las Cruces, New Mexico and then from there, I was a probation officer, so I worked in the field for eight years, decided the research didn't fit the population I was working with. I needed to do my own research, so I went back to school with the idea of that I'd try to understand individual differences and basic cognitive skills to try and understand how we can help facilitate these basic self-regulatory mechanisms to help kids, who don't have the social support, but… many of them do have the intelligence to be able to overcome the odds and so trying to help through research um, try to figure out ways to help kids. So, I've worked with urban communities, I was a researcher with the National Urban Indian Family Coalition and I learned about nonprofits and working with nonprofits and how lots of the things that I wanted to say, they said were too confrontational and too inflammatory and they didn't want to paint the United States government in that way and their publication. So, my publication got re-read in, so that was a interesting lesson in how to work with some of the nonprofits and work with a National Coalition who needs, who need that nonprofit money and so they have to go with what their funders say, even though they backed my paper a 100%, it was all factual, it was all documented was not my personal opinion. But it still had to be rewritten and I've also worked with Tohono O'odham nation and I have their permission to say that I worked with them. And it was interesting when I went to publish my first papers, I tried to do it just saying American Indian Alaska Native and the reviewers came back saying you must identify you're the tribe that you are working with. And I asked the tribe for permission, otherwise I'd had to negotiate with them ah, how to get around that. So you've been asked to identify your source, your populations when you publish? 

00:08:45
NANCY WHITESELL Umm… we… we've sorry, we have a… We just usually include in our publication, just statement that we're protecting the confidentiality of the communities by agreement with the communities and it's part of the, ah and with two communities in particular it's part of the approval process and what they… umm… what was negotiated up front in starting the study and we haven't had any, ah, we haven't had any problem. We, we typically identified the communities regionally, so we will say we're working in the northern plains community, but there are multiple northern plains tribes and we don't identify which one. And it is always a tension because, sometimes we find findings that are related to culture we think and how do you talk about, how culture impacts what you're finding without identifying what the culture is and so there is always a tension of how much to reveal. And it's, it's also sort of the… in some ways, it's a wink and a nod to confidentiality, because people who really know about communities… umm… could probably read what we write and say oh… from this description and even though we try to be careful from this description we can probably figure out. It's at least one of two or three tribes maybe… umm… but those people probably are not the ones we need to worry about… umm. Stereotyping and over generalizing and so we kind of take the approach that these(ph) were respecting that from most people… It's tricky issue. 

00:10:10
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So, my favorite anecdote is when I was on the Tohono O'odham nation, where it's and desert and the kids are just so wonderful, I worked with middle, early and middle childhood and there are so full of light and hope and love and they just love to hug you and being out in the desert, you just… when you think Santa Claus would have that big of an impact in this kind of rural area near the border of Mexico. But I was there for Christmas and the education director dressed as a Santa Claus and as soon as he got out of his car, there were 20 kids warming him and he ended up making a mad dash with the building and you see all these little kids screaming, Santa… Santa… chasing their education director around the building. Ha ha… it's just hilarious. So, with that I'll turn it over to you and let you pass this around. 

00:11:00
ARBLEM (ph) Alright. My name is Arblem(ph). I'm (inaudible ) I, I'm currently at UNC Charlotte, but soon to be a Professor at Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. I'm an addictions researcher and I worked with native communities for a very long time. Um, Lisa and I are on the same lab in graduate school. We had a lab, where we had four native students at one time, how unusual was that. Ah, the communities I worked with mainly in the Northwest and the Southwest and some and the Southeast, ah an anecdote. Well, I remember working with a particular young man related to his substance use issue. He would've been probably 14 or 15 years old at that time. Um, one of the things that we were talking about is what are those particular situations ah, that you enjoy doing and those were the situations that you don't enjoy using ah, and he was talking about he really like to play basketball, so we played basketball one-on-one in a lot of our therapy sessions. And so, one time I asked him, I said "So what do you think about take, for you're not being smoking so much marijuana". And he said, "Well if we continue to play basketball all day, I wouldn't be smoking at all". 

00:12:30
Ha ha… ha ha… 

00:12:30
MONICA TSETHLIKAI They have asked if you could stand and face the audience… 

00:12:30
KERTH O'BRIEN Oh, okay. 

00:12:30
MONICA TSETHLIKAI …in your introduction. 

00:12:35
KERTH O'BRIEN Hello. I'm Kerth O'brien, I'm social psychologist, I'm from Portland State University. And I don't do research with first nations communities. So, umm… when I talk about, I go to question two… ah, I think really maybe the connection I have is through students in my teaching, who are in my classes and who sometimes want to pursue topics in their papers that are really based on research with tribes and so, I think that's partly how I came to come here today and also because some of the panelists are my neighbors. Ha ha… and I didn't know that you are my neighbor also across the river, ha ha… so, so it's why I'm here, I don't really have a favorite anecdote to share yet. Ha ha… thank you 

00:13:35
MELODY WENDT (ph) I'm (ph)Melody Wendt(ph), I'm from the Spokane Tribe of Indians. And I'm studying at the University of Ohio right now in Community and Cultural Psychology. Ah, and I guess I've worked with American Indian tribes all my life. I won't tell you how many years that's been… ha ha… um, and in the Pacific inland northwest, so upriver from all you neighbors down there… haha… Um, and so, I guess my favorite anecdote from working actually with children is I spent some time at Healing Lodge, which is a Consortium Inpatient Treatment Facility for Native Youth and I just always liked when the kids first come in, they would be like, you know just recently using an… just like miserable and making everybody around them miserable, but two weeks into the program without their drugs and alcohol and everything, they just, they became the most respectful, nicest um, just like wanting to learn culture and everything and I really always appreciated that and that helped me to maintain hope… Ha ha. 

00:14:55
LAURA JOHN Hi, my name is Laura John and I'm (inaudible ). And let's see, I just finished my fourth year in Clinical Psychology at the University of Montana and let's see I've worked ah, well, I also have a Master's degree from Washington State University in Counseling Psychology. Um, I've worked in ah, American Indian Alaska Native Communities, uh, well since high school. So, I've first got introduced to research through working with the mentors at the National Indian Child Welfare Association in Portland. And that really got me turned on to studying and studying issues and working towards making things better for the communities. Um, let's see, I've primarily worked with communities in Oregon, Idaho, and Montana and more recently I got some experience with village up in Alaska ah, at the (inaudible ) people also, that was really cool to go up there. Um, gosh I was trying to think of a favorite anecdote and I couldn't think of just one gosh, there're so many. Um, but I think with… um… one I want to share is that, you know often times as a graduate student, you're challenged and you're tired, you're sick deprived and you feel overworked and stressed out and I've two children. Um, I've of a 10… 10 year old daughter and a 13 year old son, so it's a lot of a work. Um, and sometimes I think, maybe I can't do this or maybe I should just wait and finish later after my kids are grown and um, I went home recently and was talking to a friend of mine, who we're you know kind of partners in crime when we're teenagers and she didn't go into school right away or anything and now in her 30's she started at Community College and she told me that, that I inspired her, that if I can do it and I've showed her that she could do it. And so in those times when I feel like, I should just put the society you know, I can't do this, it's too much work or getting frustrated, you know not been able to pass IRB or something. Um, I think about her and I think about all the other people um, that I'm doing this for my district(ph) and for myself and it really pushes me. Thanks. 

00:17:40

00:17:45
DENNIS WENDT (ph) Hi. My name is, is Dennis Wendt(ph). I just finished my first year, here in the Clinical Program, University of Michigan. Um, my advisor is, is Joseph Gone(ph) and I've, I've just… I've worked with this for, just during this past year with Native American Community in Detroit to particularly around the Indian Health Services there and I mean that's it. I haven't really worked with any children or anything so… that's, that's everything. Yep. 

00:18:20
HENRY WIN (ph) Hello. My name is Henry Win(ph). I'm an NIH post-baccalaureate program here at the University of Michigan. Also, we would be starting grad school, ah this coming fall at Arizona State University. I haven't had any experience working with the American Indians, but I expect with going to Arizona state that I have many other opportunities to work with the American Indians that I will have any anecdotes, but so it's just all a new exposure for me. 

00:18:50
TERRY DRAPER Hi, my name is Terry Draper and I'm Alaska Native. I'm, I live at the (inaudible ) and I'm currently a student at Pacific University in Oregon, which is a SIDY(ph) Program and for the past year I've been working at a place called NARA, it's Native American Rehabilitation Association and it's been my first experience really working um, with native people. It's has been wonderful um, so, I've just been practicing therapy in Portland area and I can't really think of any anecdotes at the top of my head. Um, I guess a quick funny story, I know I look very young and so I got a lot of sort funny looks, when I first joined NARA from the clients and an elder finally asked me, "How old are you?" and so I, I said "Guess?" And she guessed 19 and I said, "no you're half by about six years". And she said "Oh, my gosh you are 13?" 

00:19:50
Ha ha… haha… 

00:19:55

00:20:00
PRISCILLA DASS-BRAILSFORD Thank You. Hi, everyone my name is Priscilla Dass-Brailsford and I'm at Georgetown University. I have not worked with American Indians yet. I'm, but I planned too and that's why I'm here. Although, I was involved with working well with Lisa, Emma(ph), and also with Tawa Witko(ph) and it was during my (inaudible ) that we got the resolution ending the use of Native American Mascots on sport teams pass through APA council and my one actually fond memory is Tawa(ph) and I were like finalizing the, the resolution in the hotel room at that time and that she always brought her little baby with her to the meetings. So, this poor kid was like running around the room and we're trying to entertain her and at the same time write this resolution, so people are not aware(ph) of what goes behind, you know the writing of these things sometimes. Um, the communities that I've worked with have mostly been African American communities, so um, what I'm planning to do is I culturally adapted a substance abuse PTSD program, ah for African American woman and I'd like to adapt it for native woman as well. Thanks. 

00:21:30
JULIE GREEN (ph) Hi there, my name is Julie Green(ph). (inaudible ) of something ah, clinical student at the University of North Dakota. And I'm actually on internship, but still working on dissertation stuff so… ha ha. Um, one of the, ah my co-advisor is president elect Dr. Doug McDonald(ph), so I have the privilege of being able to work with Northern Plains American Indians for the last three to four years. Um, so that's been a real blessing and a co-member of my committee is also Jackie Gray, who really helped me to get connected with research wise as well as like the community participatory action kind of research model too. I mean, suicide prevention in, on the campus as well, focused on American Indians. Let's see… part of my heritage… of course, I'm an African American, but I also in working with the communities I have to identify my Cherokee as well as Blackfeet heritage too and that's really beneficial in terms of trust, interest, engagement and community. Okay, so communities I work with um, African American of course, from San Diego, California, Latino, Latina, and American Indians. Anecdotes, I got lots of them however, ha ha ha… um, I just, a friend of mine and I graduate from the program, just (inaudible ) was doing some actually a horse(ph) camp and kinds of program with juveniles on one of their reservations we're working with are just, just immense by, by her and got to do some stress management with the kids. Um, and we use these jorum(ph) bowls and it was just, it was just cool, teaching them relaxation techniques and how to just identify the stress and let it go and identify their support system too, so that that was a pretty unique way to say that I get them connected their people(ph). 

00:23:30
[sil.] 

00:23:35
JOHN MONTAGU (ph) My name is John Montagu(ph) and ah, I'm not Native American. Ah, my interest here are originally from my interest in Community Psychology, we see the methodology here there, that's been discussed with very empowering and useful within the field and so I'm really intrigue here. The anecdotes with regards to how that is applied. I also knew this and I know well. Ah, it will be a good presentation, good she is here. So, I have anecdotes… right. 

00:24:15
MONICA TSETHLIKAI Face the camera and speak. 

00:24:20
DARLENE DAFOE My name is Darlene Dafoe. I'm one faculty at Hunter College, for a lot of years, was many. Um, I've not worked with American Indians, um, I came to this talk, because I think it was in December, I went to a conference on IRBs and I saw some panels on some unique issues of working in these communities in IRB. So I said, I want to come to this. Um, I've worked mostly with African American, African community and communities ah, that often women. Um, my favorite anecdote for working with children, comes not from my work as psychologist, but I'm also martial artist self-defense instructor. And just this week, one of my students who is a high school student who is getting ready to graduate talked about being able to stop a fight using her martial arts background to two of her classmate, where she was able to reason with them about why, you know not fighting because they're getting ready to graduate and if they didn't they would both be expelled like two days before they were getting in ready to graduate. And just so struck with how she was able to use her knowledge in that way and I, you know so, boy my teaching get something, you know. Because we teach them not to fight but, so that was, I thought that was a great experience. Okay, thanks. 

00:25:55
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So, we've some very impressive audience, members, so as panel members will have to step it up. So, I did have one other story, ah from working with juvenile delinquents. I, I went, I used to always try to take my kids and give 'em exposure to as many experiences as I can, because most of them don't have that opportunity and so there was Governors Camp in Arizona for juvenile delinquents, where you could take the worse defenders to this camp and try to put them, try to give 'em, you know some therapy, but, but they ended up doing as putting 'em through this privilege exercises where they had to identify privileges in their lives, which turned into a complete disaster in my view, because these kids did not have any privileges and so what I did is, I took aside the native American kids and the Latino that I had in my group and other kids that had gathered around me and I talked about the history of colonization and genocide and there is one young man said "Miss, you should write a book, because you know what, I hate reading, but you write a book, I would read it." So, I'm still working on that book, I haven't written it. But I hope too. So, our first question is what are the best practices for building relationships with people in the community and how do you get community members involved and invested as partners? So, I'm gonna to turn it over to my experts first. 

00:27:25
Best Practices What are the best practices for building relationships with people in the community and how do you get community members involved and invested as partners? 

00:27:30
LISA REY THOMAS Thank you. And I just want to remind everybody here that even though we're sitting up here, which I think is really kind of ironic given what we're talking about today about building relationships in and collaborations and, and true partnerships. I mean, think what, what this sort of communicates and we wanted to sit down there with, but because of the filming, we're sitting up here, so I want to apologize for that and I acknowledge that in, um, you know I guess the alternative would be we could all come up here but the stage would probably collapse. Um, and then I, I wanted to make one more comment that it has nothing to do with the topic, so if you all excuse me, ha ha… I just love, when I've, I've apparently reached the age where I started to say how many years I've been doing something, and then I stopped and say, I'm not going to say that, because that will tell you how old I'm and I, I, I tell that information a little bit differently, so I love hearing other people say that, it's kind of fun. It's like the next step towards elder status. But best practices for building relationships with people in the community and how do you get community members involved and invested as partners? And again, we'll share some of our experiences and we really look forward to hearing experiences and challenges that you and the audience have experienced as well. But when I was thinking about the answer to this question um, three, well actually five things came up. But one thing came up first and foremost and that's time and timing. So, time spent in the community ah, prior to any sort of research activities, prior to any sort of formal documentation of the process. Just time is so critical and time without agendas and time without timelines and time without deadlines and we all know those of us especially that are grant funded and that that's very, very challenging. I'm fortunate enough to have one of the grants that I work on, be a community based participatory research focus grant, so they actually accepted a year or two, if that sort of time being built into the research partnership. But time and then timing: If the community isn't ready, if the and if the community, if there isn't a benefit that the relationship can bring to that community. Then, the tribe or the native community is probably not ready to engage in a partnership or relationship. So, it's our responsibility really to, to make sure that we're communicating with people who can let us know this is a good time for this partnership and this relationship. So time and timing was one. The other thing that I've, that I've learned in this, this is not what I was taught in graduate school, but the importance of listening. So, going to the community not to talk and not to share our expertise and not to share what we have to offer the community, but really just to go and listen. I found that to be the most, one of the most important things in the relationships that I've been privileged to be a part of in the communities where I work. The third is humility. So, going in as a humble person and knowing that I come in ready to learn and needing to learn. And, and also in that humility willing to share the knowledge and experience and the skills that I have, that they don't belong to me, because I have a PhD, that I'm… that they belong to the community to the extent that I can share them, which really leads to the fourth one, which is acknowledgement of shared expertise. So, as a native person, I think I, I kind of bridged us a little bit, but um… as somebody who has trained in the university in research methods and clinical work, I do have some expertise whether it's appropriate for their community or not, it, it, it depends. But I do have some expertise, but I don't have the expertise about the community and the knowledge and the thousands of years of wisdom that the community members do so, in the partnerships where I work we operate from a sense of we share the expertise on a equal level and changes depending on the task of hand, but always we acknowledge that this is a shared experience. And then every community is different, so building a relationship with native communities, there isn't really a step-by-step process that that we can recommend you engaging. There are certainly things that need to happen, but how that happens depends on the community and for one of the other projects that I'm working on, I'm working with five different tribes and one of the tribes wants me to start with the tribal council that a tribal council resolution in the MOUs and making sure that all the documentations are in place before or even talk to any community members. In a different community, both of them native communities, the community wants me to start with community coalitions and spending time in the community in developing trust with the community members before I even get close to talking to the tribal council. So, I think, it's really important to acknowledge that while there are certain things that that do need to happen, they happen at a different, in a different sequence, I guess. Do you want me to answer the second part or should we enter the first part and (inaudible )? Okay. So how do you get community members involved and invested as partners? Um, one of the answers is the same as what I talked about previously, the, the project or research or whatever the relationship is being built for needs to be built on something that's meaningful to the community and has been fixed to the community. If those things are present, you are not likely to get people in the community invested as partners or really spending time with you. My experience also to have people participate as part of the, in whatever role they are participating in, the meetings, and workgroups and focus groups that you are conducting need to be held at a time that's in place that's convenient for community members to get to convenient and safe. So, understanding that participants may have school children, they need to work around many children, children being part of the process is always happening. I mean, work without children in native communities just doesn't happen. My son is growing up in the some of the communities where I work. Um, but one example of that is when we're adapting a curriculum for one of the communities where I work, we held the workgroups right after elder's lunch so that elders can participate and it was right next to the elder's lunch room, so making sure that the work that you are doing in the community happens at a place and time that's convenient. Offering food in your workgroups is not only play(ph), it's culturally appropriate too. It brings the people that are working together to a different sense of interacting with each, and sharing food is really important. Offering honorariums and add respect for the time that people are giving to you in working with you on their projects it's also really important. My experience has been that the individuals often will decline to honorariums, but-but just the offering of them is really important. And sometimes they ask you to, donate into a group that's in their community. 

00:35:05
NANCY WHITESELL Okay, Well I kinda had a list of things, I wanted to touch on and I think there is one think left on my list… ha ha… So, I will touch on that thing, but I, but I first just really do echo everything Lisa said those are all very important things and I think, you cannot underestimate the importance of listening in building relationships. And so the one thing left on my list is it's sort of relates to that as I think, patience is very important and I think patience with the process, patience with allowing it to unfold and I think, I don't know how much of this is just me and my sort of over organized OCD personality and how much of it is my research training. But I go into situations often thinking here is my agenda, these are, you know here is the specific aims, this is what we gotta get done today. Um, and I've learned, actually I had a very good coaching on this before I started working in native communities, but I have still learned even more that you don't go in with an agenda of things that have to be done, especially initially, you go in to say, here's what we wanna talk about and you listen. And another part of that process as I think as researchers, we think in sort of a linear fashion and many times in communities, the conversations are not linear. There is, there is my, my colleagues who are native talk about the circular process. That's, you know you touch on something, you go on, you come back to it and eventually it sort of spirals to a point, where you have that endpoint. But it's not anywhere near as direct as sometimes we wanted to be in our, got to get this done on the timeline sort of thing. And I have one colleague in particular that I work with who is researcher, but is native and she and I are kind of an opposite ends of that spectrum and one of the things I have learned even just working with her is there is so much I miss on my straight shot trajectory that by, by taking the time to really process all those different pieces of information really enriches it and that's kind of what we find out in communities is sitting and listening, um it's just invaluable and you cannot rush that process and it is really difficult when you are doing funded research to find time for it and you have to argue a lot with funders to get that time and to get that year ahead of time. And I, I remember one grant proposal, I wrote several years ago that we didn't even build in a year, we built in three months for that and the response I got back was sorry that's not what you do. You should have it already to go before you start. And I don't think there is much reorganization. There is more, I think that they are used to be even not as much. Ah, on that, there is more. I do think, funders are being aware that and we actually have grant that's supposed to be awarded next week that specifically around building community partnership and helping the tribe that we're working with to build their own research infrastructure to hire someone to be research director to identify what the training needs are locally, so that people who are interested in carrying out research within the tribe are better equipped to do that. And part of what's funded in that is time to sit down with the community and say, what are your priorities in terms of public health research? What needs to be addressed first in a thoughtful way? And I, but, it's a very exciting project to us, because it really allow us to do those things. We have been working in that community for 20 years to get to this point. So that's the patience pays(ph). 

00:38:40
MONICA TSETHLIKAI And from my perspective, because I, I went back to school late, I just finished my PhD in 2005 and when I got grad school, I was really frustrated because I was doing a cognitive Quantitative Psych Program at the University of Kansas and cognitive and culture don't go together. So, I realized I just had to get the PhD, and then I could do it I wanted and luckily I got, I want to offered postdoc and that allowed me the year to go to the reservation because otherwise I wouldn't be able to, because the patience part and getting your dissertation done in earning money. They don't go together very well. But as a postdoc, I was able to go out and be patience, somewhat. But ah, my (inaudible ) gone away as the Navahos will say (inaudible ) are being foreigner or white person. Those ways often interfere and I would have to be humbled. And luckily, I can go back to Zuni and be humbled, when you know we're taught to brag about ourselves and talk about all of our accomplishments and when I was in my 20s, I used to be bodybuilder, so I went to home to Zuni and I was telling all my aunties, "Yeah I'm so strong. I can lift 150 pounds, and no problem in." So they all gathered around and looked at me and started laughing and they said, "Okay, Miss strong girl, let's see how strong you are?" And they handed me a metate, a bag of corn to grind and said, "Start grinding". So I like, okay. Remember that lesson, don't come into this community and say I'm the expert, I'm gonna tell you what needs to be done, what kind of research we need. Be humble, remember we should be humble, go in. Ah, but I still (inaudible ) myself up sometimes with the patience part, because and with the humble part, I, when you work with tribes, you have to get your university IRB and if the tribe has their own IRB, you have to apply for that IRB. Ah, but you also, if you're working with children, you've to work with the school districts, so I'd to go through those two IRB processes, then I had to apply with the Bureau of Indian Education, IRB process, and then there was also the Indian Oasis School District that also had their IRB process. I had to go through that. And it's not only getting through the IRB process, but actually making it to a meeting where there is quorum. So, sometimes you'll drive four hours, five hours for a meeting and nobody shows up. They say, okay come back next month. You know, and you just, you can't complain, you just smile and say, I'll be back next month. You know, I'm not going away I'll be back next month. And so, it took about six months to even get to that point and then luckily, I was able to get parents and children to sign up quickly and able to, um work with kids quickly, but by the end, I was really exhausted. I had my job at the University of Utah, I had to get ready to go by July and it was May, it was June. There was one school left. So, I went back to my foreigner ways, my (inaudible ) ways and I went into secretary and demanded that she let me handout my consent forms because I only had a month left and I have to move to Utah and I didn't have time to learn her way and she kept insisting to me, but you know, we don't do it that way. But you know, we don't do it that way. And I'll say, "Yeah, okay. I know how you do it, but do it my way, because it's faster". Ha ha ha… So, guess what happened at that school. I got eight kids. So, you really do have to let them dictate to you, how they want it done even though, you may be under time pressure if you want to participants, if you want them to engage with you, it just takes one secretary saying that girl thinks she is the one, you know, ha ha ha… Don't even sign that piece of paper. It will wipe out your whole participation mix. So, it's everything they said is so true and you know, I think for me it's still a learning process to remember. So, there is anybody out there, have any examples or stories they want to share? Yep. Yeah, okay. 

00:42:45
MELODY WENDT Okay, I'm gonna start with the second half first, ha ha… How do you get community members involved and invested as partners? And in my experience of going to graduate school, and then, then going back home, how do you not get community members involved, ha ha… Coz when you see people in the hallways of the tribal office or something, you know and they know you and they know your family and everything, then they are what are you doing here or what do you, how you are gonna do it? Well, let me tell you, what I think you should do and everything, you know so… um, I guess that would be, would be my question and then the best practices for building relationship, so you guys are talking about, about humility, when I took off to go to, to a graduate program that I'm attending, my dad took me aside and he said, he said "Now, when you go and you come back, don't think you're gonna be an expert, because you're not gonna be an expert, you're gonna be a servant. So, you will come back and you will serve the tribe. You won't be an expert". And so, at first, I felt a little bit upset that he did that like what does he think, I am anyway and but then after I thought about it more, then I felt honored that he felt like he trusted me enough that he could say that to me. I know, it was hard for him to say it. And, and so I guess the humility part of it is definitely big part and, and so I try to keep that in mind, you know that I'm a servant, not a expert. 

00:44:20
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So, we will move onto our next question for the panel members. 

00:44:25
LISA REY THOMAS Well, and I just want to make a comment um, because as you said Monica, that's not with graduate schooling, still sort of graduate school tries to instill on us that we are experts and that we are the ones… I'm sorry, we, we are the ones that have answers and so part of this journey, it's not one of the questions, but I think as we do this work part of our journey is also to be changing the institutions. 

00:44:55
MONICA TSETHLIKAI You can actually answer the next question, well you have that. How does working with tribes as sovereign nations impact how you develop and propose your research plan? 

00:45:00
Sovereign Nations How does working with tribes as sovereign nations impact how you develop and propose your research plan? 

00:45:05
LISA REY THOMAS See I told you I talk a lot, ha ha… um, it, it impacts every single aspect of the research plan and every single aspect of the work that I do. And as I said before, when the tribal council becomes involved depends on the community… um, but they, they're involved and I believe that that each community are, my experience as that each community wants to tribal council involved at different levels in a different ways. One of the communities that I work with, um, I go before the tribal council for every single question, they want me there along with our co-investigator, who is tribal member and another tribal community wants the issue before them, but they want somebody else to, to present it before them, and then some tribal councils really don't want, um review much because they, they'll get that (inaudible ) to somebody else, you just want to be kept involved. But I think, ah how sovereignty impacts the research that I do has more to do with the way I interact with the institution where I am at the University of Washington. I understand sovereignty of course and, and advocate for sovereignty and advocate that. It has a huge impact in how we not just design the research, but how it's reviewed and how the agreements between the tribe and the university come into play. So, some of the documents that are important for the work that we do are tribal council resolution that either authorizes the particular research project or authorizes the relationship between the institution and the tribe, again that depends on the, on the tribe and the work that's being done. But then there is other things like memorandum… memorandum of understanding and agreements, data sharing agreements that data ownership and what’s being done with data and who owns the data post end of the study. These are all issues that our institutions haven't had to struggle with much, but more and more as tribes gain more and more regulation over the research or institutions are having to figure this out and I think it's an exciting time to be doing this work. It's also very frustrating. My experience had started out actually very-very frustrating, but I have to say that the… the IRB at the institution where I am at the University of Washington as well as office(ph) sponsored programs have both been willing to put themselves on learning curves about this. I'm… I'm sorry to say that when I started this work with this one project six years ago and I was struggling with an IRB issue, we're struggling with an IRB issue and I finally called the person and… and… I was trying to do some education but I was kind of wound up, so I let this whole thing spill out of my mouth about tribal sovereignty and because she had said what the tribe has to do this, something they have to do and I said no, this… the tribe is a sovereign entity, the tribe decides what they want to do and they negotiate that with the university, I can be a part of that discussion but you need to work with directly with them and she hadn’t even heard of the word sovereignty and had been reviewing research with tribal communities some not much. So but… but to her and to their benefit they put themselves on learning curve and they… they are learning about not just tribal sovereignty, but how things are different in terms of protecting communities, it’s not just protection of the individual participants but it’s protection of the community. It’s protection of thousands of years of sacred knowledge and these two people, the chair of our IRB and the administrator last week came over to one of the communities where we work and went out in canoe with our tribal partners. So… so they really have put themselves on a learning curve with that same with the MoUs and data sharing and data ownership. These are issues that we all are going to be struggling with. I believe that the data belongs to the tribe and I believe that what happens to the data belongs to the tribe. This is something that NIAH is also learning to struggle within one of the ways that… that we've negotiated that with regards to our data with healing(ph) for Canoe project, is… is other researchers are supposed to have access to NIAH data. But we propose that a data access plan where if people, if other people outside of our… that they were not signatories to our MoU, wanted access to the data they would go through a specific application process that would go directly to the tribe and be reviewed by the tribal council or whoever they delegated it to. So I'm… I’m going to pass it on. 

00:50:25
NANCY WHITESELL I just wanted to kind of add a little bit of my experience working with some tribes who Lisa was talking about, tribal resolutions and working with the tribe to get approval and it's three different tribal communities we've done some work with that actually have it's… it’s sort of a learning curve for the tribes. They have moved beyond having tribal resolution or overall tribal review to having their own review boards. I mean one case is actually a officially sanctioned IRB, the Turkey(ph) nation has an IRB, that works like the institutional IRB and RN. Couple of other tribes, who’ve done some work with, Navajo Nation has a research review board and so does the Oclal Su(ph) Nation. So they're in the process it’s and there… there those three tribes are very different places in the process in terms of establishing that. What I think what it reflects is the growth on the part of the tribes in terms of realizing they need to provide this over sight(ph) that they have been providing, but they need some more expertise and they need people within the tribe whose job is really to do that instead of taking that to the tribal council and having people who may or may not know really that much about research or about protecting human subjects and so… so developing that expertise in house I think is… is the point and in fact one of the tribe I said we just have this new community partnership that's part of the issue is to help that research review board develop and one of the things they asked for is, we're putting together that proposal because we proposed a lot of training mechanisms, training both for outside researchers and cultural competence kinds of issues and training for people within the tribe and research. One of the things they said to us we're putting together was we need more of that training. We as members of this research board were the ones who are supposed to be providing this over sight(ph) for the tribe and there is a whole range of what kind of research, experience and expertise they have. So they are recognizing, they need to understand the process better, so that they can better provide that over sight(ph) on behalf of the tribes. And I think it is a very exciting time, you know, it's… it’s kind of the extension of a lot of what’s happened in tribal communities over the last 30 or 40 years where tribes taking back more control over what's going on in within their borders from federal programs, so the self-determination kinds of issues, this is self-determination and research and tribes strive very hard to take. I don't know the control is the right word, but at least over sight(ph), at least be involved in the process. Ah… so I think… and thinking about this question, I think a lot of it comes back to time again, as we talked about before because all of these additional layers of process involved with sovereignty take extra time. So we… if we begin a project for example when we do IRB approval with our own institution, then there is also the process of approval within the tribe and there is the process of negotiating which comes first and sometimes the tribe will say we… we get first today on this and then it goes to our IRB, sometimes our IRB will say, “We won't approve it until you show us approval from the tribe.” Other times with one of the tribes who were working in, they say specifically, “Don't even bring it to us until you you’re your IRB approval. Don't even bring it to us until you have funding, so they will give us a preliminary letter saying we generally support this project so that we can put in a grant application.” But then there is probably a three to six months at least to process once we have funds in hand before we have approval that actually begin the work. That's difficult to explain to some funders and it's again part of that institutional education and I think we're making great strides in that that we can say, this is the project we've there. We have buying from the tribe, it's… it's coming out of that tribal, the relationship with the tribe but we won't… we still have this extensive process to go through it later and again in that… there is an expectation that you show up to explain this… the project that you have in mind that you answer questions that people have and that's for getting a initial approval, then once it’s approved, anything we are going to disseminate goes back to the tribe for them to see and it could be a presentation, I did this morning here. I had to send to the tribe back in March, so that they have time for their review board to look at it, to make sure it was okay and again with… with that particular tribe a lot of the review was around community confidentiality. It’s to make sure that we're being respectful of that and they do want us to put in presentations or publications more than they've okayed for us to put in there. There is, a lot of people when they hear about that civil(ph) and that censorship and my experience in the 9 or 10 years, I've been doing this. It doesn't come across the censorship, it comes across is making sure we've the appropriate cultural prospective that were not misspeaking about things like that and they were protecting the tribe and being respectful of that. But that's another thing that… that takes time, we you know, I get a research study done written up for any (inaudible )publication and it goes to the tribe and if it’s reporting on data for multiple tribes, it goes to multiple tribes and may be six months later I get to submit it for publication and that's a really hard thing to do especially when you are a young investigator and you're trying to develop a publication record and you're trying to get promoted and you know I am fortunate to be in a institution with a lot of support around those issues and lot of recognition of that, most people are not. I mean I'm in environment we've got 27 faculty working on native issues that's really-really unusual. A lot of people there you know, you're saying there was four graduate students at a time. That's a lot of people I know who are either native scholars are working on native issues on an institution by themselves, they're the only one doing that kind of work. And so they're fighting a battle on their own to educate the university about these issues and I think that's a… that's a real challenge sometimes, it’s a challenge to be able to speak up and say. It's a challenge to be able to go back to funders and say, “I'm sorry but I really do need six months for this developmental phase of the project”, and some will hear and some will not but… 

00:56:55
MONICA TSETHLIKAI And as that pre-tenure colleague it is quite difficult and tribes do vary in their capacity to enforce what they ask you to sign when you go through the IRB process. So for example, the tribe that I'm working with has asked that I turnover all videotapes to them that I worked with their community college and I'm definitely more than willing to do that. I can't give them all of the data right now, I'm still looking that. But eventually I do believe it belongs to the tribe. I have videos of about 120 children, some of them are would sing songs for me in their language just because they wanted to be on videotape singing and I think it's a, you know valuable resource for the tribe to have. But at this point they actually don't have the capacity to… they don't have a library or any place where these videos could be stored and so I entered into the agreement, thinking they had the capacity or the infrastructure, but they actually don't. So they actually haven’t asked me to yet to turnover these video tapes, but as a researcher I'm ready and willing to do it when they ask me as long as they are willing to let me publish what I can first before I handed all over. Then the other thing is, I do send all of my papers to them for review, but they seldom ever respond. They won't say anything and I can't wait a year you know because I'll contact the education director and say “Hey I sent you this paper, Oh yeah! I sent it to everybody else, it's fine, don't worry about it.” But I don’t get any kind of formal feedback. So far the results have always, have been, you know favorable to the tribe, so there is nothing for them to object you luckily for me. If there was, I would have to report it you know scientific integrity, I can't cover it up. But… I have to get these paper published so… I can't wait forever and I felt guilty about it because I feel like I should have some kind of confirmation letter, something from the tribe saying, you know, “Go ahead.” But they just don't… they are not just the area and I have to tell myself you know think of all those things, the education director and the IRB who is also the IRB person for the tribe. Think of all the issues he has to deal with on a daily basis. Your publication is not his priority you know, he is not going to get back to you so, right now I'm operating on good faith. I… I… they know that I'm more than willing to do whatever they need for me. I always tell them I'll go give presentations to the school district. I'll give presentations to the parents. All I have to do is ask me, and I'm there. They haven't me yet, kind of insulted, but then I have to think of the bigger picture you know, they got a lot more to deal with then this little researcher who think she can change things you know, with her little publication. So ah… there again that humility has to be there when you're working with tribes and you just have to operate again on that good faith that you… you'll… you'll uphold the agreement you entered into with them, when they have the capacity to ask you to do it. But they may not and that doesn't mean you're off the hook though. So… you just have to keep that in mind and I'm trying to think of my next grant and there is all these interesting questions that have emerged from the work I'm doing now, but I'm thinking okay I need to make tenure(ph) and timing is not on my side here if I continue to work in indigenous communities right now. So I may end up doing more mainstream research until I get tenure(ph) and then go back towards you know my primary passion. So that's something we always have to negotiate between academia and sovereign nations, sometimes they don't always bind up together. So does anybody else have anything they want to share? 

01:00:45
NANCY WHITESELL Can I just have that thing? I think just hearing Monica say that, I think it's really… it is important for us to be creative and try to think of ways that we can support young scholars whose heart is in this work like Monica, without do something in institution so that the real value of this is recognized even though it maybe can't be counted in number of publications or you know if it takes seven years to get a project going and it you maybe by that time have one or two publications out of it because of all the time that it took to build the relationships and get things going. It doesn't mean that work is not incredibly valuable and if don’t… if we can’t find a way to support young scholars doing it, I don't know who is going to do it and I just think, I don't know I just… I just have to express that frustration I think. I don't know … I don't have any answers but, yeah… 

01:01:45
[sil.] 

01:01:50
Okay. In terms of working with the northern plains I'm not going to have, a but two tribes that I'm working with. But both were pretty against open and accepting in terms of the research that I'm doing. But I had to have a community liaison so someone that kind of understood the research that I was interested in but that was also culturally relevant to the communities that I was working with. So I had to have the liaison when I was working with both of the tribal councils and that I had a mentor who had like the resolutions, the forms I needed and she kind of explained every aspect of it and preparing in advance like I had to have all of my measures, I had to have that resolution in place before I went to the tribal council with anything. So that was the soul key and important in terms of in point to the council. And one was you know pretty flexible may turned it over fine, the other one for about five, six months. I was waiting for that appointment, but once I went through it was just they invited me in, let me kind of talk and let me listen to kind of talk and let me listen to kind of okay this is the direction that we are interested and can you… can you purpose(ph) get there. So I just thought that you know it was really supportive in those two communities. Their community, not so much. I think that was timing that you know they were not prepared for that and I needed to you know step back and now allow the process to happen. 

01:03:25
MONICA TSETHLIKAI So the next question is what are some of the unique challenges you have faced in developing collaborations with tribal communities as a member of the tribe or as non-tribal member? 

01:03:35
[sil.] 

01:03:40
LISA REY THOMAS Thank you. And I just want to go back, real briefly to the importance of having our publications and presentations reviewed by our tribal communities and the thinking that some people have that this is a challenge to academic freedom or censorship in the way that I view it in the way that, the communities that I partnered with have… have taught me is, it's really another form of peer review, if we're really considering our partners to be… if we’re really sharing expertise with our… with our community partners and our tribal partners then in addition to the academic peer review that our publications receive. I think it's equally important that we have peer review by our communities to not just to make sure that the… the knowledge is protected or identity is protected, if the community wants that. But also that were interpreting culture in beliefs and practices in a way that’s appropriate and accurate because our academic peer reviewers may not have a clue about that so that's kind of the way that that I have been trained and the way that I conceptualize that. So some of the unique challenges that I face in developing collaborations with tribal communities, I’d say pragmatically in addition to time as geography. So tribal communities as you all know are dispersed, all across the country and across states and they don't… they are not just in the lab(ph) next door. So and I have to take a fairy quite often. So getting to the communities for meetings can take anywhere from an hour to three or four hours each way, that's if everything is running smoothly and… and then things happen like… like has been shared already. The meeting gets cancelled and that happens regularly for very good reasons. These communities are very small, unfortunately more meetings then… then I would really care to consider have been canceled because there has been death in the community and so everybody is coming together for that. But you still have to go. You have to go and… and show that you are willing to come and share your condolences and stay if they like, you and then go home and know that you have to wait two or three or four weeks for the next, for the next meeting to happen. So and I think that is kind of unique to work in Indian(ph) country is the time it takes to just even get there and when I was working in Alaska, I was flying across the small villages and may be a funny anecdote for me but maybe not from my husband (inaudible ) here is, my son was a baby, he was three months old and when we flew to Juneau and then I took a small plane to a smaller village to do an interview and then I got snowed in. So… So he was at home… or he was at the hotel with a 3-month-old baby who was nursing lonely(ph). And I couldn't get back. And in fact that I couldn't get back to Juneau to fly back to Seattle, so he had and I had just left with a little bag of the interview equipment. So I need to fly back with the baby and who had a nurse for then 24 hours and all of our stuff to Seattle by himself. So that's… that's… that was a unique challenge. And then as a tribal member or non-tribal member, I think to think that is most important to me and it guides my work the most is… is the trust that the communities that I partnered with, place in my hands because I'm a native person and what that means in terms of not just the work that we are doing right there but anybody else that I bring in to the community and any future… any future… anything that happens as a result of that and that's a pretty powerful thing and it’s something that… that I think people who are thinking about working with their own tribal community or other native communities, really need to… to think about because it's… it's a relationship for life. It’s not just a relationship for the course of the project, but if a community is willing to partner with you and place so trust in you, then that relationship in honoring of that is really a lifetime position and I think that's unique in this work too. 

01:08:10
[sil.] 

01:08:15
NANCY WHITESELL Oh I can speak to challenges of developing collaborations as a non-native person in these communities or communities I work in, I have no, you know familial relationship what’s so to speak. And I could not do it if I weren’t for the fact that we have colleagues in those communities who are part of the communities who we have build the trust relationship with over many and I… I came in to working with the group who had already been developing those relationships and I was able to join into those relationships and now I have people that I consider very close friends, who are in our field staff in different communities and when I go to the community, I go with them and they are willing to introduce me and to put me out there as to… to make that connection to be that bridge for me. I… I don't know how it would, I don't know I would do it, if I work for that… that made it easy for me and I think if… if I were going into communities and trying to establish a relationship as a… as a non-native, I think you can probably take all of our discussions about how much time it takes and double it because I think really proving yourself, really proving that you're going to show up, you're going to be there, you are going to listen, you're not going to try to tell them what to do, you're not going to try to be the outside expert coming in. I think that would take longer and I think the other thing that is helpful is I think having some understanding of why some of these communities are distressful of researchers who come in from outside and… and not just knowing that history but really being compassionate about that history because there has been, there have been abuses or outside researchers who've come in and done things and collect the data and gone off and not really given anything back to the community. So I think I… I'm very conscious and very aware of thinking about how can I make sure that this gets back to the community and how can I listen to them about what are the ways they need have this information back and… and just be there and I think part of it is when you show up for those meetings and for me it's six to ten hours travel to get the communities I work in. And a latest back in (inaudible ) I have project that was approved by one of the tribal review boards this year. We had a meeting in January. We were all prepared to go and do our presentation and there was a major snowstorm and nobody going anywhere. And so the next month we went and again travelled up there for the meeting, got there. It was supposed to start at 9, at 11:30 we were still waiting for a quorum. And eventually they rounded up enough people to… to be there to hear about what we wanted to do and we were approved but that… that period of sitting there and waiting, I think how we interacted with them during that period was very critical and there was no way it was gonna work if I was going to say, “Gees if no one is going to come we are out of here.” You know or… or even experience of… expressing frustration, I think it's part of the reality of their lives and the difficulty of people and they have great distances to travel to get to these meeting. You have to be respectful of that, you have to be respectful of what's going on and be patient. And I think the people that I have seen that have not… that it is not worked out well who have come in as outside researchers or the people who come in, with their… wearing their expertise on their sleeve and come in thinking they have something to show and come in, you know dressed like they're going to an academic conference somewhere, trying to you know wearing the suit and the tie, the suit and tie thing doesn't work in the… well and that… actually this is a very different in the communities we worked with, there is one community I work at where you dress up like you are going to a conference otherwise you're not going to be it… there are very different local norms where how things happen. But I think taking the time to learn some of that and to try to be appropriate and be respectful of the local culture is the only possible way to make a difference and then the flipside of that however is, even saying all of that, I have never been met with disrespect. I have never been met with, I've… I've… I've been welcomed to the communities I worked with and I think all of those things have to do with why that's true but I don't want scare anyone away either by saying, “You know this is the bunch of, you know hostile local groups that don't want anything to do with you.” I think if you go in with the ability and with patience, I don't… I think at least the communities I worked in, people are very aware that there are serious problems that need to be addressed and they want to figure out how to help that I mean work with kids, they want to figure how to help their kids and they are appreciative of people who are willing to take the time to get to know them and try to help them figure out a way to help their kids.

MONICA TSETHLIKAI One thing that's unique for me as a aseui(ph) or Zuni Indian and working with Tohono O’odham Nation, where I grew up with the Tusan, the son of your group, the reservations is size of Connecticut. So I worked as they have different districts and I went to school at the San Xavier(ph) district kids. But one of the unique challenges for me is really living in fear that I'm going to do something wrong in my role as an academic in the community and get a bad reputation somehow. I don't want a bad reputation in the communities I work with. I love children and children I think know that I love children because the kids always just run to me and they beg their parent's to let me test them, you know because I think they can feel how much I love them and how much I want to give to them and be with them, you know give them for some of them you know, just a little bit of happiness because lot of them are growing up in a lot of very difficult circumstances, so ah… it's always walking the fine line between what my responsibilities are in order to have a job because I put myself into a lot of debt to get the PhD. I need a job and also what my responsibilities are as a member of a community and knowing the right way to be and the right way to act, but yet also having you know the demands that I need to produce, I need to publish and also strongly feeling that anything I do has to benefit the community, but yet the community has to understand that it takes a long time between the collection of that data and the publication that they can use to support, you know what they are advocating for that evidence-based practice. So I mean the research I presented on earlier today as a poster and as a a last minute emergency talk to fill in, that data was collected in 2006 you know, and the… two of the papers should come out this year hopefully in 2010, but that’s a long time and now granted, I had three major surgeries and was laid out for, a whole summer that… that put me back a year. So asking the tribes said be patient with me to know that I'm honestly working, I've not forgotten them. I'm always in communication with them. But I just feel more pressure than I think I would normally and I think that's a huge challenge when you are so invested in the communities you are working with so, is there anybody else have…?

LAURA JOHN I was kind of laughing to myself thinking about the unique challenge so I… I mentioned that I did some work up in Alaska, and I had been hired on to do this project in particular and I was told that I was gonna go up to the village and work with them to develop the protocol and how we were going to collect the data for their… their program evaluation and that I had also been invited to go to their the culture camp. So in the northwest, when you go to a culture camp, it's usually at you know, it’s out of community centre or something then, all I can do that you know use to do, yeah I was a, kind of like a… a counselor when I was younger. So you know, I know I'm familiar with all other things that you mentioned, you know dress in particular, so I asked to had a time about this community because our director had been up there to get the contract done in and he is… is very informal throughout the bush so I said it's okay you what I… got my hiking boots and jeans and you know I went in very casual and ah… got up there and huh… I flew into (inaudible ), it's a five hour drive out to the village and I stayed with a woman, non-native woman and encouraged who is their grant writer and they contract with her to write grants. And so she was telling me a little about… a little bit about the community and she was mentioning that don't expect to be invited to anyone's house that, that… that doesn't happen that you want be going to anyone's house and kind of telling us… telling me some other things. I had to buy all my food because there is no grocery stores out there and she also said, don't expect to talk to the elders, you won’t, if you need information from the elders then you need to have someone from the community do that, that… that’s not, that’s not appropriate and that the elders will be really offended and probably won't talk to me anyways. And so I got up to the community and you know I was… I was scheduled to be up there for two weeks and I didn't say much, I didn't ask any questions and I was paired up with someone who works on the project and I just followed them around and I get introduced when different people came in the office and I would just sit. I was just kind of I guess in western cultures we called a wall flower. I was just sitting and very quite. I had a… so most of the community was already at the… the culture camp and I actually had to go back to (inaudible ) for the weekend. So before I went I found out that the culture camp is called fish camp and you have to hike in three miles and they bring camping equipment and I didn't have anything so I kind of hustled out some… some equipment to get a little tent that will (inaudible ) sleeping bag and got a back pack and some other things and they told me where to… where to go in and luckily the summer before I had one firefighting so I wasn't in pretty good shape. So I ended up with this huge pack hiking in three miles and it had been a pretty rainy beginning of the summer and so it was just mud and you know my did it just fine, I hiked in and when I got in to the camp, they were kind of you know, poking fun at me and kind of making jokes that I didn’t make it in and then or I was gonna make it in. And so I think I kind of surprised them that… that I was in there and then I again I didn't do much and that the whole community was there and I joined in the activities and you know during or right before meal times I just walk right into the cookhouse and start jumping in you know helping in as if it was my family when helping out you know, to serve the elders and cleanup and things like that. So my last few days that I spent there in that community… they were sharing their foods with me and I think they were expecting that I wasn’t going to like their foods so they were kind of giving me odd things to eat. I ate moose… moose nose soup and ah… eel and ah… ah… few other things, I think the another one was porcupine. Um… and I just… you know I was fine I… I… you know, I just got right in there and um… you know even if some other things that I didn’t cared for I just I won’t make the face or anything you know and be very gracious. Um… you know one other thing that ah… ah… the non-native woman told me is that they steam bath up there and so it’s very similar to… to what we do down in the plains, um… you know going to a (inaudible ) and ah… know I was towards the end I was invited to go in and ah… I think they thought it was going to be too much for me and so when I was able to stay in and take the heat um… and it really I think that serves as a metaphor. Um… when I was able to take the heat then I… I gained their trust. Um… you know fast forward a year later, um… I had been staying out one of the community members house. Every night I was invited to dinner. Every night I was invited to um… steam bath, ah… at one sort of the next inline matriarchs home, um… and even allowed to go in her home which I think was one of the first times that they had ever let an outsider come in to her home. And the very last visit that I was… that I had up there was finishing up collecting the data um… and so we got to get this elder inner view done this elder focus group and um… you know we had talked about who is going to do that and I said let me you know let me go over kind of what, what we need from… from the elders and what… what I think would be helpful as far as writing up, how well this project went for you and so I trained someone and… and ah… we actually went back out to fish camp, ah… it was that next summer and um… they were getting ready to do the interview and someone came over and they had him in this tent and ah… said, “Wow aren’t you gonna do that interview”, and I said all I thought I wasn’t doing that, and they said no you’re… you’re doing it. The elders want to talk to you. And ah… I went in there and… and I sat with the elders and um… we called it visiting, I never called it an interview or a focus group, it was a, “Can I come visit with you.” And ah… um… you know as… as you mentioned it’s a circular process, um… if I was quite long enough my, my… my question will get answered, I didn’t even have to ask it, it was almost as if they knew… already knew what I was ah… you know… um… interested in hearing or what was needed in order to convey the message that this project was really successful in a community and I actually got tones more data um… to put in, in the report that um… reached far, far beyond the original objectives of the grant. So they really look like rock stars once I’ve wrote that up. Um… so in visiting with some of the community members that I became close to and they start to consider, they called me a family member, um… so I was really accepted in that community. Yeah, we were visiting and I said, “Gosh I am really gonna miss you guys, and ah… that’s been so nice to make this connection with you.” They started telling me about how when I first got there um… I was being tested. And that I passed the test, so um… you know I think that that’s one of the unique challenges that a lot of people don’t understand, when they go into communities, um… Native American communities, is that you’re gonna be tested, they’re gonna… they… native people watch everything that you do, they watch your body language, um… they ah… they pay attention to how you say things or the words you choose um… your ah… your etiquette, they… they look at all of those things and you know one thing that I… that I know from experiences is that they can… you walk in a room and they can read you like a book. So another thing is you have to be genuine Ah… if you’re not genuine, you will not receive their trust. You have to be real and sometimes being really the same and having a really crappy day to day and they appreciate that because they know that they can trust you that you’re gonna… you’re gonna be straight with them um… that you’re not going to beat around the bush and ah… you know I think that you know some of those little things are… are important to… to understand ah… when working in… in tribal communities. 

01:25:45
MONICA TSETHLIKAI Thank you. Yeah it’s unfortunate though a lot of times, we finally gain their trust and you feel like a community member and then it’s time to leave. This is hard, because then we have to go. So we actually only have two minutes um… here is me and a Shaman from (inaudible ), who is actually… 

01:26:06
Priorities • What priorities do tribes have and do their priorities differ from our priorities as researches? If so, how do you resolve such differences? 

01:26:06
MONICA TSETHLIKAI Um… in a coalition of Shamans where Zuni’s involved us well. That’s(ph)nice um… that CoC(ph). 

01:26:15
Academia • Has working in tribal communities challenged the training you received or changed your thinking about how to do research? If so how?

Eight Strategies for Native and Non-native Researchers Darrell Stolle University of Montana 1. Maintain a commitment to diversity 2. Know and manage the ways in which your culture affects your interactions with others 3. Learn as much about the participating community as possible 4. Understand the historical effects of hegemony and annihilation trauma 5. Avoid pathologizing AI/AN communities or using stereotypes to obtain funding 6. Identify and respect the contemporary sociopolitical context and sovereignty of AI/AN peoples 7. Recognize, respect and affirm AI/AN spirituality 8. Formalize guidelines or policies for data ownership and use, and intellectual property rights 

01:26:15
MONICA TSETHLIKAI I kind of touched on a lot of these. I just wanted to um… highlight eight things that um… an article I am working on with Darrell Stolle at University of Montana (inaudible ), which is going to come out in child development perspectives. Darrell put together this table for eight Strategies for native and non-native researchers and we have a longer table that goes with it but 1. Maintain a commitment to diversity; Know and manage the ways in which your culture affects your interactions with others, so lot of self introspection; Learn as much about the participating community as possible; Be sure you understand the historical effects of hegemony annihilation trauma, those are Darrell’s words; Avoid pathologizing AI/AN communities or using stereotypes to obtain funding; Identify and respect the contemporary sociopolitical context and the sovereignty of AI/AN peoples; So and spiritualities a large part of that; So recognize, respect and affirm AI/AN spirituality; Um… a lot of people don’t understand the history of a lot of the political… political organizations of many tribes. In my tribe the religious leaders used to run the tribe, but the Federal Government forced us to take on the U.S. Government, form of government through the Indian Reorganization Act, in order to obtain funding we had to take on their style of government where it’s a democracy. And so now there is a huge split between the traditional religious leaders and the imposed U.S. Government leaders. And there is a lot of argument that goes on over whether we could have a casino or not. Religious leader say no, the Federal Government leader say how else are we going to make money and I say, “Look we’re in the middle nowhere New Mexico who the heck is gonna come, come on. You know, so there’s that… those kinds of issues that go on. When I was doing research out there, I got approval from one tribal chairman and then another one came in and so I had to get another approval because leadership had changed. So we really have to be aware of the sociopolitical context; Recognize, respect and affirm… I already said, that’s right. And then formalize guidelines or polici… or policies for data ownership and use, and intellectual property rights. So intellectual property rights are huge you know tribes and Brazil and other countries are being robbed blind and we really want to protect all indigenous peoples and give them ownership of what’s theirs. (inaudible ) at Lisa and Nancy say their last words of wisdom. Sorry! 

01:28:55
LISA REY THOMAS We are getting our talking sticks mixed up. And so, thank you so much for attending and for sharing. I wish we had more time because I know all of you have um… experience or questions. So thanks so much and there was a… one more thing that I wanted to mention about the, one more thing that’s important in these research partnerships and it has to do with timing and timelines is we have to… our timeliness also have to take into account cultural um… practices and ceremonial time subsistence um… activities and making money. Um… for instance the communities that I work with, are tribal journeys(ph) communities so they are canoe family communities and they also self fire work. So we know now after a few years of working with them that between mid June and really the end of August, because there… there cultural and ceremonial time is in August, that… that we need to set our research aside and that, that’s okay. So I think that something that um… that we also need to mention and then how we’re going to communicate with our tribal communities as academic people who sit in offices sometime although my director will tell you I’m never in my office, but we’re so use e-mail, e-mail and voicemail and that’s really not necessarily the best way of communication with some of our tribal communities. So it’s important to really be respectful of what works best in terms of keeping a good communication lines open. And then I just want to close with saying, I feel so honored and privileged to do the work I do and it’s… it’s… it’s my life’s dream and I just want to thank all of the tribal communities for giving me the opportunity to work with them. 

01:30:35
NANCY WHITESELL And I guess the… the last thought I just have is I think we talked a lot about a lot of the challenges and a lot of the things that make the kind of work that we do difficult. Um… but I hate to end without also pointing out it is incredibly rewarding work and um… you know as Lisa said I feel very privileged, particularly as a non-native person that I have been allowed to participate in this work and I think there is… it’s… for me these partnerships with people and communities is just incredibly rewarding and there are so many um… I think so many good things that the research enterprise can do and I think we bring the strings that we have. So it’s… if… if you’re beginning this kind of work or so… if you’re thinking about heading this way, don’t be discouraged by the challenges that are involved because on the flipside of that is just… I… I mean I did… I did research sort of more standard research with white middleclass kids for about 15 years before I started this and I would not go back for anything in the world, because I feel like the… the applications and the opportunities here and just the relationships that I have been able to build or just… is just wonderful stuff. 

01:31:50
MONICA TSETHLIKAI I just want to echo that, I mean I do get overwhelms as a pre-tenure person dealing with all the pressures of academia, but then when I go to write my papers I think I am so privileged and I am so blessed to be teaching at a research one institution where most of my people don’t even think of going to college much less being at the head of that class room and that brings a sound set of challenges which is different, you know but… but you always have to remember when I… when I go to write and when I have these papers that I think can really help American Indian children that I am so blessed and I mean if you are in… if you are in… this work because you’re coming from a good place in a good heart and you want to empower people, then I don’t think you’re going to have a problem. But if you want to come into this work which I don’t think as anybody here but for anyone out there watching this videotape who wants to do this work simply because there is funding, it’s not gonna happen. 

01:32:45
NANCY WHITESELL So its lot easier ways to get funding. 

01:32:45
MONICA TSETHLIKAI Yeah, definitely! So thank you all so much for sharing your stories and I am so encouraged to see so many scholars coming up in our ring, this is wonderful.
