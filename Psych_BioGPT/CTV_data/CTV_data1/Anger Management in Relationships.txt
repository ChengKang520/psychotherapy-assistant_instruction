Welcome Hello, my name is Rich Pfeiffer. Welcome to the Anger Management in Relationship DVD. Anger is an emotion that can be creative or destructive depending on how we respond. It can be creative by helping to right 'wrongs' or fix what is not fair, and resolve conflicts, on the one hand. Or, it can spin out of control and escalate into destructive aggressive acts. This program is designed to teach anger management skills and concepts especially for relationships. You will learn how to respond to anger in more effective ways.

RICH PFEIFFER Anger Managment Skills and Concepts. Let's look at some helpful skills and concepts for effective anger management in relationships. 

00:02:40
Angry Feelings Part 1 Angry feelings in relationships are inevitable and can be used for either creative or destructive results. Angry feelings are behind most problems of poor communications, lack of intimacy, and emotional distancing in relationships. Angry feelings start with an experience of pain (physical or emotional)

00:03:10
Angry Feelings Part 2 Anger feelings are a signal, a red flag telling you that you perceive something being not right or not fair. Angry feelings can also be a cover for other intolerable feelings such as shame. The angry person is shouting a warning: Don't get any closer to my pain!

00:03:35
Angry Feelings A Process. The very first part of the anger process is an experience of pain,hurt, or sometimes judgment. The second part is when the experience interacts with beliefs assumptions about the way life should be. These shoulds are sometimes called impulse beliefs because they are quick, unquestioned, and automatic.

00:04:10
Impulse Beliefs Sometimes impulse beliefs are correct: "Ouch, I just got a paper cut" Impulse beliefs can also be incorrect, exaggerated, or distorted, for example: "She's doing that just to annoy me" Anger is oven the result of distorted impulse beliefs.

00:04:40
Shaming Impulse Beliefs. Impulse beliefs of blame or criticism called shaming impulse beliefs function to release some of the body tension of anger by placing the focus outside oneself. Shaming impulse beliefs plus angry feelings can become a self perpetuating loop that can lead to escalating anger.

00:05:10
RICH PFEIFFER Basic Mistrust. Sometimes partner (A) has a real reason to mistrust, for example lying, or the hiding of information, or infidelity, etc. If partner (A) also has a history of someone close to them who has previously breached their trust then there will be a much more powerful emotional charge to the situation. Partner (A) must communicate what they need from partner (B) in order to re-gain their trust. 

00:05:45
Shoulds Shoulds are rules stored in our minds (conscious & unconscious) about how the world is supposed to be. Shoulds become a big problem in relationships because they set up expectations that become disappointments and points of criticalness.

00:06:10
The Fantasy of Entitlement "If I want something, I ought to have it." "If I don't get certain things in life someone is depriving me." "You cannot say no to what I want" 

00:06:10
RICH PFEIFFER The fantasy of entitlement. The fantasy of entitlement include the following ideas: "If I want something, I ought to have it." "If I don't get certain things in life someone is depriving me." "You cannot say no to what I want" 

00:06:35
Fantasy of no "difference". Falling in Love sometimes includes the denial of "difference" As "difference" is discovered and as it is condemned or highly criticized, Love has found its debris. "Difference" is not right or wrong; it is simply different.

Fantasy that we can change our partner. We really cannot change anyone else. It just is not going to happen! You must give up on this fantasy! The only thing we cant ry to change I show we respond to our partner.

00:07:20
Exaggeration Words. Language matters in relationships. Words that attack our partners character, shame, blame, threaten, or reject become destructive to the relationship. Words like "always" and "never provoke our partner's anger and defensiveness. There is always a consequence to using exaggeration words in a relationship.

Shaming Statements. Shaming statements tend to make our partner "feel small". Nobody wants to "feel small". Anger is normally the defense against "feeling small". Shaming statements are destructive to relationships.

Coping Statements are better than blaming. No one is right, no one is wrong. We just have different needs. Each of our needs is legitimate we can negotiate. I can stay calm and relaxed no sarcasm, no attacks, no shaming. I can't change my partner with anger.

00:08:55
Venting is not ultimately effective. Expressing your feelings in a reasonable, rational, logical fashion is healthy for relationships. Venting over and over because you don't think your partner has heard you creates emotional distance and is not effective.

Calming Yourself Daily. Partners each need to manage the stress and anxiety of their lives. Daily exercise, meditation, breathing exercises, listening to soothing music, walks in the park, etc. go a long way to healthy relationships.

00:10:05
Healthy Separateness. Sometimes couples have a powerful pull for togetherness. This may feel good when it is experienced; however there may be a downside to too much togetherness. When one partner needs togetherness more than the other partner is capable of giving, the result sets up a sense of deprivation, which causes a cycle of turmoil and conflict within the relationship.

00:10:35
Expressing Limits Saying "No". It is important to understand that we all have a limited amount of time, energy, and ability. Healthy relationships include the partners ability to ask for what they need from each other. Healthy relationships also include partners being able to say no to each other sometimes. It is OK to ask and it is OK to say no sometimes; (especially when you do not really want to comply with a request).

Problem Solving vs. Punishment Evolved Brain responses are reasonable, rational, and logical. Primitive Brain responses are punishing e.g. vengeance, getting back at, teaching a lesson, anything hurtful or destructive. Problem solving is an Evolved brain function required for conflict resolution and healthy relationships.

00:11:50
Direct Response vs. Passive/Aggressive Response. It is better to directly say "no" to a request, than to say "Yes" and then later act "no". Saying "yes" and acting "no" will eventually make your partner more angry and further cause emotional distance.

00:12:20
DON You know, we should check out a, uh, Broadway show the next time I'm in town. 

00:13:00
LINDSAY When is that gonna be? 

00:13:05
DON Uh, well, you know I go to D.C. That's next. Then I go to Cleveland. But, I should have a break in there sometime so that, you know, we can do something. 

00:13:20
LINDSAY So, you're going to D.C. and Cleveland, and, uh, you don't even know when that break is? 

00:13:25
DON There's gonna be a break between D.C. and Cleveland. 

00:13:30
LINDSAY How long is that break gonna be? 

00:13:30
DON A few days, but, I mean, you know, it gives us enough time. It's gonna be a weekend. Certainly, if I reserve the tickets now, American Express, then we could do that. 

00:13:45
LINDSAY So, you're going to D.C. and Cleveland, and you're only gonna have a couple of days in between those two, and, and you're gonna come here, and we're gonna go to see a play? 

00:14:00
DON Don't start. I know that look. I know that look. Don't start. Come on, now, Lindsay. I'm in town for a few days. Let's not start this today, all right? Let' just be together and enjoy. 

00:14:10
LINDSAY Don, I'm really, I'm really trying. I am really trying. I realize that you're only here for a certain amount of time, that you leave tomorrow, but you know this has been brewing with me. You know this is something that I think we need to talk about. I can't believe that, I, I can't believe that you're getting ready to leave tomorrow. And you just got here two days ago. 

00:14:45
DON Tell that to, to my job. I mean, you know, what, what am I gonna do? 

00:14:50
LINDSAY Don, can you please find a way to work this out so that we save our marriage? 

00:14:55
DON Oh, god. 

00:15:00
LINDSAY I'm just, you know, in our couple of days together, I just think maybe we could talk about how we're going to stay married and how we're gonna make this relationship work. How about that instead of a play. 

00:15:15
DON So now we have to save our marriage? 

00:15:20
LINDSAY Don, you're going to D.C., and you're going to Cleveland, and you wanna stop in for a couple of days and see a play. Don, when is the last time that I've really seen you? When is the last time that we've talked about anything of substance? And you talk to me about a play. 

00:15:45
DON You know what? You know what, Linsday? It's bad enough that I don't get to see you as often as I want. 

00:15:55
LINDSAY And whose fault is that? 

00:15:55
DON It's bad enough that I get to see you as little as I want, but I have to come home for two days, and all I hear is you nagging for those days. I, that's ridiculous. Can't we just accept the situation? It's not gonna be like this forever. Can we just accept this situation? 

00:16:20
LINDSAY What does that mean, Don? 

00:16:20
DON Right now. 

00:16:20
LINDSAY What does that mean? As long as we've been together, this has been a problem. You keep saying it's not gonna last forever, but it's lasted four years. When is it going to stop? And how am I supposed to deal with it if I feel like we can't even talk about it? Every time I bring it up, you don't wanna talk about it. So, I don't talk about it. But, now you're leaving tomorrow, and I wanna talk about it. 

00:16:45
DON Could you lower your voice a little bit? 

00:16:50
LINDSAY Why? Don. 

00:16:50
DON I mean, I'm not a three year old, Lindsay. 

00:16:55
LINDSAY Okay, okay, okay, okay. 

00:16:55
DON You don't have to be condescending. 

00:17:00
LINDSAY Okay, I'll lower my voice. Okay, I'll lower my voice if you can tell me how we're going to save our marriage when you're out of town all the time. Hmm? 

00:17:10
DON What do you want me to do about that though? If I work someplace, I work someplace. You know as well as I do, I hate that job. I mean, but, I gotta do it. 

00:17:25
LINDSAY Don, this is not what I wanted. You know, this is not the deal when we got married, that we would spend this much time apart. That we'd get together, and we couldn't even resolve things. We couldn't even talk about things. 

00:17:35
DON All right. I can't talk to you as long as you're yelling in my ear. 

00:17:40
LINDSAY Well, what am I supposed to do? 

00:17:40
DON Lindsay, you're being impossible. You're being impossible. How, what am I supposed to do? I love you, Lindsay. I mean, I'm... 

00:17:50
LINDSAY Don. 

00:17:55
DON I, I mean. I really, I really... 

00:17:55
LINDSAY You're supposed to find a way... 

00:17:55
DON ...don't know what to do. But, you making it look like I, it's, it's, it's something, it's a decision that I have to make, and I can't make the decision. Either I pay the bills, I work the job. I pay the bills. Or I don't work the job. I sit here with you as long as you want, and we lose the house. 

00:18:15
LINDSAY You can't do that. 

00:18:15
DON We lose the... 

00:18:15
LINDSAY You can, you can find a way... 

00:18:15
DON What do I do? 

00:18:15
LINDSAY ...to work here. You can find some time to spend with me so that we can talk about what's going on in our marriage. 

00:18:25
DON That's easy for you to say. You have a job two blocks away. 

00:18:30
LINDSAY Well, the truth of the matter is, is that you don't want to sit down and talk to me about our marriage. 

00:18:30
DON I don't want to yell. 

00:18:35
LINDSAY You've been here for three days... 

00:18:35
DON I don't wanna be yelled at. 

00:18:35
LINDSAY ...and you haven't even seen me for three days because you've been sleeping or, or you've been upstairs in the office or you've been hanging out with your friends. So, why don't you just tell me the truth, Don? Do you even want to be married to me? 

00:18:50
DON Yes. Do you wanna be married to me? 

00:18:55
LINDSAY Not like this. No. 

00:19:00
DON Do you love me? 

00:19:05
LINDSAY Don, it is not about love. 

00:19:10
DON Well, I love you. 

00:19:10
LINDSAY We, we talk about that all the time. 

00:19:10
DON I lovey you, but. 

00:19:15
LINDSAY But, this isn't working. 

00:19:15
DON you're not sounding like you're loving me. You're not loving. I don't do, everything I do for you. 

00:19:25
LINDSAY Oh, please. 

00:19:25
DON I do it, I do it for you. I work because of you. 

00:19:25
LINDSAY Please, you do so much for me and we can't even talk? We can't even have a conversation? 

00:19:30
DON I work because of you. 

00:19:30
LINDSAY Don, we have a problem. How are we gonna fix it? How are we gonna fix it? 

00:19:35
DON I don't know, but we can work it out all right? We can work it out. 

00:19:40
LINDSAY I don't see how it's gonna work. I really don't.

00:19:55
RICH PFEIFFER Welcome, Lindsay. 

00:20:00
LINDSAY Thank you. 

00:20:00
RICH PFEIFFER Tell me why you're here today. 

00:20:05
LINDSAY Um, well, I came in because, as I discussed with you on the phone, uh, Don and I are just having a lot of problems. Uh, it's been going on for a while. We're trying to work it out. We haven't been able to work it out. And, um, I'm just, you know, at the end of my rope. I can't figure out what to do anymore. I've talked with friends about it, family about it. Um, we can't seem to get passed it. Uh, Don travels a lot. He's going away the beginning of this week, and I, I basically said if we don't come in here, come somewhere, and try figure out how to deal with this, then I can't continue to go on. If you go away, I'm, I'm not gonna be here when you get back. I'm not gonna be in the house. We'll try to take care of things when you get back. 

00:20:55
RICH PFEIFFER So, you've given him an ultimatum? 

00:20:55
LINDSAY Basically, yeah. I, I mean, I don't, I don't know what else to do. 

00:21:00
RICH PFEIFFER You're at the end of your rope, it sounds like. 

00:21:00
LINDSAY Yeah. Yeah, completely. 

00:21:00
RICH PFEIFFER How long has the conflict been going on? 

00:21:05
LINDSAY Uh, well, uh, this, at this intensity it's just been going on maybe three, four months. Like I said, we've only been married a couple of years. But, when we were first married, he wasn't traveling that much, so. I, I've never been happy about the traveling, but, uh, you know, he was home enough where I could, it's like I've always been sort of waiting, you know. And we were together at the beginning of the marriage, and he would travel, but we'd be together, and it would work. You know, we had it, but it worked. Now that he's gone so much, and gone for, for such an extended length of time, we just don't even get to talk about things when he's around, uh, cuz there's so much, you know, ground to cover. 

00:21:50
RICH PFEIFFER It's not okay for you to have such little time with him. 

00:21:50
LINDSAY No, it's not okay at all. 

00:21:55
RICH PFEIFFER Tell me what the conflict looks like. Do you, what happens when, when you confront Don? 

00:22:05
LINDSAY Uh, well, it, it usually looks like he'll be home for a couple of days, and he'll be gone for two to three weeks, maybe a month. So, I'm trying to deal with my frustration, but I can't really deal with it, cuz I know we have a very limited amount of time, so I try to just be happy. I try to just make things work. But, little things will come up that trigger me that remind me of actually how angry I am, and then my anger comes out, and it sort of comes out either in an explosive way or a volatile way, because I haven't been able to express it, you know, for the entire time. Um, so it's basically me trying to pretend like I'm not angry, you know, and make things work. Uh, but it, it doesn't work. 

00:22:55
RICH PFEIFFER I understand. I understand. I wanna shift gears just a little bit. And, I need to know a bit about your family and, uh, where you grew up and a little bit about, uh, your parents or any siblings. 

00:23:10
LINDSAY Okay. I grew up in New York, the Bronx. Um, I don't have any siblings. Uh, my father, uh, was an alcoholic. Um, is an alcoholic, I guess you'd say. Um, so he wasn't around a lot. Um, or, or actually he was in and out basically. Uh, they would fight a lot, you know. He'd come home drunk and then they'd fight, and my mother would throw him out. Um, you know, she was really strong about it, you know. She she just would not take, you know, his crap. Um, so, if he started to dish it out, she'd say, "You know, you're out of here." Um, but because she loved him, or had a soft spot for him or whatever, you know, she'd let him back in. However, you know, long it took her, you know, whatever she felt was right. Two, two three days, two or three weeks sometimes or a couple of months, you know. He'd come crawling back. She'd take him back. You know, it was just a cycle, in and out, in and out. 

00:24:10
RICH PFEIFFER So the conflict that you were aware of growing up in your family was about dad's drinking. 

00:24:20
LINDSAY Yeah, and the arguments that came from it. Uh, you know, it's weird, because we didn't really talk about the drinking that much. We didn't talk about, okay, he's drinking. It wasn't really acknowledged. Okay, your father's an alcoholic. Your father's an alcoholic, but the conflicts that were major would always come from him drinking. You know, they would come when he was drinking, while he was drunk, you know. 

00:24:45
RICH PFEIFFER What would that look like when he, would dad get angry or would mom get angry? What happened? 

00:24:50
LINDSAY Uh, it's weird. It's like Mom would get angry because he was drunk, you know. She wouldn't, he could do anything and it wouldn't seem to me like she was making him angry. It would seem like she was really angry because he was drunk, and she was looking for something to actually be able to let that out, you know, about, you know. Um, he could come in, and you know, he was really sort of like, you know, tail between the, the legs type of drinker. He would feel terribly guilty, I think, you know, in retrospect. He'd feel guilty about the fact that he was drunk, that he'd been drinking. Maybe that just made it worse for her, you know, because he felt guilty, and you know, she was so strong. I think she hated the weakness or to see it or, I don't know, maybe she hated it because she wasn't that way. But, he could literally do anything. He could, you know, talk at the wrong time, and she'd get upset, start screaming that he was a drunk and throw him out. 

00:25:50
RICH PFEIFFER Does it seem like it ever got resolved between your mom and dad? 

00:25:55
LINDSAY No, definitely not. No, cuz he never stopped drinking. Finally they just split up, so. 

00:26:00
RICH PFEIFFER So, I think this is really important, Lindsay, because when we're growing up, and family is where we learn how to resolve conflict or, don't learn how to resolve conflict. And so, because of the family that you grew up in, you didn't necessarily learn good conflict resolution skills. 

00:26:25
LINDSAY Right. 

00:26:25
RICH PFEIFFER And so, it, it's good that you come here now, because those can be learned. 

00:26:30
LINDSAY Right. 

00:26:30
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. What I'd like to do is I'd like to give you a copy of a real solution anger control workbook. 

00:26:40
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:26:40
RICH PFEIFFER And before we meet next time, I'd like you to read, uh, the first section in there, and pay particular attention to the anger log. 

00:26:50
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:26:50
RICH PFEIFFER And, the anger log basically is a sheet where you will record any situations where you feel some strong feelings of anger. 

00:27:05
LINDSAY And this doesn't have to be between Don and myself. It could be... 

00:27:05
RICH PFEIFFER No, it could be at any, any time during the week that you feel the anger. 

00:27:10
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:27:15
RICH PFEIFFER Uh. 

00:27:15
LINDSAY I feel a lot more jailed(ph). 

00:27:15
RICH PFEIFFER You do? 

00:27:15
LINDSAY I'll be getting that out. 

00:27:15
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. Well, we, we'll take a look at that too. 

00:27:20
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:27:20
RICH PFEIFFER And, basically the anger log, uh, is a place where you'll record the, uh, intensity of the feeling. You'll rate it from one to ten, and you'll also rate your response. You're the, the behavior that you , uh, have as a result of the anger. And you'll rate that from one to ten. And then I'm gonna ask you to do something, uh, that's not so easy. I want you to think about what the trigger thought was, just before you felt the anger, pr just as you were feeling the anger. For example, if someone steps on your toe, you feel angry. The trigger thought could be, "That person did that on purpose." or the trigger thought could be, "It's an older person, and they're clumsy and they didn't mean to do it." And as a result of the trigger thought, you're going to have very different intensity of the feeling. So, when you come back next time, I'd like you to bring your anger log, and we'll discuss it. 

00:28:35
LINDSAY Okay, okay. 

00:28:40
RICH PFEIFFER Lindsay, it looks like you got a situation in your anger log. Why don't we talk about that. 

00:28:45
LINDSAY Okay. Um, I, I really didn't know what to put. But, um, I just, something just happened at work, and, um, I, I put that down. Um. 

00:29:00
RICH PFEIFFER Good. 

00:29:00
LINDSAY I work in a corporate office, and, uh, I'm a secretary, and one of the secretaries, we've been having conflict, and, you know, unspoken conflict. And she just said something to the woman that works with me, um, threw a little comment regarding me. And I was standing there, and it got me angry. So, that's what I put down. 

00:29:20
RICH PFEIFFER How would you rate how strong the feeling was, the anger? 

00:29:30
LINDSAY Well, under emotional riles(ph), I put five. 

00:29:30
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. So, it was someplace in the middle. It wasn't a lot, but it was... 

00:29:35
LINDSAY No. 

00:29:35
RICH PFEIFFER ...certainly noticeable for you. 

00:29:35
LINDSAY Yeah. I, I think I, I probably thought of it, cuz it's just sort of an ongoing thing that's happening, and it just progressively is, you know, is making me angrier. I don't really have big outbursts necessarily. It's not dumb(ph). 

00:29:55
RICH PFEIFFER No, okay. So, the reaction that you had, the behavior in response to the angry feelings was what from one to ten? 

00:30:10
LINDSAY It's probably a one. 

00:30:10
RICH PFEIFFER A one? 

00:30:10
LINDSAY Yeah, I didn't say anything about it. I didn't say anything to her. 

00:30:15
RICH PFEIFFER Yeah. 

00:30:15
LINDSAY I didn't say anything to anyone. I mean, my, my friend and I that I work with, we sort of laughed about it, but, uh, I didn't. I just laughed it off, I guess you could say. I didn't approach her or anything. 

00:30:25
RICH PFEIFFER What would you say the trigger thought was that you had just as you were feeling angry? 

00:30:30
LINDSAY Well, the statement was kind of about, uh, making a, an allusion to me being a, incompetent. Uh, cuz she was basically saying, she was stepping away and she needed my partner that I work with, you know, also my friend, to take care of something. And instead of telling us both, uh, to take care of, to look out for something she needed done, she just told her. And, basically she was implying that , uh, I guess she alluded to the fact that I wouldn't be able to take care of it. So, she's telling this person I work with. And I was sort of talking to someone else at the time, and I looked where she was leaving, and she said, uh, I asked, you know, what is it that I need to know, cuz I knew there was something I need to know. And she said, "Well, you know, tell Lindsay whenever she stops talking." And then walked off. 

00:31:30
RICH PFEIFFER So, you felt criticized there. 

00:31:30
LINDSAY Yeah, I would have to say, like, the initial reaction was, uh, I felt, uh, it, it just felt maybe inferior, like, she was trying to imply I was inferior, so ifelt inferior 

00:31:45
RICH PFEIFFER And somehow you're not good enough. 

00:31:45
LINDSAY Right. Right. 

00:31:50
RICH PFEIFFER Is that an issue for you? Do you feel sensitive about not being good enough? 

00:31:55
LINDSAY Uh, yeah. I think so. I have a, a really perfectionistic streak in me. Uh, and I think that tries to compensate for not, you know, feeling good enough. So, I try to feel more than. So, yeah, I would have to say that, uh, that's probably true. 

00:32:20
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. That's something that we're gonna work on together, okay? 

00:32:25
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:32:25
Anger Log An Anger Log is a helpful way of processing your personal Anger Situations. Record any situations that you experience a level of anger (from 1-10) Determine the level of anger (from 1-10) Determine the level of your aggressive behavior(from 1-10) Identify your trigger thoughts. 

00:32:25
RICH PFEIFFER The Anger Log. An anger log is a helpful way of processing your personal anger situations. You record any situations you experience a level of anger, from one to ten, one being frustration, two being annoyance, three being a little angry, and so on up to ten, which would be rage. Next you determine the level of anger from one to ten. And then you determine the level of your aggressive behavior in response to the anger situation, also from one to ten. And finally, you identify your trigger thoughts. 

00:33:10
RICH PFEIFFER Welcome, Don. 

00:33:15
DON Thank you. Thanks. 

00:33:15
RICH PFEIFFER Tell me why you're here today, Don. 

00:33:20
DON Uh, actually I'm here because Lindsay, I mean, I mean, I'm being honest. She, she wanted to , to come here, uh, as sort of like an ultimatum for our, our marriage. Uh, I guess she feels like I'm not really supportive in the, uh, the marriage relationship. And, uh, I don't know, I guess to appease her, you know, I, you know, I, I wanted to come, cuz I do wanna save our marriage. And I don't want, uh, to drive her away. And, even though I, I, I think it's something that we can work out, but, you know, she, she wants to come, so. 

00:34:10
RICH PFEIFFER Don, tell me a little bit more about why Lindsay presented an ultimatum to you? What, something must be happening between the two of you. 

00:34:20
DON Uh, well, I'm a salesman, and , uh, I have to work outside of the city very, very often. When Lindsay and I married a few years ago, she, she knew that I was in the, this particular profession. Um, even though at the time we had a, a few discussions about whether or not my job would permit me, uh, staying at home more. Uh, and I thought, I thought that was a possibility at the time. Now it seems as though, uh, with the promotions that I, I, I've been getting, uh, at, at my job, it's actually causing me to be gone more than , than I had originally thought. 

00:35:15
RICH PFEIFFER So, the traveling's increased a bit. 

00:35:15
DON Yeah. 

00:35:15
RICH PFEIFFER How long has that been that way? 

00:35:20
DON Uh, well, over the last year or so, it's really, it's really increased a lot more. Um, I love my job. I mean, I, uh, I do well there. I, I'm respected there, and they need me there. And, I feel, I feel a responsibility, uh, that my position requires. And, I mean, I know I have a responsibility at home as well, so it's, I mean, I, admittedly it's kind of hard to, to balance the two. 

00:36:10
RICH PFEIFFER Right, and your job is very important to you. 

00:36:10
DON Yes, it is. It is. Uh, and Lindsay knows, she knows how important it is for me, you know, at that particular job, you know. Financially, we can't survive without that job. We, we couldn't survive, uh, on her salary. And, a lesser salary, uh, job for myself. We, we, we just couldn't, we just couldn't do it. And this job, you know, pays me a lot of money. And, I explained that to her, how that financially, you know, it, it, it requires for me to be there. And, you know, I run sometimes, oftentimes into a brick wall when it comes to Lindsay, because she's very very strong minded in, in her way of, of dealing with things. So. 

00:37:00
RICH PFEIFFER Does anger get involved in your discussions about this? 

00:37:05
DON I, I try not to, to get angry, because I know that I have a temper that I, I think I act, I suppress more often times than, than, she's more, she's more verbal and more forceful and more determined and more, you know. I'm kinda like, my father at those sort of a temper, so I think I, I get that off of him. And, uh, I, I, I don't wanna really , well, I don't wanna be like that. I mean, I don't wanna, I don't wanna bring, um, I don't wanna be angry to the point, I don't know, I might hurt her feelings, you know, uh, mess, you know, things up, so I, you know, I try to, I try to stay, you know kind of, kind of casual about the situation. And, uh, so, she's usually the one who gets really upset, and, and, uh, so. 

00:38:30
RICH PFEIFFER Tell me a little bit more about your family and where you grew up, and a little bit more about that, and mom and any siblings you have. 

00:38:40
DON Okay. Um, I grew up in Independence, Missouri. Uh, it's right outside of Kansas City. And, a fairly upper middle class environment. Uh, my father was in real estate, and my mother was a homemaker. And he actually did very well, uh, so it didn't require her to, to have to work. Um, I have an older brother, and my, uh, father was the bread winner, so. 

00:39:20
RICH PFEIFFER He did a good job at that. 

00:39:20
DON Yeah, he did. Paid for my education, uh, so, everything we needed, it, it all channeled through him. 

00:39:30
RICH PFEIFFER You mentioned before that your dad had a temper. Tell me a little bit about that. Or maybe it wasn't a temper, but he could be angry. 

00:39:45
DON Yeah. Uh, I felt sometimes, Mom never really really spoke, spoke up for herself, you know, the things that might have concerned her. Um, she usually , she usually shifted the sort of responsibility of, of, uh, chastising or, or talking to us or anything. She always shifted it over to my father, and, uh, I could tell sometimes that maybe she would want to, to say something to me, but she would always feel inclined to, to get my father's point of view on, on everything. And, uh,sometimes I, I, I, I guess looking back on it, I didn't feel that he really, um, he really treated her very well. I mean, you know, I mean, she's, she's a human being, and I felt like, you know, she has a say and, you know, she should be able to express herself as well, you know, but, I don't know, because he was so strong and so, so forceful and so dominant, I think a lot of times that caused her to diminish in a kind of weird sense. But, she, so when I say he got angry, uh, I guess what I really mean is he was kind of like a bully. Uh, everything that he says goes, and... 

00:41:35
RICH PFEIFFER He was in charge. 

00:41:40
DON Yeah. Yeah. Like passive aggressive, or something like that. I mean, he wouldn't like, grrr, or anything like that, but he'd be like, you know. this is gonna be this way. That's it, and... 

00:41:55
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. What I'd like us to do, is I'd like to give you the real solution to anger control workbook. And, before we meet next time, I'd like you to, uh, go through the first section, and pay particular note to, uh, what's called the Anger Log. And, one of the things in the Anger Log, is put down what a situation was , describe a situation where you felt angry. You rate that, uh, feeling in intensity from one to ten, zero being very little anger, ten being a great deal of anger. And then you rate your reaction from one to ten. If you didn't do anything, it would be a zero. If you got violent, it would be a ten. 

00:42:45
DON Okay. 

00:42:45
RICH PFEIFFER All right? And then I also want you to look at the trigger thoughts that happen just prior to the feeling, okay? And, we can talk more about that. But, before we meet next time, I'd like you to fill out the Anger Log and come back, and we'll talk about that. 

00:43:05
DON Okay. 

00:43:05
RICH PFEIFFER Okay? Don, tell me what you put down in your Anger Log. 

00:43:10
DON Okay, um, for the situation, um, I was on my way to work, and I rode the train, was riding the train. I was actually a little late, which was, had already put me off, in, in a bad mood, I guess. So, I was trying to rush because I hate getting to work late. I hate it. And, I think I had a situation particular day when I was a little held up at home, uh, with Lindsay. Nevertheless, I'm trying to rush to work. And, as I'm going out of the, the train, I, I intended to go around a, a lady who was, was trying to, it was crowded. The platform was really, really crowded. And, I intended to go around this particular lady to, uh, to avoid running into other passengers. And, as I'm going around her, I didn't notice that she had a, she had a little child who she was holding. It was almost like she was covering this particular infant, uh, it seemed like they just barely learned to walk. And, I'm, I'm going around her at such a speed, trying to get up, um, to the staircase, and I ran smack into the little, going around her, I'm thinking, you know, it's free, but there was a baby right behind her, who she had, she had the hand. And, I ran smack into the child. And, I mean, my god, I felt terrible, to say the least, you know, because it's, it's a little baby. And, she picks the little baby up. I mean, the baby didn't even start to cry, but it was, it was a very, very, very hard hit. And, the woman started yelling at me. And, she's like, "Watch, you know, watch where you're going." And, and my impulse was to say I didn't see the child, you know, to explain that to her. But, instead I think the anger with, with the whole situation, um, I said, "Why don't you place the baby in front of you, instead, you know, on a crowded platform, instead of having the baby behind you." 

00:45:45
RICH PFEIFFER To protect the child a little bit. 

00:45:45
DON You know, so I attacked her the way that she was attacking me. And, I, I went on about my way, but, so I was really kind of stressed with that situation, cuz I didnt' want to hurt the child. 

00:45:55
RICH PFEIFFER How would you rate, what would you rate from one to ten the level of angry feeling there that you had? 

00:46:00
DON Level of angry feeling was like a nine. 

00:46:05
RICH PFEIFFER You were really feeling pretty angry. 

00:46:10
DON Yeah, I mean, I was, I don't know if I was more angry with, with myself or the situation or, or the woman who lashed out at me. I don't know. I, it was just something... 

00:46:25
RICH PFEIFFER And how would you rate your reaction to your behavior as a result of the feeling? 

00:46:30
DON I think that would be a five. 

00:46:30
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. So you were actually feeling angrier than... 

00:46:35
DON I actually expressed. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. 

00:46:40
RICH PFEIFFER Don, what was the trigger thought that you had just before, you know, just as this was happening, and you were feeling quite a bit of anger. 

00:46:50
DON What did I think? 

00:46:55
RICH PFEIFFER Yes, what was in your head about that situation? What was, what was the thought that you had just as you were feeling angry? 

00:47:05
DON That I hurt the baby. And, that got, that was it. That, that I hurt that child, and I didn't mean to. 

00:47:20
RICH PFEIFFER So, in some ways, it sounds like you were feeling bad that you had done something hurtful. 

00:47:25
DON Yes. 

00:47:30
RICH PFEIFFER And then when the woman attacked you, feeling like that she attacked you, you reacted in a very angry way. 

00:47:40
DON Yes. 

00:47:40
RICH PFEIFFER The idea that you had done something wrong, is that something that comes up for you regularly? Are you sensitive at all to having done something wrong? 

00:47:55
DON Yes, I think so. Yes. 

00:48:00
RICH PFEIFFER We're gonna take a closer look at that in the future, and you and I can kind of take a look at that, and see how that fits. Okay? 

00:48:15
DON Okay. 

00:48:15
Anger Log An Anger Log is a helpful way of processing your personal Anger Situations. Record any situations that you experience a level of anger (from 1-10) Determine the level of anger (from 1-10) Determine the level of your aggressive behavior(from 1-10) Identify your trigger thoughts.

And finally, you identify your trigger thoughts. 

00:49:00
RICH PFEIFFER Hi Lindsay. Hi Don. 

00:49:05
DON Hi. 

00:49:05
RICH PFEIFFER I'm glad that you both could come in together tonight. You both have been working on the real solution anger control workbook individually. And, I'm wondering if anything has come up for you about that? 

00:49:20
LINDSAY Uh, well that, that we have continuous conflict. That, uh, we're just seeming to have a really hard time getting through. Uh, I felt that it was much more effective when I was working on it individually than when we try to work on it together. 

00:49:40
RICH PFEIFFER Okay, so you've been working on it together. 

00:49:45
LINDSAY Well, we, we've been talking about sort of the work we've been doing individually, and sort of coming together and discussing, you know, ideas and, you know, thoughts that we've come up with. 

00:49:55
RICH PFEIFFER How did that go? 

00:50:00
DON I think it went well. Um. 

00:50:05
LINDSAY Okay. 

00:50:10
DON Do you think it went well? 

00:50:10
LINDSAY Well, uh, I mean, I, I feel like I'm, I'm in the same place. I mean, I found out a lot about myself, but I, I feel, as far as us being able to communicate, um, you know, we still have some huge blocks I feel. 

00:50:25
RICH PFEIFFER So, where do things keep getting blocked in talking about this and trying to work it out? 

00:50:30
DON I would say that the biggest block comes , I guess I have, I have a hard time discussing things with Lindsay because Lindsay has a way of being very aggressive towards what, whatever she, she's concerned about. And, I don't know, I kind of feel like I can't really talk to her about certain things because she's always, you know, and so instead of really dealing with it, I guess my way of dealing with it is not to really, to, to, not to really talk about it. 

00:51:25
RICH PFEIFFER In hopes that it, it will just kind of get better on its own? 

00:51:30
DON Right, right. 

00:51:30
RICH PFEIFFER That doesn't work for you, Lindsay? 

00:51:35
LINDSAY What do you mean? What part of it? 

00:51:35
RICH PFEIFFER Just kind of letting things try to get better by themselves. 

00:51:40
LINDSAY No. That doesn't work for me at all, because I find that nothing changes when I try to, uh, I find that I'm just ending up not expressing my feelings, and I, I'm just trying to pretend like things are a certain way that they're not. And, and because the, a large part of our problem is being apart, it's very easy to have phone conversations that are fake, and, you know, weather talk, and, you know, because we're not dealing with each other face to face. He can just hang up. Uh, you know, so it's, it's a little, it's a little trying. I feel like we need to talk about it, need to grapple with it and deal with it. 

00:52:20
RICH PFEIFFER So, you really have a basic difference about how you approach conflict. 

00:52:30
DON I would say so. 

00:52:30
LINDSAY Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. 

00:52:30
RICH PFEIFFER Lindsay, how did you learn your approach to conflict? Where do you think that came from? 

00:52:40
LINDSAY Well, I mean, I, I, I guess I discussed a little bit about my childhood previously. Um, and maybe I just feel like because that, that was so passive, uh, in the sense that, you know, we had problems in the household that were never dealt with. I feel like they were definitely dealt with in a very strong manner. But, they were just recurring the same, nothing would change really. The problem would get talked about, but as far as what can we change to make the problem not come up again, that was never dealt with. And so, I think I have a tendency to do that, you know, I, obviously, you know, Don feels I'm aggressive, so, you know, I aggressively deal with this, obviously. But, you know, two years later it's still, we're still in the same place. So, obviously I'm, um not aggressive enough. 

00:53:40
RICH PFEIFFER So, Don. How did you learn your approach to dealing with conflict? 

00:53:45
DON Mm. I would say I, I learned it from my mother. And, I noticed for, when, when we were, when I was growing up, I noticed that she handled things very simply, you know. Everything was, was fine, um, concerning the decisions that my father made. It was like she trusted him or respected him enough to know that he would never jeopardize the family or she just respected him as, as, as a man, number one, and as a human being, she, you know. And so, I, I watched how, how she dealt with my father. And, that sort of taught me or at least gives me an idea the way I think the family structure should be. 

00:55:00
RICH PFEIFFER So, you took on the way that your mom dealt with your dad. I'm thinking about that, and it seems to me that Lindsay doesn't do it the same way your mom did. So, that's very different, and it must feel like that's not okay for you. 

00:55:20
DON Right. Right. 

00:55:20
RICH PFEIFFER Don, what do you think about that? 

00:55:25
DON Well, I feel, and I don't want you to get me wrong, cuz I, I mean, I love my wife. I, I, I really do, but I feel like when I go to work that, that affirmation that I receive from the people I work with, from my, my boss, from my clients. It, it's such a, it's such a high for me to be able to experience someone who appreciates my work and my effort. But, when I come home, it's like where's the love, you know? I get no love. And, I, it, it, I mean, it's hard for me to say this because I know that she's looking at it from, from, from her point of view, and I'm, I'm looking at it from. Everybody needs to feel like they're wanted. 

00:56:30
LINDSAY I'm sorry. 

00:56:30
DON And that they're needed. 

00:56:30
LINDSAY I, I, I just think that that's utterly ridiculous that you are talking about where's the love, you know, from your household, when you're, when you'ren to there often enough. I mean, I just, I, I, that is unbelievable to me, that you're gonna sit here and say I go to work, and I get affirmed, and I get appreciated when you spend the quantity of your time with those people How am I supposed to appreciate you and give you all this adoration when I see you a quarter of the time that they do? 

00:57:05
DON Well, listen to, to, to, to what you're saying and how you're saying it. Do you feel that if I talked to you the way that you talk or are talking to me and are talking right now, that I would feel. 

00:57:20
LINDSAY Don, I am just, I'm tired of it. 

00:57:20
DON That you would feel? 

00:57:20
LINDSAY What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to be just loving and adoring despite the fact that my needs aren't getting met? I mean, what, what am I supposed to do here? Just tie myself in knots so that Don can be happy? So Don can go to work and be happy, and Don can come home and be happy? What about Lindsay? 

00:57:35
DON But, you do your things. You do your things, but I never say anything about when you do your things. 

00:57:40
LINDSAY Well, that's just cuz you don't care. 

00:57:45
DON And that's not true. That is not true. 

00:57:45
LINDSAY Well, that' show I feel. 

00:57:50
DON And I don't know why you would say that. 

00:57:50
LINDSAY That's how I feel. That's why. 

00:57:50
DON That is not even true. I do care. That's why I'm here. 

00:57:55
LINDSAY Well, obviously you don't, cuz you can't spend enough time with me, and then you talk about, oh, I don't mind when you do whatever with whomever. Well, of course, you don't. 

00:58:00
DON Well, I don't. 

00:58:00
LINDSAY Cuz, you're not around. How would care? 

00:58:05
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. Let me me jump in here, and see if I can be helpful. Let's look at this for a second. Don's saying that work gives him a lot of satisfaction and meets his needs in terms of making him feel better about himself, in terms of his self worth. And, what we said before was that Don gets his primary sense of identity from his work. Okay? What we also said before is that Lindsay gets her primary sense of identity from her relationship. So, the way the situation is between the two of you is that Don is working hard at his primary identification, which he receives from work. Lindsay's not getting that. She's not getting her needs met through her relationship, which gives her her sense of self worth. So, there's something that's unbalanced here. 

00:59:15
DON I hear what you're saying, but, I mean, being honest, I mean, all cards on the table, I think Lindsay is being selfish, and I think she's being childish because while she, in one breath, tells me about being committed, this that and the other. You stay at home. You stay at home. She gives me no alternative as to when I question her, when I give her the, the, this, this what I feel back to her, when I let her know, wha do you want me to do or what do you suggest? She has nothing to say. All she has is complaints. All she has is complaints. 

00:59:50
LINDSAY Well, how am I supposed to know what we should do about your job? How am I supposed to know that. 

00:59:55
DON Well, then that's selfish, because you can't, you can't understand what it's like to go to, to my job. 

01:00:00
LINDSAY You know, it's like no matter what I do, I'm selfish. No matter what I do, I'm selfish. I want him to be home as a husband, but I'm so crazy for that. That's so crazy for a wife to want her husband at home with her. How is that selfish? 

01:00:15
DON It's not logical. How am I going to work, how am I going to work and provide for the family if I'm at home with you 24/7? 

01:00:20
LINDSAY How many people, how many husbands do travel the way you do? How many, all my girlfriends, I talk to them. Their husbands are home. They have dinner every night at home. They go out on the weekends. But, I'm so crazy. I'm so selfish. My husband travels three weeks out of the month. I'm so crazy. How am I crazy? 

01:00:40
RICH PFEIFFER And, so, by Don not spending time with you, you, makes you feel pretty bad about yourself. Does that make sense? 

01:00:55
LINDSAY Yeah, that's true. Yes, I do not feel good about myself. 

01:01:00
RICH PFEIFFER So, the, the conflict that you're working with here is that Don can't let go of doing something that makes him feel okay about himself, and as a result, Lindsay ends up feeling not okay about herself because she's not getting enough time from her relationship. Do you see the situations that we're up against here? It's a very, very difficult situation. I'd like to talk a little bit about the issue of shame here, okay, because I think it's, it's gonna be helpful for us. Shame is essentially the situation about how we feel about ourself, our self esteem. Shame is about not feeling acceptable, not feeling adequate, feeling like there's something wrong with us. My sense is that shame is a big piece of what's going on for both of you here. Don, because of his background growing up, had some issues around shame in terms of feeling adequate, feeling, uh, good enough, feeling acceptable. He had a father who, who was a successful man. Boys are always trying to emulate their father in some way. But, there was something not feeling okay about himself that needs to happen for him now. And he gets that need met through his work. And Lindsay, growing up with her mom, had a strong mom and saw how that worked, and, and the issue of shame in there was perhaps something about dad not being available to her. Dad was not there for whatever reason. 

01:02:55
DON It's like she's putting that on me, you know? 

01:03:00
LINDSAY What was the... 

01:03:00
RICH PFEIFFER Okay, but let's, let's, let's keep looking at this for a second, because it has to do with a wound that Lindsay received early on that she is sensitive to. It made hr feel like she wasn't okay. That's how children interpret when a parent isn't around. They feel like there is something wrong with them. If they were better, the parent would be there. Now, that's really not true. Lindsay's father needs to own the shame, but deep down inside, Lindsay has taken that shame in. And so this is a very important aspect of what's happening between the two of you. You're both trying to work out issues about shame, about feeling okay about yourself. One of the major defenses against shame, because shame is such a hurtful feeling. We can't really tolerate the shame, so we have to develop defenses around it. And one of the big defenses is anger. So, when one of you starts getting close to something about your shame, you begin to get angry. Now, what I'd like to be able to do is help you not necessarily have to use that defense of anger and rather talk about the fact that you're not feeling good about yourself. I believe that as we're more able to do that, you'll be able to understand the other person's real feelings here. And then we can move on to try to find some conflict resolution. Does that make sense? 

01:04:50
DON Mm-hmm. 

01:04:50
LINDSAY Mm-hmm. 

01:04:50
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. Let's switch gears just a little bit and move into the idea of conflict resolution. One of the clear problems for you guys is that you haven't been able to figure out some options to this situation of Lindsay getting more time, and Don being able to get some of his needs met. Can you guys think of any options at all where you each get some of what you need? 

01:05:25
LINDSAY Him not traveling so much. 

01:05:25
DON At least she's honest. 

01:05:30
RICH PFEIFFER Can you think of any, Don? Where you can still get some of what you need, and Lindsay gets some of what she needs. 

01:05:45
DON I don't think I, I don't think it's an impossibility for me not to at least talk to someone about not traveling as much. In other words, I think I can get by with traveling maybe half the, the number of times. 

01:06:10
LINDSAY Yeah, but I feel like that's an ultimatum. It's like, okay, well if I'm not gonna travel so much, then you better be, you know, affectionate, adoring and make it worth my while. I, I don't feel like that's, you know, I don't feel like that's a good proposition. 

01:06:25
DON Well, well, well what's, what's wrong with being affectionate and nurturing on the times at home rather than the nagging at me non stop? 

01:06:35
LINDSAY Well, if, if, if I, if I feel that way, that's fine, but I don't feel like I was nagging and that sent you off, you know, to all these excursions that you've, you've obviously felt that you needed. 

01:06:45
DON But, but Lindsay, if I can, if I can not travel, and I can spend the time with you more. 

01:06:55
LINDSAY But, we're still gonna have conflicts. We're still gonna have problems. We're married. 

01:07:00
DON But, Lindsay... 

01:07:00
LINDSAY So what does that mean that, what does that mean that if we have problems now then he, he's gonna start traveling again? 

01:07:05
DON No. No. 

01:07:05
LINDSAY Well, I have to be on my best behavior? 

01:07:05
DON I just need, I just need support. I mean, I, I don't, I'm not... 

01:07:10
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. Let's take a look at, at what both of you are saying here. Don's suggesting that he can cut back his traveling somewhat. Lindsay is saying... 

01:07:20
DON Who cares? 

01:07:25
RICH PFEIFFER That's, Lindsay's saying okay, that sounds interesting, but don't expect that all of a sudden I'm gonna be able to fill in all your needs that you get at work. 

01:07:40
LINDSAY Exactly. I mean, which I feel like I'm just, you know, I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place here. I feel like, okay, so he just wanted to start traveling all, all this time because he gets, he feels like he gets affirmed at work, and obviously he doesn't get affirmed at home. So, now he's gonna cut back traveling, so now he's gonna come home more , but like I'm supposed to be his ideal, you know, whatever his fantasy of a wife is. I mean, that's just not reality. 

01:08:05
RICH PFEIFFER And that doesn't feel right to you. 

01:08:05
LINDSAY No, it doesn't. It feels like I'm, you know, what about what is going on with me? 

01:08:10
RICH PFEIFFER Okay. That sounds reasonable. Lindsay, if Don cuts back some of his hours, and he's able to give you more time, what would he need to do in order to allow you to begin to feel more like you're able give him some of what he needs? 

01:08:30
LINDSAY Well, I just feel like it needs to be unconditional time, you know. I, I feel like that the experience of him being home, you know, needs to be approached in an unconditional manner. You know, it doesn't mean we aren't gonna argue. It doesn't mean I'm still not gonna have needs that he's gonna interpret as me nagging. You know, I just, I, I don't feel comfortable with the idea of okay, I'll do this, but I want this now. You know, like, like I'm some bargain tool. That's just, it doesn't work for me. I mean, if you wanna travel, just go. You know, I'll, you know, I'll do my thing. Like I can take care of myself. 

01:09:00
RICH PFEIFFER You're laughing, Don. What's up? 

01:09:05
DON I'm, I mean, I love Lindsay. I mean, I, I do. I, she, she used to actually be more fun when we first started dating. Now it's like... 

01:09:10
LINDSAY I'm so tired of that. 

01:09:10
RICH PFEIFFER When you had more time... 

01:09:10
DON Now it's like, I mean we used to laugh, you know. Everything used to be funny. But, now it's like everything is so serious. It's just like, I wanna say, "Loosen up." 

01:09:25
RICH PFEIFFER Well, and part, Don, it's because Lindsay's not getting her needs met, and because she isn't getting enough time from you. So, let, let's, let's do this. Because of our time, let's suggest that between now and when we meet again, Don's going to look into the possibility of getting more time off to spend with Lindsay. And, at the same time, is going to try to give quality time to Lindsay. Does that sound like a reasonable next step for us? 

01:10:05
LINDSAY It's fine with me as long as Don can do it without expectations, you know. Without expecting me to, you know, be whatever he things. 

01:10:15
RICH PFEIFFER You have, you have... 

01:10:15
LINDSAY Time at home is what it is. 

01:10:15
RICH PFEIFFER You have some reservations about whether this is really gonna occur in a way that's gonna be okay for you. 

01:10:25
LINDSAY I do, but I'm willing to see. I mean, I, what else can I do? 

01:10:30
RICH PFEIFFER That's about as good as we can expect right now. Okay. See you next time. 

01:10:35
LINDSAY All right. 

01:10:40
[music] 

01:10:40
Lindsay & Don come to the final couple therapy session The couple finishes their work with Dr. Pfeiffer 

01:10:40
RICH PFEIFFER Lindsay and Don come to the final therapy session. The couple finishes their work with Dr. Pfeiffer. So tell me where you guys are at this week? 

01:10:50
LINDSAY Well. 

01:10:55
DON A very different place than where we were... 

01:10:55
LINDSAY Yeah. 

01:10:55
DON ...before. Um, I'm home more. Um, in our agreement we both decided that I would not travel, um, as extensively as I had been traveling. 

01:11:15
LINDSAY Yeah, I, I, you know, we, agreed, talked about the travel and worked that out. Um, came up with a plan for that. 

01:11:25
RICH PFEIFFER What's your plan? 

01:11:30
LINDSAY That, uh, he wouldn't travel more than one week at a time, or if he had to travel he wouldn't, you know, he wouldn't travel more than seven days. You know, it doesn't have to be seven days at a time. He can take two days, three days here, but a total of seven days in a month would be away. And, um... 

01:11:45
DON Pretty much like a compromise. 

01:11:50
LINDSAY Right. 

01:11:50
DON I mean, because , uh, she never asked for me not to do it, you know. That would have been a whole new, new ballgame if I was not able to, to work it out so that on certain days I, I could still do this. 

01:12:10
LINDSAY Right. It was a difference between three weeks and one week of travel, which made a huge difference, and also just the fact that he was willing to do that, you know. We sat down, uh, and instead of arguing, you know, I was able to say, "This is what I need." You know, and he could validate that. You know, he, you know, for the first time, he really started to in this process of of even, you know, hearing it and saying, "Okay, so you need this." Okay. And I could listen to what he needed, you know. And he would say, "Well, I need to travel. I like to travel. It's a very important part of myjob. I don't necessarily need to do it as much as I've been doing it, but I still need to do it." And, I could say, "Okay, well I love this person. You know, I married this person. Okay. And he needs to do that." So, we sort of like really were able to hear what each other needed, and, um. 

01:13:00
DON Definitely. 

01:13:00
LINDSAY could acknowledge that and still, you know. 

01:13:05
DON And respect it, too, you know. 

01:13:05
LINDSAY Yeah. 

01:13:05
DON There's so much more at the mutual respect that we have for one another, because it's like we both win, you know. 

01:13:20
LINDSAY Yeah. 

01:13:20
DON She, she has what she wants, and I have what I want. And, I, I actually feel a lot better about not traveling as much, but spending more time. Because I think I was driven more towards my job than I was towards making our relationship work. So, I actually feel much much better now, um, emotionally, I guess. 

01:13:55
LINDSAY Yeah, I know I feel, it feels really great. Um, I, I just feel really great in the relationship, you know, than I was before. I just, there was so much fighting, you know, that I, I just, nothing good was coming from that. 

01:14:10
RICH PFEIFFER Obviously you guys are in a much better place than you were a couple of months ago. What I'd like to focus on at the moment is how did this happen? How did you make the shift from where you were before to what you're experiencing now? 

01:14:30
DON Well, I, I believe the last few sessions that, that we've had has caused me to, to to really address how, how Lindsay feels about me not being home as much as I should be. And, in that process and, you know, also the discussions that we've had, in that process, it's like, I felt like I needed to address what was important to her rather than always focusing on what was important to me, because I noticed that whenever I focused on what was important to me, we, it's like, we bumped, we bumped heads constantly. 

01:15:25
LINDSAY And it was just also, I mean it was really, you know, important for us to, to realize that we, we did love each other. I mean, you know, it's like, you know, two people love each other, but they can't work things out. And, you know, we had to really sit down and prioritize. Well, are we gonna, you know, because there are couples sessions in here where I was just like, well, forget it. I mean, this isn't gonna work, you know. He doesn't wanna be with me. Doesn't wanna stay home, obviously, you know, that's just too problemtic to deal with. But, we had to really get back to grassroots, and say we wanna be married. Obviously we love each other. 

01:16:00
DON And, I realized that I didn't wanna lose , lose Lindsay, and, and, and lose what we have in our relationship, what we've built over the years. I didn't wanna lose it. I wanted to work towards it, just as, as much, and I wanted to succeed in doing it, just as much as I succeed in what I do at work, you know, 

01:16:20
LINDSAY Yeah. 

01:16:20
DON And now it's like I have that opportunity to, to work and to put my energy and my focus towards making this, this, this marriage work. 

01:16:30
LINDSAY Yeah. But, I think, you know, that was, that was huge, when, when we just came to that. We do want it to work. What do we have to do? And, and sitting down and going step by step, figuring out, you know, how we make that work. 

01:16:45
DON And now it's like we work together. 

01:16:45
LINDSAY Yeah. 

01:16:45
DON It, it's like we almost validate each other, you know, because what she feels is important, I feel is important. 

01:16:55
LINDSAY Right. And that's, that's a big difference. It was never like that before. 

01:16:55
DON Never. And now, it's like I, I can see, okay, that, that, that means something to you, so, whatever I need to do. It's almost like sacrificial to me, you know. It's like, if I really think about it, my father was never selfish. He was sacrificial, even though he did it in the way that he, he did it, but he gave. He gave, he gave, he gave, he gave, he gave. That's all he did, and now that I look back on it, I realize that's, that's what made him so admirable to me, is that he had that ability to, to, to give and not only to take. And, I, I feel like our relationship now is, is, is ... 

01:17:45
LINDSAY And we go out on dates. It's romantic. 

01:17:50
DON We just went to a Broadway show. You wanna tell him about that? 

01:17:55
LINDSAY No. 

01:17:55
DON Okay. 

01:18:00
