Career Counseling Skills 1 Gathering background information and establishing a culturally-appropriate working alliance 

00:01:55
ANIKA K. WARREN  Gathering background information and establishing a culturally appropriate working alliance are important counseling skills that help the counselor understand the client. By asking open-ended questions, without making stereotypical assumptions about the client's life experiences, the counselor is able to be more culturally sensitive in session. 

00:02:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Hi Douglas, my name is Dr. Anika Warren. It's nice to meet you. 

00:02:35
DOUGLAS Nice to meet you. 

00:02:35
ANIKA K. WARREN And uhm, I understand that you are here for career counseling today. 

00:02:40
DOUGLAS Yeah. I'm trying to, I have never really tried career counseling before and now, a couple of things are coming up in terms of my own life, recently graduating school, my undergraduate so, you know, I heard this might be something that might be helpful. 

00:02:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Great, great. One thing that I like to do in my first session, the first time I meet with someone, is I like to get a little background information about them. Even though you are coming in for career counseling, I think a big part of career counseling is how it intersects with other aspects of our lives.(crosstalk) 

00:03:05
DOUGLAS Okay. 

00:03:05
ANIKA K. WARREN So, I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about uhm, just where you grew up and who you grew up with as far as the environment you grew up in. 

00:03:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. Uhm, I grew up in Boston, in a neighborhood called East Boston. Uhm, and it was very working-class, primarily, Latino immigrant. Uhm, I grew up with my ah, family, five kids, two parents. My family, my parents are still together... (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
DOUGLAS Uhm, and we grew up, kinda, working-class, working poor uhm, and so there, I guess that really shaped, we were a very close family, so I guess that really shapes and continuously form kind of my life decisions. 

00:03:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. You mentioned that the neighborhood that you grew up in was primarily Latina-Latino... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and I'm wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your ethnic background... (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:03:50
ANIKA K. WARREN as well as uhm, siblings uhm, who's older, who's younger male, female. 

00:03:55
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:03:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
DOUGLAS Uhm, my family is Vietnamese. 

00:03:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
DOUGLAS We came as refugees. Well, my parents and older siblings came... (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
DOUGLAS I was the first one born here. I was refugee about 23, 24... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
DOUGLAS ...years ago. Uhm, I'm the fourth of five children, like I said. My eldest brother is 12 years older than me. He is 34 this year. Then I have two older sisters, one who is seven years older and one who is two years older. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:04:15
DOUGLAS So, I grew up very close with her. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:04:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, and then I have a younger brother who is seven years younger. 

00:04:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. Interesting. So, how would you describe your upbringing as far as family interactions in the home. You mentioned... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...that you were Vietnamese and I'm wondering, like culturally, what the experience was like? 

00:04:30
DOUGLAS Right. Uhm, it was very kind of a close-knit family. My parents worked a lot so they weren't always around. Uhm, but nevertheless, the family was very close in terms of my brother would kind of take on a secondary parent role as in my eldest sisters who raised me and my sister who...(crosstalk) 

00:04:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Two years older. 

00:04:45
DOUGLAS Yeah, two years older than me. (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, so that kind of, I guess, mirrored parent relationship developed. And similarly, when my little brother was born, I kind of became his uhm, caregiver growing up as a kid. Uhm, and so I guess that's how a lot of way that culture was reinforced. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
DOUGLAS Uhm, a lot of traditions weren't necessarily spoken uhm, but looking back at kind of growing up and the decisions I make now I realize that a lot of it was just kind of mirrored behavior that I saw in my own parents... (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
DOUGLAS ...and my older siblings. 

00:05:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
ANIKA K. WARREN  Tell me a little bit about what your parents did as far as work. 

00:05:20
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:05:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
DOUGLAS Uhm, growing up, they worked a lot of different kinds of jobs. Uhm, every ah, from what I remember uhm, my mom worked at a candy factory for a while and fish gutting place for a while... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:30
DOUGLAS  Uhm, early on, my dad kind of was a migrant worker... (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
DOUGLAS ...in the south for a while shrimp, fish, that kind of stuff. Uhm, it wasn't until he moved to Boston shortly before I was born. Uhm, they continued to work that kind of stuff, but as a toddler, I think by the time I was uhm, three or four years old, my father had settled into working uhm, in hardwood flooring.(crosstalk) 

00:05:50
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
DOUGLAS And my mother had settled into working to, in dry cleaning. Uhm, at that time, kind of Vietnamese people were doing that kind of work... (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
DOUGLAS ...in Boston. 

00:06:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
DOUGLAS Uhm, by the time I was in late elementary school, uhm, my parents had, kind of had enough money to open their own little dry-cleaners... (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DOUGLAS ...and since then, may the past eight or ten years, they have been working, earning(ph) their dry-cleaners. 

00:06:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Oh, great. So, you mentioned that uhm, they had a series of jobs, now they are entrepreneurs, they have their own dry-cleaners... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:06:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and they worked extremely hard. How do you think that relates to both their Vietnamese values as well... 

00:06:25
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...as just being political refugees, their work ethic, their work style? (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
DOUGLAS Right. I mean, I think survival was obviously a very big issue... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
DOUGLAS ...just with a larger family... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
DOUGLAS ...uhm, once they moved here starting over again. Uhm, and often I, I think I have been told this many times that uhm, when my parents decided to leave uhm, they've only been married a couple of years when my eldest two siblings were born, and my father basically decided to leave not because of political reasons but more because like many other refugees, more because uhm, he couldn't find work uhm, in Vietnam. And economics was really hard and he couldn't see kind of a future for his two young kids in Vietnam. Initially, my mother didn't want to go... (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:07:05
DOUGLAS ...and uhm, the plan A was him to go with my two siblings and my mother just stay behind. And after a lot of strife uhm, that's when my mother decided to leave. And they left as both refugees in '79. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:07:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, so, really, I guess from the beginning this kind of issue of work was part of their decision. 

00:07:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Yes. 

00:07:20

Beginning to explore potential interpersonal and vocational intersections. 3. Using culturally- appropriate language includes listening to the client and using similar language to that of the client. Career Counseling Skills 1: Theories and Models Theories and Models used in this segment include, but are not limited to: 1. Developing a working consensus and identifying specific areas in which culture may play a role - as described in the Culturally Appropriate Model by Fouad & Bingham (1995). 2. Emphasizing the need for counselors to focus on the personal nature of the client's career by exploring other aspects of the client's life (Savickas, 1993). 3. Understanding that individuals construct their career in unique multileveled social ecological contexts (developmental contextualism) (Savickas, 2002). 4. Exploring the extent to which an individual's physical environment, culture, race and ethnic group, family, neighborhood, and schools attended influence his or her career constructions (Savickas, 2002).

00:10:10
ANIKA K. WARREN How do you think your parents' decisions about relocating... (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
ANIKA K. WARREN ...to the U.S. and the decisions about what jobs they took and what they could perform?(crosstalk) 

00:10:20
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:10:20
ANIKA K. WARREN How do you think that's affected you and how you see work? 

00:10:25
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. Uhm, I think the way I see my own work and the decisions in my life are very much similar to this parallel but I guess under different priorities. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
DOUGLAS Uhm, they are a lot more traditional so really their priority was to make a life for their family... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
DOUGLAS ...it's kind of garner security for themselves and their family. I mean, you know, the five of us. (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
DOUGLAS Uhm, we also grew up in Welfare too, I failed to mention that uhm, and receiving a lot of public benefits that helped along the way. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, I guess my, my decision-making, my goals are a little different in terms of I still seek security for myself, I seek security for my parents and... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
DOUGLAS ...my brother and sisters if I need to... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
DOUGLAS ...uhm, because actually because I identify as queer uhm, I never really hoped to have children. (laugh) 

00:11:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Oh, okay. 

00:11:10
DOUGLAS And uhm, my own family is kind of, I guess the priorities are different. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, security is still the goal but for different uhm, mean... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
DOUGLAS ...different(ph), I guess. 

00:11:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:11:15
DOUGLAS  Yeah. 

00:11:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. You mentioned that you identified as queer... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:11:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...could you tell me a little bit about what the means to you? 

00:11:25
DOUGLAS Sure uhm, as you know, I'm gay. I have issues, relations, relationships exclusively with men. 

00:11:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
DOUGLAS  Uhm, why I use the word "queer" is I guess it means a lot more for me. It's shorter than saying a gay or LGBTQ... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
DOUGLAS Uhm, (laughs) but also, I guess my life is different because of that. I think, you know who I decide, who I choose to have relationships with is kind of uhm, not terribly important but kind of where that fits. I know I just go with how I run my life that makes a difference uhm, I understand marginization on a very different level. I think because I am gay, because my family is all straight I think, and I understand my own gender differently too... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
DOUGLAS ...and uhm, like I said for my, what I considered with my family and my long-term goals in life isn't to get married to have kids. It's not very uhm, heteronormative in that way. 

00:12:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:12:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Interesting. how long have you identified as queer? 

00:12:20
DOUGLAS I've known that, you know, I was queer or gay since I was about 12. 

00:12:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
DOUGLAS So ever since then I have been pretty out about it with my friends uhm, and was only my co-workers but not my family. Just uhm, eventually I told my sisters and my... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DOUGLAS ...older brother. 

00:12:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay, and your younger brother? 

00:12:35
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Not yet? 

00:12:35
DOUGLAS He might have known but I haven't told him. 

00:12:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:12:35
DOUGLAS  Right. 

00:12:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Your parents aren't aware? 

00:12:40
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:12:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:12:40
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:12:40
Career Counseling Skill 2: Discussion Questions 1. What are your reactions to the client and how might your reactions benefit and challenge the counseling relationship? 2. The client just informed you that he is queer. How do you think his queer identity might relate to his career decisions? 3. What challenges might he face in different occupations if he is "out" at work? 4. What are the benefits of a GLBTQ client being "out" at work? 5. What are the challenges and benefits of not being "out" at work in various occupations? Career Counseling Skill 2: Comments and Questions Super's hallmark is that career development is a process of making several decisions, which culminates in vocational choices that represent an implementation of one's self-concept. Considering what you know about the client's life transitions from birth to death roles, social determinates, and personal determinates, where would you locate the client on Super's dimensions of the life Career Rainbow? Using Super's lexicon, explore how the following terms related to what the client has shared thus far? Life course - the meaning sociologists inscribe on career when they define it as a sequence of occupations in the life of an individual. Social role - the duties and rewards a culture assigns and ascribes to its members based on variables such as sex and race. Life - denotes the collection of social roles enacted by an individual, as well as the cultural theatres in which these roles are played. Self-concept - a collection of perceptions that are integrated and coherent. Career Counseling Skill 3: Identifying presenting concerns and school and work experiences. 

00:12:40
ANIKA K. WARREN  Identifying presenting concerns in school and work experiences. As a client discusses his presenting concerns, the counselor should begin to understand and explore the client's values, skills, interests, goals, and priorities, as well as a client's thoughts and feelings about their school and work experiences. 

00:15:10
ANIKA K. WARREN You gave me quite a bit of background and I appreciate that information. What I'd like to do now is, I'd like to talk a little bit about what brings you in today. (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:15:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uhm, eventually, what I like to do is find out how some of these different aspects of you, your... (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ANIKA K. WARREN ...Asian-American status, your Vietnamese status, your Buddhist status... (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ANIKA K. WARREN ...your queer status... (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ANIKA K. WARREN  ...might relate to some of the things that bring you in, but let's just start with what brings you in today. 

00:15:40
DOUGLAS Sure. Uhm, you know I've just recently graduated from undergrad... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
DOUGLAS ...about two months ago. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
DOUGLAS Right now, I'm freelancing, balancing a number of jobs in my field ah, which is like community help, community-organizing work. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
DOUGLAS But I've never been to career counseling and I have a lot of questions that are coming up uhm, some decisions that needs to be made about where I wanna go in the near future... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
DOUGLAS ...and what that really means. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
DOUGLAS So that's why I became interested in seeking counseling for that. 

00:16:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. Uhm, what are some of the questions you have about career and work now that you've recently graduated? 

00:16:10
DOUGLAS Sure. Uhm, I know that I have to work. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
DOUGLAS I've been fortunate about a number of opportunities have presented themselves in my field... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
DOUGLAS ...as opposed to having to go do something else than what I trained for. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
DOUGLAS  Uhm, and some issues that are coming up are really ah, kind of, I guess I've always, my personal life and my professional life have always been very entwined. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
DOUGLAS  Ah, when I was in school, my academic life was part of that. Uhm, you know, in school, I did refugee migration studies. I wrote my thesis on the Vietnamese community. I did a lot of gender and sexuality studies. Uhm, so, I always kind of performed and practiced my own identities through... (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
DOUGLAS ...my work. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Your work. 

00:16:45
DOUGLAS  Why I did that was because I didn't really like school and uhm, the only way I could find myself to be motivated was to do a stuff I cared about... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
DOUGLAS ...something I knew about. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
DOUGLAS Uhm, as I continue work, that motivation and that drive uhm, kind of pulls me into that direction of working in Asian-American communities, Vietnamese communities, queer communities uhm, but you know, it's also a bit difficult because it's always difficult kind of processing the person nine to five... 

00:17:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
DOUGLAS ... hardest way also. (crosstalk) 

00:17:15

00:18:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm, interesting. Your, your work does sound like your parents'. You said they always kept multiple jobs. (laughs) I'm wondering, well, how do you feel about these two jobs? Let's talk about the first one at the... (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:18:55
ANIKA K. WARREN ...community-based clinic. Like when you think about that job, what, what comes up for you like? 

00:19:00
DOUGLAS Uhm, I've always uhm, about for maybe as long as since I was about 14 so... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
DOUGLAS ...I guess most of my young adult and adult life, I've always been very closely tied to HIV/AIDS work. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
DOUGLAS  And so it remains important to me to remain in HIV/AIDS work uhm, if I ever leave it, you know, it kind of still be where I started in, probably... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
DOUGLAS ...I will always go back to. Uhm, so as I continue with this uhm, CBO, it's uhm, a shift, I guess. I've been doing very intensive kind of prevention education and community outreach work and community advocacy work with uhm, queer Asian Pacific kind of young people and you know I guess Asian fund the young people overall... (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
DOUGLAS ...uhm, but this shift to kind of more data crunching, more research stuff. Uhm, it allowed me to remain involved in an organization, who remain involved in the work but to delve into something new for me career-wise uhm, I need to leave the other position not because the program is functioning really well but I just had enough of it, I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
DOUGLAS  Uhm, and so I could still remain involved in people-of-color work and HIV/AIDS work... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
DOUGLAS ...uhm, and working with queer communities but I guess on another level... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
DOUGLAS ...uhm, and a kind of a new realm that I know. If I wanna continue in public health, it's really, it's kinda, it will become useful for me to be more familiar with number data. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, my academic training was in anthropology so it's much more qualitative stuff. 

00:20:20
ANIKA K. WARREN If you had to describe three thoughts that came to mind... (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:20:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...what would those three thoughts be about that particular job? 

00:20:25
DOUGLAS Right, uhm... 

00:20:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Three words that would describe like I think. 

00:20:30
DOUGLAS Right. Uhm, I think of advocacy. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
DOUGLAS I think of personal history. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
DOUGLAS  And I think of, I don't know ah, advocacy, personal history, and I mean I guess the word that comes to mind is privilege. (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
DOUGLAS  Uhm. 

00:20:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Could you speak to those. 

00:20:55
DOUGLAS Uhm, yeah. Advocacy meaning throughout the work that I choose to take on in my life uhm, I guess it ties up with privilege and it ties up with personal history (laughs) in a lot of ways. You know, I grew up, I grew up I guess a lot of different experiences uhm, as a refugee uhm, in an immigrant community, in a bicultural and a bilingual kind of experience and as an adult, young adult realizing I was queer and kind of delving, exploring the queer community and my own queer experience. Uhm, these are all experiences of marginization. 

00:21:25
Career Counseling Skill 3: Discussion Questions 1. Why might a counselor ask for background information before discussing a client's presenting concerns or issues? 2. What questions does the client have about counseling? 3. What issues came up as the client discussed his presenting concerns and work experiences? 4. What did you learn about Douglas' current work experiences? 5. What are some of the intersections between his work and personal life thus far? Career Counseling Skill 3: Comments As the counselor gathers information to help the client concretize his feeling and thoughts about his work experiences and career goals, the counselor should reflect on her or his knowledge and awareness about career counseling with GLBTQ, Vietnamese-American. It is also important for the counselor to remain current on readings about career counseling with diverse populations. For clients' with presenting concerns and group-memberships similar to Douglas' see: Chung, Fassinger, Ponterotto, Rivera, & Adachi, Prince, Leong & Hartung, Nghe, Mahalik, & Lowe, Spokame, Fouad & Swanson Career Counseling Skill 4 Concretizing affective and cognitive aspects of the client's work experiences. 

00:21:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Concretizing affective and cognitive aspects of the client's work experience will help the client deepen his understanding of where he is with his career. So that the client feels safe sharing intimate feelings and thoughts, it's important for the counselor to maintain a safe environment for the client which may mean checking in with the client on the direction of the counseling session and exploring challenges that arise based on the information that the client shares. 

00:23:30
ANIKA K. WARREN So, when you think of that job in the community-based uhm, program that you work at... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ...what are some of the feelings that you think about that job if you could label three to five of them? 

00:23:40
DOUGLAS Sure. Uhm, I think of opportunity... (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
DOUGLAS ...I think of uhm, kind of productivity and growth... (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:23:50
DOUGLAS ...uhm, but I also think of uhm, fatigue and ah, self-reflection... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
DOUGLAS ...kind of self-monitoring in that way. 

00:23:55
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh-hmm. And as you say those... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
DOUGLAS Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
ANIKA K. WARREN ...feelings, what's going on for you right now? 

00:24:05
DOUGLAS  Uhm, hmm, I often, I guess now, I mean, I have been out school two months so work's been coming and going uhm, so a day-to-day experience is mostly stress related to work. 

00:24:15
ANIKA K. WARREN  Could you say that again? 

00:24:20
DOUGLAS Day-to-day is mostly stress related to work... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
DOUGLAS ...and the decisions I have to make for my work uhm, where I wanna work, what I wanna do. Uhm, but looking at the kind of reflection that you just asked me to do uhm, I guess it's more kind of opportunity as opposed to stress. And that if I, the ones that kind of manage things and get things under control, it will be really great. But right now, it's stress in terms of the decisions I have to make. And, and uhm, what, what, what jobs I wanna settle, you know. 

00:24:45
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. As you're saying it, I feel this notion of being rushed, like urgency... (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
DOUGLAS Oh, yeah. 

00:24:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...like is, is that going on for you at all or...? 

00:24:55
DOUGLAS Uhm, I mean right now in reality uhm, I'm in two part-time positions uhm, but there's also kind of like a third part-time position at another organization that they'd like to hire me for uhm, and those two part-time positions uhm, both in community-based health work ah, would like to get me on fulltime. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
DOUGLAS And so, right now, I'm really, I mean the reality of today, is that I'm figuring out what I wanna do, who I wanna settle with. Uhm, I've decided for some reason to put off the security of a full-time job uhm, in order to explore these different opportunities. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
DOUGLAS But basically everyone's saying, "You want health insurance, right?" And like, you know, "Why don't you get a full-time job? It makes more sense." So, I guess the stress that's hitting me today in the past couple of weeks is really balancing all these and knowing that I need to make a decision but not wanting to make a decision... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
DOUGLAS  ...about it. 

00:25:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:25:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. There's a few different directions we could go right now. 

00:25:55
DOUGLAS Okay. 

00:25:55
ANIKA K. WARREN One, I'm thinking about just the need to make decisions... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and to adjust to being out of college and this notion of feeling a little anxious, a little stressed, a little rushed about, oh, which way do I go in... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:26:05
ANIKA K. WARREN ...has not wanting to kind of make a decision too soon... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
ANIKA K. WARREN ...wanting to get as much exposure as you can. So I hear that piece, and uhm, I also remembered just a few minutes ago, we talked about what your siblings do... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
DOUGLAS Uh-hmm. 

00:26:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and uhm, how that relates to growing up. Now what I'd like to do is I definitely want to explore both those directions but I wanna kind of see what's feeling good for you right now as far as next things... (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
ANIKA K. WARREN ...to talk about. 

00:26:35
DOUGLAS I think uhm, I'm not, they all seem kind of comfortable. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
DOUGLAS  Uhm, are we talking about my siblings? 

00:26:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:26:40
DOUGLAS Yeah? 

00:26:40
ANIKA K. WARREN  So talk, okay. Which ever way is most... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:26:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...comfortable for you... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:26:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...or would you like me to decide? 

00:26:50
DOUGLAS You can decide. Yeah, either any way is fine, you can decide. 

00:26:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. Well, I will be back to the siblings... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:26:55
ANIKA K. WARREN ...but let's think how can we integrate the two. Maybe one thing we could do is talk about how feeling rushed or anxious or stressed... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
ANIKA K. WARREN  ...might relate to kind of how you perceive your siblings as making similar decisions. 

00:27:10
DOUGLAS  Sure. 

00:27:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Does that make sense to you? 

00:27:15
DOUGLAS Yeah, definitely. 

00:27:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:27:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, my siblings, my three older siblings, my youngest brother is still in high school. My eldest brother is in business, my older sister is in, she's an architect... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
DOUGLAS ...my other sister is a schoolteacher. 

00:27:25
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
DOUGLAS Uhm, so those are very set professions. 

00:27:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
DOUGLAS Uhm, really, my parents don't really understand what I do in terms of my community organizing background particularly but definitely around public health. 

00:27:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
DOUGLAS Uhm, they don't really know why I'm doing it. 

00:27:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:27:40
ANIKA K. WARREN  ... so let's go back to your siblings and we're gonna relate this to you as well. 

00:27:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ANIKA K. WARREN So, your older brother, he's in business... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...so, did he major in business and then go straight in? 

00:27:50
DOUGLAS Yeah, he majored in business. Uhm, you know, graduated and went right into, I don't really understand what he does (laughs) but it's in business investment or something or other. 

00:28:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay, and then your sister who's an architect, (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
DOUGLAS Uh-hmm. 

00:28:00
ANIKA K. WARREN  ...did she major in Architecture and then go straight? 

00:28:05
DOUGLAS Majored in architecture, went, went right into four years' masters and she's about to get certified. She's been working for three years now outside out of school. 

00:28:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay, and then your sibling that's a teacher... (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
ANIKA K. WARREN ...could you say a little bit about what she did in school and how she... (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
DOUGLAS Sure. 

00:28:15
ANIKA K. WARREN ...transitioned into teaching? 

00:28:15
DOUGLAS  Uhm, she went to Liberal Arts college. She majored in Education and History. Now, she's teaching History. (laughs) 

00:28:20
ANIKA K. WARREN  Okay. 

00:28:25
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:28:25
ANIKA K. WARREN So, how do you think that bit of information might relate to your feeling of stress, anxiety, needing to rush... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:28:30
ANIKA K. WARREN ... and also your parents' confusion as you described that they're not quite clear about what you do or how that relates to... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:28:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ... being an anthropology major or your thesis... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:28:40
ANIKA K. WARREN ...or some of your interest. How do you think knowing where you are... (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...right now two months out versus where your siblings are might be influencing how you feel? 

00:28:50
DOUGLAS I mean, uhm, it's funny because when I graduated uhm, my family's mostly still in Boston. They were like, "Come back to Boston. You don't have a job." But actually, I had enough freelance jobs and I was also in community health and also freelancing in theater, something else I do... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
DOUGLAS ...on the side as a senior, as a technician. 

00:29:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:29:05
DOUGLAS  So I had income that was fine and I knew that I wanted to stay in New York because all my opportunities were here, my life was here, my home is really more here now in terms of my own life. 

00:29:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, but even my siblings don't really understand why I was deciding to stay in New York. Maybe I could go back to Boston and find jobs elsewhere from there. 

00:29:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
DOUGLAS Uhm, I think they'd support me in the work that I do uhm, but I don't think they will really understand it. 

00:29:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
DOUGLAS  And definitely my parents don't. Uhm, and so you know, ah, my parents gave us, we were all very independent growing up each one of, I think. 

00:29:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
DOUGLAS My parents always let us make decisions for ourselves... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
DOUGLAS ... kind of with their guidance. 

00:29:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
DOUGLAS Uhm, although they never quite understood what I do, they never stopped me from doing it. They might have, you know, talked to me about it like giving me some negative feedback but they always, I always knew I can make the decisions that I wanted to make and they wouldn't stop me. (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
DOUGLAS  Ah, nevertheless, I never really feel like I have their support all the time. 

00:30:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
DOUGLAS Uhm, it would be, I think it would be healthier for me if I could talk to them about my work, I know that my brother and sisters can talk to them about their work. 

00:30:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
DOUGLAS Uhm, in a way I can because I kind of don't have the knowledge to talk to them about it. 

00:30:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, they don't really understand why their son is doing social kind of work. 

00:30:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
DOUGLAS Uhm, in the past, when I've done more kind of queer-related work, I'm not out to my parents so obviously talking to them about working for an LGBT health office or working for, I don't know, a career-organizing group. 

00:30:30
ANIKA K. WARREN  Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
DOUGLAS It doesn't really make sense. They don't even know their son is queer. 

00:30:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:30:35
DOUGLAS Yeah, so there's a lot of barriers, I guess. 

00:30:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Several barriers. I wanna kind of touch on each of those things. Uhm, we won't be able to do all of it in this session here. 

00:30:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uhm, I do want to get to the piece particularly around your parents... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...not knowing that you're queer... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ... and the fact that you do queer work and how you engage them in discussion. 

00:30:55
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:30:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uhm, but before we begin there, I wanna go back to something else that you said. 

00:31:00
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
ANIKA K. WARREN You mentioned that uhm, your parents had allowed you to make many decisions on your own... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:31:05
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and that you've been relatively independent, and you also mentioned not receiving a certain level of support from them. 

00:31:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
ANIKA K. WARREN What do you really want from your parents? 

00:31:15
DOUGLAS Uhm, it's always been this way or at least uhm, I've been independent really since I moved here for school fours year ago. 

00:31:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
DOUGLAS  Uhm, it means taking care of myself, working for myself. Uhm, so I don't really seek that kind of financial or whatever. I can take care of my self-support... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
DOUGLAS ...uhm, but I kind of just, I want them to acknowledge and understand where I'm coming from and who I am as a person. I guess in a way, we're very close uhm, in the family structure of like the five kids uhm, really, when it comes down to it. You know, when something happens, when there's a family crisis, the kids are called in to support their parents uhm, and in choosing me and my eldest sister who raised me... (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm. 

00:32:00
DOUGLAS ...uhm, her name is Madeline, the architect. 

00:32:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
DOUGLAS We're the two that they're calling on as opposed to the other ones. Ah, we're the even children, numbers two and four... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
DOUGLAS ...as opposed to five, three and one. 

00:32:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
DOUGLAS Ah, so we're kind of the secondary parents. 

00:32:15
ANIKA K. WARREN And there was some relevance to even versus odd? 

00:32:15
DOUGLAS No, just coincidence. (laughs) 

00:32:15
ANIKA K. WARREN It's a coincidence in your family... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
DOUGLAS Yeah, coincidence. 

00:32:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...okay. 

00:32:20
DOUGLAS It's easier that way... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Okay. 

00:32:20
DOUGLAS ...there's so many of us. Uhm, So yes, my sister and I, uhm, we're kind of the backup, we're kind of back-up support back-up parents and, and I'm willing to give anything and everything for my family... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DOUGLAS ...uhm, without a doubt but I wish there was, so in that I guess in that realm in my life there's a lot of clear communication. They depend on me very much. You know, when they grow older traditionally, they will move in with the eldest son but because they don't wanna move, live with him, they plan and reminded me that they will live with me and my family. 

00:32:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, I don't really have a problem with that but I'm not able to communicate with them about my personal life, my intimate life, my sexuality. Uhm, I'm not able to communicate with them about my work life. Uhm, and so, except for these barriers, we're very close on a, I don't know on some level... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
DOUGLAS ...but then not close in another level. 

00:33:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. That's so complex what you're sharing. I, I wanna know first ah, what's it like to be close to your parents... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
ANIKA K. WARREN ... but not to be able to share all of who you are. 

00:33:20
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:33:20
ANIKA K. WARREN What's that like for you? 

00:33:20
DOUGLAS  Uh hmm. Uhm, it's very stressful in a lot of ways. 

00:33:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
DOUGLAS And obviously, I still, I feel very comfortable at home uhm, and with my family. I feel very close to my parents... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
DOUGLAS ...uhm but, I guess very early on, and I, ah, looking back of one of my coping strategies, I guess that my parents instilled in me two-ism, a kind of division. 

00:33:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
DOUGLAS I'm growing up because we grew up in a very strong culturally Vietnamese family but did not live in a Vietnamese neighborhood... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm 

00:33:50
DOUGLAS ...and my parents didn't really want us associating with other Vietnamese people... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
DOUGLAS ... in the city. Uhm, I learned kind of the division between home life and outside life, (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm 

00:34:00
DOUGLAS ... private and public life. And I know what that meant, and I still practice it to this day. When I realized that I was gay... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
DOUGLAS ...that uhm, there had to be a division between, once again between my public life and my private life... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
DOUGLAS ...uhm, I kind of did the same thing. 

00:34:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. In many ways you did, (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:34:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...there was a division. There's not a division in the interest or how... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...they overlap as far as content... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:34:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...but there's division as... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
DOUGLAS In part. 

00:34:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...far as you share and what you practice with whom. 

00:34:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:34:30
ANIKA K. WARREN So, uhm, you mentioned you know feeling close to your parents but there being a division... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and later you've talked a little bit about how they're gonna move in with you and your family. 

00:34:40
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:34:40
ANIKA K. WARREN I think that's very interesting. I'm wondering how do you see that becoming an issue? 

00:34:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
ANIKA K. WARREN The fact that they wanna move in with you and your family that they expect you to provide for them... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:34:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...given your field of choice... (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and also your queer status. 

00:34:55
DOUGLAS Right. I mean obviously, I work in non-profit so finances are kind of scarce. 

00:35:00
ANIKA K. WARREN  Right. 

00:35:05
DOUGLAS Uhm, nevertheless, uhm, if they did choose to move in with me and they'd expect me to support them, I would take it on.

What other direction could the counselor have gone in at this point? Career Counseling Skill 5 Helping the client examine how social roles and expectations intersect with work-family challenges. 

00:35:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Helping the client examine how social roles and expectations intersect with work-family challenges will assist the client in identifying appropriate career options. When examining the client's social roles and expectations, it is important that the counselor not assume that autonomy or affluence are primary decision-makers, that career maturity is linear or that career self-efficacy or career opportunities are equally available to all people. 

00:36:30
ANIKA K. WARREN  How do you see yourself in the short term... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ...as far as talking to your parents about your career choices, (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
ANIKA K. WARREN ...talking to your parents about your personal choices? 

00:36:40
DOUGLAS Okay. Right. Uhm, you know, like I said earlier, there's always been a division between my private life at home and my public life everywhere else. 

00:36:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, I've been working HIV/AIDS work for six years now. Most of my, all of my adult calendar (laughs) life... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
DOUGLAS ...and yet my family never knew about it until a year ago. Uhm, I have, I have a very close, personal experience with HIV/AIDS and that's kind of what sparked my, my work in it... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
DOUGLAS ...many years ago or several years ago. Uhm, and it was last year when I took on you know, working with HIV/AIDS CBO that I told them, "Oh yes, I'm working on an HIV/AIDS CBO." I just mentioned that I was working HIV/AIDS work, never mind sexuality-based work or queer-based work... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
DOUGLAS ... which is all very taboo culturally for my family. 

00:37:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
DOUGLAS Uhm, that was a really big step just telling them where I worked. Usually, I told them I worked but I may have given an alias... (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
DOUGLAS ...or I didn't really specify, I just said health, (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
DOUGLAS ...health is fine. And obviously, they were like, they were very upset with me. 

00:37:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
DOUGLAS  My siblings were all very supportive but they're very upset. They thought I would become HIV positive, I would catch AIDS, that uhm, they're like, "It's fine you're doing health but why don't you work in like cancer or something?" 

00:37:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm. 

00:37:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, and right now, where I'm facing, and oh, they know that I continue to work part-time with HIV/AIDS CBO in addition to working at something more prestigious like the NYU School of Medicine. Uhm, and I've told them both they're trying to hire me fulltime, they really want me to take up something fulltime but they're like, "Get the NYU job, don't, don't work at HIV/AIDS job." Uhm. 

00:38:10
ANIKA K. WARREN What do you think that's about? 

00:38:10
DOUGLAS  Uhm, that's about kind of HIV/AIDS stigma, sexuality stigma... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
DOUGLAS ... uhm, non-profit work... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
DOUGLAS ...versus academic work. 

00:38:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
DOUGLAS Uh hum. 

00:38:20
ANIKA K. WARREN So when you think about that stigma, (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:38:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ... uhm, and their concern about what's appropriate and what looks most appropriate... (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
ANIKA K. WARREN ...working in NYU versus working at a community-based HIV... (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
DOUGLAS  Right. 

00:38:35
ANIKA K. WARREN ...program, how do you think that might translate into how they will receive you? 

00:38:40
DOUGLAS I think it translates very, very directly. (laughs) Uhm, in a way, I understand where they are coming from but I can't help but feel a little hurt by the way they would like me to set my priorities as opposed to where I set my priorities. 

00:38:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, I think it's very clear and the feeling to me is very, it's not on the surface but it still very visceral... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
DOUGLAS ... when I know how to feel about it. I mean, I just got this part-time position that I know will become full-time very soon if I choose for it to be... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
DOUGLAS ...and I'm like ah, how am I gonna tell them that I opted. And honestly, I have lied to them, kind of kept things from them through much in my adult and young adult life about my sexuality, about my career choices, about my relationships... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm. 

00:39:20
DOUGLAS ...uhm, and for a couple of days I was like maybe if I just tell them that I took the NYU job, they'd be happier, they wouldn't know, they never come down here, uhm, but as of you know two days ago, I decided no, that's not just healthy, it's a waste of everyone's time. 

00:39:35
ANIKA K. WARREN So what you're really talking about is deciding how you wanna choose your life as a queer person... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:39:40
ANIKA K. WARREN ...both professionally and personally? 

00:39:40
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
ANIKA K. WARREN So, do I live a lie... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:39:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and protect myself and my family... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:39:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...if I'm hearing you right... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DOUGLAS Yes. 

00:39:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...or do I tell the truth and come out... (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:39:50
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and take that risk? 

00:39:50
DOUGLAS Yes. So many parallels. 

00:39:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Right. And with that risk, it's very scary because it could affect the closeness... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and it also sounds like from how you're describing your parents, that like most parents uhm, all around the world, they want what's right and what's best for their children... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:40:10
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and they have of an idea of what that is... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
DOUGLAS Absolutely. Yeah. 

00:40:10
ANIKA K. WARREN ... and it may be different from what you want to do... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:40:15
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and what you see is best. 

00:40:15
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
ANIKA K. WARREN So it really sounds like you're really torn. 

00:40:20
DOUGLAS Right, and if and when I told them that I took an HIV/AIDS job, uhm, they wouldn't cut off communication, they wouldn't cut me out of their life but you know, uhm, they'd nag me about it every time I came home or called over the phone. Uhm, they'd be very passive-aggressive about that... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
DOUGLAS ...uhm, and I mean, if and when, when I come out to them, if I do come out to them, I guess eventually, uhm, they may cut me out kind of on a close level... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
DOUGLAS ...uhm, or they may kind of cut me out, out of their life, out of the family uhm, but I think more likely I will continue to be part of the family. Uhm, what they expect from me probably won't happen anymore, they won't wanna live with me anymore uhm, but that really closeness, uhm, really being their kind of like second-hand man of the family... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
DOUGLAS ...will be lost. And what's, I don't, and the fear and loss I have I can associate with that, isn't so much me losing them but them cutting me out and me no longer being able to support them. 

00:41:20
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
DOUGLAS I don't know if that makes sense. I guess, usually people would be like, oh no, I'd lose my parents, but for me honestly, it's more like oh, no, I won't, they won't let me support them anymore so what are they gonna do. 

00:41:30
ANIKA K. WARREN Wow, so it's sounds like for you, making these career decisions, it's really about wanting to keep part of the role and part of the expectations and wanting to maintain that... (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
ANIKA K. WARREN ...for your parents, like that's part of your identity. 

00:41:40
DOUGLAS  Yeah, yeah. I guess so. 

00:41:45
ANIKA K. WARREN So, if we talked about career decisions, and we talked about how that related to both your status as Vietnamese person, Asian-American person... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and as a queer person, uhm, one thing that it seems to be very paramount in the interpersonal piece of that parent-child piece is... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:42:05
ANIKA K. WARREN ...if you will ever share, if you will ever come out. 

00:42:10
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:42:10
Career Counseling Skill 5: Discussion Questions 1. How might the client's group membership as a male, Asian, Vietnamese-American, queer, and/or Buddhist have influenced the client's understanding of his career development and identity? 2. How might the client's group membership as a male, Asian, Vietnamese-American, queer, and/or Buddhist have influence the extent to which his work and family challenges intersect with one another? Saving Face is defined as the avoidance of loss of face and is very important in some Asian cultures. It may lead to clients using elaborate, subtle, and complex communication patterns that some counselors may perceive as indirect. 1. How might saving face influence the client's career concerns, choices and decisions? 2. How might saving face influence the client's response to the counselor's questions and the career counseling process? 3. How might saving face influence the client's decisions to share his queer status with his parents? Career Counseling Skill 6 Exploring themes presented in counseling. 

00:42:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Exploring themes presented in counseling will help the client acknowledge how various factors intersect with their presenting concerns. Often times, people come to career counsel without acknowledging how social, cultural, familial, emotional, psychological, and other factors contribute to their presenting concerns. 

00:43:40
ANIKA K. WARREN What do you want them to know about your work... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
DOUGLAS Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and your education that they don't know or understand? 

00:43:45
DOUGLAS  Uhm, fundamentally, I want my work, because my work, their work always meant a lot to them, my work means a lot to me for different reasons. Their work meant survival, it meant taking care of their family, fulfilling their role. My work means the same thing but on different terms. It means making something of myself, making my own life, but also staying committed to the what I care about. 

00:44:10
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm. Can I add a piece? 

00:44:15
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:44:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Your work like their work sounds like it's also about survival and family if you think of your... (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
DOUGLAS Sure. Yeah. 

00:44:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ... Asian family, your queer family... (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
DOUGLAS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:20
ANIKA K. WARREN ...and survival, you're working with HIV/AIDS... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
DOUGLAS Right. 

00:44:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ... and, and it's not that... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:44:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ...wow, that's a powerful word, yes. 

00:44:25
DOUGLAS Yes. 

00:44:25
ANIKA K. WARREN  In some ways, it does overlap it's just not as clear. 

00:44:30
DOUGLAS Right. Uhm, and so my work means a lot to me and I guess above anything else. What I want from my parents is kind of an acknowledgment on their part of that meaning. I guess, my work, my life my dedication having meaning in their eyes. 

00:44:50
ANIKA K. WARREN Hmm. 

00:44:50
DOUGLAS Uhm, I guess until that comes, there will always be that kind of division between us. 

00:44:55
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:44:55
ANIKA K. WARREN So, so you want them to kind of understand the relevance of your work for you? 

00:45:00
DOUGLAS Right. And they understand why it's important but I mean, because they understand the need for social-oriented work thicker.(ph) I know they utilize city services, welfare, and stuff but they don't really know why I should be doing it. 

00:45:15
ANIKA K. WARREN Right. And I think from what you're saying, it sounds also like that's really about them not knowing about your queer status. 

00:45:20
DOUGLAS About, yeah. Yeah, I think that's part of it... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Yeah. 

00:45:25
DOUGLAS ...but also even if, even if I was doing like labor organizing, they'd be like, "What are you doing?" 

00:45:25
ANIKA K. WARREN  Right. 

00:45:30
DOUGLAS Even though they grew up working poor and on welfare, you know what I mean? So I think it's kind of, they understand why this work exists, they just don't know why I'm doing it. 

00:45:35
ANIKA K. WARREN Right. 

00:45:35
DOUGLAS  And they see me less because of that, I think. 

00:45:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Do you, do you understand how uhm, they're, they're knowing more about, your sexual orientation... 

00:45:45
DOUGLAS Hmm. 

00:45:45
ANIKA K. WARREN ...might relate to uhm, they're, they're seeing why this work is relevant for you or why didn't they're not able to make that connection? 

00:45:55
DOUGLAS Uhm, I think, I don't think that there's a direct connection in what you're saying but I think, I guess it's part of it. Uhm, I'm not, not all my work is queer-based uhm... 

00:46:05
ANIKA K. WARREN Right. 

00:46:05
DOUGLAS ... and out of this latter(ph)overlaps, you know, it creates entity and uhm, the decisions that I make and, and the relationship with my family and the decisions I make at work. Uhm, I don't know, I guess it's not as direct. I think it's part of many pieces of my, my sexuality. 

00:46:25
ANIKA K. WARREN Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, well, of course. 

00:46:25
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:46:25
ANIKA K. WARREN So that's a part of you... 

00:46:25
DOUGLAS Uh-hmm. 

00:46:25
ANIKA K. WARREN ... but there are so many other parts of you that drive your work. 

00:46:30
DOUGLAS Right, right. 

00:46:30
ANIKA K. WARREN And you, you want, you think they understand many aspects of those? 

00:46:35
DOUGLAS Uhm, I don't think so. 

00:46:35
ANIKA K. WARREN  So there's still some gap. 

00:46:40
DOUGLAS Right, yeah. 

00:46:40
ANIKA K. WARREN Do you hear what I'm saying? There are some gaps... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
DOUGLAS Yeah. 

00:46:40
ANIKA K. WARREN ...between how you see yourself and how they see you. 

00:46:45
DOUGLAS Uh-huh. 

00:46:45
ANIKA K. WARREN That might be influencing their inability to understand why this work is calling you. 

00:46:50
Career Counseling Skill 6: Questions 1. What did you notice? 2. What questions would you ask next? Why? 3. What career counseling skills, techniques or strategies would you consider using next? 4. What other themes might you consider processing with Career Counseling Skill 6: Comments In my work with Douglas, his "parents" emerged as significant individuals who should be considered as he makes personal and professional decisions. Helping the client explore the intersections and gaps among work and family will increase the client's self-awareness, which will ultimately improve the client's ability to benefit from career counseling.
