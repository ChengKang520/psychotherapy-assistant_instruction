TERRY B. GUTKIN Umm… I'm gonna approach as I think from a different, uh, kind of angle. Umm… see if I can start my stopwatch so I can kind of keep track on how much time I am using. Umm… as the title says, "Assessment in the service of clinical practice: where do we go from here?" Uh, I'm going to be very selfish about this. I'm coming at this as a clinician, as a school psychologist, as a user of tests. I'm not a psychometrician, although occasionally, I have played one in the university classroom, but the, uh, the truth is that is not what I do. I'm, I'm a school psychologist, and somebody who works with practice problems all the time. And that is really, uh, the angle that I want to, uh, take. And, and why this is relevant to hear? Because I have a very strong sense that clinical practice can only be as good as the measurement technology that we have. To me, practice, clinical practice is directly tied to data gathering. And data gathering is tied to measurement. And measurement brings me here to this conference. It's all about measurement. Or as Cecile(ph) told me many decades ago, in a phrase that resounds through my head and never leaves me, "In God we trust, all others must have data." And that is something I tried to live by. So I am going to try to… really when I put this together, I started from the point of, as a practitioner, as a clinician, as somebody who is not a psychometrician, what are the practice needs that I experience in the field? What would really move our practice forward? And my assumption is that this practice cannot move forward unless the measurement advances are in place to help that practice move forward. And that's what I really want to focus on. So umm… I, I have reduced this to three questions, or the three foci, that I want to take a look at. I want to explore those and then we'll try to talk about what some of the measurement implications are. Uh, changing the unit of analysis. I'm not talking about a psychometric unit. I'm talking about the way we have traditionally approached psychological services, certainly school psychological services. I'm going to focus primarily on schools and kids 'cause that's where I live, but there's nothing that about this talk that is unique to schools and kids. Umm… we have traditionally focused on what has been referred to as the "medical model." How am I doing with the PowerPoint? Pretty impressive, right? Yes. Unbelievable. I didn't think I could do it. Umm… I couldn't quite make the animation. I changed it etcetera, but, uh, to boil down what we have basically always been looking at, we've always kind of been focusing on this idea that what human beings do is primarily a function of the person, and really to a much lesser extent, a function of the environment. Umm… I tried to capture that in the big print versus the little print. I didn't want to make the little print too little, 'cause you might not see it. So it really should be even smaller. But quoting from the, from the DSM itself in the introduction, it says, "Whatever it's original cause, it must currently be about a manifestation of behavioral, psychological or behave or biological dysfunction in the individual." It's… we, we have become a science of what's going on in the individual. And I'm certainly not going to dismiss that as important, as unimportant rather. But there is an alternative which is an ecological perspective, which, when I draw it up looks something like this. Umm… That behavior is a function of the person as it interacts with the environment. And the big letter there is the X, because the X is the interaction. And that's really where the key is. So key theorists here, you probably are aware of Urie Bronfenbrenner is the major theorist, who talks about interlocking social and environmental systems, microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems and macrosystems. Uh, going back as far as Kurt Lewin, Roger Barker, Albert Bandura, certainly somebody who would describe to this orientation. Dante Cicchetti, a little more contemporary. Umm… and there's been a lot of work in the professions also about trying to translate this into professional terms. I've written a lot about this. I have a chapter in my favorite handbook, schools like the fourth edition on ecological approaches to school psyche. There is a book in counseling psychology written by Conyne and Cook, called Ecological Counseling. And the next slide comes from to, umm… clinical psychologist. And this comes from a publication in the American psychologist in 2007. And they concluded, "Most (if not all) mental disorders appear to be the result of a complex interaction of an array of interacting biological vulnerabilities and dispositions with a number of significant environmental, social and psychosocial events." And that is was written by Widiger and Trull So the center here is that both the person and the environment are crucial, but neither one of sufficient to understand human behavior. If we're just looking at the person or just looking at the environment, it's not enough. We need to be looking at the interaction, which is the key. I'm kind of picking up a little on what Jane was, uh, talking about. There has been a lot of work now in the area of genetics, uh, not that I read genetics, uh, journals, on all that often a basis. Uh, but work by Rusk(ph) and Rusk(ph), I'm aware of, and, and many others, that say that even with genetics, it's not just the genes you're born with. The environment that you are in turns on or turns off the genes that you have. So you, of course we need to understand the genetics and all that biochemical stuff that Jane can't pronounce and I can't pronounce either, and I won't even attempt to. But if you don't understand the environmental context within which that occurs, you kind of are missing the picture. I think that's the argument I'm making here on this first point. So what is the unit of analysis? As a school psychologist, again, I think this is equally true for all branches of psychology, but I'm just gonna talk about school psyche and working with kids. Here's the unit of analysis, umm… a student. And we have developed a mountain, a mountain range of tests and procedures so that we could figure out what is going on inside that little oval from the brain to everything else that's in there. And that's where we get focused. I want to suggest we're missing just a tad here, because I think that's actually the reality. That is what really goes on with human beings regardless of what's going on inside of them. Certainly this is what goes on with kids. It's not just the child, we all know this. It's the home, it's the school, it's the extended family. I'm reading them only 'cause I want to make sure you can read them. Society, community, peers, and a million other things that aren't mentioned there. They all interact with the student. They all interact with each other, and it goes on and on and on. What we're dealing here with is, dealing here with is really a living substance, a living system, rather. So this kind of picture, umm… number one, I think is a much more accurate picture of reality. If we're trying to understand human behavior, it is at least my belief that this is a much more accurate, and I see if the back works. Oh, unbelievable. Oh. This is where we mostly spend our time, this is what we really need to be thinking about for all the headaches that it's gonna give us. A diagram like this really helps us understand, uh, recidivism, for example, with substance abusers. You can do all you want with this person and fix them, and get their head straight, and take care of them, and get the right medicines in them, and change their brain function, and da-da-da-da-da. And they go back home and bang, they're back on drugs. It starts again. Umm… this also, in my mind, helps me understand why do we have such a rash of eating disorders among young women in our country. Bulimia, anorexia, etcetera. Umm… I think we're looking at the reasons because of all the forces that are surrounding everybody. Most importantly, for me, it talks to, as a treatment provider, why that we don't have a stronger connection between diagnosis and treatment. So we come up with all these diagnoses but they are not clearly related to effective the treatment. Because two people that look exactly the same here can look totally different here. And the treatment that works inside the person, doesn't work necessarily in the context. So the treatment has to be, I think, much more sophisticated. And take this into account. So this is the challenge, I think, for clinicians. This is the challenge that we face on a day-to-day, case-to-case basis. And I think this is the measurement challenge, which is why I bring it up here. It's not unrelated to measurement because the tools that we have more help us deal with this. We need tools to help us deal with that. Implications for Assessment and testing in 25 words or less. One is, I think we need an armamentarium of tests that, and measures that help us understand and assess environments. Not just people, but the environments that people live in. The environment… we have to recognize that the environment is incredibly powerful, an incredibly powerful force. We have to get away from an obsession of what, with what Seymour Sarason called, "A psychology of individuals." We are totally focused on a psychology of individuals and we are missing out on the big picture. We need as big and large and sophisticated and diverse an array of measurement instruments to measure environments as we have for people. We have made some small advances in that area. Jim Ysseldyke has a chapter in the handbook of school psychology. Gee, do you all own a copy of the fourth edition of hand book of school psyche? Why don't you own too? You need one in… Its good bathroom reading, I mean, it… Umm… so we really have a need to develop much our focuses here. Secondly, we need to develop an assessment methodology that let us assess and diagnose the interaction between persons and environments. Not just the person, not just the environment, but how people and environments interact with each other. What, how do we measure that? How can we possibly improve our practice if we can't get a handle on measuring that? So it's very clear to me that this is the way forward, umm… for practice. I want to suggest, uh, speaking here at the Burrows Institute, that we spend some more focus on getting contextualized, rather than decontextualized measurements of human beings and human functioning, be it psychological or educational. We need tools, measurement tools to help us with that. Now the good news is, I think, that we are, I think, moving in the right direction. At least within the schools, we have some instruments that are starting to do this. And it is a relatively rudimentary start, but it is a start. Uh, the Functional Assessment of Academic Behavior, FAAB, by Ysseldyke and Christenson. And the MS-CISSAR by Carta, Greenwood, and colleagues. Umm… these instruments all simultaneously took…take a look at students, teachers, teacher behaviors, instructional structure, instructional provision, class environments, and the home environment, and the interaction among all these things. Very messy, very crucial. I don't think we will really fulfill our promise as practitioners and clinicians until we get there. So this is point one. I want to suggest we need to change the unit of analysis. We need to change our, our near obsess of focus on individuals and start seeing people in context. Point two. Two out of three. Responding to the Mental Health and Education Pandemics. I learned the word "pandemic" x number of years ago and I thought, "Gee, what a cool word. I have to use it." I use it all the time now. I love the word. I also like to say inextricable. So I, I'll find some way to make, this is inextricably lecturer. I'll find some way to use this. Umm… I, I want to suggest that this nation, probably the world, but I won't make any case about the world 'cause I just don't know enough about it. But I feel on solid grounds here, that we are in a national crisis in terms of mental health and in terms of education. The problems that we face in the United States in 2010 are huge, absolutely huge. And then when I was thinking that I might say that I realize them in Nebraska and Nebraska is the home of Johnny Carson and when I said, "huge," somebody would yell out, "How huge is it?" See, good, tell me, well, let me tell you how huge it is. So I want to first focus on the general population and then look at children, in particular. So just a series of statistics to tell you how huge it is. Each year, each year, not each decade, each year, 25 percent of Americans have a diagnosable mental health disorder, that's 75 million people, with 60, 60 percent of these being either moderate or severe, that's 45 million people. These statistics come from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, which was done by the National Institute of Mental Health. It is a nationally representative survey of 10,000 people labeled by the director of NIMH as a landmark study. So this is a very important, uh, set of data and gives you some sense of the depth of the problems, breadth of the problems. This comes from the World Health Organization. 85 percent of Americans, which I calculated out, thanks my powerful computer, to be about 63 million people. 85 percent of Americans will not receive mental health care treatment for their diagnosable disorder within a year. 85 will not receive treatment within a year. And 70 percent, 59 million, will never receive specialized mental health care. What is this costing us? Even just financially? $220 billion a year, second, third only to cancer and coronary disease. And does anybody know by the way, I just saw this recently, the most prescribed class and category of medication in the United States. Psychotropic, be more specific, yes. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN Antidepressants. 

00:15:25
TERRY B. GUTKIN Antidepressants. Antidepressants, in 2010, are the most prescribed medications in this country. I think that is telling us something. It's depressing. Anybody got some drugs? So let me move to a few statistics about children and youth. 20 percent of children experience the signs and symptoms of a DSM-IV disorder, each year. That's one in five children, experiencing signs and symptoms of a disorder. 10 percent suffer from mental illness severe enough to result in significant functional impairment. 

00:16:05

00:16:10
TERRY B. GUTKIN 70 percent of children in need of mental health treatment do not receive any such services, from an article in the journal of School Psychology. This next quote comes from a report by the Surgeon General. It's a very thick report, like yay thick. Well, may be not yay thick. It was this thick on my computer but I don't know, really, really, what is if I printed it all out. This was the opening sentence of the summary paragraph. So when they… when the Surgeon General was summarizing the state of mental health care for treatment, this was the opening sentence. The foremost finding is that most children in need of mental health services do not get them. 

00:16:50

00:16:55
TERRY B. GUTKIN To go quickly to the education side and I'm going through a lot of quotes here. A public school student is suspended every second, drops out of school every 11 seconds. And you can see here, the statistics on how well we're doing with educating our children. So I want to suggest… and I think these quotations, at least in my mind, make the case, but business as usual is not really a very good option for us. We keep doing business as usual. But business as usual is not a very good option. The rate of new cases, the increase in incidents is way beyond the rate of cure. We are getting more and more troubled, dysfunctional children and adults, faster than we can possibly cure them. I immediately go to the metaphor of a boat, taking on water. What happens when the water coming into a boat comes in faster than you can bail it out. Ask Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, they'll explain this to you. The boat goes under, it's called Titanic. And that is what really we are facing, if you look at these statistics over a period of time. So where are we going to go? What's the way forward and what does this have to do with measurement, which I am getting to. Our typical approach to educational and psychological problems is trying to cure victims. We wait for people to be victimized. We wait for people to fall apart. We sit around passively, waiting, uh, for them to have all kinds of problems. And then we try to, umm… fix them. We try to cure them. There is a quote from George Allby(ph), which I could run down exactly, I'm gonna paraphrase it, not a direct quote but I definitely have the essence of what he said. "No disease was ever eliminated by treating those who have it." No disease was ever eliminated by treating those who have it and certainly not by treating them one at a time. 

00:19:00

00:19:05
TERRY B. GUTKIN Well, I brought up two points but that's fine. Here's, here's the direction of where we need to go. We need, we need to be shifting towards population-based services and or public health orientation, at least within the field of school psychology, a lot of people. We haven't made this leap in practice but we have made this leap conceptually. I think the field is aware of it. The futures of school psychology conference which was held in the early part of this millennia spent a lot of time focusing on public health, as the orientation under which we need to approach problems. Uh, the blue print in school psychology, posed by Ysseldyke and his colleagues, spends a lot of time on that. I read a very interesting article by a gentleman named Hewbert(ph) in 2009 in the perspectives on psychological practice, an APS journal, not a journal that I read all the time. He basically made the argument, a statistical argument. He took a look at the normal curve, and he said, "If this curve is not where we wanted to be, if the curve of human health, psychological and education is not where we want to be. The way to expand our resources is not by focusing on the tails, the outer extremes of a curve. What we ought to be focusing on is the middle of the curve. It's the middle of the curve." And he statistically laid out how if you can move the middle of the curve, a little bit, a Public Health Orientation, you can have so much more of an impact than if you're busy dealing with the people that are 19 standard deviations below the mean. Which, by the way, we don't have enough respect for the people who are 19 standard deviations below the mean. We always celebrate the people that are way above the mean, but you realize of course, that the normal curve hits the access, supposed to be asintotic, if it hits the access, that's the end of the normal curve. And I don't have to explain to this group that's the end of civilization and life as we know it. So the people that are out there, 12 standard deviations below the mean, do you realize what pressure they have to hold up that crenate? Very, very vital. A, a population service, base service approach is going to include an emphasis on primary and secondary prevention. I think a lot of humpty-dumpty, strangely enough. We are just… talk about diagnosable. Our society, in my opinion, is diagnosable. We have a humpty-dumpty situation and we sit around and we watch humpty-dumpty up on the wall and we say, "Well, look at that. An egg walking on a wall above a concrete surface. Interesting. How's he doing?" "He's still up there." "Oh, there nothing, we don't have to do anything." "Well, he seems to be losing his balance. Has he fallen yet?" "No." "Well, we don't have to do anything." "What do we… Oh, oops." "He fell." Splat. "Oh! Here comes psychology. Let's get in and put him back together again." And, and of course, you know all the king's sources and all the king's men and etcetera. That is the wrong… we are getting in at the wrong time. We need to be dealing with prevention, chapter by Dolack, it's a special issue in the American psychologist on prevention with children. Prevention works. The data are very clear at this point. It's not hypothetical. It's not a theoretical. Maybe it could be, it might. We have a lot of data from a lot of prevention programs and they work. And that is where we need to be putting our resources. And prevention is not enough, because we typically think that if we prevent problems, then we will have cured them. Well, I want to suggest an alternative idea, which is not my original idea by any means, but I read recently in an article by Keyes in Professional Psychology. Basically, eliminating mental health problems is not the same as creating mental health. Those are two separate things. So we not only have to be preventing problems, we need to be promoting psychological and educational health. So what does this have to do with assessment? Why am I bringing this up at a Burrow's conference? 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
TERRY B. GUTKIN For starters, I think we need to expand clinical assessment beyond the diagnosis of individual psychopathology. We are getting in there after the fact and for individual clients. And we are going to be the sinking ship, if we continue to move that way. We need to be focusing on health. We need to be assessing wellness and competence and resilience and flourishing and flow and all those kinds of things. And we need to be assessing environmental characteristics. This would be a huge change. We need to develop a science. We have a science of human dysfunction and a lot of that science of human dysfunction we owe to the measurement community. We owe our knowledge about the science of human dysfunction to the measurement community. We also need a science of environmental functioning. And we need the measurement community to step up the plate and help us figure out how to do that because I don't think we really have that down right now. And we need an assessment that is focused on prevention, rather than dealing with full-blown diseases. And without those assessment techniques, we're not gonna get there. Now there are some instances I think of moving in the right direction, and if it'll come up, there it is. And I'm pleased to say and without any collaboration and as a complete surprise to one of our audience members. One of them is the ClassMaps from Beth Doll. Stand up and take a bow. Yay! This is important work. I'm making light of it, but I don't mean to make light of it at all. This is important work, because this is work that is, is an assessment methodology that is focusing on the environment. It's focusing on the individuals in the environment. It's focusing on class-wide, school-wide kinds of measurements. It is focusing on learning what it is we need to have healthy outcomes and helping us get to these healthy outcomes. So this is a breakthrough. This is moving in the right direction. And it's my honor and privilege to know Beth and to appreciate her work. I just actually bought your other most recent book. I just saw it in an advertisement that went by, "Oh, what a good book." I bought it. This is another instance, I think, of moving forward from the World Health Organization, the international classification of functioning disability and health, the ICF. This is a much broader non-school, non-child focus attempt. This is very much based on ecological conceptualizations of human functioning. It is very much based on trying to get a handle on how we can develop environments that promote health. The thing that is missing…One minute, oh, I'm sure, the whole point. Okay. I'll be quick. The thing that we're, umm… missing here is, is the measurement. I literally just reviewed an article for the Journal of School Psychology about this, and it all makes brilliant conceptual sense but they can't, they have no idea how to measure this stuff. And without the measurement, the science won't go forward. So I… given I've been given the one-minute signal, I'm just going to tell you what the last topic was, even though I won't go through it. What I called, "Moving from Snapshots to Moving Pictures." We are in the business of taking static snapshots of people. Well, I can just show you this slide. What we need is a technology of progress monitoring, performance tracking, formative evaluation. We need a moving picture. In this era of accountability, it's not enough to know where somebody is at the moment and then assign them a treatment. When physicians provide us with treatment, they don't just diagnose us and treat us, they keep gathering data to see if we're actually getting better. What a wild, crazy idea. Performance tracking. So we need to develop a measurement methodology and measurement techniques that are going to allow us to not only take the snapshot but are going to allow us to find out, "Are we making a difference?" And if we're not, to give us a signal to change our direction and change our treatment, and continue to measure outcome to see if we're in fact, moving forward with that. So I had more to say about this but I don't have enough time to do it and lucky for you. So, and anyway, thank you very much. I hope this makes some sense to you. And I hope you can see the implications for measurement, 'cause I know I spent most of my time talking about practice, but without measurement, this is just not gonna happen. We're gonna be standing on the Titanic as it goes down. Thank you.
