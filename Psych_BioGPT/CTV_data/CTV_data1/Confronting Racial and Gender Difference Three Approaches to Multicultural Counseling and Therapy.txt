JUDY DANIELS  Hi. I'm Dr. Judy Daniels and I'm here with two of my colleagues, Dr. Brenda Cartwright and Dr. Michael D'Andrea. And we are excited to be here today to share with you our expertise in terms of multicultural counseling and specifically to look at how does one deal with the difficult challenges and confrontations that can emerge in the context of a counseling relationship particularly when you have differences related to gender and, ah, racial differences. We are, ah, very excited today because we think that this video is going to be a very productive learning experience for you and it's going to be interesting for you to see how the counseling relationship is dealt with in the very beginning. Ah, Dr. Michael D'Andrea is going to be doing a vignette related to, ah, the opening process of the counseling relationship. And so at first, we're gonna see how one deals with at outset some very obvious racial and gender differences in that counseling process. Then, we're going to be, ah, followed by a series of three different vignettes, one which is going to show the, ah, existential humanistic approach, another one that will be looking at the, ah, psychodynamics approach, and a third one that will deal with the cognitive behavioral approach. Now, during these vignettes, we want you to be looking at and thinking about a series of questions. First, for yourself, we want you to pretend like you're the counselor and to be thinking about how would you deal with the obvious differences that you're going to see in terms of the, ah, the, the, racial and gender differences that will be presented at the onset of the counseling process. And secondly, we want you to consider, as a counselor, how would you deal with some of the confrontations that are gonna emerge within the context of this counseling process. So we're excited today to be here and we hope that you enjoy and find this to be a productive, ah, learning experience for yourself. 

00:02:50
Dr Brenda Cartwright 

00:02:50
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I will be role-playing as the client today and I'll be bringing the issue of invisibility, uhm, to my counselor. Uhm, invisibility is, uhm, when you're really disregarded. Ah, you're not seen. An example of invisibility would be, uhm, I'm at the airport and I'm the first person in line. On my right is a White female and on my left is White male. The reservation clerk comes up and says, "Who's next?" when it's obvious that I'm the next person, but I'm not there. Uhm, another example of invisibility would be a person with a disability. Uhm, I may have gone, uhm, shopping with my girlfriend who is deaf-blind and we are getting our purchases together, we go up to the cashier and the cashier asked me, uhm, "How are you paying?" rather than the person who's paying for it, the person with the disability totally disregarded. And invisibility really can be seen not only with persons with disabilities and, uhm, gender and also culturally, racially. Uhm, it's something that, uhm, you're disconnected, and it produces in the person a feeling that you are not credible that you are less then, and it's not a good feeling. Uhm, I'm really excited about, uhm, the process today, uhm, but I'm a bit concerned, ah, two things. I'm not sure that these three approaches can really work, ah, with African-Americans, and I'm not sure that, uhm, about the dynamics that will happen with a White male as my counselor. So, I'm looking forward to how this, uhm, processes out. 

00:04:50
Dr Michael D'Andrea 

00:04:50
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Well, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to be with my colleagues and with you today to demonstrate some of the ways in which we can deal with racial and gender differences in the early part of the counseling process. I understand that dealing with racial and co, gender issues are oftentimes uncomfortable subjects that counselors and psychologists avoid dealing with at the early part of a counseling session. Nonetheless, many multicultural experts insist that these obvious differences need to be addressed in order to begin the process of rapport building and the demonstration that the counselor can extend a sense of genuine empathetic understanding for the client at the early phases of the counseling process. Ah, what we're going to move in to next is a, our first roleplay where we will demonstrate sort of the rapport, some of the rapport building skills that are necessary for any approach, any of the three approaches that one might use to counseling and psychotherapy. While you'll notice in this first roleplay is that the issues of race and gender differences emerge early in the session and need to be addressed before we can move more effectively and respectfully into the important issue of invisibility, the important concerns that are brought forth by this client today. So let's move on and look at our first roleplay together. 

00:06:25
Rapport Building Roleplay 

00:06:25
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Dr. Cartwright, how are you this afternoon? 

00:06:35
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I'm doing good. 

00:06:40
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Good. I'm glad that you were able to be here and, ah, I appreciate the time that we'll have working together. I was able to look over, ah, the intake form that you filled out and I have, ah, some general idea of who you are as a person. Uhm, but this is our chance to, ah, begin to know a little bit more, ah, about each other and I guess I would like to start off by saying what we should prefer to be called when we work together? 

00:07:00
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, Brenda would be fine. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Brenda, okay. I'm Michael, I guess you knew. Uhm, there were some things that, ah, you indicated in your intake, ah, that are of concern to you that, ah, and I guess what I wanted to do first is talk a little bit about counseling and psychotherapy and what it means to you, what it means to me so we have a common basis of understanding that we can work from. Ha, have you ever been in, ah, ah, counseling or psychotherapy yourself? 

00:07:25
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Yes, I have and I've had, uhm, two different experiences. My first one was with a White male and the second one was with a Black female and the second one I was much more comfortable so I'm feeling kind of weary here, with you. 

00:07:45
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay, so you didn't have, ah, a, a, a, a, a very high level of ah, satisfaction in that e, experience I'm gathering from you with a White male therapist? 

00:07:55
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Exactly. 

00:07:55
MICHAEL D'ANDREA And you come here looking me and you're a little bit weary about how this is gonna work out? 

00:08:00
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I certainly hope it works out in a way that's more positive than that experience. Ah, you did mention that working with an African American therapist, ah, in another occasion, what were some of the things that made that particularly helpful and positive for you? 

00:08:15
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I think because we, uhm, come from the same background, uhm, and because she was female. I think that really helped also. 

00:08:20
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Okay. 

00:08:25
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT So the gender difference also plays a part. Uhm, the fact that she was black, uhm, meant that we, she understood some of the things that I was going through and I'm not so sure that you will be able to do that. 

00:08:35
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Yeah, I can see where that would be a, a, a, a, a possible barrier between the work that we do 'coz the journey that we are thinking about taking together, if we decide to go that way, is the journey that looks for ways that you can feel, ah, a greater sense of personal well being. Uhm, it's a way of, of, the, what we say is promoting a greater sense of mental health. Ah, it's looking at intimate and personal issues. And on one level, I could see where being White and being male in your experiences in the past with a person in therapy who is White male, ah, may put you on a little bit of guard right now wondering if this is gonna be worthwhile. On another level, I am aware that racism is pervasive in our society and it's a topic that most white people and many White men that I know personally and professionally choose not to talk about or talk about in very, ah, condescending ways. On top of that, I, I am aware of many of the ways that sexism and heterosexism are perva, pervasive in our society and how men, and particularly White men, are able to benefit from various privileges that women and people of color aren't. Uhm, I hope that my awareness and I think of a good deal of sensitivity about these issues might be a bridge that can help us connect better. 

00:10:05
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah, just your saying that, uhm, you understand and you have some sensitivity makes me feel like maybe we can work together. 

00:10:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. Well, I, I really appreciate you saying that and I, but I want you to also know that part of my job is to make sure that you're receiving the highest quality of service and that doesn't mean that we're not gonna disagree occasionally. It's not gonna me, it doesn't mean that counseling is just a nice and comfortable activity. There will be times that I would challenge you to think in new ways, to encourage you to act in new ways. I wonder if we could start right from the beginning by recognizing that I will also expect you to challenge me or to call shots on me when I say something or do something that may even unintentionally be racist or perceived to be racist from your perspective or to be a narrow male, male perspective, I'm willing to have that kinda ground rules be the foundation that you and I can work together in a very personal kinda journey together. 

00:11:15
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I like that. I think we can work together. 

00:11:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  I do want you to know that as we go through our work together, if you feel that there are some barriers that are insurmountable, you're paying for services, you're committing yourself to making some changes to find ways of feeling better about your life, uhm, if it is not working for you, then you, I want to encourage you to tell me then we can look at possibly referring you to another therapist, possibly a female, possibly someone who understands your racial and cultural background more effectively than I do, and I would work towards that end. But I, I really am looking forward to working with you and I, I think we might be able to stimulate each others thinking in our growth and I look forward to that. 

00:12:00
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah, and you don't have to worry about me challenging you. 

00:12:05
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Good. Good. That gives me a sense of confidence. I'm glad you said that. Ah, you, you also are a faculty member in, ah, the Dep, Department of Psychology? 

00:12:10
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Yes. 

00:12:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA So that's gonna make my job a little bit easier 'coz I'm gonna be able to use some psychological terms and refer to theories that persons who are non-psychology or counseling wouldn't know. And so that, that is helpful. Uhm, you are aware, probably, but I wanna talk about confidentiality briefly, ah, that whatever you say in this room stays in this room. Ah, I'm bound legally and ethically to protect the confidentiality rights except under three conditions: one, being if I think that you might hurt yourself, if someone might hurt you or in our conversations that I feel that you might end up hurting someone else are some of the conditions that I would be required to break confidentiality. And I wanna make sure that you're clear and comfortable before we move forward. 

00:13:05
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, clear. I'm not so sure about comfortable because, you know, trust is something that you earn. So. 

00:13:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay and we're just beginning. 

00:13:10
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yup. 

00:13:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  And we're total strangers coming together in a personal, ah, ah, ah, ah, work here together and, and, ah, I'm looking forward to ways that we can build trust together. Let's start right off by turning the pitcher on me and asking you a simple question. I'm gonna be learning a great deal about you as we work together. Ah, I'm interested in what you would need to know about me, personally and professionally, that might help you develop right from the beginning a sense of trust. 

00:13:45
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, one, ah, concern I have is, uhm, spirituality because that's really important to me, and most white people that I know, uhm, don't, ah, demonstrate, any real, uhm, close, uhm, idea of you know, any kind of, ah, spirituality. So, uhm, do you go to church? 

00:14:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA You know, if, ah, if you asked me 10 years ago at this point, this might, ah, an area that would be a barrier between us because spirituality is so important to you. Uhm, for me 10 years ago, spirituality was not important and my life journey, ah, started off by being, ah, baptized as a Roman Catholic and having a Catholic background in my family upbringing and schools. Ah, I went to college and, ah, I think I saw a number of contradictions in that particular religion that I was practicing that alienated me and calls me to really divorce myself from thinking about spirituality and religion. And I make a distinction between the two. Uhm, as I have grown and continued my life journey, I sit here now today, ah, being a person who has explored and re-awakened to the power of spirit and to the belief that spirit really encompasses, ah, all living and non-living things, uhm, and I find it to be a meaningful and an important source of strength in my own life. And I do oftentimes sees it, see that as a source of strength that many clients that I've worked with, uhm, haven't looked at as carefully as they might in order to achieve a greater sense of well being. 

00:15:30
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I really like the fact that you, uhm, even can call on your ancestors I, I, when you said those were not living 'coz I have a strong belief in that, so yeah. 

00:15:40
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Brenda, I'd be very honest with you. One of the things that's help, helped me in reaching my thinking about spirituality is reading about Black Psychology. Ah, is reading about what's referred to as an African Centered Approach to Mental Health and I find it so different from traditional approaches to psychotherapy and counseling. For instance, besides spirituality, the idea of holism that we are not a mind or a body, uhm, but that we're a, a gestalt of mind, body, spirit ah, who are influenced by the present, the future, and the past. So I really like that idea. I also like the idea of inter-connectedness that's woven into Black Psychology and that's why I do believe that I can work with individuals who come from different cultural backgrounds and yet we can make connections and build bridges. 

00:16:35
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT The fact that you've even read, I don't, I don't even know anyone who will take the time. I mean, that's, that's really great. I think you can be a good counselor. 

00:16:45
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Well, maybe there are things that I have read that I can chat with you and to see how, uhm, how valid you think these ideas are from a Black Psychological perspective, it would help me check my understanding and expand my thinking. 

00:17:00
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:17:00
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Is there anything else about me that would be helpful to again, get to know me as a person, as a therapist? 

00:17:05
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT We've covered the areas that I was really concerned. The fact that there is a gender difference and Black-White issue and the trust and the spirituality. So, I'm feeling really comfortable right now and I think that what I have to share with you, which has to do with, actually, a white male, uhm, that you'll be able to help. 

00:17:25
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Geez, I'm really interested in learning about, ah, the, the issue that you're bringing here today and the concern and particularly 'coz it ties into an interaction apparently you've had with another White male. Ah, before I do though, I'd, I wanted to very briefly, ah, acknowledge some of my biases ah, in our work. So you're aware of where we're going along. The fields of counseling and psychology have gone through tremendous changes. In the past, there has been an emphasis on primarily focusing in on the inner-life of clients, we call that the inter-psychic exploration. As time has going on, there's been an increasing awareness of the importance of working with clients to look at how the environment impacts the inner-life of clients. And when I think of the impact of racism and how pervasive it is and how white individuals intentionally and unintentionally help to perpetuate racism, I can really see where attentions in the environment would be helpful. The third area is connecting both, providing counseling and psychotherapeutic activities that would help clients look within themselves, to develop new ways of thinking, acting, and feeling, as well as working together with a therapist like myself to look at ways that they can make environmental changes. Well, there are three roads we could take on this journey and I wonder which ones might be most appealing to you, the individual or the. (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Definitely the, the last. 

00:18:55
MICHAEL D'ANDREA The last? 

00:18:55
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT The last one. We had looked at both. Uhm, again that's the holistic approach. So, (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Okay. 

00:19:05
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:19:05
MICHAEL D'ANDREA And so, you're interested in our work together as that we take time looking with inside you, how you make sense of the issue that you've brought to the counseling session today, as well as looking at what you or I or what we can do together to make some changes in your environment that will help you acquire a greater sense of satisfaction and well being. 

00:19:25
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT All right. All right. 

00:19:25
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Anything else? (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Don't be isolated. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. And that, that, that works for me and it feels like we have an idea of our game plan, what we're going to do is we move on to look at the issue that you've brought here today. 

00:19:35
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Yeah. 

00:19:40
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Great. 

00:19:40
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Great. 

00:19:40
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Then let's move on. 

00:19:40
Processing the Rapport Building Roleplay 

00:19:40
JUDY DANIELS  What we saw in the first vignette was a sense of setting structure and facilitating rapport amongst the counselor and the client. And we are excited about the first part of the vignette and wanted to check in with our two role players to see how they are feeling about the process. Brenda, I wanted to check with you first. How are you feeling? 

00:20:10
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, I felt really positive about, uhm, my counselor, you know? Uhm, Mike was right on with, uhm, entering all of my concerns like debate about the co, the gender difference and then he went on into that racial issue but then the spiritual, I mean, he just blew me away, really, 'coz I, I didn't expect that. And the fact that he read, had read, go, went beyond the awareness, you know, because not necessarily having hands-on experience with what I was talking about, he had actually read. I mean, that really made me feel like "Okay, this person's really interested in me." 

00:20:50
JUDY DANIELS So it sounds like he put you to ease. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
JUDY DANIELS He had some concerns... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:20:55
JUDY DANIELS ...when you first walked in and I thought it was kind of interesting, you're a professional woman... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

00:21:00
JUDY DANIELS ...in, in, in the field, so you were able to address some of the concerns that some clients might not necessarily be able to just come forth right with and, and say in the beginning. But since you did, he was able to address those and, and, and make you comfortable since there is cultural, racial difference, and gender difference between the two of you. 

00:21:15
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Right. 

00:21:20
JUDY DANIELS That's great. Ah, Michael, how are you feeling about it? 

00:21:20
MICHAEL D'ANDREA I felt good. I felt, ah, very challenged in this situation. Ah, ah, Brenda did such an excellent job of articulating, ah, as you said, a professional individual. Ah, ah, ah, but a professional individual who is strong, who is, ah, seems to be anchored in beliefs. And, ah, ah, it appeared early on in that, in that interaction that both race and gender are salient issues that I would hypothesize at that point, ah, are important parts of her overall identity as a person. In that way, she made it easier for me to deal with the cross-racial, cross-gender differences that characterized this setting, uhm, but it was challenging. (clears throat) 

00:22:05
JUDY DANIELS And if she again brought those forward, how might you have approached this situation? Would you still have, have, have dealt with some of those issues in the first session? 

00:22:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Well, Judy, you know that, ah, this is one of the real taboos in counseling and psychotherapy where numerous theories, ah, and practitioners in the field have talked about, ah, ah, not really thinking it's appropriate to grapple with the difficult issue of race and gender differences, ah, sexual, ah, orientation, ah, differences that might exist between the individuals, and our writings and our research have well documented the importance of dealing with these differences very early in the first session, ah, in order to develop a sense of trust, ah, develop a sense of ease and, ah, between both the client and the therapist. So if she had not introduced it, I would have felt that my ethical responsibility from a culturally competent perspective to bring the issue up and to explore it with Brenda. 

00:23:05
JUDY DANIELS  Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Otherwise, I begin to impose my own biases, ah, on the individual client, trying to help Brenda in a way that I think, ah, she could be helped. What I was demonstrating at that point where we talked about the junctures or the different roads that we could take and negotiating with Brenda, how are we gonna work together? And I'm very clear that we will proceed with a focus on intrapsychic and environmental issues, ah, as, we call that a co-construction process, building a partnership with the client and the therapist to get a better idea of how these two individuals make meaning of counseling, helping, and psychotherapy and moving together as partners who are aware and respectful of each other's views on those particular issues. 

00:23:55
JUDY DANIELS One of the things I thought you did particularly well was, was bridging, making bridges between the two of you. You obviously have difference in gender, you have difference in race, culture, but you are able to build some bridges that obviously Brenda felt very comfortable with. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:24:10
JUDY DANIELS And I think that was an important piece. 

00:24:15
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT In the, the last piece that you were talking about choice, I think that's so important for persons of color, uhm, today because you're not given choice. The counselor makes a decision and you'd either go with it or you just don't come back. 

00:24:25
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  So, I think it's really important. 

00:24:30
MICHAEL D'ANDREA I think it's important to point out that what we're talking about right now are various cultural competencies that, that are not always infused into the training that many graduate students in counseling and psychotherapy are getting. For instance, ah, besides the bridging and to provide an empowerment tool ah, where the client has a choice, where I took time to teach the client about my biases and perspectives about the helping process and then gave her the choice of how we would proceed. Uhm, wa, it was, was one element that's not always taught in our training programs. A big taboo was that I invited ah, Brenda to get to know me as a person and as a professional, and that sort of self-disclosure that went on in that short time that we had together is something that many practitioners are not comfortable doing, and that many counselor, educators, and faculty members in psychology programs are really not training individuals ah, ah, to implement in practice. Again, two competencies that distinguish culturally competent practitioners from more traditionally trained individuals. 

00:25:40
JUDY DANIELS Another thing that I thought you did from the non-traditional perspective was you brought out issues of racism, sexism, so you looked at it from a broader, societal, contextual, environmental perspective. 

00:25:50
MICHAEL D'ANDREA One of the key factors in being culturally competent is that it's important to be aware that these differences exist and that are impacting the helping process. But cultural competence is more than that. It's having a rich and expanded knowledge base about the history, the values of an African-centered way of being and approach to helping. And it really requires an expansive understanding of intentional and unintentional forms of racism that exist. That's part of the multicultural knowledge competency areas uhm, that are, are, are oftentimes not clearly understood by practitioners in the field. Hopefully, in demonstrating that ah, the technique, it will give the viewer a, a chance to think about. Again, one way of, as you said, Judy, ah, building bridges and articulating ah, some of the factors that might create barriers unless they're otherwise addressed. 

00:26:50
BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I think that's one of the other positives of, of this whole movement, you know, not just going straight to the techniques and the skills, but dealing with the knowledge and awareness piece that is really missing. 

00:27:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Now, we're challenged to move on and to ah, demonstrate how this cultural, confident practitioner might be able to demonstrate other forms of awareness, knowledge, and skills as we look at another approach, as we continue on. What we'd like the viewer to keep in mind is that, this introduction would be the opening for all of the three, the following three demonstrations that we will ah, now demonstrate and turn our attentions. So in other words, please keep in mind, ah, as you're viewing this video, that what you just saw would be the opening for the following three sessions, and lets move on. 

00:27:40
Using an Existential-Humanistic Approach to Multicultural Counseling and Therapy 

00:27:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Brenda, thanks a lot for taking the time to get to know me better and for helping us both come to an understanding of how we might proceed in, in, in counseling together and what we hope to achieve. I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about what the specific issue that you've brought here today that we wanna focus in on. 

00:28:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT You know, last week uhm, I was ah, invited to a meeting with uhm, two really ah, esteemed ah, persons in the multicultural movement. Ah, we were going to be working on a project where I was gonna be adding uhm, a black female perspective to it. And we had decided to meet at a restaurant, and I was so excited about meeting this Nick Mearson(ph) that I arrived early, and I was waiting in the ah, holding area. And that one individual did not know me but did know that I was African-American uhm, came in, walked by me a couple of times and kind of ignored me. (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:28:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, and when I realized that that was actually the person I was gonna be meeting because the other vidua, the individual came in, and they the shook hands, and introduced. Uhm, I realize that, you know uhm, this is a, a guru in multicultural... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm, hmm 

00:29:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...uhm, counseling. And he walked by me, knew I was African-American. I was the only one in the area and didn't acknowledge me. So I really felt uhm, devalued. 

00:29:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You felt devalued. Ah, I'm getting something from you as you're telling ah, the story about this situation, devalued is one sense. Can you help me understand some of the other feelings that, that. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Well, it probably has to do even more with the fact that ah, it speaks of the African-American experience... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:29:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...of being invisible. You know, this happens over and over again, that uhm, we're invisible. We don't exist. 

00:29:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I've her, I've heard and I've read about this, they call it the ah, theorists call it the invisibility syndrome were ah, ah, black persons or other persons of color as well, but particularly African-Americans are, are just bypassed on the street, in shopping malls ah, ah, when they're being ah, waiting in line to be served. Ah, ah, ca, can you tell me a little bit more about ah, other ways that you've experienced this directly besides this particular situation? (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, if uhm, in my own uhm, school. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I belong to uhm, the senate and uhm, I can say something and another individual will say something that will be heard. 

00:30:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT They didn't hear what I said... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...and it was the same thing. 

00:30:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, when I was in school uhm, I could raise my hand and have the exact, the answer and my instructors will just, you know, not see me. 

00:30:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA In staff meetings, I noticed that women oftentimes, oftentimes, not occasionally will say things that are not responded to and then a little while later, a male will say something and it, there is a response to what saying. So, you had mentioned earlier in today's session the fact of being a woman and an African-American. Ah, you have really ah, two factors going on here that promote invisibility. Am, am, am I... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:31:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...with you on that? (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yes, like a double whammy, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:31:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I'm a woman, and I'm African-American. 

00:31:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You know, I, I, I feel that I want to connect on an emotional level more with you by empathizing and feeling what you're feeling, and something's happening to me where I'm not getting that connection and has to do with me. Maybe you could help me empathize and get into your feelings better by, could you take a little bit of time to talk about the feelings in this particular situation or any other ones so I can understand how it has affected you? 

00:31:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  You know, Mike, I'm not sure that I can really help you understand... (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...that experience. Uhm, something that you have to go through it yourself. Uhm, the only I can say to you is that, it happens time and time again, and it gets to the point that you'd just don't want to deal with it. 

00:32:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Now, I do see on your face that you're, you're, you're holding your teeth together and you're angry. Are you, you're angry? 

00:32:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, yeah. 

00:32:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You're angry at this one. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, yeah. 

00:32:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And I don't even, you know, it's like I don't even wanna talk about it anymore. It's like uhm, white people know that this exist... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...and then you want me to say it again and again, what I'm experiencing. I don't wanna have to ex, explain it. They should know that they're ignoring me. 

00:32:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm, but are you getting angry with having to explain that with me in this situation here? 

00:32:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I guess I am. 

00:32:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

00:32:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:32:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA How is this going to affect ah, how we move from this point together to look at your feelings or thoughts? 

00:33:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, I just wanna make sure that you hear me and feel what I'm experiencing. I can't put it in words, but I think you can see on my face... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Yes. 

00:33:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  what... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Yeah. 

00:33:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...the experiences I. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I, I get a sense that you feel like I can connect with what you're saying and hear you. 

00:33:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:33:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And that maybe good enough for right now in our relationship? 

00:33:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:33:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. And I also hear you saying loud and clear, I don't wanna talk about this and explain it to you, Michael, you know, here again, to another White person. So maybe we can build on a feeling I was getting from you just a second ago, and that is, that there is a difference between an ideal world that when you think of an ideal world, there's a big difference between the ideal world that you see in your mind and what is happening in the real world. 

00:34:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Absolutely. And the ideal world is, if the multicultural movement is promoting diversity and that we're all have differences, why can we just accept those differences... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA See... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...and move on? (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  the differences and acknowledge them? 

00:34:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yes. 

00:34:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And move on from there... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT That's right. 

00:34:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...together. That's your ideal image in a multicultural society, is respecting each other for the differences, seeing them, affirming them, and moving on. It's not the real world. 

00:34:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT No it isn't, (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:34:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT unpleasantly. 

00:34:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA What choices do you and I have? What choices do we have to deal with the real world? Maybe. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT The only choice I have is to continue being who I am. I'm not going to change being black. 

00:34:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

00:34:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I'm not going to change being a female. So, I'll have to deal with those people who are out there who don't see me and call 'em on it. 

00:34:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You know, we're, we're, we're put on this planet for a little while and we face different challenges and the challenges you're facing are different and ah, seem ah, much more difficult to face than the things I face as a, as a white male. And I really appreciate the opportunity to be trusted with this information and to learn this part about you. Better take a chance here, and I'm gonna see if we can take a few minutes to go beyond the one choice that you see right now, which is that you're gonna just have to choose to be who you are, an African-American woman and be proud of it. I think that's great and I, I really support it. I wonder if we can look at other choices, other choices that you can think about, kind of expand our options? 

00:35:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Sure. What do you have in mind? 

00:35:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You know, I, I don't have any specifics in mind right now so this would be just kinda brainstorming together. 

00:36:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

00:36:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA When I say choices in life, what does that phrase mean to you? 

00:36:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT As an African-American, Mike, I don't really have that choices. I really don't have that many choices, especially because of the color of my skin. That limits my choices. 

00:36:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I'm seeing ah, and feeling the pain and frustration and maybe anger that go along with the idea of limited choices because of your skin color. Am I reading you right? 

00:36:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. I, I, I'm not sure that ah, anger is there about that skin color, but definitely the limitations... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  That's helpful. 

00:36:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...that the skin color places on me. 

00:36:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And more specifically, the anger might be generated from the reactions other people have or don't have to your humanity, to your personhood. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Absolutely. As a person, as an individual who does have some value. 

00:37:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. So, I'm, I think I'm understanding it, and I'm feeling it from you as you talk about it. The second thing I'm thinking about is, how sometimes I might be jumping the gun to almost imply that you have the same choices that I'm afforded and that's really not true. 

00:37:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT All right. 

00:37:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:37:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT All right. 

00:37:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA That was real helpful to stop me in my thinking and ah, thanks a lot. That, that's really helpful. A third point that I'm thinking about is being subjected to racism in different forms and sexism often times leads individuals to ah, underestimate their own personal power and choices. 

00:37:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Underestimating my choices or? 

00:37:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Ah, underestimating a person's choices because after repeatedly being not seen, not valued, not affirmed, I know that some theorists have written about an increase sense of hopelessness and helplessness because of the dominance of racism or sexism. That. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I guess that's uhm, based on my spirituality again, I draw my strength there and I do have hope. Uhm, I don't feel that there is nothing that I can do. 

00:38:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  And you're bringing that hope here today, (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh. 

00:38:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA that counseling might hopefully help you look at the situation in ways that you can do something about it. 

00:38:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Exactly. 

00:38:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I also see you bringing a sense of responsibility, that you feel responsibility to yourself and to black people in general as being a member of that community. 

00:38:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. But not fighting for something that already is, is already mine. 

00:38:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Which is? 

00:39:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT That I am a valuable person and I do have something to offer. 

00:39:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And that's your strength? 

00:39:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yes. 

00:39:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And you want to put that forward wherever you go? 

00:39:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Exactly. 

00:39:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I'm getting a great deal ah, a sense of strong pride, not arrogance, but strong pride, a sense of self-awareness and self-knowledge, in yourself. Those are wonderful strengths that I think we should use to build on as we look at different ways of thinking here in, in the helping process. 

00:39:30
Processing the Humanistic - Existential Counseling Roleplay 

00:39:30
DR. JUDY DANIELS  What we saw in this last vignette was very interesting and different and I'm just wondering, Brenda, from ah, thoughts and feelings perspective, how did you feel in this one? 

00:39:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  In this one, at the beginning, I was uhm, pretty tense because I felt like I needed to confront my counselor. Uhm, but toward the end, because he was showing so much empathy, I felt much more relaxed and trusting. 

00:40:05
DR. JUDY DANIELS Michael, how were you feeling, what were you thinking about in the process as the therapist? 

00:40:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I really did feel that Brenda had ah, given me an invitation by implicitly suggesting there was a difference between the real and the ideal world that ah, she has in her mind, which opened the door for me to test if an existential ah, humanistic approach might be useful in facilitating her development in new ways of thinking. With that in mind, I was deliberately trying to use basic counseling skills that would communicate a sense of unconditional positive regard ah, a sense of positive affirmation. I was really groping hard at trying to develop and communicate genuine empathy ah, and that was a struggle, and I was a struggle as Brenda had indicated, I will never know what it's like to be subjected routinely to the challenges and adverse conditions that she faces on a daily basis. Uhm, I, I, and I did feel something ah, interesting when she indicated that she was tired of explaining it, and then tired of explaining it here in this situation. Ah, I found that that to be a real gift to me, to be that authentic and that confronted, meant that Brenda as an African-American woman, was willing to trust the reaction of a White male therapist and to take a risk that I might come back either negatively or hopefully positively. I guess I'm wondering, how many individuals viewing this sort of style by a Black female, who is assertive, who is confrontive, who challenges the therapist, feel comfortable in continuing to struggle to build a positive relationship. Ah, I would guess and suggest that there are many who are not, who are uncomfortable, who might not feel, who might feel like they would prefer not to work with Brenda. But again, our point here this afternoon is to demonstrate some of the difficult challenges that we'll continue to face. 

00:42:15
DR. JUDY DANIELS Brenda, how did you pick up any discomfort from him? 

00:42:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh yeah. I, I felt very uncomfortable at point uhm, like, oh, I'm being really mean, but then I thought he needed to hear that. 

00:42:25
DR. JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Uhm, one other point he made about uhm, African-American woman ah, being assertive, I hope that people get the idea that an assertive African-American woman is not an aggressive... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...ah, person... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:42:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  uhm, because a lot of times that maybe a turnoff at whereas, it's not that we're trying to be mean and, you know, be bullies or whatever... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...but we're letting you know what we feel. 

00:42:55
DR. JUDY DANIELS I think there's plenty of situations, too, where a client might not necessarily say how they were feeling, might not necessarily challenge the therapist, and yet hold a lot of those feelings and thoughts inside. 

00:43:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:43:10
DR. JUDY DANIELS So I'm also wondering, too, if Brenda hadn't confronted you on some of those things, what might you, how might you (inaudible ). 

00:43:19
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  I might have been approaching it that I was more empathic and more respectful than I was coming across with this client. I thought when I shifted into looking at the existential considerations of choice and responsibility, it was a genuine eye opening experience right here today ah, to remind me as a White male that our choice options are different for a host of structural and environmental reasons, and I really thank you for ah, pointing that out here, but I felt we did a good job together, collaborating with looking at the issue of, of, of hope, of choice, of responsibility, and all of those come out of an existential-humanistic philosophy of ways or conditions that individuals need to have internally that helps stimulate the realization of their potential. 

00:44:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And the other ah, piece of the existential piece of uhm, spirituality, the importance of spirituality to give you that strength, you know, base came out. (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Yes. Yeah. 

00:44:20
DR. JUDY DANIELS And I thought you handled that well, trying build on the strength. 

00:44:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I, I guess we can underscore that we'd looked for ways of identifying, affirming, and building on strengths rather than focusing in on defects that may be mixed-up with our perception of differences. This is hard work, and I'm not always feeling comfortable in this situation but rather than feeling put off or angered or frustrated. What I find myself doing is almost like a voice internally saying to me, you have to work a little bit harder here, listen more carefully, try to get into her shoes, and it is difficult. Even though we're role-playing, it feels pretty real. 

00:45:00
DR. JUDY DANIELS This is a very real situation where you may not always be able to get directly into a client's shoes where you may not have experienced it, and yet you really tried to continue to work at that, that sense of empathy, that sense of rapport and connection, and you did a nice job with it, and without getting too defensive. And I thought that was one of the, the real highlights that came out of this particular. 

00:45:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I think it's easier if therapist or in counselors operate from a belief that, "I can really communicate empathy if we look at and focus in on our similarities," and I agree that's an important part of an existential-humanistic approach. The challenge in cross-cultural situations is can we communicate the highest level of empathy possible by acknowledging, affirming, and bringing to the forefront the differences that are manifested in our life experiences. 

00:45:55
DR. JUDY DANIELS And that was you attempt again to build bridges... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  It was. 

00:46:00
DR. JUDY DANIELS ...and to build, continue to try to build on that, those trust issues. 

00:46:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Yes. 

00:46:00
DR. JUDY DANIELS Well, it'll be fascinating to see the next ah, vignette and see how that develops. 

00:46:05
A Psychodynamic Approach to Multicultural Counseling and Therapy 

00:46:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Brenda, thank you very much for taking the time in the beginning of today's session to help me get clear on some of the thoughts and feelings you have about our differences and ways that I can uhm, help narrow those differences and I look forward to any other suggestions or comments you have about helping us to build bridges here as we continue on with this process. Uhm, I guess what I'm interested now in this is learning more about what brought you here today? 

00:46:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well uhm, I was so excited about going to this uhm, luncheon meeting with a well-known person in the field. So, I arrived at the site that we were supposed to meet a little bit early, and I was just waiting and uhm, this person came by me, and I really wasn't sure what he looked liked, but I knew he knew what I looked like. Well, he knew I was an African-American. And uhm, he walked by me twice and I didn't know who he was so I didn't say anything. And then uhm, later, I noticed that the other person that we were suppose to meet acknowledged him and I thought, "Oh, that's the person I'm supposed to meet." So, I went over, but I was so ticked off because I was like, you know, I'm the only African-American in this place and he didn't come up to say, "Well, are you Brenda?", or, you know, anything. And so, and I just thought, you know, here it goes again. Here I am. I'm a professor. I'm, I'm the only African-American here and yet, this person doesn't get it, invisibility once again. 

00:47:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So, so that, that experience of an, feeling and, and made invisible by someone who should recognize you in this situation really, really caused a lot of feelings inside you. Can you, could you tell me some of, some of those feelings that you had? 

00:48:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah, you know, it's really interesting that you asked that question because the feelings are so mixed. 

00:48:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:48:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT On, on the one point, it's anger. 

00:48:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:48:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  And whether or not I need to repress that anger, you know, because what good is it going to do me. I hear in the back of my mind, you know, when I was growing up, you know, your not going to bring yourself down to other people's levels. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:48:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Okay. 

00:48:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:48:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT So do I deal with the anger or do I, you know, acknowledge the fact that this is this guy's, it's, it's his issue, (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:48:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT it's not mine. 

00:48:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, but and then on the other hand, whether or not I should just uhm, let him know what he has done, deal with the issues so we can move on... (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  So, (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...so, it's mixed. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...so three things you're going on here, (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:48:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ah, ah, an immediate feeling of anger and frustration about the situation occurring once again and feeling that as an African-American female. And then on the other hand, you here a message that says, "I should just let it go, that's his problem, that shouldn't be my problem." And then the third message that I hear you saying is ah, ah, hey, wait a minute, I need to confront this, I ne, I need to point this out to this individual. Those three feelings ah, are, are kinda intermingled in, in, inside yourself and you seem to be struggling with that. I, I wonder if we could take a couple of minutes to talk a little bit about situations or factors in your own personal history, kinda going back in time, that helped you feel this anger or sense of "it's his problem, not mine" or a motivation to confront him. Where, where have these come from? Could you go back in time and. 

00:49:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I think that, you know, African-Americans, particularly, because I am an African-American, uhm, face this all the time. Uhm, we, even though you would think, because the color is there, that you would be seen, but, we're not seen. Uhm, we're not valued. We're not a person. So, I guess it goes back to the old days of, you know, that you're not a person. 

00:50:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So with your family influence in mind, of the three feelings and strategies you have to deal with this frustration, the anger, or the, "Forget it, it's his problem, not mine," or the, "No, I need to confront this individual," in an effective way to point out of what he's doing, can you tell me whose voices in your family are behind those feelings and those strategies? 

00:50:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I think the uhm, first one, would be uhm, the, the anger, would be my family. It would be my... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT mom. It would be my grandmom. It would be my aunt. Uhm. 

00:50:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So your anger is really not just an individual anger? It's a collective, familial anger that's being expressed. That's important. 

00:51:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:51:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And that helps me really... (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right, (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...understand. 

00:51:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT to repress it. 

00:51:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA But you repress it. Tell me the voice that tells you to repress it, to put it down. Tell me about that person, first. 

00:51:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT It, it says don't uhm, come down to their level. Why do you want to come down to their level? 

00:51:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And that's your aunt, you said earlier. 

00:51:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:51:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA That's your aunt, you can hear your aunt's voice saying, "Brenda, don't go down to their level." 

00:51:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:51:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And then the third voice that would say, "Wait a minute, you do need to confront this in a way that." 

00:51:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT That's ah, I think I've learned over the years myself that, you know, just trying to cope and deal with this situation, that I do have a responsibility to confront. I need to let this person know where they are, but I have to do it in a gentle way, if that's possible. 

00:51:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So, it sounds like ah, three voices are coming into play here. One is your, your aunt's voice and your family's voice, saying ah, "This is something to be angry about." But you hear your aunt clearly saying, "Don't, don't go down to their level by getting overly angry and expressing it." 

00:52:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:52:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And then, it sounds like you hear your mother and grandmother saying, "And if you deal with it in your way, never lower your dignity. Hold your chin up high." 

00:52:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Exactly. 

00:52:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA This really gives me a, a better understanding of why you're having the feelings that you're having. And why they're so strong and important to you. And I know that we talked about counseling being mainly focused, on one hand, on feelings going on inside you, but it's also important for you, to talk about things you can do that go outside of you that affect the environment. Where can the rest of today's session be focused in on, knowing about how important these feelings are from your family background and who you are now? Where can we. (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Do, doing something about it, going on making, and making a difference. I mean, you don't just wanna stay there and stew in your own, you know. Uhm, so, find something that you can do that's positive. And I think uhm, that could mean writing about it. It could mean uhm, doing presentations at conferences or, so that the word gets out. But, this needs to be addressed. 

00:53:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So it sounds like what we want to focus in on, for the rest of today's session, is looking at ways that Brenda, in her own unique and individual way, can move beyond the anger, not, not to forget it, but to move beyond it, and look at ways that she can effectively deal with this situation. On that way, I hear you also saying that you're going to heed the advice that your aunt, mother, and grandmother have given you, as we try to find a new and creative way to deal with this situation. 

00:53:55
Processing the Psychodynamic Approach to Multicultural Counseling and Therapy 

00:53:55
DR. JUDY DANIELS  So, Brenda, I noticed that, that roleplay was somewhat different than, ah, existential humanist, or that, that the tone and tenure was a little bit different. And I'm wondering how you were feeling in the roleplay, and what you saw as some of the differences? 

00:54:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I think the main difference was that we had built a relationship, because there's no way, if I did not have a relationship with Mike, and had built some trust that I would've gone into my history, talking about my family and talking about how my family did things. I would have never done that. Uhm, so, I was comfortable, uhm, sharing with him. Uhm, the other thing was I, I was just amazed that my final coping mechanism was a combination of stuff that had happened... 

00:54:50
DR. JUDY DANIELS Hmm. 

00:54:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...in my past. So, that was interesting from, from the, uhm, perspective of, of using this approach that I had never thought of before, that there is some value there. 

00:55:05
DR. JUDY DANIELS So it sort of brought some things together for you? (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
DR. JUDY DANIELS Yeah. And you weren't expecting there to be of much value? 

00:55:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:55:10
DR. JUDY DANIELS And, Michael, what did you see? 

00:55:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Well, I, I guess I saw the relationship-building process being important, but I guess I'm, I, I wanna ask you a question that when you said that, ah, you just wouldn't have gone into a discussion with your family's influence on you. Uhm, the issues that we covered in the very first roleplay talking about our differences and how they might affect each other, is that what you're specifically referring to? 

00:55:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:55:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And if we hadn't gone there and dealt with those early, what do you think you're reaction to some of my questions would have been in this psychodynamic approach? 

00:55:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Probably would not have said a lot. 

00:55:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You would've kept to yourself... (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:55:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...because. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. Because you're right. 

00:55:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And there were, that makes for some barriers, unless we'd discuss it? 

00:56:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Absolutely. Gotta bring that upfront first and deal with it. 

00:56:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And what's really interesting here is that many counselors might interpret your reluctance to talk about family history and it's influence on your life, as being a form of resistance and defensiveness on your part and not consider what I did or didn't do to build a trusting relationship. 

00:56:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:56:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Very interesting. I did see ah, a number of psychodynamic techniques, kind of work for you here. Ah, ah, I was very interested in how you brought up the issue of how you repressed your anger actually use that term, uhm, and then how you got into, what I'll call "sublimating your energies" ah, by working double-time and taking heed of your aunt's response. I guess I'm a little bit interested in ah, a little more interested, in, uhm, why you felt that the exploration of your family, ah, worked for you or kind of made things feel right for you, in this discussion? 

00:57:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Well, it's because, I think because I've never really thought about the influence before. And so, that's why I'm saying about the value of, of this approach that I hadn't thought about the fact that those voices from the past were still there and working, and making me decide how I was gonna cope with this issue. 

00:57:30
DR. JUDY DANIELS The other piece that I sort of see here is it's bringing in your family brought in more of a strength focus, for you 'coz you could draw on the strengths from your historical past in your family, and that seemed to resonate well with you. 

00:57:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  The other factor that came up with the strength-based approach that you're talking about, Judy, was the link between family and spirituality, and how the influence, I think you pointed to your grandmother and your mother, as encouraging you to draw on spiritual strength in order to deal with that invisibility situation. 

00:58:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right, right. Spirituality is very important in, in my family. 

00:58:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I guess that would be a good cue for me to think about ways that I could continue the process, by emphasizing and exploring further spiritual issues with you. 

00:58:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

00:58:20
DR. JUDY DANIELS Well, we're looking forward to doing the next roleplay and seeing what happens. 

00:58:25
A Cognitive Behavioral Approach to Multicultural Counseling and Therapy 

00:58:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Brenda, I'm glad we've taken a little bit of time to get to know each other. And now, I'm very interested in learning more about what brought you here, today. 

00:58:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, last uhm, week I had a meeting scheduled with, uhm, two well-known, uhm, experts in the field of multicultural, uhm, counseling. And one of the persons I had not met before. Ah, the only thing he knew is that he was going to be meeting an African-American female. And we agreed to meet at a restaurant. Well, I was so excited. I arrived at the restaurant early. And, ah, when I arrived, shortly after, an individual came in, ah, which I found out later was that person, but he kept walking by me, but never ever said, acknowledged to or asked me, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...are you Dr. Cartwright? (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And I just felt like I wasn't there. 

00:59:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Like I was invisible. 

00:59:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Uhm. 

00:59:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And from your perspective, it was obvious that you were the only African-American present in the holding area of the restaurant and the he should've, ah, picked up on that. But more so, since he is an expert or viewed as an expert in the field of multicultural counseling. 

00:59:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

00:59:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Ah, to get a better picture of, of what's going on with you, I wonder if we can look at what we call the "ABC's"... (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

00:59:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...of the situation here. And the "A" is the, what we call it, "antecedent conditions" or what, what's going on before, ah, the issue or the problem is, ah, brought to the forefront. Uhm, and I heard you talk a little bit about some of your thoughts and feelings that are antecedent or in the anticipation. 

01:00:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT I was excited. Uhm, I was going to be contributing to some of great work in... (crosstalk) 

01:00:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Uh hmm, Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...multicultural counseling. I was going to meet this wonderful person... (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...who I saw as a, a guru. 

01:00:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

01:00:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And so I was really excited. 

01:00:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  So the thought you had about this individual, as an esteemed scholar in multicultural counseling, made you excited? To had a, his thoughts had an effect on your feelings. 

01:00:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yes. 

01:00:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  And they really propelled you, you were highly motivated. So they had an effect on what you did, your, your own behavior, to be there. 

01:00:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. Which is why I arrived early. Yeah. 

01:00:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Any anticipation of a real positive experience. And then something happened that you described as just passing back and forth? 

01:01:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. And I felt, "Okay, what's going on here?" And I felt, "Oh, I'm being ignored again." I, I feel devalued. I'm not even here. 

01:01:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Did you really shifted as you started talking about that part of the situation, your, your fore, your forehead got tighter, you, you looked down, your tone of voice changed. So, your feelings really changed as a result of recalling in your thinking about that situation of what actually happened. So. 

01:01:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And more, it was, I think that took in more than just me, reflecting on me, but me as a part of the African-American, ah, community. 

01:01:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  I wanted to get back to that, the, ah, and thank you for bringing that up, because it's more than just a situation that made you feel stressed out and tired and, and upset... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

01:02:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ..with being devalued, but it's about you in a much broader context. 

01:02:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Absolutely. 

01:02:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA As an African-American woman, who, ah, may encounter this invisibility, routinely. 

01:02:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Everyday. 

01:02:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Everyday? 

01:02:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Everyday. 

01:02:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  And what sort of reactions do you find yourself having to this daily ah, encounter with invisibility from others? 

01:02:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I just felt my, you know, breath feeling. 

01:02:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I noticed that you... (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  you, you look tighter in your chest... (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And now your face is... (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Ah, what is that feeling? 

01:02:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Tight. 

01:02:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

01:02:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Upset. Angry. 

01:02:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And angry. And how does this affect your personal and professional life? This feeling? Are you able to shake it real quick or do you feel like it carries over and has that. (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, it carries over. 

01:02:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA How so? 

01:02:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Uhm, sometimes, uhm, might, it probably leaves me to feel depressed, to think about it. Uhm, I sometimes, go to sleep. 

01:03:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA As a way of... (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Just not deal with it. 

01:03:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...not to deal with it. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Not to deal with it. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA So, as a way of escaping... (crosstalk) 

01:03:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

01:03:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...a, a very unpleasant situation. 

01:03:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

01:03:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

01:03:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, another way is, uhm, just to displace it and kind of get into, ah, writing, staying up late at night to get articles done. Ah. 

01:03:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA As a way of demonstrating your. 

01:03:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT My capability. 

01:03:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And become visible. 

01:03:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Absolutely. 

01:03:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA To others. 

01:03:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

01:03:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Okay. This is really helpful to get an idea of the ABC's of what's going on in this particular situation. I noticed that as you talked, you, you changed with getting more tense, and, ah, you pointed to your chest as, ah, breathing quicker. Ah, one of the things, I, I want to talk a little bit about our strategy here today. And look at a couple ways that we could kind of move into some action plans and some ways of dealing with this situation. And I remember at the beginning of our session today, you talked about the desire to work both on individual, internal changes, as well as changes in the environment. 

01:04:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Ah, one of the things that I wanna throw out to you and to see how it hits you, is we can spend time in our sessions looking at you learning new skills that might be helpful in this situation, stress management. We oftentimes use some Zen techniques of deep breathing and systematic relaxation of muscles. Ah, to be honest with you, I use these approaches, ah, at work, ah, in various situations. And I find them to be helpful and effective in managing my stresses, you know. That's not to say that it would be a guaranteed effective tool for you, but I wonder how that strikes you. 

01:04:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  Sure, why not? I'll, I'll try it. 

01:04:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay, and, and we can begin to have you go through a very short 10-minute deep breathing and muscle relaxation exercise right here so we can begin the skill-building activity here today. Let me ask the second point, which was even though you were angry and really put off by this individual's way of reacting to you as an invisible person. I understand that you're gonna continue to work with him. 

01:05:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yep. 

01:05:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. And this issue may not just go away, or some of the feelings that you have from the initial encounter may emerge. 

01:05:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT That's true. 

01:05:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  One of the things that I would suggest and see how you feel, it might or might not be helpful. Maybe we could look at ways that you could respond and address this issue effectively and respectfully, in ways that would increase, even an expert's way of thinking, about cross-cultural encounters. You know, you said something I have kept in mind. Early on, in today's session, you said that you believe you have something to offer your work with this individual, as a Black female. 

01:06:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And I really do agree with you. 

01:06:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

01:06:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA One of the things that we might consider doing is role-playing alternative ways of interacting with this individual to see how you might go about dealing with this issue. 

01:06:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Well, you know, I'm tired of it being my problem. 

01:06:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT It is his problem. 

01:06:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

01:06:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  And he is supposed to be the guru in multicultural counseling. So, you know, I don't see that there's a need for me to even change my way of behavior with this issue. (crosstalk) 

01:06:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA What happens if he's not, what happens if he's not aware that it's his issue? And if you can play a role in changing that aspect of your environment and at the same time, helping him become more aware of his impact on other African-Americans. 

01:06:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Oh, I could let him know... (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Okay. 

01:06:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...that it bothered me what he did and pointed out. But probably, I'll just kind of pacify him, you know, be short. But, I'm sure, I could try it. 

01:07:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:07:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT But I, I, I just think from my experiences that, uhm, usually, it's pacification. It's not going to be, uhm, him taking responsibility for what he's doing. It's my dealing with it. 

01:07:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA You know, that may be the case. It may fall on deaf ears, so to speak, if you introduce this idea. But I noticed that you have confronted and challenged me on a number of issues here today. And I'm gonna take a risk of saying from my own perspective, you may be underestimating your impact to have a real strong and positive impact on someone who is considered an expert. And in that way, we might be creating some small environmental change that you indicated the willingness to kind of look at, early on. (crosstalk) 

01:07:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yep. I, I, I would have no problem with, uhm, telling him how I felt. 

01:07:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Then let's spend... (crosstalk) 

01:07:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And we'll see what happened with them. 

01:08:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA How about if we spend the rest of the session today, first of all, going through a relaxation, deep-breathing, muscle desensitization activity for the next 15 minutes? And then shift back, after we've talked about your reactions to that relaxation training to different ways that you could approach this individual, and at the same time, keeping in mind that I could work as your advocate, either by being with you in some of these situations or role playing, how I might be impacted or that other individual might be impacted by what you're saying or doing. 

01:08:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT That sounds like a plan. 

01:08:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Then let's get down to work. 

01:08:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Okay. 

01:08:35
Processing the Cognitive Behavioral Roleplay 

01:08:35
DR. JUDY DANIELS  What we saw on this vignette was a more directive approach. And one of the things that I noticed was that we had, uhm, challenges, both Brenda challenging Michael as the therapist, but then Michael coming back and challenging Brenda as well. And so I just wanted to check in and see how this vignette, you know, felt to you, Brenda, and what your thoughts were. 

01:09:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, when he challenged me, uhm, I guess I was torn because I, I felt like I had to make sure that not all the responsibility was placed on me. And so, that's why I was hesitant to do anything, you know, take any responsibility. 

01:09:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uhm, but as he discussed and, you know, worked with me, then I felt okay. I'm willing to try it, why not? 

01:09:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And it was clear to me that as we were using a cognitive behavioral approach is that Brenda had some definite thoughts about her willingness to engage conversation and confront this individual that had stirred up some real negative feelings. Uhm, and those thoughts were really, ah, aiding her to continue to, ah, experience these negative feelings. And as we discussed it, we saw how these thoughts and feelings were leading to behaviors, depression, uhm, sleeping as a way of escape, that were not necessary, necessarily beneficial in the short or long term to Brenda. 

01:10:15
DR. JUDY DANIELS What do you think, Brenda? Were you comfortable with the process? 

01:10:15
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I think this one required more work. 

01:10:20
DR. JUDY DANIELS Yeah, it seems like it. 

01:10:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT For the client, then we really make a decision, you know? Are you going to put up or shut up. You know, (crosstalk) 

01:10:25
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:10:25
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT you, you can complain, (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:10:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT you can challenge, but now, it's your time to work. 

01:10:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA We seem to have, from my perspective, a, a level of trust that we developed, in the short vignette. 

01:10:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:10:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA And a keeping in mind that the very first vignette was a demonstration of how we began to build a rapport. 

01:10:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA But I was glad that I had indicated early on in the very first vignette, that part of counseling was to affirm and to demonstrate, ah, the value, for each of us. But at the same time, it was gonna be challenging and difficult. So I'm really glad to hear that you said this particular situation took more work. 

01:11:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:11:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I'm also glad, Judy, that you pointed out that this seemed to be less of a comfortable feeling.(crosstalk) 

01:11:10
DR. JUDY DANIELS Hmm. 

01:11:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Ah, demonstration of helping than the preceding one in particular. 

01:11:15
DR. JUDY DANIELS But as a therapist, you seemed to sort of, again, bridge that gap. So, when Brenda was getting a little resistant, a little bit less willing to do, then you were able to bridge it and, and get her re-engaged I thought in a process. (crosstalk) 

01:11:30
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I helped to bridge it by, not only using the "ABC's" as fundamental strategies and the cognitive behavior approach, which you really were able to take and to utilize in a way that helped me get a clearer picture, but also to look at ways that she could leave the counseling session with new ideas about stress management and relaxation training. Ah, that seemed to provide, what I would consider a trust in my expertise, as a helper. (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. 

01:11:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA That gave me the leeway then to push her a bit... (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...and to test the limits, and to look at whether she was gonna accept the responsibility of doing or saying something that may affect her environment, and this individual, in particular, who she's gonna have ongoing contact with. And that was an interesting dance between us. And I felt that, ah, I held my ground and Brenda held her ground. And somehow, as we continued our dialogue, we were able to negotiate a place, ah, going where we both were comfortable working towards. (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:12:30
DR. JUDY DANIELS The other thing that I saw was that you had a bit of a non-traditional approach. You were willing to go advocate for her and... (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:12:35
DR. JUDY DANIELS  you sort of stepped out of a traditional, just let's meet in the office and deal with these issues. (crosstalk) 

01:12:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

01:12:45
DR. JUDY DANIELS And I thought that was, that was an effective strategy. Brenda, what were your reactions? 

01:12:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  I felt good about that. (crosstalk) 

01:12:50
DR. JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT You know, like I had an ally, not just in the office, yeah, which probably made me, uhm, agree to go ahead and try the strategies he suggested. 

01:13:00
DR. JUDY DANIELS Hmm. 

01:13:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Because I was willing to go... (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT To go with. (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...above and beyond the traditional... (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

01:13:05
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...ways of thinking, which requires us to expand the roles that we have traditionally played and advocate as one of those. And, I hope that the viewers would be able to see just one, possible way of introducing advocacy as a role that we are responsible for playing... 

01:13:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

01:13:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...in promoting the mental health and the psychological well-being of all the clients that we work with, but particularly, those individuals who come from groups that have been historically, marginalized, and devalued in our society. 

01:13:35
DR. JUDY DANIELS Well, and from a culturally-competent perspective, advocacy is the key. 

01:13:40
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA From a culturally-competent perspective, we move towards an awareness that only focusing in on intrapsychic issues and working at 50-minute hour in an office-bound situation is not likely to have the sort of impact that we can all have in working more respectfully and ethically in a culturally-diverse society. 

01:14:05
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And I think that's one of the areas, though, that, uhm, many of the training programs across the country are not dealing with the advocacy piece, uhm, which is critical for someone who is from a culturally-diverse background to believe that somebody's there for them. 

01:14:20
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I agree with you. I think training programs for far sure of their responsibility of training students ah, in their roles as advocates. I am very grateful, as I know you two are, the fact that the American Counseling Association has formally endorsed advocacy competencies in their last convention in governing counsel meeting. We're entering a new era. It's a very exciting era that unleashes our potential to tab a much greater impact. Certainly, developing advocacy competencies having faculty members who are dedicated to training students to become advocates for their clients, is one of the new roles that we will be playing as we develop the culture of competencies that we need to continue to work effectively in the future. 

01:15:10
Concluding Thoughts 

01:15:10
DR. JUDY DANIELS  You know, this has been an exci, exciting and fun process, and I've noticed that we've covered a lot of ground in the different roleplay's that we've done. We've covered anything from confrontations and very difficult challenges within the counseling process. We've also covered several different, ah, therapeutic approaches. And I was thinking that, you know, even for the most experienced, multicultural competent counselor, some of these issues would be very difficult to deal with. And then, from a new trainee's perspective, I think some of these different issues that might emerge could be, you know, downright, ah, intimidating, ah, anxiety-provoking, and I think can make the difference in whether a client would, actually, even wanna come back after the initial session in the counseling relationship. And so, I wanted to just focus on you, Brenda, in particular, and get some feedback from you on how you found the whole process and what stakes out for you. 

01:16:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Yeah, I think the thing that stakes out most for me is beyond the techniques, that the person that might present it as, as my counselor, ah, bringing the experiences evidently from working with persons from ah, culturally different background. He was not focusing on, uhm, paraphrasing what I said or reflecting my feelings. He dealt with my feelings and really got in there, stayed with the issue. And ah, I think that made the difference... (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...for my reacting to him. And I'm not sure that counselors who were out there, who were white, would even take the chance to do what Mike did. And, you know, you have to be able to bring yourself, and with, with some, some kind of sensitivity to what the client maybe feeling. And, and that made all the difference in the world, my feeling comfortable to go ahead and share. 

01:17:20
DR. JUDY DANIELS I noticed that he sort of rolled with the punches... (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
DR. JUDY DANIELS ...when you would challenge him with different points, he was able to, even though it was apparent at different points that he might not be that comfortable, he was able to, sort of right, come right back... (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
DR. JUDY DANIELS ...and be his own person in how he responded. And, I think, that's part of what you're talking about. (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Exactly. 

01:17:35
DR. JUDY DANIELS And then, I think, his responding, ah, like in the psychodynamic, looking at the familial... (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh-huh. 

01:17:45
DR. JUDY DANIELS ...history and background and bringing in some of those things. I think that was an important tie for you in terms... (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
DR. JUDY DANIELS ...of the relationship-building and being able to look at things from a different perspective. 

01:17:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Right. 

01:17:55
DR. JUDY DANIELS Yeah. Michael, what, what are your impressions? 

01:17:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Well, well, I know that the, the rapport-building, the relationship-building, the trust-building part of counseling and psychotherapy was very important. I'm kinda stuck on something the two of you said, which was, to the experienced counselor, this would be difficult challenges. To the student, it would be intimidating. Most white practitioners may not deal with these issues. The reason for all that is that, it makes one feel vulnerable. And in this professional video in developing it, I felt vulnerable on numerous occasions. I guess, what I also felt was something in front of that vulnerability, which was a real desire to get to know who Brenda was, as Brenda, trying to really make substance out of that term, empathy. Trying to really get under your skin to know what your life experiences was like. But I'd be less than honest to say, it was enjoined with some sense of vulnerability. Maybe it was my desire to learn from the client that I was rolling with the punches, as you said, Judy. 

01:19:05
DR. JUDY DANIELS Well, and I think that's an important attitude and value to bring in to the process, that it is a learning process. And, even though it may get uncomfortable, it's how you gonna respond in those situations. And the, and the client is constantly reading how you're responding. 

01:19:15
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA I wonder if there was anything that you could offer me and to the viewers and the approaches that we used here today, that would have you even been more helpful. Any reactions that you can think of that, again, would help me or the viewers? 

01:19:30
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT  As you said, step into, try to step into my shoes. 

01:19:35
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT And feel what I am feeling, rather than, uhm, doing the rote, uhm, techniques that... (crosstalk) 

01:19:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT ...that we learned in the textbooks. 

01:19:45
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  And when we make mistakes in a multicultural situation, to acknowledge those, (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. 

01:19:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA and to get some assistance from the client, is helpful? (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Hmm. Sure. 

01:19:55
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA  I really appreciate the time that we've spent together, and this has been a real learning experience for me. And I wanna thank both of you for the time and for the help that you've given me and, hopefully, the viewers. 

01:20:10
DR. BRENDA CARTWRIGHT Okay. 

01:20:10
DR. JUDY DANIELS That's fun process. Thanks. 

01:20:10
DR. MICHAEL D'ANDREA Thanks a lot.
