Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:00
WINNIE KING , M.D. Hi I'm Dr. Winnie King in the lobby of the children's hospital at Montefiore in New York City. If your spouse is an alcoholic, chances are that your family life is chaotic and that is having a tremendous effect on the kids. You probably try to do something about it. May be you've been covering up, cajoling or even threatening in order to get the drinking to stop. You probably also finding that none of these tactics had actually worked. Well, the hard truth is as with any addiction, the only person who can get the alcoholic to stop drinking is the alcoholic. But whether or not, you can accept that. There are things you can do to help your kids. 

00:01:40
WINNIE KING Here is an extraordinary look at one family struggle to survive a parents’ alcohol addiction. For Marlin Farley that struggle begun when he was a small child living with alcohol-addicted parents. 

00:01:55
MARLIN FARLEY Father of Six Even at five years old, I remember umm... alcohol and drugs affecting my life in a... in a probably in small major way. When I was in the 6th grade, I was basically umm... raising ah... three brothers and a sister on my own as my parents were not able to... to maintain umm... a household. It was getting to the point where I was just not able to cope very well on my own. Social Services came into our home and my family was then umm... basically split up. Both parents were sent to treatment facilities and myself and my brothers and sister were... were placed into foster care services. I've always wanted just to be able to give back from that one act of kindness from that social worker you know, who brought some sanity back into... into my life and so ah... when I was in the 7th grade, I'd... I made that decision that I wanted to become a social worker and I told myself that I would never drink and there is no way in act(ph)that I would ever put my family through what I, what I went through as a child. But when I was 15 years old and when I took that drink, I can remember saying to myself "Oh...O... Marlin you're in trouble", because of that first drink that alcohol may be feel good and I continued to use alcohol through... throughout high school, throughout college and... and into my adulthood. 

00:03:30

00:03:35
MARY FARLEY Marlin's Wife He seem to be a happy person at the very beginning, you know and I thought you know I've found the perfect person to be with. Our family life was very happy. My oldest is David, he is 27 and he lives in New Mexico and there is Jenelle, then Dillon(ph), Waylon(ph) Marlin, and Natasha is 12. We're used to doing things together. 

00:04:00
JENELLE MOONEY Marlin's Daughter Marlin is my step-dad. We used to go to the movies ah... He take us on walks, you know and tells about the different trees or you know and about history to (inaudible ) history. 

00:04:12
MARY FARLEY We did a lot of umm... things umm... with Marlin's work with the group home kids. 

00:04:15
MARLIN FARLEY It was a time when ah... because of my profession, because of the work that I was in and because of my role within the community that I was hiding and concealing how much I was drinking. However, inside it was never fulfilled. I was never complete and I... I truly was never happy. 

00:04:35
MARY FARLEY When I started noticing changes was umm... after I had had Natasha. He would take me out to different places and socialize with people, but I noticed that there was more and more drinking. The focus was drinking. It wasn't really on our own family. 

00:04:50
JENELLE MOONEY Often he was drinking and things, don't know why he is in nights... by the end of the nights, so he was sometimes he would umm... drive drunk with us in the vehicle and it was pretty scary at times because very young, so I just really felt like there was nothing we could do, but hold on ha..ha... 

00:05:10
MARY FARLEY I started noticing that he was umm... staying out, not coming home from work right away, missing dinner. He was missing the kids' bedtime stuff and you know, our whole routine was kinda of changing. 

00:05:25
MARLIN FARLEY And then of course, I found myself umm... creating chaos, creating conflicts, starting arguments, so that I would have an excuse to... to get out and when I would get out I would drink and I would gamble and, and then there would be times that I... I wouldn't find myself coming back home for two or three days at a time. 

00:05:45
JENELLE MOONEY I didn't understand why he was leaving. I didn't understand you know, I thought it was some, you know something more like he wasn't happy here with us or you know... and so that hurt my feelings. I don't exactly remember the transition from it being bad to extremely bad, but because it seem like it happened just like that quick. 

00:06:10
MARLIN FARLEY You know my alcoholism started to progress. I experienced a number of losses in my life, then I was using alcohol as a crush(ph) to get through that... that... those depressive times and, and those very difficult times and my life my begun to spite(ph) a lot of control. 

00:06:30
JENELLE MOONEY My kids, you know, they had so many questions, "Where is dad? How come he is not here? How come he is so crappy? How come he is this and that?" and you know, I did my best to try to umm...give answers that weren't umm.. alarm them I guess. But they have eyes and they've ears. I would say "There was kind of like abandonment and you know, there was times when we needed him when he wasn't exactly there and he has missed like sports events or stuff like that. You know, when especially when it's like parents and I and you know your parents not there. 

00:07:05
MARY FARLEY He was missing work. Umm... they were calling here for him. I would come up with an excuse, because I didn't want him to get fired, not realizing that I was doing more harm than good. I was trying to keep things as normal. Ha... ha... so that fun as normal as possible in my mind. Life is hard and umm....marriage is a sacred thing and so, I really took that to heart. 

00:07:35
MARLIN FARLEY Sometimes I could be very loving caring, and then when sometimes I just couldn't even be within my own skin and I couldn't tolerate a whole lot and... and so that I know that, that there was yelling and... and... there was times of umm.... just... just violence and umm... and I know that I... I sacred my kids I know, umm... that I hurt my kids very deeply. 

00:08:00
JENELLE MOONEY When my dad was heavy into his drinking, his temper would flare and he wasn't, he was verbally abusive especially to my mom and you know, it would be like, you know may be you need to... we were do something you know, because we didn't want our mom get hurt or anything like that and umm... it was really upsetting and hard, because you now, umm... we were still younger, but to see our mom upset like that and there is not really anything we could do about it to make her feel better. 

00:08:35
MARY FARLEY Oh, there was options, but just whether I wanted to take those options with something that I... I struggled with and I eventually talk to myself out of getting the help, because ah... self-pride. You know, community talk, which was probably out there anyway already, but I had many plans, you know talking to him about his drinking and may be that would wake him up or umm.. finding some place to go together and, and... really getting down to what was happening. None of those plans work. I became very lonely and frustrated and hurt and angry, all those feelings you know and I had to suppress them, because I probably become a person I didn't want to be. I finally came to the point of giving him an ultimatum. You know, I... I couldn't live like that anymore and I couldn't have my kids living that life either. Marlin left and was gone for almost I think two years. 

00:09:40
JENELLE MOONEY When he left, then my mom ended up having to get two jobs to keep us all you know... everything paid and went on. 

00:09:50
MARY FARLEY They didn't get home from my second job until 11 - 11:30 and so it was very hard, and then I've to connect with them, which most of the time they be in bed. 

00:10:00
JENELLE MOONEY I was the oldest one and I had just stay home and learn how to cook and ha... all those kinds of things laundry and taking care of my little brothers and sisters, because they were still really young. 

00:10:10
MARY FARLEY Everyday, I made it a point to let her know. Everyday how much I appreciated what she did, you know and so that's how we kinda got along. 

00:10:25
MARLIN FARLEY That there was times I... I would enter into a bar, I would enter into the casino and with all my heart and with all of the will power that I had I would tell myself that you gonna go in there and you can have one drink and I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't leave it. One drink would lead to two, two drinks would lead to three, three drinks would lead umm... leave me bewildered and it would leave me powerless. It would leave me without any hope I think that I would ever leave that place. 

00:10:55
MARY FARLEY I was just lost and my thing was prayer every day, you know and I just didn't want to give that up, because I would've given up, I would've lost it and, and if I did that, we won't have a family. 

00:11:15
WINNIE KING What a story, but that's not the end of it. The question is what can a family do. The answer is no situation is hopeless even if the drinking continues. We'll see that there are something that sobered spouse can do to help the children and themselves. 

00:11:30
WINNIE KING Pat O’Gorman is an expert on alcohol addiction. She spoke with our producer, Karin Attonito about why alcoholism is considered a disease and what steps you can take to help protect your kids from its effects. 

00:11:45
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO Tell your kids: Parents are sick Alcoholism is a disease It's the parent's problem It's not the child's fault 

00:11:45
PATRICIA O'GORMAN , PhD Psychologist What we mean that addiction is a disease is that there really is a biochemical predisposition in the brain umm...just like other chronic diseases for this to occur and like other chronic diseases, that you need to kinda activate it in a way and somebody with predisposition activates alcoholism for example by drinking and drinking a lot, and then you've addiction going on. We need to do is let kids know that parents love them, but parents have a problem or parents are sick in age appropriate language. For example, you may say to a younger child that you know that mummy has an allergy and every time she, you know she takes alcohol, makes her sick, and mummy loves you. It's just when she sick, she can show it. Ah...for an older child, do you may say, you know talk about genetics and that you know, there is a genetic problem here so that we help kids understand that the parent has a problem. It's not that they have the problem. It's actually normal for kids to think the things with their fault. It developmentally appropriate for kids to feel there in the center of their own universe. Here so, adults need to come in and help kids really figure things out. 

00:12:50
The child can't control or cure the alcoholism 

00:12:55
WINNIE KING It's also important to explain that the child can't control or cure the alcoholism either. 

00:13:00
PATRICIA O'GORMAN Because what kids will try to do is change themselves in work and become preps(ph) with children as they try to change themselves to make the parent act differently. 

00:13:05
WINNIE KING But while the children can't improve things by changing their behavior, there are things that the non-drinking spouse can to do help. 

00:13:15
Create predictability and structure Set limits on the addict Don't make it too easy "Covering up" makes it worse Don't deny your child's feelings Validate the child's reality Denial makes kids feel unsafe 

00:13:15
PATRICIA O'GORMAN Well you, the family needs to do is to really develop a structure A structure that is not held hostage if you will by the... by the addict's behavior. A structure that continues umm... that's what protected for children having predictability and a structure. It's really important to begin to set limits on the addict and set limits for how much you're gonna allow him to intrude in the sense of what's happening within the family. So, you set a dinner time and let say it's 7 o'clock and you don't wait till 10:30 when the addict shows up to have dinner. I think sometimes what's... you know what get scene as the spouse contributing to the problem is the spouse not addressing the problem. The spouse going along to get along. Making it too easy to use. Excuses get made(ph), things get covered up and... and the children in the family pickup that you know that there is all this dancing around that happens and so, they begun to start feeling unsafe. They begun to feel they have to keep secrets. Umm... people are purposely trying to do this. They're trying to keep the family together often at any cost, but by not allowing somebody to fall on their face you kinda keep them propped up in a way that only makes them... allows them to get sicker. Frequently, people had this tendency to deny the child's feelings as if that's gonna make them all go away, but validating the child's reality is very important. Parents have this tendency to say everything is okay like better raises memory blanks. No, but does it, it just makes kids feel really unsafe. And when a child feels they are alone, when they feel they, they are responsible for their parents that's a tremendous responsibility that kids will act out around at some point if we don't help them with it. 

00:15:00
WINNIE KING The behavior that often happens in that situation is called parentification. 

00:15:05
Don't put kids in parental roles Let kids be kids Reach out for help -- you're not alone! 

00:15:05
MARLIN FARLEY What happens is that children in a situation, where they see the adults not doing what needs to be done, children will take over those roles. When we put kids in parental roles, it means other things developmentally are not happening and that is a major problem. It's very important to let our kids be kids and not to make them into little miniature adults. It's also very important umm... for the non using spouse to reach out for help umm... and do not feel they are in this alone, because they're not. It's about reaching out others allowing others to reach out to you not being alone... alone we can't solve it. (inaudible ) does help the non-drinking, non-using spouse help themselves so that they can help them protect their children and that's a very important role of above and on. It also means that you know they've somebody that they can go to who has lift it, who has practical tips somewhat to do. It's a very helpful thing. Also, it's really important for children to know that they're loved especially living in this kind of upheaval. So, what you do, you tell your kids you love them. ha...ha... You don't have to resume(ph) that and you also tell them that the parent who is ill loves them. Even though that parent has a problem, you can't always show it that it's in that parent's heart. 

00:16:30
WINNIE KING And what if the drinking stops, well the truth is everything doesn't just go back to normal. Let's find out what happened to the Farley's. 

00:16:40
MARLIN FARLEY I think after umm... all those years of drinking, and then that... that downward spiral that I talked about and especially in that last year, umm... it pretty much all came to end September 11 and I was in a hotel room. Somewhere in Nebraska and not feeling well at all, watching the Twin Towers come down and it was first time I think that I didn't feel fear for myself umm... and I wasn't thinking about just Marlin and that I became fearful for, for my family, for my wife, for my kids, and... and for.. for just for people in general and got down into my hands and knees and ask creator to just to remove this.. this obsession to drink and that... I... I didn't wanted do that anymore, I don't want to gamble anymore and I just wanted to come home and... and take care of my family, and, and take care of my people. 

00:17:40
MARY FARLEY When 9/11 occurred, he called and said that he was coming home and the look on my kid's faces was you know... it was like I'd just given them the worse news possible. 

00:17:55
MARLIN FARLEY I was in treatment for 90 days and umm... and I can honestly say that you know for those 90 days, I cried. That was how much hurt, pain guilt, shame, fear, you know all those things that were just all wound up into one. You know, I was able to allow myself to... umm... to begin to heal. 

00:18:20
MARY FARLEY I was still not sure if I wanted to have him move right back after he got out. I was... I wasn't sure. Umm... I was still thinking and I'm getting back the same person that left. I could already see a resistance in my two oldest is that you know what, he is not gonna walk and he had (inaudible ) take over, because it's not gonna be that way. 

00:18:41
Voice of Patricia O'Gorman, PhD 

00:18:41
PATRICIA O'GORMAN In early recovery, there needs to be a lot of support for the children and there is a tendency for everyone to think everything is okay and it's not. This whole family now needs a kinda reorganized. 

00:18:55
JENELLE MOONEY When he came back, I was really still angry at him, with him with the whole situation and I didn't understand how, you know everybody could be so forgiving right away and I thought like he had done something really wrong and I didn't think it was that easily forgivable. 

00:19:10
PATRICIA O'GORMAN It's very complicated and very stressful, because if this kid was the confident child who was running the family. Well, umm... this kid now may be out of a job and the power struggles are gonna be enormous. That's when they make it more depressed. 

00:19:25
JENELLE MOONEY It was very hard to like let go over what had happened, because that was I feel like it changed my life so much and that you know, I've to become almost like a parent to... for them when I was hard to like go about and trust that somebody else could take care of I mean that they would be okay. 

00:19:45
JENELLE MOONEY You got the pan from the spash(ph). 

00:19:50
MARY FARLEY Yeah, I'm gonna get the corn going first. 

00:19:50
MARLIN FARLEY You know, it's about making a man's and I was able to make a man's to community members to law enforcement agencies to old bosses and probably the most difficult part for a person and recovery coming back home is to make those immense to your family. It's very-very difficult, because umm... you see the pain, you see the trauma and I knew the trauma that I cause that my objections caused. Actually, umm... I was very fortunate to have umm... people in the chemical dependency feel that... that came to our home and worked umm... with our children. The kids were able to hear and understand that... that my drinking and my gambling, my absence from home, my anger, guilt, shame, and fear was not about them. They were also able to hear that from their dad, because I had a understanding that as a... as an adult umm... child I'm alcoholic, I was able to umm... being empathetic to my children. 

00:20:50
JENELLE MOONEY You know, we're taking the baby steps. Since he has been in recovery, he has been, I can see a lot more patience in him with the rest of the family, umm... like the lines of communication are open and help you know. We all spent a lot more time together. It's more fun to be together yet than it was before when everybody was stressed. 

00:21:10
MARLIN FARLEY And I've been in recovery for nearly five years and umm... and I know that "Yeah, today that I still have a long ways to go on my recovery." Come on Marlin(ph) sit down and eat. 

00:21:25
MARY FARLEY I attended several support meetings and just listen the first time that I was there and ah... was surprised that I... you know, a lot of people were in my situation and umm... there were so willing to just talk about it so openly and here it was just tight lipped and nervous, but that's the way I went for a quiet a few visits there, until I felt I had to just share certain memory that came to mind and that's when I became up an active part of the group. 

00:22:00
MARY FARLEY I see a change in her like, she is also more patient you know. She has helped given me a different perspective from what I thought originally about my dad and his drinking and you know. 

00:22:15
MARY FARLEY I learned to just take one day at a time, just one day, one hour even and it eventually I... I noticed umm... I was seeing things and relating to people a lot differently, having more patience listening, ah... talking to my kids very openly and honest about things that I probably wouldn't have done before. Just how it's effective them, it's okay to feel that way about things that you're you know, you think your dad might have done and it's okay to let him know, but in a good way. 

00:22:50
PATRICIA O'GORMAN Child Welfare Specialist Stepping out of the role should be playing and stepping into new roles that make you feel better that are helpful is what recovery is all about. Umm... and it's a process, you know you just don't start it and there it is, it's all kinda of finished one day. But it's umm... stepping in two things that are helpful, that are nurturing, that are better for your children. These are steps every parent can take. 

00:23:10
JENELLE MOONEY I think the bad part of it is that like I did missed that part of going up for being a kid, but I also think that umm... my family ties became a lot stronger and I guess the whole situation has taught me a lot of patience and understanding and forgiveness, forgiveness definitely. 

00:23:30
MARLIN FARLEY One of the most important things that has happened to our family is that umm... it has brought us back to... to our traditional blues, to our customs, to our culture, to our language. They... we enter(ph) into our ceremonies and umm... we go to... to our social gatherings that powers as a family together umm... we... we pray together as a family and all these things that are... are very much... ah... very important part. Now, to my recovery... recovery, but to our family's recovery. 

00:24:05
WINNIE KING If you could go back in time and... and give yourself a little bit up and wisdom that you've learned today what would that be. 

00:24:15
MARY FARLEY I guess I would tell myself that you're not alone and everything that you think you're doing right, you're not. I'm sorry. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:55
MARY FARLEY Umm... I'm not be afraid to reach out to accept umm... helped from somebody to say I don't know what to do and I need some direction. I need some help. Umm... please help me. They say don't talk to strangers, but if you go to the right stranger, you know, they... they have more to offer. They have a... a bigger set of ears I think, you know and they're more willing to listen and to give you hope. You know because a lot of us lose hope you know. If you're just willing to just take that first step, it's very frightening, it is, but you'll be more than happy that you did.
