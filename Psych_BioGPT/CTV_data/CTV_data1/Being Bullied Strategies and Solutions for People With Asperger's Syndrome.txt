Being Bullied 

00:00:00
Strategies & Solutions for Children With Asperger's 

00:00:00
All of the people who appear in this program have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. 

00:00:00
NICK DUBIN I'm Nick Dubin, I was diagnosed, uh, on the spectrum with Asperger's Syndrome about a year and a half ago. And, uhm, since then, I've been giving speeches, presentations and, uhm, trying to inform the community a little bit more about Asperger's as well as speaking about some bu, bullying related topics, related to Asperger's. 

00:00:45
Maxwell age 9 

00:00:45
MAXWELL Well I think that bullying should be prevented so other victims don't feel, fell pain or ter, or feel terrible about themselves. 

00:00:55
[music] 

00:00:55
NICK DUBIN And the reason bullying is important to me is because it affected me just like it affects so many other people on the spectrum and I feel like if I can do something to help, um, curb that kinda behavior that I will have done my part. 

00:01:10
Robert age 34 

00:01:10
ROBERT Once the kids know that they can get away with it, and once they know that the adults aren't going to do anything, for fifteen minutes or half an hour every day it's just open season. Um, I used to try like, not to eat my lunch on purpose so I couldn't go out. Teachers got ahold of that, you know, they, they, they catch up eventually to ya. And then they start kickin ya outside no matter what. You know. And then you're really dead cause you're out there for the last five, ten minutes and the kids are just wound up and hey hey, here comes out favorite target. 

00:01:50
NICK DUBIN Currently I'm, I'm a student at the Center for Humanistic Studies which is a doctoral program in Psychology. 

00:02:00
Andrew age 15 

00:02:00
ANDREW Most of the times I was bullied were not, no one ever beat me up, but people used to verbally abuse me and they would, um, humiliate me and I re, they tried to push my buttons and it worked. 

00:02:15
NICK DUBIN It's empowering to give lectures to people on this subject because, um, growing up I had nobody to listen to me when I was being bullied. I had no one who could come to my aid and now to be able to be in a position to help others, um, advocate for themselves as well as the bystanders in the area who can kinda come to the aid of the victim. If I can help create that, then it would feel very very empowering to me. 

00:02:40
Presentation at Judson Center Royal Oak, Michigan 

00:02:40
NICK DUBIN I'm very honored to be here today to, um, speak to you as a, uh, as an Aspie and also, about a topic that's very important to me. Um, primarily because, well, I consider myself an expert on two things. I'm an expert on having Asperger's and I'm an expert on having been bullied. So, those two things, combined with my Master's degree in special education, hopefully will make for a pretty informative presentation on, uh, things that we can do as a community to help curtail, um, the really destructive problem that we have of bullying. 

00:03:15
The Problem of Bullying 

00:03:15
NICK DUBIN So now, I'd like to talk about what I, wa, came here to talk about today and that's bullying and the effects it has on our population. Um, bullying is really a serious, serious problem in our schools. It's really an epidemic. It's worse, the research says it is worse today than it's ever been before. And this is observable with Columbine, with school violence. Now, I, I bet you didn't know that 160,000 children miss school on a daily basis because they're afraid of being bullied. These're the kids who pretend to be sick. And 160,000 of em is the population of a pretty big city, so I'd like to lower that number. Uh, children who have, or children have a 75 percent chance of being bullied throughout their k through 12 years. Now we're talking about all kids, not just ASD kids. Um, in 1993 27 percent of middle school students worldwide reported be bullied often. 

00:04:15
Andrew age 15 

00:04:15
ANDREW And they used to call me all these terms and stuff, like retard and, um, all these other things. Midget cause I used to be really short and then it really got me mad and I reacted and the, and the people who, the adults there didn't really do much in those cases. 

00:04:35
NICK DUBIN I was bullied a lot, and not only from other students, but teachers. You know teachers can bully. Who's to say that it's only students in a school who can bully? Teachers can bully. One incident was, um, when I was in the second grade, uh, one of my teachers, I was in an LRC class room, and one of my teachers sent me down to a second grade classroom because one of the students forgot to come. So I walked down with this other girl and I knock on the door and she says, uh, ?Come in.? So I tried turning the handle it wouldn't open for some reason. I didn't know why. And this teacher humiliated me. She said, ?You mean you're eight years old and you can't even open a door, what's wrong with you?? And all the while, while I'm out there, I hear all these kids laughing. So, this whole thing took, probably took ten minutes to take place. And really what that, what that shows is, if the teacher can bully and if the teacher can make other students laugh at you, then that kinda condones bullying doesn't it? I mean if the teacher can observably bully a child, kids can pick up on that real easily. And they, they can think to themselves, ?You know what, this is acceptable.? 

00:05:45
Robert age 34 

00:05:45
ROBERT It got to the point where, there were three guys. And I don't even remember their names anymore, I think it was Jeff, Kevin and whatever, you know, whatever, but they were like the bigger guys, they, they looked bigger than everybody else. They were more mouthier in class, they were the ones who were always getting sent to the principal's office and all of a sudden one day, and I don't know why, probably something I wasn't doing, but they started coming up to me and, ?Hey.? You know and start pushing me around or, they'd come up and, like I sai, I keep saying this, but their favorite tactic was to come up and, if I was wearing a hat, was to actually run up, grab the hat off my head and I would just stand there terrified. Because, I didn't know what to do and they would take off, ?Robert's wearing a hat, Robert's wearing a hat.? And they'd start running around the school yard, they'd throw it, um, one day they threw it in a puddle of water. And picked it up and threw it back to me. And I remember just looking at them like, ?Why would you do that?? 

00:07:10
NICK DUBIN Teachers contribute to the problems of bullying by, number one, being apathetic, and number two, by actually blaming the victim. 

00:07:20
ROBERT The other one they used to like to do is take my pencil box, and they'd take it away from and they'd open it up and they'd dump it down the hallway. You know. So then I'd be out in the hallway trying to pick up my pencils and the teachers'd be like, ?Oh, you're late for class.? ?Well, yeah I'm late for class, cause?? ?I don't wanna hear it.? Teacher's never wanted to hear anything about anybody else. 

00:07:45
Andrew age 15 

00:07:45
ANDREW Well usually when I got to the adults, I was usually real angry so I was shouting. They couldn't get much information out of me, and then I'd usually get in trouble for, ge, for, for shouting at the teacher. 

00:08:00
NICK DUBIN We've interviewed people who have said that teachers have gotten mad at them because they came forward, maybe in a state of rage, but they, they were upset. And what the teacher didn't understand was, you have an ASD child who's just been bullied, of course he's going to be upset. Maybe he needs some cool-down time. Why punish that kid, though, for coming forward in a state of rage when that's just how they feel, that's how they process things. So teachers should learn more about ASD, learn how they react to bullying. And also, don't blame the victim. 

00:08:30
ANDREW I think they should've waited until I was calm, and then get the real story out of me. 

00:08:35
Robert age 34 

00:08:40
ROBERT And the one I really hate is stop being a tattle tell. That one right there is the one thing I, I just, I hope that one gets through. It is, you know we're on the spectrum and stuff and we don't know what we're doing. So, when we finally get the courage to ask an adult, ?Hey, you know, somebody's picking on me. Somebody's doing something it's really making me mad.? And they say, ?You're being a tattle tell. We're not going to do anything.? Okay, now you just got shot down by the supposed adult. You know, the one person that's supposed to be there. That, you know, they always say, ?Hey, you got any problem, go to the lunch mother, go to the principal, go to your teacher.? That's not the way it works. They don't wanna hear it. 

00:09:30
NICK DUBIN People call bullying peer abuse and I think that's a more accurate name for bullying. It's really peer abuse. That's not a rite of passage or anything that anyone should go through, like t, like some people say. ?Well, you know, it toughens, it toughens him up or it's a rite of passage.? No it isn't. Nobody should have to go through it. So, growing up, obviously my self-esteem was really, really negatively affected. Um, I always felt like an odd duck. I always felt different from everyone else because everyone was always picking on me. 

00:10:00
Robert age 34 

00:10:00
ROBERT I used to come back from lunch, I think in second grade, I might have went home, maybe 20, 30 days, because after lunch my stomach would be hurting so much. 

00:10:15
Maxwell age 9 

00:10:15
MAXWELL Once when I was younger, a bunch of, I was, um, sitting, I was on the swings at school and then a few, and then a fourth graders, some fourth grade girls started twisting me around on the swing. Like, started so I was like, um, trying to go like go around started spinning and I got dizzy. 

00:10:35
ROBERT I just, I couldn't go through class for the rest of the day. As soon as they know you're not coming back, you're just more of a target the next day. 

00:10:45
MAXWELL When I, and I been bullied another time, but I don't wanna go in details and that made me feel angry. Very, very angry. But heat was running up inside me and it was like there was a dragon inside me, making it all fiery and, and it made me mad and like that. That's how I feel. 

00:11:05
Andrew age 15 

00:11:05
ANDREW I sometimes have flashbacks of how angry I got. I just randomly cuss, swear. And I got angry and I did stupid things. 

00:11:20
ROBERT And, you know, kinda silly. I'm older now, and nobody's going to run up and steal my hat, or knock my book bag out of my hand or anything or steal my lunch, but that, that's always there. A feeling of, ?Okay, I'm around a bunch of people and somebody's out to get me.? 

00:11:40

00:11:40
Easy Targets: Children on the Autism Spectrum 

00:11:45
NICK DUBIN So I'd like to talk about some statistics regarding children who, um, have ASD and bullies. Um, there have been a number of studies on this. One study revealed that 22 out of 22 children with ASD, ages 11 to 19 reported that their children were being victimized. When I'm saying victimized, I'm not just talking about teasing. I'm talking about serious victimization. Now, if 22 out of 22 children, if that's reported, then we have a real problem with our population and bullying. The average victimization was 1.25 times a week. That could be being locked in a locker, being beat up. I mean, once a week to have to deal with that, can you imagine. It's horrible. 23 percent of the parents in that same study reported two times, two or more times victimization per week. Another study found 400 parents with ASD, ages ranging from four to 17, 94 percent of those children had been bullied or victimized. And I tend to think it might even be higher than 94 percent. And, um, not surprisingly, children with ASD are four times more likely, than their peers to be bullied at school. Obviously the same victims always tend to be targeted over and over. The bully wants to look for the vulnerable person, the person who's not going to be able to fight back. 

00:13:05

00:13:05
NICK DUBIN 

00:13:05
Nick at age 14 

00:13:05
NICK DUBIN I wanna have a discussion about self-esteem, cause I'm having trouble with it, you know. Like, being with, being around friends and stuff, and calling people you know. It's just, it's just like whenever I like pick up the phone to dial, it's like, in my mind I'm thinking, what, I know this an old thing. What if they don't wanna pu, why is Nick Dubin calling me? I don't want Nick Dubin to call me. I just, that's what I get nervous about. 

00:16:30
Solution. 1. Empowering Bystanders 

00:16:30
NICK DUBIN A lot of teachers b, honestly believe that the way to solve the bullying problem is to take the bully aside, say 30 slaps with a wet noodle and give the kid a detention or a suspension even. Most people are tackling bullying from the stand point of, ?Hey, we gotta punish this kid. We gotta institute a zero tolerance policy. If they do this, he's outa there.? That's not really tackling the root cause of what's going on. The root cause is, the bully is bullying because they want to elevate their social status. How do we take away that incentive? So bystander apathy is when a student witnesses another student being bullied and does either nothing to stop it, contributes to it by offering encouragement, jeers and cheers, and gives non-verbal signs of approval such as smiling and clapping. And, um, I like this point. Bystander apathy teaches students to passively accept injustice. 

00:17:45
Andrew age 15 

00:17:45
ANDREW I think that, uh, there's no such thing as an innocent bystander. Because if, th, there's three things a bystander is doing if they don't do anything. They are letting the bully know they, they're giving the bully an audience. They're, um, not, they're being dishonest. They're not coming to the aid of the person. And, they're not fighting for what they believe in. 

00:18:10
NICK DUBIN Bullies count on bystanders. Basically. To either stand there and do nothing or to egg them on. And the reason a bully bullies is simple. It's a social activity, 85 percent of bullying takes place in the presence of other children. So the reason a bully bullies is because it's going to elevate their popularity. They're going to become more popular as a result. So, my line of reasoning is, wait a minute, if that's the reason why a lot of these kids are bullying, because they want to elevate their social status, we need to take away that incentive. 

00:18:45
Robert age 34 

00:18:45
ROBERT It's always funny cause there was always a group that was like the counter bully group, that was always there with the bullies. And, they would be the ones to bring your hat, or your book bag, or whatever back to ya. But they would never stop the bullies, because as soon as the bullies one of the bystanders help you out, then that person got bullied the next day. 

00:19:10
NICK DUBIN We need to create a culture where people automatically act as defenders. It's an, it would be an intuitive response. That's what we're looking for. 

00:19:20
Maxwell age 9 

00:19:20
MAXWELL They should take a stand, and they should go ask the bullies to stop and if they don't, then well, it's time to, um, tell somebody. 

00:19:30
NICK DUBIN I think a lot of parents tell their kids, if you see something going on and it's none of your business, stay out of it. So that get that message reinforced and maybe teachers reinforce that message. And, maybe that's why kids don't naturally come to the aid of somebody that's being abused. 

00:19:48
[music] 

00:19:48
NICK DUBIN Well I think inherently, human beings are good people. We are born good, and when we see somebody being victimized it's our natural instinct to want to come to the aid of that person. But in school for some reason, teachers have kinda hit home this whole tattling thing, that that's a bad thing to do, and, um, you should stay out of other people's business. And even those kids who come forward are often punished. The kids who are trying to help the kid who is being victimized are punished for it whereas they should be commended for it. You can see that the self-esteem of a bystander or even a participant is lowered because they weren't taught this is an inappropriate thing to do. They know it's inappropriate, I mean they know within their conscience it is inappropriate but they need an adult to tell them that. So, like I said, research across the board says the bystander is the key person in solving this problem. It's actually more important than teachers coming in and saying, ?Don't do that Johnny.? 

00:20:45
Solution 2. Empower the Bully 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
NICK DUBIN So, what can be done? Well I like the role reversal technique. And that is having the bully mentor, either his or her victim. Not always, or, another victim. Having the bully mentor somebody who is less powerful than him or herself could be a very, very healing and cathartic experience, I think for that person. He would learn in that instance that he can use his power for more constructive purposes, instead of using his power to cut someone down, so that he can boost his popularity. He can use that power to make somebody feel good and to help another person. And like I said the goal is to show the bully, that he or she can still be powerful but in a more constructive way. So we want to take their energies that they have and just redirect them. 

00:21:40
Solution 3. Empowering Schools 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:45
NICK DUBIN What are some of the things that can be done at the elementary level? Um, I think more, since kids are more impressionable when they're younger, more can be done at this age than by the time they reach middle school and high school. So, um, what I would do if I was the god of education, which I'm not, is I would have, um, anti-bullying assemblies, I don't know about once a month, but often where I would stress this point. Schools should, um, look for the popular children, who somebody who's respected and liked by their peers, as somebody who can come forward and mentor, the child with ASD. And that's going on with various school districts. At middle school and high school, what I would do is, I would have an email address, and I, this is something I would encourage you to talk to your school about, I would have an email address where, um, victims or bystanders could come forward and email a certain administrator about the bullying that is taking place at the schools. The reason why this is a good idea, in my opinion, is because there is, there is such a thing as cyber bullying and if there was something really, really offensive in an email like, a, a, swastika, I don't even know what, that could, that would be easy evidence. To be, it could be immediately forwarded to an, an administrator who could do something about it. I think schools should become very proactive in number one, learning about ASD and learning about the incidence of, um, bullying with ASD because it's pretty high. It's almost 100 percent. And they should know that what happens to a child who gets bullied, um, the after affects can be very, very serious. Death, suicide, um, low self-esteem in adulthood. Um, problems interacting with the opposite sex. So, if they don't care about that, then they can continue to take the approach that boys will be boys, etcetera, but if they do care about that and they want to save, possibly the lives of these children, then, then I would hope that they would become more proactive. I think on the first day of school there should be printed letters that go home to every single parent that spell out this policy. So I would encourage your teacher to create a policy. Better than that, I would encourage your school to create a policy because it should be consistent from class room to class room. Bringing guest speakers, one of the things I do here at Judson is, um, I go to schools and I, I would be giving this presentation to teachers and, um, administrators. So, if you feel this information is helpful, possibly you could pass that along. Um, another thing I would do is I would have anonymous student questionnaires. I know that there are some forms of which are in this book that you can use. Um, because students really know who are, who the targets are. They know where the bullying takes place. You can probably find a lot information out from your students if you took the time to put together an anonymous inventory that they could fill out once every two three months. Um, teacher in services that address this topic would be really important. Again, I think even if you're not going to have a bully court, you should have a bully register. There should be something in the main office of the school that keeps track of this kind of activity, and keeps track of these incidents so that somebodies a bullier, a constant bullier there's a record of it. 

00:25:00
Solution 4. Empowering Parents 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:10
NICK DUBIN I would encourage your child to enlist bystander support. I would actually go to your child's teacher and say, ?Look, you know, are there two or three students in your class, responsible students who you think can kinda look out for my kid?? And I really think that would dramatically reduce bullying. And if the teacher doesn't want to take it seriously, then I would go to that teacher, I would go to the principal and I would talk about it. I would get results by, having other kids in the classroom, if possible, kind of come to the aid of the child if they are, um, being bullied. 

00:25:43
[music] 

00:25:43
NICK DUBIN I think parents can reassure their children that people get nicer as they get older. People get more compassionate as you move through college and adulthood. That's not to say that bullying doesn't take place in adulthood but it doesn't take place with the frequency that it does when you're in middle school and high school. And also reassure the child that it's not his or her fault that bullies bully because of what's going on inside of them, not what's going on within the person who's being bullied. 

00:26:10
Solution 5. Empowering The Victim 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:15
Maxwell age 9 

00:26:15
MAXWELL Martial arts is self-defense and if you wanna be per, if you want bullying to be prevented from you, you need to use self-defense. I'm not saying you should use it as a weapon, just use it as a, some, I don't know exactly, but, you just, cause, you just need to use, you're not supposed to use it as a weapon, you just need to use it as pro, as, as like a shell as if you were a turtle to protect yourself from bull, from bullying. 

00:26:50
Andrew age 15 

00:26:50
ANDREW So what I do is I prepares a comeback to what they say and it's so witty and it's so Aspeian intellectual. 

00:27:00
MAXWELL Actually at the beginning of every class, the teacher even girls says, recites this, martials is a discipline of the body and the mind. And he also says, but it will also help you gain strength and self-defense. 

00:27:15
ANDREW They think they're going to embarrass me in front of the audience when I really end up embarrassing them in front of the audience. And sometimes, when I do that, people still think I wont have something else prepared when I do. And they come at me and say something and I come back with something else totally different. 

00:27:35
NICK DUBIN Kids on the spectrum have a great long term memory and if they can remember something in advance to say to the child, um, who's bullying him or her, that it could be very, very effective because you really don't need, um, I mean if you know, how, if that person is bullying you every day, basically you know what they're going to say in advance, and if you come up with a, with a comeback for that, you can rebut, what they're saying fairly effectively. 

00:28:00
MAXWELL I just don't know why bullying was ever invented. I don't know who, I don't know why. 

00:28:10
NICK DUBIN When I was a student, if people would've come to my aid, it would have increased my self-esteem number one, tremendously, but it would also have helped me from becoming victimized. And if kids care about other kids, which I know they do, then they should, that should be activated within them. We should, as adults, I think it's our responsibility really, to activate this within, um, our, our children who we teach. So, um, thanks for inviting me. Appreciate it.
