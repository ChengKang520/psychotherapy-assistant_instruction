ELEANOR SEATON Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Can everyone take their seats, so we can get started. Welcome to the race and cultural identity plenary session for the APA division 45 inaugural conference. My name is Eleanor Seaton and I will be your moderator. Before we start, I'd like to give you an outline of this session today. We're gonna have a brief five-minute introduction from our esteem panelists, which are comprised of Dr. Robert Sellers, Dr. Stephen Quintana, Dr. Bill Cross and Dr. Tiffany Yip. After the panelists have introduced themselves, they will give brief ten-minute presentations to two overarching questions that they have been given beforehand. After their ten-minute presentations for each question, we will open this up for audience participation. Now please there are two microphones in the middle of the amphitheater. This is being recorded, so I would ask that everyone please go to the microphone to articulate your questions or comments, so it can be audibly heard on the recording. So again right now we are gonna have our brief introductions from our panelists and our first panelist is the esteemed Dr. Bill Cross.

WILLIAM CROSS You'd think that we had never given a talk before, we're still trying to figure out how to do this. Ah... Bill Cross, I am a product of the 1960s and 70s. Ah... At that time, ah... we had a shift from the civil rights phase of the black, of the, of the black social movement to what was called a black consciousness or a black power phase. And during that time, ah... myself as well as my friends and people I didn't know seemed to be going through an identity shift. This identity shifting was picked up by about ten scholars, the late Charles Thomas ah... (inaudible ) of University of Pittsburgh and then myself, and it was just happenstance that my piece got picked by black world. Ah... It became therefore a foundational piece, but I want you to know there were other people who were, who were doing the same thing. Over time and space, I've gone in my writing from a rather linear discussion of identity in which we go from A to Z so to speak to try and to incorporate issues of lifespan and within the issue of lifespan asking the question ah... when black parents ah... in the community try to set out to raise their children, (inaudible ) allow me to use this term, in products, that is to say end identities. And so my, my recent work is try to define the range of identity types, if we can use that term that result from socialization. Particularly looking at the issue of salience or importance. Till not like the word centrality we'll get into that later. Ah... But salience in the sense that some people don't give it much salience, they're ergo(ph), they're, they're simulated or humanist, ah... all the way to people who give it a very high regard in the case of Afrocentrist and in the more hybrid or intersectional identity such as people who for a lack of a better phrase or multicultural. Ah... I've also tried to deal with issues of epiphanies, because they still occur. People start out as an adult or late adolescence with one kind of identity and often times they are at risk and something happens in their life and they shift. So my writings try to capture that. And then incorporating Tom Parham’s(ph) work on recycling. Recycling is a sense that we are never ever done, we are never, I won't use the word perfect, we're never formulated. There is always new issues that are raised, rasing your children, getting a divorce, having death in many cases, recently getting over cancer. These things cause you to rethink things. And so recycling is meant to capture that. So, and, and then finally, I’ve tried to back-up and, and even embrace generic psychology for lack of a better term, and that is to say how does ah... issues of personality relate to individuation, the individuation process of childhood? How does social identity back-up to issues of attachment? So that's the beauty of the thing that I've tried to deal with, ah... in my second little spiel, ah... I'll get more detail around issues of race and culture. Ah... As most of you probably know, I don't believe that they're, they're that separated. And so, ah... we will talk about that later. Is that 5 minutes? Right, okay, thanks.

STEPHEN QUINTANA Ah... It's a honor to be here and I really appreciate all the work that's gone into planning this conference. It's really a wonderful experience and really look forward to the future years of that. And it's very high honor for me to be a part of this panel. It's hard to follow-up ah... scholars such as Bill Cross and so forth, but I'll try to do my best in that. Ah... The perspective that I bring is, working with young children in sort of the developmental logic that they apply to understanding race and ethnicity and other social categories, the children adopt the language at a fairly early age in terms of being able to use race or racial terms, African-American or black or like Mexican-American, but they often don't have the ah... awareness of the dimensions of those terms. And so the research that I've done is somewhat similar to what others, the group interview children like (inaudible ) and Bill Cosby in terms of the children say the darndest things and so, I give them questions that they don't have a pat answer to and I'm really curious about what's the developmental logic that they use and be able to understand how... about their racial status. And ah... they give some precious responses. I'll just give you a, a couple of them, you know. One the questions is about racial constancy or ethnic constancy and as the children ah... in this case a Mexican-American child is; Can you ever change from being Mexican-American? And so she thinks and thinks a lot and she says; Well, when I am in the bathtub, I get all white and wrinkly at that time. Ah... I also had the opportunity to work with ah... look at different, ah... ethnic groups and one was the native Hawaiian group and so for the native Hawaiians asked; What can... Someone ever changed for being Hawaiian? And one boy says; Well, if he moved to Wyoming, he wouldn't be a Hawaiian anymore. So, ah... the young children are pretty naive about these sorts of things, ah... they progress and then they sort of see being a member of say a Mexican-American instead of (inaudible ) or Mexican and American and not really see the social consequences of that. So they speak English and Spanish or eat hamburgers and Mexican food and so forth. But then ah... as they progress along they develop an ability sort of take the perspective of others and sort of can be aware that others are gonna view them in a discriminatory fashion and so right around, ah... before the transition to middle school, ah... you will, it's really a market difference between the young children who can be so much naive about these sorts of things and then those kids who are precautious about the realities that the, that the, the world is facing them on that. And then, ah... as they move into our lessons they develop sort of an ethnic group consciousness that I think forms part of the social cognitive foundation for racial and ethnic identity. Ah... So that's the context in which I am sort of approaching these things and so, one theme throughout that is, there's sort of breakdown race ethnicity in these complex constructs into their component dimensions and be aware of the dimensions that are being tapped at this point. It's so obviously the young kids are aware of a certain perspective dependent on their cognitive level and developmental level. Ah... But I think in terms of our measurements and so forth is that there is a certain dimension that's picked up by that and I think we need to be very aware of those things to better understand the kind of the context in which these things are being completed or the meaning behind that. So, how's that? Thanks.

ROBERT SELLERS Good afternoon. Ah... I am Robert Sellers and I just gotta tell you little bit about ah... the approach that I take in ah... looking at racial identity. And first I should start off with, ah... when I say the approach that I take it is really the approach that has evolved over ah... a number of wonderful collaborations ah... with great group of graduate students over 20 years now. Ah... Basically I come to the issue of studying racial identity ah... from a perspective where I really wanted to understand ah... something different and a basic question about why is it that... that African-Americans die so young? This is a question that I was interested in as an ah... undergraduate student at Howard University. Ah... I was trying to figure out ah... the answer to that ah... in a relatively naive way from a psychological perspective. In doing so, ah... I thought that the notion of race had to play some part of this and in particular the notion of the question ah... that ah... probably most of us in this room understand, and that's the question or the added ah... interpretation that we often have to face. So, as a ah... a Ph.D psychologist, ah... often times giving talks at different universities or conferences etc. ah... probably every other talk someone comes up and says; Wow, you're really articulate! And... So, there is the calculation of whether or not to be offended or to be complimented and there are thousand of those calculations that one has to make throughout the day and so as an undergraduate, I thought that, that calculation must be part of why African-Americans die so young. And again thinking about this, it was also very clear to me that African-Americans vary, that ah... when we think about race, when we talk about race and what race means to us that the African-Americans that I know and I've come across and I have seen, ah... vary a great deal in terms of the answer to that question. And then the, the, the third piece that ah... was important or informs the way that I work and I do work is that, it always seemed to me that when I read ah... mainstream literature on identity and particularly as it related to African-Americans, ah... they really didn't look like the people that I knew. And often times it was a historical, a cultural, a flavorful and deficit oriented and so in trying to ah... talk about racial identity, particularly African-American racial identity, I've tried to ah... take us at least one step closer to better representing ah... the folks that I know.

00:12:15
TIFFANY YIP Adjust these a little bit. Ah... Good afternoon everyone. It's my pleasure to be here. Ah... Eleanor and I have been dreaming about this panel for, for a few years now, so it's really nice to, to have it be a reality today. Ah... My name is Tiffany Yip and ah... I study the fluidity of identity. So, ah... in Rolph's(ph), he talks about this idea of this notion of salience and salience is this idea that, that, that identity varies over time and I come into this research based on my own experiences as, as an Asian-American, ah... born in California, growing up in Texas, Illinois, Hong Kong, and then going to ah... college in Upstate, New York and then moving to New York City. After that, I mean all these sort of, in all these different places I had to sort of redefine who I was in these various context and so I began to be really interested in how context shapes the variability and identity, not just over, you know, adolescence to young adulthood and so on, but in the day-to-day experiences. So, I would notice that when I was in Chinatown in New York, I felt extremely Chinese, right. So there were something about the context. Something about being in an area where there is Chinese food, Chinese language, Chinese individuals that made my identity very salient. And at the same time I noticed that comments like, you know, go back to your country. Those comments also made my identity very salient. So there are very different context, very different triggers and yet the result is sort of similar and so that's where I, I became really interested in looking at the variability and identity across individuals, across ah... context over time. Ah... And... And my work has been influenced very much by all the members on the panel, so I am really excited to, to begin our discussion. 

00:14:15
ELEANOR SEATON Okay. So, are we ready? We're gonna have a great discussion. Ah... Now two points of emanation, ah... if you, if someone makes a comment that you wanna ask a question about a response, you please jot that down, Rob as well as Tiffany and all of us intended for this to be a discussion and again once they've finished their presentations we want to discuss these issues. So please feel free to jot down ideas or questions and after their presentations we are gonna have a round table discussion about these issues. This is not a class. This is not a lecture. This is a discussion, okay. Okay. Second point, ah... there are gonna be some places where we will disagree. It's... We have this many people in the room, we have this many opinions, however we are going to disagree agreeably. Now, I just want to make that clear, 'coz I know our panelists disagree on some issues, but again as long as we do it in a spirit of agreement, I think the end result will be wonderful. Okay, so the first question, ah... Well, let's see. How do I... Okay. Ah... I want to show the question. No? Don't show the question? Hahaha... See, this is a Mac. This is what we give for a Mac. I am a PC person. 

00:15:45
ROBERT SELLERS That's right, boo her, boo her. 

00:15:45
ELEANOR SEATON Oh! Where're my PC users? See. Okay. Bet we outnumber the Mac users. Yeah, that's it. Okay. So, our first question, again our panelists were provided with the questions prior. First question, how do we disentangle race, ethnicity and culture, while at the same time acknowledging the interplay between these constructs? 

00:16:15
Questions How do we disentangle race, ethnicity and culture, while at the same time acknowledging the interplay between these constructs? 

00:16:15
ELEANOR SEATON Again all of us might use various terms when we talk about identity, ethnic identity, racial identity etc. So, our panelists have 10 minutes to respond to this question. And our first panelist will be Dr. Bill Cross. Hahaha... I can't. Okay, you're gonna tell me how and then I am gonna go, right? 

00:16:45

00:16:50
ELEANOR SEATON Okay, all right. 

00:16:55

00:17:00
WILLIAM CROSS Ah... Already talked about the early stuff, okay. Ah... For me, ah... I just start up by saying, I wish the point where I am having trouble making a distinction between racial identity and cultural identity. So that in most of my work I hyphenate it. I say racial-cultural. I ah... tend to rely on something called ideology and that is to say how... 

00:17:25
Defining ideology • Mental-cognitive schema; Core meaning making frame; • Group or groups do I feel attached; • Level of salience/importance [not centrality] accorded group; • Sense of history, what needs to be known-taught; what needs to be protected-cherished-celebrated-enjoyed, what needs to be changed; who can participate 

00:17:25
WILLIAM CROSS ...I think that there... the structure of identity is important, but most of my work has tried to pinpoint ah... the different kinds of frames of reference that people organize to explain their racial-cultural identity. So if you will you could call it a mental or cognitive schema ah... that deals with the core meaning of, meaning, a, a, a core meaning making frame, it has to do with a group or groups, ah... it should be to which I feel attached, it has to do with a level of salience or importance accorded the group. Ah... This is not meant to be argumentative. I find out when you use the term centrality with multicultural or biracial, they don't like that term. But if you ask them to talk about the importance of race in the context of your hybrid identity they tend to be more relaxed, so I, I... So as in some ways, it's another variant of centrality. And I think also ideology has to do with the sense of history. It has such questions as what needs to be known or taught? What needs to be protected, cherished, celebrated and enjoyed? What needs to be changed and who can participate? So if I am an Afrocentrist, the participants have to be other African-Americans. If I am a multiculturalist, this opens it up to other groups. So this is in a general sense how I am using identity. Ah... Identity to me, it speaks to these levels, I have not dealt with the issue of feeling, but that's built in to the issue of attachment. Ah... With regard to defining race versus culture, you can do that, but that's not our discourse, our discourse is the issue of identity. And so in research, we're trying to figure out how does one trigger a sense of who is my group or what group do I belong to? And there is where I believe that in fact they're highly related. 

00:19:25
Triggering a Sense of My Group • Attachment & belonging as cultural • Representations are "racial-cultural" • Exemplars: - Negro or Black - African American - African Descent - Niger; "Niggas" 

00:19:25
WILLIAM CROSS So, in a sense when people use such terms as Negro or Black, there can be instances when they're referring to it as a racial marker, but when I was teaching in black studies, we often would refer it to black music, black literature, black drama. So there was a way in which when we spoke about psychology, we some how orally racialized the concept, but when we moved to other disciplines we felt very comfortable, in a sense referring to them as, as cultural markers. And likewise, whether we're talking about it as people with African-American or African descent or ah... they were Niger or Niggas, in a sense those terms depending upon who uses it and in which context can trigger a, a racial marker or a cultural marker. So, I am not saying that we can’t define these terms differently, but when it gets to the issue of identity, if a person feels comfortable being of African descent, they usually will also feel comfortably calling black, sometimes Negro or that's not, that’s not usually the case and they will often not flip flop, but move back and forth between a highly racialized notion of blackness to a very culturalized notion. So I think in fact they are more fused than they're not. And I just want to remind us of something, because sometimes we think the originators of these terms that they were more clear, because we have the history of the scientific racism, I just want you to remind you this. 

00:20:45
A Bit of History • Inventors of "race" conflated race & culture; • Different races had different cultures • Race was a way of ranking cultures! • Race as blackness, race as being a Jew; race as Hutu or Tutsi, race as speaking Spanish, etc. • Race is "whatever"...... 

00:20:45
WILLIAM CROSS The inventors of a category, race originally conflated race and culture. So this notion of separating them out, if you go back and study the origins of these terms even the people who originated the notion of race often confuse. In fact, we often believe that different races had different cultures and that in a sense they could use race as a proxy for doing what, ranking the cultures. So, French culture was thought to be better than Nigerian culture, if you will. So there is a way in which there were flip flop between race and culture. And history shows us this kind of flip flopping or conflation and sometimes it's rather ugly, but race can be blackness, race can be ah... being a Jew, it can be Hutu, being Tutsi, if, if you will there had been wars or genocide committed by people, who would use these terms of a marker as race and yet often times the combatants would be cultural. So in a sense we don't usually think of someone who is, as a Jew is racial, but the Germans did, and they would argue that their what, their religion and their culture was somehow inferior. In this sense it brings us to make my concluding remark that when we're talking about race, that can be whatever you make it, if you have power, okay. So I can, I can turn the speaking of Spanish into race, okay. And ultimately we're saying race is really a marker of stigma, stigma. In a sense I can stigmatize culture, I can stigmatize physicality. But in the lived experience, which is a dubious notion, okay, I would say, I would even replace this notion of twoness with threeness. He was saying that; "Yes, the person out there was seeing me as an object, but when they called me Negro, when they called me whatever, I didn't cease being a cultural being, okay. They weren't trying to address it, but I was still, I was a Negro-black in the cultural sense, okay. I also because I identified with the group, understood that I did not deny being black as, as, as being, although it was being used in a derogatory sense by the person who is the, the instigator.” Five minutes, okay, great. Ah... But there is also, then we won't have much time to get into this, beside being a cultural being, a object of stigma, I am also a individual person. So there is this issue of personality. So in a sense I might be shy, I might be gregarious or whatever, but of course the dubious is twoness was focusing on the cultural object. So, in my writings, I don't know if I am doing good job, today, I mean, in any case it's rather hard for the person who is a recipient of these markers to separate them out. And so there are times when I think I know what we mean by race and I would like thank because I identify with a larger notion of black culture then under most circumstances I will accept the marker Black as a racial marker. But then when you probe my consciousness, it turns out, I'd link that to Miles Davis to ah... I'm blocking on the great player ah... Lorraine Hansberry and I don't think that in a sense they are separating these out and finally in some of my writings, I've been inspired by Rob, but particularly I wanna speak to Stephens, Stephen, right, yes, Stephen's work. In my anxiety I'm, I am inventing and giving you new names, okay. He did a wonderful study, I don’t mean to take stuff away from him, but if (inaudible ) whatever, okay. Little kids, I think it's most (inaudible ) kids, ah... who is best prepared for discussions of race, discrimination, okay. Well, it turns out for those parents who intended to highlight the issue of discrimination, that was not a very good preparation for those kids to encounter discrimination. The best ah... preparation is when they were first grounded in their (inaudible ) my, my phrase okay, so, so that in a sense embedded in the ah... groundedness in blackness, in Jewishness and so on, is an understanding that there are gonna be other people who won't see to this way, okay, and they will try to racialize you. So ironically, my best preparation for those encounters is a cultural, is a cultural frame and therefore this causes people at least to see the two. Now when, people, (inaudible ) minute or two, when people are new immigrants, it will often separate these pieces out. But as research has shown, people who come here from Haiti from Ireland and whatever, they will first stress their nationality. But what is interesting especially for Asians, Jamaicans and the Irish and Canadians, over time they will incorporate a notion of; "I am a white American or I am a black American, or I am a black African”, and what they are doing again is understanding that the markers for themselves have a discriminatory racial bench of piece to it, but they also have a cultural piece. And that doesn't mean we can’t find outliers who separate these out. Ah... So in summary, I would argue that these, these dimensions have been argued theoretically as being separate, but in the real world when one researcher, I think it was ah... Robert Carter at Teachers College, set out to show the difference between racial identity and cultural identity using the (inaudible ) and then using the mind. He was total surprised when they were correlated. But they were correlated at 0.55. Hahaha... I mean, this is a whopping correlation and that kind of overlap has been repeated in other studies. So, in my own work it's ironic. I am, I have an albatross, it's not an albatross, but I am laden with the notion of, I'm stuck, an expert on racial identity and I’ve declared in my writing now I'll do it in public. No, I am an expert on racial-cultural identity and I do that because the interplay for the, the best level of mental health for our children, for ourselves as adult is to understand that they are fused and then finally in, in the, I guess I can squeeze this soon. I tried to focus on the lived experience and I have argued that some situations will trigger my, (inaudible ) okay, okay, that's it, it's okay. In the... In the lived experience there are situations I trigger my being defensive, that's the more race based but there are other times when I cross over to the mainstream, code switching/bridging there are other times when I lead myself, I'd not lead myself, I am, I am immersed in my group and therefore I show attachment. And then there are other times when in the sense I am living what my individuality, my corkiness(ph) and so on. And when you... And that helps to explain in the lived experience, how in a sense I operate best when I don't battle these two markers, I find a way to fuse them together and understand that some situations were one dimension and competencies, some situations will trigger the other. Okay, thank you. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:10
STEPHEN QUINTANA Ah... There has been different iterations(ph) for how we are gonna proceed with this and so, my PowerPoint was prepared this sort of the introduction. So I am gonna wing it a little bit in terms of this part. I just really want to ah... appreciate Bill Cross and I really wanna echo his sense about the way in which the lived experience really cuts across and so, as I am talking to these children, they're really not making these big distinction between race and ethnicity and, and culture. Many of them really only understand say the racial component of it based upon skin color and then as they get older they are able to integrate more, some different perspectives of that. But even the high schoolers will vary even in the same ah... sentence for the same interview questions, ah... in terms of referring to ah... their group identifier as a racial term or a cultural term or an ethnic term. And the perspective I wanna bring to this discussion is that, these are ah... race and ethnicity and culture can all be defined ah... in demographic terms. So they're demographic variables and so forth. And so what, as psychologists we're interested in the psychological implications of those. And so even if they are different demographic characteristics and we gonna find them as differently, it doesn't necessarily mean that there are different psychological implications from that, ah... those experiences. And also I wanna point out that a lot of debate over it, how much overlap between race and ethnicity is ah... important(ph) empirical question. We can look at the data and we can kind of see, what, how much, what the data says in terms of the amount of overlap ah... between race, ethnicity and (inaudible ) culture. And that... And the data is ah... is fairly clear on, there is quite a bit of data if you will on, when children or adolescence use for this ethnic labels that their similar relationships whether they specify a racial label, or an ethnic label, or in some cases a, a cultural label. So, all the work with using (inaudible ) asked them to identify their own group many times and then they will put in whatever they have with regardless of what they put in that these relationships are sort of, ah... fairly well established. And also ah... you know looking at high school adjustment and so forth that, looking at the different terms that they, adolescence pick and it doesn't, ah... their adjustment levels are not predicted by whether they identify within an ethnic, cultural or a racial element. But it really is the investment that they have in that ah... term that would then ah... predict adjustment and so forth. So, ah... that's the perspective I bring to it and I think it's really is integrated in the lived experiences as well as in the psychological implications. Ah... What I think is important for us to develop a diversity science, and particularly related to ethnic identity is to be able to identify the different dimensions that underlie ethnic identity or racial identity. And many times ah... that they are confounded and so ah... part of the findings that Bill had mentioned is that the, the large relationship between racial identity and ethnic identity is that, that level, but when we're in a study and we only give one measure say, racial identity measure, ah... even though that's overlapping with the cultural identity, we are gonna interpret the findings based upon that this must be have something to do with the way in which they've overcome discrimination or racism and it really maybe due to their ah... cultural identity and the notions that they have about how, about their own culture and so forth. One example of that was, a student at UW ah... looked at ah... attitudes toward counseling and gave a racial measure and also gave a, ah... ethnic or cultural measure of it, both of them are very highly correlated, ah... but what we found is that, it was like ah... variance on the cultural identity that predicted the attitudes toward counseling and there was no variance left over for the racial identity one. And so that have big implications for the, ah... for how we are gonna then try to increase ah... students access to counseling in a sense, maybe it's the cultural mismatch that there is between counseling ah... and some clients that we're trying to reach out for. Ah... Also there are some many over lapses, other demographic characteristics such as social class and so I think I just need to mention that, I don't think I need to go into too much detail in terms of that there is a tremendous amount of overlap with that and again when we only give a single measure and that it's confounded with say racial identity or social class and so forth, it's very hard for us to interpret the results ah... that we have in terms of being, is it really racial, is it class-based and so forth. So I think we need to be pretty intentional in terms of how we're gonna separate this out and be very careful about our theorizing, so that we are gonna attribute to the dimensions of race, that ah... is really operating at this, in this study and so forth. And one thing I want to distinguish on the ethnic identity and sort of connect it back into ah... ego identity according to the Erikson's word, is that Erikson made a distinction between self-identity and ego identity. In the self-identity would be the self-concepts, it sort of be the product of ego identity in terms of how the adolescence filtered experience to develop a sense of who they are, and then they would have this construct at themselves and then that will separate from the ego identity which is really this filtering process. And so I think for ethnic and racial identity, we notice that ah... ethnic identity provides a nice buffer against racism, developing ethnic pride and so forth. It allows the adolescent to be ah... somewhat immune to some of those facts of racism and discrimination. And if we attribute it to their ah... ethnic self-concepts if you will. Okay. Then we might be missing the board in fact, ah... that ethnic identity probably has this filtering process that children, adolescence use to filter through the messages that they've been given, the discriminatory or stigmatizing messages that they have. So I'd like to focus a little bit more on that process of how that's filtered and the interviews I've done so far, it seems to be that, ah... the filtering process is a product of socialization largely from parents, so the parents teach them, or when someone says that to you, this is how you respond or you, this is how you act and that way, and then over time, ah... and, you know the larger community also reinforces that, that notion and then over time, ah... the adolescent internalizes that and was able to do that on, on his or her own, ah... having the social cognitive abilities to be able to do so. And in other way to sort of tease apart, you know, we can't randomly sign race that ethnic status and so forth, so ah... one of the topics that's raised for this was about the biracial or multiracial context and it's really interesting to have racial status be consistent, but ah... pick out ah... biracial people who identify in different ways, and so now we were able to look at race and ethnicity and racial identification in different context. So I think we can be pretty creative in terms of how we can use what's available to us to be able to better understand those underlying dimensions. Thank you.

ROBERT SELLERS Okay, so I also I'm gonna forego my slides, ah... It's a little different than what we've ah... talked about before in the sense that I am now going to give you an introduction to the MMRI, if you don't know the Multidimensional Model Racial Identity you better ask somebody. No, I was just kidding, sorry, couldn't, couldn't help it, couldn't help it, no. You know, ah... I wanna also echo something that Tiffany had mentioned earlier. This is something that I have been looking forward to ah... for a very long time. The folks of this panel are people who have greatly influenced my thinking on this and continue to influence my thinking. And when I, whenever I hear them talk or read their work, I often have to come back and rethink, what I think I think. Ah... And... So, I am not sure, what I am gonna say with regard to this issue of race and culture is any different from what the two panelists have actually said, but I am gonna ah... throw something out there anyway. For me, trying to understand race and culture has always been done within the context of understanding African-Americans experiences. And over time, I realized that I wasn't smart enough to understand the distinction between race and culture. Basically, because for that lived experience, it's very difficult to ask the average person, what that difference means though the average person clearly thinks that they're meaningful and over time, what I've realized in thinking about race and culture in the context of identity, is that often times we really aren't talking about anything different. We're really talking about your as, ah... ah... Bill uses quite adequately(ph) is your reference group orientation, who is your group? And because of a historical ah... where we are in history, issues of power, issues of ah... hegemony, ah... that group for many of us, for example, we're African-Americans, ah... it's the concept of race in America that links us together. It's not the concept of culture as purely defined that links us together, it's the concept of race, the notion that you all are in the same group and if something jumps off, you all are gonna have it happen and to give you my brief Vijay Singh reference. Any of you are familiar with Vijay Singh? So, Vijay Singh is a Fijian golfer. And as I started watching golf, I started routing for Vijay Singh. I knew Vijay was Fijian. I knew culturally Vijay was Fijian. Vijay will tell he's Fijian. But if Vijay walked in this room, you might think Vijay is black. And even though intellectually I knew that he was Fijian and all the other golfers he was golfing against pre-Tiger ah... particularly the American ones had more in common with me culturally than Vijay, but my connection was to Vijay, because of race and the only thing that explains this is the concept of race and how race has unfolded in American society that links us together that makes that sense. So often times, when I ah... see ah... measures of ethnic identity and racial identity, if you look at the items they are the same items. If you look at our scale, you look at Jean scale, may of the items are basically the same items. We're asking the same questions. The only difference is what do we label them? What are the groups that we label? And so I used to think, well maybe this is just an African-American, African problem, how do you ah... play that out. But when you start thinking about other groups, ah... Asian-American, what does that mean? Absolutely nothing, unless you're in this particular historical, cultural... historical space. If you are of ah... ah... Pakistani descent, you probably have very little in common historically with being Filipino, unless you are here or in a place where that Asian-American ah... label gets placed on you. But... But, something strange and important happens. We as humans, we are all about meaning making. That's the one thing that we do is we're about meaning making and so once we get put in categories and those categories have meaning, we are not passive victims to those categories. We begin to make meaning about why those categories are important, relevant and ultimately become in many cases protective. We get feelings around it. So, being Asian-American in a particular context can have real meaning, because you have an in-group, becomes the reference group and from that meaning making, you end up having traditions or behaviors, common behaviors that have meaning that become traditions, and then over time becomes cus... customs that become in time what defines who you are as a group and why you are important and so this distinction to me between race and culture from an identity perspective is one that really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, ah... what we’re really talking about is reference groups that have meaning to the individuals that we're talking, that we’re talking about and as ah... Steve had mentioned, then we start wandering how does these dimensions play out. So, it’s not just about being in the group. So, then you have attitudes and beliefs about how important that group is to you, which people vary within the group. Then you have attitudes and beliefs about what the group actually means. So what does it mean to be black? What does it mean to be Latino? What does it mean to be ah... Vietnamese? All of these are things that come out as a function of a group meaning making process that often times is inclusive as well as very exclusive. And so when we’re thinking about identity and we’re thinking about racial and ethnic identity, I think for too long we’ve been battling this fast dichotomy, ah... so, again, and Jean, we had invited Jean to be on the panel and unfortunately Jean couldn't make it. But what, what often happens is, I get people who will call and say, ah... "Dr. Sellers, I’m interested in using your measure, but I wanna use it with other groups". Ah... And... And I say; “Well," actually the measure was developed with African-Americans in mind, ah... it's not that I don’t think that there maybe some aspects of it that’s relative to others experiences, but that’s the group that I knew, I felt like I knew enough about after studying not just because I was African-American I knew it, but after spending a great deal of time studying that experience, that I felt comfortable enough to say that we think this is what model fits and if you’re gonna do a model for the group that you’re thinking about, you wanna embed it in their particular experience(ph). And then the person usually goes away and says, "okay well, I'll go and use ah... ah... Finney's(ph) ethnic, I did mime because it’s with multiple groups". Without any real understanding of what they’re actually measuring. It's not that I’m saying, oh no you shouldn’t use the mime, but too often we had still racial identity as if one notion of racial identity is the same thing as any other notion, so centrality, salience, exploration, affirmation, all of these are the same and we have a measure of racial identity, and then we compare it to something else. We see if it’s related to a particular outcome or not. That to me is very, very problematic and it ah... undermines again the real notion of what race and ethnicity could be in terms of a construct and how it plays up. So, I’m actually gonna sit down there, because I’m much more interested in our, ah... conversation than I am ah... and me standing up and taking at you. So, Tiffany. 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
TIFFANY YIP Ah... I think I’m going to, I guess maybe there's one of the points what we do agree as a panel, echo a lot of things that others have already said and, and thinking about the distinction between the race, culture and ethnicity. Ah... We and ah... And when I was thinking about how to address this in the panel, I turned to some of the qualitative interviews that we’re doing with 11 and 12th graders in New York City School System and we simply asked these adolescence you know, how do you think about yourself in terms of race and ethnicity? A fairly straightforward simple question, but as we know not a very straightforward and simple answer. And so one students says, "I’m Dominican, Haitian, native American, but I don’t really know what I am. But when you ask me to fill out surveys and questionnaires, I fill out the African-American bubble automatically. But I don’t really know what I am and some people even consider me Asian. So, I guess I’m native American, but I’m obviously more black and that was her answer. And so to me, it highlighted the fact that these distinctions may not be so real, at least maybe for adolescence samples. They maybe more real for adults. It’s possible, possibly there is developmental differences in terms of thinking about these distinctions. So, it’s possible that as individuals get older over time that may be these distinctions become more distinct, but it’s not clear that that’s the case. But it appears in some of Steven's work and in some of our work with, with high school students at least that’s not the case. Ah... And then perhaps thinking about ah... individual differences, so maybe for some individuals ah... these distinctions will become more real over time and maybe they won't. For some individuals, the concept of race, ethnicity, culture, in terms of identity may never be distinct from each other and for some individuals for example maybe people in this room who really think about these issues, they maybe more distinct in, in daily life. And then, also maybe thinking about group differences. So, maybe for some groups in the United States, the distinction between race, culture and ethnicity maybe more different than others. And so, I think, ah... I don’t think we have good answers yet about how much these constructs are interrelated and how much they are distinct. And I think that there maybe a lot of differences in the extent to which these constructs are related or not related and to think about these in terms of developmental context, to think about these in terms of unique histories and experiences of groups in the United States and to think about them in terms of individual differences. Some people may just be more thoughtful, and maybe it’s related to notions of centrality, whether or not people will make distinctions between these constructs. So, thank you.

ELEANOR SEATON Okay. So, first question, ah... questions, comments, feedback from the audience. There are two microphones in the middle. This is your time to ask our panelists the hard questions, to pick their brains. 

00:47:30
Thanks a lot. 

00:47:35
Okay. I am fortunate. Ah... But I think the (inaudible ) and acknowledgement. I, I always think that (inaudible ) that prospects ah... that I enjoy. And I was thinking that I think about brave, confident that I could thinking about (inaudible ). So, I’m (inaudible ) myself or what, what this means, ah... Yeah, I think about race (inaudible ) about my progress, it is like this way or that way every day. Ah... So I’m trying to understand ah... what are you all saying about distinguishing the (inaudible ) panel. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:50
WILLIAM CROSS It’s on, it’s on. You can define race and culture differently. That’s not the same thing it's when you're studying identity. In identity, you’re asking a different kind of question. You’re asking the lack of (inaudible ). How is race and ethnicity lived? And that is why in the sense they're lived often and they’re connected. It's not that they’re the same, but they’re connected. So, ironically just to repeat myself, there is, there is reason to believe that in order to prepare yourself of, as a young kid over time to deal with racism, okay, it is better that you be deeply rooted in culture. If I had to give an explanation for this, you would be vowed. That in studying culture often times what you're asked to do with (inaudible ), you, you adjust with how you dance, your (inaudible ) and so on, there are bound to be instances however, when you have discussions about how some people will reject your religion, would reject your culture, would define your language as inferior. So in a sense, in a cultural frame, I get two frames. The frame that my parents would hope that I embrace, we are also in awareness that not everybody believes the way my parents do and then there is the raw episode of being rejected, okay. While it turns out, the more I know culture, the better preparation I can to negotiate race. Therefore as an identity dynamic, we should not be surprised, not with the measures that're totally overlap, because they don't. But they are highly correlated, and so in a sense it's almost saying to us as researchers, thereof that we have both the measures plus, okay as supposed to one and the other, I think, I think (inaudible ) point of view. There in a sense, if you use one measure, do you have the right to automatically speak about the other and if you do that, then you're, I think you are making a mistake, but don't be surprised if you use two measures, that in some instances they were greatly overlapped, while at the same time as Stephen said, also pointing to ways in which the variance separate out. That's, you know./ 

00:51:05
TIFFANY YIP I mean to follow on Bill’s point I think that ah… you know we can all come up with a definition of what’s race? What’s ethnicity? What’s culture? But like you’re saying when it gets enacted in your identity when it becomes part of who you are, it's not clear that those three things don’t overlap more than we think they do as illustrated in… in… in some of the research that’s on the topic. Ah, and so I think we can come up with these very academic definitions of what these thing are. But then when we talk about this lived(ph) experience, when we talk about day-to-day interactions, the day-to-day experiences those distinctions become a little less clear. 

00:51:50
Can you hold the microphone… 

00:51:55
TIFFANY YIP Yes they are… 

00:51:55
WILLIAM CROSS Can I give one more example? 

00:52:00
Yeah sure, fantastic. 

00:52:00
WILLIAM CROSS In… in… in the research using the cress(ph) people who are Afrocentric are usually very sensitive to the presence and the perception of racism in their environment. People who are simulated often show a negative correlation to the perception of racism and the experience of racism. In… in a… in a sense your frame of reference can be one in which you fuse them and therefore you’re not surprised by them, but you can have also have a frame of reference as in an assimilationist and a humanist, I don’t have a humanist scale, but I believe they… you relate heavily to what Robert measures. The irony is that those perceptions actually don’t even see race or they see less of it and one with. Now, this is may be now of being ah… gross speculation. If we could follow such people across time and space there is a greater probability that the assimilationist is going to be surprised not prepared for racial episodes unless they can live in another cocoon, but in a situation where they are protected. On the other hand, the persons who are Afrocentric to a strong degree they may have the parry on another kind of issue not only being protected against racism, but sometimes seeing it worse not there. Am I making sense, so in a sense it's so critical for us to understand is not just the presence of race and cult(ph), it's how do you configure it. Whereas Bob has said how do you make meaning of these things and ironically there are some African-Americans, who were surprised by Rodney King was being beaten up and when he was beaten up they said I wonder what he did? And then there were others who were not less surprised. So it’s a combination of these things exist, but how do you, how are you taught race by your community whatever to negotiate them, to put them together. 

00:53:55
STEPHEN QUINTANA What I would like to describe is when ah… develop mentally when the children become aware of these different dimensions and so I… I would encourage. I think understanding is that ah, you know was said before the reference group orientation does involve racial component, and cultural component and so on and so forth. And I think the more our components that individuals have for understanding their reference group that better prepared they are for discrimination. But what was particularly, I guess a poignant in working with the children is that I would ask them, ah… you know why would someone not like Mexican-Americans or African-Americans (inaudible ) why would someone be prejudice. And so those kids that only define their ethnicity based upon where their parents were born, where their ancestors were born. The most common response I got was, I don’t know why and I think to some degree when it exceeded their ability to sort of understand why they were… whey someone would be prejudice then it was somewhat traumatic in nature in the sense that they couldn’t really represent and be able to sort of predict when these things might happen. But as the children got older they… they could realize that someone's negative attitude toward them may have more to do with them than with ah… with other person than with themselves. So, I think by having a multifaceted awareness of the reference group I think that the children at least develop greater capacities to better understand their world and better ah… buffer against some negative messages. 

00:55:25
ROBERT SELLERS And I guess I still… ah… I still think it’s important to distinguish between race when we're talking about the context of the identity, because often times when we talk about race and ethnic identity, I guess I actually I’m not sure that there is any difference between race and ethnic identity the way that we traditionally use it that what we usually are measuring is your attitudes and beliefs about a particular group and what determines whether or not it’s an ethnic group or racial group has historically been whether or not you’re African-American and so because the racial identity literature an African-American started off looking at race and racism and then ah… the attempt to ah… use that ah… ah… and also thinking about other ethnic minority groups. The race didn’t make sense. It didn’t, it didn’t fit, so we settle our ethnicity is really the case without really interrogating the distinctions between race and ethnicity. So I mean, I… I would disagree a little bit Bill in the sense that I would not, I… I don’t think that there is any difference, the reason why they're so highly correlated is because they are measuring the same… same things. So, if you ask me do I think being African-American as a racial group or an ethnic group ah… my scores on the maim(ph) are gonna be exactly the same, if… if I think it’s a ethnic group and I scored is gonna be the same as if I think it’s a racial group had scored. The only way you would get difference as if you told me that they're both and obviously the demand characteristic would then say why, you asked me this question first as a ethnic group, so you must be looking for something different when you said the racial group. So I guess from that perspective it’s not to say that there is a culture that ah… ah… there isn't a distinction, but I think when we usually are talking about racial and ethnic identity ah… there isn't the distinction. I do think their culture can also play a important ah, buffering or cocooning effect in terms of combating discrimination. But I think it does so not necessarily because of the culture itself, but in part to answer a point that Steve had mentioned. It gives you… so one of the things about discrimination is it dehumanizes you. It… it says that you are not human you are somehow less than… having a cultural frame, most of our culture actually just about all cultures that we develop the first thing that we do is explain why we are important and every culture is the chosen culture ah… no one has the culture that’s not the chosen culture and so having a cultural frame that is based on who you are and saying that you're the important one versus the cultural frame that says you’re not the important one. You’re not the American, you are the hyphened American and so therefore not the one put you at risk. So having a cultural identity that backs up that I’m important is what buffers you. And the racial identity piece that also can be helpful in buffering is understanding that racism exists and that it can have an impact and giving you other people to work with, to talk to, to develop effective coping strategies, effective coping resources to let you know that it isn't you, it’s them, it’s the world etc. That I think is plays out. So I think we agree a lot more than we ahh… disagree. But I… I just don’t… I'm at a point where I… I… I have been struggling with trying to understand the race and ethnicity and I think the way that we tend to use it is really conflated and that there really isn't a difference in terms of how we’re measuring it. 

00:59:35
WILLIAM CROSS Not to do dukes but… 

00:59:35
ROBERT SELLERS Oh, yeah. No… no… no… yeah… ahh… 

00:59:40
WILLIAM CROSS I… I… I would argue that we should for a while ahh… explore the use of both instruments with other instruments with because of history. Ahh, once it was discovered that group identity is not the same thing as self-esteem. Back in the 60s sometimes researchers stop measuring group identity and they only measured self-esteem, you are with me, okay. So now they are correlated, okay. In most of the time people who have a healthy group identity will also show a high correlation with self-esteem. But the researchers such as Margaret, such as Harriet Martineau, the late(ph) Harriet Martineau(ph), Margaret Spencer when they would use both instruments despite they are (inaudible ) and they use it in conjunction with may be a third or fourth instrument. It just gave us more details about it. So we’re on the same page, but for a while I would like to… to recommend to people use both but probably not just those two but in conjunction with other variables. And that… that may end up being the probably a part of piece not where 20% of the variance is being accountable. 

01:00:45
ROBERT SELLERS Ummm… 

01:00:45
WILLIAM CROSS But that there are some variance out there, they just overlook to be used one versus the other even though they are very… they are very much related. So I’m sorry I forget the name of the woman from University of Illinois. She talked about… she used that the… that your task… your, your, your piece. But she also used an attachment measure. 

01:01:00
ROBERT SELLERS Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:05
WILLIAM CROSS And that attachment measure prove to be very powerful getting out that underlying emotionality in connection that one can find. So she used it and then and… and move beyond that. Here we are. Thank you. 

01:01:20
TIFFANY YIP Okay, anybody else any other thoughts? 

01:01:20
ROBERT SELLERS Well, can I just say I would… I would agree that you want multiple measures and that their different aspects of identity that are being measured differently. So for example hum… ah… (inaudible ) measure are the minor(ph) ahh… that the concept of exploration, the concept of commitment is very different from the kinds of things that we measure in the ahh… may be and to a degree of you would say probably depressing(ph) others. And so having those together did she knew ahh… ahh… extra information and you would expect that they should apply more so, I'm not arguing stick with one measure or another. I think we are in complete agreement. Where I am just making the distinction as for example the affirmation ahh… scale. If you look it, if I change the word in the item ah… that you could not distinguish it from private regard or from other racial identity measures and so that distinction just because you use ah… one’s ethnic group doesn’t mean that you’re measuring something different and that’s where I, I would go a slightly different description. 

01:02:40
(inaudible ) 

01:02:42
I… I just want to first thank you for putting in together the panel as a student, who has studied racial identity. You guys are my rock stars and(ph) so to have you all on the thing panel is pretty awesome. Ah, along… in addition to that I wanted to ask Dr. Cross you referenced Dr. Quintana's work, a study about Chicano children and them being socialized and that being a better approach than socialize them in terms of discrimination and you and when you reference the ship you said that they were then racialized. So being talking about discrimination you can’t trace that is being racialized versus being socialized than one’s culture. Is that… is that accurate? So I’m wondering from your perspective, if the use of race and isolation of culture is a reduction in some way, whereas being cultured or being rooted in one’s culture is more I guess a complex representation of one’s group, one’s group membership, one’s group experiences, where race then reduces someone to a category and I wondering if you… if you are making that distinction. And my… my second question, which is not necessarily related is whether you are equating racial identity with racial ideology. Thank you. 

01:04:00
WILLIAM CROSS I would… I know the history of the writing, but I would say that it's not really racial ideology, it's a racial cultural ideology. Ahh… I’m, I'm trying to say that again taking the point of view of identity. Ahh… Parents don’t raise you to be racial over here and cultural over here, okay. They have a way, they don’t call it (inaudible ) but bring them… bring them together. And what I used, I think I’m understanding what you’re saying. When I used the examples in my multicultural class when the kids are coming in and marching in with they see race is physicality, that’s it. And then I say, well help me to understand the war between the (inaudible ) okay, okay that you're of(ph) what, okay. And they started their war as an ethnic war. So well, I’m not so sure I would go with them because if you analyze the relic(ph), the ideology of war between them it seem to be they had racialized ethnicity. Help me to understand how a person who was white, the German can in a sense be part of the holocaust, okay. They are… they are both white. So in the sense the person and how he was able to racialize cultural and religion. So that is, it is those… I don’t mean to be more of it, okay. But as those exemplars that can bring you back to the notion of how as it at the (inaudible ) experience of just everyday life of people may bring them together, because in a sense that people and power categorize certain groups and they… they don’t just simply have a racial history, okay. So in a sense, my memory of the south side Chicago which they flirt with wake… waking over lunch, okay. It was my sister playing Miles Davis in the next room, I didn’t know what was happening but she was enculturating me to what, the jazz. And at… at a later time, I would read about Miles Davis coming out of the 52nd street place, where he is playing music and he just steps out for a cigarette and is as I speaking (inaudible ), you with me. So… so all those kind of neat ways of separating them out began to be fused. And in identity, the focus is not on white, it's not on the target. They may have a sense of my being a beast. They may have a sense of my whatever, but I am living it… in a sense that’s my dilemma. I live in (inaudible ) sense where someone outside of me sees me as less than human. Even while I’m experiencing my humanity, okay. And how do I experience my humanity, because I don’t internalize your definition, but I understand it and I try to negotiate it with what do my cultural beingness and that’s the dilemma I think we have. Did I answered the question? 

01:06:50
Yes. 

01:06:50
I think some… 

01:06:50
Yes mam? 

01:06:55
ALEXANDRA Hello, ahh my name is Alexandra from NYU. I always had a difficult time, I had to write down the question, because it's a long question. Ah… I've always had a difficult time in understanding my own personal identity. Who am I? Ah… I was born in a different country, I came here at a young age and when I would go back to my home country, I would always find it difficult to fit in. I was always the American and here I was always the immigrant. As I grew older, I rejected my parent's religion, I rejected my parent's culture and I found my own through ah… groups that I felt comfortable with. And I wanted to know, how do we approach ah, the minorities that rejected their parent's ethnicity and cultural identity ah… in terms of huh… sorry, how do we approach these minorities that reject their parent's culture and ethnic and racial identity ah, when filling out questionnaires that force them or force them to label themselves African-American, Asian etc. Ah… and we as the people, the government or whomever makes that questionnaires that ask, how do you identity yourself, are we putting these labels, are we forcing these labels upon others. Ah, especially the youth that ah… we are around so I hope, that’s a clear question, I don’t know if that is. Thank you. 

01:08:45
STEPHEN QUINTANA Ah, what I think about and what I’m always impressed by to the interviews in life stories and so forth is really the tremendous creativity that people find and trying to find a place for themselves in this world, where there are categories and many people don’t fit within those categories. And so I recall a story about an anecdote, where some an African-American brothers were adopted by a Jewish family and they were raised within Judaism, but they always found when going to a synagogue that they really didn’t have a group with which they could identify. But what… they went to college and then they found the Ethiopian Jews and they even though you know, ancestrally they had nothing that they'd connected to Ethiopia that they finally found a place where they were a part of that group. And so I… I am continued to be impressed by the importance of being able to identify with the group, find a group with which you can identify with and to have some connections within that and I think those youth who… who aren’t able to fit into that struggle a great deal and that’s why they may be turn to some other kinds of subcultures to be able to find a sense of place in home for themselves. So I guess, I empathize with what you’re describing in the challenges that opposes. But there is a lot of creativity in terms of how they do solve that those dilemmas. 

01:10:05
TIFFANY YIP I think what you… what you talk about is very interesting, because when we… when we think about identity and when we measure identity we think about it as a sense of affirmation. I am blah… blah… blah… and when you do the maim(ph), one of the first questions is I am blank and you fill that out. But what you’re talking about is something different, which is I’m not blank, right. But that’s also identity, it's not affirmation, but it’s part of the identity process, it's part of developing a sense of self. Is… is… is the part of you know, the positive affirmation as well as I am not and we all go through the I’m not blank, right. It may not be related to race ethnics, the culture maybe relate it to religion or gender or professional identity or whatever it is, but it’s also part of identity development, but I don’t think that we measure that and I don’t think that we talk about it, but I do think it's part of the developmental process. 

01:11:00
[sil.] 

01:11:05
ROBERT SELLERS I guess I would also echo that and agreed I think one of the things that was particularly salient in both Tiffany and Steve’s response is remembering that often time when we look at ah… ah… ethnic minority groups, we forget that they are human. That their aspects of each and every one of us that is completely unique and their aspects of each and every one of us that is completely common and as you break those down. And what I believe to be a somewhat human ah… ah… ah… imperative is the need to ah… define oneself ah… and figure out who one is. Ahh, and sometimes that is done for you and your (inaudible ) and… and sometimes you do it ah… ah… and sometimes it’s a combination of those. And that it's also important to recognize that that no matter the most highly identified whether it's central, sally however words you want to use ah… ethnic identity person has a multitude of different identities and I think it's also important that we distinguish between the self or who that individual is and identities that they are from my perspective are a mentee(ph) many different identities that are often not as clean as the way that we tend to study them that often or dynamic in changing overtime and interplay with them but the individual is more than just the some of those identities and itself is more than just ah… those pieces in Bill’s work in terms of distinguishing between ah… ah… group identities that have been historically stigmatized in understanding that people are… are can be a member of “stigmatized” group and be completely and totally healthy and happy or be completely identified with a particular group and be sick as I don’t what, and that their distinctions that need to be made. But too often ah… the literature has defined us in ways that ah… puts issues of identity ah… ah… as if that’s the aspect that’s all who we are, that’s the totality of who we are and in some ways replaces our humanity.

DASARI SERVANTIS (ph) Hello, I’m Dasari Servantis(ph) from San Antonio, Texas at the University of the Incarnate Word and I’m lucky and privilege enough to grow up in a community that is very diverse and I myself, I'm Italian, Spanish, Mexican and Native American and grew up with pieces of those cultures all intertwined and never really felt like I was a race or saw, I was taught to see things in black and white, you know brown, orange or blue. So, until I went and lived in a different location it was first time I actually experienced racism or you know, feeling stereotyped and I never have particularly identified myself with one race or one culture. So my question is do you think that the more we become educated and the more we become more diverse and multicultural that race and culture will eventually just blurred to a point, where identity is the main focus and the main core principle and not so much of where you’re from and what language you speak and you know, what you believe? Thank you. 

01:15:10
Hah…hah…hah… 

01:15:10
TIFFANY YIP It's a great question. 

01:15:15
WILLIAM CROSS I'll be aggressive that you're not taking about you as a person okay. 

01:15:20
Hah…hah…hah… 

01:15:25
WILLIAM CROSS One of the problems of being a psychologist is that we’re constantly focus on such outcomes as mental health okay. When if you study person’s who have, I would say different frames of reference, these are the, their social identities and study the art sorry the creation of writing of novels okay. If, if I in a sense involve a identity I meant not that it won't be (inaudible ) but I do not allow it to be fed whatsoever, either by my intersectional identity or by my Africanity whatever. I’m not likely to produce works of art that will voice the groups experience which is not always negative okay. So, so in a sense one should yes we should deal with meantal health and so on, but how did David Levering Lewis go about writing two books on W.E.B DuBois taking almost 10 years of his life. How does Mori Evans(ph) roll out of bed hear the cacophony of the street and may be a burden between and write a poem. But not just a poem, a black poem. You know how does the Native American in the Dakotas, in a sense hear certain kinds of constellations of notes and you get I think you get my drift, I am not very good of being creative. 

01:16:50
Ha…ha…ha… 

01:16:50
WILLIAM CROSS So that identity no matter where people are, be they in China, be they in Africa. Those persons who are not overly acculturated, who are not assimilated, that those are human being too okay. But the persons who tend to produces products, social products, novels, literature and so on often engage who they are and then of course this (inaudible ) whether or not they are musically inclined or direct poets. You get my drift then that results some products and then we study those individuated, culture-based products to see what universal messages do they contain. But here is the irony of art. Art can be very group specific, but address the humanity okay. In some ways you almost relish being able to understand the way in which music sounds differently in China, it sounds differently as jazz, but when you get into the creative process those persons are usually engaged with a specificity of their environment. Am I making sense here? So you have to watch the issue of being a psychologist. 

01:18:00
Hah…hah…hah… 

01:18:05
WILLIAM CROSS That James Jones is in the audience (inaudible ) pick on them so (inaudible ) yes holiday(ph) yes, I mean we have to grow beyond the boundaries of being a psychologist and seek how does identity shape our life beyond being good. I am as neurotic and say I've been so for 70 years okay, but that hasn’t kept me you know from expressing culture and so on and I know many of my friends we just worked with pace together right but it doesn’t keep us from being it what inspired by culture. If we look at hip-hop it started out as what as what a CNN(ph) a screeching, serene commentary on one position with me. But then it often expressed beyond certainly the serene commentary and you can’t hear it without moving and so on using (inaudible ) example on my part. So I like I am glad what you said what you said but go beyond the boundaries of what you said. It doesn’t have to be in a position. It doesn’t have to be a form of oppression. It can be a liberating, motivating force to cause you to see things, feel things, smell things like you’ve never done before. 

01:19:20
[sil.] 

01:19:25
(inaudible ) 

01:19:30
I was wondering if the panelist could comment a little bit about on, a little bit about the, the development of theory and where you think maybe you are going and where the field should go and also related to that your kind of feeling and also say your feeling about the context(ph) that are the focus um in a lot of psychology research and they tend to focus, there tends to be a focus on importance in our fact and I was wondering since I know your models are complex, how you think you know we should what you think about that and how we should incorporate more of the complexity in your models and more of the research that we see in I meant to be in journals? Thank you. 

01:20:20
[sil.] 

01:20:25
ROBERT SELLERS Ah…hmm… that’s a very good question. So one thing is I actually I do believe we need to become more complex in our thinking, in our models I’m trying to capture particularly I guess in our measurement to try to capture the richness of the ideas some of the ideas that my panels have talked about that if you compare which I think one of our questions compared so by conceptualizations or operationalizations with our conceptualizations you’ll often find them ah…ah… a bit wanting and so coming up with ah… new ways and better ways to measure some the rich richness in these experiences I think is extremely important and doing so in ways such as capturing the dynamic nature of identity such that how does how is identity something that is very that that feels like it changes in some ways across situation but yet is also enduring and stable ah…such that you have a sense of individual differences. How do you capture the ways in which these things occur over longer periods of time in terms of development and how do people come to get different types of identities. We have almost no data on how identity changes beyond early adulthood at best ahh…basically college students, may be a couple of studies (inaudible ) folks in the 20’s and 30’s. But we have very little information about folks in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s and 70’s and how context in terms of historical context may play a role in this. And another thing that I I’ve been struggling with for 20 years is trying to capture the complexity within individuals of particular identities. So for some people who think about race all the time for whom race maybe important they may have much more complex notions about what that actually means then someone else who may also think that race is very important to them but their notions are somewhat simplistic. So whether you think of it from schema individualization ahh…perspective or some other perspective trying to capture, which sometimes looks like complete contradictions within individuals but still make perfect sense. Ah… I think that’s another area that ah…ah…I like and hope to go in future. 

01:23:30
STEPHEN QUINTANA Ah… one (inaudible ) I want to go out… with a certain developmental framework is that there is a zone of proximal development for children’s understanding of race and ethnicity and so. If I ask a 12th grader what does it mean to be your racial group? Ah… that 12th grader will typically give me response that a third grader could give me, but then I follow up that with other questions and sort of get into the mode of it if you well and then that 12th grader is much more capable of articulating a lot of the… you know things, other dimensions and dynamics associated with it. You know, in partly listening to ah… Bill Cross talk about the creative aspects of integrating race and sort of that awareness and consciousness and… and so forth. Is that ah… that there is a zone of proximal development that there is this… you know, sort of base response that we can all give related to race but that there this huge opportunity for some creativity and integration and synthesis as a part of it. So look ah… I’m looking into ways which we could promote that, so intergroup dialogue ah… kind of settings or I think one ways in which those ah… you could stretch people if you well in terms of their experience psychological experience in race and ethnicity. So sort of understanding how we can promote higher levels of thinking along those lines, but then also take advantage of the capabilities and abilities that are laid in somewhat and provided a chance to become manifest. 

01:24:50
TIFFANY YIP Um… a few things that I’d like to see happen in the future in this… in this area is um… really a better understanding of… of how identity develops for an individual. So we have models of um… identity development across time that map on to ego identity development commitment, search exploration. But… but what are those things mean like… what does that mean to search for one's identity, what does that mean to explore it? Like and if we talk about the lived experience, what is that? What does that look like? What does that feel like… and so we can talk about, oh I ask friends about race I talk to other people, I read books. But… but what’s the process, what’s the mechanism? I think that would be really important contribution to that field and to sort of seeing how these process is unfold over a time. Um… so I think that, that’s really important direction is… is really sort of a mapping the development on unfolding over a time and… and looking at into adulthood and… and… you know, what does identity it doesn’t stop, you know after 20's, 30’s and in fact, in those models talking about encounter, this is a life time process things happen, one gets married or he's(ph) being stuck in the family or these… these live events trigger identity processes. So how do we then you know, map that unfolding over a time. So I think that’s… that’s that would be very exciting and important direction for the field. 

01:26:25
WILLIAM CROSS Well, um… James Jones and Wade and myself were the old people here, okay. Um… when we first started out, ah… mainstream psychology dismissed the discourse on ethnicity and race. And so we were determined to show that… that was incorrect. And we turn it to rely on empirical database, ah… ah… ah… surveys and social experiments. I… I would hope that more people would it's not a either or situation but began to embrace a qualitative for your(ph) reference. Because some of the things that we’re talking about are best captured in the stream of consciousness of people. So for example more recently, ah… ah… my crew has been talking about, okay. How in the presence of a racial stagnancy at age 15, 16, 21 whatever, how does a person psychology protect himself, buffer themselves against ah… ah… a racial situation. It’s probably something that Bob said to his student yesterday; he says “That dilemma sometimes who being a graduate student is that these… the best statistician in the department has made me feel uncomfortable sometimes around blackness, are you with me? Okay. Yet, he or she is the best statistician. So how does my identity protect me to let through their expertise around stats, but at the same time buffer me when that person might do a micro aggression that I think is related to race, you with me? You know, how do we… how do we conceptualize that, how do we research that. (inaudible ) or how do we say your last name, wait a minute. I know some of the students in the audience seen others and Howard Stevenson at University of Pennsylvania had talked about researching, how do we better prepare our kids to be confident at what code switching. What is code switching? It's entering the mainstream, it's showing confidence in the mainstream situation and exiting the mainstream. We do this so fast, so we don’t think about it. Howard has been able to… Howard Stevenson that is, has been able to actually break those components down, if you got away, how do you teach it? And how do you not only teach the mechanisms. But how do you show students that just because you spend some of your time code switching doesn’t make you less ethnic in your blackness, okay. You know, and that’s a big deal, because the kids will push back and saying you're teaching me to be fonny(ph) to have a friend. So that's the kind of research I’d… I’d like us to do it doesn’t mean you can’t do it, with your paper, pencil or other survey techniques. But I think may be at the… at the earliest level ah… ah… what we’re trying to at least better describe this, I think we have to have stories about protection, stories about code switching. And I’ll… and then the thing that we often overlook, we are born into a group, we are assigned to the group. But that doesn’t make us black right away, it doesn’t make… it doesn’t bring on black friendship. So to cover friendships, what does it mean to be a member of a group, how… how does that take place, you know ah… not every person who was black as my friend, what are… how do I negotiate that stuff and still have a sense of attachment. So I’d like to see that kind of research will review identity as multidimensional it's having a rapporteur of contextually sensitive response in both mechanisms, and that within each of these categories one has to become confident, I had to become confident at buffering. I have to be confident at code switching. and I think that the kind of research would… would be powerful, and it would transcend group. Because in a sense, if I am Jewish I have to be sensitive to protecting myself against what, anti-Semitism, okay? If I’m gay, I had to be you get my drift. And of course if you want to have fun with that it's suppose I'm Jewish gay…. 

01:30:20
Ha… ha… ha… and black. 

01:30:20
WILLIAM CROSS But sometimes you got to start out with a single category is supposed to make sense. 

01:30:25
ELEANOR SEATON As the moderator where is Debbie, I’d like to add to that um… something I’d like to see… I’d like to see a connection more (inaudible ) historical events that is happening at the Macro Level and how that filters down to the Micro Level, I think about my parents and grew up doing Jim Crow in Mississippi and how one on the defining moments for them was the Civil Rights Act that was passed in the 60’s and they were in their mid 20’s and when they talk about the change between like Pre-Civil Rights Act and Post-Civil Rights Act. So, again historical events that we can't necessarily predict but could possible relate to a change at the very collective level which also filters down to the individual level. Now, I do not know how to assess that currently, but I’d like to see more research sort of connecting these Macro and Micro changes that affect, sort of groups of individuals and how they feel about their identity as they relate to being in a particular racial ethnic. Yes sir. Oh, yes mam! 

01:31:25
ANALY COTHEREZ (ph) Hi, ah… my name is Analy Cotherez(ph) and I am from UCLA. And one of my research interest is um… examining the effects of multicultural and color-blind ideology on evaluations of individuals who either come from or just come from the stereotypes that are associated with their ethnic group. And there are scholars as you know… or as you may know that um… content that color-blind ideology and encouraging individuals to assume a unifying identity would be a most effective approach to intergroup conflict. And there are other individuals who can turn to that multiculturalism and recognizing ethnic group differences would be the better approach to intergroup conflict. So I’m interested in getting your thoughts as to which approach maybe a most effective in reducing intergroup conflict or whether a hybrid of this two ideologies maybe more effective? 

01:32:25
STEPHEN QUINTANA I… I sometimes do teacher trainings and went (inaudible ) so the teachers are often very much interested in vested(ph) of a color-blind ah… ideology and approach. And what I point out and I don’t have update on it, but I'm pretty ah… confident about is that I think the color-blind approach really does encourage discrimination to occur. Because what happens early in childhood is that the children are told that everyone is the same that we’re all the same for that. And then as the children get be second, third grade they realize that the world is not the same one. When they’re going to certain neighborhood… some people don’t have the same things they're going on. So then they have to reconcile themselves for something that’s been ingrained with them is that we’re all equal, and then some people aren’t equal and then it base a question why are they not equal? And so in the… interviews that I have done they usually site things like well it must be something that they did to cause their poverty for that. And so ah… if the color-blind approach, I think has an ironic effect of really encouraging discrimination particularly for young children who are… who are coming into understanding the way that the world works for that. So ah… that’s where I am on… on that debate. Ha ha. 

01:33:40
ROBERT SELLERS Well, I have to answer this in two parts. So one part would be ah… hold off my personal ah… believes and how I would raise my kid ah… from a research perspective, I think there… to answer specifically your question about intergroup relations and I’m assuming color-blind in ah… the case of ah… the person of color ideology. Ah… I wish this wasn't so, but there is likely to be easier to have ah… ah… friends and interact with people of ah… other colors particularly of ah… whites if you have a color-blinds as that, a color-blind ideology. Ah… that it will be easier to feel comfortable in those particular ah… context at least that would be consistent and… and to the extent to which you don’t experience more belaten(ph) forms of discrimination because part of the micro regressions assumes that you’re able… that you um… have a make a particular appraisal as to why you're treated this way. And so being color-blind you may be more likely to attribute your unfair treatment to many other things and in those context as a result you’ll experience fewer micro regressions and therefore feel less stress to settle in that particular context. However, you become vulnerable I, ah… our data suggest, ah… when you actually do ah… experience something for which you cannot make a different kind of attribution and therefore that the whole notion of believing the world is fair ah… that this can’t happen we’ve gone past ah… ah… races et cetera… puts you at tremendous risk. Because you now not only have to deal with ah… that particular micro regression in that particular incident… instance, but you also have to do with what we know in trauma. So that you have flashbacks and have to go backs and have to go back to all the other instances that you might have been um… ah… ah… ah… for that we've got a word stupid ah… and it… it enforces you to read you know, in a way that can be very traumatic. So um… if everything were fair and wonderful and there was really no ah… races and no discrimination then, at that point that might make sense. Um… but since ah… every ah… everything that I know including every (inaudible ) suggest that we’re not at that ah… place, then you’re at a great ah… risk and ah… the thing that… that is kinda interesting to me is I wonder if we ever actually got to that place, then what I actually know it. Um… ah… and ah… ah… and in some ways and this is gonna sound a little bit, but I actually want to be given how much from ah… what we talked about early in terms of this meaning making and how I see myself and you know how, much is invested in understanding that this place is inferior. Um… could I exist in that ah… world? But since I don’t… I don’t… I don’t think there is any chance in my lifetime that that’s gotta… gotta happen, and that’s optimistic or pessimistic. 

01:37:15
TIFFANY YIP I think this actually relates back to an earlier question about, you know whatever be obsolete to study racial ethnic differences right. Are the race of inter-marriage and so forth and not that… that… one day we won’t be studying these things. And… and… may be… may be… I don’t know but I think if we ever got to that point and this is similar to ideal color blindness there would be other things that people would distinguish each other. And I think like probably saying it's human nature to just distinguish things that helps us make sense of our world that helps not to have steps overload in stimulation, right. We just categorize things naturally it’s the meaning that we attach to this categories let them become problematic, but I think categories will always exist. So, if it’s not around race, culture, ethnicity it’s gonna be around class or it’s gonna be around where people live or… or some other aspect that allows us just distinguish other people. So I think, you know colorblind idealistically maybe it’s great, maybe it’s not I don’t know, but if not color then something else I think what would that distinguish people. 

01:38:25
WILLIAM CROSS Ah… for those interested write down this name, Kristal Perkins spell with a k… she just has completed a dissertation at the graduate center, and what she use Helen Neville’s color blindness attitude scale. Ah… scales from Bob’s measure and my own. And to briefly summarize, she found that people who are humanist, simulated, who were more likely adhere to a color-blind perspective, and to have the view that the system as a whole was in no need of change. 

01:39:10
[sil.] 

01:39:15
WILLIAM CROSS Color blindness as used as an ideology by those who are intentional is a way in which to shield a discourse on difference whether it would be social class, cultural, integration whatever. Because in a sense, if you say everybody is the same, you're really saying that I can have an explanation of behavior based on a single system. Well, what’s the single system? It tends to be the status quo, you with me. So she was showing in a sense and going right to what Bob said early on it's… it's not just having, a racial… racial cultural attitude because that tends to make us think as one thing. But there is a range of racial cultural attitudes and there are some, they are not dangerous in the sense that you have the right as an American to believe as you what. But the more you’re likely um… now I am getting political, okay. And you’re a person of color or you are a white person and you… your goal, you think is to be an ally. And the more you embrace a color-blind perspective, less likely you’re to be of confidence in helping with the kinds of issues that groups are facing when difference is real for them. Ah… Sedanious(ph), Sedanious(ph)? Yep… he has shown again that people who tend… tend to have all respect to Republicans and whatever Conservatives in the audience. But if you tend to have a Conservative frame and you embrace a color-blind perspective, you tend to be somewhat impatient with discussions of difference. You might even suggest that people who are different make things different by talking about their difference. 

01:41:10
Ha… ha… ha… 

01:41:10
WILLIAM CROSS So color blind and… and I remind you historically, you know shut up, okay. That in… the mid 1960’s, there were something called the Coleman Report. Do you remember that? And if you don’t you should, especially if you are in education. And he was suggesting among other things that the best strategy for school teachers is to not talk about race, is to not talk about difference. And we have a history of teachers, well mean not talking about race. Many of your professors who have produced you and well meaning have been awkward talking about race when you bring it up, okay. And they are more frigging comfortable, when you talk about variables that had nothing to do with culture. And some have told you, you can have a better career if you don’t you get (inaudible ). So there is an irony the color blindness sounds like it something we should aspire to. I think the issue becomes can we in a sense be very explicit about what makes a black person uncomfortable, what do we mean by micro aggressions? What do we mean by you know, there was… and then be very explicit about that and then as allies or members of the same group or different groups, how do we create environments where there is an absence of this micro aggressions? But the absence of micro aggressions doesn’t require that we be the same… that we be the same. Those are two different issues, what causes people pain(ph) is not so much make difference but the way people and power act on my difference. And so, it’s… it’s a very powerful thing and Krystal is one of the first studies that I’m aware of what she has used these the measures that we tend to be enumerate(ph) with and actually showing that certain frames of reference are enumerate(ph) with the stance. And those frames or reference are tend to be held by people, who don’t want to join together with other Chicanos with other African-Americans to what solve certain issues, celebrate certain culture and so on. That doesn’t make that bad okay, because they are members of the boy scout, they are members of whatever, they… they have an identity. But it is not gear toward in a sense addressing certain kinds of issues that this kind of form is trying to address very explicitly… explicitly. 

01:43:30
We have time for two more questions! Yes sir. 

01:43:35

01:43:40
JOHN BLOWSKY (ph) Hi, I’m John Blowsky(ph) from San Antonio and I have to say, I’m more confused now than when I walked into the room. 

01:43:45
TIFFANY YIP Ha… ha… ha… 

01:43:50
ROBERT SELLERS We did our job… 

01:43:50
STEPHEN QUINTANA Yeah. 

01:43:50
WILLIAM CROS Did our job… 

01:43:50
ROBERT SELLERS Job well done. 

01:43:55
JOHN BLOWSKY (ph) So maybe you’ve succeeded. 

01:44:00
TIFFANY YIP Ha… ha… ha… 

01:44:00
Ha… ha… ha… 

01:44:00
JOHN BLOWSKY (ph) But it make you… I think that maybe we need a paradigm shift here. Um… that race was a term created long time ago and perhaps for the wrong reasons. But we still use it and we may be inadvertently continuing some of that same discourse that we shouldn’t go there anymore. And that culture now has become the American culture. Though that, you know the confluence of history, that has brought a set off behaviors and believes about what it means to be normal or the reference group to… to be like. And that ethnicity is really what you’re talking about which is what we live and that… there as many ethnicities as there are people in this room. And that those the ethnicities were different five years ago, and that'll be different again five years from now. And I think this is where psychology can really contribute to this whole discourse, because we’re good at measuring individual differences. And perhaps you know leave race behind and look at it more in terms of attention between culture and ethnicity. And that’s where the identity is shaped all along and it’s, it’s a moving object. It’s a, it’s a hard target to get to and I'll leave it up to you to figure out how to measure that. 

01:45:25
Thank you. 

01:45:30

01:45:35
WILLIAM CROSS I live in Las Vegas. African Americans make a 10% of the population, they make up 55% of persons who are being adjudicated. It turns out that most of those persons who were being adjudicated are not black men and women, but black males, the only way I can address that is to, with that reality hit me front and center. I’m 70, but I think even if I was 20, I think it’s going to take us a long time for us to get beyond race and I think one of the dedications of what Bob has done here to be congratulated as there have to be moments when we just deal front and center with this. In my own community, if you are a male, and you’re a gay, there are still certain churches in my community that silence those voices, are you with me? In the sense, I understand what you’re saying and I would love to be your friend, because I probably could be your friend if you give my (inaudible ) so on, so on in the sense you, you, you’re, you’re identity allows some prosiness(ph), but don’t that we’re, we’re saying over and over again, race is oppression but also race can be culture. And just because culture can be fun, don’t allow that to seduce you and forget about race as a problem. But even after the problem is gone, those of you who are working in colleges, they are conflicts arising on your campuses in a sense they’re often between African Americans and people from the continent. And it has nothing to do with, race has to do with the, the way in which cultural differences come together and they clash. So, whether its race, whether its culture, we just should not be afraid of conflict and I understand the spirit of what you said or I reject it openly, and just tell you you’re wrong in the sense if you are to be in ally for the members of the groups in here, you’re not only want to get up close to the comfortable blanket that we offer you in our diversity, but you have to show some stuff that you can hear the problems that we face and if you are really in in ally you will dig in and you will dig in and that doesn’t mean you will be bad, but you’re, you get closure to that part which is pain, which is pain that 55% were being adjudicated. We need you, so I hope you make a journey. 

01:48:15
Yes ma’am. 

01:48:15
Now, and answering this last question, I’ll ask our panel also to include any concluding remarks for this plenary session. Go ahead. 

01:48:30
Alright. Uhmm, in my consumption of academic literature and just mass media in general, I often find that message is that to be racial and that to be ethnic is to be a minority with the implicit assumption being that to be white as to be cultureless. So, I’m just really interested in hearing your thoughts about white identity or white privilege and its influence on how we a psychology, psychologist have conceptualized ethnic identify involvement in general. 

01:49:00
[sil.] 

01:49:05
ROBERT SELLERS Uhmm, okay. I don’t study white identity and I think it’s okay. And the reason why, is because I’m interested in African Americans experiences and so white identity is in the part of it and I’m not trying to develop an understanding of those identity puzzle, doesn’t mean that what I have to say wouldn't necessarily be relevant to them just as ahh, ahh much of what I’ve learned in psychology which has been based on other people, ah may still have some insight into my understanding of African Americans because their expects are similar. But I think it is important to understand and you bring out a couple of really, really important points in your question. In that’s, the first and foremost is this notion, a point of view that to understand identity, you have to understand the notion, a point of view in particularly as relates in psychology. And again the transformative experience of mine in studying racial identity was reading those shapes black. And his work was one of the, his opening couple of chapters, it’s one of the, the best purest examples of showing point of view that if you don’t take into the context the way in which questions around low self-esteem get played out and by who is asking them, it doesn’t make sense. If you for example low self-esteem in African Americans, if you'd ask most African Americans and probably most of your, your own group about whatever pathology side, mainstream psychology is laid upon us would make sense based on how you would describe who you are. It only make sense, so when we start talking about stigma and the idea oh well, the stigmatized groups and you think about the stigmata and this poor cut on the face and I look at this person and I feel really sorry for them. So, even if I’m a very positive person and I want to empathize, I feel sorry for them they're automatically a victim. And from that, I draw all kinds of meaning and implications above them as victimized individuals whether its victim of racism or stigma or victims of having that cut and assume not about anything else about who they are as humans, but all that you think about them is, is the way that we think their different is because of that cut. And what I think it must be like to have that cut from the perspective of where I am. So, who it must be really, really bad to have a cut because I don’t have that cut and I’m looking and any kinds that scares me. But you might not understand that, that cut maybe something for the meaning of that individual is something of great pride and a great source of pride, might have got that cut, saving somebody, that cut might be, might be as BS(ph) detector. So, I don’t have to deal with BS(ph) because as soon as I see the people (inaudible ) from this gives me all this you know very positive things, but from the point of view of the outsider looking at for cut, so when you look at much of the way in which mainstream psychology has looked at us, it has been from the point of view of how they are different and usually that how they are different is from how they’re deficit and then we’re trying to explain only the difference and leave out the humanity. And so, when I think about ways in which uhmm, uhmm, uhhh I think about how we’re viewed and how we view ourselves, it’s very important that we throw off the bondage of looking from the outside end. And you will get uhmm uhmm, hammered for doing "me"(ph) researching. You’re not objective in looking at in some way, but and again Bill, you did that, I thought another could have…. If you look at all of the "mainstream" ahh…ahh… theorists on whether its identity or (inaudible ) etc. All these ideas are based on my view of the world. That’s all theorizing years as how I experienced the world and I’m going to then assume that this is the way of the rest of world feels. And so, and then they get, though…though those theories get apply to us and when we do that or we are discouraged from doing that which if we follow that, will lead us down a very dark and dangerous path and that we will continue to perpetuate and inhumane and incomplete vision of ourselves based on at outside point of view. And in doing so, we also will impoverish psychology in general. Because if psychology is really the study of human behavior and human experiences, then it should be of all human behavior and all human experiences and so when somebody asks you about how you're studying your particular group and you’re too limited, and you need to be a more broader perspective, you should feel quite comfortable and say no, I’m actually broadening the perspective. And one last, one, one last point, so every single article that I’ve published on racial identity in that title, has African Americans and usually whether its college students or, or etc. Now, and, and if you look at most other things that you study, there is not that qualifying and yet that sample is every bit as "narrow" as the one that they were proposing. And so, when you think about the point of view and how your work fits in that broader notion of psychology, it doesn’t have to necessarily be umm adversarial or "political", I would argue doing this, is what good science is really suppose to be about in broadening, in generalize and trying to understand the experiences of those folks. So, I'll shut up now. 

01:56:25
Who is the woman, who is the woman you said that? I want you to stand up and don't you…. Alright, I want to see you. 

01:56:40
WILLIAM CROSS I’m not saying you are white, but you said, you are right. 

01:56:40
No. 

01:56:40
No. 

01:56:40
Oh, who said? 

01:56:45
WILLIAM CROSS Okay, good whatever. You talked about, you talked about white identity right? 

01:56:50
Well, I wanted to know just give your thought about like white (inaudible ) . 

01:56:55
yeah. 

01:56:55
WILLIAM CROSS Yeah. I use to, okay, please sit down. To all my colleague and at your interest as well, but also the white in the audience, you should understand that none of us would have received Ph.D. if we did not have whites in the committee. If we do not have whites who struggled to, sometime struggle to get us into the department who found the way to silence the idiots in our departments and makes space for us without necessarily getting into too much political problems with the powerful idiots who could make us, are you with, are you with me? Okay. Now, I’m gonna go beyond that and go into your agenda, whiteness is a social construction is the result for socialization. And therefore, it should be studied in the same way of we are studying issue of ethnicity as well. People like (inaudible ) who is now moving to (inaudible ) I think Michelle(ph) find there is a rich literature out there. We absolutely need allies, but we don’t need idiots. We need people who have taken the time and gone through the forging pain because when you do this, if you do this and if you are at Wyoming and if you are at university, wherever, there will be other whites on your, in your program who are wondering why are you doing this? So, there is a way in which you can be an ally to make sure that we get into your institutions, not in some kind of special way, but when we are there, when we qualify and we should be let in that we do good in… you know find the way to get 10 years or so you could be powerful in the sense and also be part of that, make be an ally for us. There is a literature that you need to I mean that there is research that you need to do, and I will shut up and would follow on. We're just studying to try to figure out how do whites develop their frame of reference and all we did was studying the kinds of dolls that whites buy for their children, are you with me? And we discovered that in black homes, they were likely to purchase for every black doll they have to purchase, they are going to purchase a white doll because what they wanted to communicate to their children is that the world consisted of what difference, but with regard to our sample of white mothers who were nice, whatever, they were fine, but hardly any, any representations of color in the dolls they purchased, in the books they purchased and so on, no surprise, therefore when they, those kids probably got to be teenyboppers that you know what’s the issue must be color blind. That’s what color blind looks like when you socialize something. You socialize to the extent that you exist; you don’t really get recognition to your existence and then you brought out difference. So, there is much research to be done, there is already stuff out there, that’s powerful. Ahh, it’s gonna (inaudible ) Michelle(ph) fine because she just thinks she is so fantastic as exemplary. But if you turn to Michelle’s work even right her, she would turn you and she’s got kids who were in fact going to white schools asking white kids who are taking, A, B classes, how do they feel about the fact that they are so few minorities in those A, B classes. How do they think that happens? No, she didn’t turn on and make everybody radical but it was that kind of research if you will you know how do white males and primarily you know how do they feel in certain kind of situations. And it is from that kind of research that you can produce if you will, a more rich texture white identity in this course. And so, we've lot to be done and we hope we're doing and we hope maybe two or three years, maybe next year, there is a module of papers on that kind of research. 

02:00:45
Concluding remarks? 

02:00:50

02:00:55
TIFFANY YIP Ahh, someone commented that they're more confused now than they were two hours ago and I think that’s great. I think that’s fine because I don’t think the panel was, was put together to, for us to give answers. We don’t have the answer. I think it was meant to sort of stimulate discussion anything about future directions and so you know we are not done. We don’t have the answers and, and it’s okay to move forward questions and, and I think that’s part of way we can (inaudible ) first place was to think about you know where and the importance and direction we can go in and sort of to keep, keep the conversation going and the sort of and, and, and I find it very exciting. I think it’s very exciting to think about these questions and the sort of push the field forward. So, so I encourage people to do that. 

02:01:45
WILLIAM CROSS Just to reiterate, this is an exciting time. We had to find ways to legitimize our research and we did, but nonetheless even for us, it is just easier for us to do this work. It just something or accident that Bob was able to organize this, this, not this panel, but this conference. It’s a mark to the extent that most of the groups that are here have found the way proactively to impact APA and I think, I think you as youth and I think the panel. And by the way, we, we, we stake invigorated by the way in which you come to us and say you disagree or you want to add this piece. It is such an honor to be old and to be around young people. 

02:02:30
[sil.] 

02:02:35
STEPHEN QUINTANA Ahh, just to reflect a little bit, I think what’s been happening here is having a very nice honest dialogue that really appreciates the complexity of this and it’s in, even if these things are complex, it’s hard to sort of wrap here (inaudible ) some it’s still does not make those issues go away so that we can still ask this very hard probing questions, give very honestly answers to these things and I think that’s what really move us forward on this. So, I have appreciated the opportunity to be here and look forward to the things that happen after this. 

02:03:05
ROBERT SELLERS Uhmm, I would also derive(ph) those comments. I really appreciate the opportunities whenever they come up to dialogue with the folks of the panel and the audience, I also share Bill’s, optimism or its not, it's more than optimism. It’s a sense of where the field is heading and how many new folks come up with great ideas and even though, I’m a little bit younger that I can see where the field has gone and where it is going in many ways as unbelievably exciting and invigorating and inspiring and I just hope that the, the, the conversation today, I was just sitting here and thinking I can’t wait to, to look back 20 years from now and (inaudible ) to any audience and seeing a panel like this and seeing where we are and where we are going because, again I think it’s, the future is quite bright and I’m just glad to have this opportunity. 

02:04:20
Please join me and given our panelist a standing ovation.
