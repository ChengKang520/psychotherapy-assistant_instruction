JEFFREY ZEIG Well, thanks so much for being here in general, and certainly thanks so much for being here at the end of the conference for the closing keynote and perhaps the closing remarks. The kind of tradition we have is to give the people, especially the faculty, but also attendees an opportunity to come to the mic at the closing remarks. Especially important for those of you who really like closure. And uh.

Beethoven and Erickson Jeffrey Zeig, Ph.D. 

00:00:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And my topic today for uh, uh, keynote is about Beethoven and Erickson. And this is the second time I give this speech. It was really the prompting of Bernhard Trenkle who is on our Board of Directors who is organizing the ISH Conference, International Society of Hypnosis, uh, next year, and uh, I have been developing this theme and I offer it to you as a way of really understanding more about Milton Erickson. And what we are interested in is codes of impact. And there are codes of impact that are implicit. And when it comes to the impact it reaches the heart. These codes are implicit. Information. Impact. What we know. What we realize. And there needs to be a bridge between the land of knowing and the land of realizing. We know to eat well, we know to be kind in relationships, we know that we can change our mood if we are stuck in moods. Do we necessarily realize what we know. How do we help people to create that bridge? Well you can't bridge between the land of knowing and the land of realizing with information. You need to do that though an experiential impact. If we want to understand experiential impact, we need to go to the people who are masters at experiential impact. And certainly Erickson was a master at experiential impact. And certainly Beethoven was a master at experiential impact. So we are going to compare and contrast some of the codes of impact that Beethoven used to the codes of impact that Milton Erickson used and, well, we are going to find out that they are very similar and that the, uh, way in which Erickson structured an induction, the way in which Erickson structured his therapy, the way in which Erickson structured his communication had to do with themes that are very similar to Beethoven, any composer, but not any composer, any artist, any artist of any ilk being that of a literary form or uh, uh, choreography, or even architecture. So Beethoven said that art demands that we shall not stand still. And although Erickson didn't say it, it was implicit in his work that psychotherapy demands that we shall not stand still and that Ericksonian therapy even 31 years after Dr. Erickson's death needs to continue to evolve. So both Bateson and Erickson worked deciduously to have impact, and there are decided similarities in the codes that they used. And these codes of impact across, uh, divergent disciplines. So music is going to be our primary metaphor, but it's just, it's just a metaphor because these codes are implicit across art. And we are going to look at music from its implicit structure. Now what I'm doing should be illegal. It really should be illegal to look at music from its, from studying its implicit structure unless you are a composer because well, there is a difference between heaven and hell. Do you know the difference between heaven and hell? In heaven they tell jokes. In hell they explain them. So when we look at the implicit structure we are explaining. And, uh, so the purpose of these, of the presentation is to have another model to understand Erickson. And, uh, understand Erickson from the perspective of art. And to understand something about hypnosis. Something that's really inherent to hypnosis. And one thing that is inherent to hypnosis is that the hypnotic impact is implicitly embedded in the weave of the communication, and it's the unexamined elaboration in communication that impacts people to change their state. Now you'll see that I put this concepts of states in quotation marks because states are kind of, you know, squirrely. They are difficult to define. We know when we've changed our state. We feel it. We experience it. But it's very hard for us to describe in even qualitative terms. So the story began with modeling and trying to model Milton Erickson. And modeling is probably the best part of neurolinguistic programming. And modeling, if you'd just look at me for a minute, modeling is like you look around the world and you find something that's excellent. And then what you do is you do this, meaning that you move it closer. And then what you do is you do this, meaning that you chunk it down. And then what you do is you do this. You try on these chunks. Now I'm excellent. And I really think that is the best part of NLP. So trying to model Erickson was one of the tasks that NLP set for itself and now what I decided to do was to look around the universe and there's art with a big A. And to take art and to model things from art and to bring things from art back into psychotherapy, back into hypnosis as a way of trying to really live more excellently when I'm doing hypnosis and psychotherapy. So this is me in 1973 when I met Milton Erickson. I look the same, right? I can't even tell you how many times Roxie tried to take pictures in those early years so that I could finally get a good picture with Dr. Erickson. And so there he was wearing purple in his wheelchair highly infirmed. Vision doubled. Hearing impaired. Breathing by virtue of a half a diaphragm and a few intercostal muscles. His vision was double. He was in constant chronic pain, and he was laughing all of the time. He could hardly use his legs. When I met him he could push himself off of his wheelchair, support himself on his legs for a minute, and flop himself into his office chair. But within a year or two he had to stay in the wheelchair. He just didn't have the strength anymore. And he just perfumed the atmosphere with being glad to be alive. And if you came to Erickson with limitations, well, he had more limitations than you did. And if you came to Erickson with pain, well, he probably had more pain than you did. And he was laughing all the time. And when I came to see Erickson it was because I was an admiring student and I wanted the cognitive part. I wanted to learn how he did what he did and within an hour, maybe less of being there I just didn't care. I just wanted to be around him. I just wanted to see how he lived. I felt like I was with somebody who was mastering life before my eyes and it was just an amazing experience. I remember I was there the second day and tears running down my face. It was. I said congruently Dr. Erickson you are the most impressive human being I have ever met. And he said, "Jeff, I'm just another old bozo on the path of life." Cause he didn't want to be on a pedestal, even one that was made of marble. Uh-huh. And, uh, the story currently is about modeling art. And Alex Vesely who is here has helped me, and uh, he's made the trailer for this documentary that I've been working on, which is emotional- impact.com. And if you go you will see the beautiful trailer that Alex made, and you'll see what I've been doing as a project, which is meeting with artists, and I've been so blessed. I met with Academy Award winners, Presidential Art Medal winners, that's even better than the Academy Award. And it's amazing that if you have a camera crew and chutzpa you could interview a lot of people. And so I've interviewed Stan Lee of Marvel Comic Books trying to understand how he would set up a story. I interviewed, uh, Richard Sherman who wrote, uh, Mary Poppins. And if I say the second tune that he wrote, it will just make you crazy because you won't be able to get it out of your mind. Are you, are you willing to dare? He wrote, "It's a Small World After All". But if you want to see more about this project Modeling Art, emotional-impact.com. And, uh, the best way to understand our field. What is the best way to understand, not only to understand, but to advance psychotherapy. And I think the best way to do that is in the context of another. The people who have really advanced the field of psychotherapy have, yes, come from the inside but very often they've come from the outside. From communications. From anthropology. From linguistics. And they've been able to take our field to places where it hasn't been before by virtue of amalgamating ideas from another field. So I put myself in incredibly good company and that has nothing to do with narcissism. Well, maybe a little bit. Uh-huh. So, we could use the lens of anthropology as Bateson and Mead did to understand something about Erickson. We could use the approach, communications approach, Understanding Something About Hierarchies, the brilliant work of Haley and Madanes. (ph)Watchulik using a philosophical perspective. Constructivess lens to understand, uh, communication. Ernie using a neurobiological lens, his, uh, um, genetic, uh, approach. Banglor and Grindor using linguistics. And what I'm trying to offer is another lens. There are many lenses on the floor of the philosophical universe that can be used to understand the world and the lens that I am picking up has to do with art. And, uh, art is about expressive impact. So here we will take for a moment an exhibit that I saw of the great Spanish painter Joan Miro whose work is whimsical and wonderful. And he did something that was stunning. I was visiting New York, I was teaching in New York and I went to visit at the Museum of Modern Art, and I saw, uh, this exhibit of Joan Miro called Dutch Interiors. And what he did was to use the concept of mutation and metamorphosis as a way of understanding expressive elements. So he looked at the art of Jan Steen, one of the great Dutch artists who was probably very radical in his own time, and this was Jan Steen's painting. And it's called Dutch Interiors. And there were a number of paintings in Dutch Interiors that I'm sure compared to the religious art of his predecessors, but Jan Steen's art was really radical. And this is called Teaching A Cat How to Dance. So, there's these kind of drunken people at the tavern. The woman who's playing the, uh, I think that's an Irish tin whistle. No, no no. Forgive me. The woman who's playing the flute. The dog. And there's a person looking from the outside. Musical instrument. Pitcher. And the tablecloth. This child laughing raucously. And the person teaching the cat how to dance. And then Miro decided that he would repaint this painting taking out the information and making it into expressive components, ala Miro, and here's Miro's version. Now that's the same painting. Uh-huh. And, uh, you know, uh, here's the blue skirt and the person playing and there's the cat and there's the child laughing raucously and the musical instrument and the dog and really at the Museum of Modern Art they just pointed it out, uh, fragment by fragment of how Miro took the Jan Steen took out the information and made it purely expressive and that it would be the expressive function. Brilliant idea that he had. Radical idea that he had to take the information out and make it purely expressive so that you could feel, you could get the felt sense of what Jan Steen was trying to communicate in Miro's vision. I think it's beautiful. I have another idea. And, uh, this is for my wife, Lillian, who likes this anyway and I like it. And it's partly, uh, um, to understand even better. We will take a little extra excursion. And, uh, this is to understand excellence by virtue of understanding the elemental components. It's the embellishments. I tried to play this at the, um, workshop that I did on advance techniques of hypnosis where the purpose of that was to explain embellishments. But these are two sopranos. I hope that it works this time. And soprano number one is a trained singer. She's absolutely wonderful, and she's going to sing a cantata, like an aria from Rossini and she is going to sing exactly what Rossini wrote. So if you think about this you think about this is a hypnotic script, she's reading from the script, she is going to do it, and she's going to do it beautifully. The second soprano is going to sing the same thing, but she is going to sing what Rossini expected when somebody would sing this cantata from The Barber of Seville, which is embellishments. Now I'm not trained in bel canto opera and the second soprano is trained in bel canto opera and what I'd like you to do is get the felt sense of the difference. Here is a script. Here is art that's meant to really move your heart and it is being done through embellishments that we can't understand. So let's pray that this works. 

00:16:40
[music] 

00:16:45
JEFFREY ZEIG (crosstalk)Close your eyes and feel it. 

00:16:50
[music] 

00:18:20
JEFFREY ZEIG See, that's beautiful. Right? It's lovely and somehow we lost some of the high tones. You didn't change anything, Gary. No. And now, let's hear soprano number two. And she's going to sing the same thing, but she's going to add embellishments. And let's see that we can get the felt sense even though we'll never understand, unless you're trained in bel canto opera or, uh, uh, singing what the embellishments are and how this second excerpt takes excellence and takes it one step further. 

00:19:00
[music] 

00:21:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Stunning, huh? Now nobody added more embellishments to psychotherapy than Milton Erickson. And his communication was rich with embellishments. And even to this day people continue to try to look at what he did and understand the embellishments that he used and how he created impact by condensing his communication and adding as many embellishments as possible, which really creates the essential structure that moves peoples state that really creates the essential structure that makes trends possible. So because I wanted a sense of closure and I couldn't get that to play on the, uh, on the previous, uh, workshop I at least got it to play here. Okay. So music begins where language leaves off. Especially symphonic music. And, um, music takes language into another realm. Because music builds on the expressive aspects of communication in the way that language can't. And if we want to reach people through experiential communication, through expressive communication, I think it helps to understand something about the structure of music and the way in which music affects states. If you want to feel something upbeat, you may listen to upbeat music. If you want to feel something limitive, peaceful, you might listen to Vivaldi. And, uh, you know intuitively when you turn the radio on in your car that whatever station you tune in to is going to be instrumental in changing something about your state. And composers eliciting responses like Erickson, they do that through implication. Oh. I shouldn't have added this bad joke. So Beethoven is talking to his housekeeper and Beethoven says to his housekeeper, you've been an incredible influence on me. You have made a world of difference in my life. And the housekeeper says, me influence you? Ha, ha, ha ha. The only thing worse is what's Beethoven doing now? Decomposing. Okay. So Beethoven 1804 probably was not this handsome young man that was portrayed in his portrait. He was rather a pox-marked, small pox-marked, uh, like I think Mozart, and, um, kind of a difficult person and didn't lead a very happy life. And in spite of all of his infirmities, many of which were gastrointestinal, he could create some of the most beautiful music and he knew it. He knew his genius. And he knew that he was, uh, composing for posterity and he worked it. His sketch books and his letters indicated how much he worked. Haydn did 100 symphonies. Beethoven did nine. We remember Beethoven much more than we remember Haydn because he did so much work and it's not so much the brilliance but the fact that every structural element fits together with such remarkable refinement. Such remarkable precision. So we're going to look at Beethoven's Fifth. These are the two most famous notes in Western history, in Western music, or, uh, you know, the most famous tones. Four notes. And, uh, this is off the internet. A graphical score of the Fifth Symphony was presented after the Sixth in 1804 when Beethoven did an impossibly long program. It was one of the first times in which you could take, uh, music and you could have a composer presenting his own music and making it available to the public. So this is from the internet. Beethoven's Fifth visual structure. 

00:25:40
[music] 

00:27:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Beautiful. Uh-huh. And then just feel your way into it and what the affect that has on you if you allow that induction to reach your heart and then you allow that to really move you and to feel the sense of that. Well, that's the heaven part. Now the, um, making the implicit the explicit. How many implicit patterns of impact did Beethoven use? And I'm not in any way musically oriented. I am not a musical scholar. So let's think of the codes that Beethoven was using. Well one thing that Beethoven was doing was he was using jump into action. We started with the steam. Now you know from other classical music and perhaps listening to Chopin that there would be a long prelude that would lead the person into the music. Well what Beethoven did is he jumped into action. When Tolstoy wrote Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina, he jumped into action. When Melville wrote Moby Dick there was 400 pages before you got to the whale. Uh-huh. And when Tolstoy wrote Anna Karenina and jumped into action and 400 pages later you find out that Count Vronsky is bald, one of the main characters, you don't even realize anything about him until some of the structure until 400 pages later, and then you get the description. That was radical in literature. And this, I'm sure, was radical in, in music. And it was radical in Erickson because we looked at a video tape at the advanced workshop where immediately Erickson one minute into talking with a, a man started the hypnotic induction and jumped into action. And the idea was that therapy was going to be about impact. It's gonna be about having an experience through which you will be different. Now I don't know that Erickson was musically inclined at all because he reported being tone deaf. But he was literate. He read widely. And he knew the structure of the techniques that artists use I do believe. And I think that he modeled some of those structures and he would jump into action. Another thing that Beethoven did is that he initially, he started by increasing the tension. And when Erickson started the inductions of hypnosis he would start by increasing tension. He would say strange things to people. For example, tell me how you would like to go into a trance, quickly and easily, suddenly all at once just as if you had a broken leg or broken arm and wanted to lose that pain immediately? All right. Do so. Now. And he would start by increasing the tension and yet no hypnotist in history did that. Hypnosis has always been waaaaaaa. Kind of limitive and peaceful. But Erickson was more like Beethoven. Increase the tension. Beethoven's Fifth is about storytelling. The first movement, the first section that you heard was called the fate theme. Ba, ba, ba, baam. And it started with fate. And the story of the Fifth Symphony is that the C minor portion, I think it's E flat major portion or C major, I don't remember which one it is, but the, uh, the initial portion you remember. Ba, ba, ba, baam. The fate theme. But it's immediately followed by the next theme, which is hope. And the story of Beethoven's Fifth is that we start with fate but that hope wins out over fate and transcended for someone who was so really miserable in life. And then what Beethoven was doing was modulating the tension. He didn't allow us to just, mmmmmmmmmmmm, like a traditional hypnotist would do, he raised and lowered the tension. And this was shocking to me when Erickson explained it to me that when he did the induction of hypnosis he would modulate the level of tension. And he would increase, decrease the tension as he did his induction. And then in music there is a contrast, hard bar, soft bar, hard bar, soft bar, but we don't hear that. We just listen to the music. And then there's redundancy because there is repetition but even more than repetition there is recursions. And what Beethoven does with that ba, ba, ba, baam is he takes that through so many mutations and metamorphoses that he creates the whole symphony out of ba, ba, ba, baam in C minor, in E flat major or C major, whatever he does. To do that, he's just taking one theme and he is doing that with a recursion. Now when I would watch Erickson, he wasn't using so much redundancy and repetition, he would be using recursions. So if you're doing an induction with somebody and you're saying to them you can close your eyes and really feel a peaceful sensation. A sensation that can be realized as a feeling of ease. And that feeling of ease can be a sense of real tranquility. And that tranquility can be like the most profound relaxation and an ease and a softness. I'm saying the same thing. But I'm saying it recursively and I'm not saying it redundantly. And when we need to help people to realize ideas we may need to find many ways of communicating those ideas. And once I could understand the principal of recursions, it made a tremendous difference in the way that I did inductions. And I could understand that through music. And then there is this strategic development, and Beethoven is remarkably strategic and Jay Haley characterized Erickson's work as strategic therapy. And he defined an uncommon therapy that is strategic therapy is when the therapist has a goal in mind and works to get to that goal. Now in 1973 when Jay Haley published Uncommon Therapy, that was news that somebody could be strategic in therapy, and Erickson was without question the most remarkably strategic therapist setting up ideas across sessions. And Bochner did this in the ring setting up a theme in one aspect of the ring that he would return to in another aspect much later and Erickson would do this. I remember I was watching a video tape of Erickson and he was working with this woman and he said as an apparent non sequitur, if there was a blond woman sitting across from you, you'd have no reason to be jealous, would you?" She just shrugged her shoulders and said no. Well it so happen that I put on the next video tape from a week after that was serendipitous. And he had the same woman, and he had a blond woman sitting across from her and he was doing a double induction. And he was setting this up a week in advance. It's remarkable strategy, but you had somebody who was a farm boy who, uh, you know had a father who was planting fruit tree saplings in his 90s because he wanted to see them develop and understood something about the growth and development of things and how they happen over time. So ba, ba, ba, baam, that fate motif it's cloned, it's repeated, it's developed strategically across the, uh, the uh, the symphony. And then there is this seeding, a foreshadowing. We talked about this in the advanced workshop, making an implicit reference to a future theme that awakens the representation when it's presented later. A tangential reference to an earlier theme is known to have an effect awakening that theme when it's reviewed later. I graphed that for you in the air that taking a reference to one theme and returning to it later increases the accessibility of that theme. In social psychology this is called priming. And then Beethoven used little destabilizations. Little moments of disharmony and, uh, used those moments of disharmony because disharmony is just an unstable harmony that promises a stable harmony to follow. And if you don't use unstable harmonies, you have a tune like Mary Had a Little Lamb. It doesn't have the complexity of the Fifth Symphony where there has to be moments of instability. Now Erickson called this the confusion technique. And he said every induction is based on confusion whether or not the operator realizes it. But Bernard talks about it much better as a kind of destabilization or a disharmony. Now if I say to my students use the confusion technique, they haze over. But if I say here's what Beethoven did in using disharmony, here's what you are used to in movies as disharmony, here's what you're used to in, um, in uh, in art. When you go to a movie and you see the way in which it's framed, like putting a person in the center of the screen, it's not done. Now this is implicit. It's a code in movies. So we push the person off to the side to the right or to the left of the screen and open up the screen. Now if I was making a movie I wouldn't understand that code. I would put people in the middle, but it doesn't create the kind of tension, the visual tension, that keeps the viewer interested. So we could call this deception or dissonance or instability, which is part of the structure. And then there needs to be novelty. Ernie has talked repeatedly about how novelty causes neurogenesis. A multilevel presentation compacting the music and making, bringing in other instruments, starting with a simple theme, adding to it, making it multilevel. If you're doing hypnosis you learn to be an expert on multilevel communication. Are we doing okay? I'm giving you a laundry list. And this is customary to me and my way of teaching is giving people a laundry list, but what I do with this is that I try to pick a technique of the month. And I say, okay this month I work with disharmony and I try to practice using momentary disharmonies. Like if you've read Erickson's early learning set induction and he's talking about learning to write the letter of the alphabet and suddenly he is saying, did you dot the T and cross the I? And you're thinking, ohhh. And there's just this momentary instability in the warp and weave of the induction that would create a kind of dissonance and change the level of tension and creating attunement and how we attune ourselves to other people with, uh, pacing their breathing or pacing their posture. And Beethoven would have to do that to some extent. Movies are an elicitation model. They don't work on information. Movies are known as a show don't tell medium. Documentaries are very difficult because they're in a medium of telling when the purpose of that medium is show don't tell. And this is what Ernie called the elicitation model of hypnosis. That hypnosis is not about induction, it's about elicitation. And then the use of metaphor. The fate motif is a metaphor. And Erickson was certainly known for his use of metaphor. And with Beethoven's remarkable precision, I said in the advanced workshop and I'll repeat it here, that when I was with Milton Erickson I never felt so loved. And the reason for that is that every word was said by choice, intention. And the meaning of the word intentional. And the gestures that he used. Intentional. And the meaning of the gestures was intentional. And he was working so hard to have an effect on me and making everything so precise. And the feeling of that was I never felt so loved in my life. But it wasn't me, this is who he was with the remarkable concentration that he had to be able to do that. And then you have the drama. You have the contrasting elements of fate and hope. And you have ambiguity. Beethoven doesn't say that this is a story about how fate triumphs, uh, how hope triumphs over fate. It's ambiguous. And then there's the symmetry. Both of the sections have a crescendo and the crescendo comes symmetrically. And he must have thought about that strategically, about how to create that. And then deletion. So Beethoven takes a single horn, and that single horn, ba, ba, ba, ba, baam, is the bridge, is the musical bridge between the fate motif and the hope motif. And over the course of the symphony he deletes it and he, and he changes it so that you no longer need an introduction to hope. It's incredibly beautiful and so thoughtful. And it's invisible to us. But it has impact. And then the overlapping of using different instruments and the lack of punctuation. Music has continuity. It just moves without punctuation. And when Erickson was doing an induction of hypnosis, I did him a disservice because when I edited the book A Teaching Seminar with Milton Erickson, I took out some of the conjunctions because I thought that the book wouldn't read well if I left in all of the conjunctions because Erickson would tell a one-hour story and follow with another one-hour story. And I started to remove those conjunctions thinking that I was a good editor not realizing this is what he did. So to Erickson, inductions were like music. They were like one long sentence. You can take a deep breath so that you can really feel comfortable. A feeling of ease. A sense of well-being. Slowly growing. More deeply absorbed in the experience. Growing more pleasantly absorbed in the experience so that you can really take a deep breath and find yourself even more absorbed comfortably and easily in the experience. Where's the punctuation? Well music, symphony music, doesn't have much punctuation. There wasn't much punctuation in Beethoven's Fifth. What's the purpose of that linkage? Well the purpose of that linkage is this is the way human beings think. We may write with punctuation but we don't think with punctuation. Our thoughts and images and ideas and associations, they all just tumble together. And it's a continuous stream. So when Erickson was creating an induction it was a continuous stream. It was, it was modeling, mirroring, attuning to human, to the human associative process. And then alterations and emphasis. You can really go inside. Uh-huh. And using paradoxical techniques in congruence. When I met with Richard Sherman and I was asking him about writing Mary Poppins, and he was explaining to me some of the structural thinking that he did when he and his brother were writing the score for Mary Poppins, just a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down, and he knew that he was being paradoxical because Mary Poppins is a paradoxical creature. And Mary Poppins slides up the banister. And so he wanted music that would express the paradoxical nature of who Mary Poppins was. And then of course there were fermata, pause, a slight change in tempo. And the sense of compression. Moving things into its most compressed form to have impact and still a unified sensibility. Now, I didn't exhaust this. Uh, the inversions that, that Beethoven would use. This is traditional for a composer to take a theme ba, ba, ba, baam and invert it and see how it worked out and then add those inversions in. And this is what Beethoven was doing. And I have to believe that he thought it through. And I have to believe that Erickson thought it through. Because Erickson and I, I was graced to have one session with Dr. Erickson, two actually, two different days where we spent five hours going over a 50-minute induction. And he explained to me moment to moment what he was thinking. And, uh, I thought I knew the induction and then he was two or three levels of understanding deeper than I was at explaining what he was doing and why. And why he would use a definite article, THE car, rather than an indefinite article. He knew what he was doing. So now, understanding 26 implicit codes of impact. Let's return to Beethoven and now let's listen to that segment of the Fifth one more time with an understanding of all of those codes. 

00:46:05
[music] 

00:47:40
JEFFREY ZEIG But to tell you the truth. I don't know. Does it help you to understand the 26 implicit codes that Beethoven used? But the point of this is that the person who experiences the art, the person who experiences the induction, the person who experiences the trance, cannot know about the structure. Because if you know the structure it's information and it doesn't have an impact. And I drive my wife crazy because we go to the movies and I'm looking at the structure of how the moviemaker is putting together the movie. And then I drive myself a little crazy because I don't feel the movie, I intellectualize it. Uh-huh. But I'm really interested in trying to learn more of these codes and a lot of that has to do with Alex Vesely who is in the back of the room because Alex, who is Viktor Frankl's grandson, who is doing the movie The Wizard of the Desert, a documentary about Dr. Erickson, um, was my student for a month. He lived with my wife and I and he studied with his Viennese dramaturg Christian Mikunda, a genius and very well-known in Germany for his strategic dramaturgy. And Alex was his student. And, um, the idea of understanding, the structure of understanding these codes of impact comes directly out of Christian's work. And, uh, fortunately I'm going to be doing a workshop with him in Graz in Austria, uh, next year. So we can relate Beethoven and Erickson by this evocative impact. We can understand that the impact of hypnosis is affective through the evocative nature of communication. And the more that we understand the evocative nature of communication the better we will be about hypnosis. The better we'll be about psychotherapy. And, uh, I don't have time for you. I've been doing little hypnotic inductions throughout the demonstration. I was going to play a little clip of Erikson, but we don't have time. But certainly these kinds of techniques, like I picked out 12 of them and I hope that when you look at the handout you will think about these 12 especially as ways in which you can use to improve your induction, to improve your hypnosis, to improve your psychotherapy. So implicit influence is needed to change states and the recipient of the art experiences the affect implicitly but the creator of the art can understand structurally. And responsive behavior, it's not the structure, it's the response. We judge the communication by the response that it elicits not by the cleverness of the structure. And Erikson explored human responsiveness. B.A. was talking about this book, Nightmare Ally. And Erickson gave me the book and he said to me as I remember, he said to me that B.A. and Mrs. Erickson had read the book and then gave the book to him and that he read the first page and that he predicted what it would say on the last page because it was foreshadowed. So when you look at the handout I invite you to read the first page of this opening of Nightmare Ally, a kind of obscure novel which was made into a Tyrone Power black and white film many, uh, years ago and, uh, I read it and I said to Dr. Erickson I have no idea, what does it say on the last page? And he said, read the book. So I read the book. I read the last page. I looked back at the first page and I went, oh. If I knew, if I understood the implicit code that the writer was using foreshadowing where this book was going, I would have, uh, had a better understanding of the strategic nature of how art has impact. Every artist uses this. Foreshadowing or an overture in music, or as we call it in Ericksonian therapy, seeding, and this implicit impact is part of our sociobiology. We are heard animals. This is the way we respond. We respond to implicit influence because lizards do and because birds do and because mammals do. This is part of our, of the understructure of our brain. It's necessary. So states. Just take three more minutes of your time. Using some of Paul Ekman, who is going to be the keynote speaker at our next conference, here's emotions. Here are moods. Here are states. So emotions fleeting. You're immediately upset. You're immediately happy. They're fleeting. They're part of our sociobiology. Moods are kind of a calcified emotions. I'm in a happy mood. I'm in a depressed mood. States, well, they are more difficult to understand. They are complex. Because being connected, it's not an emotion. And being trustworthy, that's not emotion either. And being alert or present or focused or cooperative or believing or respectful; these are not emotions. But you know when you're creative and you know that they are different. You know when you're present and you know when you're not. And you know when you're hypnotized and you know when you're not. And you can't really define it as an emotion but you know that when our patients come to you they come because they are in negative states. Because they're disengaged or confused or lazy or deceptive or prejudice or irresponsible, withdrawn or doubting or disrespectful. And the part of our job is to help people transition from these negative states into more constructive or positive states and that's why we need to know something about evocative impact. If you want to be a patient, just get lost in a negative state. If you want to be a therapist we need to understand how to use elaborations to elicit more functional states to create reference experiences for people that bring them into different states. So our fundamental thesis is our clients they come to use because they want to change their state, but sometimes they come to us because they want their spouse to change their states. And that, um, using codes from hypnosis is, a, a way that are unrecognized but felt. This is a way in which we, uh, can understand. And I'll move forward because impact should address subcortical regions of the brain. Animals communicate experientially. So do artists, novelists, and composers. And the structure of language has a dual function. Language is both evocative and informative and as a prejudice I say that psychotherapy has been cursed by being moved into the informative realm without a full understanding of the evocative nature of communication and that we need to understand more about the evocative nature of communication. And that's where music takes us. Symphonic music. And, uh, this underlying theme that emotional impact is implicit, if it's explicit, if it's information. So we have one more little rendition, which is Beethoven's Fifth revisited, slightly different theme to end with. And, uh, this is also, uh, available from the internet.

JEFFERY ZEIG Thank you. With just a little thanks and a tip of the hat to Robert Greenberg I've been listening to some of his, uh, incredible expositions about music to try to understand the structure of music, and he does the Learning Company teach12.com. You know, he is their stellar performer and explains a, a lot about music. It's a wonderful music appreciation course. So I invited him, and he will be one of the keynote speakers in Brief Therapy 2012. So, uh, the handout is available at, uh, EricksonCongress.com. Thank you all so very, very much.
