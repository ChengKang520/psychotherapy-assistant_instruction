TRACI POSTINGS Let's move on to the session. And, um, also with a lot of gratitude to Lucy, uh, for her honesty and courage. Hello again, Lucy. 

00:00:25
LUCY Hello. 

00:00:25
TRACI POSTINGS How are you today? 

00:00:30
LUCY  Hmm, I don't even know. 

00:00:40
[sil.] 

00:00:45
TRACI POSTINGS Well I know that we met for the first time last week and, you know, we talked about a lot of stuff and -- I think most of – you know, we were talking about, you know, your drug use. Um, how dark life became then. And, um, and in a way, although life is, you know, much better now that you're not using any drugs. But it's, uh, its difficult. And, um, painful. 

00:01:20
LUCY Um-hmm. 

00:01:20
LUCY And that we looked at, you know – looked at some of the things that have happened in your life. And, I know talking about your mom's death and – and all the things that you went through. You know, during your active addiction and -- 

00:01:40
LUCY And you say, all right, it's better now. It is better. But it's – I – I just imagined that I'd stop taking drugs and my life would be all right. And the aim is just – it's really really hard. 

00:01:55
TRACI POSTINGS I know you said last week that it's really really hard. And what does that mean? What – what hard, where's hard? 

00:02:05
LUCY  Um, all of it really. I think life. How – how I'm supposed to – it's like I don't know what to do. It's kind of like I've want to get up and I go through the day but it just – it just doesn't seem easy. It's just such a -- it's just stuck. I feel stuck a lot of the time. I – it's like turmoil. There's -- 

00:02:40
TRACI POSTINGS Under turmoil. Something that – and you spoke of that last week. It's something that seems to be with you a lot of the time. And you also said last week about not being able to settle. Not being easy. 

00:03:00
LUCY It's like that all the time. It's just that I – it's like I just got to do things. All the time just got to do, do, do, do, do. And I try and go home and just sit down. And I've got to clean up. And I can't even watch telly. And then I've got to speak to someone. It's just like when is it – when is it just going to stop. Do you know what I mean. That – this is how I feel. It's like, when is it going to be all right. 

00:03:30
TRACI POSTINGS When is it going to be all right. Or when are you going to be all right. Which one are we talking about? 

00:03:35
LUCY  I don't know really. Um, will I ever be all right. I don't know. 

00:03:55
TRACI POSTINGS There was something about that but – that seemed quite tricky to hear as I said when will it be all right or when will you be all right. You really – I don't know. How did that feel when I said that. Because you seemed to really, like, hold up. 

00:04:10
LUCY Yeah. I thought that -- that kind of threw me, I think. Is it – is it me. Is it -- 

00:04:20
TRACI POSTINGS What is it? 

00:04:20
LUCY What is it, yeah. What. 

00:04:20
TRACI POSTINGS What is it? 

00:04:25
[sil.] 

00:04:35
LUCY Yeah, I don't even know what it is. 

00:04:40
TRACI POSTINGS But we keep saying it. As if it's a thing. 

00:04:50
LUCY Just does. It – it fucking hurts. 

00:04:55
TRACI POSTINGS And it's something in you that hurts. 

00:05:00
LUCY Maybe. 

00:05:05
[sil.] 

00:05:20
LUCY I just wished it was all different, really. 

00:05:25
[sil.] 

00:05:35
LUCY You know, if – since I think like if my – if my mom never died would I have took drugs. Would I have ended up taking heroin, I don't know. Whether my brothers introduced me to it, would I have ever took it if my upbringing was different, would I be different and -- well I kind of rough it. But it just seems to be kind of no different. But different. Thought I'm not in prison. And I'm not committing crime and -- I think it's like I don't know what I was expecting but -- I just want to be all right. 

00:06:20
TRACI POSTINGS And actually, it sounds as if a part of you is still in prison. Because you said, you know, I'm not – I'm not in prison but there's this. When it's going to be all right. When's it going to –when's it – what is it and was it this. And a searching and a trying to work it all out. And understand me here. If my life's much bad. But actually to be honest it doesn't sound as if it's much better for a part of you. But the practicalities might be better. But part of you is still locked away in prison. 

00:07:00
LUCY But – so how I'm – how I'm supposed to understand all that. That's -- it's like is that what I don't know. Is that why I've come here. Um, I just don't really understand you all really. 

00:07:25
TRACI POSTINGS So why do you think you came here. 

00:07:30
LUCY I don't – to get – to get some understanding of it. So I can get there, wherever I'm going. Just endless. I just sometimes think if my mom's was still here would that make me feel better. If I'd a job would it be better. If I'd a boyfriend would it be better. It's just like anything – grabbing on to anything really. It's – just to make me feel better really. 

00:08:15
TRACI POSTINGS Just something outside that you can take inside and – and find some peace. 

00:08:20
LUCY Yeah. This feeling – I could just feel that. Um, it's like a hole. 

00:08:30
TRACI POSTINGS And nothing's filling it. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
LUCY Even food. It just – I – I can eat and eat and eat and eat and eat. And then I just feel sick. And then I – I think you fat bitch. 

00:08:50
TRACI POSTINGS So then, does this need that you – to keep eating, to keep doing something to get something. But they you really give yourself a hard time. It's just doesn't lead in something. 

00:09:05
LUCY Yeah, it just doesn't fill up. 

00:09:10
TRACI POSTINGS It's a hole in your bucket, Lucy. 

00:09:10
LUCY There's a hole in my bucket. 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:20
LUCY Yeah. 

00:09:25
TRACI POSTINGS You've mentioned your mom a couple of times. 

00:09:30
[sil.] 

00:09:35
LUCY I don't' know. I just think, um, it would have been really nice – I've – do you know what. I think I'll get, um – I'll get jealous of other people. And they go, like – I'll go mommy, moms. And I'll go like, oh. And it really kind of – so now that I'm grown up. And I'd like to have a relationship with her. But it's almost again. I'm never going to have that. Do you know what I mean. It's – it's just not going to happen. And even if she was still alive um, she most tell me to go away anyway. 

00:10:25
TRACI POSTINGS So that's -- 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:35
TRACI POSTINGS That seems odd that you're desperate to have this person, to have something to make it okay. And you want your mom. And yet there's also the -- and it didn't sound like a fair. It sounded more like, uh -- a maybe that she'd tell you to go away. 

00:11:05
LUCY And that she was quiet harsh and I – I just wanted her to be nice to me, really. 

00:11:15
TRACI POSTINGS You wanted a mom. 

00:11:15
LUCY Yeah. 

00:11:15
TRACI POSTINGS  You wanted one and you need one now. 

00:11:25
LUCY This is that feeling of, um – I going to be all right, you know. Maybe just want someone to tell you it's going to be all right. 

00:11:30
TRACI POSTINGS  Yes. Comfort. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:45
LUCY Oh. 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:55
LUCY So what do I do? Do you know what I mean, what am I supposed to do if -- 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:05
LUCY Did you know when I took gear and all that – that I didn't get this. I didn't get all this. And I just wasn't expecting that, um, I just keep getting overwhelmed. And I just get really really sad. And -- 

00:12:20
TRACI POSTINGS  Sounds like there's just nothing that can – there's nothing that you can find that can look after a little girl who wants her mom. And it's just too much for you to try and manage. 

00:12:45
LUCY Um-hmm. 

00:12:45
TRACI POSTINGS But it sounds like the girl did it in a weird sort of way. That it was your mom for awhile. 

00:12:50
LUCY Yeah. Yeah, it kind of helped me. That's -- 

00:12:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:12:55
LUCY That's something that we say that – there's – um, that'll hold me for a little while. 

00:13:00
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. That'll hold me till I get someone else. 

00:13:00
LUCY Yeah. 

00:13:00
TRACI POSTINGS  And maybe that's what you are looking for now. You're looking for someone to hold you. 

00:13:05
LUCY Yeah. Now that makes sense. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
LUCY I just – it's quite scary really. Because -- because this is – is how it – it's kind of going to be. Because constant me just trying to – um, make myself feel all right, really. 

00:13:45
TRACI POSTINGS And also, it's blooming horrible because the fantasy was and the promise was, you stop using and it'll be okay. And instead everything that held you together in a sense, it feels as if it's gone. 

00:14:00
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:14:00
LUCY And what's so horrible is what was holding you together was killing you as well. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:30
LUCY I think – I don't know where I've gone. I just, uh -- 

00:14:30
TRACI POSTINGS  You said, I don't know where I've gone. 

00:14:35
LUCY How long have we've got left. 

00:14:40
TRACI POSTINGS We've got a little while. Feels as if some part of you has had enough. 

00:14:45
LUCY Yeah. 

00:14:50
TRACI POSTINGS It's like right, that's it. 

00:14:50
LUCY It's – yeah. 

00:14:50
TRACI POSTINGS I'll be off now. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:05
LUCY Yeah, so, yeah. 

00:15:05
TRACI POSTINGS Sounds a different part of you now, is that right. Thank you. 

00:15:15
LUCY Yeah. I thought I'd -- just uh, the (inaudible ). So, it's almost like closed now. 

00:15:25
TRACI POSTINGS So, a little part that we see and now that shift. And I'm mindful that you said you came here looking for answers, looking for – to sort it. And, uh – and maybe it shift against me who's not giving those answers. I'm not telling you what the solution is. 

00:15:50
LUCY But will you be able to do that, though. If I can't find it. So, where do I look? 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:10
LUCY Yeah. Uh, again I thought, um, well that just shows me that everywhere I go expecting – I expect it from my mom. She never gave me anything. Um -- 

00:16:25
TRACI POSTINGS And I was just thinking exactly that. That you come here with an expectation. 

00:16:30
LUCY Yeah. 

00:16:30
TRACI POSTINGS And I just join a long line of people that let you down. And I don't come up with the goods. 

00:16:40
LUCY So what do you do then. Why am I – what is supposed to happen. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:55
LUCY Because it just sounds – is this going to be another way to die. I'm just know everything else, really. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:10
LUCY Go, fucking hell this is just -- 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:20
TRACI POSTINGS Sounds like it's pissing you off? 

00:17:20
LUCY Yeah. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
TRACI POSTINGS And yet when I said it sounds like you – it's pissing you off. And I think what I meant was maybe I'm pissing you off. But you said, yeah. But – actually said yeah. It sounded like you weren't pissed off any more. If that make sense. And you sort of went down, maybe it's difficult to be. Don't know. Have it with things. 

00:17:50
LUCY Yeah. I think I don't – um, I don't know if – I don't know really. I don't know if I'm pissed off with you. I don't even know you enough to be pissed off with you really. I'm just pissed off of it all really. With myself, with life. With -- just got – I just can't get out of that one. I wished it was different. 

00:18:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:18:25
LUCY I just wished it was different. 

00:18:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. How would you have it Lucy? How would it be? 

00:18:30
LUCY Um -- 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:40
LUCY I would have liked to have been special. That's what I'd liked. To have been, uh -- to been shown some love and attention. I think more of attention than. And I remember being at school and, um, you know, like the mom's used to come in. Take their kids, drop their kids off. And I used to have to go to school on me own. And, uh, you know, just that sort of envy. Like, oh, I wished my mom done that. You know, pack lunch. And pocket money and – and be able to buy sweets in the morning. And -- yeah. And even my mom saying good night really. So do you know what, I just think this is, um, like even though she died that – it's almost like dream. And I, um, I wanted it to be like that. But actually it won't. So it's hard to get out – you know, like people say to me, oh, was you close to your mom. And I go yeah. But I won't. 

00:20:05
TRACI POSTINGS But you wanted to be. 

00:20:05
LUCY Yeah. And that's, uh, but it's almost like – because I've know – because I know I'm never going to have it. I can make it up as I want it to happen. 

00:20:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:20:20
LUCY And that is the reality. Like I said, it's – it's, uh – if I went to her now she most going to say go away anyway. 

00:20:30
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

00:20:30
LUCY So I kind – I kind of know that, but I can't get out of that fantasy just to pretend it's -- 

00:20:35
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

00:20:35
LUCY -- it's all okay. Do you know what I mean. 

00:20:40
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And that you are special to her. And you are loved. 

00:20:40
LUCY Yeah. 

00:20:45
TRACI POSTINGS That somebody comes to school and makes you a packed lunch. And says na-night. And tucks you up. And loves you. And loves you in a way so that you feel loved. 

00:20:55
LUCY Yeah. Just felt loved really is good. 

00:21:00
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

00:21:00
LUCY By myself, do you know what I mean. She was actually quite frightening. 

00:21:05
TRACI POSTINGS  So were lonely and scared. 

00:21:15
LUCY Yeah. Oh, I think that's how I feel when I – at the time actually. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
LUCY And again, I kind of, uh, I still. Pretend it's all right. And I know you're fine, you're fine. 

00:21:45
TRACI POSTINGS It's all okay. 

00:21:45
LUCY Yeah. But I still got that feeling there. It's just -- 

00:21:50
TRACI POSTINGS So you've traveled a hell of a journey. And you've arrived at the lonely and scared loveless place. 

00:22:00
LUCY  Yeah. And this is what – because hard enough is I've been – I've been to prison loads of times. And I'm tough. I'm a tough cookie. And that's what's almost thrown actually. Um, we've not this recovery. This is – this is what's -- 

00:22:25
TRACI POSTINGS  Now what you were expecting. 

00:22:30
LUCY No. I didn't know about um -- and you know that's quite weird actually. Because I could have said I didn't know what it was like to be lonely or scared. But I just said that as a child I was like that. 

00:22:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:22:50
LUCY But I didn't know -- 

00:22:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:22:50
LUCY -- I'd felt like that. 

00:22:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:23:00
LUCY So is this – this is what was supposed to happen. Um, you give up the drugs and that comes -- 

00:23:10
TRACI POSTINGS Well, this is what has happened. And the – it's almost – what I'm – what I've been thinking the last few minutes is if you have ever heard the – the story of the little match girl. 

00:23:25
LUCY No. 

00:23:25
TRACI POSTINGS So have you heard that story? 

00:23:25
LUCY Vague – vaguely. 

00:23:25
TRACI POSTINGS She, um, is very poor and raggedy. And – in briefly, she sells matches. To try and get a few pennies. And the people are – look after her don't look after her. They're very cruel and she's not treated well. And, uh, and one winter is so cold that even though she's going to get in trouble she lights a match. Just for a little bit of warmth. Just for a little bit of warmth, just a little bit. But when she lights the match in the flame she sees what she remembers as her grandmother's house. And in the flame she sees a loving grandmother. And a table with food. And she sees a warm fire. Everything she's ever wanted. Then the match goes out. And she's too frightened then to light another one. But the next night when she's in the snow and the cold she lights a match. And she sees again everything she ever wanted in that flame. And it goes out. But this time she lights another. And another. And another. Until they're all gone. And it just reminded me if you're talking about fear and – and drug use that – for that time you didn't feel. You didn't know about the fear and the aloneness. And the terror and misery. Because the promise was in the flame. But that's gone. The matches are all burnt out. 

00:24:55
LUCY And this is it now. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
TRACI POSTINGS However, I'm also very mindful of a few minutes ago you said, but I'm tough. What's this. What's this, I'm tough. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:25
TRACI POSTINGS And you see I believe the little girl. Absolutely. But I also believe the tough part or you wouldn't be sitting here. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:45
LUCY But I don't know if I can handle this – this part. This is -- 

00:25:50
TRACI POSTINGS It's too heavy, too much. 

00:25:55
LUCY It's kind of like – it's quite easy to be tough. I kind of like her. The toughness is wearing out, really. 

00:26:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah, yeah. And there's nowhere to hide. There's no drugs. There's no – there's no – there's no matches. There's no matches. 

00:26:25
LUCY Yeah. 

00:26:30
TRACI POSTINGS And the pain is so deep. And the wound so raw at the minute. It's like oh my god, what am I'm going to do with this. 

00:26:35
LUCY Yeah. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:50
LUCY So what do I do then. 

00:26:50
TRACI POSTINGS Well, what are we going to do about this. 

00:26:55
LUCY Well you tell me because you're the therapist. 

00:27:00
TRACI POSTINGS What does she need? 

00:27:05
LUCY I don't know. I need a match. 

00:27:15
TRACI POSTINGS And the match always work. The bitter gear always worked. But actually every single time without fail it abandoned you just like everybody else did. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
TRACI POSTINGS And I'm sitting and wondering if the trick is to find one of them, every lighted matches. 

00:27:40
LUCY Yeah. That'll be good, wouldn't it. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
LUCY Yeah. Just like will it ever um -- you know what she said in the match, I can see what you're saying. Will I ever get to that – is life, um, well I can honestly say it's like, if I light – would that match become real. 

00:28:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah, yes. 

00:28:15
LUCY Do you know what I mean. Or is it just going to be wishing. Wishing, wishing. 

00:28:20
TRACI POSTINGS And more fantasy. 

00:28:20
LUCY Yeah. 

00:28:20
TRACI POSTINGS And more pretend and more illusion. 

00:28:25
LUCY  Because that's what – I said, all right. Now it's – I'm going to – when I leave here in a minute I'm just going to go, like, oh hello, yeah I'm fine. 

00:28:35
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:40
LUCY And pretend. 

00:28:40
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:28:45
LUCY And just do whatever I can. 

00:28:50
TRACI POSTINGS To get through the day. I'm wondering, you know, that part, the survivor, usually goes about and says hello, you all right, what you doing, yeah, and that's a laugh. And – and, you know. The tough bit. Did that part of you bring the other part here. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
TRACI POSTINGS To be able to be with thee. Just the awful emptiness. 

00:29:20
LUCY Um-hmm. I don't know. I – I just came. 

00:29:25
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Looking for answers. 

00:29:30
LUCY Yeah. 

00:29:30
TRACI POSTINGS That you're not getting. 

00:29:30
LUCY Yeah. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
LUCY All right, so. Like, how many times have I got to see you. Another five times. 

00:29:50
TRACI POSTINGS And it's, uh, it's like we've gone right you're your head. For, okay. I need to chart now. Do six of these and three of them. 

00:30:00
LUCY And then -- 

00:30:00
TRACI POSTINGS And four them and it'll be all right. 

00:30:05
LUCY Yeah. Then it'll be all right. 

00:30:05
TRACI POSTINGS And it feels very different in here then when we were talking about the failings. When we were talking about – when we were talking about the hurt. We become quite business like. 

00:30:20
LUCY  All right. Um, yeah, but still – I still -- 

00:30:25
TRACI POSTINGS  How much longer. 

00:30:30
LUCY Yeah. So can you not tell me that then. Can you not, um, you ain't got the answers. Have I got the answers. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:05
LUCY I just seems all to hard again. 

00:31:05
TRACI POSTINGS Umm, yeah. And it feels really heavy at the minute and. And what – what do we do. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:25
TRACI POSTINGS And yet what really – and I was going to say what really strikes me. Which is really interesting after talking about matches. But as you said what you were looking on, looking for a match. Actually since we've been talking although life is harder, practically it's much better. But you're in so much more discomfort and disease, since you've stopped taking drugs. I haven't heard you say, I want to go and use something. I want to go and use drugs. I've heard you say you want your mom. Bu I haven' heard you say, I've had enough of this, I'm going to go get -- 

00:32:00
LUCY I can't. I can't. I've used for so long. Um, I've tried to stop so many times. I'm sick of smoking crack. Being raped and sick of prison. 

00:32:20
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:32:20
LUCY And I've tried to stop loads of times. But what happened was, I got, um, I got sick of the drugs. 

00:32:30
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:32:30
LUCY And I used to – when I used to score I used to – it used to be in my hand and – there's like a famous walk, like you got the walk on. Because you know that the smoke. And I lost it. 

00:32:45
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:32:45
LUCY And I -- so that, yeah. I just – I don't feel like smoking drugs. But I just want to feel all right. 

00:32:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. You'd had enough of that. 

00:33:00
LUCY It didn't – it stopped working. It stopped doing what it said on the tin for me. 

00:33:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And so there's an ending there. And here we are in a – okay. That don't work. But you're in a place that don't work. We're not there yet. And this middle place of well, what will work. What do I have to do. 

00:33:25
LUCY Okay. Okay. 

00:33:30
TRACI POSTINGS It's between a rock and a hard place really. It's really difficult. 

00:33:35
LUCY Yeah. But you know what, that's kind of made me feel good a bit. Because I didn't think that I wasn't – that I would have been thinking of using. So I'm not thinking of using. 

00:33:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:33:50
LUCY So that's got to be a good thing, isn't it. 

00:33:55
TRACI POSTINGS You're looking for comfort. And you're looking for ease. And, you know, do I get a job. I want mom. I want – you're looking for something. 

00:34:05
LUCY So, have I got to get that, though. 

00:34:05
TRACI POSTINGS And what did you say you wanted to feel special. 

00:34:10
LUCY Yeah. 

00:34:10
TRACI POSTINGS You wanted to feel special. And you wanted to feel cared for. You wanted to have somebody make you a packed lunch. 

00:34:20
LUCY Yeah, huh. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:35
LUCY Oh. Sounds quite silly. 

00:34:45
TRACI POSTINGS Silly? 

00:34:45
LUCY Somewhat – I want someone to make me pack lunch. 

00:34:50
TRACI POSTINGS Oh. But to go to school all nice and clean, nice uniform nice clothes. Your pack lunch in a little box, wrapped up nice. Instead of the picture I got of the little girl you said, just went in all the old how with nobody to say good bye. No body to make breakfast. 

00:35:10
LUCY Yeah. And I – do you know what, this is – this is what I get. Because that ain't going to happen anymore. That's past. That's -- this is where I get angry. Because it's like, um, I want all of that, but it's gone. It's gone. Do you know what I mean. And then that's —because I suppose all right that's where I'll go with my mom. I want it. I wanted it. But then I'll get – well you never bloody gave it to me. 

00:35:45
TRACI POSTINGS And it's too late now. 

00:35:50
LUCY Well, it's too late now. What if, what if, what if, what if, what if. 

00:35:55
TRACI POSTINGS  If only. 

00:36:00
LUCY Yeah. 

00:36:00
TRACI POSTINGS Maybe. 

00:36:05
LUCY So that's kind of what goes on. Do you know what I mean. What -- again looking back at the girls at school. I wonder if they – I wanted to have their life. Is – do you know what I mean. If they became normal, you know what I mean. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:30
TRACI POSTINGS Of if they walked through hell like you have. 

00:36:35
LUCY And it's really strange what you're saying because I've – it's like the lives – if I – if I told someone about my life. The crack houses, being raped, being beaten up, fighting, going to prison. Saying it like that sounds quite awful. But to me it was normal. 

00:37:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. Exactly. And it's like when you spoke of being little. You weren't aware of the loneliness and the emptiness. Looking back it was like, oh that's what it was like for me. 

00:37:15
LUCY Yeah. And I didn't know that then. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
TRACI POSTINGS And there's something so – it's so awful, Lucy, about those terrible things being normal. Being, you know, just how it is. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
LUCY So I've got – tried to become to be normal. 

00:37:55
TRACI POSTINGS so you want to be normal? 

00:37:55
LUCY I want to be normal. I just want to be normal. And have me packed lunch and go to work and someone to look after me. And have a dog. 

00:38:10
TRACI POSTINGS Who's going to make the packed lunch? Now? 

00:38:15
LUCY Now? Um, well I suppose I'll have to at the moment. I don't know. So I've got to do this then if I -- 

00:38:30
TRACI POSTINGS Got a bit of the bread. Chose the filling. 

00:38:35
LUCY Yeah. 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
TRACI POSTINGS Don't sound like it's what you wanted to hear. 

00:38:45
LUCY Not really. Because it's still not someone taking care of me. 

00:38:50
TRACI POSTINGS  And it don't fill enough to take care of yourself. It's, like – it's needing an outside person to feel special to somebody. 

00:39:05
LUCY Um, I don't think I know how to take care of me self. That's -- yeah, well that's a bit, um, that's kind of hit home a bit. 

00:39:30
TRACI POSTINGS It's difficult to know how to do something if you've never been taught or never seen it done. 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:50
LUCY Oh, I just go into – just seems too much. 

00:39:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:39:50
LUCY Too much. 

00:39:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:39:55
LUCY And again, it fucking sounds so silly because to make a pack lunch, to buy a bit of bread, seems hard work. 

00:40:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And it is. Because it ain't a bit of bread. I mean it is a bit of bread. But there's so much more in it. 

00:40:20
[sil.] 

00:40:25
LUCY It's all mad stuff. 

00:40:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:35
TRACI POSTINGS Start talking about prison and drugs and the awfulness and we end up talking about a pack lunch. 

00:40:45
LUCY Yeah. Yeah. That's just mad because I could -- I feel like I could handle that life. 

00:40:55
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Yeah. You know how to suffer. 

00:41:05
LUCY I know how to -- 

00:41:05
TRACI POSTINGS You know to survive. 

00:41:05
LUCY -- survive. Survive, yeah. 

00:41:15
TRACI POSTINGS But you're just learning how to live. 

00:41:15
LUCY Oh, okay. Yeah. That – um, that sounds nice. But actually the thought of it is if this is life, if this -- 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:45
LUCY It's quite strange than that – the hole seems to be a little bit gone for a minute. 

00:41:50
TRACI POSTINGS  What's filled it Lucy? 

00:42:00
LUCY I don't know. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:10
LUCY You know what even – even maybe someone is bloody listening to me. 

00:42:10
TRACI POSTINGS That sounds as if anybody ever has. 

00:42:15
LUCY No. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:30
LUCY No, I don't think they have really. But hey, yeah, hey. All right, we got – we finished in a minute, aren't we. 

00:42:40
TRACI POSTINGS  Um-hmm. Not far. I've got about five minutes. But again, we got to, wow, that's enough of that now. Thank you. 

00:42:50
LUCY I'm all right now. 

00:42:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yup. It's good actually. You know, it's – it's interesting. I think earlier on it was like, woo, don't think much of this. I'm off. But actually we are coming up to time. And considering you said I don't know how to look after myself it's all new. There's a part of you that saying, hold on a minute have I – I'll go back into the world in a minute. Back into all right, how you doing, yeah, I'm fine. So I need to, you know, I need to be less vulnerable. 

00:43:25
LUCY Oh, okay. 

00:43:25
TRACI POSTINGS Then you have been in times here. Which is looking after yourself. 

00:43:25
LUCY  Oh, okay. Oh, so I've done something right then. Okay. 

00:43:40
TRACI POSTINGS So as we have got a couple of minutes, but it sounds as if you have thought that's about time to stop. 

00:43:50
LUCY Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:50
TRACI POSTINGS How do you feel about us carrying on working together and -- 

00:43:55
LUCY Yeah. 

00:43:55
TRACI POSTINGS How – how does that feel? 

00:43:55
LUCY Um, I want to come. I want to come next week, yeah. Yes, it's mad isn't it. 

00:44:10
TRACI POSTINGS It's mad? 

00:44:10
LUCY I like it, but I don't. 

00:44:10
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:44:10
LUCY Yeah. But I can't explain it, yeah. 

00:44:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:44:20
LUCY Um, I felt a little bit of warmth actually. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
LUCY Yeah. And I've not – um, yeah actually. Since I've been here I've not run around. Um -- trying to fix thing that. You know what I mean. 

00:44:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:44:50
LUCY Fancying everyone I see. Eating chocolate and -- 

00:44:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

00:44:55
LUCY Okay. 

00:44:55
TRACI POSTINGS Trying all sorts of ways to just find some comfort. 

00:45:00
LUCY Yeah. 

00:45:00
TRACI POSTINGS And to feel special. 

00:45:05
LUCY Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I can see. 

00:45:10
TRACI POSTINGS Okay. 

00:45:10
LUCY But now I've got to wait a week to feel that normal. To feel normal. All right then. All right. Then I'll see you next week then. 

00:45:25
TRACI POSTINGS Okay. Thanks Lucy. 

00:45:25

Addiction is a primary, progressive chronic 

00:46:10
disease with genetic, psycho-social and 

00:46:10
environmental factors influencing its 

00:46:10
development and manifestations. 

00:46:10
The disease is often progressive and fatal. 

00:46:10
It is characterised by impaired control over 

00:46:10
use of the substance, preoccupation with 

00:46:10
the substance, adverse consequences and 

00:46:10
distortions in thinking.

TRACI POSTINGS My client Lucy, um, spent many many years as I've – as I've said, in very chaotic and very complex drug use. And so this would certainly come under the umbrella of substance misuse. However, I do not believe that Lucy's issue – although I don't like that word, is about substance misuse. And again, if I try and contextualize that, um, there are different patterns of drug use. And three of the most common, um, would be experimental drug use. Um, where people might try something because their friends are trying it. They might try something to rebel against something. And they might try something out of curiosity. Um, and that may well be the end of – of their – their drug experience. Um, there is another category which is recreational drug use. Which I guess the majority of people would put themselves in. Um, so this could be certainly alcohol would -- would come massively under the – under the banner of – of recreational drug use. Cannabis is known as a recreational drug. Whether or not that's true remains to be seen. And this is where in my understanding the drug use enhances life. It adds interest. It -- it adds enjoyment and pleasure to a life style. Then if we move on, there is dependant drug use. Where someone relies on and needs a – a drug in order to be able to function in life. Regardless of consequences to some extent. Now, Lucy -- out of the three Lucy would almost definitely present with a dependent drug use problem. However, I don't think that full captures the story. Lucy would describe herself as an addict. And although she was certainly dependent on substances. Actually many people, uh, and I've worked with such people and I've known such people present with a dependency on a substance. However, when that is worked through, they are often able to go on and – and live a, you know, live a life. Whatever that might be without any adverse consequences from their drug use. However, as you listen to the session you'll hear Lucy talk about other addictions, other dependencies on food um, on relationships. On drugs. Which would suggest that this is more than a dependency on drugs. And that this is somehow something to do with Lucy and her relationship with these things. And so, this is my understanding of addiction that the substances are simple a symptom of something that's used outside of the self to try and make inside feel better. And, um, I – I have some definitions, um, of addiction. And, uh, and the one I -- I like is by Morse and Flavin, and, um, it says, addiction is a primary, progressive chronic disease with genetic, psycho-social and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal. It's characterized by impaired control ove use of the substance. Preoccupation with the substance, adverse consequences and distortions in thinking. And this to me captures what addiction is. And I actually my personal belief is that it is a disease. And I would work from a basis of the disease model. Um, and when we think of disease we often think of measles or I don't know, some sort of infection or something. When actually if we break that word up, it's simple dis ease. The person is not easy. And is not at ease. And so, that certainly applies to addiction. Some of the, um, definitions are it's a chronic relapsing disease, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and drug use. And by neurochemical and molecular changes in the brain. And if we look at the origins of the word, it – it's a Roman word and it actually means slave. And the galley slaves in the – the big Roman ships, uh, were chained in the basement. And – and, uh, and forced to row. And they were called addicts. And, um, it actually means surrender to a master. And, um, and again something interesting to consider is what I'm explaining suggests that someone has no choice. If they're in the grip of an addiction. And yet there is a huge argument that says we all have choice. And – uh, and I would argue that. And – but I would hope that, um, the work – the work I do with Lucy, and the work and support that's available within addiction afford someone the choice. But I actually don't think that choice is – is available in the middle of an addiction. 

00:52:20
TRACI POSTINGS  A more personal definition, I guess, that I like of addiction, um, is it's never been able to get enough of something that you don't want. And when you listen to the session with Lucy I think that message comes across very clearly. And her life was really difficult and really painful. And yet she shouldn't' stop. So, in the end her addiction wasn't something that's been for pleasure. Um, it was done simply because she had not control over it. But possibly my – my favorite definition is that addiction is simply a desperate lack of love. And whether or not that's external love or internal love. It really doesn't matter. But I think that definition encapsulates exactly what addiction is.

TRACI POSTINGS Hello. My name's Traci. Um, I'm the counselor in the following session you're about to see. And I'm working with someone called Lucy. Uh, Lucy's come to counseling after many years of poly drug use. And um, and a life style that was incredibly chaotic and unmanageable. Um, alongside that, Lucy, um, as you will see talks about how difficult and painful her childhood was. And how that played a part in – in how her life unfolded. Um, before we move on to the session, um, I think it's important for us to understand, um, what I mean by um, complex poly drug use. And how that might differ from other types of drug use. And often the term, um, drug misuse is heard and substance misuse. And if we think about what this means it's quite interesting really in that um, if we break the word down, it's an abnormal use of something. Or it's misusing something. And I think it can become quite complicated when we begin to think of what actually is misuse of something. And actually a drug can take many forms. Um, I've got a couple of definitions here, actually. A drug is any chemical substance, synthetic or extracted from plant or animal tissue, and of known or unknown composition. Which is used as a medicament to prevent or cure disease. And that's Butterworth's Medical Dictionary. And, um, Collin's dictionary defines a drug as a chemical substance which is used for the effect it products. And when we just think of that simple sentence a drug can actually be many things. And -- first of all what springs to mind of drugs like heroin, cocaine, cannabis, and these are the drugs we – we hear about, um, when we think of substance misuse and drug misuse. But actually a chemical substance which is used for an effect can be many other substances. Um, substances such as caffeine, such as nicotine, um, alcohol, sugar. Um, all of these are substances that are used for an effect it produces. But can we really think of these as a drug. And, um, and alongside of that are these substances that can be misused. And I actually bring these into the equation because certainly in the states, um, the treatment centers and the rehabilitation centers where people go to detox from a substance and to – to try and find a recovery, often a turn the white powder treatment centers. Because it's believed that the most addictive substance is, um are white sugar, white flour and cocaine. And this might seem completely ridiculous that the – you know, to think of – of white sugar and white flour in terms of a drug. But when we think in this country of obesity, and heart disease, and um, the roll that food places. It actually begins to make a lot more sense. So actually, um, some think because they're not cures. And as innocent and as socially acceptable as food, can actually be misused. So could that be a substance misuse. Um, and if we think of alcohol, at what point does alcohol use become misuse. Is it after one pint, two, three. Is it after six pints. Or is it when someone drinks more than twice a week. Does that go from use to misuse. Or is it when someone drinks every day. Or is it when someone only drinks occasionally but when they do, they become very violent and very aggressive. Or get themselves in all sorts of trouble. And when we start to look at this, we can see that actually the line between use and misuse is not as clearly defined as we might think. And when we think of other substances there are so many issues around culture, around society, around economics, around politics, that – that make again the line between use and misuse very very, um, thin and wavy. So these – these are just things to think about. I'm not saying I have any of the answers to those. But something to think about.

TRACI POSTINGS In this session um, I'm working with my client called Lucy. And this is our second session together. Lucy has come to counseling after many many years of drug use. She's been through rehabilitation. And, um, is now, um, living an independent life. And trying to live her life without the use of drugs and without the use of alcohol. Um, Lucy talks about many difficult and incredibly painful issues associated with her childhood and with her drug use. And during the session she talks about things like being raped, um, being in prison, um, being physically abused and she also talks about an enormous amount of neglect in her childhood. And although these are incredibly um, important issues the focus on – on the session um, in some ways I didn't pick up on those issues. Because I felt it was important that Lucy was able to lead the way she wanted the session to go. But also although these things were incredibly traumatic and difficult it felt much more important for us to form an understanding. And for us to form a relationship. And a foundation upon which to build our work. And in many ways, as I've said I see addiction as a – as a relational issue. And that Lucy's relationships up until now have been with substances. They've been with um, drugs, they've been with alcohol. Um, and the relationships with people she's had have been incredibly incredibly abuse and dysfunctional. So in many ways, I'm meeting, um, it felt very important that – that we formed a platform, if you like, from which to work. 

01:02:15
TRACI POSTINGS As Lucy's life story unfolds, it becomes very clear that, um, it's been an incredibly traumatic life. And she's been wounded and hurt many, many times over. And in relation to our work, um, perhaps we can use, uh, an analogy of a house. And that if we image that Lucy her – herself is the house. And she sustained nothing less than a bomb blast, actually. And that, you know, the – the actual foundations of herself, the foundations of the house were rocked by her upbringing and her life style. And you know, the – the roof has been blown apart. The windows have been blown out. And it would be incredibly foolish actually to walk into a house like that to see what's going on. Because it's not safe. And so, in some ways the relationship I hope to form with Lucy would be like putting scaffolding up around the house. So the house is hold – is held and then we can begin to look at – at the parts of the house that need healing and the parts of herself that have – have been incredibly damaged. Um, by the trauma that she's been through. 

01:03:55
TRACI POSTINGS And so, our work initially will be about putting the scaffolding up around – around the house. And – and so, making it safe for her to be able to explore the fragmented and -- and wounded parts of herself. And will allow us to -- to work together. To hopefully find ways of -- of – of making the house livable in again.

01:04:50
 So, we're here today, um, to talk about your new DVD. 

01:04:50
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:04:55
 Just to provide with an introduction to it. 

01:04:55
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:04:55
 Um, and it's in three main parts. 

01:05:00
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:00
 You've – you've provided us with an introduction to uh, substance misuse and addiction. 

01:05:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

01:05:05
 And then you've got a session with you and a client called Lucy. 

01:05:10
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:10
 And then we've also got your commentary on that. 

01:05:15
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:15
  On that session. Your perspective as a professional taking a look at the different elements of the session and – and talking about them. 

01:05:25
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:25
 So, I was there when you did the filming of the session. 

01:05:30
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:30
 And um, I remember being very moved by this client. 

01:05:40
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:40
 Um, very – very effected, really. I came away feeling a lot of, um, a lot of sadness really for this person's life. 

01:05:55
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:05:55
 And how it had, um, how it had shaped. Really a very tragic life. 

01:06:00
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:06:00
 But at the same time it was also a sense of a new beginning. 

01:06:05
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:06:05
 Through the counseling. And that – that felt good too. 

01:06:10
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:06:10
 Um, I think it's a – it's an important piece of work. And I'm hoping that it's going to have a really positive impact out there in the world. Helping people to understand about the complexity really of people's psychological issues that – that lie beneath the simplistic label of substance misuse or addiction. 

01:06:35
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:06:35
 And also the complexity of working with that. And doing something meaningful in relation to a person's life. So that they can live a better life, really. This is not a simple thing. Um, and I'm hoping that it's – it's going to be watched. Not just within the profession but also from people who are wanting to find out more in health and social care about substance misuse and addictions. Is there anything you'd like to say about – just in terms of an introduction to the DVD itself, Traci. 

01:07:10
TRACI POSTINGS Um, I think – all I'd like to say is what I hope the DVD does capture, um, that drug use and substance misuse, um, is quite different from – from what we talked about in the session. And that often it's a very simplistic term. And, um, with a lot of judgment attached to it, a lot of stigma, a lot of misunderstanding. And what I hope um, that people – people watching the DVD, they will see the person, uh, with all their pain and their struggles, their hopes and their dreams and loss. Uh, beneath the umbrella term of addict. Um, and – and I think uh, Lucy's spirit and hope and courage shines through, um, throughout – throughout the film. And her desire to live differently. And – and her willingness to do whatever it takes to – to achieve that. 

01:08:30
 Yeah. 

01:08:30
TRACI POSTINGS Um, yeah. 

01:08:30
 Yeah, and I suppose when you say that -- 

01:08:30
TRACI POSTINGS  Um-hmm. 

01:08:35
 -- I just want to thank her for being on camera. 

01:08:40
TRACI POSTINGS Absolutely. 

01:08:40
 Because it was a brave thing to do. And, um, you know, a very personal opening up. 

01:08:50
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

01:08:50
 Of a very hurt person. 

01:08:55
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:08:55
 So I hope the people approach it with a tenderness and gentleness. 

01:09:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. Um-hmm. 

01:09:05
 That this client needs. 

01:09:10
TRACI POSTINGS And lacked. 

01:09:10
 And lacked, yes. And now needs. Will always need it. 

01:09:15
TRACI POSTINGS Absolutely. Yeah. 

01:09:15
 So thank you both. Thank you, uh, Traci for your work on this DVD and, um, she's not here but I'd like to thank Lucy as well. 

01:09:25
TRACI POSTINGS Absolutely. Thank you.

TRACI POSTINGS Hello again, Lucy. 

01:09:55
LUCY Hello. 

01:09:55
TRACI POSTINGS How are you today? 

01:10:00
LUCY Hmm. I don't even know. 

01:10:10
TRACI POSTINGS I don't know. Met for the first time last week and, you know, we talked about a lot of stuff, and, I think most of – you know, we were talking about, you know, your drug use, um, how dark life became then. And, um, and in a way although life is, you know, much better now that you're not using any drugs. But it's, uh, it's difficult. And, um, painful. 

01:10:45
LUCY Um-hmm. 

01:10:50
TRACI POSTINGS And that we looked at, you know, looked at some of the things that have happened in your life and I know talking about your mom's death and – and all the things that you went through. You know, during your active addiction. And -- 

01:11:05
LUCY Yeah. And you say, all right it's – it's better now. It is better but it's -- I – I just imagined that I'd stop taking drugs and – and my life would be all right. And the aim is just – it's really, really hard. 

01:11:25
TRACI POSTINGS And I know you said last week that it's really, really hard. And what does that mean. What -- what – what's hard, where's hard? 

01:11:35
LUCY Um, all of it really. I think life how -- how I'm supposed to – it's like I don't know what to do. Kind of like, all right, I'll just get up and I'll through the day. It just – it just doesn't seem easy. It's just such a – just stuck I feel stuck a lot of the time. It's like turmoil. It's -- 

01:12:05
TRACI POSTINGS Under turmoil. Something that – and you spoke of that last week. It's something that seems to be with you a lot of the time. And you also said last week about not being able to settle. Not being easy. 

01:12:25
LUCY It's like that all the time. It's just that I – it' like I just got to things. All the times I just got to do, do, do, do, do. And I try and go home and just sit down. And I have to clean up. And I can't even watch telly. And then I've got to speak to someone. It's just like when is it -- when is it just going to stop. Do you know what I mean. That – that's – this is how I feel. It's like when is it going to be all right. 

01:12:55
TRACI POSTINGS Hmm. When is it going to be all right or when are you going to be all right? Which one are we talking about? 

01:13:05
LUCY I don't know really. Um, will I ever be all right. I don't know. 

01:13:20
[sil.] 

01:13:25
TRACI POSTINGS There was something about that – that seemed quite tricky to hear as I said when will it be all right or when will you be all right. You really I don't know. How did that feel when I said that. Because you seemed to really like, hold up. 

01:13:35
LUCY Yeah. I thought that – that kind of threw me. I don't – is it it, is it me. Is it -- 

01:13:45
TRACI POSTINGS What is it? 

01:13:45
LUCY What is it, yeah. What -- 

01:13:50
TRACI POSTINGS What is it? 

01:13:55
[sil.] 

01:14:00
LUCY Yeah. I don't even know what it is. 

01:14:05
[sil.] 

01:14:10
TRACI POSTINGS But we keep saying it. As if it's a thing. 

01:14:15
LUCY Just hurts. It fucking hurts. 

01:14:20
TRACI POSTINGS In the first few minutes of the session Lucy begins by talking about difficult she's finding life now that she's not using drugs and alcohol. This is a real surprise to her. Because she really believed that her problem was drugs and alcohol. And that if she were no longer using these life would be okay. And she's having to face now that life is difficult. And that reality can sometimes be relentless. She talks about a disease and for me this personifies the disease of addiction. The restlessness and the discontent that she refers to. And she talks about it. And that the way she talks makes it difficult to know whether she's referring to something outside of herself or inside of herself. And she's really not sure just that it is horrible. And – and as she says at the end, it is really painful. And my understanding at this time is the it she speaking about is actually the fragmented, really frightened and really hurt little girl. Um, that she once was. And the part of her that carries all the trauma and all the horrendous things that have happened to her over the years. And the it is indeed, um, very painful. And very very difficult for her to – for her to contain. And if I think of – of addiction in – in different terms what I was thinking at that time is, the – although the life style she lead while using drugs and the lifestyle was awful, in some ways the drugs were like put in the hand, or a hand over the mouth of a three year old. And so, Lucy couldn't hear the horrendous cries of – of who she once was. And now that hand is in many ways removed – removed and the drugs are gone. That part of herself is – is very loud in some ways. And for me it was very important uh, at this point to be sure that – that – or to be sure as I could be that Lucy was able to engage in the work we would do. Because the risk is, of course, is if her distress were too great that she would chose to sooth herself with drugs. Um, or that – and it would be an unconscious choice. I'm not saying that she would go out and – and, you know, chose to use drugs. Because most of – of what happens is of course unconscious. But the – our work had to be safe and – and that together we could contain this part of her. And the outside of the session she would be able to have adequate support. And be robust enough herself to be able to hold this part of her. And I think I – I didn't say this at this point because I wanted to see how the session unfold and – and also how Lucy felt and thought about what – what her experience was. Being – being drug free. And it's something in you that hurts. 

01:18:35
LUCY Maybe. 

01:18:40
[sil.] 

01:18:55
LUCY I just wished it was all different, really. 

01:19:00
[sil.] 

01:19:05
LUCY You know, if – sometimes think like if my – if my mom never died would I have took drugs. Would I have ended up taking heroin. I don't know. Whether my brothers introduced me to it, would I have ever took it. if my upbringing was different would I be different and -- all right. And I rough it, but it just seems to be kind of no different. But different. Though I'm not in prison. And I'm not committing crime and – I think it's like I don't know what I was expecting, but I just want to be all right. 

01:19:55
TRACI POSTINGS And actually, it sounds as if a part of you is still in prison. Because you said, you know, I'm not – I'm not in prison but there's this. When's it going to be all right. When's it going – when's it, what is it and was it this and a searching and a trying to work it all out. And understand me, yeah. Okay, my life's much bad. But actually, to be honest it doesn't sound as if it's much better for a part of you. But, uh, the practicalities might be better. But part of you is still locked away, in prison. 

01:20:35
LUCY But so am I – how am I supposed to understand all that. That's -- 

01:20:35
TRACI POSTINGS  Yup. 

01:20:45
LUCY It's like that – is that what – I don't know. Is that why I've come here. Um, I just don't really understand you all really. 

01:21:00
TRACI POSTINGS So why do you think you came here? 

01:21:05
LUCY Um, to get -- to get some understanding of it. So I can get there, wherever I'm going. It's just endless. 

01:21:20
[sil.] 

01:21:25
LUCY I just sometimes think if my mom was still here would that make me feel better. If I'd a job would it be better. If I'd a boyfriend would it be better. It's just like anything – grabbing on to anything really to – just to make me feel better, really. 

01:21:45
TRACI POSTINGS Just something outside that you can take inside. And – and find some peace. 

01:21:50
LUCY Yeah. Just feel like – I can just fill that, um, it's like a hole. 

01:22:05
TRACI POSTINGS And nothing's filling it. 

01:22:10
[sil.] 

01:22:15
LUCY Even food. I just – I – I can eat and eat and eat and eat and eat. And then I just feel sick. And then I think you fat bitch. 

01:22:25
TRACI POSTINGS So then, there's this need that you – to keep eating, to keep doing something to get something. But then you really give yourself a hard time. 

01:22:40
LUCY It just didn't -- 

01:22:40
TRACI POSTINGS For needing something. 

01:22:40
LUCY Yeah. Just didn't fill up. 

01:22:40
TRACI POSTINGS It's a hole your bucket, Lucy. 

01:22:45
LUCY There's a hole in my bucket. 

01:22:50
[sil.] 

01:22:55
LUCY Yeah. 

01:22:55
TRACI POSTINGS You've mentioned your mom a couple of times. 

01:23:00
LUCY Um-hmm. 

01:23:05
[sil.] 

01:23:10
LUCY I don't know. I just think, um, would have been really nice – I've – do you know what. I think I get, um, I'll get jealous of other people. And they go, like, oh grandmamma moms. And I'll go like, oh. And it really kind of – so now that I'm grown up I'd like to have a relationship with her. But, it's almost again I'm never going to have that. Do you know what I mean. It's just – it's just not going to happen. And even if she was still alive um, she most likely tell me go away anyway. 

01:24:00
TRACI POSTINGS So that's -- 

01:24:05
[sil.] 

01:24:10
TRACI POSTINGS That seems at odds that your desperate to have this person, to have something to make it okay. And you want your mom. 

01:24:20
LUCY Um-hmm. 

01:24:20
TRACI POSTINGS And yet, there's also the – and it didn't sound like a fear. It sounded more like a – a maybe. That she'd tell you to away. 

01:24:35
LUCY Um-hmm. I thought she was quite harsh. And I – I just wanted to her to be nice to me, really. 

01:24:50
TRACI POSTINGS You wanted a mom. 

01:24:50
LUCY Yeah. 

01:24:55
TRACI POSTINGS You wanted one then and you need one now. 

01:25:00
LUCY This is that feeling of, um, I going to be all right, you know what I mean. You just want someone to tell you it's going to be all right. 

01:25:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. Comfort. 

01:25:15
[sil.] 

01:25:20
LUCY Oh. 

01:25:25
[sil.] 

01:25:30
LUCY So what do I do? Do you know what I mean, what am I supposed to do if -- 

01:25:35
[sil.] 

01:25:40
LUCY Did you know when I took gear and all that – that I didn't get this. I didn't get all this. And I just wasn't expecting that, um. I just keep getting overwhelmed. And I just get really, really sad. And -- 

01:26:00
TRACI POSTINGS Sounds like there's just nothing that can – there's nothing that you can find that can look after a little girl who wants her mom. And it's just too much for you to try and manage. But it sounds like the gear did it in a weird sort of way. That it was your mom for awhile. 

01:26:25
LUCY Yeah. Yeah. It kind of helped me. That -- 

01:26:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:26:30
LUCY It's something that we say. That there's – um, that'll hold me for a little while. 

01:26:35
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. That'll hold me until I get someone else. 

01:26:35
LUCY Yeah. 

01:26:40
TRACI POSTINGS And maybe that's what you are looking for now. You're looking for someone to hold you. 

01:26:40
LUCY Yeah. Now that makes sense. 

01:26:45
[sil.] 

01:26:50
LUCY I just – it's quite scary really. Because -- so this is – is this how it – it's kind of going to be. Because – constantly just trying to, um, make myself feel all right really. 

01:27:15
TRACI POSTINGS And also, it's blooming horrible because the fantasy was and the promise was you stop using and it'll be okay. And instead everything that held you together in a sense, it feels as if it's gone. 

01:27:35
LUCY Yeah. 

01:27:35
TRACI POSTINGS And what's so horrible is what was holding you together was killing you as well. 

01:27:45
[sil.] 

01:28:05
LUCY I don't – I don't know where I've gone. I just -- 

01:28:10
TRACI POSTINGS You said I don't know where I've gone. 

01:28:10
LUCY How long have we got left. 

01:28:15
TRACI POSTINGS We've got a little while. It feels as if so part of you had enough. 

01:28:20
LUCY Yeah. 

01:28:20
TRACI POSTINGS It's like, all right that's it. 

01:28:25
LUCY Yeah. 

01:28:25
TRACI POSTINGS I'll be off now. 

01:28:30
[sil.] 

01:28:35
TRACI POSTINGS As the session continues um, I like to think we begun to build on our relationship. And this helped us to explore further what it is. And this opened up to an emptiness she feels inside. Um, a hole. The absolutely nothing she does can fill it. And that she's looking outside of herself with food, um, perhaps trying to get a boyfriend. Trying to work. Or if, you know, thinking if I had this, if I had this, if I had this, then it would fill it. Um, but no matter what she pours into herself it's never enough. Again, this, um, highlights the, um, saying in addiction that, one is too many and a thousand never enough. But she just cannot, um, fill this almost bottomless pit insider her. And, uh, and I think our – you know, the humor we shed when – when I said about there's a hole in your bucket, Lucy. Actually enhanced our relationship. And – and I felt that we drew a little bit closer at that point. But that actually Lucy is facing trying to live a life in which she has absolutely none of the tools and none of the equipment that a good enough upbringing would have afforded her to – to – to negotiate life. Um, when she spoke about her mother initially, it was with a great yearning. But then actually when she began to look at the reality of that, her mother was really harsh. And that gives us a little view into a very lonely childhood is how I thought of it. But her mother would have told her to go away. And that what she was looking for was a mother. And, uh, interestingly, she spoke about the drugs holding her. And that now she's looking for being held in some other way. She can't find it. And – and again, one of the definitions of addiction that – that I spoke about earlier is that addiction is simple a very, very desperate lack of love. And as Lucy talks about her experience we can see that not only was there this enormous absence of love in her childhood, and also in her active addiction. But also that she's not able to give that love to herself. When she talks about eating and eating and eating, you know, trying to soothe that needy, needy frightened child that's inside her. That she calls herself a fat bitch. Because – because she's hurting. And so, the lack of love is not only outside of her, but inside of her as well. And in some ways, you know, she's looking for something to hold this part of her. It's almost you know, the picture I had was of someone having a colicky baby. Saying, look, look, you take this baby, for goodness sake. You know, will you look after. Please somebody take this baby from me. And, um – and the drugs held the baby for awhile. The possibly the relationships she had held the baby for awhile. The food, when she binges holds the baby for awhile. But actually the baby is hers to hold. And I think at this point not only doesn't she know that yet but also perhaps it's a very enormous undertaking for her. As we began to explore the part of her, there was a point when she said is – you know, how much longer have we got. And I think that – that actually for me that – that really fostered my hope that there was a – there was a part of Lucy that looked out for her. Because she was saying very clearly, hold on, I've had enough now. You know, that's enough. Oh, you know I'm – and, you know, I guess we were exploring the house that I spoke about earlier. You know together to look at what damage had been done. And – and what we needed to do to heal certain parts of her. And she was saying, you know, that's enough I've seen enough now. I want to – you know, I want to step back a bit. And so, that – and it's actually once I reflected on the session it's something that I wish I had not at that time perhaps but the – a bit later I'd been able to communicate to her – to her. To let her know that actually there is a robust part of her. But, uh, there is a part of her that can take care of herself. 

01:34:20
LUCY Yeah, so, yeah. 

01:34:25
TRACI POSTINGS Sounds a different part of you. Now, is that right. Thank you. 

01:34:35
LUCY Yeah. I don't know. I – just, uh, that's it. It's hard. It's almost like closed now. 

01:34:45
TRACI POSTINGS So, a little part that we see now that shift. And I'm mindful that you said you came here looking for answers, looking for – to sort it. And, uh, and maybe it's shifted against me who's not giving you those answers. I'm not telling you what the solution is. 

01:35:10
LUCY But will you be able to do that though. If I got to find it, fine, where do I look. 

01:35:20
[sil.] 

01:35:25
LUCY Yeah. Again, I thought, um, oh well that just shows me that everywhere I go expecting. I expect it from my mom. She never give me anything. Um -- 

01:35:40
TRACI POSTINGS And I was just thinking exactly that. That you come here with an expectation. 

01:35:50
LUCY Yeah. 

01:35:50
TRACI POSTINGS And I just join a long line of people that let you down. And I don't come up with the goods. 

01:36:00
LUCY So what do you do then. Why am I -- what is supposed to happen. Because it just sounds – is this going to be another way to die. I just know everything else is, really. 

01:36:20
[sil.] 

01:36:25
LUCY God, fucking hell. This is just -- 

01:36:30
[sil.] 

01:36:35
TRACI POSTINGS Sounds like it's pissing you off. 

01:36:40
LUCY Yeah. 

01:36:45
[sil.] 

01:36:50
TRACI POSTINGS And yet when I said it sounds like you're pissing – it's pissing you off. And I think what I meant was maybe I'm pissing you off. But you said, yeah. But as you said yeah, it sounded like you weren't pissed off any more. If that makes sense. Any sort of -- right now maybe it's difficult to be, don't know. You've had it with things. 

01:37:10
LUCY Yeah. I don't know. I don't – um, I don't know if – I don't know really. I don't know if I'm pissed off with you. I don't even know you enough to be pissed with you really. I'm just pissed off of it all really. With myself, with life. With – just got – I just can't get right out of that one. If I wished it was different. 

01:37:40
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:37:40
LUCY I just wished it was different. 

01:37:45
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. How would you have it, Lucy? How would it be? 

01:37:50
LUCY Um, I would have liked to have been special. That's part of life. To been, uh – to been shown some love and attention. I think more of attention then. You know, I remember being at school and, um, you know like the mom's used to come and take their kids, drop their kids off. And I used to have to go to school on me own. And, uh, you know, just that sort of envy like. Oh, well I wished my mom done that. You know, packed lunch. And pocket money and -- and be able to buy sweets in the morning and, yeah. Um, even my mom saying good night really. So you know what, and I just think this is, um, like even though she died it's almost I dream like it – um, I wanted it to be like that. But actually it won't. So it's hard to get out – you know, like people say to me, oh, was you close to your mom. And I go yeah. But I weren't. 

01:39:20
TRACI POSTINGS But you wanted to be. 

01:39:20
LUCY Yeah. And that's the – but it's almost like – because I've known – because I know I'm never going to have it. I could make it up as I want it to happen. 

01:39:35
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:39:40
LUCY And that is the reality. Like I said, it's – it's, uh – if I went to her now, she most say go anyway. 

01:39:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yup. 

01:39:50
LUCY So I can't – I kind of know that. But can't get out of that fantasy just to pretend it's -- 

01:39:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:39:55
LUCY -- it's all okay. Do you know what I mean. 

01:39:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And that you are special to her and you are loved. 

01:40:00
LUCY Yeah. 

01:40:00
TRACI POSTINGS And somebody comes to school and makes you a pack lunch and says na-night. Tucks you up. 

01:40:10
LUCY Hmm. 

01:40:10
TRACI POSTINGS And loves you. And loves you in a way so that you feel loved. 

01:40:15
LUCY Yeah. Just felt loved is good. 

01:40:20
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

01:40:20
LUCY By myself, do you know what I mean. She was actually quite frightening. 

01:40:30
TRACI POSTINGS So you were lonely and scared. 

01:40:30
LUCY Yeah. 

01:40:35
[sil.] 

01:40:40
LUCY I think that's how I felt at the time actually. 

01:40:45
[sil.] 

01:40:50
LUCY And again, I kind of, uh, I still pretend it's all right. And I know you're fine, you're fine. 

01:41:00
TRACI POSTINGS It's all okay. 

01:41:05
LUCY Yeah. But I still got that feeling there. It's just -- 

01:41:05
TRACI POSTINGS  So you've traveled a hell of a journey. And you've arrived at the lonely and scared loveless place. 

01:41:20
LUCY Yeah. This is what's – because I didn't know if this – I've been – I've been to prison lots of times. And I'm tough. I'm a tough cookie. And that's what's almost thrown me actually. Um, with my – this recovery, this is -- this is what's -- 

01:41:50
TRACI POSTINGS Now what you're expecting. 

01:41:50
LUCY No. I didn't know about, um, I didn't know but that's quite weird actually. Because, I could have said I didn't know what it was like to be lonely or scared. But I just said that. As a child I was like that. 

01:42:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:42:10
LUCY But I didn't know. 

01:42:10
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:42:10
LUCY I'd felt like that. 

01:42:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:42:20
LUCY So is this – this was what was supposed to happen. That, um, you give up the drugs and that comes -- 

01:42:25
TRACI POSTINGS Well this is what has happened. And that it's almost – what I'm – what I've been thinking the last few minutes is if you have ever heard the – the story of the little match girl. 

01:42:40
LUCY Oh. 

01:42:40
TRACI POSTINGS So have heard that story. 

01:42:45
LUCY Vaguely. 

01:42:45
TRACI POSTINGS She, um, is very poor and raggedy. And in -- in briefly she sells matches to try and get a few pennies. And the people that look after – look after her don't look after here. They're very cruel and she's not treated well. And, uh, and one winter is so cold that even though she's going get in trouble you lights a match. Just for a little bit of warmth. Just for a little bit of warmth. Just a little bit. But when she lights the match in the flame she sees what she remembers as her grandmother's house. And in the flame she sees a loving grandmother and a table with food and she sees a warm fire. Everything she's ever wanted. Then the match goes out. And she's too frightened then to light another one. But the next night when she's in the snow and the cold she lights a match. And she sees again everything she ever wanted in that flame. And it goes out. But this time she lights another, and another. And another. Until they're all gone. And it just reminded me if you're talking about gear and – and drug use that – for that time you didn't feel. You didn't know about the fear and the aloneness. And the terror and misery. Because the promise was in the flame. But that's gone. The matches are all burnt out. 

01:44:15
LUCY And this is it now. 

01:44:20
[sil.] 

01:44:25
TRACI POSTINGS However, I'm also very mindful of a few minutes ago you said, but I'm tough. What's this. What's this, I'm tough. And you see, I believe the little girl. Absolutely. But I also believe the tough part or you wouldn't be sitting here. 

01:44:55
[sil.] 

01:45:05
LUCY But I don't know if I can handle this – this part. This is -- 

01:45:10
TRACI POSTINGS It's too heavy, too much. 

01:45:15
LUCY It's kind of like, it's quite easy to be tough. 

01:45:20
[sil.] 

01:45:25
LUCY I kind of like her, um, the toughness is wearing out really. 

01:45:30
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:45:35
[sil.] 

01:45:40
TRACI POSTINGS And there's nowhere to hid. There's no drugs, there's no – there's no matches. There's no matches. 

01:45:45
LUCY Yeah. 

01:45:50
TRACI POSTINGS And the pain is so deep. And the wound so raw at the minute. It's like oh, my god what are we going to do with this. 

01:45:55
LUCY Yeah. 

01:46:00
[sil.] 

01:46:05
TRACI POSTINGS As the session unfolds, Lucy really begins to get in touch with the really frightened, lonely part of herself. And she begins to – to almost separate fantasy from reality. She yearns very desperately to be special. And to have someone care for her. And she puts her mother in that role as someone who would care for her and, you know, someone she had a really great relationship with. But actually she knows that that's not true. And as the session unfolds, more and more of the reality of her relationship with her mother, um, is opened. In that her mother would probably tell her to go away if she did approach her. And then her mother was quite harsh. And that finally she was quite scary actually. And Lucy for the first time acknowledges that as a child she was very frightened and very lonely. But that even as a child she hadn't acknowledged this. That she locked that part of herself away somewhere. And the image I got was again of – of Lucy's house. And that we're now beginning to look in the rooms that have been – that have been very badly damaged. And that have been locked up for a long time. And we just beginning to open the door. And finding out whether the floor is safe enough to stand on. And to be able to go in. And – and once we're in we can begin. We can begin the journey of healing. And it was during this period and just before when Lucy began talking about her mother, that I felt really moved by what she was talking about. And – and I believed this was for two reasons. Initially, I believe that the – the – you know, I was really with Lucy. At this time. And that in the face of such unbearable suffering. And the awful experiences she went through. But on a very human level I found that very moving. But also on a personal level in that Lucy's feelings and Lucy's experience touched on that part of me – the wounded part of myself that although you know, our experiences weren't exactly the same I believe I know that place within myself. And, uh, and I believed that that – during that part of the session we became closer. And perhaps you know, Lucy felt able to be pissed off with me. A little. Only a little. But, uh, she became a little frustrated at, you know, what am I here for. What do you do. What's the point of – of this. Have you got the answers. Who's got the answers. And, um – and actually what we were doing was just building our relationship. And, um, getting to know each other. Building a rapport. And that felt to be the most important thing. And I felt that when I told the story of the little match girl that actually I was talking to a very little girl. And it reminded me of almost of a mother telling a bedtime story to a child. And, uh, but that actually it's a very sad story. Because all the special loveliness that Lucy wanted was in the light of the flame. And that, uh, each time it went out her hopes were dashed. And that -- and it was during this – this phase of – of the session that there was a hopelessness. And a real fear in Lucy of like, oh my god, if this is how it is then, so this is how it is. What am I going to do. This is just I can't bear this. How am I going to live like this. And I believe that at that time I held the hope. Um, and was able then to bring in to the session that yes, you know, this part of her is – is deeply hurt. But there is another part. It's the part that survived out on the streets. That it's, uh, a tough part. And that although this tough part is now tempered in a way by this very wounded frightened child part, that that part still exists. And towards the end of – of that clip it felt very important that when Lucy said what am I going to do. That I responded by what are we going to do about this. And I would hope in some way that was the beginnings of a relationship that could heal. Rather than the false hope that I would have given her if I'd have been telling her what she could do and what she should do and what this was, and what that was. And trying to be ever so helpful. That may have looked as if I was offering help. But it would have been – it would have been a false help. And a false hope. And the only person that would have felt any better for it would have been myself. And so I felt that just being able to stay with Lucy and for her to be able to be pissed off with me. And for her to be able to be frustrated with the whole process, um, was more beneficial for our relationship and for our work. 

01:52:55
LUCY  So what do I do then? 

01:53:00
TRACI POSTINGS Well, what are we going to do about this. 

01:53:05
LUCY Well you tell me because you're the therapist. 

01:53:10
TRACI POSTINGS What does she need? 

01:53:15
LUCY I don't know. Need a match. 

01:53:25
TRACI POSTINGS And the match always work. The bit of gear always worked. But actually every single time without fail it abandoned you just like everybody else did. 

01:53:40
[sil.] 

01:53:45
TRACI POSTINGS And I'm sitting and wondering if the trick is to find one of them, have a lighted matches. 

01:53:50
LUCY Yeah. That'll be good, wouldn't it. Yeah, just like will it ever, um – you know what she see in the match I can see what you're saying. Will I ever get to that – is life um -- well I can only say it's like if I light – would that match become real. 

01:54:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. 

01:54:25
LUCY Do you know what I mean? 

01:54:25
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. 

01:54:25
LUCY Or is it just going to be wishing. Wishing, wishing. 

01:54:30
TRACI POSTINGS And more fantasy. 

01:54:30
LUCY Yeah. 

01:54:30
TRACI POSTINGS And more pretend and more illusion. 

01:54:40
LUCY Because that's what we said all right. Now it's – I'm going to – when I leave here in a minute I'm going to just go like, oh hello, yeah I'm fine. 

01:54:45
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

01:54:50
LUCY And pretend. 

01:54:50
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:54:55
LUCY And just do whatever I can. 

01:54:55
TRACI POSTINGS To get through the day. 

01:55:00
[sil.] 

01:55:05
TRACI POSTINGS I'm wondering, you know, that part, the survivor usually goes about and says, hello are you all right, what you doing, yeah. And that's a laugh and – and, you know, the tough bit. Did that part of you bring the other part here. 

01:55:20
[sil.] 

01:55:25
TRACI POSTINGS To be able to be with thee. Just the awful emptiness. 

01:55:30
LUCY Um-hmm. I don't know. I just came. 

01:55:35
TRACI POSTINGS Um-hmm. Looking for answers. 

01:55:40
LUCY Yeah. 

01:55:40
TRACI POSTINGS That you're not getting. 

01:55:40
LUCY Yeah. 

01:55:45
[sil.] 

01:55:50
LUCY All right. So, like how many times have I got to see you? Another five times. 

01:56:00
TRACI POSTINGS And it's, uh, it's like we've got right into your head. Felt okay. I need a chart now. Do six of these and three of them. 

01:56:10
LUCY And then -- 

01:56:10
TRACI POSTINGS And four of them and it'll be all right. 

01:56:15
LUCY Yeah., Then it'll be all right. 

01:56:15
TRACI POSTINGS And it feels very different in here then we were talking about the feelings. When we were talking about – when we were talking about the hurt. We become quite business like. 

01:56:30
LUCY All right. Um, yeah, but still – I still -- 

01:56:40
TRACI POSTINGS How much longer. 

01:56:40
LUCY Yeah. So can you not tell me that? Can you not, um – you ain't got the answers. Have I got the answers. 

01:57:05
[sil.] 

01:57:15
LUCY Oh, it just seems all too hard again, though. 

01:57:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And it feels really heavy at the minute and – and what – what do we do. 

01:57:25
[sil.] 

01:57:35
TRACI POSTINGS And yet what really – and I was going to say what really strikes me, which is really interesting after talking about matches. But, as you said what you were looking on, looking for a match, actually since we've been talking although life is harder, Practically it's much better, but you're in so much more discomfort and disease since you've stopped taking drugs. I haven't heard you say, I want to go and use something. I want to go and use drugs. I've heard you say you want your mom. But I haven't heard you say, I've had enough of this I'm going to get -- 

01:58:10
LUCY I can't. I can't. I used for so long. Um, I've tried to stop so many times. I'm sick of smoking crack, being raped and sick of prison. And I've tried to stop loads of times but what happened was, I got, um, I got sick of the drugs. 

01:58:40
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:58:40
LUCY And – and I used – when I used to score, I used to – it used to be in my hand and – and – there's alike a famous walk, like, you got the walk on. Because you know that the smoke. And I lost it. 

01:58:55
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

01:58:55
LUCY And, so that – yeah. I just – I – I don't feel like smoking drugs. But I just want to feel all right. 

01:59:05
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. You'd had enough of that. 

01:59:10
LUCY It didn't – it stopped working. It stopped doing what it said on the tin for me. 

01:59:15
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. And so there's an ending there. And here we are in a – okay. That don't work. But you're in a place that don't work, we're not there yet. And this middle place of well, what will work, what do I have to do. 

01:59:35
LUCY Okay. Okay. 

01:59:40
TRACI POSTINGS It's between a rock and hard place really. It's really difficult. 

01:59:45
LUCY Yeah. But you know, that's kind of making me feel good a bit. Because I didn't think that I wasn't – that I would have been thinking of using. So I'm not thinking of using. So that's got to be a good thing, isn't it. 

02:00:05
TRACI POSTINGS You're looking for comfort and you're looking for ease and you know, do I get a job. I want mom. I want – you're looking for something. 

02:00:15
LUCY So have I got to get that, though. 

02:00:15
TRACI POSTINGS Now what did you say you wanted to feel special. 

02:00:20
LUCY Yeah. 

02:00:20
TRACI POSTINGS You wanted to feel special and you wanted to feel cared for. You wanted to have somebody make you a packed lunch. 

02:00:30
LUCY Yeah. Hmm. 

02:00:35
[sil.] 

02:00:45
LUCY Oh. Sounds quite silly. 

02:00:55
TRACI POSTINGS Silly? 

02:00:55
LUCY Someone – I want someone to make me pack lunch. 

02:01:05
TRACI POSTINGS But to go to school all nice and clean and nice uniform, nice clothes. Your pack lunch in a little box, wrapped up nice. Instead of the picture I got of the little girl you said, just went in there old how, with no body to say good bye. Nobody to make breakfast. 

02:01:20
LUCY Yeah. And I – do you know what, this is – this is what I get. Because that ain't going to happen anymore. That's past. That's -- 

02:01:30
[sil.] 

02:01:35
LUCY So this is where I get angry. Because it's like, um, I want all of that but it's gone. It's gone. Do you know what I mean. And that's -- because I suppose all right. That's where I'll go with my mom. I want it. I wanted it. But then I get, well you never bloody gave it to me. 

02:01:55
TRACI POSTINGS And it's too late now. 

02:02:00
LUCY Well, it's too late now. What if, what, if, what if, what if, what if. 

02:02:05
TRACI POSTINGS  If only. 

02:02:10
LUCY Yeah. 

02:02:10
TRACI POSTINGS Maybe. 

02:02:15
LUCY So that's kind of what goes on. Do you know what I mean. What – again looking back at the girls at school. I wonder if they – I wonder about their life is. Do you know what I mean. If they became normal. You know what I mean. 

02:02:35
[sil.] 

02:02:40
TRACI POSTINGS Or if they walked through hell like you have. 

02:02:45
LUCY And it's really strange what you're saying. Because I – it's like the life – if I – if I told someone about my life the crack houses, being raped, being beaten up, fighting, going to prison. Saying it like that sounds quite awful. But to me it was normal. 

02:03:10
TRACI POSTINGS Yes. Exactly. And it's like when you spoke of being little. You weren't aware of the loneliness and the emptiness. Looking back it was like, oh, that's what it was like for me. 

02:03:25
LUCY Yeah. And I didn't know that then. 

02:03:30
[sil.] 

02:03:35
TRACI POSTINGS And there's something so – it's so awful, Lucy. About those terrible things being normal. Being, you know. Just how it is. As we moved into the later stages of the session, I was – I was very mindful that Lucy spoke about some really awful things about being raped, about fighting, about the crack houses, about going to prison. And she'd mentioned these earlier in the session. And there was a part of me thinking I wonder if she, you know, she's wanted me to pick up on one of these. But actually I think this was just – I do think it was more important for us to stay on building our relationship and for me to get to know this wounded and frightened part of her. And for her to be able to give that part of herself a voice. And that felt the foundations for our work. And I certainly would guess, you know, that if Lucy wanted to bring these other events to future sessions, then of course, there'd be things we could – we would work on. But was really startling actually, was how normal these events were in her life. When just one of these events for – for some people would be incredibly – it – it would be a life changing horrendous, um, atrocity. Actually. But for Lucy it was a way of life She didn't talk about, you know, this terrible thing happened she was raped. She spoke about the rapes, the fights, the prison sentences, the crack houses. So these weren't singular events. This was a lifestyle. And I think it's very important for me to acknowledge although this was normal for Lucy and this was her experience, that that does not take away from the horrendous impact it had on her as a person. Because I think it would be easy for me to fall into the trap of thinking, of yes, this was just her way of life. When actually all of these things stand alone as terrible things to happen to a human being. And I think it's important for me to remember this. Um, as we just moved into that part of the session I did make an intervention where I asked Lucy um – I – I wondered, um, whether the very street route wise, um, tough part of her brought the wounded child to counseling to be healed. Now although I actually – I actually still stand by that statement. I don't believe it was the correct thing to say in this session. Um, I believe it was a bit gargony(ph). And that it would have made no sense to Lucy. So it made sense to me. But it didn't make any sense to Lucy. So therefore it -- it didn't really – it wasn't really helpful. Although I do like to think that on an unconscious level she – she heard what I was saying. Um, but she very beautifully said, I don't know I just came. So, uh, which was – which was lovely. Um, as we move to the later part, of the session Lucy was I felt beginning to – beginning to realize actually that the answer was with her. That there was no one going to come along and make it better. No one was going to come along and tuck her up in bed. No one was going to come along and put what had happened right. And, uh, it was done and it was gone. And actually there was the beginnings of her realization though it may not be fair, but the – this is her legacy. In some ways the legacy of her past and the work she needs to do in order to recover and – and live a – a life with some joy. I actually found it quite interesting when Lucy spoke about um, the – in a sense the drug stopped working. And – and this came after I'd – I'd noticed actually that the – although she was in tremendous pain and really struggling to cope, um, on – on her day – in her day to day life. She hadn't mentioned wanting to use drugs or go back to her old lifestyle or – that hadn't been mentioned at all. And – and although she said that the drugs had stopped working and I think to a certain extent that's true. I think they had stopped being able to soothe her. They had stopped being able to placate her, to calm the disease. I also like to think of it a different way. In that perhaps the screams of that wounded child was so loud now that they needed to be heard. And didn't need to be covered up any more. And that there was a deeper part of herself that realized that Lucy was at a place where she access the support, the information and the caring she needed in order to do the work she needed in order to heal. 

02:10:15
LUCY  So like, what -- try to become to be normal. 

02:10:25
TRACI POSTINGS So you want to be normal. 

02:10:25
LUCY I want to be normal. I just want to be normal and have me packed lunch and go to work and someone to look after me. And have a dog. 

02:10:40
TRACI POSTINGS Who's going to make the packed lunch now? 

02:10:45
LUCY Now? Um, well I suppose I'll have to at the moment. I don't know. So I've got to do this then if I -- 

02:11:00
TRACI POSTINGS  Got a bit of the bread, chose the filling. 

02:11:10
LUCY Yeah. 

02:11:15
TRACI POSTINGS Don't sound like it's what you wanted to hear. 

02:11:20
LUCY No. Not really. Because it's still not someone taking care of me. 

02:11:25
TRACI POSTINGS And it don't feel enough to take care of yourself. It's like – it's needing an outside person to feel special to somebody. 

02:11:35
[sil.] 

02:11:40
LUCY Um, I don't think I know how to take care of me self. That's -- yeah, well that's a bit, um, that's kind of hit home a bit. 

02:11:55
TRACI POSTINGS  It's difficult to know how to do something if you've never been taught. 

02:12:05
LUCY Yeah. 

02:12:05
TRACI POSTINGS Or never seen it done. 

02:12:10
[sil.] 

02:12:20
LUCY Oh, I just go into -- just seems too much. 

02:12:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:12:25
LUCY Too much. 

02:12:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:12:25
LUCY And again, it fucking sounds so silly because to make a packed lunch, to buy a bit of bread, seems hard work. 

02:12:35
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. Yup. And it is. Because it ain't a bit of bread. I mean it is a bit of bread. But there's so much more in it. 

02:12:50
[sil.] 

02:12:55
LUCY It's all mad stuff. 

02:13:00

TRACI POSTINGS Start talking about prison and drugs and the awfulness and we end up talking about a pack lunch. 

02:13:15
LUCY Yeah. Yeah. That's just mad because I could – I feel like I can handle that life. 

02:13:30
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. You know how to suffer. 

02:13:40
LUCY I know I just -- 

02:13:40
TRACI POSTINGS You know how to survive. 

02:13:40
LUCY -- to survive. Survive, yeah. 

02:13:45
TRACI POSTINGS But you're just learning how to live. 

02:13:45
LUCY  Oh, okay. Yeah that – um. That sounds nice. But actually the thought of it is if this is life, if this is -- 

02:14:10
[sil.] 

02:14:20
LUCY It's quite strange the – the hole seems to be a little bit gone for a minute. 

02:14:25
[sil.] 

02:14:30
TRACI POSTINGS What's filled it Lucy? 

02:14:30
LUCY Don't know. 

02:14:35
[sil.] 

02:14:40
LUCY You know what even – even maybe someone just bloody listening to me. 

02:14:45
TRACI POSTINGS That sounds as if anybody ever has. 

02:14:45
LUCY No. 

02:14:50
[sil.] 

02:15:00
LUCY No. I don't think they have really. Um, but hey, yeah, hey. All right we got – we finished in a minute, aren't we. 

02:15:15
TRACI POSTINGS Not far from – we've got about five minutes. But again we got to a wow, that's enough of that now. Thank you. 

02:15:25
LUCY I'm all right now. 

02:15:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yup. So, but actually you know, it's interesting. I think earlier on it was like, woo, don't think much of this. I'm off. But actually we are coming up to time. And considering you said I don't know how to look after myself it's all new. There's a part of you that saying hold on a minute have I got – I'll go back into the world in a minute. Back into all right, how you doing, yeah, I'm fine. So I need to, you know, I need to be less vulnerable. 

02:15:55
LUCY Okay. 

02:15:55
TRACI POSTINGS Then you have been in times here. Which is looking after yourself. 

02:16:00
LUCY Oh, okay. Oh, so I've done something right then. Okay. 

02:16:10
TRACI POSTINGS So as we have got a couple of a minutes, but it sounds as if you have thought that's about time to stop. 

02:16:20
LUCY Yeah. Yeah. 

02:16:20
TRACI POSTINGS How do you feel about us carrying on working together and -- 

02:16:25
LUCY Yeah. 

02:16:25
TRACI POSTINGS How – how does that feel? 

02:16:30
LUCY Um, I want to come – I want to come next week. Yeah. Yeah, it's mad isn't it. 

02:16:40
TRACI POSTINGS It's mad? 

02:16:45
LUCY I like it but I don't. 

02:16:45
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:16:45
LUCY Yeah. Like I can't explain it. 

02:16:45
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:16:50
LUCY Um, I felt a little bit of warmth actually. Yeah. And I've not – oh yeah. Actually. Since I've been here I've not run around. Trying to fix that thing, do you kwon what I mean. 

02:17:20
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:17:20
LUCY Fancying everyone I see. Eating chocolate and -- 

02:17:25
TRACI POSTINGS Yeah. 

02:17:30
LUCY Okay. 

02:17:30
TRACI POSTINGS Trying all sorts of ways to just find some comfort. 

02:17:35
LUCY Yeah. 

02:17:35
TRACI POSTINGS And to feel special. 

02:17:35
LUCY Yeah. Yeah, I think. Yeah, I can see. 

02:17:45
TRACI POSTINGS Okay. 

02:17:45
LUCY But now I've got to wait a week since – to feel that normal. To feel normal. 

02:17:50
[sil.] 

02:17:55
LUCY All right then. All right then I'll see you next week, then. 

02:17:55
TRACI POSTINGS Okay. Thanks Lucy. 

02:17:55
LUCY All that's all right. Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Should I come, uh, the same time. 

02:18:05
TRACI POSTINGS Same time. 

02:18:10
LUCY Okay. Will you be here? 

02:18:10
TRACI POSTINGS I'll be here. 

02:18:15
LUCY Okay. All right then. Thank you. 

02:18:20
TRACI POSTINGS Thank you. There was some quite important things that happened as we came up to the end of the session. We'd spoken about earlier in the session when Lucy went to school and her friends had a packed lunch. And that she didn't. And that how much she wants to be normal to have a – a dog and a job and a – and a packed lunch. And -- and as we looked at that Lucy came to realize that there was nobody who was going to make the packed lunch for her. And that, you know, she had to – she would have to if she wanted a packed lunch make it for herself. And it almost felt to me that during that part we were just planting very gently planting some seeds of self care. And this is something very frightening for Lucy. As she said she prefer going to prison then – then having to make a packed lunch for herself. Um, because actually we weren't talking about a packed lunch. We were talking about her taking responsibility for herself and for her life. And for her own wellbeing. And that is a – a monumental undertaking for someone who has never – who's just not equipped to do this as yet. And I think that that was quite difficult for Lucy. And – and a reality and a truth, uh, she really didn't want to accept. But within that there was also a realization of the role or of the place our relationship could have in her life. Which would perhaps signify the other such relationships would be possible, in future times. And – and what she said was, that the – the hole is a little bit filled. Which would suggest – it would suggest actually in some ways that I took on the role of the match. Or even the role of heroin. But actually I would hope in a more functional loving way. But what I would hope that my role did was to be able to be with that frightened wounded little girl. And what Lucy was able to say after that was perhaps it was simply being listened to. And what – although I had listened to the tough part of her and the strong part, the survivor part. I'd also heard the voice of a child that had never been able to verbalize experience before. And I think that was what perhaps helped her feel soothed a little. And as we move closer to the end of the session and talked about, um, our continuing work, Lucy said that she liked it but she didn't like it. So, and that to me was saying although it's painful walking – walking through this abandoned old house that – that's you know been falling apart around my ears. Although it's painful, it's also nice to be heard. And it's also maybe she felt special just by simply having some attention. And some warm affection. And, um, and as we walked together through the house, perhaps this hope that one day it would be a home. And I also felt that we did end the session about five minutes early, but it felt very important to me to let Lucy have control over that ending. Because she's had so little control of anything else in her life. And that for me to put faith in her ability to care for herself and to know that, hang on a minute, I've got to go out in the street I need to – you know, I need to get back into my survivor self. And, um, be ready to face the world. I felt it was very poignant the last comment that Lucy made. After we had ended and checked times and sessions and went to the nuts and bolts. Where she asks me, if I'd be there the next week. And I was able to answer, yes, I'll be here. But what I heard was a very tiny little girl looking for reassurance. And – and looking for the hope that – that someone could be there for her. And not abandon her as all of the people that were meant to care had. 

02:23:35
Summary 

02:23:40
[sil.] 

02:23:45
TRACI POSTINGS From the work so far, um, with Lucy, I believe that we have formed a relationship. And I certainly felt very close to Lucy at times during that session. And during our initial session. And I believe we have, um, a good foundation to build and – and develop, uh, our relationship. I see much of our work is hearing – much of our work together is me being able to hear and us together being able to bear the pain, the woundedness and the hurt that Lucy has suffered throughout her life. I think it's important that together we're able to in some ways bear witness to her experience. And – and also that Lucy has another person in that alone and empty place. I think as Lucy's journey into recovery continues there are many things she will – she will possibly want to look at and want to heal. But I think it's important for us to keep it in the day and in the moment. And just focus on us being together. And for me being able to understand, um, to understand Lucy. But most importantly to be able to hear um, to hear her – to hear her truth. And for me that is the essence of our work together. 

02:25:40
The importance of the 

02:25:40
client-counsellor relationship 

02:25:40
TRACI POSTINGS  I do believe that the relationship, um, that Lucy and I formed during that session and during our initial session is vitally important. Um, for our future work. And I do feel, um, that Lucy felt understood by me and listened to. Which was also very important. And I don't see our relationship as a treatment approach. I don't see that I will be doing anything, calling forming Lucy of anything. I feel that we're going to be working together. And we're going to be working together so that Lucy can find a way but those two parts of herself we've identified that can come closer together. And that she will be able to make a packed lunch for herself. And I think that Lucy did come to the session, although I don't think she realized it. She came to the session with hope. And she also came to the session with a motivation to change. She was very clear that she was unhappy with the way things were. And that the very fact that she came to counseling, um, signifies that she hoped that this were possible. And it felt that during the session she lost this hope and she lost the motivation. And it was at that point that I needed to hold the hope. And it was at that point that I needed to believe that – that she were capable of changing and living a fulfilling life. And – and it reminded me of a really old saying I hear years and years ago. And, um, it was about a – an old sociology, um, experiment. And what it said was what the teacher believe the student achieves. And when I work I like to translate that to what the counselor believes, the client achieves. And if I sit believing that – that Lucy situation is hopefully and she might as well give up after having such a horrendous past. Then I will be communicating that. Even if I do it – don't do it in my words, that will be communicated in our relationship. When actually I don't believe that. And I do believe that – that change is possible. And – and that Lucy can have a fulfilling life. And, for her as well, that really desperate wounded part, I need to be – and I remember reading a book by Simington at some point about being able to bear the screams of a terrified frantic child. I need to be able to do that. And I need to be able to bear the terrified screams of my own fragmented part. Because if not, I won't be able to bear listening to anyone else's. And if that were the case, it would be at that point I would be pulling back away from Lucy. And perhaps offering advice and suggestions about what she should do. Changing the subject or stopping listening. Which is why I think it's been incredibly important for me to have been on my own journey of healing and of recovery. And to be able to be with that part of myself in order to allow me to be present with – with that fragmented part of Lucy. So, I do see Lucy's recovery as a journey. And I hope we can walk a good part of it together. And that Lucy has as lot of healing to do. But she actually also brings a robustness to the work. This street part of her I absolutely believe will see her through. And the fact that she were able to be with both parts of herself in the session is – is quite phenomenal. And she did that without any drugs. Without any alcohol, with no chocolate with – there was certainly no boyfriend in the room. So together we were able to hold that part of her. And if we can do that, that is proof to her and to her internal world that it's possible.
