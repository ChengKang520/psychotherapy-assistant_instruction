AIPC Presents Counselling Therapies Session 4: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Okay Marsha. So, um, how how can I help you today? 

00:00:00
MARSHA Well I'm working full time. I'm a part time student. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:00:25
MARSHA I've just gotten engaged and I live at home . There's just so much stress in my life. I've everything happening all at once. Just to top it all off, I failed an exam, a really big exam and I just feel like I can't do anything anymore, I can't do anything right. I've just got so much stress and I feel like such a disappointment, such a failure and I've embarrassed my family by failing. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:00:50
MARSHA You know, I just don't know what to do anymore and I, I guess I've come here to today to tell you like, I, I wanna leave Uni. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. 

00:01:00
MARSHA And I guess that's why I've come to you today. 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN Okay. So it sounds like a whole lot of stuffs on top of you at the moment? 

00:01:05
MARSHA Yeah, just so much just all piling on, yeah. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, stressing you out? Hm hm. So you are working full time plus... 

00:01:15
MARSHA Part time study. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Um, part time study. 

00:01:15
MARTHA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN And then you've got your, eh, wedding preparation. 

00:01:20
MARSHA Yeah, just got engaged and wedding's just a month away now so... 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) A month? 

00:01:25
MARSHA Yeah, so I've just got so much happening. Work is really demanding. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:01:30
MARSHA And yeah, just failed this exam. It's just, yeah, I don't know what to do. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) All too much. 

00:01:30
MARSHA All too much. 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. So I imagine you've been, um, sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head? 

00:01:40
MARSHA Yes, it's just been building up and building up and so much pressure with everything and I'm living at home so my parents... 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:01:45
MARSHA You know a lot of pressure, need to do everything right and. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:01:50
MARSHA Yeah and by failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them and I just don't feel like I'm good enough you know to go on studying. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Okay. And, um, have they said much to you about failing an exam? 

00:02:05
MARSHA Uh, they haven't said much. Uh I was actually really scared to tell them actually 'cuz I knew they's just be so disappointed and just embarrassed by the fact that I did fail. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. 

00:02:15
MARSHA Yeah, I've never failed anything before and... 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:02:15
MARSHA So yeah, it's... 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:02:15
MARSHA Really hard. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. So it's new and and, and you don't like it at all. 

00:02:25
MARSHA Not at all, no. And I think leaving Uni will just be the way out just so I don't have to go through it again. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Okay. Right, okay. Well I'm glad you've come to counseling because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate and, um, we're confused as of what to do and our emotions can get in the way and you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuffs on your plate. 

00:02:50
MARSHA (crosstalk)Yeah, a lot of things yeah. 

00:02:50
UKNOWN Okay. So, um, I'm glad you've come here. Um, here at the clinic, uh, we use the ABC model which is a, um, cognitive behavioral therapy model. 

00:03:05
MARSHA Okay. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN So Marsha, um, some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use and we don't realize that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. 

00:03:15
MARSHA Okay. 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN Um, here's the list here. Have a look through that. 

00:03:20
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN To see if there are any beliefs that, um, you might be operating on at the moment. 

00:03:25
MARSHA Um, I think number two. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:03:30
MARSHA Umm. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Read that one out for me. 

00:03:30
MARSHA That it's necessary to have a higher degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. You mentioned the earlier didn't you? Yeah. 

00:03:40
MARSHA Um, number four, that it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's an expectation from your family. 

00:03:50
MARSHA Yeah, um, possibly number eight. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:03:55
MARSHA Um, that life should be entirely pleasant and enjoyable and that any frustration, discomfort or pain would be unbearable. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Mm, mm yeah. Which one of those, um, stands out the most for you at the moment? (crosstalk inaudible 

00:04:10
MARSHA Um, probably number four. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:04:10
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. How would you put that in your own words? 

00:04:15
MARSHA That I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:04:20
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Yeah and is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment? 

00:04:25
MARSHA Uh-huh. Well, failing that exam I mean ,I wasn't successful with that so yeah. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:04:30
MARSHA I mean it just throws out, I guess even number two because it throws out all the order in my life I, I need to have everything ya know... 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:04:40
MARSHA So I need to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. Yeah so... 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Hm. Okay. So if, if number four is an expectation that your family have and that you have of yourself, how do you measure up next to number four? 

00:04:55
MARSHA I don't feel like I'm good enough. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. 

00:04:55
MARSHA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Well what I'd like to do is, is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along. 

00:05:05
MARSHA Okay. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Okay. So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment? 

00:05:10
MARSHA Um, I mean there are a lot of things, but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. 

00:05:20
MARSHA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN And, um, and the consequences you thinking of leaving... 

00:05:25
MARSHA (crosstalk) Of leaving Uni, yeah. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Okay, all right and, um, and that statement that you made earlier, about I'm not good enough... 

00:05:30
MARSHA (crosstalk) I'm not good enough, yeah. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's, that's the B one, that's the crucial one and I'll explain it... 

00:05:40
MARSHA (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Uh, shortly when I get up to the board. 

00:05:40
MARSHA Okay. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN All right. Okay I think I will put it up there now for you so we can uh, work through that 

00:05:45
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN So Marsha the activating event... 

00:05:50
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Which is what you stated earlier. 

00:05:50
MARSHA I failed my exam. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is? 

00:06:05
MARSHA Leaving Uni. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN That's right, yeah. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Okay, so it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that, um, you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. And you've mentioned earlier that , um, number four seems to fit and... 

00:06:35
MARSHA (crosstalk) Uh-hmm 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN You've put that in your own words. What were your words before? 

00:06:40
MARSHA That I'm not good enough. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, good. 

00:06:45
[sil.] 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN That's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking. 

00:07:00
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Okay Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board... 

00:07:10
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN And what I'd like to do now is , um, focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking, looking at it from another point of view. 

00:07:20
MARSHA Okay. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Um, to me it sounds like you've, you're doing a whole lot of things really well. Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well? 

00:07:30
MARSHA Um, I'm working and it's a really demanding job and I'm, you know, keeping up with it so... 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Mmm. Great, yeah. 

00:07:35
MARSHA I guess work. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:07:40
MARSHA Um, things with my fiance, I mean, we're engaged so... 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Uh-hmm. 

00:07:45
MARSHA Planning the wedding... 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Hmm. 

00:07:45
MARSHA That's, that's going really well. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:50
MARSHA It, it's stressful but it's going well. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. 

00:07:50
MARSHA Um... 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN And all of your other university subjects? 

00:07:55
MARSHA Yeah, I've never failed anything before. This is the first one so... 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Mmm, Uh-hmm. 

00:08:00
MARSHA I guess all the other subjects, yeah. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. And you're succeeding in all of those things. 

00:08:05
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Put together. 

00:08:05
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN You're juggling it and it, it's a lot on your plate at the moment but it sounds like, um, you've been able to cope up until this point of the, the one exam. 

00:08:15
MARSHA Yeah, this one just threw me off balance. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Hmm, hmm, hmm. 

00:08:20
MARSHA Yeah just failing it. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN So, uh, would you describe yourself as successful most of the time? 

00:08:30
MARSHA Yeah, most of the time. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:30
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN And what's the evidence for that? 

00:08:35
MARSHA Passing all of my exams all the time. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:35
MARSHA Uh, just passing my subjects, not just exams.... 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah, that's right, yeah. 

00:08:40
MARSHA Um, getting that full time job. It it's a great job that I'm doing, yeah 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:08:45
MARSHA Um, getting married. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's right. 

00:08:50
MARSHA (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. So, how do all of those successes compare to that belief that you've written, that I've written on the board for you? 

00:09:00
MARSHA I guess, in comparison, I am good enough. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right, yeah. And all the evidence is there. All of the subjects that you've passed in first year and now second year. 

00:09:10
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Um, your, um, full time job, that's a success. 

00:09:15
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN That's great , yeah good. Okay, well what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board. 

00:09:25
MARSHA All right. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN To dispute that belief, okay. 

00:09:30
MARSHA (crosstalk) Okay, yep. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Would you do that? 

00:09:30
MARSHA All right. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Well done Marsha, that's a powerful statement. 

00:10:00
MARSHA Mm-hmm. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN What kind of decision goes along with that? 

00:10:05
MARSHA Staying at Uni. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Good, okay. Write that on the board for us. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Great, that's good. 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Good, okay, so you've made a bit of a decision there haven't you? 

00:10:35
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Tell me about it, does it feel okay? 

00:10:40
MARSHA Yeah, I, I feel like I should stay. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Okay, why is that? 

00:10:45
MARSHA I can try again. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right. 

00:10:50
MARSHA I mean everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Good, good yeah. 

00:10:55
MARSHA (crosstalk) So, I mean, I could re-sit the exam. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Okay, yeah, yeah and we've talked about all your successes. 

00:11:00
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN So it's hard , um, now to believe that top statement, that I'm not good enough. 

00:11:10
MARSHA Yeah, I mean I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize . The, all the successes that I've had. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:11:15
MARSHA I am good enough. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Yeah good, okay. And so this idea about staying at Uni. 

00:11:25
MARSHA (crosstalk) Yeah I'll stay. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Tell me about that. 

00:11:25
MARSHA I mean, I am good enough so I'm sure I can give it another go and, and see how I go from there. I can re-sit the exam and I'm sure I'll be fine. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Okay, good, okay. What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement, I am good enough... 

00:11:45
MARSHA (crosstalk) Uh-hmm. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Say it in front of the mirror, two or three times a day, um, so that you build up your confidence because it's going to take some time to re-program your computer up here. 

00:11:55
MARSHA Yeah. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN With that kind of positive belief about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief and, um, we tend to carry those other beliefs, uh, for years and years and years and so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. 

00:12:15
MARSHA Okay. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN But, um, you've made a great start here today so congratulations, well done. 

00:12:15
MARSHA (crosstalk) Thank you. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:12:20
