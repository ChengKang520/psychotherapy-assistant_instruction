00:00:05
Levette Dames Carlos Zalaquett SeriaShia Chatters 

00:00:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Welcome to a Demonstration of Counseling using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with an older adult from a diverse background. Seria help us understand. What is the demonstration about today? 

00:00:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well today, we will be viewing a case of grandmother Tita who was a 74-year-old Bahamian woman who was recently fallen and broken her hip. Unfortunately, grandmother Tita has just found out from her physician that he has recommended that she be transitioned into long-term care due to her inability to take care of her-- of herself. Grandmother Tita would like to live with one of her children however, that is not going to be possible. So now she is facing the reality that she is going to have to leave her home to which she had lived independently, and transition into a Long Term Care Facility. Today, we will be utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapeutic Techniques to help ease grandmother Tita into this transition and release some of her fears of anxiety. 

00:01:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, transitioning to a Long Term Care Facility is an important issue. Levette help us understand. What type of different facilities grandmother Tita can have access to? 

00:01:30
LEVETTE DAMES There are two basic types of facilities, independent living, assistant living supervised apartments for old adults as well as living facilities for old adults with limit, with small amount of, uhm, supervision. But they do have 24-hour medical care facilities available for the older adults. 

00:01:50
Levette Dames Carlos Zalaquett SeriaShia Chatters 

00:01:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Wonderful to, to know that and what are the common fears older adults may have of transitioning into an older adult facility? 

00:02:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS The top three fears that older adults face when transitioning into living facilities are, first of all, a loss of independence. Most older adults are used to living on their own, they have not ever had to face living in the facility to which they have to be supervised or assisted. The second, uhm, fear that most older adults experience is living in a medical facility, because many assisted living facilities have 24-hour medical care to which they are consistently around doctors and nurses. This sound be very frightening when you are moving from your home to an environment that is very hospital-like. Third and, and lastly, one of the top three fears that older adults face are financial difficulties. Moving into these facilities can be very expensive, many drain older adult savings, and can leave them in very desperate type of that desperate situations. So these are the top three, uhm, issues that older adults face when transitioning in a long-term care. 

00:03:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT When we deal with older adults, ah, sometimes we need to, uhm, understand the background and the diversity of their background. And in this particular case, I think that one of the element that, uhm, was introduced is the concept of, uhm, using spirituality as a way to help grandma Tita. Can you help us understand a little bit more about that? 

00:03:30
LEVETTE DAMES Well, in the Caribbean, spirituality and religion is a very important aspect of one's life, especially older adults. So therefore, grandmother Tita has noticed that you-- we wanna use her spirituality and her religious activities to help her facilitate an easy transition into these different, uhm, facilities. So, we'll utilize certain religion ritual such as praying, reading her Bible, and even attending church to assist her with easy transition into these different Long Term Care Facilities. 

00:04:05
Levette Dames Carlos Zalaquett SeriaShia Chatters 

00:04:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT As you can see the idea of working with older adult is an important one, it a population that is growing in the United States and in the world, and it's also important to consider issues of diversity in working with older adults. Like in this case, working with a person from the Caribbean or Caribbean area as we define it. So I hope you will enjoy this demonstration of CBT application that we provide for you today. 

00:04:40
Facts about older persons • Types of living facilities • Independent living-partially supervised apartment or senior housing • Assisted living-nursing home with 24 hour medical care. • About 5% live in nursing homes; About 25-30% end up being placed in nursing homes. • Thoughts of having to move to a facility increases stress and fear. • Fear of being "put away" • Losing independence • Living in a medical environment • Financial difficulties 

00:04:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So interesting facts about older persons in the United States is currently approximately 5% older persons are living in Long Term Care facilities. However, before the end of their life, approximately 20-30% of older adults could be transitioned into Long Term Care facilities. Merely the fact of having that having to transition to a Long Term Care Facility can induce stress and anxiety in the older person. Additional concerns are the fear of loss of independence, living in a medical environment, and the feeling that they are being put away by their Family members. 

00:05:15
LEVETTE DAMES Now, we're gonna have ah, uhm, start off with our, our (inaudible ) and Seria is gonna introduce our (inaudible ) to us. 

00:05:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Our first (inaudible ) is going to cover some of the issues discussed within the initial session. In the initial session, the therapist will cover several thing. First, they will orient the client to the Cognitive Behavioral Therapeutic Model. Second, they will do a case formulation. And third, they will do a case conceptualization. Within the orientation of the Cognitive Behavioral Model are... 

00:05:45
LEVETTE DAMES We'll be building a therapeutic model, also we'll be discussing the CBT Model. And now, we recognize the multi-cultural origin of the client. 

00:05:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Often in the case formulation, the therapist will develop the problem list, prioritize the problem list. And also discuss that problem list with the client. And finally, in the case conceptualization, the therapist will develop a working hypothesis. They will also develop and set treatment goals, and develop a treatment plan that will be discussed with the client. In our very first (inaudible ), you will be viewing the therapist developing a problem list, prioritizing the problem list, and also discussing that problem list with the client. 

00:06:25
LEVETTE DAMES Before we go into that, we wanna give you a little idea of who grandmother Tita is, and we're gonna have to read, read of, of, a very introduction of grandmother Tita.

Grandmother Tita would like to live with one of her children, she has two sons and one daughter, however, none of her children are able to provide the care she needs. Grandmother Tita reports feeling worried about leaving her home permanently. She is afraid of the long-term care due to what she has heard about the long-term care conditions from some of her friends. She has been having problems sleeping due to nightmares about living in the assisted living facility, complains about neck and back pain, and shortness of breath. She complains that when she thinks about moving, her heart beats fast, she breaks into a cold sweat, and she experiences dizzy spells. When asked, if she has experience or received previous treatment, grandmother Tita reports seeing her pastor on a weekly basis. She reports spending many hours with her pastor as she try to make her decision to transition. Her pastor recommended that she see a counselor when she started complaining about issues related to anxiety. She is skeptical of the therapeutic process. However, she has come to therapy after being encouraged to attend by her children.

And then they have their life, you know, they didn't grow up like I grow up in the Bahamas, but, you know, I, I've wanted to live with them but I know they have their life to live. So, this is what I am really, really consider about living. I just wanna get over this, all my heart, my heart. Yes. 

00:13:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS All of those feeling that you're talking about grandma Tita, have you heard of anxiety before?

GRANDMOTHER TITA (inaudible ) cuz you were good. My chest, my kidney, my everything was good, everything was good. So I know I have a good feeling health. 

00:14:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, what you're having is some of those feeling of anxiety. 

00:14:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:14:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And then you're also having feeling like your children are kind of putting your away because where you came from, in from the Bahamas - 

00:14:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:14:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - this wouldn't happened. But it sounds like since you've been in America for so long that your children, kind of, ah, ah, as you say acting more like Americans. 

00:14:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:14:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. So grandmother Tita, the next step that we do now that we've kind of written down the problems, is I wanna kind of read the problems that I've written down. 

00:14:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:14:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm, your problem list. So at the top of your problem list, I had it sounds like a loss of independence. 

00:15:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:15:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Just as you say you don't want anyone else to take care you. 

00:15:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, I, I tell you I've been taking care of myself, and like-- I told you my husband died 20 years ago. I've been taking care of him until he die. I've been taking care of myself. I wash, I clean, I do everything for myself. 

00:15:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. And you said all of those things you're independent woman. So having to move into his nursing home facility, you felt like it's gonna take some of your... 

00:15:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes, such a big thing, you know. 

00:15:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, okay. And I, I-- then everything that I've heard definitely with heart and the shortness of breath and that you have some, some feelings of stress and anxiety that are a problem. 

00:15:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:15:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And then we also have in here that you have a fear of, of your, your children, putting you away. 

00:15:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Yeah. Uhm. 

00:15:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And I understand that. Though that's definitely, ah, a huge, you know, and it is very understandable especially knowing where you come from. 

00:15:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:15:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS All right. And then also, you said, you're having some-- a lack of sleep - 

00:15:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:15:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - and some nightmares. 

00:15:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uh-hmm. 

00:15:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. All of these are, are issues that all relate to anxiety. 

00:16:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:16:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Believe it or not. And so, these are, are very common issues especially for anyone who is transitioning to a nursing home. So I want you to understand that these feelings, it may feel like you're by yourself, but there are lot people that feel this way when they're transitioning. So, I want you to understand that. You know even, even though you may feel that, you know, you're different, you're not, you are the same with a lot of people that have this happen because this is something that is very stressful. 

00:16:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:16:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. So the next thing we're gonna do is put these-- we're gonna prioritized it, we're putting into what you feel is the most important. What we do, we're gonna deal it first. 

00:16:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:16:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And I'm going to ask you some questions, but I will also cop-- provide some suggestions in between. All right? 

00:16:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:16:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, you keep saying about the heart, you wanna take care of this heart thing and the, and the breath. And I, I definitely feel that those are things that we should, you know, pay attention to first. So, uhm, at the top, what do you think about is putting there those feelings of, ah, stress and anxiety? 

00:17:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA I, I, I am. I think that I should go to the top, but the first thing, I mean, the first thing is the-- in the-- that, that, thinking of people doing things for me I, as a-- what you call that independence? Taken away. 

00:17:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:17:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. I, I think that's my first thing I won't put on that is... 

00:17:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So you want that to the top (inaudible ). 

00:17:22
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah, cuz, yeah, that's, that's, that's a big thing. I mean it. Like I say. I, I can't, I don't know. I can't ima-- oh, I can't imagine that. 

00:17:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, we're gonna put loss of independence to the top. 

00:17:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:17:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because if we can, we can work on, you'll feel a little bit better that transition in a long-term care. 

00:17:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:17:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And may be it would decrease some of those feelings of stress and anxiety, and, ah, the heartbeat. Okay. So, then, so we'll say a loss of independence first. 

00:17:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:17:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS The stress and anxiety. 

00:17:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. And I want (inaudible ) 

00:17:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And then at the third, the loss of sleep. 

00:17:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:17:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because sleep is very, very important. 

00:17:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:17:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But you said that you were sleeping after the news. 

00:17:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:17:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS All the way up to five o'clock in the morning. That's a lot of sleep. 

00:18:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, and I get up and pray. 

00:18:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes, yes, and you, you get to pray immediately after that. 

00:18:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:18:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, we're going to put that sleep, getting that, getting that sleep, your sleep patterns back to normal as there... 

00:18:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:18:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Is that good? 

00:18:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes. 

00:18:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And then you have, said you have these feelings of being put away. 

00:18:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:18:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That fear of, of being put away. So, we're gonna deal with those fears next. Okay. And then, uhm, lastly, you're saying that your relationship with your children is that you feel as if they are acting differently. Then, you would have acted if you were-- were you did act as a matter of fact when you're in Bahamas. 

00:18:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, cuz, yeah, I know, you know, like I said, they, they grow up like Americans, you know. 

00:18:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:18:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA They didn't grow up like me in the Bahamas and all of that. But I try those, try those some of the values, the good, back then. But like I said they lived here for (inaudible ) and I don't know anything else. But, uhm, so I could-- I just don't understand, you know, them thinking about, you know, being in the States and what people do. So, you know I, I still don't understand, mean it-- sometimes it hurt me, but I still don't understand. 

00:19:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, you, you told me about your children, and I, and I feel you are attempting to understand how they view things. It sounds like you feel like you maybe a little bit of burden to them. 

00:19:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes, sometimes. But sometimes I feel like I, I really don't wanna be a burden, or no burden. I mean, in like I say when my husband died, you know, it was only us two for a long time. But you know, and I tried to do as best as I can. I love my daughter. She really, she really was trying to do what she can. And I tell you my two sons they live in another state. 

00:19:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:19:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm, one of them in Neb-- Nob-- Neb-- Nebraska, I think it's as Nebraska.

SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. It's a long way away. 

00:19:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, and, they really a little distance away, but they, they tried to do their best. And like I say they got their lives. 

00:19:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:19:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA They got everything else. But, you know, I, I tried-- I don't wanna be a burden. You know so... 

00:20:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So since you said, it was just you and your husband. It doesn't sound like you have a lot of other friends or other people around you to support you besides your kids. 

00:20:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, I tell you, I tell you about my pastor, and I tell you... 

00:20:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:20:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. My pastor and some of the members from the church too. They, they really call me and they're really a good supports, some of the pastors. And then I had an old friend years ago, she died, now she had, uhm, uhm, sugar, you know what sugar right? 

00:20:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm, diabetes. 

00:20:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes. She had a sugar. Yeah. And for two years she died. And she was in a nicer home too. You know, looking at that day, I really sort of a little, you know, hesitant. But I have a lot-- one, two, but a lot of my friends, they die. You know, they go on (inaudible ) Yes, sometimes. 

00:20:46
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Okay. 

00:20:46
GRANDMOTHER TITA Now, that I have the Jesus with me. 

00:20:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Oh, Jesus is with you all the time. 

00:20:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. I have him with me. But a bit little lonely sometimes, but, ah- 

00:20:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So we're gonna put loneliness on there. And what we mean by that, is the problem is that, it's something that we can working on building your support system. 

00:21:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:21:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS As well. Okay. 

00:21:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Okay. 

00:21:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So now, we've develop the problem list and the kinds of put things in order. And I'll discuss it with you. We are going to be moving on to another part of our session here pretty soon. Okay? 

00:21:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uh-hmm. 

00:21:15
CBT Session Case Conceptualization Identification of Underlying Schema Development of Working Hypothesis Development of Treatment Plan 

00:21:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS An important note when working with older adults is the fact that you may have to break the initial session into two parts. With grandmother Tita, a large part of our session is explanation, or orient-- orientating her to the Cognitive Behavioral Therapeutic Model. So, in the initial session what we worked on was an orientation to the CBT Model and also the case formulation. In the next session, we will work on an important component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called the Ca-- Case Conceptualization. During the Case Conceptualization, a therapist would develop a working hypo-- hypothesis, develop treatment goals with grandmother Tita, and finally develop the treatment plan. In this next (inaudible ), you will see the therapist work with grandmother Tita in developing treatment goals. 

00:22:00
Treatment Goals 

00:22:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, grandmother Tita, now that I'm giving you a little bit more information about what I think was going on. And I'm glad to see you back and you're kind of updated me on how your week has been, the next thing that we are going to do, is we are going to work on setting some goals for our time here. Okay. 

00:22:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Okay. 

00:22:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS We wanna make sure that while we're here that we are working towards taking care of any of the problems that you had told me before last week were some of the biggest problems that you were having with this transition to the nursing home. So grandmother Tita, the first problem that you told me, because last week we worked on not only getting those problems together, but tell-- you told me which one is the most important to you. And you said one of the most important ones was you're feeling as if you have a loss of independence. 

00:22:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Oh, yes. I tell you that, that I, I, I, I, I used to do things for myself I already tell you that before. So that was one of the big, oh, that's one of the biggest problem. Biggest, biggest one. 

00:22:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah, and I definitely understand that grandmother Tita. So, what do you think, you know, if we're looking that loss of independence, what do you, what do you like one of your goals to be? 

00:23:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, I think I wanna be able to do at least most of the things for myself. 

00:23:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:23:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Then I go into the-- that, that, that the home. 

00:23:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:23:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA At least most of the things, uhm, you know, I know that I have to be like doing cooking, and maybe this and that. But all, at least most of the things, I will do for myself. 

00:23:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:23:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:23:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. So we-- you want to be able to still be able to do a lot of things for yourself even though you're moving into this house. 

00:23:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm, uhm. 

00:23:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So what we, what we can do is we-- a goal of our treatment could be to definitely help you look into different types of Long Term Care Facility. 

00:23:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:23:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because I don't know if you know, but not all Long Term Care Facility require that you be under 24-hour supervision. 

00:23:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Okay. Okay. That's the good thing. 

00:23:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. So... 

00:23:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. That's the good thing. 

00:23:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, you may be able to do some things for yourself. 

00:23:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:23:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So we'll set that as a, as a goal to help you to be able to do more things for yourself. 

00:24:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:24:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And what I'm going to say is decrease your, your fear of that loss of independence. 

00:24:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. Yeah. That's a good one. Yeah. 

00:24:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Sounds good? 

00:24:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA You know how to put it down. You've been to school. Uhm. 

00:24:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Now, the second thing that we are going to talk about grandmother Tita is that you don't really know what to expect - 

00:24:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:24:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - when you go to this, this nursing home. 

00:24:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:24:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And so what I wrote it down is the fear of the unknown. And not just like not knowing anything, but just not knowing what this nursing home is going to be like. 

00:24:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:24:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So what would you like to-- how do you think that we could work towards decreasing that fear of, of not knowing that fear of the unknown? 

00:24:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, uhm, you know, I've been living in my house years and years. 

00:24:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:24:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA So, I know that house inside out. So, maybe if I get, you know, uhm, maybe go and visit. 

00:24:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:24:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Maybe before so I could, you know, get a little uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, what the word? Is, uhm, used to. 

00:25:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:25:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA You know, the, the areas maybe where they cook, where they do this, where they do-- to meet some other people. 

00:25:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:25:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Look at the surroundings. So I could feel a little more, you know, what ease? 

00:25:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Yeah. 

00:25:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA I'm not having to just put me right there, you know, we're right down at the sand there, you know. 

00:25:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. Right. 

00:25:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA I wanna be-- maybe to go and see it. And see how everything is. Not I say it's okay, now I, I tell I've been there, and, and look okay. But I really wanna see it for myself. 

00:25:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. Right. 

00:25:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. Uhm. 

00:25:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That's, ah, I mean that's an excellent goal there. The first goal, we're looking at is, we're gonna decrease that fear of the loss of independence by looking at the different kinds of Long Term Care Facility. 

00:25:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uh-hmm. 

00:25:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But in the second thing, so that you have a little bit more of an idea where we're going, - 

00:25:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:25:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - of where you're going - 

00:25:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. Uhm. 

00:25:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - excuse me. I wish I could go there to help you out - 

00:25:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Oh. 

00:25:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - but you know... 

00:25:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA No, you're still young, you're still young. 

00:25:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes, yes. So, what we-- what we're gonna do though is we are going to look, have you visit once you've chosen one. 

00:26:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Make sure that you visit, and, so that is a really good goal. 

00:26:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So a goal to make sure that you visit to help to decrease that fear. 

00:26:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. That I think, ah, that will help a lot, cuz you know you got to know where you're goin', you know. 

00:26:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:26:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes. You got to know. 

00:26:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Now, knowing where you're going that kinda helps to make you feel a little bit more comfortable about it. 

00:26:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. Uhm... 

00:26:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Much I totally understand. All right, so our next one here is to-- you said the-- that you we're having some issues with nightmares. 

00:26:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And you also said you're having the heart palpitations, - 

00:26:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - heart palpitations and the shortness of breath. 

00:26:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Now, the interesting thing and, and the reason why normally as a therapist, because these are, are physical symptoms that you're having. 

00:26:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I would have put them more towards the top of the list. But you told me that you're having them at the same time when you're talking about these - 

00:26:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - different nursing homes. And, and you're thinking about losing your independence. 

00:26:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:26:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So it's very important though that we pay attention to those things. And so, something that we are going to, we're going to work on together. And this is the goal. I know I've been, you know, asking you questions about it. 

00:27:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:27:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And this is the goal that I think we should work on together as helping you to learn how to relax. 

00:27:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:27:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Helping you to learn how to calm your-- yourself down when you're thinking about these things. 

00:27:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:27:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But I think that the three goal-- the two goals that we just talked about which is looking at the different types of places, and then going to visit - 

00:27:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uhm. 

00:27:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - may help with the heart - 

00:27:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:27:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - and the shortness of breath when you think about it. 

00:27:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA I, I think so too. 

00:27:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because you'll know more about where you're goin'. 

00:27:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uhm. 

00:27:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, there's something in, in therapy that we call short-term goals and long-term goals. And the short-term is what we wanna do right now. 

00:27:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Okay. 

00:27:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And the long-term is what we're gonna do over time. Okay? 

00:27:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:27:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, what-- which of these goals that we've look at the-- looking at the different types of a Long Term Care Facilities and we look at visiting the ones that you choose, that you think are going to be more what you wanna go to. 

00:27:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:27:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And then we look at learning how to relax. Which one of those things do you think that you want to do first? 

00:28:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS You need me to repeat it again? 

00:28:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. I'll repeat it. 

00:28:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Oh, yeah. We'll get down... 

00:28:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And we're... 

00:28:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:28:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS In, in order to help you a little bit more, - 

00:28:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - I'm gonna give you this. You ha--did you bring your reading glasses again grandmother Tita? 

00:28:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA I have them, them on, this is my reading glasses. 

00:28:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Those are your reading ones? 

00:28:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:28:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. I, I've seen you change them... 

00:28:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA No, no, no. This, this is my reading ones. 

00:28:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. All right. So here's your reading glasses I think you're, you're using. 

00:28:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Okay. 

00:28:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So the first thing up here is we are looking at-- the first thing we are saying that we are going to look at the different types of Long Term Care Facilities. 

00:28:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS The next thing is we are going to choose one, and visit it. 

00:28:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And then, the, the next thing here is to help to learn how to relax. 

00:28:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay, for relaxation. 

00:28:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:28:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So which thing do you think that you should do first? 

00:28:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. You think the relaxing one? 

00:28:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS You think the relaxing one? 

00:28:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA I know, I-- that will help me with the, with the, with the, with the heart - 

00:29:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:29:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA - heart problems. Yeah. 

00:29:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Learning how to relax? 

00:29:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And how soon do you think that you would be able to, uhm, actually, with your daughter, look into some of the different types of Long Term, Term Care Facility? 

00:29:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, we could do that. I mean in, I'm the old woman. 

00:29:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:29:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA I don't do much, for one thing, I, I could, I could-- I maybe could go tomorrow. 

00:29:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:29:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA And I know she would be able to say, "Okay, let's go tomorrow." So, maybe we could go to look at the same(ph) place. 

00:29:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:29:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:29:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA We could look at the, at the... 

00:29:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS We're gonna look at the different types first. 

00:29:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. 

00:29:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:29:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm, uhm. 

00:29:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And then choose which one you want to - 

00:29:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:29:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - think are the-- your best places to go. 

00:29:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uhm. 

00:29:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And during that time though, we can be working on relaxation. 

00:29:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it. 

00:29:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I like that. I like that. 

00:29:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. But when I look at, - 

00:29:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS What do we got here? 

00:29:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA - when I look at those, the, the, the places - 

00:29:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:29:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA - it help me feeling that ease, I know, you know, ah, I know I've been like, I said I've been here before when I visit my friend. 

00:30:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:30:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA But I wanna really see a design on them, can mean no prettiness just show me. Where the beam, my room and everything so I can know how to feel, and I'll feel much relax. I might need to do that relaxation thing no more after I see that. But, anyway, we can-- we-- I'll tell my daughter, and I know she can take me tomorrow. 

00:30:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:30:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Cuz she one or two places in mind already. 

00:30:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:30:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA So, we could go there. 

00:30:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So wanna see them? 

00:30:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah. Uhm. 

00:30:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Most of that-- but grandmother Tita, we're, we're gonna talk a little bit more about the relaxation. Cuz relaxation is something that's good for you to do even when you, you transitioned into whatever Long Term Care Facility you go to. 

00:30:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:30:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, we're, we're-- would you-- do you agree if we should keep that as one of the goals? 

00:30:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-ha. 

00:30:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay, we will keep that as one of the goals. 

00:30:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:30:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. And finally here, we have-- we were talking about the fact that your husband has passed away. And that, you didn't-- your friend has passed away in the, in the nursing home due to diabetes or sugar. 

00:30:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uhm. 

00:31:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay? And you said your two sons are in Nebraska. 

00:31:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:31:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Your daughter is the only one down here. 

00:31:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:31:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS You said she works. 

00:31:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:31:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, you-- we were talking about you've been a little bit lonely. 

00:31:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:31:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. So one of the goals, I'm looking at, I mean, I'm, I'm thinking about-- after thinking about your case for little bit is, is building a little bit more social support. 

00:31:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:31:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Do you know of any places in your community where either you heard your, your friends have used to go to or you used to go to that you can meet more people? 

00:31:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, they have a commodity-- more community centers right down the road for me. 

00:31:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:31:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Where they have like, you know, that all are, are, uhm, adults? 

00:31:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:31:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA They, they go there and they have people there who, you know, you played game, bingo. Oh, I love bingo! 

00:31:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Bingo. 

00:31:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA We play bingo, and, you know, we just talked - 

00:31:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uh-ha. 

00:31:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA - then we talked with the old-time. I used to go there a lot. Me and my husband used to go there a lot. 

00:31:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:31:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA You know, but as I say I was by myself, I, I just didn't feel like, ah, much like that. But I can maybe start going back there, even to meet some people and then I can tell them I changed. 

00:32:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:32:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA You know I, I go to all-- we always have little, little fare and little thing, and people always come to pick me up. 

00:32:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm. 

00:32:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA So, I, I, yeah, I think that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a good thing, we, we can do that. We need to... 

00:32:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That's a wonderful idea grandmother Tita, - 

00:32:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Hmm. 

00:32:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - because I looked into your community, and see if there's anything near where you live. 

00:32:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uh-hmm. 

00:32:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And you're absolutely right, there is an AB-- ABC Community Center -

00:34:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:34:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Your second goal is to decrease your fear with the unknown - 

00:34:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:34:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - by actually visiting some of the Long Term Care Facilities, and seeing where you would be-- where your room would be. How-- what type of care they ta-- doing of the patients, different things like that? 

00:34:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm.

00:34:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:34:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And your fourth goal is going to be for you to increase your socialization and go to the Community Center after we leave the session at least once. 

00:34:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:34:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So we're going to be increasing the amount of time that you talk to other people that are similar in age to you.

00:34:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay? 

00:34:45

00:34:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, what do you think about those goals? 

00:34:45
GRANDMOTHER TITA They sound good. They sound great. I'm so, so excited, excited to do at least the last one. Cuz I haven't been there for a long time.

00:35:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm.

GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm, uhm. 

00:35:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS To help you with this places...

00:35:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS She sure do, she sure do. Yeah. 

00:35:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA And she was really under, under the term, but, ah, I don't think that would be a problem.

00:35:30

And you're going, we're going to be learning how to relax here. And also at the same time incorporating some scripture as well.

GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:36:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Finally, after you transitioned to the Long Term Care Facility, I'm still going to call you to follow-up. But we'll talk about that a little bit later as we move further in, in our therapy. Okay?

And, and you tell me that you pray every single morning immediately after waking up. And so, in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are many different things that we do.

00:42:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:42:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA If you-- I might need to look it up later on, but it read in the bible, be anxious for nothing. 

00:42:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:42:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Cuz God takes care everything. 

00:42:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But I see that you have your, your bible pretty sectioned out there - 

00:42:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:42:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - so, when get an opportunity, you can look in there. 

00:42:20

SERIASHIA CHATTERS I'll let me know where it is. 

00:42:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. I'll let you know 

00:42:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But remember we've been working on some relaxation techniques for you to do to help to calm your environment. 

00:42:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:42:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because, you, you haven't been having any type of panic attacks - 

00:42:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:42:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - but just a little bit an anxious feeling. Now, what I want you to do grandmother Tita, is after you finish your relaxation, and you had your, your cup of tea at the end of the day and you're getting ready to lay down, and you do your breathing. I want you to pull out that Bible and I want you to read over those scriptures. 

00:42:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:42:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And really think about them. 

00:42:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:42:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because, if they help to bring your anxiety from an eight to two. They are really important for you to use, that it would really help you with your transition. And a wonderful thing about the bible, is that you could take it anywhere. 

00:43:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Oh, yeah. I think-- what I can leave this? 

00:43:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I see.

00:43:10
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:43:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - to the Long Term Care Facility, and we'll always be with you. 

00:43:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Uhm. 

00:43:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS But as we've talked about often, God will always be with you as well.

Final Session 

00:44:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, grandmother Tita, we've been discussing that this is our final session. 

00:44:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:44:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And you are about to move over to the Long Term Care Facility. And I'm so excited to hear that you are moving to, ah, partial supervised apartment living. 

00:44:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:44:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So now a 24-hour care, because when I noticed that you've walked in here, I said "Okay, she still could move and kind of do her own things so that you just need that partial supervision." 

00:44:25
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:44:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, you-- we were discussing that a lot of your fear has come down, because prior you thought you are going to be in the nursing home like your friend who passed away from diabetes - 

00:44:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes. 

00:44:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS - where it was 24 hour care hospital beds. But you are going to be just moving to an apartment where you have supervision and help that you needed. 

00:44:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:44:40
Relapse Prevention Plan 

00:44:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So, what are we going to do now, is we are going to discuss a plan on in case for whatever reason after you transition you start feeling those feelings of anxiety. 

00:44:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:44:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So... 

00:44:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA Just like a back-up thing? 

00:44:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Like a back-up plan. 

00:44:55
GRANDMOTHER TITA All right. Okay, okay. 

00:44:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So then-- what in therapy, we call it a Relax Prevention Plan. 

00:45:00
GRANDMOTHER TITA Oh, okay. 

00:45:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Ah, what it is really, is a back-up plan. "If these feelings come back, what do I do now?" 

00:45:05
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. Okay. 

00:45:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS All right. So, because is, and this is our final session, and I know that the partial care facility has social a worker. But I wanna make sure that I put you on connection with what you can do in case these feelings come back 

00:45:20
GRANDMOTHER TITA Okay. Okay. 

00:45:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Now, what I wanna prepare for, is when you first move into this partial care facility, a partial supervisions facility. For first couple of days, that first week is normally going to be a little bit difficult. 

00:45:30
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:45:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Because, you are leaving your home, where you were with your husband, and where you've been with your children. So that's going to be difficult. 

00:45:35
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:45:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS So I want you to expect a little bit of sadness in that. 

00:45:40
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:45:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay? And I'm gonna be giving you a phone call during that transition just to find out how things are going. But I just wanna prepare you for that. 

00:45:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA Uhm. 

00:45:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Then finally, when you move in it is a new place. 

00:45:55

00:48:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. Now, let's discuss that a little bit. So, what if the people don't treat you well in this, in this facility. What will you do then? 

00:48:15
GRANDMOTHER TITA Well, first of all. I think I may talk to, to, to one or two of them if they-- not, not, not argue cuz, you know, I'm the old woman. I, I live in for Jesus now. I, I can't be going to do that thing. But I might talk to them and then I might even read on them the scripture. That, you know, to calm down, and say maybe, they might be having some issues with their self, you know. So, it might not be me, but I'll talk to them and then I'll pray, and I read my bible, then like a call, even uhm, the personal maybe a on, on the face, maybe talk to-- I'm the social worker - 

00:48:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS That's right. 

00:48:50
GRANDMOTHER TITA - and then you say you will give me a number. Right? 

00:48:55

GRANDMOTHER TITA Yes, so I maybe could call you and you know, feel better about it. Cuz like you said, you, you, you really can, uhm, see that, they might grow up on some good values, and all of those other things. Even though they have to educate it. So, I, I gotta realize that some people, you know, they, they have some little problems themselves. They may even need to come and see you.

Older adults will be exhibiting symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and many of the other mental disorder. Interestingly enough, many people with mental disorder may not appear the same as they do in our younger population. So its very important the therapist understand these symptoms, be able to recognize them and treat them with Cognitive Behavioral Therapeutic Technique. Additionally, we would like you to recognize that grandmother Tita was from the Bahamian-- come from the Bahamas. Excuse me. Any of our client that have many different multi-cultural order.
