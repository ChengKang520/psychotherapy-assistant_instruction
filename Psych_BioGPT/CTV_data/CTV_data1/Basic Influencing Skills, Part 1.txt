BASIC INFLUENCING SKILLS 3rd Edition Allen E. Ivey Norma Block Gluckstern Mary Bradford Ivey William L. H. Roberts and featuring Kathryn Bohn Copyright 1997 Microtraining Associates Box 9641, No. Amherst, MA 01059-9461 (413) 549-2630 Fax (413) 549-0212 Introduction to Basic Influencing Skills Allen E. Ivey 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Welcome. Counseling and psychotherapy are about stories. Clients come to us with stories about a family member experiencing cancer, what happened to them as result to an automobile accident. Clients come to us with stories about vocation indecision, wondering what to do. Our first task as helpers is to listen to their stories and understand how they came to come about with their particular version or narrative of their life. Now, after we hear the story carefully, empathically, what do we do next? Ah, these tapes suggest that what, the first thing to do is to find a strength- 

00:01:15
Build on client strengths 

00:01:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - a positive asset, a resource in that client. I think too often, we focus only things that are wrong with clients. In these tapes, we want to balance negative story telling with positive stories and that serves as the foundation for change. So in the first part of these tapes, we'll be focusing on listening to the client's story and positive strengths. As we move along in the influencing skills series, we're going to start focusing on restorying. Telling the story from different perspectives, seeing situations in new ways. And then, we're moving toward what we call the influencing skills in this process of restorying. And finally, after you've done a new story, I think it's important to work with the client for behavioral action. So, moving and doing something with the story is a vital part of this whole process and in the final tape for example, we'll see how to use assertiveness training to work on action as we change the client's story. So, to sum up. 

00:02:15
1. Story 2. Positive Asset 3. Restory 4. Action 

00:02:15
ALLEN E. IVEY This first part, the model's relatively straightforward. Hear the client's story, build on positive strengths, the positive asset search then work toward restorying, changing the nature of the narrative with the client not on the client and finally, moving toward appropriate behavioral action. Now, all of these are done in a multicultural context and we hope we can do a little bit in these tapes to consider issues of gender, ah, affection orientation, race ethnicity and other factors which I think are important in the counseling process. We're gonna do all of these via process called microtraining, using microskills. We break the interview down into discrete units, and when you practice wherein I'll ask you to focus specifically on one single dimension of helping. Now, I know that's gonna be a bit awkward at first but we find as you get into specifics and gradually, the specifics start internalizing and end up helping you listen and work with the client's stories more effectively. Ah, microtraining has over 300 database studies which say that the system works and is useful. The crucial issue is behavioral transfer. So after we presented a single skill, we need to work on practicing the behavior. Ideally, you're going to videotape yourself and see yourself in videotape or at least audiotape. Make a transcript at times and look at yourself. And after you've done this practice, think about generalization to your own interviewing work. Unless you take these skills actively into the world at large, not much is going to happen. Ah, the final tape which Norma Gluckstern and I are going to do is on teaching skills. 

00:04:00
Teach clients skills as well as learning them yourself 

00:04:00
ALLEN E. IVEY One of the things that can be done as an additional strategy in helping is to teach your client certain of these skills and we'll briefly at the conclusion on this series, show how you can integrate microskills as an adjunct, a supplementary part of your training. So we got lots to do, thanks for coming. We look forward to working with you. 

00:04:20
End Segment 1 Introduction The Basic Listening Sequence 

00:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, as our first video, we're going to demonstrate the basic listening sequence. If we're going to hear the client's story, we need to use a listening skills of open questions, close questions if necessary, encourages, paraphrases, reflection of feeling and summary. We really need to hear that story both the facts, the feelings and how the story is organized. In addition to listening to the story, we also think it's important to move toward restorying and that is finding some positive strengths and positive assets in the client. We're going to take a difficult and troublesome topic in this state and that is the issue of sexual harassment. And for years, women were not allowed to tell their stories. They were to keep their mouth shut in effect and live with it. We now know it's important to hear the stories, find the strengths the women have to offer, internal strengths, the strengths from other people and then we can, once we've heard their story and their strengths, we can start moving to some specific solutions. In this tape, we're not gonna move to solutions, we're simply gonna draw out the story and look for some of those strengths. 

00:05:35
The BLS: Sexual Harassment Allen Ivey with Kathryn Bohn 

00:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  So Kathryn, here we are, our ah, our third session. We've been talking about you and Michael, how are things going with him? 

00:05:45

00:06:20
Open question 

00:06:20
KATHRYN BOHN Well, uhm, I think it would have been okay if it just, maybe left it at that, or... (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
KATHRYN BOHN ...I mean, I felt a little bit, you know, ah, ah, just ah, you know, affronted with it, like, he's never really talked to me before and all of a sudden... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
KATHRYN BOHN ...he's complimenting me on my, you know my, nicely sculpted legs to... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
KATHRYN BOHN ...you know, to paraphrase him. But he started going on about it. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm, so you really kind of,- 

00:06:40
Reflection of Feeling 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - kind of, felt affronted, you felt kind of. 

00:06:40
KATHRYN BOHN  Small. 

00:06:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Small. So I understand, you felt kind of small and demeaned by this. That's not great. 

00:06:50
KATHRYN BOHN No. I, I don't think it is and I'm, I don't know, I, I'm not sure how to, (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:06:55
KATHRYN BOHN what to do next. 

00:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So one of the things you'd like to talk about- 

00:07:00
Summary of Kathryn's story 

00:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - is maybe, doing something about it. Ah, so, so far, so far, I've kind of got a general thing that we might wanna get just a few more details. I hear that this guy came in, ah, talked about your, about your legs. I also hear that you felt small and, ah, the whole idea of treating women as objects can make them feel small... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and then, ah, I felt affronted, I've kind of interpret that there's a beginning anger there, perhaps. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
KATHRYN BOHN Perhaps, 'coz I haven't, maybe done something. I, I mean I feel like... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
KATHRYN BOHN  I should do something. 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
KATHRYN BOHN But what? 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So you kinda feel- 

00:07:40
Paraphrase 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - a need maybe to do something and I think that's important. 

00:07:45
In the following exchange, Allen talks upfront about male/female difference in the helping relationship. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Before going further, just to make sure that ah, we're okay 'coz here you are, talking about sexual harassment with a, with a man... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I, make, make sure that you're okay. 'Coz sometimes, you know, well, you know men. 

00:08:05
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. (Laughs) 

00:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Sometimes, (laughs) ah, regardless that work pretty well on the issues between you and Michael... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I think that ah, of course, parts of the thing, I think that to help to see Michael's frame of reference but I think I've been able to hear yours as well... (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but ah, I want you to feel that same feeling you can here. And so, if I'm not totally (inaudible ) you'll come back at me, and I'll do the best I can. How do you feel about continuing this with me? 

00:08:25
KATHRYN BOHN I feel pretty good. 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:08:25
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, I do. 

00:08:25
Discussing gender or cultural difference between counselor and client is important. At issue, however, is the matter of how it is done and the timing. What are your opinions of this example? 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, I hear that- 

00:08:40
Open and closed questions 

00:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - you'd like to do something ah, but ah, so could you tell me, where does this guy stand in relation to, to you, is he, he, is he your boss? 

00:08:50
KATHRYN BOHN He's my boss. 

00:08:50

ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:09:05
KATHRYN BOHN ...what, should I ever, you know, dare wear a skirt again? I mean, is the, is the conversation gonna focus on me, again? 

00:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, and he, and he made a reference to his girlfriend saying, "Oh, I wish she had legs like that," and then I think, what a pig-headed jerk he is. 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
KATHRYN BOHN You know. I mean, you should just... (crosstalk)

00:09:25
KATHRYN BOHN  I, I don't know.

00:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - I really hear, you're saying loud and clear, that this guy is really coming across pretty strong and heavy... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm.

ALLEN E. IVEY ...on you. You get the feeling of being demeaned, you feel a little angry, ah, ah, does anyone do something that, before we get into what you're doing, ah, I kinda like to know a little bit about ah, how are you reacting now- 

00:09:50

ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
KATHRYN BOHN or checking me out. I, I think, I think, I'm creating a distance and a wall that, that shouldn't exist between... (crosstalk)

00:11:15
Paraphrase with check-out 

00:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - I hear you saying, you looked down, ah, I also kinda heard that you kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
KATHRYN BOHN Hmm. 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...almost took as if it were your fault what was going on rather than him. Uhm, uhm, I hearing you correctly? 

00:11:30
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, you know, I, I felt bad that, I mean, that he saw me... (crosstalk)

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
KATHRYN BOHN  for how I looked and, and then it was the office and, and that I wouldn't look like this way again. 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, as you look at that- 

00:11:55
Reflection of feeling 

00:11:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - you felt bad, just look at back at that. We also talked about anger. What is the emotion that might be more what, what emotion- 

00:12:00
Open question 

00:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - I hear, I think I can understand why you'd feel bad, 'coz you put, your boss is there and so forth but, what are some other emotions you might actually really feel in the situation like that? 

00:12:10
KATHRYN BOHN Anger? 

00:12:10

ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, and I sense you also got a whole feeling that maybe- 

00:12:20
Feedback 

00:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  -ah, I think those are right on target. 

00:12:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
Reframe, mild interpretation 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And also maybe feeling being trapped because he is your boss. 

00:12:25
KATHRYN BOHN Oh, completely trapped... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:12:30
KATHRYN BOHN ...I mean, you know, what's the comeback line on that one? I don't know. (Laughs) 

00:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY What's the comeback line? Okay, so what we're going to do now ah, is just shift a little bit as I kinda hear the situation. 

00:12:40
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Before we come back with the comeback line, I think we need, ah, just look at some of your own, the strengths that you have and later on, ah, in the interview, I'd like to start working at some comeback lines and maybe we're going to have to go to the ah, to some real sharp stuff on this in which we can negotiate that as well. But for the moment, ah- 

00:13:00
Positive asset search 

00:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - I can see that you kinda feel, hmm, what basically I'd like to do is focus a little bit on some of your strengths. 

00:13:05
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, just, I want to just to get to, could you tell me, ah,- 

00:13:10
Open question 

00:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - first of all, about what you think you're doing good on the job. I just wanna hear one of those. 

00:13:15
The positive asset search To help a client build a new story, we recommend finding internal and external strengths and supports. We grow from our strengths. 

00:13:15
KATHRYN BOHN  Uhm, I'm writing well. 

00:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
Note Mmm-hmm's as encourages 

00:13:30
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, I'm meeting deadlines. 

00:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
KATHRYN BOHN  And I'm, I have really, I'm, I'm showing that, I'm showing that I'm, I'm listening to the clients... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
KATHRYN BOHN ...I work with a lot of clients. I'm showing that I'm listening to them and I'm reacting to what they're listening. 

00:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
KATHRYN BOHN And I feel those are three great skills to have in my profession. 

00:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
KATHRYN BOHN And I feel. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And as you're saying that, I like the way that you're sort of- 

00:13:50
Feedback, self-disclosure on positive strengths 

00:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - standing up proudly, I do, I can listen, I can speak to clients effectively and I really kind of got my act together. I, I really hear that and it makes me feel good to hear that and I also just like the way it is. So you do have some strengths... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, I see. 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and I would just point out briefly that those strengths that you already have, you could perhaps transfer to working to your boss, to standing up, speaking directly and so forth. Now, we're gonna need to do a little bit more work... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. (laughs) 

00:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...like what you already have this thing. How does that come across? 

00:14:20
KATHRYN BOHN That, that sounds good. 

00:14:20
Check-out 

00:14:20
KATHRYN BOHN  I mean, for one, it wouldn't be faking it. 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
KATHRYN BOHN I, I feel it's something I can draw from... (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
KATHRYN BOHN  from my own experience and, and maybe put a little the, the work, the work that I do with clients on him and, and really, yeah, I'd, I'd like to try that. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY One of the things I'd like to do when I- 

00:14:40
Information-sharing 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - work on difficult issues like this, it's not just start and position the feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  weak and demean. I'm about to find positive strengths. Another thing is that sometimes, it's useful to think about, ah, women role models. 

00:14:50
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, and ah, how they might handle the situations. Who is a- 

00:14:55
Open question 

00:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, a hero for you as a woman, a role model that you'd like sometimes think about? 

00:15:00
KATHRYN BOHN I mean, I'd, I'd, I think of my mother, I really do. 

00:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY You think of your mother? 

00:15:05
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
Paraphrase 

00:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:15:05
KATHRYN BOHN I think of her inner strength, uhm, to stand up not just in the face... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
KATHRYN BOHN ...of controversy or like this, maybe... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
KATHRYN BOHN  you know, sexual harassment but just everything... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
KATHRYN BOHN ...she stood up, back straight... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
KATHRYN BOHN ...you know, just right there, uhm, divorce, you know, uhm, I mean, one of very few women uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:15:25
KATHRYN BOHN ...to get a doctorate at, ah, at her age. 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You sound very proud of her. 

00:15:30
Reflection of feeling 

00:15:30
KATHRYN BOHN Oh, I'm, I idolize her. I, I think that she really, uhm, you know, she to me is the model... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
KATHRYN BOHN ...of, of, uhm, of strength in a woman. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So you really have a strong woman model. 

00:15:45
KATHRYN BOHN I do. 

00:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And you're also, interesting enough to me, if look back. 

00:15:45
Open question 

00:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  How do some of your mother's strengths already show in some of your work in the job, in you? 

00:15:50
KATHRYN BOHN Well, I think, I just think my ability to interact with people and to be, you know, uhm, focused on them and to, you know, to listen well, uhm, you know, she listens well to people and she reacts well to people... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
KATHRYN BOHN ...uhm, and as I say, she, you know, she kills them with niceness. She just ah... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
KATHRYN BOHN ...never has this angry... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
KATHRYN BOHN ...angriness about her uhm, but I mean, she just, she just reacts positively... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
KATHRYN BOHN ...to a situation. 

00:16:20
Paraphrase 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So one thing you can redraw from your mother is a need to draw positively. 

00:16:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
Confrontation 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY But at the same time, you may have to, not all to be totally positive to it. 

00:16:30
KATHRYN BOHN Well, not totally positive, I mean, but I mean, just in, in the, in the face of... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:16:35
KATHRYN BOHN ...like a stranger or a professional... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
KATHRYN BOHN ...that, you know, or, just something like that, I mean, possibly. 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, so I hear- 

00:16:40
Summary with check-out 

00:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - I hear, also hear in this, perhaps a clue is in your mother being nice. And, and with, with the strength in background, it's(ph) also is nice sometimes, you stand up and speak forth right and indirectly, and ah, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:16:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...you can, you certainly demonstrated that and what we're going to do in the next phase is I like to do a little role playing with you about how you might stand up. At the same time, a little bit later in the session, I kinda like to talk to you about, if the, ah, do we need to go to some type of more formal type of things. There's lots of things that can be done but I want you to know that, ah, I've heard that you do have some issues on the job. 

00:17:20
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I've heard the feeling of the demeaning. I just wanna contrast that with the feeling of strength from your mother... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...the strength that you, yourself are already showing in the job. So I think, with working those together, I think we can do something. So, how does that seem for you so far? 

00:17:30
KATHRYN BOHN I think, ah, I think it's good. The process is good. It feels good to me; it feels natural. I'm not... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
KATHRYN BOHN ...drawing from something that, (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
KATHRYN BOHN that doesn't exist. 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, I think we're on track... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah(ph). 

00:17:40
KATHRYN BOHN ...I thought... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. And ah. 

00:17:40
KATHRYN BOHN ...we can move forward. 

00:17:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Another thing, I think, we perhaps- 

00:17:45
Advice/information - sharing 

00:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - wanna need to look at a little bit later on is assertiveness training and ah, along that line, ah, I think it's important that you share this with some other women, I mean, you're working with me more as a counselor/therapist. 

00:17:55
End BLS Kathryn has told her story and strengths have been defined. We are ready to "restory" and think about the situation differently. In the assertiveness example tape, Norma Gluckstern will work with Kathryn moving to behavioral action. Focusing the Narrative Helping the Client See Multiple Perspectives 

00:17:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  There are many ways to listen to a client's story but what is really important is that we listen to the story as the client is telling it to us. Focusing analysis will help you and the client, ah, focusing in a variety of perspectives of the story. However, many beginning counselors make the mistake of focusing on the initial presenting issue when what is really necessary is that we help the client experience this issue, see it from their perspective and experience it from their perspective. In the interview that follows, Billy is going to help Allen, who be, may presenting, his presenting problem, view it and experience it from a variety of perspectives. 

00:18:55
Focusing Individual Issues Relate to Family and Cultural Style William L. H. Roberts and Allen Ivey 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, Billy, I really need ah, some help. Ah, here I am in ah, Massachusetts and my dad's, ah, blind been out in above(ph) Seattle and it's ah, it's really ah, a hassle, I mean, I'd get really puzzled about how, how, how to be helpful. It's, it's really, really something. 

00:19:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Well, have you gone out to- 

00:19:25
Closed question 

00:19:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - ah, to (inaudible )? 

00:19:29
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, yeah, I've gone out to talk to them and, ah, so far but it is very, very expensive and then I get outta, I'm only out there for a couple of days and I kinda run around like crazy and I just did the best I can and I just sort of getting kinda wound up about it. 

00:19:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Yeah, well- 

00:19:50
Focus on problem: Premature advice 

00:19:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - you know, maybe ah, there's some nursing home you should put him in. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  I don't think he's quite ready for a nursing home, ah, I think he is still, yeah, he, he is blind but he does have Muriel(ph) there to help him. It's, and I think that's good. 

00:20:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Uhm,- 

00:20:10
Focus on others: Closed question 

00:20:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - Muriel(ph) is a good friend of his. 

00:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, that's, that's his ah, is the second wife, yeah. 

00:20:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Ah, ah, well, uhm- 

00:20:15
Focus on problem: Still more advice 

00:20:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - maybe the thing to do is just to, ah, call Muriel(ph) regularly and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...you know, give her some direction, or... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:20:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...maybe you can hire somebody else to help ah. 

00:20:25
Focus on problem 

00:20:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, I've been already doing that and, and so forth and ah, I, I do try to call her every week. Sometimes, a couple of times a week, ah, okay I think that's probably enough for a demo, ah. 

00:20:35
The inexperienced helper too often tries to find solutions before hearing the client's story. 

00:20:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Okay, in that example, uhm, an example of how not to, uhm, participate in helping ah, someone, we didn't take the time to really ah, understand the person or the situation they were facing. We didn't ah, ah, draw out uhm, from the person any of their concerns, we merely stepped in and start to give suggestions and advice. Ah, what we wanna try to do now is to ah, spend the time to unders, understand the situation and to invite the person to share a little more of their understanding and their experience in the, in the helping process. 

00:21:20
Focusing: Hearing the story, seeking strengths, and multiple perspectives for possible restorying. 

00:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  So Billy, ah, there it is ah, I'm here in Massachusetts and dad's out there and ah, I'm really kinda puzzled about what to do. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS You're a little, you're pretty worried about him, huh? 

00:21:40
Focus on client Reflection of feeling 

00:21:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Ah, he is my dad done an awful a lot for me and, ah, here I am, you know, 3,000 miles away, 2,500 miles away, and I really like to do more and I, I feel kinda guilty. I, I do what I can... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, the phone and so forth but ah, that leaves maybe feeling kinda, kinda sad. And I guess, I'm, you know me, I get kinda anxious about it too sometimes. 

00:22:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:22:10
Focus on Father Open question 

00:22:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Can you, can you tell me a little bit about your dad's situation? 

00:22:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, dad's ah, blind and ah, Muriel(ph), his second wife. Ah, and my mother died of cancer about ten years ago and she's been very good and very supportive. Gee, now they're 85, ah, just, he just had his 85th birthday and they're getting kinda frail and, ah, I really would like to be closer and be more supportive to him, more supportive. Ah, in one sense, the pretty vital and bright, because he's not only blind, he is, he's pretty deaf as well... (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...so. 

00:22:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS So you're, you're worried about both of them. 

00:22:50
Focus on client and parents Reflection of feeling 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh yeah, and ah, so, it's kinda hard from this long distance to, to make things happen and, and then here, ah, ah, I still got a job to do, ah, and the kids, ah, I got these, these college bills, and ah, geez, ah, it's really, it's really awful lot going on. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS There's a lot going on. 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And I find myself not sleeping so well at night right now. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:23:15
An important choice point. Billy could continue to focus on Allen's worries and feelings. He could choose to move the focus to a broader understanding. 

00:23:15
Focus on problem: Open question 

00:23:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Hmm. What, what, what kind of, uhm, plans have you made? Have you thought about any, you know, uhm, possible alternatives? Options? 

00:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  At this point, ah, I'm sitting there, kind of ah, I think kind of, I, I guess, I don't know. I really haven't done of it a lot, ah. 

00:23:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Let me, let me ask something else... 

00:23:50
Focus on client and family 

00:23:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Ah, ah, ah, ah, are there some family expectations... (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...that you will assume some of the responsibility... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...ah, for your dad and ah... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS As he gets older? 

00:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, that's one of the places where I do get ah, a little confused, you know ah... 

00:24:05
Individual styles often relate to family and cultural history 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  I come from ah, ah, basically ah, an Anglo-Celtic background. My dad actually is Celtic-Cornish and ah, I was kinda raised in one of these families which stand in your own boat, ah, I was kinda encouraged to get out on my own, get away from home, all that stuff and so forth... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and ah, and ah, the boundaries on our, our family have been pretty tight and yet this is always a very difficult issue, when do I move in? Ah, and ah, take over more... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  and ah, I wanna stand back at the same time. 

00:24:40

00:24:40
Focus on father and problem: Closed question 

00:24:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - uhm, given you any indication of... (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:24:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...you know, where he is in terms of wanting your assistance or? 

00:24:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, that actually is a good question, Billy, is that ah, as you say that, I kinda feel a lot of anxiety in my stomach and then suddenly, oh. In one sense, I'm pushing a little hard, ah, being him and who he is, ah, I think he kinda wanna hang on tough as long as he could and, ah, maybe I ought to lay back a little bit more. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. Hmm. 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:25:15
Note that this timely question worked and led Allen to a new perspective of understanding his father's story more completely. Nonetheless, use closed questions carefully as they lead the client. Note that Billy frequently uses encourages to help draw out the story 

00:25:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  To ask a couple of questions. 

00:25:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, sure. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Maybe focus on a couple of things if we could. 

00:25:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uhm, ah, could, can you tell me a little bit- 

00:25:40
Focus on family: Open question 

00:25:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - more about uhm, ah, your, your family of origin? Uhm, you know, because you're concerned about your dad and, and his wife but are there, is, is there anybody else involved that needs to be... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...concerned about this. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh my sister ah, is ah, is ah, she is ah, she is really hassled ah, right now with her job and ah, ah, my kids are really basically through college and she is really working on the college thing and ah, she backs up fairly well, pretty well. I think we all think we do more than our share of it. I think she is doing her full share, where she is right now. 

00:26:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
ALLEN E. IVEY But ah, ah, she's supportive certainly, but ah, I kinda feel that they kinda, they kinda rest on my shoulders ah, right now. 

00:26:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS So, you've talked- 

00:26:30
Focus on family: Closed question 

00:26:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - to her about this? 

00:26:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Okay, but you still feel that their responsibility is yours. 

00:26:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I do feel so. 

00:26:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS And she agrees with you? 

00:26:40
Focus on client and family: Confrontation 

00:26:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm, well. 

00:26:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Or is that something you've just ah, done on your own? 

00:26:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I hear you. Ah, 

00:26:45
Confrontation results in new perspective and insight 

00:26:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  I know if that's what you're saying, but I hear you, in other words, I maybe taking, a lot more again... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on my shoulders. A little more... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Well, (inaudible ). 

00:26:58
ALLEN E. IVEY ...responsibility than, I, I have not really talked about that, no. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:27:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I hear you saying that I'm kinda going on like the Lone Ranger, ah, doing all by myself. 

00:27:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS But something, something to think about anyway. 

00:27:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I know, I hear you. 

00:27:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Okay. Alright, what about- 

00:27:10
Focus on family: Open question 

00:27:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - what about, are there any family members that are involved? 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, of course, ah, my wife and ah... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Okay. 

00:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - and my, and my, my boys ah. 

00:27:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS If you would, can you talk a little bit about... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
Encourage 

00:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  yeah, and ah... 

00:27:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS That situation? 

00:27:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, Mary is very supportive ah, (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
ALLEN E. IVEY she listens to me a lot ah, her mother is ah, is moving on in years too and so we... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...kinda share those issues together. We're very concerned, ah, sometimes we think ah, and I think maybe Mary does ah, as I think about her, I think Mary had(ph) been the same thing you do. We're kinda moving her mother in... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...before her mother's even thinking of closing down her house... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...I think maybe both of us maybe pushing... (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...a little too hard... (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on this ah, and I, if I start getting on myself and thinking about ah, Mary, and then of course, the thing is we have that whole pole from the, from the kids and my boys are supportive and ah, in that sense I, okay, I guess I'm not as alone in this thing as I thought I was. 

00:28:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. So your boys are interested and, and involved, and wanna help. 

00:28:10
Allen has focused so much on himself and his responsibilities that he has failed to note the many positive family resources which can help build a new and more positive story. 

00:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah, I mean, like kids, they, you know, they, they kind of, a little hard to imagine grandpa getting older and all of that... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
ALLEN E. IVEY ...but ah, I'd say they're basically supportive and I'll give them a call now and then... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...got to see 'em, so I, I'm lucky. I'm really am lucky. 

00:28:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uhm. 

00:28:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I, maybe I'm making more of this. 

00:28:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS What, you know else, something,- 

00:28:45
Focus on counselor: Self-disclosure 

00:28:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - you know, something you say reminds me of myself. 

00:28:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:28:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS And that is, as the oldest in my family... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. That's me.

ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...than I probably need to. 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. 

00:28:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS I always wanna sort of make sure things are going well and... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...and fix things. 

00:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  And, ah, sometimes I have to slow down and take into account that there are other people who are also involved. 

00:29:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Especially the, the person I'm really concerned about. 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS You know. 

00:29:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. I hear you. 

00:29:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS I wanna, maybe, maybe you can tell me a little about uhm, ah- 

00:29:15
Focus on culture/family 

00:29:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Your, your, your family background... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:29:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  cultural background. 

00:29:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Particularly, your dad and how... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...he sees things. 

00:29:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, he is, ah, in that sense ah, you know that ah, you know, I've given a lot of thought to multicultural issues and counseling and part of that, I've got into my own cultural heritage. There'd been a lot of work ah, with the Cornish-Celtic group and, (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Can you tell me of- 

00:29:40
Focus on culture Open question 

00:29:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - just a little bit about the Cornish-Celtic group? 

00:29:40
ALLEN E. IVEY well, it's Celtic-Cornish very much like the Irish and it is incredibly stubborn, independent, ah, tends to hold back emotions, ah, not talk a lot, maybe a little secretive. Very proud. Defiant. Ah, it's, and yet, ah, we have a saying, ah, there's a cultural, there's a saying in Cornwall, "One and all." 

00:30:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Which is kind of intriguing, and I think it really says we are individuals and yet we are together, as well. And it's a little different than a total interconnection. It's kinda like as a big emphasis... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY ...on independence. 

00:30:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And God, ah, that certainly was true in my history. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY That, ah, I was always expected to get away beyond my own, be an individual... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and all of that. And as I've gotten into multicultural issues(ph), I said, "Hey, why all this emphasis? And I, I really miss my Dad." 

00:30:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And doing what, in effect my family upbringing says and say, "Hey I would like to be closer." 

00:30:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:30:45
Cultural issues from the family of origin often appear in the client here and now behavior 

00:30:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  So, I'd, I'd like to just go back- 

00:30:55
Focus on culture and family: Positive reframe/interpretation 

00:30:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Because at the beginning you, your description, you used the word "stubborn." And I wonder if we could translate that into "determined?" Does that fit? 

00:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS So maybe that's a better word? 

00:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And that certainly describes my dad. 

00:31:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Okay. 

00:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY He's such so gutty. 

00:31:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Okay. So, he's a very- 

00:31:10
Focus on father and culture: Reframe/interpretation 

00:31:10
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - individualistic determined, kind of person. Uhm, who likes to be self-contained. 

00:31:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. 

00:31:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS And I'm sure... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Absolutely. 

00:31:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...he doesn't want to be dependent. 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

00:31:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, he doesn't want to be dependent. You've got it. 

00:31:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS No. 

00:31:25
ALLEN E. IVEY That is that cultural frame... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and that is that family frame. 

00:31:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. So, part of your struggle is... 

00:31:30
Focus on client, family and culture: Interpretation/reframe 

00:31:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS How to help without, uhm, crossing that boundary. 

00:31:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:31:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

00:31:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (inaudible ) Yeah. 

00:31:38
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:31:38
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah, it, it's true. 

00:31:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, he seemed to like my support but if I started doing too much, it's... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:31:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:31:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Well, can you, maybe we can sort of think, now, having sort of looked at some of those elements, ah, where you are...- 

00:31:55
Focus on client: Open question 

00:31:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS With this. I don't... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...I don't know if any of this has sort of helped you to sort out any of your, your thoughts... (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...on these. 

00:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, yeah, in, in a broad sense, I begin to see that, ah, in fact, all this talking to you, I mean, this is not just, you know, for the tape or anything like that, I can sort of feel, I don't basically(ph) on tape... 

00:32:15
Alleviation of concerns often shows in the body 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I feel my shoulders not as much like this. 

00:32:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I kinda feel that, ah, ah, you know, a little more centered about it. Ah, 'coz the issue really is, is one that I kinda struggle with. 

00:32:25
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And it is a pattern for me to overkill. 

00:32:30
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, worry a problem to death. And. 

00:32:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS So, uhm, but, but the, the worry- 

00:32:40
Return to problem focus and and the client: Open question 

00:32:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS - is not always there, is it? 

00:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY No. 

00:32:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS It's just how you act on it. 

00:32:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Okay. So, you know, what are you thinking about now... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...as, as, as possible course of action, and what, what do you feel like you ought to do... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...or want to do or need to do now? 

00:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I think that, you know, just, ah, in dealing with you here and, and, and to focusing on it from some, some other perspective, I sit there and say, "I'm inclined, number one, to, and it's, it's almost like I need to, just relax in my gut... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY ...and, ah, not push so hard. Ah, I think I need to stay on the phone. Stay alert. Make sure that the, the help is there and I think we need to get somebody in, ah, constantly. And I don't think I've seen to that, to see 'coz Dad's gonna say everything is fine... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY ...when it might not be fine. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  If I'm over here, I think we're going to have to follow up with that. So I think there is some action I've got to take and, ah, but I've been sort of going on as if should do it. 

00:33:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And I think I need to talk to my sister. Older brother needs to talk to younger sister. Identify what she's saying and say, "Well... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...maybe we'll have a little more open chat about this." 

00:34:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I guess some beginning ideas. 

00:34:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you, Billy. 

00:34:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS You're welcome. 

00:34:00
Billy reviews the session 

00:34:00
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Well, this was to me an interesting, ah, interaction with Allen and his concern about his dad and, and taking care of him. Uhm, I think, what we tried to do was to focus on different elements of concern that he had, to try to identify them. Put some, make them concrete so that he could then sort of, ah, interpret them and, and incorporate them into his, uhm, decision-making process. Ah, one of the things that we didn't have a chance to discuss was some of his, perhaps, angry feelings about being saddled with this responsibility. Ah, in my conversation with him after this, ah, interaction that you saw, he indicated that, ah, when his mom died about ten years ago, there were a lot of feelings that he had with his dad that he had a chance to work through. Uhm, so that isn't such a major concern, but anger, ah, does sort of surface or residuals of the anger does sort of surface periodically and one has to be, sort of mindful of that. Ah, the, the very, uhm, I think useful thing about this interaction for you might be that you have a chance to identify the individual and their concerns, the familial concerns so that's in the context. But, then also, the, the cultural entities, uhm, those elements of one's his, history and one's cultural experience that enters into every interaction, ah, and it must be understood and appreciated and valued in order to be really helpful to, to a person. So, ah, I look forward to, ah, helping you again. 

00:35:40
End Focusing Confrontation: Supporting While Challenging 

00:35:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Our next skill is that of confrontation. No, we aren't interested in having you, ah, attack your client. We aren't interested in you tearing them apart. Confrontation is a word that somehow the counseling field has chosen to help a client identify when they aren't being fully consistent with themselves. Ah, in some ways, I prefer to think about the word "challenging" and think of it as, by the way, a supportive challenge. So what ah, I would like to begin this tape with is identifying some discrepancies that clients might show, and then as you identify discrepancies, I'd like you to think about a model confrontation se, sentence, which basically is supportive. And it kind of begins with, "I hear you saying..." supportive," On one hand," such and such. "But on the other hand, I hear you saying" such, such. How do you put those two together? And, believe it or not, sometimes, this actually hand-balance to point out the difference can actually be useful sometimes, to physicalize the session. So, we're gonna do some quick, short demos of inconsistencies and, or, or, discrepancies. Identify the discrepancies and try some of the model sentences: "On one hand, this. And on the other hand, that." 

00:37:05
Identifying Discrepancies and Incongruity Observe these clients. Identify discrepancies and reflect them back via a supportive confrontation. Vignette 1: Incongruity between people (Stop tape after each vignette) 

00:37:05
BILLY  You know, I'm really sort of ah, an adventuresome kind of person. Ah, I like to travel to different countries and explore different cultures and really understand firsthand, experientially, what they're like. And, ah, I'd like to do that as much and as often as I can. But, I have a challenge, and that is my wife who I'd love to share it with me, is really a homebody. She prefers to stay close to home and to do things there. So, I'm constantly in this bind of wanting to go and wanting to also be with her. Wanting her to come and wanting to be where she is. So, it's, you know, it's awkward. 

00:38:05
On one hand, Billy you feel...., but on the other hand, your wife feels... (As appropriate, add suggestive feedback) Vignette 2: Incongruity between words and action 

00:38:05
MARY IVEY  I don't know what the problem is. The report's only a week late. 

00:38:20
"Mary, on one hand... but on the other hand..." Vignette 3: Discrepancy between words and feelings 

00:38:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'm really feeling torn, ah, one part of me really wants, ah, to do what you suggest, I, I really do. But, I keep thinking about, you know, what might happen if I actually did it and it makes me feel a little frightened. I like the idea but wow! 

00:38:55
Offer Allen a supportive confrontation Vignette 4: Incongruity in family 

00:38:55
KATHRYN BOHN  My sister and I are planning this big party for my parents. And as soon as we get involved in the plan, she just takes a backseat to the whole thing and, and just wants me to do it all. I don't have time but I, I have to. This is their party. We want to make it perfect. 

00:39:20
Given dimensions of denial, how are you going to be supportive and confront Kathryn? Vignette 5: Incongruity between actions and words 

00:39:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You know, I really resent the way you presented my comments and said I was defensive. I don't think I'm a defensive person. I think I've been pretty open to you and I really reject anything that you told me. 

00:39:50
How would you confront Norma? Given dimensions of denial, how are you going to be supportive? Confrontation: Problematic patterns in one relationship often appear in the next relationship as well. Mary Ivey with Norma Gluckstern 

00:39:50
MARY IVEY  Hello Norma! How you doing? 

00:40:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Good. 

00:40:00
MARY IVEY Good. Nice to see you. Well, I guess we'll continue talking about the things we were talking about before, the marriage situation now and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, well. 

00:40:10
MARY IVEY ...what it's like before and what it's like now? 

00:40:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN This, the second marriage, as you know, and ah... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:40:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...I'm very, very happy marriage with Bill. 

00:40:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN But I see the same thing happened to Bill what happened when I was married to John. 

00:40:20
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, it seems to me, that I'm always wrong. 

00:40:25
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN They're never wrong. And no matter what I do, no matter what I say, and I try to be cooperative, ah, we always into these petty arguments and I just, I just feel that it's, it's not my fault. 

00:40:35
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That I do everything to help the situation, and instead, I get back, "Well, you are, you're being unreasonable, Norma". 

00:40:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, and it just, it just, I don't see myself as being unreasonable. 

00:40:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I really think I'm very reasonable. 

00:40:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So it sounds like, uhm...- 

00:40:55
Paraphrase 

00:40:55
MARY IVEY The situation from the last marriage is, is, ah, same kind of pattern occurring in this marriage, and, and, ah, they're saying you're not very reasonable and you think you're very reasonable. 

00:41:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, you know, I, I think I'm always getting into arguments. 

00:41:05
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:41:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I'm always giving in. It's always giving in, and in times I feel maybe I'm right. And that I never hear them say, "You're right." It's always they're right. 

00:41:15
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:41:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And it just seems we're getting into the same pattern that I got into with John, and being with Bill. And it is creating some problems in the marriage. I have to admit it's creating problems in the marriage. 

00:41:25
MARY IVEY Okay. So the kind of problems that you had in the first marriage...- 

00:41:25
Accurate paraphrasing is supportive 

00:41:25
MARY IVEY Are very similar to what you're experiencing right now. And, and, uhm, the issues are, are kind of similar. It has to do with arguing. 

00:41:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
MARY IVEY On the one hand, I hear you not, uhm, feeling- 

00:41:40
Confrontation 

00:41:40
MARY IVEY - very responsible for any of this but you know, I've heard you before and on the other hand I can hear in your voice some anger about what's happening to you, in this relationship. 

00:41:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. Absolutely, and, ah, I don't know, ah, well, I don't really know what to do about it, uhm, because, and it starts over just trivial things. 

00:41:55
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:41:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, ah, we can be, be reading the newspaper and, and pointing(ph) at what's going in the world and, ah, ah, Bill will say, "Well, I think this is happening." And I'll say, "Well, I don't think you're right." 

00:42:05
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:42:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And then he gets indignant because I tell him I don't think he's right. I don't understand why he should get indignant about that. 

00:42:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. So you're, but on the one hand you say... 

00:42:15
Confrontation 

00:42:15
MARY IVEY "Well, I don't think you're right." You know, you're telling him sort of angrily, "I don't think you're right." And then he gets upset about it. So, you know, you say, you know, "I don't think you're right." And on the other hand, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yes. 

00:42:25
MARY IVEY ...maybe there's some other ways that you could, ah, express how you're feeling with him and things could work out a little better. 

00:42:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, you pointed out something that, ah, that I had thought about, because it is sort of like a confrontation. We all, we, we seem to get into this sort of this competitive thing. Who's gonna win the argument? 

00:42:40
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:42:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I don't think of myself being competitive, but he keeps telling me, "But you are competitive and you're always trying to see if you can one up me," and that really hits me. 

00:42:45
MARY IVEY So the one hand there's, he, he's, he's saying you're competitive but you're not, you're saying you're not competitive. And I remember from the other marriage that, ah, competition was a big issue. That, ah, the competition between the two of you and, and, ah, sounds like that pattern is occurring again. And he's pointed it out and you're not seeing that there is some competition between the two of you. 

00:43:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, you know Mary, I never thought of myself being competitive. And so, to be honest with you, even, even though I, I think I'm just competitive with myself. I didn't... (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...think I was competitive, say, with you or somebody else... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and so, really, it's not the vision I have of myself as being competitive. 

00:43:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
Confrontation 

00:43:20
MARY IVEY So you don't see yourself as being competitive. 

00:43:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN No. 

00:43:25
MARY IVEY But they, they say you're competitive. So your, your vision of yourself is not competitive. 

00:43:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That would be because... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
MARY IVEY Well, there's everybody else. The men in your life see you as being in competition with them. Okay, Norma, we've been talking a little bit. I think I understand the situation. But, let's, let's see if we can- 

00:43:35
Concreteness 

00:43:35
MARY IVEY - talk about a specific example and see if we can understand this just a little bit better. 

00:43:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right, you know, if we're reading the newspaper or watching the news or something, and, and there'd be some interesting happening in the world. 

00:43:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And he'll say, "But you know, I think that, ah, this is my opinion on what's going on in that... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...in(ph) that situation." And then I sometimes don't think he's analyzing it right. 

00:43:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And I'll say, "No, I don't think it's right," 

00:44:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Then or I'll say, "I don't think it's right. And this is way I figure, that I look at it. 

00:44:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, ah, this thing starts escalating and all of a sudden we're in a competition, who's right about the article or who's right about what the reporter's saying, and, uhm, I think he's unreasonable. I think that I am very reasonable. 

00:44:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And he tells me my tone of voice is a, is unreasonable. And, it just, and it begins to escalate. 

00:44:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And then all of a sudden, what I think happens is, we become in competition. 

00:44:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Who's gonna win? 

00:44:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN One up... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  one down. 

00:44:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And it's when, it then, ah, is your, I'm talking but I mean he's so angry, I feel like. 

00:44:40
MARY IVEY So it sounds, it sounds like you're saying in the one hand... 

00:44:40
Confrontation 

00:44:40
MARY IVEY That, you know, he thinks you're unreasonable and, and you don't. You think you're very reasonable. 

00:44:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's right. 

00:44:45
MARY IVEY On the other hand, ah, at the other hand, as you talk, Norma, I hear that anger coming out as you're talking about the situation. So, ah, perhaps... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh. 

00:44:55
MARY IVEY ...you are a little bit angry. 

00:44:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:44:55
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:44:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Let me just, just calm down a little bit. 

00:44:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Ah, because this is a, what happens then is I start getting depressed. And... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...I start feeling, well, I guess I start feeling he doesn't care about me. 'Coz if he care about me, he would, you know, he love me, he would certainly, ah, pick up on what I was feeling and maybe he'd think I was right. And so I get depressed and then he withdraws and I withdraw. And then, we go sulking around the house for a week. And I really think it's his fault. He never really reaches out, comes to me. 

00:45:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I, I reach out, come to him, and I just think he rejects it. 

00:45:30
Confrontation 

00:45:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. So you feel like you reach out to him and then he isn't doing anything and he's not helping in doing his part and, and you don't, ah, seem to take any responsibility for your interaction in this, that you sound like you're always right. You know, similar to the, what happened in the previous marriage... 

00:45:45
Feedback 

00:45:45
MARY IVEY Where the competition's there and, and you sort of blame it on the other person, and it's always, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hmm. 

00:45:50
MARY IVEY ...your fault and not necessarily you, you're taking some responsibility that, that you might have something to do with what's happening in this relationship. 

00:46:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, you pointed out something, sort of interesting, Mary, that there is a similarity in what's going on between Bill and myself now... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and in what went on between John and myself. We would get into these things and, and we'd all, I get all, the dialogue's is almost the same but ah, I guess I'd not really thought that I was contributing to it. 

00:46:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And you're sort of pointing out to me that maybe I am. 

00:46:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. Right now I feel you're looking at the situation just a little differently. Uhm, was your bringing, looking at the past marriage and looking at marriage now, how does that sound to you, Norma? 

00:46:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I think, you're, you're right... (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...that I, I, I really hear what you're saying. I really understand it but it's going to be hard for me to change. (laughs) It's going to be hard because, ah, oh I already sound that I'm ready to fight again, I'm already, I'm already, in fact I'm already trying to justify you when you tell me you're wrong. 

00:46:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So ah, this seems to be ah, a pattern that I've established. 

00:46:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. As you're talking with a smile on your face... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
Confrontation 

00:46:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:46:55
MARY IVEY  and I can still feel that underlying... (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I'm trying to compete with you... 

00:47:00
MARY IVEY And you're annoyed at me and that underlying anger... (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:47:00
MARY IVEY ...the same sort of anger that you... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:47:05
MARY IVEY ...have towards your, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:47:05
MARY IVEY ...ex-husband and you have these husband, so. 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, this really is very helpful, Mary Ann... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:47:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and now I have to ah, integrate it. 

00:47:10
MARY IVEY Integrate it. (laughs) 

00:47:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And that may not be so easy but... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and, and maybe we could, if you don't mind, if I could come and talk to you a little more about this 'coz I feel you. 

00:47:20
MARY IVEY Oh, absolutely. Just to think about these things and see what we can, what we can do and, and see if we can do something about changing some of those patterns. 

00:47:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, and then I can argue with you. 

00:47:30
MARY IVEY Okay, right. (laughs) 

00:47:30
END Confrontation Vignette Identifying the Five Levels of the Confrontation Impact Scale Norma Gluckstern with Kathryn Bohn The next segments illustrate the Confrontation Impact Scale. Note how Kathryn moves from denial to awareness. If you observe your clients, you note how they respond to confrontation and other interventions, thus indicating their willingness and ability to change and move. 

00:47:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, Ka, Kathryn, (laughs) Kathryn, ah, last week when you were here we were talking about your job and Michael, do you want to continue, ah, talking about that issue? (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
KATHRYN BOHN Oh, yeah. 

00:48:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, at least- 

00:48:10
Confrontation 

00:48:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - it, I thought what I heard last week is that you're torn between your relationship with Michael and your commitment to your work. 

00:48:15
KATHRYN BOHN  Torn? I'm not torn- 

00:48:20
Level 1: Denial 

00:48:20
KATHRYN BOHN - Michael's the problem. Michael. Michael has the total problem in this relationship, not me. 

00:48:25
Feedback, reflection of feeling 

00:48:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathryn, you overreacted when I used the word torn. 

00:48:25
KATHRYN BOHN  Well, I,- 

00:48:30
Level 2: Partial acknowledgement 

00:48:30
KATHRYN BOHN - I think he's, I think he's there but he's just got, he's got to give a little bit more but, but maybe, maybe he can, maybe, maybe he can be there, I don't know. 

00:48:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN As we were talking just now, it seems to me ah, that you were taking, understanding how Michael is feeling but how do you fit into the picture? 

00:48:50
Level 3: Full acknowledgement, no change 

00:48:50
KATHRYN BOHN Well, I know Michael is trying and I, and I admire him for that and I respect him for that. Uhm, I realized that yeah, that, that work is a big deal to me and that maybe I need to be a little bit more well-rounded, balanced in my life and that work can have a role, a very important role, mind you, but that I also need to see Michael's point of view and where he fits into the picture and in our relationship. 

00:49:15
Moving acknowledgement of discrepancies to level 3, awareness is a vital beginning, but it is not action. In the next two examples, we see levels 4 and 5-moving toward change. 

00:49:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  The last time we were here, you seem to be understanding both your perspective and Michael's perspective, but I wonder where you're gonna go from here at this point? 

00:49:35
KATHRYN BOHN I think I, I think Michael and I- 

00:49:35
Level 4: Moving toward change 

00:49:35
KATHRYN BOHN - need to sit down and talk, uhm, I think we need to, you know, just have a, a very good com, open uhm, non-confrontational, ah, conversation about my life, my job and, and his life and then our life together as a whole because it is, I think we need to reach that stage. I'm not sure how we were gonna get there but I know it's gonna take some time but I think that's a next step for us. Maybe we can talk about that, uhm, next time. 

00:50:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Next time we can talk about that and then maybe I'll talk to you and give you some ideas about how you do negotiating skills 'coz that's what... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
KATHRYN BOHN That, (laughs) 

00:50:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...you are trying to do, to negotiate the differences. 

00:50:15
KATHRYN BOHN that would be really helpful. Thanks. 

00:50:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. (laughs) Good talking to you. 

00:50:15
KATHRYN BOHN  Good. Yeah, thank you. 

00:50:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathryn, this is our third session and I recall last time we talked about your developing some negotiation with Michael and I'd like to know how it's going with you, come to some resolution. 

00:50:30
KATHRYN BOHN Well, I think we have, uhm, I've- 

00:50:30
Level 5: Transcendence 

00:50:30
KATHRYN BOHN  some decisions I've made that I had to make them on my own, changes about myself having, you know, keeping work to work a week, and, uhm, not working more than one late night a week, uhm, and not working on weekends really trying to make those weekends to, for each other, and he's, uhm, he has realized the importance of my work and, and no longer criticized it and said that, you know, "Well, I don't know why you're working that much. You're not, you're not getting paid enough," or something like that, and instead he's just succumbed to the fact, but not succumb, I, I mean he's, he's compromising. He has seen that, that it makes me really happy. I feel really good about it and it's a passion of mine and I think that, uhm, that's, that's really good for him and I've seen that, that he can be, he can be in that role and, and be supportive, and yet I can change a little bit too and when I think together we can sort of work out the differences that we have and, uhm, sort of move together a little bit more smoothly. 

00:51:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I like what I'm hearing and sounds like you don't need any help now but if you ever... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
KATHRYN BOHN Well. 

00:51:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...you can come back. 

00:51:35
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. I, I think, I think we need to continue to, to work on the, you know, the communication factor, uhm, as long as we continue to talk, uhm, I'm sure that, you know, Michael and I, you know, whatever mountain we face that we can climb it, you know, kind of together to give a really bad cliché but that's good, I mean I think... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:51:55
KATHRYN BOHN ...that's important. It's good. Thanks, I really appreciate it. 

00:51:55
END Confrontation Tape Directives: Case Example with Procrastination William L. H. Roberts and Mary Ivey 

00:51:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Hi. Uhm, the next skill we're gonna talk about is the skill directives. Uh, in the helping process, it's useful ah, to be able to provide the, the client with some specific directions, ah, in order to ah, help facilitate their movement. Uhm, ah, today, ah, we're gonna talk with Mary who has a particular challenge in dealing with procrastination. Ah, she's gonna, uhm, share, ah, what her experiences and I'm gonna ask questions and try to draw out what it's like for her uhm, but I'm also gonna try to identify some of the strengths that she has, ah, typically directives issues nearly end of the helping interview, and so you will arrive at that point. 

00:52:45
Note that Billy uses the word "challenge" rather than "problem." Many feel that challenge, concern or issue are more useful words than problem 

00:52:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Hi, Mary. How are you doing? 

00:52:55
MARY IVEY Hi, Billy. 

00:52:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uhm. 

00:52:55
MARY IVEY Just fine. 

00:52:55
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Well you came, ah, to discuss a couple of things with me today? 

00:53:00
MARY IVEY Yes, uhm, I was gonna talk to you a little bit about how anxious I get when I really have to speak in front of a group and, you know, just how very nervous, nerve-wracking it is and how, just anxiety-producing and stressful it is. 

00:53:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. Can you give me- 

00:53:15
Open question Concreteness 

00:53:15
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Ah, a little example of... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
MARY IVEY Well... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS ...what happens for you? 

00:53:20
MARY IVEY Well I have to speak in front of my, uhm, school, and, uhm, I just get very nervous, I mean, uhm, my hands get all wet and sweaty and my stomach turns and I, I worry about it for days ahead of time, sometimes I don't sleep that well... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:53:35
MARY IVEY ...and then finally getting around to doing something about it and preparing a little bit beforehand, but I, I never feel really comfortable doing it. It's always very difficult and very stressful. 

00:53:40
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS  Hmm. Is there, uhm, Mary, is there any, ah... 

00:53:45
Search for positive assets 

00:53:45
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Ah, occasion when you have to make a presentation when you don't feel anxious and worried? 

00:53:50
MARY IVEY  Well sometimes, if I really get organized and have overheads ready and I'm gonna do a talk or something and, and I think through what I'm gonna say and I get those overheads ready and I practice a bit, then I feel a little bit better, but that's sort of rare. 

00:54:05
WILLIAM L. H. ROBERTS Uh-huh, so it's preparation that really helps? 

00:54:05
MARY IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. Okay. What is it that keeps you from being prepared? 

00:54:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I don't know. I, you know, I uhm, I, I guess I just sort of put it off. I keep saying, "Well that's away, that's always. I can, I can, you know, I'll do it tomorrow." 

00:54:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:54:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  And I kind of put it off and it just kind of put it in the back of my mind, you know, I'll get at it. 

00:54:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:54:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  A little bit later. 

00:54:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:54:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And then I sort of have been anxious about it and I think, "Ugh, I don't want to deal with it exactly, you know. I don't think it's gonna be very good or, or worry about what its gonna sound like, and so... (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...I just don't do anything about it. I just keep worrying about it. 

00:54:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. And you just keep putting it off... (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

00:54:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and putting it off. 

00:54:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:54:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS I see, I see. Well Mary I'm- 

00:54:45
Involve client as participant 

00:54:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS - I wonder if, uhm, there might be a couple of things you'd like to try... (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh good. 

00:54:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...that just might help you. Would, would you be willing? 

00:54:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, I would love to. Yeah. 

00:54:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

00:54:55
Having hear the story, Billy now demonstrates alternative directives Directive Example 1: Advice Drawn Positive Resource Support Network 

00:54:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Let me ask you, is there ah, someone in your life, in your family or your circle of friends who... (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, you really admire, especially around this issue of putting things off? 

00:55:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Well ah, Billy, I think about my grandmother. Her name is Amanda Jenson, and ah, she lived in a farm, the family farm, and ah, she's was a farmer's wife and did all those things that a farmer's wife did and ah, she was so, you know, on time and you know, she had to do things on time because it's the farm and things have to get done. 

00:55:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. Well. 

00:55:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Like, you know, the chores have to get done and things... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Like... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...like that. 

00:55:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Give me, give me some examples. 

00:55:45
Concreteness 

00:55:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I think of her, uhm, you know, on farm and I think of the, the alarm going off. Actually sometimes the alarm didn't go off. You could here the cows mooing, and that meant, you know, it was time to get up, and sunrise, you get up, get up with the, get up with the cows. They literally... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:56:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and she's out in the barn milking cows and I see her in the separator house there with all those big buckets of milk and, you know, pouring them in and separate the milk and the cream and then carrying them down ah, to a cooling house, which then go to the... (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...ah, dairy. 

00:56:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS So she did all of those things everyday? 

00:56:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Everyday, every single day... (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...seven days a week. 

00:56:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then she'd go home and cook for the threshers(ph) or cook for the farmers and, and tend the garden, and she did everyday. 

00:56:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Without complaining, she just, that was her life. 

00:56:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. What if, what, what do you think helped her just to keep doing that? 

00:56:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I think that she wanted to, you know, she knew she had to feed the family and she had to, this was part of her life. 

00:56:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And she does just did it. She took responsibility. She's a very responsible person. 

00:56:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

00:56:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And uhm, and she just did it 'coz she knew she had to do it. 

00:56:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No one else is gonna do it. 

00:56:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. In, in your life uhm, are you responsible in a way that she is, she was? 

00:56:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I mean, you know, in terms of this problem I, I think, you know, I, I put off a little bit. I, I procrastinate... (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

00:57:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and I, I wish I could be more, you know, attacking things and doing things, you know, on time and more on top of things. 

00:57:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Like she was. 

00:57:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. I wonder if maybe... 

00:57:10
Directives as advising the client 

00:57:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS If you viewed your own responsibilities in the same way that you view her chores, as just things that have to be done every day, if that would make a difference. 

00:57:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, it was funny when I thought about that, you know, because maybe if I just thought about it, as just chores, you have do it. 

00:57:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:57:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY This is something you have to do rather than put it off and wait and just plain do it. 

00:57:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

00:57:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Something has to be done and not worry about it, get anxious, just simply get it done with and do it. 

00:57:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  And that go through all of this other emotional trauma about it. 

00:57:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Right. I think maybe ah, some of the other feelings come, are connected to the fact that other people, you're worried that other people may judge you, and...(crosstalk) 

00:57:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. That's, I think it was, you know, probably so, yeah. 

00:57:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, ah, and if so if it's just, if there are series of chores and things that have to get done, the things that you just do it. 

00:57:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You just do it. 

00:57:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Uh-huh. 

00:58:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And that will be fine. 

00:58:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah. 

00:58:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:58:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well maybe, maybe let's try. 

00:58:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Okay? Uhm, ah, or for the next presentation you have to make. 

00:58:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

00:58:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Let's do a little test. 

00:58:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And just try to just simply do it, do it immediately and, as something, one of the thing that you have to do. 

00:58:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And not worry so much about who's gonna be, you are gonna be presenting to, whether they're going to like it or not and whether it's a reflection of you personally or professionally. 

00:58:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Just do it. I mean, do you think that's possible? 

00:58:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, maybe I could just think... 

00:58:30
Drawing on positive models often helpful 

00:58:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Of my grandma, just the way she just goes out there doing it every single day... (crosstalk) 

00:58:30

00:59:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...by the water. 

00:59:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Can you describe a little more, maybe a, a moment, or a day, or an afternoon, a couple of hours when it's just wonderful? 

01:00:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I like to be down by the beach there and just looking out with a sort of quite part of the day and maybe the, the motor boats are gone and just to look at pretty sailboats and see the uhm, mountains in the background and the. 

01:00:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Mary, close your eyes for a second.

01:00:35
Visual imagery

WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS All of a sudden your rhythm has changed, didn't it? 

01:01:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm.

WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Okay. Mary, let me ask you, you can open your eyes now. 

01:01:10

01:01:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Let me ask you to try this. 

01:01:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:01:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS When you feel worried or... (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...concerned about a presentation. 

01:01:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Maybe the first thing you can do as soon as you detect it. 

01:01:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:01:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS I'd like you to try breathing very deeply. 

01:01:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Sitting down on a, in a quiet corner. 

01:01:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Just (beeping sound) relaxing... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and then taking some deep breaths. 

01:01:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And visualizing yourself on that special lake, at that special time of year when it's really just heavenly. 

01:01:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. Summertime. 

01:01:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah, and see if that can help. 

01:01:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:01:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  You know uhm, move of you out of that anxiety. 

01:01:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. So when I have this, tend to start worrying then I just start thinking about the lake and the... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Exactly. 

01:01:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...calmness of the lake and the mountains and... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Exactly. 

01:02:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and that is (inaudible ). 

01:02:02
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And when you feel relaxed and, and, a little more at ease. 

01:02:02
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Then go ahead and actually begin your, your work. 

01:02:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Begin after I'm more relaxed. 

01:02:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Right. Okay? 

01:02:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good. Thanks Billy. 

01:02:10

WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You're welcome. 

01:02:10
Directive Example 3: Looking at personal history and using paradox help clients notice what occurs specifically for them as it is related to the past 

01:02:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  I thought uhm, maybe if we explore the couple of other avenues to assist you with this... (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:02:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...worry and anxiety... (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:02:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS That you have. It might be useful. 

01:02:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:02:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm. You know, I wonder if there was a time in your uhm, life when someone made some expectations of you, and it sort of created worry and anxiety and tension, can you remember back to a time when... (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well. 

01:02:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...something like that happened? 

01:02:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, I remember taking a piano lessons at age eight, and uhm, my mother, you know, minored in music and she was quite a good piano player and she wanted her daughters to play the piano, and not only did we have to play the piano, but we have to enter contests, piano... (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:03:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...contests. We have to learn a piece, memorize the piece, and enter a contest, and I would be so nervous and upset and worried, I was just, sometimes I'll be hysterical before I have to go ah, to perform... (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:03:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...in front of a judge... (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:03:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...playing the piano it was really scary for me. 

01:03:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah, when do you think that worry or anxiety began, I mean the time before the concert or the, the performance. 

01:03:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh I was worried from the minute I knew, I was kind of starting to get nervous in the middle and I was practicing the piece that I would have to perform. 

01:03:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:03:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And then the closer it got, the more and more I got anxious. 

01:03:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:03:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, that I would, that you have to, you're in front of an audience and the judge said in giving a grades, and then I believe that I would forget... (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:03:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...my piece. 

01:03:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS So you were really, the worry was connected to being uhm, were, you're concern about pleasing others? 

01:03:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, performance anxiety. I think I was worried that I was gonna perform and what mother would think... (crosstalk) 

01:04:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS So it was really... (crosstalk) 

01:04:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and the family. 

01:04:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...you wanted to make sure your mom was happy. 

01:04:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:04:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

01:04:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS I wonder if there's a connection between- 

01:04:05
Supportive confrontation 

01:04:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS - that experience and the experience you have with planning ah, preparing for presentations. 

01:04:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It could be, as I said that word, performance anxiety, I think in some ways, you know ah, if you're speaking in front of your school or if you're speaking in front of a class or somebody, something like that, you're performing in a way... (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well, it is performing. Yeah. 

01:04:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and you're standing up and speaking- 

01:04:25
The past impacts the present 

01:04:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - and it sort of the same thing like... (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS (inaudible ). 

01:04:29
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...playing a piano when you were eight years old. 

01:04:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS That's right. 

01:04:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And this, maybe there's not exactly a judge in the audience giving your grade, but in a sense, you know people are sort of making some evaluations of... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:04:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...how you're doing. 

01:04:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:04:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  So it's a little bit like that. 

01:04:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Sure, sure, so this business of uhm, of being uhm, a performer and being judged... (crosstalk) 

01:04:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...is was sort of conjures up those, those worries. 

01:04:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, and all those anxieties and the... (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm. 

01:04:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...tension and the nervousness and the sweaty palms... (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You know. 

01:04:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...all that. 

01:04:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

01:04:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:04:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Mary, let's try another thing. I wonder if uhm, usually what's the time that usually, the time frame before the presentation that you finally do it, you finally just say, "Okay, enough of this worry and anxiety," and, you know, when do you actually say, "Okay, now I'm going to actually do it?" 

01:05:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  It's usually a couple of days before, maybe two to three days before I finally, maybe 2 days before, actually, 'coz I'd finally will say, "Oh my God, I'm gonna do it. This is it. I better, I gotta, gotta do something. I am... (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

01:05:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...gonna have to do this." 

01:05:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So then I... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

01:05:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...set things out. 

01:05:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. That's all right. I wonder if you would be willing to try something really risky. 

01:05:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, okay. 

01:05:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Would you? 

01:05:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY We'll see, we'll see. 

01:05:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Depends on what it is. 

01:05:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Whatever it is. How risky is it. 

01:05:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS All right, all right. The next time you were asked to go, you have... 

01:05:40
Paradoxical directive 

01:05:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS To make a presentation... (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm(ph). 

01:05:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, I would like you to postpone preparing for it until the day before it's due. 

01:05:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Not two days before, not three days. 

01:05:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS But the day before, the night before it's due, in fact. 

01:06:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Wow, uh hmm. 

01:06:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS All right? Do you think you can do that? 

01:06:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I'll definitely get anxious about this one. 

01:06:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

01:06:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But hang on, I'll try. 

01:06:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS All right. And what I'd like you to do- 

01:06:05
Encourages Mary to observe her behavior more closely 

01:06:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  Also is to monitor yourself... (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...through that week. 

01:06:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yup. 

01:06:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You know to identify just how you feel and maybe get a little pad and just jot down, doesn't have to be anything fancy. They're just notes to yourself of how you're feeling about things... (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What's... 

01:06:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...what are your worries are, what your concerns are. 

01:06:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, so I'll do a little diary about how... (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Just a little brief... (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...what's happening to me which those. 

01:06:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah. Just bullet(ph) diary. 

01:06:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:06:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You know. 

01:06:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY How you're feeling... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Exactly. 

01:06:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and how I'm feeling and what's going on? 

01:06:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Exactly. 

01:06:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  My feelings, okay. 

01:06:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And that the reason I want you to do that is so that you get a full appreciation of the full intensity of the worry, because sometimes the worry is bigger in our minds than it really is. 

01:06:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:06:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You know, you make it much larger. 

01:06:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

01:06:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS So it's good to be able to sit again and touch with it and understand how, uhm, ah, dangerous if you will, or how ah, overpowering it really, really is... (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:07:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and we may discover that it is not as looming as we think it is. 

01:07:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:07:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS So, would you try that? 

01:07:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, yes, I will Billy. Thanks. 

01:07:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay, all right. Then let's get together and, and talk some more. 

01:07:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Great. Thanks so much for your help. 

01:07:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Okay. 

01:07:10
End DIRECTIVES Feedback/Self-Disclosure Mary Ivey and William L.H. Roberts 

01:07:10
MARY IVEY  I would like to share something from a basic influencing book: To see ourselves as others see us, to hear ourselves as others hear us, to be touched as we touch others, these are the goals of effective feedback. I will demonstrate two skills in this tape. They both involve sharing yourself with a client. Feedback helps the client discover how others see them and self-disclosure is sharing your own experience carefully. In using both these skills, be sure to be brief and check out with your client how the skill is received. 

01:08:00
Maintaining balance in a complex world. 

01:08:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Hey, Billy, how are you?

01:08:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good, good, nice to see you. You know, you said you had some concerns you like to share with me today. 

01:08:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah uhm, I, I, I wanted to just talk a little bit about uhm, some challenges I'm having with work. That's really not work per se, but it's just some things around the work, uhm, sort of a lot that I'm dealing with. 

01:08:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. You know, Billy, before you begin to discuss all that, maybe we should talk about what it's like for you to come here talking to me, a white European-American, Swedish-American and the cultural differences, is there anything that ah, I should be aware of to make this a better session? 

01:08:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm, well, I appreciate you mentioning it... (crosstalk) 

01:08:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...uhm, I guess even your saying that makes me feel better because at least you're conscious of it, you know. 

01:08:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I surely am, and I want you to be sure to let me know if I'm on track all the way, and if I'm not, we should stop and feel free to say something to me... (crosstalk) 

01:09:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS That's good. 

01:09:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...because I wanna learn too. I want to learn about, and I want to be helpful to you in whatever way I can and that's a very important issue to me and then... (crosstalk) 

01:09:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:09:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...I just want uhm, want you to let me know uhm, when we need to move or be in a different track. 

01:09:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Oh good, good. 

01:09:15
How do you react to the disclosure of the issue? 

01:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Okay, well let's go on. 

01:09:20
Concreteness-seeking specific example 

01:09:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Maybe you could tell me just a little bit more about the ah, concern that you have, or an example of what's going on. 

01:09:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well ah, the challenge that I'm having is that I ah, have just ah, recently taking, taken on a new position... (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:09:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...sort of a responsible role ah, but it requires me to commute to the place of business. It's an hour and a half each way uhm, and of course I have all the bells and whistles. I've got car phone and the pager, and the dicta-phone, and all this on, you know, tapes on book and all that kind of business, you know, that ah, to sort of ease the, ease it, but it just feels like an awful lot, especially uhm, I find in the evening because I tend to get involved with what I'm doing... (crosstalk) 

01:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

01:10:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  and ah, five o'clock, it's five-thirty, six o'clock, seven o'clock rolls around and I'm still involved, and it's an hour and a half home... (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm. 

01:10:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...so if I'm finished at seven o'clock, where I'm accustomed to only being 15 minutes or 20 minutes or half hour from home... (crosstalk) 

01:10:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...which is not bad. 

01:10:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:10:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS An hour and a half means I don't get home until eight thirty, nine o'clock and sometimes later. 

01:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:30
Note encourages often enough to keep verbal client talking. 

01:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:10:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And it's really ah, it's really beginning to wear on me. 

01:10:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You're starting to feel... 

01:10:40
Feedback on positive assets and strengths 

01:10:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY The fatigue from having an and, and doing all as much work, you know, you were such a responsible person and that's, ah, really wonderful that you have this responsible job and, ah, new position, but the idea of, after doing all this working, extending yourself as much as you can, then you still have to get in your car and drive an hour and a half and that feels a bit much. 

01:11:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS It is a, it is a, it's a lot. 

01:11:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's a lot. 

01:11:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS It's a lot. 

01:11:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:11:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS I also, you know, have the experience that ah, in the organization that I'm in, ah... 

01:11:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And I'm fairly high placed, you know, highly placed in the organization... (crosstalk) 

01:11:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, ah, that, ah, I want to somehow be ah, a model for others... (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...in terms of the kind of ah, ah, the level on the intensity of the work. 

01:11:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm, and, ah, I find that there are bit of a couple times when I felt fatigued then I decided I'd leave right at five o'clock... (crosstalk) 

01:11:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and on, all the way home I thought, "Gee, I really, maybe that's not such a good idea." 

01:11:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, and so you feel sort of torn between staying there and wanting to be with the family and, and ah, I certainly could identify what that too, Billy(ph). Years ago... (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:11:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...I had a job... 

01:11:50
Self-disclosure and supportive confrontation of major conflict 

01:11:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Where I have to commute to and ah, through heavy traffic. It was only an hour, but, but the desire to be home with the family and not to work so hard and yet the desire to be, to do good in the job, that's, that's what pulled you in both ways until you almost feel torn. 

01:12:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Hmm, yeah. There is, there is a real conflict in, in terms of wanting to be responsible... (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, in terms of uhm, ah, my professional responsibilities... (crosstalk) 

01:12:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...the desire to achieve, very high desire to achieve... (crosstalk) 

01:12:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:12:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and also the real uhm, desire to make sure that I'm fulfilling my responsibilities at home and really being there and be present... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:12:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and ah, it doesn't, it's not working the way I want it to work. 

01:12:35
Portions of session deleted: The session continues 

01:12:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Billy, what else is going on in your life as we're talking about these different things? Would you share anything else that might (inaudible ) 

01:12:46
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well, I've uhm, actually you see in me made a lot of changes... (crosstalk) 

01:12:46
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...uhm, and one of the changes I've made, ah, is, ah, has to do with the amount of time that I have committed to traveling uhm, in service to my religious community... (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, where I worship almost every week and I was traveling some place. 

01:13:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And after a, a long period of time, 10 years of doing that particular work, ah, which was a wonderful work... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

01:13:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...I decided that I would adjust that so that I will be able to be more available to my children... (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...on the weekend as they're getting in to an age where they really sort of need me... (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, so I want to be more involved with family life and closer to those things. (crosstalk) 

01:13:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS We're a very close family. We do a lot of things together, so it's, there's not, it's not that there are problems or difficulties. Its just I've really felt that, ah, there was more ah, need for me, my presence, my physical presence. 

01:13:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  So you felt a need for you, yeah, with your, the family needing you... (crosstalk) 

01:13:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah. 

01:13:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...at this point and, and (inaudible ). 

01:13:49
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS And it's not only the family needing me, but I needed, I needed to be there for me as well. 

01:13:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You needed to be there- 

01:13:55
Confrontation building on positive strengths 

01:13:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And so maybe that might be a phase that uhm, and then you have this wonderful strength to be uhm, with your church community and now it's maybe a, a phase where it's now time to move on to your family... (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...this community and, and more, a closer, ah, community. 

01:14:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But ah. 

01:14:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well it's ah, you know I really, my uhm, religious convictions are very strong... (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  ah, then really sustain me, and I think, I think they really help me to, to ah, to, ah, to do as much as I do. And one of the things that they, the teachings have, have led me to uhm, to ah, in realize and acknowledge is how, how critical and how important it is to really ensure that the family unit is really, really tight. And so all the external things that I do ah, while they are wonderful, I have to make sure that I invest a lot in that family unit. 

01:14:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, and that family is really, really important to you and... (crosstalk) 

01:15:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS It's very important to me. 

01:15:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and that's, this strength and the resource that you drawn along with your religion... (crosstalk) 

01:15:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah. 

01:15:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...and they both ah, come together. 

01:15:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah. You know as I'm thinking about it, Mary, you know you ah, you mentioning that helps me to perhaps understand a little bit more about why the commuter's so frustrated, because it feels like three hours a day, times five days a week, is 15 hours a week. You know for a lot of people, that's a part time job. 

01:15:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:15:30
The field has tended to ignore spiritual issue, but is now opening itself to possibilities. How do you feel about this topic? The session continues with Mary self-disclosing. How do you react? 

01:15:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uhm, I just guess I'd like to share with you- 

01:15:45
Self-disclosure with check-out returning focus to client 

01:15:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That, that my religion and my, my spiritual journey is very important to me also, and I bring that back to my family and, and ah, I see the two sort of intertwined and I'm just wondering how family, I mean family and church or family and spirituality together, I'm just wondering how that fits with you and what you think of that? 

01:16:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Yeah, I, I ah, I really appreciate knowing that you, you share those kinds of concerns and interest... (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and it makes me feel like, uhm, ah, I'm not alone with that. 

01:16:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:16:25
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm, that in fact uhm, really the spiritual journey, uhm, if its fully incorporated, internalized you know... (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:30
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...in one's, one's life... (crosstalk) 

01:16:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and it's not a some sort of separate entities, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:16:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...there's family and then there's work and then there's, you know, religious beliefs... (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...uhm, but that they're all integrated, then it really makes one's life more fulfilled, more wholesome, and you feel that the path is clearer. So it makes, you know it occurs to me, it makes this is why I questioned or I'm having the conflict about the traveler, about the, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:17:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...these different kinds of things because I'm struggling for this kind of, (crosstalk) 

01:17:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS to make this, this whole integrated process. 

01:17:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Maybe you just need to, to illuminate the commute, to move closer. 

01:17:10
Debriefing: Multicultural Issues 

01:17:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  I've joined Mary and Billy because there's a lot of things that happened in this short tape. The feedback skill and the self-disclosure still have been demonstrated but there's been some very, I'd say, well, for counseling are relatively unusual issues have been explored and it's best to debrief them. Ah, you may notice that, ah, Mary started very early on with the sharing the idea that here she is a white ah, woman, even a blonde, working on African-American and ah, I was wondering what's Billy's thoughts were about that and ah, I noticed it wasn't followed up on is what you're, what, what your reactions toward it? 

01:17:50
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Well I appreciated her, one, acknowledging it in the ah, a non ah, explosive kind of way. She didn't make a big to do about it. 

01:18:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm, and uhm, and invited me to sort of ah, if you will, correct or adjust something... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:18:05
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...that she said if it felt uhm, inappropriate. 

01:18:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS But it never came up and I think part of why it never came up was because she did acknowledge it and the option was there. 

01:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And it would've come up, then, this provides the opening for the dialogue. (crosstalk) 

01:18:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:18:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

01:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY How did you feel ah, bringing it up, Mary? 

01:18:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It felt, it felt okay because I think if we don't bring it up, it's an, it's an issue. It's something that I might have in my mind and wondering how he's reacting to me and wondering if I might be saying something wrong so I guess I, I, I'd rather feel better bringing it up at the beginning rather than it didn't happen, not talked about. 

01:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, okay. 

01:18:35
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, a second issue that came up was the issue of spirituality, ah, the American Counseling Association has developed a set of spiritual competencies and they say that we're gonna need to be aware of the strength as the issue of spirituality in counseling at the same time, you don't want to take over and move too far at that. In our discussion after this tape, there is an interesting discussion about church ah, where, where use the word church, Bible, Torah, ah, whether you talk about ah, symbolism or perhaps the more generic issue of spirituality, and Billy, I thought you have some real interesting thoughts about that as we talk. 

01:19:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS You know, I, I think it's really important, ah, especially in the helping process... (crosstalk) 

01:19:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...that we used generic ah, generic expressions, and the reason for that is the people who we are working with uhm, may have any unique combination of uhm, orientations or expressions or religious traditions. And so if, in my experience, I, you know, if I'm not a Christian and I use Christian ah, and you use Christian symbolism... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:19:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...ah, then I can distance me, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay. 

01:19:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uhm, but there is a commonness around belief in a ah, a supreme being, (crosstalk) 

01:19:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS  you know, so that uhm, you know, ah, I, my, my concern was that... (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS If you use expressions that are an indication of one's particular belief system or another... (crosstalk) 

01:20:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...then that can distance people. 

01:20:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:00
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS But that, if you use more generic expressions, someone who is an atheist to someone who's a, an, an agnostic to someone who is a believer in any specific... (crosstalk) 

01:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Belief system, uhm, worldwide can relate to the theme of spirituality and can relate to that journey... (crosstalk) 

01:20:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...and one's uhm, belief... (crosstalk) 

01:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS ...in a higher power, et cetera. 

01:20:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:20:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Ah, so that uhm, ah, you know there is an, a notion that one is better than the other. 

01:20:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Right. 

01:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY There's also, even the word religion of, ah, for some people is a, is a, is a troubling word so generally speaking, spirituality. I know when I was working with Japan, you have a, a group which relieve, ah, the Shinto tradition, really... (crosstalk) 

01:20:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:20:40
ALLEN E. IVEY ...they work in a more earth-centered relationship... (crosstalk) 

01:20:40
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS That's right. 

01:20:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...uh hmm. 

01:20:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  To the land and ah... (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS That's right. 

01:20:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...uh hmm. 

01:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, the notions of supreme being and so it becomes very, very different, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:20:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY ...so we, working with, with people who might be different from us, I think it's, it's good to follow that line... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, and use (inaudible ). How did you feel about, ah, these issues, Mary? 

01:21:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, I understand what you're saying and I think it is important to use terms that make everybody feel comfortable in, in spirituality and higher being and beliefs, some things like this is more, it would be more generic than... (crosstalk) 

01:21:10
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

01:21:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...than other terms. 

01:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, sign off, unless either of you want anything to add to this? 

01:21:15
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS Good. 

01:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. 

01:21:20
WILLIAM L.H. ROBERTS I like working with you, Mary. 

01:21:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I like working with you too, Billy. 

01:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm both watching the two of you.
