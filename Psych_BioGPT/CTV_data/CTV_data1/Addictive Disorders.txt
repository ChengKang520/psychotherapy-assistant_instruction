DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:05
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 

00:00:05
ADDICTIVE DISORDERS 

00:00:15
SIOBHAN DOHERTY The human mind can be altered by any number of substances. These may be medications used to treat illness, infection, or even some of the mental disorders that we’ve looked at elsewhere in this series. They can be components of the food or beverages we consume that may change our cognition or behavior, or they can even be substances used to intentionally affect our behavior or perceptions of the world. However, any number of mind-altering substances can be used to the point that they cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment, leading to possible intoxication, abuse, addiction and withdrawal. This is the case for those who experience Addictive Disorders, also known as Substance-related and Addictive Disorders. These individuals may have their cognition, perceptions or physiology debilitated in reversible or irreversible ways. They may continue to use these substances, even when they experience clusters of negative effects. And they may become so dependent on a substance that even when they try to cease or reduce their use, they experience additional behavioral or cognitive consequences. Substance-related disorders are part of a larger grouping of disorders called substance-related and addictive disorders codified and defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5. These disorders share a common trait of activating the brain's reward system by a substance or addiction, and the individuals with these disorders continue their use and behavior, whether or not they recognize it as a problem. 

00:01:55
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:02:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY There are a number of distinct addictive disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. The diagnostic codes correspond to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is first linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with the codes for ICD-10 listed in parentheses. Hence, all of the DSM codes crosswalk to the ICD codes, including the newest iteration ICD-10. For example, Alcohol Use Disorder, with mild severity, is assigned the code 305.00 from ICD-9 and F10.10 in parentheses from ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10-was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States although it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10 is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 codes in parentheses. Most of the other diagnosis delineated in the DSM-5 chapter on substance use disorders are organized by substance and are based upon if the patient is displaying symptoms of substance use, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal or other substance-based effects. Organizationally, there are few differences between the layouts of DSM-5 and ICD-10. In their F10–F19 block on Mental and Behavioral Disorders due to psychoactive substance use, ICD-10 similarly organizes these disorders based on the substance in use. They do however differ in the subdivisions used. For ICD-10, each substance can additionally be codified by acute intoxication, harmful use, dependence syndrome, withdrawal state, withdrawal state with delirium, psychotic disorder, amnesic syndrome, residual and late onset psychotic disorder, other mental and behavioral disorders and unspecified mental and behavioral disorders. DSM-5’s subdivisions include many of those previously mentioned in our list of disorders such as substance use, intoxication and withdrawal, severity, mild, medium, severe, with or without perceptual disturbances, etc. We will cover all these in more detail throughout the program. While all the intricacies of these organizational differences between DSM-5 and ICD-10 go beyond the scope of this program, familiarity with the subdivisions in both ICD-10 and DSM-5 can help a clinician have a greater understanding of the substance use disorders and the ways in which they can manifest in different individuals. One other difference is in gambling disorder or pathological gambling, an addictive disorder that is included in ICD-10’s F60-F69 block on Disorders of Adult Personality and Behavior, specifically, F63 on Habit and Impulse Disorders. This highlights the uncontrollable, harmful and impulsive nature of this disorder as we’ll explore later in this program. 

00:05:30
SUBSTANCE-RELATED 

00:05:30
DISORDERS 

00:05:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Before we go into the fundamental characteristics of each grouping of substances, we will first generally explore the three large categories of substance-related disorders: substance use disorders, substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. 

00:05:50
SUBSTANCE ABUSE 

00:06:00
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Substance Abuse, also called substance use disorder, goes beyond simply an occasional or one-time use of a substance and is defined as a continued pattern of use. This can continue to the point that it changes brain circuitry so that the effects may last even during withdrawal. As mentioned, this use leads to clinically significant distress or functional impairment as manifested by the following characteristics though not all of them will be present for every substance. When it comes to the actual use of the substance, there are a multitude of behaviors that may indicate substance abuse. The individual may use the substance despite the physical dangers of doing so. They may also ignore physical or psychological issues and continue using the substance despite the likelihood that the substance caused or exacerbated the problems. The individual may also spend a considerable amount of time trying to obtain the substance, using the substance or recovering from it. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Beer. You want? 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN No, I’m okay. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Okay. It’s you are missing up as I said. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I know. You say that every time. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Hmm-hmm. That’s because it’s true. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Have you been drinking all day? 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. It’s, you know, Saturday. So I’m… yeah. What’s up? What’s wrong? 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Ah, I told myself I would say something next time. So I’m going to say it… 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Say, say something. All right. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. I… I’m really concerned about the amount that you’re drinking. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN You’re concerned about the amount of… oh, boy. So you… 

00:07:40
SIOBHAN DOHERTY There are a number of characteristics that involve the individual's intentions when it comes to the substance. They may consistently want or unsuccessfully tried to taper their use. They may also use more of the substance than intended or for a longer time than intended. The continued use may also cause the patient to neglect occupational or personal obligations to give up important activities or to experience social or interpersonal problems due to the effects of use. Some of the characteristics are physiological such as developing a tolerance defined by either needing more of the substance to get the same effects or finding that using the same amount of the substance leads to diminished effects. The individual may also feel a strong need to use the substance or they may experience withdrawal. It should be noted that withdrawal symptoms are most prominent with opioids and sedatives, anxiolytics, alcohol, and hypnotics whereas they're not as noticeable in tobacco, stimulants, amphetamines and cocaine and cannabis. However, withdrawal is not included as a symptom for individuals taking phencyclidine, inhalants or other hallucinogens because withdrawal symptoms have not been documented. If the patient meets 2 or 3 of the characteristics, the clinician can indicate that the patient is experiencing substance use with mild severity. There are two other levels of severity. 4 to 5 symptoms indicates moderate severity and 6 or more symptoms suggests severe. There are other possible specifiers that the clinician can indicate. For all sets of substance use, the possible specifiers are in early remission, in sustained remission and in a controlled environment. The specifier in early remission indicates a patient who has previously qualified for an addictive disorder hasn't met any of the characteristics for at least three months and less than 12 months though this specifier does allow for the individual still experiencing cravings for the respective substance. If the patient hasn't met the characteristics for a period of longer than 12 months, the specifier in sustained remission is appropriate. If the patient is in an environment where they have restricted access to the substance, the clinician can use the specifier in a controlled environment. For both opioid use disorder and tobacco use disorder, the specifier on maintenance therapy can be used when the patient takes another medication to help mitigate the effects of the substance used assuming the medication doesn't qualify for the substance use disorder it aims to alleviate.

DISORDERS:

SUBSTANCE INTOXICATION 

00:10:25
AND 

00:10:25
SUBSTANCE WITHDRAWAL 

00:10:30
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Unlike substance use, substance intoxication can happen if an individual uses the substance just once. It is important to recognize that there is a difference between intoxication in a physiological sense and a diagnosis of substance intoxication. The key to diagnosis is that the ingestion of the substance leads to behavioral or psychological changes that warrant clinical attention. For example, an individual who gets an extra boost of energy from a cup of coffee in the morning but experiences no problematic effects from it may be experiencing caffeine intoxication in a physiological sense, but not in a clinical sense. The actual characteristics of substance intoxication will vary depending not only on the substance, but also on the consistency and the length of use. Short-term intoxications may present differently than long-term or chronic use. Because of this variety, we will explore the intoxication effects for each substance throughout this program, but the main underlying feature of substance intoxication is that after the substance is ingested, a set of reversible characteristics indicative of the particular substance develops. Substance withdrawal similarly varies between substances though its symptoms commonly include alteration in mood, abnormal motor activity, sleep disturbances, and other physiological problems. Substance withdrawal occurs when lengthy and heavy use of the substance is ceased or reduced causing clinically significant distress or impairment. These problematic symptoms can arise anywhere from a few hours to several days after the cessation or reduction. For many of the substances, the coding for intoxication or withdrawal may partially depend on whether the patient symptoms come with perceptual disturbances. This is indicated if the patient experiences either hallucinations with intact reality testing or illusions, whether visual, auditory or tactile without experiencing delirium. For all substances, there is also the possibility of other substance-induced disorders for additional disorders related to a particular substance and unspecified substance-related disorders, which are four problematic conditions that nonetheless don't meet the characteristics of another diagnosis. Because of the variety and symptoms for substance specific use in intoxication and withdrawal, we will spend the majority of the remainder of this program looking at each category of substance and exploring any additional unique or relevant characteristics. 

00:13:15
ALCOHOL USE, 

00:13:15
INTOXICATION AND 

00:13:15
WITHDRAWAL 

00:13:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Alcohol use is quite common, especially with young adults. Hence, special care must be given in defining clinically significant symptoms that meet diagnosis. The 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is around 5% prevalence in teens 12 to 17 years old and from 5 to 15% in adults 18 or older. It is more common in men than women. Genetics also play a role in a disorder. The condition is 3 to 4 times more likely in an individual with relatives who have substance use disorder. If an individual has a first-degree relative with the disorder, then the risk of developing alcohol use disorder increases from 8% to 25%. It shares the fundamental characteristics of the other substance use disorders previously mentioned. The markers of alcohol intoxication are ones that most of us are likely familiar with. A diagnosis may involve any of the following symptoms which, as with all of the substance intoxication disorders, must be problematic. These are unsteady gait, unclear speech, aggression, nystagmus or uncontrolled repetitive eye movement, incoordination, impairment of judgment memory or focus, and stupor or coma. Alcohol can sometimes cause amnesia like symptoms during the course of intoxication, commonly known as blackouts. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include, but are not limited to, sweating, or high pulse rate, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations and anxiety. 

00:15:00
CAFFEINE INTOXICATION 

00:15:00
AND WITHDRAWAL 

00:15:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY As with alcohol use, special care must be given in diagnosing caffeine related disorders as it is unlikely that coffee, soda, energy drinks, chocolate and other ingestibles containing caffeine would cause significant enough distress to warrant a diagnosis of substance use. Still caffeine can cause intoxication. Diagnosing intoxication involves most of the following symptoms, some of which might be associated with the wired sensation of being over caffeinated. Symptoms include red face, rambling speech, rapid heart rate and twitching muscles, as well as agitation and excitement. The individual may experience insomnia. There can be an increase in the production of urine, as well as gastrointestinal problems. Caffeine withdrawal entails a group of symptoms appearing within 24 hours after caffeine use has ceased. These individuals may have flu like symptoms such as headaches or nausea, as well as difficulty concentrating, increased fatigue, and depressed mood or irritability. While it is unclear how many individuals in the general population experience caffeine withdrawal, the FDA estimates that around 80% of adults consume caffeine daily in the United States and more than 70% may experience at least one symptom of caffeine withdrawal upon attempts at permanent cessation of caffeine. 

00:16:30
CANNABIS USE, 

00:16:30
INTOXICATION 

00:16:30
AND WITHDRAWAL 

00:16:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY As of 2015, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of medical cannabis. Even though it is legalized and hence controlled to a certain extent, up to 4% of American adults may experience a cannabis related disorder. It is helpful to note that this is not officially linked to medical marijuana per se, and so careful attention must be given in this aspect. The characteristic features of cannabis use are the same as the features mentioned for the previous categories of substance use. Among the problematic behavioral and psychological changes for an individual with cannabis intoxication are a feeling of time slowing down, impaired motor coordination, lethargy, impaired judgment, euphoria, and social withdrawal. Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms of cannabis intoxication, especially in first-time users. Individuals may experience additional symptoms including dry mouth, red eyes, increased hunger and increased heart rate. Cannabis withdrawal occurs after stopping heavy and continued use. This can lead to depressed mood, aggression, difficulty in sleeping, reduction in appetite, anxiety and physical symptoms, causing significant discomfort. 

00:18:00
SEDATIVE, HYPNOTIC 

00:18:00
AND ANXIOLYTIC USE, 

00:18:00
INTOXICATION AND 

00:18:00
WITHDRAWAL 

00:18:00
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Sedative, Hypnotic and Anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, carbonates and barbiturates, as well as benzodiazepine-like drugs and barbiturate-like hypnotics. Essentially, this means every prescription drug for sleep, and almost every prescription antianxiety medication. This category of drugs can be obtained illegally or by prescription and as depressants, they have similar effects to alcohol. Before looking further at their effects, it is useful to define sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics. Sedatives are any substance that produce a calm mood of reduced excitement. A hypnotic is used to help an individual sleep. An anxiolytic is a drug that reduces anxiety. Sedative, hypnotic and anxiolytic intoxication includes characteristics similar to alcohol use. Impaired judgment, incoordination, cognition impairment, mood lability, unclear speech, memory issues, lack of balance, nystagmus, and overtly sexual or overly aggressive behavior. Withdrawal include high pulse rate, tremors in the hand, high blood pressure, hallucinations or illusions, sweating, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, psychomotor tension and grand mal seizures. 

00:19:30
HALLUCINOGEN-RELATED 

00:19:30
DISORDERS 

00:19:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Hallucinogen is a bit of a misnomer as these disorders rarely produce actual hallucinations. Well, ICD-10 uses the term hallucinogen for all the hallucinogen related disorders. DSM-5 breaks them into two larger sections depending on the type of hallucinogen used. Phencyclidine disorder entails use of Phencyclidine, commonly known as PCP or Angel Dust and other similar compounds, including Ketamine. Other hallucinogen disorders account for the use of any other hallucinogens, including Phenylethylamine, such as Mescaline, Psilocybin, LSD, MDMA or ecstasy, MDA, Dimethyltryptamine or DMT and morning glory seeds. While these substances have different chemical structures, they are grouped together due to their similar effects. On the other hand, cannabis and its active chemical compound THC share some similar hallucinogen effects. But they also include other distinct characteristics, so separate diagnosis is warranted. As mentioned previously, withdrawal from hallucinogens has not been significantly documented in human beings, and so it isn’t an aspect of Phencyclidine use disorder or other hallucinogen use disorder. There is some evidence of it with MDMA however. Phencyclidine shares traits of both stimulants and depressants. It can produce psychotic symptoms almost indistinguishable from schizophrenia. Phencyclidine intoxication can result in behavioral changes, such as unpredictability, aggression, psychomotor agitation, impulsiveness, and impaired judgment. There may also be muscle rigidity, nystagmus, numbness, hypertension or tachycardia, hyperacusis, ataxia, and seizures or coma. These can arise within an hour after use, though this can be faster depending on which method is used to ingest the substance. Fundamental characteristics of other hallucinogen intoxication can include significant anxiety or depression, the fear of going crazy and paranoid ideas. Other characteristics of other hallucinogen intoxication include rapid heart rate or heart palpitations, pupillary dilation, sweating, tremors, unclear vision and incoordination.

Perception Disorder: 

00:22:10
F16.983(292.89) 

00:22:15
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Hallucinogen related disordersv includes another additional disorder, Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, commonly known as Flashbacks. This occurs when use of a hallucinogen is ceased leading to the reemergence of symptoms that were initially experienced while intoxicated. Visual disturbances are the most prevalent, but flashbacks may include other perceptual disturbances. The individual may see flashes of color, have geometric hallucinations, see artificial movement in their periphery, trails, Macropsia where things appear enlarged or Micropsia where things appear smaller. Brief flashbacks are common for more than half of hallucinogen users, but the persistent and problematic features of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder are rare since individuals were able to subdue and proceed with usual functioning. 

00:23:15
INHALANT USE 

00:23:15
AND INTOXICATION 

00:23:15
Inhalant Intoxication 

00:23:15
F18.129(292.89) 

00:23:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Inhalants are volatile hydrocarbons, toxic gases that include paints, glues, fuels and other volatile compounds. The inhalant used is often a mixture of compounds, but where there is a clear unmixed substance used, the clinician should specify the particular inhalant as part of their diagnosis. As with hallucinogens, withdrawal is not an aspect of diagnosis. Impaired judgment, aggressiveness, assaultiveness and apathy are aspects of the problematic changes that can happen in inhalant intoxication. Some of the other characteristics may be similar to alcohol intoxication, nystagmus, unsteady stance, incoordination, unclear speech and stupor or coma. Others include dizziness, euphoria, lethargy, psychomotor retardation, tremor, and muscle weakness. 

00:24:25
OPIOID USE, 

00:24:25
INTOXICATION 

00:24:25
AND WITHDRAWAL 

00:24:25
Opioid Use Disorder: 

00:24:25
F11.20(304.00) 

00:24:30
SIOBHAN DOHERTY While non-medical opioid use, including substances such as heroin decreased from 2003 to 2013, there was a marked increase in medical opioids during the same period. These include medications such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and morphine. This increase has been called by some an opioid epidemic. However, as with cannabis, since opioid is used by some states for medical purposes, it is important to take this into consideration when providing a diagnosis. Opioid use disorder has the same fundamental characteristics as the other substance use disorders we’ve looked at. It does however feature the additional specifier on maintenance therapy. One of the markers of opioid intoxication is that the initial elated feelings are followed by changes in psychomotor functioning, dysphoria, apathy or impaired judgment. The individual also experiences pupillary constriction or dilation in the case of severe overdose. This is accompanied by attention or memory issues, drowsiness or coma, or unclear speech. The symptoms for opioid withdrawal are flu like, though without cough or sore throat with the individual experiencing nausea and vomiting, rhinorrhea or lacrimation, fever, sweating, yawning, dysphoria, insomnia, muscle aches and pains and diarrhea. This can happen if the patient ceases using the opioid after at least several weeks of continuous heavy use, or if an opioid antagonist is administered causing withdrawal symptoms to be induced almost immediately. 

00:26:20
STIMULANT-RELATED 

00:26:20
DISORDERS 

00:26:20
Stimulant Use Disorder: 

00:26:20
F14.10(305.60) 

00:26:20
Stimulant Withdrawal: 

00:26:20
F14.23(292.0) 

00:26:20
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Stimulants are a class of drugs that cause temporary increases in alertness, mood and wakefulness. DSM-5 breaks stimulants down into three different types, each with their own diagnostic codes: amphetamine type substance, cocaine and other or unspecified stimulant. In addition to drugs such as Methamphetamine, Amphetamines may include prescription drugs such as Methylphenidate, Ritalin or Amphetamine combinations, Adderall. These prescription drugs may be used to potentially treat obesity, some depressive disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, they can also be abused or obtained illegally. Cocaine entails substances in all of cocaine's various preparations such as cocaine alkaloids, including freebase and crack as well as coca leaves and cocaine hydrochloride. The key is that cocaine is the active ingredient. While the modes of ingestion and length of active symptoms can vary depending on the stimulant used, the intoxication and withdrawal effects are quite similar and so are grouped together in DSM-5. For stimulant intoxication, the individual can experience a range of symptoms, which may include hypervigilance, repetitive speech or movement, positive and negative mood changes, changes in sociability, anxiety and impaired judgment. The individual may also experience weight loss, sweating and chills, dilated pupils, changes in blood pressure and heart rate, seizures, nausea, confusion, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and muscular weakness or coma. Withdrawal includes a dysphoric mood with excessive hunger, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, nightmares, and problems sleeping, which can manifest from a few hours to several days after the use of stimulant was ceased or reduced.

Tobacco withdrawal: 

00:28:30
F17.203(292.0) 

00:28:35
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Unlike the rest of the substance classes, there is no code for Nicotine intoxication as it is incredibly rare. Nicotine also doesn't produce the same effects such as euphoria of other substances, yet it is highly addictive. Tobacco use disorder has the same characteristics as the other substance use disorders though because of its easy availability and lack of intoxicating effects, there will likely be little time spent trying to obtain it or to recover from its effects. With tobacco withdrawal, many patients may report that the predominant symptom they’re experiencing is a craving for more tobacco. This can sometimes overshadow the other characteristics of agitation, irritability, hunger, insomnia, anxiety, depression and impaired concentration.

F19.20(304.90) 

00:29:30
SIOBHAN DOHERTY There is also the possibility that the patient is experiencing problematic behavioral or psychological changes due to a substance that doesn't fit within one of the other substance categories. These can include anabolic steroids, Nitrous oxide or other prescription drugs. For this, the clinician can diagnose other (or unknown) substance use intoxication and withdrawal. The characteristics for use, intoxication and withdrawal in these cases closely matches the other substance-related disorders.

NON-SUBSTANCE-RELATED 

00:30:05
DISORDER: 

00:30:05
PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLING 

00:30:10
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Because of the similar activation of reward centers, pathological gambling is included in the addictive disorders. Gambling can be a common activity that nonetheless may produce a feeling of euphoria or arousal in some individuals. If this leads to clinical distress within a 12 month period, the individual may be experiencing pathological gambling. If 4 to 5 characteristics are met, the clinician can indicate mild, between 6 and 7, moderate, and 8 to 9, severe. They may turn to gambling during times of stress and after losing they will often return to gambling to try and make up for the loss. The gambling can cause them relationships and jobs. They may wish to hide this from their family or others, and may also have to borrow money from others when they find themselves in dire financial situations. There's a preoccupation with gambling with the individual starts often turning toward past experiences or circumstances related to gambling. An individual may also develop a sort of tolerance so that increasingly more and more money needs to be on the line to produce the same effects. Attempts to stop gambling may result in agitation or mood changes. These attempts to quit may be repeated unsuccessfully. The clinician can specify if this behavior is episodic, meaning after the individual qualifies for diagnosis, he or she will have periods of at least several months of symptom remission. If the characteristics are met continuously for several years, the clinician can specify persistent. The effects of these substances or behaviors can vary in their severity and the extent of problems they cause in individuals’ lives. However, for some individuals, without help, these problems may only increase. In part, because of this, being familiar with the markers of these disorders can allow the clinician to recognize the substance or trigger in question and subsequently give a diagnosis. This diagnosis may offer the first step in the treatment process, putting the patient on the path to live a healthier, more balanced life.
