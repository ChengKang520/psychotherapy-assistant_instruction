BERNHARD TRENKLE So it's, uhm, a great honor for me to introduce Daniel Amen. He is a psychiatrist and bestselling author. He's a brain scanning, ah, specialist. He is specialized in showing us how the brain-- ah, how-- what we can learn from brain scan for behavior and what we also can learn as psychotherapist that is a-- that is the title of his presentation, brain wars, how not looking at the brain leads to misdiagnosis and failed treatments and dangerous behavior. I mentioned alre-- already he's a bestselling, uhm, from someday-- I heard some people told me this new book will be on number one in New York best, ah, uhm, New York Times best seller list. It's Daniel Plan 40 days to a healthier life. So maybe it's in the bookshop I assume. So Daniel please.

Maverick 1972... How do you know unless you look? 1979... I fell in love with psychiatry because it has potential to change generations Brain SPECT Imaging 

00:01:10
DANIEL AMEN Thank you so much. I am so excited to be with you. Uhm, so my topic is brain wars, how not looking at the brain leads misdiagnosis, failed treatments and dangerous behaviors. But I wanna give you a little context to the war. So, uhm, I am in the middle of seven children. Growing up my father called me Maverick and to him that was not a good thing. In 1972, ah, the United States has a draft and my draft number was 19 which meant I was going to be drafted so I joined, ah, the army and became an infantry medic. And there my love for medicine was born. But very quickly I learned that I did not like sleeping in the mud or the idea of being shoot at and so I got myself retrained as an x-ray technician and that's where my love of imaging was born. As our professors used to say, " How do you know unless you look?" In 1979 I was a second year medical student at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma and someone very close to me became suicidal and tried to kill herself. Horrified, I brought her to a very good psychiatrist at the department of psychiatry at ORU. And I realized that if he helped her, which he did, it would not only help her but it would help her husband, her children, and even her grandchildren as they would influenced by someone who is happier and more stable. I fell in love with psychiatry because I realized it has potential to change generations of people. Fast forward to 1991 and I went to my first lecture on brain SPECT imaging. SPECT is a nuclear medicine study that looks the blood flow and activity, it looks at how you're brain works. The doctor who gave us the lecture said that SPECT was a tool to give psychiatrist more information to help their patients in that one lecture. My two professional loves came together, imaging and psychiatry and quite frankly revolutionized my life. Over the next 22 years, my colleagues and I would build the world's largest state of a-- is the brain scans related to behavior now over 85,000 scans on people from 93 countries. 

00:04:30
Healthy Brain SPECT Scans Surface View Active View Healthy vs 2 Strokes Healthy Stroke Healthy vs Alzheimer's Disease Healthy Alzheimer's Healthy vs Traumatic Brain Injury Healthy TBI Healthy vs Drug Abuse Healthy Drug Affected 

00:04:30
DANIEL AMEN Uhm, here two SPECT scans. SPECT looks at blood flow and activity, it looks at how your brain works. The image on the left looks at the outside surface of the brain, a healthy scan shows full even symmetrical activity that color is not important, it's the shape that matters. The image on the right, red equals the areas of high activity in the brain which in a healthy scanner typically in the back bottom part of the brain in an area called the cerebellum that has half of the brains neurons. So compare a healthy scan to someone two strokes. You can see the wholes of activity, or someone who has Alzheimer's disease where the back half of the brain is deteriorating. Did you know that Alzheimer's disease actually starts in your brain, 30 to 50 years before you have any symptoms. So for those of you who are waiting to lose your memory to get healthy, you might wanna rethink that position. Here's the scan of someone who had a traumatic brain injury. Your brain is soft about the consistency of soft butter. Your skull is really hard and has many sharp bony ridges. We're going to talk about traumatic brain injury. Here is the scan of someone who abuse drugs. When I first started doing imaging, I was the director a dual diagnosis unit, they had terrible looking scans. I brought them home to my four children and effectively induced anxiety disorders in all four of them when it came to drug abuse. 

00:06:20
Healthy vs OCD Healthy OCD Healthy vs Bipolar Disorder Healthy Bipolar Disorder 1992... All Day Conference on SPECT in Psychiatry Researchers Complain Scans Only for Research For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 Without Imaging 

00:06:20
DANIEL AMEN Here is a scan of someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder where the front part of the brain works too hard so they cannot let of negative thoughts. And this is a scan of someone who has bipolar disorder. The first year of ordering scans I'm so excited because I had new tool to help my patients. In 1992, I went to an all day conference on brain SPECT imaging at the American Psychiatric Association and met colleagues who are doing the same work from Creighton University and it was thrilling for me. Yet, at that same conference, researches were complaining that psychiatrist like me, clinical psychiatrist like me should not be doing imaging, they were only for their research. Being a maverick, I just thought that was the damndest idea on the planet, and would have no part of their mindset. Why? Because psychiatrist today 1992 when I went that lecture and even in 2013 make diagnosis exactly like they did in 1840 when Abraham Lincoln was depressed, think about it. So Lincoln has several very serious episodes of depression and then in the winter of 1840, he went to see Dr. Anson Henry. And how did Dr. Henry diagnosed him with depression? He looked at him, talked to him and looked for symptom clusters. Isn't that exactly the way me make diagnosis and mental health? That's psychotic. 

00:08:10
Psychiatrists only medical specialists who rarely look at organ they treat > Cardiologists look > Neurologists look > Orthopedists look > All other specialties look > Psychiatrists guess There is a reason most psychiatric medications have "Black Box" warnings ! FDA BLACK BOX WARNING Before Imaging 

00:08:15
DANIEL AMEN Did you know psychiatrists are the only medical specialist who virtually never look at the organ they think. Cardiologists look, neurologists look, orthopedic doctors look, every other medical specialty looks, psychiatrist guess. You know I might? Think about that. Why are we so special? The reason that most psychiatric medications have block box warnings is they hurt people. The FDA at least in my experience is pro-business, they're pro-pharmaceutical company but if this medicine hurts enough people, they'll slap about-- black box warning on it and almost all of our psychiatric medications having. Before imaging, I felt like I always throwing darts in the dark at my patient. And I went into psychiatry because I loved it. I wanted to help people because I realized if I helped you, I'll be helping your children and your grandchildren. So imagine my horror, this person made six out of nine criteria for major depression, I put one on Prozac, they get remarkably better. I put another person on Prozac and now they wanna kill themselves or they wanna kill someone else. It's horrifying or someone meets all the criteria for ADHD. One person get traumatically better on Ritalin another person wants to die. Because those are not one thing in the brain. 

00:10:00
It's Not Working Very Well! Psychiatric Outcomes Have Not Improved in Decades > Insel, NIMH, "The unfortunate reality is that current medications help too few people to get better and very few people to get well." > Antidepressants effect similar to placebo, except for severely depressed > Antipsychotics and stimulants no more effective than in 1954 For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 

00:10:00
DANIEL AMEN You know, our current method is not working very well. Tom Insel whose director of the National Pseudo Mental Health said, "The unfortunate reality is that current medications help too few people to get better and very few people to get well." And I would argue, the problem is not the medications, it's that we're throwing them blindly at patients and assuming things like ADD anxiety depression or single or simple disorders in the brain which they are not. Antidepressants-- you read the res-- the news reports recently? I mean these are based on very large studies. The effect is similar to placebo except for the severely depressed. And, oh, by the way did you know that 23% of women bea-- between the ages of 20 and 50 are taking antidepressants. Antipsychotics and stimulants are no more effective than they were in 1954. We have no more effective antipsychotic medication than Thorazine, 1954 no more effective stimulant than Ritalin 1954. It's interesting that is the era I was born. So, maybe there was something special about that year. 

00:11:20
Not Looking at the Brain Hurts Patients and Families > Symptom based diagnosis are misleading - many ways to depression > Lead to one-size-fits-all treatments - no understanding of illness subtypes > Often completely miss TBI, toxicity or infections - often the primary cause of psychiatric symptoms > Misses that some psychiatric medications are toxic to brain function > Miss a huge opportunity to ↓↓ sigma, ↑↑ compliance > What if Mental Health Was Really Brain Health? 

00:11:20
DANIEL AMEN Not looking at the brain hurts patients and families because we're making symptom based diagnosis which are misleading. It leads to a one-size-fits-all treatment which doesn't work. And because people aren't looking at brain, you miss big things like mild traumatic brain injury, toxicity or infections which I argue are often the primary cause of psychiatric illness. You also miss that some medications like benzos are just flat out toxic to the brain. Take a benzo, go have a drink, you know, go and have a drink, it's cheaper. You know, both are addictive, both will make you stupid, why are spending money on this? And without looking at the brain, do you realize as I graduated from medical school in 1982. We have not decrease stigma or shame in the field of mental health one bet in the last 30 years, that's crazy. But as soon as you saw someone there troubled scan. I saw a woman earlier today her brain is just on fire. She's anxious, depressed, obsessive and just the act of seeing the scan she realizes it's the medical problem not a moral problem. Do you what that's worth clinically? That's really helpful. So I like this little phrase, "What if mental health was really brain health?" What a concept. But if you never look, you can go on and on about the mind and completely forget about the brain. 

00:13:00
Not Looking at the Brain Hurts Society > Organizations like NFL/NHL remained in denial for decades about long term effects of TBI > Military personnel with TBI are often left without appropriate help and hope - 700,000 veterans are incarcerated and suicidal leads the way for premature death > Costly dementias are not diagnosed until late in illness 

00:13:05
DANIEL AMEN By not looking at the brain it hurts our society. Organizations like the NFL like the NHL remains in denial for decades about the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury. Military personnel with TBI are often left without appropriate help or hope. Did you know there are today 700,000 incarcerated veterans. That is the scandal. You get a blast injury, nobody looks at your brain, you come home, you're angry, you do something bad, they throw you in jail, your family divorces you. You are fighting the war when you come home, and that's not fair. Costly dementias are not diagnosed until late in the illness because no one's screening people's brains. You know, when I turn 50 my doctor wanted me to have a colonoscopy. I asked him why he didn't wanna look at my brain. Isn't the other end of my body just as important? 

00:14:10
Ineffectively Treated Brain Problems Are Expensive & Painful! > Underachievement > School failure > Job failure > Relationship problems > Legal problems > Failed therapy attempts > Multiple failed med trials > Residential treatment can cost -$100,000 a year for troubled teens > 28 days drug treatment is - $20-80,000/month > Psychiatric hospital stays often > $2,000 a day > Permanent disability is extremely costly 

00:14:10
DANIEL AMEN So, I know, some of you are going, "Oh, brain scans are so expensive!" But you always have to ask yourself, like when I put a child on medicine for ADD. The parents go, "What are the side effects?" And I understand, and I tell them the side effects, I said but you always have to ask the other question which are, "What are the side effects of not being treated?" So you go what's the cost. You always have to ask yourself the question, well what's the cost of not doing it. And effectively treated brain problems are expensive and painful from underachievement, school failure, job failure, relationship problems, lawyers are expensive, failed therapy. Attempts and if you have a troubled brain and you go to therapy, it's just not innocuous that it didn't work? It's demoralizing that it didn't work because you spent your time and money and you tried and it didn't work, and you tried and it didn't work, and you tried and it didn't work. And Martin Seligman I think is here at the conference of cooing the term learned helplessness. It so applies to our patients in therapy. And you know what therapist don't do. It's like you know, I don't really know what's going on. I'm sorry I, I just don't have enough information. No, we blame the patient. You know, psychiatry has a long history of blaming the patients and what do we call them? Personality disorders. What the hell does that mean? It means you're really screwed up and I'm not likely to get you better and it's not my fault, it's your fault. Come to my session tomorrow with Otto Kernberg on borderline personality disorder. We are going to have a very interesting conversation. Multiple failed medication trials and think residential treatment before you ever said someone to residential treatment. They should get scan up to $100,000 a year of drug treatment or psychiatric hospital stays or $2,000 a day and effectively treated brain problems or disaster for our country. And it's so interesting cuz you know about Sandy Hook and Aurora, ah, Virginia Tech, all the mass schools. You-- did you know almost all of those guys were-- they're taking medication or had been taking medication. 

00:16:40
When people say there's not enough research on SPECT ask, "Are you sure?"

00:16:40
DANIEL AMEN Now, some people are gonna say there's not enough research on SPECT in my work and I just want you to ask them the question, "Are you sure?" So, uhm, so all of you, if you want these slides, you just have to text the number I have on the screen periodically. But let me just me go through some of the research. So there's research on ADHD predicting positive and negative response, Cho in 2007, my work 2008. Ah, Brockmann from Germany showed that with depression if your brain is hypofrontal you'll get better with an SSRI, if its hypofrontal those will actually make you worse. There's research on prediction for TMS, for older people, for OCD, alcoholic relapse, social anxiety, Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia. I just-- people often when they don't know about something, they go, "Oh, there's no research behind it." And I would just argue ignorance is irritated. Oh, he's never published any of these words. Ah, that's just irritating when you have 55 published studies. 

00:17:55
Early Lesson > ADHD > Anxiety > Depression > Addictions > NOT single or simple disorders > All have multiple types For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 

00:17:55
DANIEL AMEN Big lesson early on, really big lesson. Illnesses like ADHD, anxiety, depression, addictions, they're not single or simple disorders in the brain. They all have multiple types. It's not that Ritalin is a bad drug, it's a great drug for the right person. Give it to the wrong brain and it's a disaster. 

00:18:15
Two Patients with Depression Rx needs to be tailored to individual brains Current Clinical DSM Psychiatric Model Symptoms = Diagnosis = Treatment Depression Depression Antidepressants Anxiety Anxiety Disorder Anti-anxiety meds Attention ADHD Stimulants Explodes Intermittently Intermittent Explosive Disorder I.E.D. Anger management ?? meds 

00:18:15
DANIEL AMEN So for example, here are two patients who have depression. One has really low activity in his brain, the other has really high activity. Do you think they'll respond to the same treatment? Of course not. And how would you ever know unless you look. So this is the current way we make psychiatric diagnosis. What's your symptoms, ah, depression. So we'll then give you a diagnosis of the same name, isn't that interesting? You're depressed, your diagnosis and depression we give medicine for depression. Or you're anxious so we give you an anxiety disorder medicine, ah, med-- diagnosis and then an anxiety disorder medication. Or you have attentional problem so you get ADHD and then stimulant, or my favorite one, to help explain this phenomenon, this psychosis that we have in our profession is intermittent explosive disorder. Now, what the hell does that mean? It means you explode intermittently. So you explode intermittently so you get a diagnosis of IED. Anybody see the irony in that? And so then what the hell do you with that? I don't know. Anger management classes and anti-convulsion-- ah, you know, why? What is it me? You look at through the lens of imaging it means it means it probably had a brain injury and they hurt the left and below. But, why not look and find out. 

00:19:50
There Is A Better Way > Comprehensive Clinical Assessment + > Functional Imaging = > More targeted treatment and > Significantly improved patient outcomes How does SPECT Change Clinical Practice? Specific Ways Brain SPECT Imaging Enhances Clinical Psychiatric Practice > SPECT changed diagnosis or treatment 79% > Unexpected brain injuries, toxicity or showed new targets for treatment 

00:19:50
DANIEL AMEN So, I argue there is a better way. Of course you have to talk to people. You can't image somebody and treat them, you have to talk to them and do a really good mental health assessment upon them. And then you add image and that leads to a more targeted diagnosis and specific treatment targeted to their symptoms plus their brand. So we actually publish the study. How does SPECT change clinical practice? We actually found in a consecutive series of a 109 patient where were blinded both to the clinical history initially. So read the scans and then-- got that backwards. Read the history and go okay, based on the history of mental status exam here the diagnosis and here is the treatment. And then we added the scans and we went to seven board certified psychiatrist. How often with change-- what you would do with the patient? It was eight times out of 10 which by the way is the same finding that the University of Washington found when use SPECT in a dementia clinic. 

00:21:00
Multiple, 6-Moth Outcome Study of Complex Psychiatric Patients Evaluated with Addition of Brain SPECT Imaging Better Outcomes > Amen Clinics > 500 consecutive patients > On average our patients have 4.2 diagnoses > Failed 3.3 prior providers and 6 medications > 75% significantly increased across all measures > QOLI significantly increased in 85% > Cleveland Clinic QOLI in <ented this tragedy and others like it? Junior Seau 1969-2012 Junior Seau Dead 50% 

00:21:00
DANIEL AMEN But the real question is, does it improve your outcomes? So everyone who comes to one of our six Amen clinics we put them through a formal outcome study. All of our patients, why? Because we study what we do. And I would argue you should do that in your practice too. You can see what you're really good at and what you need more education or information on. And so our first 500 consecutive patients we found out, we treat complicated people. On average they have 4.2 diagnoses, they failed 3.3 people, professionals and six medications. And at end of six months 75% of them are better across all measures. Back depression inventory briefs symptom inventory quality of life inventory and then we go, are better and were you compliant? Compliant people tend to get better, faster that's not a big surprise. It's-- 85% of them their quality of life went up. We're pretty excited about that. The Cleveland clinic reports its outcome studies like we do, and they said almost 50% of their patients are quality of life went up. Why are we better? Because we add imager. 

00:22:10
Early Lesson > Mild traumatic brain injuries are a major cause of psychiatric illness For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Mild? 

00:22:10
DANIEL AMEN Another really early lesson for us and probably if you go and got me in the corner and you go, okay, single most important lesson you've learned from 85,000 scans. Mild traumatic brain injury ruins people's lives. And nobody knows about it? Why? Because they get depressed, they get temperamental. Uhm, they can't concentrate, they don't sleep, they see mental health people who never ask them about brain injury or maybe the cursor-- you know, in a cursory way we'll ask them once. And so it's completely forgotten. Plus they hate the term mild traumatic brain injury because in fact there is often nothing mild about these brain injuries. This is a 15-year-old boy who when he was 3 years old fell down a flight of stairs. He was unconscious for half an hour. In the emergency room they diagnosed him with a mild traumatic brain injury and then after that he was just a mean kid. And the doctor in the emergency room never said if his behavior change, you should get that and evaluate. I met him at the age of 15 after he'd been thrown out of this third residential treatment program. I looked at his brain and went, he needs a rehabilitation program-- a brain rehabilitation program not more behavior therapy. And when you really begin to understand what this poor child had been through, they're punishing, punishing, taking away privileges. Have not sort of not there, if he's dealing with the computer if its broken or not working right. Yes, he has a personality disorder. What is the organ of personality? It's your brain. Think about that. If your behavior is so bad you can't leave a home and you're in a residential, what difference it make if they call you antisocial personality disorder? Somebody should be going why? The easy answer is to call you bad, the harder answer is why. 

00:24:20
Undiagnosed Brain Injuries Are a Major Cause of: > Homelessness > Drug/alcohol abuse > Depression > Panic attacks > ADHD > Suicide 

00:24:20
DANIEL AMEN Mild traumatic brain injury or undiagnosed brain injuries are a major cause of homeless, did you know that? Fifty-eight percent of the homeless men in Toronto had a significant brain injury before they were homeless. It's a major cause of drug and alcohol abuse. Our medical director Rob Johnson is here. He used to be the Medical Director at Sierra Tucson. He and I did study together and 500 consecutive new admissions to, ah, that hospital that's you know, a wonderful hospital for taking care, ah, addicts. And it's, ah, 44% of the new admissions to their hospital had a significant brain injury before they were hospitalized. Traumatic injuries associated with depression, panic attacks, ADHD and suicide. 

00:25:10
Early Lesson > Infectious disease is a common cause of psychiatric symptoms Adrianna 

00:25:15
DANIEL AMEN Infectious disease is a common cause of psychiatric symptoms. No way! Oh, my goodness! Except on our East Coast clinics and now even on our West Coast clinics we're seeing Lyme disease like crazy. So here is Adrianna. Adrianna when she's 16 years old goes to Yosemite our big National Park here in California. And she is, ah, surrounded by six deer and at the moment on vacation they think it's magical. But 10 days later she become psychotic and full of rage and she ends up in a psychotic hospital and after six antipsychotic medications and Adrianna's shell of her cell, ah, they bring her to our clinic. And when we scan her, her brain looks damaged. It's a very rare scan for a 16-year-old girl and we go why? Scans often don't give you the answer. They just-- did she ask better questions and we're like, well why? So we work her up and what we found out is she was positive for Lyme. And, and on antibiotic she got her life back. She just graduated from high school, finished her first year at Pepperdine. I mean I'm so excited for her but if I treated her as a psychiatric patient without brain information I would have ruined her life. We are responsible for this as a profession because we're not using tools we have actually had for many years. 

00:26:50
More Lessons > Judges and defense attorneys sought our help to understand criminal behavior > > 500 convicted felons, including 90 murderers > Our work taught us that people who do bad things often have troubled brain > Many of these brains could be rehabilitated 

00:26:50
DANIEL AMEN More lessons. Judges and defense attorneys heard about our work and they sought our help to understand criminal behavior. So today, the Amen clinic scan more 500 convicted felons and 90 murderers. Our work taught us that people who do bad things often have troubled brains. Not a big surprise. What did surprise us however, was that many of these brains could be rehabilitated. 

00:27:20
Radical Idea? > What if we evaluated and treated troubled brains? > Rather than simply warehousing them in toxic, stressful environments > In our experience, we could save tremendous $$ by making people more functional > So when they got out of prison they could work, support their families and pay taxes. 

00:27:20
DANIEL AMEN So I have a really radical idea for you. What if we evaluated and treated troubled brains rather than simply warehousing them in toxic, stressful environments. That is not rehabilitation. Stop lying to yourself that it is. You are making works. In our experience we could save tremendous amounts of money by making people more functional. See, this is a very liberal idea that I actually think had its core, is very conservative because what would happen is when they out of prison they can work, support their families and pay taxes. That would be good for our economy. But what we have is this short-term Wall Street mindset of what's the profit like in the next quarter rather than taking the longer view. 

00:28:15
Fyodor Dostoevsky > "A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals." > Instead of just Crime and Punishment > Crime, Evaluation and Treatment For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 Could SPECT have prevented this tragedy and others like it? Junior Seau 1969-2012 Junior Seau Dead 

00:28:15
DANIEL AMEN One of my favorite quotes is from Dostoevsky who said, "A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals." Instead of crime and punishment, what imaging has taught me is we should be thinking about crime evaluation and treatment. More lessons. So when I first started doing imaging we'd see high school players who had brain damage, and then we see college players who had brain damage and then we saw NFL players who had brain damage. And I could just see the NFL was having none of it. They started their Concussion Committee but they really weren't very serious about it. And then rash of tragedies happened including hall of famer Junior Seau. Could imaging have prevented the tragedy because you know how Junior Seau killed himself. There's actually a signature pattern for NFL players to commit suicide. They shoot themselves in the chest so they can donate their brains. 

00:29:25
In 1994 NFL Formed Concussion Committee > Yet, it has never sponsored a functional brain imaging study players > ... instead studied rats > In 2009 Goodell said to Congress, "NFL didn't know if playing football caused long term brain damage. They were still studying the issue." > NFL acted like many employers - delay ... deny ... and blame the employee when they're hurt 

00:29:30
DANIEL AMEN 1994, the NFL formed its Concussion Committee yet by 2009, it had never sponsored a functional brain imaging study, instead literally they studied rats. They put these little tiny helmets on rats and took this 50 and 100-gram pellet and whack in the head repeatedly. And then they'd study their brains and they went, "We don't know. We're studying the issue." And in 2009, Roger Goodell was in front of Congress. Congress was hot on their trail and go, "The NFL didn't know if playing football caused long term brain damage. They were studying the issue." And Maxine Waters, the congresswoman from Los Angeles smacks the commissioner and said, "Commissioner, having you study head trauma and football is a conflict of interest. It sort of like having the tobacco companies study lung cancer." But they were making the appearance as if they were doing it. The NFL acted like many employers, delay, deny, and hope they die. But unfortunately, they were dying in record number. 

00:30:45
Problem with the NFL's Position > If you don't admit you have a problem, you cannot do anything to solve it! > Many brain damaged NFL players were left without help or hope > 2009-2012 Amen Clinics with LA Chapter of NFLPA performed first large functional imaging study on players > Brain SPECT imaging helped to change everything Damage Seen Across Whole Brain 

00:30:45
DANIEL AMEN And the problem with the NFL's position, is if you do not admit that you a problem, you can't do anything to solve the problem. Many brain players were left without help and hope. And so in 2009, my colleagues and I undertook the first and world's largest study on active and retired NFL players. And what we did is we did neuropsych assessments on them plus imaging, imaging in two ways. We did brain SPECT scans and quantitative EEGs. We published the first study in 2011 on a 100 patients in an American psychiatric association journal and the results were devastating compared to a healthy group. They had global decreases in their frontal lobes, judgment, impulse control, organization, planning, aorta. In their temporal lobes, memory, mood stability, temper control and the one that surprise for us was is their cerebellum which is coordination but also thought coordination. No wonder the average lifespan of an NFL career is three and a half years.

Healthy 16 Year Guard Brain Rehab program > Damage so high, we performed a "real-world" rehabilitation study > Brain healthy strategies (diet, exercise, weight loss if needed) > Brain boosting supplements (5.6 grams fish oil, B6, B12, folic acid, gingko, vinpocetine, huperzine A. NAC, carnitine, and alpha lipoic acid) Significant Rehabilitation Possible > 65 players > 80% improvement > Especially in: > Memory 69% > Attention 53% > Mood 40% > Motivation 40% > Sleep 25% 

00:32:05
DANIEL AMEN This, ah, a healthy scan on the left. One of our players on the right whose 42 years old had global decreases in damage across his brain. But, I always go and approach my work not as a researcher, I'm very curious. But I wanna get people well. I spend my days trying to get people well. So is it possible that we could rehabilitate chronically damaged troubled brains? Well, maybe. So what we did because we paid for the study so we had to do it in a cost effective way, we taught them how to take care of their brains. So three things. You want a brain rehabilitation program, it's three things. Brain envy, you gotta teach people to care about their brains. Second thing, avoid anything that hurts it. Marijuana is not going green. I don't care how many times you smoke pot and you tell yourself it's good for your brain, it's not. Brain envy, avoid bad, do good. So we worked on their diets, and exercise, ah, managing the stress in their life. Weight loose you'll hear something in a minute that will horrify you. Uhm, and then we put them on a group of supplements, high dose fish oil, ah, a very smart multiple vitamin, high doses of B6, B12 and folic acid, gingko and vinpocetine, the boost blood flow, some other supplements. And what we found is 80% of our players showed cognitive improvement brain damaged players on a smart program showed cognitive improvement especially in things like memory, attention, mood, motivation, and even sleep. Now we're excited. You are not stuck with the brain you have. We can make it better and we can prove it.

Tight End 12 Years Before After 18 mos 

00:34:00
DANIEL AMEN So here is one of our tight ends, uhm, who had a very damaged brain. And all by the way, he said he never had a concussion. So it's not the big hits because dementia, Joe Louis once said, you know, the famous boxer. He said, "It's not the bog hits that cause the long term problems, it's the thousands of little hits." And, uhm, the guard I told you about earlier. This was 18 months later. Yes, he lost a 110 pounds and took the supplements, but as his brain is better, his life is better. How would you know unless you look? If you didn't look at the player's brains, it's easy to be in denial and then let your child play. "Oh, but your child wants to play." Is that a good idea? "But he wants to play Dr. Amen." I sit in a conference recently in the future of medicine and one of my panelist is a friend of mine. Say I have a 13-year-old and he wants play, what would you say? Golf. But he really wants play, uhm, like Jeff, he really wanted to do cocaine, would that be okay with you? No. The damage is about the same in my experience. 

00:35:20
2011 ... NFL Radically Changed Its Position on TBI None of this was possible without the clinical application of neuroimaging. Reversing Brain Damage Is Exciting New Frontier, But the Implications Are Wider From Failure to Success Before After Ray and Nancy Nancy Before After 10 Weeks Ray and Nancy After 

00:35:20
DANIEL AMEN So in 2011, everything changed. The NFL radically changed its position on traumatic brain injury. They have a concussion poster now in every major NFL locker room and none of this would have been possible without the images. Reversing brain damage is exciting, it's a new frontier but the implications are wider than traumatic brain injury. Here's a 15-year-old ADHD girl who was cutting herself, failing in school, fighting with her parents and on a set of treatments, this was only three days later. Her brain was better and then years later, she's still better. Easy to call her bad. Really hard to call her bad when you look at her troubled brain. Or one of my favorite story is this Ray White and his wife Nancy. Ray is one of our NFL players. He joined the study so I would see his wife who had just been diagnosed with frontal temporal lobe dementia. It was awful. The doctor told Ray that he should find a home for Nancy because within a year she would not know his name. Now, when I scanned her, the scan is very consistent with frontal temporal lobe dementia. And I told him, I said we have nothing, ah, that has been proven to help this. But if this was my wife, I would do everything possible to see if I could activate her frontal lobes, supplements, medication, hyperbaric oxygen, neurofeedback, new learning, stopping sugar and alcohol, put her on a very specific diet. Ten weeks later, no lie this is her brain. And now, we are four years later, and Nancy still knows Ray's name and she's not in a home because we never look, we never know about the possibility of rehabilitation and we let people wither in homes without the appropriate heroic efforts that our cardiologists friends for their patients, or oncologists friends do for their patients. We do not love and respect our patients because we're not doing everything. We can because basically we fly blurt.

Imaging and fighting for your brain goes away beyond mental health issues For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 140 Studies > As weight goes up, physical size and function of the brain go down!! > 70% Americans overweight > Biggest brain drain in US history > Dinosaur Syndrome > What we can do? 

00:37:55
DANIEL AMEN Imaging and fighting for your brain goes way beyond mental health issues. There are now a 140 brain imaging studies that say as your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down, that should scare the fat of anyone. Seventy percent of Americans are overweight, this is the biggest brain drain in the history of the United States. We will never maintain a greatness in our society if we have the dinosaur syndrome. Big body, little tiny brain. You're going to be extinct. So what can we do? So 2010 it's a Sunday morning, I just finished writing my second book on the connection between physical health and mental health. I'm so excited that I finished the book and I looked to my wife Tana and I said, "Come on honey, let's get Chloe, it's our 6-year-old daughter at the time." I said, "Let's go to church." And so, we went off to church and as we got there, I looked to Tana, I said, "Why don't you drop Chloe off the children's church, I'll go save the seats." As I walk toward the sanctuary the very large church in Newport Beach. 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
DANIEL AMEN And I've been going to church since I was 4 years old, and I've always seen the doughnuts but today they horrified me. I was furious. And then right around the corner, from the doughnuts is bacon and sausage cooking on the grill. And I'm like, "Stop it!" And then right before I walked into the sanctuary, they were cooking hundreds of hotdogs for after church and I'm furious. And as I sat down, the minister started talking about the ice cream festival they had the night before. And I feel like I'm crazy, angry, and when my wife found me in church, I'm typing on my phone. And, ah, you know, I don't about your wife but my wife thinks this thing is the other woman, she hates it. You know, and she gives you that look that only your wife can give you like why the hell are you on that thing in church! And so I showed her what I was writing, go to church, get doughnuts, bacon, sausage, hotdogs, ice cream they have no idea this next part is own caps-- they are sending people to have them early. This is not the plan and so, in August of 2010 in that church in Newport Beach, I prayed that God would use me to change the culture of food at church. Now, what a crazy prayer for a psychiatrist who looks at people's brains. I'm like-- and I'm even like, "God please do this." And I'm like, "That's nuts." If you know the Bible belt is widening. The epicenter of the obesity epidemic in the United States happened to be in Bible belt, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, because they feed people terribly. So two weeks after my prayer, Pastor Rick Warren from Saddleback Church called me. Pastor Warren on one Sunday had baptized 850 people. About the 500 person and at Saddleback they put people actually under the water so they baptized you with immersion and so he's literally lifting the weight of America's obesity epidemic. And about 500, he said it's not a very spiritual thought, he's like, "Oh, my God we're all fat!" And I'm fat so I got up in front of his congregation the next week and ask for their forgiveness because he was bad role model. And he said, "Do any of you wanna get healthy with me?" And he said, "Dr. Amen will you help us?" Like, oh, my God. And like you had me from a world. 

00:43:10
THE DANIEL PLAN GOD'S PRESCRIPTION FOR YOUR HEALTH > Church healthcare initiative > 52 week program > Content delivered weekly through web > Meet in small groups > 15,000 people in project > Results are spectacular!! At Saddleback Everything Is Changing > After 12 months church has lost 250,000 lbs. > People report improved energy, focus, creativity, sleep, and mood. > Reduction in stress, blood pressure, blood sugar, sexual dysfunction and many medications!! Going Global 

00:43:15
DANIEL AMEN And so together with my friends, Mark Hyman and Mehmet Oz, we created the Daniel Plan, God's Prescription For Your Health. It's a church-based health care initiative. Initially it's a 52-week program. We delivered content weekly through the web. They meet in small groups, 15,000 people signed up the first week and the results were spectacular. After 12 months, the church lost a quarter of a million pounds. People reported improved energy, focus, creativity, sleep and mood reductions and stress, blood pressure, blood sugar, sexual dysfunction and many medications. So this week, we launch the Daniel Plan internationally. We're very excited. 

00:44:10
[sil.] 

00:44:15
DANIEL AMEN So I would argue that prayer is probably a good thing. It certainly seems to work in my life because you know, it's not just people in churches, we actually have synagogues doing this. We have businesses doing this because you don't want a smaller brain. And as I've been thinking about it, I know McDonalds has gone after our kids. Happy meals that really aren't happy. They try to entice them with clowns. They even give lots of money to charity for children but ultimately it's about illness, coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kraft, General Mills are going after our kids. Well, I think we should go after them too. And we're gonna plant the Daniel Plan in pre-schools and schools and high schools, and you can plant in your practice because it's perfect. It's based on five pillars, faith, why do you care? Food, do you know your brain uses 25% of your calories? The calories you consume. Fitness, you gotta move, it's the fountain of youth. Focus, that's my part, brain health and not believing whatever stupid thought you have. We quite talk about that at this conference. And friends, people get better together. 

00:45:40
God gave you a big brain fro a reason! > Now is the time to look at it! > Optimize it > Take it seriously For slides, TEXT name & email to (949) 220-0891 This war is personal! 

00:45:40
DANIEL AMEN I love this slide. God gave you a big brain for a reason. Now is the time to look at it, to optimize it, to take it seriously. This war for your brain is very personal to me. So, 1991, I start doing scans. I'm so excited, you can tell on the passionate person. I feel like I'm a better doctor so that's the most important thing to me. I have more information to help my patients. 1992, I realized some people don't like the fact that I'm scanning people. And I'm like, seriously? What's your alternative? More of the same? How is that helpful? 1993 I presented and all day lecture at the American Psychiatric Association with my friends from Crane. And now the researchers are like crazy and attacking me and if you knew me personally, I'm terribly shy and I like people to like me. And now, all of a sudden people don't like me and they're mad at me. And so for about two years, I stop talking about our work but we kept doing it. But I'm horrified, you know, people me like a charlatan and a snake oil salesman and then you know, I looked at up, snake oil? Did you know that snake oil has 23% omega 3 fatty acid? I don't know, maybe it's not a bad thing. But I'm telling you, I was anxious and afraid, unhappy, and so excited about our imaging work. 

00:47:30
Andrew 

00:47:30
DANIEL AMEN And then one night. Oh, this picture didn't come out right. Hey, what's the matter with this picture. I have no idea what happened. Let me fix this cuz you have to see him. He is so cute. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:47:55
DANIEL AMEN So this is Andrew. Andrew is 9 and I got a call in April 1995 from my sister-in-law Sherry who told me Andrew, my 9-year-old nephew who's also my godson. So hand her like this, attacked a little girl on the baseball field that day for no particular reason. And I'm like, "Excuse me?" She said, "Danny, he is different. His mean, he doesn't smile anymore. I went into his room today and I saw two pictures that he had drawn. One of them he was hanging from a tree. The other picture he was shooting other children." Andrew was Sandy Hook, Aurora, Columbine waiting to happen. And I'm listening to her and I'm like, "I wanna see him tomorrow." And so at the time I was in Northern California clinic, they drove from Southern California to Northern California. And I was sitting with Andy I said, "Buddy, what's the matter?" He said, "Uncle Danny I don't know. I'm just mad all the time." I said, "Does anybody hurting you?" He said, "No." I said, "Does anybody teasing you?" He said, "No." I said, "Does anybody touching you in places they shouldn't be touching you?" He said, "No." And my first instinct was to scan him. I thought he had a left temporal lobe problem. We already had associated left temporal lobe problems with violence. But the other part of my head went-- you wanna scan everybody. I have good psychoanalytic training, you know, maybe this is really a psychodynamic issue and then I'm like he's the second son and a Lebanese family, I'm the second son in a Lebanese family. And then my brain went, stop it. Scan him. If his brain is fine then you can play that game. And so I went with him to the imaging center and held his hand while he held his teddy bear and got scanned. This is the image that came up on the screen. He was in fact missing is left temporal lobe. I'd actually never seen that. I've seen it 43 time since. He has a cyst the size of the golf ball occupying the space of his left temporal lobe. And I'm like sad but sort of glad. We had a reason for his behavior, take is out. Drain it. Do something with it. Get rid them. And so I called his pediatrician here in Southern California. And he said okay I'm on it. And he called three neurologist all of them said they didn't think-- they didn't think at anything correlated to his behavior and they wouldn't touch it until he had real symptoms. And I'm like, "What?" He said, "Yeah, I thought that was odd." I'm like, "What do you think real symptoms mean?" "Oh, like until he has seizures or he losses consciousness, or he has speech problems." I'm like, "Are they like out of their mind?" And then I called a friend of mine at Harvard who is a pediatric neurologist. She told me the same thing and I'll bet you, today she's still hears me screaming at her. Say not nice things that I can't say when I go to Saddleback church. I am livid and then I think to myself, neurologist, neurologist, neurologist, neurosurgeons, neurosurgeons do thinks. So I called the pediatric neurosurgery department of UCLA. And I speak to Jorge Lazareff who you'll know who he is. He's the neurosurgeon that separated the Guatemalan twins at the head, remember that? Well, he was famous to me beforehand because I when I told him about Andrew. He said, "Dr. Amen, when the cyst or symptomatic and obviously Andrew is symptomatic we drain them." And so after the surgery I got two calls. One of them from Sherry, Andrew's mother who said the surgery went really well. And she said, "Danny, when he woke up from surgery he smiled at me." She said, "He hadn't smiled for a year." And then I got a call from Dr. Lazareff who said, "Oh, my God Dr. Amen I'm so glad to sent us Andrew because that cyst was so aggressive. It had put so much pressure on his brain that it actually thin the bone over his left temporal lobe. If he would have been hit in the head with the basketball it would have killed him instantly. Either way, he would have been dead in six months." And his behavior completely went back to normal. Easy to call him bad, a little harder to go why? A year later, Andrew and I are in Hawaii and we're on vacation together and we spent a day and we were snorkeling and we had a great time. He's got this big beautiful brown curls and afterwards we went and got a drink together and he looked at me with his penetrating brown eyes and he said, "Uncle Danny, why did that happened to me?" Because we have a spiritual family that believes things happen for a reason that we're not just here by random chance. And I started to cry and I said, oh, my God. I knew why it happened because the moment of his surgery I didn't care what you say about me. You have to start scanning people's brains otherwise how the hell do you know what's going on in people's brains unless you look and it's not fair to call people personality disorders when in fact they have brain dysfunction. It's wrong to do that. So here he is. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:30
DANIEL AMEN So Andrew-- so now were 18 years later. And he is 27 and he's employed. And he owns his own home and he's a good son. What do you think would happen to him if somebody wouldn't have bothered to look? And how many people do weeps a row away? Like Adrianna who had Lyme disease or the 15-year-old boy who fell down a flight of stairs, residential treatment, more meds, more psychiatrist, more punishment. I don't know, I'm not happy about this. We're in a war. We're in a war for the health of our profession which continues to be ridiculed. You know 1980, 1980 I decided I wanted to be a psychiatrist. I fell in love with it. And you know what my dad said? "Why don't you wanna be a real doctor?" And 30 years later, I understand why he said that. We have to act like the brain is our organ, but you have to look at it. 

00:55:50
By Not Using Functional Imaging Routinely in Clinical Practice > We hurt patients and their families > We hurt our society > We diminish our profession > We forget about the brain > We CAN DO better. > Please join me in creating an imaging revolution! 

00:55:50
DANIEL AMEN By not using functional imaging routinely in clinical practice we hurt patients. We hurt their families. We hurt our society. We diminish our profession. We forget about the brain and we can do better. Please join me in creating a brain health and imagining revolution. Thank you so much.

00:56:35
DANIEL AMEN So I think I'm, ah,-- ended a little early. We have time for maybe three questions. 

00:56:40
 Can you tell SPECT-- floor. I'm not enough to the mike enough-- can you redefine what SPECT stands for? 

00:56:50
DANIEL AMEN SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography. It's a nuclear medicine study that looks at blood flow. Some people go, how does it compare to PET? They're cousins of each other. PET looks at glucose metabolism, SPECT looks at blood flow. SPECT is cheaper, easier to do and we have an 85,000 scanned database to compare it to. Yes. 

00:57:15
 Does insurance pay for it? 

00:57:15
DANIEL AMEN Sometimes. 

00:57:20
 Sometimes. 

00:57:20
 How do we advocate with insurance companies to change that so that it becomes a standard of care? 

00:57:25
DANIEL AMEN You know, insurance companies will change it when our field starts to demand that we need more information to help our patients. Uhm, so the question about what does it cost to have a scan? Scans are about $1,200 of full evaluation when a bar clinics is about $3,500 which involves two, two scans in, ah, a very detailed evaluation. Yes, sir. 

00:57:50
 I have a question. I have a se-- ah, 17-year-old so who is autistic living in a treatment center could not travel to any of your centers. But if you had a brain scan where he is could that material be used for shall I say a treatment? 

00:58:05
DANIEL AMEN Where is he at? 

00:58:05
 Wichita, Kansas. 

00:58:10
DANIEL AMEN You know, I don't know any centers near Kansas. There's one in Chicago but, ah, the hope is more and more people will do it. There's about 30 of us around North America who do this. Ah, I think Chicago is the of course... 

00:58:20
 You have five centers but there's 30 places that do SPECT? Is that what you're saying? 

00:58:25
DANIEL AMEN Yeah, yes. There are many other people that do SPECT besides us, Vancouver, Toronto, Chicago, places in Florida. 

00:58:30
 Just brain imaging, brain imaging won't be the trick. You have to have SPECT? 

00:58:35
DANIEL AMEN Yeah, you know, I'd only want him to get it done if it was done by somebody who knew what they were doing otherwise it wouldn't be helpful. 

00:58:40
 Okay, thank you. 

00:58:45
DANIEL AMEN Yes, sir. 

00:58:45
 Yeah, you presented a, a very good, ah, argument for imaging and, ah, is there a place, ah, how you can see a psychiatry-- is there, ah, equal place for personality disorders or is it either or is there a way that they can work together? 

00:59:00
DANIEL AMEN Well, you know, if I had more time. What I would say is we always do biopsychosocial spiritual evaluations on our patients and I actually thought imaging initially would lead me to do more medication. In fact, it's lead me to do less medication that I publish a study on EMDR and mediation. How they actually help balance, brain function, and with the Daniel Plan we clearly prove people get better together that there is a social and a spiritual aspect. I think personality disorder is maybe one way to help explain you know, the cluster, the symptom cluster. But without the underlying physiology, if you don't marry them, you end up blaming people. And I'm just not sure that's a smart thing to do. Or I'm, I'm-- I, I just don't think that's probably the right thing to do. 

00:59:55
 Hi, Dr. Amen, a huge fan. Uhm, I see a lot of kids in my practice who have gluten sensitivities and do well when I take them off gluten. Are you able to see that on the spot I mean the... 

01:00:00
DANIEL AMEN You know, interesting. There is a published SPECT study where people who are gluten sensitive put them on gluten what it does is it crashes their brain. They get lower overall blood flow to the brain which is very consistent with the brain thought. The biggest testimonials, we get at the Amen clinics happens to be from our corporate nutritionist when she puts people on elimination diets they loose a lot of psychiatric symptoms. 

01:00:25
 Could you just talk a little bit about, uhm, your findings with, as-- Asperger's and the brain and... 

01:00:35
DANIEL AMEN So we've done probably over a thousand, ah, autistic spectrum disorder kids and adults. Uhm, it's not one thing. The classic pattern is they're hypofrontal so where (inaudible ) and flexible things don't go their way. They get upset and they have smaller cerebellums so they don't process information quickly. But about 25% of our autistic patients their brains usually toxic like they had some sort of toxic exposure. Ah, 25% look like brain injury was involved perhaps early in their life. Some of their brains are overactive, some of them are underactive. And without a scan, and you do-- oh, we're gonna behavior therapy for all of them. I just think that's nuts that you, you need a road map on what to do for them. Yes. 

01:01:20
 Uhm, thank you. Same question but with sensory processing disorder cuz I see a lot of children in my practice for that... 

01:01:30
DANIEL AMEN So what we typically see with sensory processing disorders is the back half of their brain works too hard. So you typically you'll see it in their parietal and occipital lobes. Ah, one thing to really pay attention to is something called the Irlen Syndrome, I-R-L-E-N which is visual processing disorder where they are sensitive to certain colors of the light spectrum. I tell you, when I first heard at el-- Helen Irlen speak, ah, we started screaming everybody for it. Okay, one more question then we have to stop. 

01:02:00
 Ah, have you applied any of this to neuro, ah, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and if so, what type of success have you had with that? 

01:02:05
DANIEL AMEN You know, actually, ah, we have, ah, applied to Alzheimer's disease and frontal temporal lobe dementia. We have not yet with Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease. All right, thank you everybody.
