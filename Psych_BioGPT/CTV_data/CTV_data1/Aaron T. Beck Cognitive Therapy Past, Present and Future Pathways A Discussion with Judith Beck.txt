The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA Aaron Beck, MD Biography: Aaron Beck, MD, a professor emeritus in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. He is widely regarded as the father of cognitive therapy, and his pioneering theories are widely used in the treatment of clinical depression. Beck also developed self-report measures of depression and anxiety including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Youth Inventories. He is the President Emeritus of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy and the Honorary President of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, which certifies qualified cognitive therapists. 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
 Ah, I won't even begin to trouble because I can see that we have, uhm, Dr. Beck now on screen and that we'll be able to project him. Let's, ah, put that on screen. 

00:00:15
[sil.] 

00:00:25
 And, ah, an incredible moment because Dr. Beck's landmark article thinking and depression that appeared exactly 50 years ago. We'll visit incredible career, what an impact on our field. So Judith Beck, may I invite you to come up and take over from here. 

00:00:50
JUDITH BECK Thank you. 

00:00:55
AARON BECK Okay, then turn it off. 

00:01:00
JUDITH BECK Ah, so I'm so please to be here today and my dad is so please that he's able to Skype in the wonders of technology. By the way, that article that he published 50 years ago today, uhm, publisher gave us, uhm, permission to reprint that article and so, if you'd like a copy please just e-mail us at the Beck Institute, info@beckinstitute.org and we'll send it to you. It's really astounding. Meanwhile, dad, can you hear me? 

00:01:30
AARON BECK Yeah, I hear you good. 

00:01:30
JUDITH BECK Wonderful. So I just wanted to, ah, introduce my dad a little bit. Well, maybe I'll just start with myself if that's okay. I am the president of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia. We are a nonprofit organization and as part of our mission, we do national and international in cognitive therapy and I'm also a clinical associate professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. My dad, Aaron T. Beck, MD, is an emeritus university professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, ah, and he also is our emeritus president at the Beck Institute where he comes 16 times a year to participate in training, does question and answers, and role plays, and things like that. I wanted to tell you that he is 92. He would never know it. 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:35
JUDITH BECK He has four children, nine grandchildren, one which-- one of whom has followed us into the field of cognitive therapy and he has five great grand children. He still works all of the time. His other hatch is, uhm, with his research team at Penn where they are researching in many different areas including the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, ah, teaching community mental health centered counselor to do cognitive behavior therapy and also suicidality. And I realized that I could continue to introduce him for at least the next hour but then we've never get to any questions so I thought I would just start and I think you have some opening remarks to make. 

00:03:20
AARON BECK Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm delighted to be here and I wanna thank your side for having originated this whole series of meetings, conferences back-- starting back in 1985. As I recall the first 1985 meeting, all of the major celebrities of the time were present and at that time, one of friend is Dan Goldman who's going around interviewing various people so I asked him, uhm, "How come your not interviewing me?" "Is that all? You feel bad. You know, I'm not interviewing you," and I said, "Why?" "So, it's because I'm getting material for the obituaries of various people who were present." So unfortunately, Dan has, has not come to anymore of his meetings. 

00:04:20
JUDITH BECK That's great. 

00:04:20
AARON BECK Uhm, in any event, uhm, I'm glad to go on and answer any of your question to Judith. 

00:04:25
JUDITH BECK And you know, and if-- uhm, if you could sit up a little bit more I think we can see you a little bit better. Oh, that's yeah. That's, that's great. Ah, so I, you know, I think people in the audience may not realize that you started out as psychoanalyst and really broke from the orthodoxy of the day. Can you tell us a little bit about how you came upon to develop cognitive therapy. 

00:04:55
AARON BECK Well, there actually with two mainstreams in development of cognitive therapy. One which from the research direction, the other was strictly clinical. You know, the clinical is a little bit more dramatic in a way. The, uhm, I was doing formal psychoanalysis for quite a while and one time I was interviewing a woman who spent a time regaling me with her various sexual episodes and so at the end of one particulate session, I asked how she felt and she said, "Well, I feel anxious." And I said, "Well, that make sense because you see all of you sexual impulses have been breaking through the repressive area and when that happens that triggers anxiety." And then she said, "How's that sound? Sure, yes, doctor, I bet I'm just right." But then I notice there was a hesitation in her voice and I said, "You think to hesitate, was there anything? We're leaving out." And she said, "Well, to tell you the truth, doctor. Throughout the whole session, in every session, I get this thought that I'm boring, you know? And I said, "Oh, my goodness. You know, you supposed to tell me everything that goes through your mind. How does that happened?" She said, "Well, it never occurred to me to mention that to you." And, ah, just parenthetically, she hadn't been boring me at all but, ah, ah, so I then started asking some of the other patients that I saw and I realized that they're all having that I called automatic thought which with communication that they made to themselves this, this was an internal communication system, not the kind of system that is usually expose till the outside as things that people say to themselves and it often happens automatically when you're driving the car, you, you may be carrying on a conversation with somebody else but in the meantime, you having this subliminal thoughts, there's a, ah, a red light ahead and maybe if I speed up I can go through it and things like that. Uhm, so that the internal communication system has it turned out with much, much closer to what people would feeling and behaving than their conscious thoughts where-- now, these thoughts were not unconscious. They simply would below the surface and they were quite accessible. I then found that many of these thoughts not all of them, but many of these thoughts, particularly those that were connected with emotion, ah, or actually just thought it, they were not reasonable representation of reality but there often very arbitrary and I made I list actually of the type of cognitive distortions that were and there where such things as arbitrary inference over generalization, personalization, ah, analogical reasoning, and so on. Uhm, and, ah, so at that point I changed this and I thought I could get it, the automatic thought is much better. If I have deserve the patients then I could see what their facial expressions were and that, why I could plumb the depths of the automatic thought. And so I started asking questions which is what is the evidence for the-- for your belief that you're no good, that nobody likes you, that your wife is gonna leave you, you're a bad parent, and so on. And they would then give me specific incidents that happened and when we examined the incidents, it has where, ah, alternative explanations and, ah, following the evidence and following the logic. They often--- they would generally realize through the application of these techniques the their thinking had been incorrect and then, interestingly, as their thinking change to a more correct level, not necessarily, overly positive and we're just more in keeping this reality then they started to feel better and they started to feel better quite rapidly. In those days, ah, the treatment seem to be far more effective probably because of the type of patients we were seeing. So after 10 or 12 visits, the typical patient would say, "Well, doctor, you've helped me. Oh, I-- but this is goodbye time. Bye, bye, and thank you and that's it." So while, I had unable to carry of both time practice, sometimes going on for a year or two years and so on, my practice shrank and pretty soon I had very few patients left. And at that time, the, uhm, head of psychiatry said, "Tim, you're not seeming to make it in private practice so why don't you come aboard and you can teach a residency a new fangotherapy and you can do some good stuff in our research." And so that kind ended my time with, ah, with private practice although I did continue to see patients but under the university ages so that was the beginning. 

00:10:20
JUDITH BECK So the next question is, how do you apply the theory of cognitive therapy? 

00:10:30
AARON BECK Well, the kind have started cognitive therapy technique is basically restructuring, trying to identify specific incidence that would the troubling to the patients, at least for 23 incidents that occurred during the past week not necessarily-- and back like to childhood, staying what the patients interpretations where, and then training the patients on this field of what can get the evidence to see whether their interpretations were correct. Now when is depress, it's like they have a blue prison in front of their eyes and they see everything negatively so there's going to be a profound negative bias and the therapy that is directed through which changing the bias into let's say a more realistic field and that's the way it works and no matter what therapy technique is used, if it changes the information processing. The change is the information processing from distorted to adaptive, then it's consistent with the cognitive model. So since the early days when cognitive restructuring, explicit cognitive restructuring was our main technique, there have been a lot of other strategies that have come to the floor which we can use in various circumstances. This has been very useful because not everybody response to the old, to, let's say, to the standard, ah, cognitive technique. And so when many cases is important to be able to shift courses and use some of the new amount that set up come to the floor. 

00:12:15
JUDITH BECK We-- I wonder if you'd say, ah, a few words about what's some of these other methods are. 

00:12:25
AARON BECK Yes, so that there are number of, there are number of strategies that fall onto the umbrella of third wave treatment. Now, actually, in the history of psychotherapy, we started off with, ah, with, ah, Freud in psychoanalysis and then-- and Watson's behaviorism which then evolved into behavior therapy and then that was the humanist revolution which was spearheaded, ah, by Carl Rogers, who fortunately still has a great deal of influence today. And, uhm, next came cognitivism which focus on information processing and then, finally, there's the so called third wave which I think is a returned to the humanist tra-- tradition. The emphasis is much stronger on humanistic aspects of the human personality and so there's a greater emphasis on such things as values, validation of feelings, uhm, working your people's goals, and so on. And, ah, this has been really incorporated into our own armamentarium and in particular, the latest, ah, work that we've done in this area we can do the therapy, I would say value based and, ah, humanistic is the work we have been during with withdrawn schizophrenic. These are patients who have given up totally on the outside world and build a kind of cocoon around themselves which consist lives lived negative attitudes such as there's no sense in trying, I won't succeed, and, uhm, ah, if I try to attempt to start a relationship, it's only gonna fail. And so they have this profoundly negative outlook on the world and our approach has been to try to restore them to a far more adaptive way of living to try get them to the point where they can get integrated into the community and this takes a lot of expertise and a lot of, ah, understanding. I'm just how the director-- how to direct the, ah, patient in a very cooperative relationship so the engagement becomes very important and then what we do is we take walks with the patients, go to a coffee house, play for the old games but in the context of the engagement that we're doing, we're also-- we're tying to teach them new things and open their minds to new experiences and in a very subtle way, we, ah, try to set goals or work with to set goals for themselves and they look ahead to long range goals. And, ah, even though we think the long range goals are often grandiose, we cans start with minimal here and now goals and then help the patient to get there. So to give you an example, a patient that I saw told me, ah, ah, I, I asked them about himself and he said, "I am president of the United States." And I said, "What did you expect before you became president, uhm, thought you became president?" And, ah, he said, "Well, I thought I would be powerful. I would be able to connect with people. I would get respect. I would have dignity and, ah, people would look up to me." And I said, "And how do you feel now?" He says, "Right now, I feel disrespected. I feel nobody cares for me. I feel hopeless and, uhm, I feel as the way I've no purpose." So this was quite a change from being president so we then seized on these things and said, "So in the immediate future, what are some of the things you could do to make yourself more acceptive with people?" And he said, "Well, I guess I could try starting a conversation with somebody." And so we said as an immediate goal that you'd go around and ask various people questions and try to connect up in that way. So this was a kind of a boning wax starting at a very elementary level and we gradually work him up to the point where he was, ah, ah, able to go to rehab and finally, got him to the point where he could do, thanks for other people and he would then gain all of the things that he was looking for which was respect and throw over some life and the sense of well being. So, anyhow, that's been our own native contribution, you know, to era of the common humanistic tradition. 

00:17:35
JUDITH BECK And interestingly, I know that while your focusing on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, you found that the positive symptoms actually improve as well. 

00:17:45
AARON BECK That's correct so we then started a study with Paul Grant in which we used what we call recovery oriented cognitive therapy. And, uhm, while we do not explicitly focused on delusions to hallucination, ah, we did find that the patient's quality of life, well being and functioning improves significantly as compared to a control group over the period of therapy but what was interesting are two things, one was that the delusions and hallucinations improves substantially and they were now long of getting in the way of the patients functioning and sectionally, if they're thinking the neurocognitive, ah, impairments improved so that their memory executive function and reasoning ability also improved. Well, I-- again, I'm making an explicit, ah, ah, thinking that direction so what this show is that we were actually, ah, building on the patients strengths which is something that Christine Padesky start a great deal about by building up on the patients strengths keeping them a lot of mastery experiencing, showing that they can get pleasure out of life. They started to get more engage with reality and when they got engage with reality, they disengage from the unreality. 

00:19:15
JUDITH BECK I wonder if you could address on another topic, if you could address a couple of misconceptions about cognitive therapy. Uhm, I think that there are number of people who believe that cognitive therapy as practice today is practice in exactly the same way as the first treatment manual that you published, Cognitive Therapy for Depression but that was in 1977 and I wonder if you, if you could address two specific areas. Uhm, one is that some people believe that cognitive therapy is really just, uhm, using a certain set of techniques with clients and they don't recognize the importance of conceptualizing the individual client and they may not recognize that having a very strong therapeutic alliance is an essential part of cognitive therapy. 

00:20:15
AARON BECK Right. Well, there has been misconception. I, I imagine that happens with every school of psychotherapy and there are misconceptions and then they get solidified over time. Actually, the, ah, 1977 manual which was made into a book was actually very flexible and it's, it's not site that you have to do the therapy in large step. It has various chapters that serve as a guide to the therapy. Nonetheless as you are pointing out the, ah, 1980 book did limit the number of therapeutic, ah, techniques that we were using and there was of the emphasis, ah, on what I've been calling the humanistic approaches. I now and, and more recent years, we've been using the more humanistic approaches as I mention in terms of schizophrenia but we've also been doing these in terms of, ah, patients with depression this day. So, ah, a physician who I'm talked a while ago was depressed and he wasn't responding well to the studied techniques and so I shifted the emphasis and I asked him just how he felt about what he was doing and what his goals and aspirations were and he said he was getting very bored with just seeing patients all of the time and I asked him what was behind this and he says, "Well, the university where I teach, ah, everything is based on a number of patient you see and he's just right the mail and you're in assembly line and you see one patient after another." And he said he got very bored just seeing one patient after another and, ah, he didn't see any value and, and except for making money. So I then asked him, I said, "When you first went into medicine what was your motive with going to medicine." He said, "Well, I really wanted to help people." And I said, "Was there anything else?" And I said-- he said, "Yeah," it gave him a sense of, sense of control, sense of mastery to, to be to do this. I then suggested to him the following that he should focus on each patient and then asked himself after he had seen a patient for whatever it was that he manage to himself, to asked himself that he think he was helping the patient, that he feel good about helping the patient and that he got a feeling of mastery. Well, he did this for one week and all of a sudden lo and behold, his whole orientation change. He now got back to his original value which was helping patients and to his own particular goal which was to be in charge, to be able to do things for other people. And so, so that was one example of how we could use a very a focus way of, ah, ah, of, of applying the humanistic technique and, ah, using it in a very focus way so he's gonna directly help the patient. 

00:23:40
JUDITH BECK What, uhm, how-- what are the applications of cognitive therapy to medically related conditions? 

00:23:50
AARON BECK Yes, so what I wanted to do is to go back to the, to Lewis theory. As you know the theory was basically an information processing theory and, ah, had to do with the evaluation of events and, uhm, and then the how-- that's get misinterpreted and just do it and then, lead to maladapted behavior. Ah, and more recent times, I become aware the fact of how much attentional focus plays a big role in all of this not only in, ah, medically related conditions but also in, in standard emotional, ah, problems. So, in the, uhm, ah, there's been a large amount of research that's been done on the so-called psychosomatic disorders or medically related disorders and it turns out that they show that people with hypochondriasis or lower back pain, or a chronic fatigues syndrome show that the same kind of distorted thinking that, uhm, patients with depression and anxiety have but they're belief-- there such a believes are all unique to the particular transition that they have. So the, ah, patient with lower back pain thinks as beliefs like the pain is uncontrollable. He's going to lash it on forever and I've never gonna be able to get me enjoyment of a life and I won't be able to fulfill my obligation as a parent, a spouse, or as a worker, and that therefore, I am nothing. I'm totally useless and so there are various dreads one can pick up there. One of the methods that we use is similar to what I've already describe and that's to get the patient to think of other things in life that are important so it's not only correcting the, ah, the started beliefs and it just started thinking but it's reorienting them to other things in life. Now this is the interesting point, when they focus their attention on things other than their own illness. Let's say focus on the family as they focus on work that they can do for others if they focus on reading, eating, or watching television, it then reduces the pain so it somewhat similar into the schizophrenic patients who find that their delusions, hallucinations diminish as they get more involve in life. Now, in chronic fatigue syndrome, the beliefs is somewhat similar and this particular case is very safe. My fatigue is so great that I can possibly do anything and one of the, ah, one of the collaborative enterprises system have them test out what they can do and if often turns out that of course their fatigue diminishes and they get more energy. Ah, and so, ah, in the hypochondriacal patients, I have a belief that I have to keep going to a doctor in having test whenever I get some kind of unpleasant sensation and in there, ah, the, the method we have to use more of the response prevention which is to try to get them to stop looking for reassurance but again, it's important to redirect them to something outside to themselves. So the major problems whether its depression or anxiety or one of these somatically related diseases is the self focus and anything that you can do to dislodge from the self focus will make them feel better. 

00:27:50
JUDITH BECK What are, ah, some of the biological contributions to our understanding of cognitive therapy? 

00:28:00
AARON BECK Well, I wrote that paper. Ah, well, let's go back in time. As you know, I've always been intrigued by depressions and it seems to violate all of the canons of human nature and, uhm, the first clue that I got, ah, regarding the nature with depression was the study I did back in 1961 on-- of severely depressed patients and turned out that about half of this early depress patients had loss the parent and childhood and in fact, they were often shock that's up until the age eight or nine. This could be a difficult study to do today because the longevity is so much greater, uhm, in any of, ah, one charity-- longevity of parents is much greater. In any of that it became very clear that was of a parent features both somebody to depression and that if they had some other kind of separation experience, ah, they would then experience depression but that as with the question not everybody who's lost of parents becomes depress and, uhm, had to wait until probably, throughout the year 2000 to get the asset to the question, why did some often gets depress way to get on in life and others don't. And, and the 1900-- and the 2000 rather, 2001, 2002 a group of geneticist, discovered first that people who had a particular variant of the serotonin transporter genes so called short-long, ah, were more prone to depression than others who had the stand at far and this was also true upon the genes. So also we shown that a variant that the interaction of person with the gene variant with inimical experiences such as loss of a parent but mostly would be, ah, ah, child abuse. Well, at once, it would become prone to depression. So that was one components of where biology is actually clarified, ah, ah, the onset of, of a disorder. Another, ah, valuable contribution, ah, as then the, ah, and to some of the percep-- perceptual studies that have been done. So that people with the short term or the short-long or the serotonin gene tend to say things out of, you know, works tend to be hypersensitive to negative stimuli even when they're little children and if they then get an abuse or perhaps some other kind of adverse circumstance, the negative receptions then turn into negative attitudes and then, and so negative attitudes which are the stepping stone to depression. So the more proximal course of depression are the dysfunctional attitudes that people develop as a result of negative perceptions which are the result of the ah, of the variants in the genes and another line of experience, ah, line of investigation has to deal with looking in the, ah, looking at responsiveness of people to cognitive therapy depending upon the genotype and there's some evidence now that people with particularly genotype of all likely to breath-- to respond so the standard type of cognitive therapy where others are not and so this then takes us back to the earlier question when do you use just to standard therapy and when are you going to use some of the other techniques, some of the other approaches which can then, then affect those people who have the other with genotype and then, finally, which is not too surprising has been shown that a successful cognitive therapy save of the depression or anxiety, or OCD are accompany by brain changes that make sense. 

00:32:40
JUDITH BECK It's really fascinating that how a neurobiology is informing our practice or should inform our practice. I have another question for you. Ah, the-- we know the research shows that most mental health professionals use at least some cognitive techniques in their work. Can you talk a little bit about how we establish, ah, whether a therapist are confident in cognitive therapy and maybe what therapist might be able to do to increase their confidence? 

00:33:10
AARON BECK Yeah, well, first of all what we see in therapist of any field, we see therapist, ah, who are, ah, what I would call, ah, ah... 

00:33:30
JUDITH BECK Eclectic. 

00:33:35
AARON BECK Well, yeah. You get some who, who are eclectic and there's a kind of blind eclecticism with the, ah, with the therapist would just jump from one technique to another so most of the technique jumpers and this can also happen on people who are labeled cognitive therapist. Then, there are other therapist who will stick to one technique whether it works or not and just stick the technique to death. The way we, you know, evaluate whether people are doing good cognitive therapy is through watching video tapes of sessions or at listening to audio tape and for the last 45 years, we have been using a cognitive therapy rating scale which the nonspecific fact is such as empathy, walks, and understanding but also the specific therapeutic techniques that the people are using to determine whether the techniques are used properly as far as techniques are concern and also properly used for as the timing is concern. So the timing of course is very important and I, I should say at this point, we found that not every person who goes into psychotherapy is really equipped to, to be a good psychotherapist and we do find that some just don't have it. Just like not everybody can be a surgeon, not everybody can be a good psychotherapist. 

00:35:20
JUDITH BECK Ah, what do you, let's see, you know, I wanted to ask you for the end about the future of cognitive therapy. I thought if, if it was okay, we might take a couple of questions from the audience. 

00:35:30
AARON BECK Sure, let's do that. 

00:35:35
JUDITH BECK So if you like to-- do we have microphones set up. 

00:35:40
 Twelve. 

00:35:40
AARON BECK Twelve minutes left. We have 12 minutes left, did you know? 

00:35:40
JUDITH BECK Well, yeah, we, we actually have a little bit longer than that if that's okay with you. Uhm, Dr. Zeig that we would-- could take the full hour so by my clock we have a little bit more than 20 minutes left. 

00:35:55
AARON BECK Oh, okay. So let's take a question. 

00:36:00
JUDITH BECK Oh, the microphones is where are the red flags are and see we have ques-- we have a question right here, thank you. 

00:36:05
 Uhm, pro-- Professor Beck, can I-- you, you were saying that brain changes can determine the type of therapy that, that we might do, uhm, do-- what was a brain changes are you talking about. Do you mean like the activity level and, ah, oxygen flow and what type of, uhm, how do they indicated to us? What type of therapy we, we can be doing from, from those activities? Thank you. 

00:36:35
AARON BECK Well, actually, I'm not in authority on that. I just know what I've, I've read and but I could say this that the type of patients who has done well to cognitive therapy have a high degree of connectivity between the prefrontal lobes and the amygdala, ah, and so they do what I'll, ah, a patients who don't have that, they don't do well in standard cognitive therapy but, ah, in my opinion, they can do well if one put a greater emphasis on engagement and the engagement then itself becomes really important. Ah, and, o-- okay, and I think the rest of it we just have to leave to the future because it's still on a centricity. 

00:37:30
JUDITH BECK Right. See, we have another question. 

00:37:35
 Uhm, Judith, I heard you mention earlier that some of the research Dr. Beck is working on is how to teach therapist to work in a community mental health agencies to practice cognitive behavioral therapy and I work in a community mental health agencies so I'm curious to know a little bit about this research that that's going on right now and sort to what motivated in where you feel like it's, it's moving toward. 

00:38:00
AARON BECK Well, we've been working in the community both within hospitals and with community therapist. The, the research in the, in the community, ah, is not as solid as in the hospital so I can mention that first. So we've worked in a, in a short term and long term city hospital. Ah, by working, I mean we've been training therapist there. We've also train therapist, ah, in two state hospitals but any how the bottom line is this, when we trained the entire staff in what we call recovery oriented cognitive therapy, we emphasize as well I was mentioning before, we found that, uhm, the number of patients who, ah, require a sedation or put in restraints dramatically improves over time. So it can go from let's say in a three months period of 100 patients require and restraints in a given month to maybe one patient requiring restraints. Ah, also we have found that the duration of stay in the long-term hospital has been cut in half and one of the hospitals over a year period. It was cut down from, ah, well, over-- the length of the stay was cut down over a period of time from, ah, 500 days to 220 days and still improving as, as were improving. Now, the situation in the community has been that we've been training, ah, therapist up to a good level of confidence in most cases, however that's very expensive to be doing the, ah, (inaudible ) all of the time and so we now have developed a, a new web base training program for therapist which is really very aware of it and we're going to test that out against the audiotape reviews to see just to what degree we can train patients up to a reasonable level efficacy using the web based training. 

00:40:25
JUDITH BECK We have another question. 

00:40:30
 Ah, Dr. Beck, when I-- Dr. Beck, when I saw you at previous conferences do-- demonstrations and, and I wouldn't have know that you are a cognitive behavior therapist, I was often thinking, he's, at the same time, a good systemic therapist. He's at the same time doing good hypnosis. He's at the same time doing good solutions focus therapy and I had impression that you were doing all the models at the same time while using as model to cognitive behavior. Now, from that one comes my question towards the future of a therapy because I think cognitive behavior therapy is probably the best research therapy what is most evidence in most, ah, research now but to what extent do you think that therapy is in the future will merge towards one, one big form of therapy where different therapies will, will become like one central concept or to what extent do you think that schools will remain like different schools? 

00:41:35
AARON BECK Well, as a superb question, well, thank you. So what I see in the future is that there's gonna be one psychotherapy. I personally believe that the theory or the model, ah, is going to be an extension or expansion of cognitive therapy. Up until now the theory of cognitive therapy behind it has been a permeable membrane so that, ah, as the works is done and whether it's genetic sort of, of various forms of psychology, or sociology, or democracy as new relevant finding come in that are going to catch some kind of light on cognitive processing. Ah, I think that the, ah, the theory is selfish going to expand. Ah, upon the theory what we have been able to do is to formulate specific paradigms or specific formulations for each of the, ah, for each of the, ah, for each of the conditions whether it's something that is, is to-- depress after a heart attack or has cancer or has depression or anxiety or any of the other standard psychological disorders where we are able to provide people with a thumbnail paradigm of how to approach the patients. It's been schedule to have a formulation of the patient when it's talking about before about the, ah, blind eclecticism is that the patients do not have a therapist, do not have any kind of formulation of the patient and as we solve of that they just go blunt aimlessly and when there's successful, it may be due to chance to the fact that many patients get better any how or it maybe that they just happened, ah, hit the lucky number as they, ah, as they progress a lot. Ah, now I don't believe that there will be just one psychotherapy just like when there's one medicine today. Back in the 1900s, there was three branch of medicine homeopathy and osteopathy and was then called, ah, allo-- allocentric, ah, medicine. Ah, but eventually they merge and there's just one medicine now and, ah, I think in the future to repeat what I've said, I think that the therapy in the future is going incorporate all of the best methods that could be proved and then give the therapist a kind of arsenal of therapeutic techniques that he can utilize for a specific patient with a specific problem and hopefully the research will be able to guide the therapist in selecting which therapeutic approach is gonna be the most effective, ah. 

00:44:50
JUDITH BECK Oh, we have, ah, Dr. Seligman has a question for you. 

00:44:55
DR. SELIGMAN Hey, good afternoon, Tim. 

00:45:00
AARON BECK Hi, Rudy. Thank you, so see you next week. 

00:45:00
DR. SELIGMAN We have-- we have lunch on Friday, I think. Ah, ah, given the theme of the conference, Tim, the evolution of psychotherapy, do you think cognitive therapy and psychotherapy will just continue to gradually improve? Or is it possible that some discontinuous step function might occur for psychotherapy and cognitive therapy? 

00:45:30
AARON BECK Well, it's, it's hard to predict the future. Right now, I don't see the trends in that direction but, but certainly, ah, the trends come up now. Peop-- my eye open, I think cognitive therapy has always been, in my own approaches let's say, not speaking for cognitive therapy alone. My own approach is that to the cognizant of new approaches and to give them the benefits over doubt. It always makes me shiver when people say the cognitive therapy is very narrow. Ah, we once write-- I once wrote a book, uhm, for the secret strength... 

00:46:10
JUDITH BECK The integrative power. 

00:46:15
AARON BECK The integrative power of cognitive therapy and I think that cognitive model is such-- that it can accommodate well almost new things. Now it could be that there would be a subterranean explosion. They'll go in a totally different direction and if so, we'll just have to wait and see. And I do have something else I wanted to say, Judith, ah, it has to deal with focus. I, I mention earlier that, ah, focusing is a very prop of technique and I don't think it's been used enough. So patient with chronic pain or, ah, hallucinations, or other conditions can refocus their attention or particularly people with panic attack can get a immediate relief of symptoms, ah, while refocusing, the relief of symptoms of course, may only be temporary but it makes the patient feel better and it gives them some sense of control, some sense that there is, ah, a future for them. The other type of focusing is what I was mentioning before which is focusing on-- refocusing on values. I once have a patient who's sent to me consultation, ah, who was very depressed after he failed to win the Nobel Prize in economics and, uhm, over the course of the session, we can now kind of telescope this, in the course of the session, I went through the falling with him. I asked him how important is it to you to, ah, to get the price, to, to be top of your field? How-- how much investment do you have in that? And he said, "About 90%." I then asked about his family and, uhm, I asked him about his children and, ah, in the course of time, he got into that he started to weep and I said-- I asked him why? And he said, "When, when I was growing up, doctor, my father was always away and I thought I would never be that way with my children." And so I said, "Now, as you look at it, now, how, how do you feel?" He said, "Oh, I-- I've realize how important my children are to me." Now I asked him about other things like, ah, his interest in music, his interest in friends, ah, his interest in sports and so on, and finally, I asked him, "What's your breakdown now of all how important everything is?" He said, "Well, well, I'd give my children like 40% and I friends 20% and I'm sorry the activity is 20%," he said, "I guess by work, it would be 20%." So he said, "Well, that adds up to 100%." And I asked him, "Well, how about your wife?" And, ah, okay, so, the point of all is I got him to focus on something other than his big egocentric demands and got him to focus on something other than himself and he was able to do that. Ah, he started to feel better. 

00:49:45
JUDITH BECK A wonderful story. We have a question over here. 

00:49:50
 Well, Dr. Beck, I work in Atlanta with an-- a sort of community treatment team and our primary, ah, patients are schizophrenic and, ah, not to your surprise, they have homelessness, incarceration, ah, joblessness, ah, addiction, a number of challenges. Ah, I happened find one book in the bookstore authored by someone named Beck that I'm looking forward to read but I'm wondering if you and your daughter might have some comments on, ah, the use of, ah, psychotropic drugs. It, it seems to be such a focus today and, ah, and especially, with this community treating them and, ah, I'm wondering, ah, how I approach this. Ah, some of these patients are very resistant to, ah, taking the drugs or staying on a regimen with the drugs and, ah, obviously the focus on managing hallucinations is, is so, ah, much a part of my work so, ah, I'm interested in your thoughts on that. 

00:50:55
AARON BECK Well, in one way, I think I'm authorized to answer the question in other way not. 

00:51:00
JUDITH BECK We, we can't see you very well. 

00:51:05
AARON BECK What? What did you say, Judith? 

00:51:05
JUDITH BECK We, we cannot see you very well. Oh, there we go. Great. 

00:51:10
AARON BECK You hear me okay now? 

00:51:15
JUDITH BECK Yes, perfect. 

00:51:15
AARON BECK Okay, so we've done a lot of work with the homeless both in the contract with the city of Philadelphia and also with the PA. Ah, and now, as it, as it happens the individuals who work with homeless have had no background really in, ah, understanding mental illness and certainly not in cognitive techniques. Uhm, however, the frontline work is-- are totally dedicated to what they're doing and with some education about, uhm, about psychological mechanism, psychological disorders, and kind of a border down type of cognitive therapy, they could start to do the job. The big problem is that many of the homeless don't want to go to shelters and it was often as the good reason because they cherish their belongings and, uhm, they're afraid they're gonna lose their belongings. They're afraid they get beat up and so on and so the city of Philadelphia is trying to, uhm, provide, ah, reasonable housing for them so the big trick is to work with the frontline work as to gradually, ah, hit, hit the patients into the homes. Now, where I feel I'm not authorized is I'm not sure that the big answer is, ah, taking medication for these people. Ah, ah, I think that once they start to see some light at the head of the tunnel, ah, a lot of the psychotic symptoms are going to start to disappear and I would personally rather see a lot of support, a lot understanding and, and the use of some of the basic cognitive techniques for the delusions, hallucinations which have been proven to be fairly successful. Ah, and the reason about drugs, isn't personally I hate drugs but it's because the patients hate drugs and if you get on this side of, ah, being the authority while trying to force drugs down this route is going to interfere with the engagement. So, ah, in my experience, if you're emphasizing engagement, unless the taking of drugs, I think they seem to do better. 

00:53:50

00:53:55
JUDITH BECK We have about five minutes left. Did you have any other remarks you wanted to make or we could - 

00:54:00
AARON BECK Yeah. 

00:54:00
JUDITH BECK - take more questions? 

00:54:00
AARON BECK One is often asked has to deal with, uhm, again with the humanistic tradition and to whether we care or whether we cannot corporate into our cognitive model with-- without forcing it and whether we cannot-- can incorporate the, the newer trends. Uhm, and so actually, we do and I wanted mention that. First of all, from our people we have the strength base approach that Christine Padesky has provided. We have the positive psychology of approach that Martin Seligman, ah, we have the active approach that are people from Drexel, ah, and then we have, ah, DBT and a few of the approaches. So it's not as not though we're trying to just have a conglomeration of techniques but what we want to do is have available, a variety of approaches so that when one approach doesn't seem to be appropriate for particular individual that we will have other approaches. And then... 

00:55:20
JUDITH BECK And, and have it-- I'm sorry. Using different approaches doesn't, ah, necessarily change though your conceptualization of the patient. Is that right? 

00:55:30
AARON BECK Yeah. Yeah, I think it right and I, I should emphasize that so I think you can draw on the cognitive model to, to arrive your formulation for the patient. Then based on your formulation, you're going to be able to get some general idea of which approach are gonna used so if there's a panic patient in all likelihood, you can use the, ah, approach that we have use in terms of, ah, inducing the panic and then enabling the, the patient and then facilitating the patient's understand of that. At the other far end, the, ah, approach that we use with schizophrenic is, and the surface seems to have nothing in common with the approach we use, let's say to depression or anxiety and yet, it's based on a formulation which may be quite similar but would take it into a count the patient's, ah, neurocognitive deficits and it's behavior. So I'd say, the first thing if you want to treat a patient is to have a good case formulation. Once you have the formulation, then you have to use your judgment as to what technique you're gonna use. 

00:56:45
JUDITH BECK And I think we're, we're, we're about out of time so please say hi-- hi to mom and I'll see you both in a couple of days and, ah, thank you for doing this with us today.
