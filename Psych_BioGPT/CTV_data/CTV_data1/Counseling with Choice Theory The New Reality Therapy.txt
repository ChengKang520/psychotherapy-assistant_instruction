00:02:55
RODNEY Yeah, I'm just . . . 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Nothing new there is there? 

00:03:00
RODNEY I don't know, man, I don't know. There's got to be something better than this. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN People been telling you what to do for quite awhile haven't they? 

00:03:10
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's one thing people always have advice for teenagers. 

00:03:15
RODNEY Yeah, what's up with that? 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN I don't know, I don't know. I don't ever give them much advice cause I figure that, you know, it's your life. 

00:03:25
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN I'd like to maybe help you live it, a little better if we could talk about it, but basically, the standard advice is go to school, keep your mouth shut, stay away from drugs, you know, study hard, go to college. that's the advice you've been hearing since you're 4 years old isn't it? 

00:03:40
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN So, I'm not going to add to it. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah I don't got nothing to say about all of that. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. How did you get here to see me today did someone tell ya how to come in to see the counselor? 

00:03:55
RODNEY Uh, my mom said that, uh, she's going to put me in the hospital if I don't, uh, talk to somebody, uh . . . 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh, well. 

00:04:05
RODNEY So . . . 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Do you like the hospital? You've been there, I guess, before. 

00:04:10
RODNEY Uh, I was there. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:04:15
RODNEY Yeah, I was. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I haven't read your history, so I don't know much about cha, but I figure I'd rather meet you than meet what some people wrote about ya on a piece of paper. 

00:04:25
RODNEY Yeah, yeah. Uh, I don't know, I, I , I don't know what to do. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN Must be something that's got your mom a little bit bent out of shape if she wants to put you back in the hospital. 

00:04:45
RODNEY Oh, she thinks that, man, she's just like, uh, like, like it's the, I'm the same kid that she wants me to be, you know she has this idea, you know and like I'm into my, you know like I do rap man. I do, I'm down with that. I do rap. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:05:10
RODNEY And I'm a, like the freestyle rap champion of the county. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN No kidding. 

00:05:15
RODNEY Yeah and, uh . . . 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN So just once you get going it just keeps coming you right? 

00:05:20
RODNEY Yeah, but you know I, I, gotta, you know I can't, uh, I need to smoke some weed. I mean it helps me like loosen up and say what I need to say, you know. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:05:30
RODNEY So she gets all freaked out about that and she doesn't know the difference between weed and she thinks it's like heroin or crack man. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:05:40
RODNEY I tried to show her, but then she flushes it down the toilet. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, probably if you're going to smoke a little weed, you ought to kind of keep it quiet from your mom. 

00:05:50
RODNEY Ah, I was trying to be open with her, man, let her in on what's going on with me. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, maybe she needs a little kind of preparation for being open with ya. she's not, you know everybody tells her that if your kid smokes weed he's a step away from going down the drain and parents get upset about. 

00:06:10
RODNEY I told her to try it man, it would take the edge off. 

00:06:10
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's unlikely she'll do that. Does she do any drugs at all? Does she take alcohol? 

00:06:20
RODNEY She drinks like a fish. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN So she takes alcohol, that's her drug. 

00:06:20
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN How about you? Have you tried alcohol? 

00:06:25
RODNEY Yeah, puked my brains out, so . . . 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30
RODNEY I don't know. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN How about when you go to the hospital, the probably give ya what they call medication. Ever had any, taking some of that now? 

00:06:40
RODNEY Yup. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, cause when you mix that up with alcohol and marijuana you don't know what's going to go on inside your brain. 

00:06:45
RODNEY Yeah, yeah that's what they told me. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:45
RODNEY That stuff, I didn't like that either. Oh, God it, I couldn't even do any rap. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN I don't think you can rap on that kind of medicationm no. 

00:06:55
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN If you can breathe your doing pretty well. You know that's, uh, definitely, if you're the rap champion of the county on medication you really must be a good rapper, there's no doubt about that. 

00:07:10
RODNEY Dude. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN What? 

00:07:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:07:15
RODNEY Man. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN I saw a movie with Eminem in it, are you like Eminem at all? Is that something like that? He was good I mean, I mean, I couldn't believe it. 

00:07:25
RODNEY Yeah he's, he's got some nice push, I can rap with that dude. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. You get into these rap contests sometimes with like you know like the dueling rapist and that. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, freestyle man, freestyle. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
RODNEY Yeah, I tried to get a pass, uh, when I was in the hospital you know and and, uh, they hit, they were having, this radio station was having like this freestyle rap thing. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:45
RODNEY And like the winner was going to be able to get like this like go to LA man, and, and . . . 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, LA. 

00:07:50
RODNEY Be able to, uh, you know ge-, be able to, uh, I, I, was thinking I was be able to get a recording contract. I was sure it was going to come down that way, and the hospital would not let me go out on that, uh, pass man, I . . . 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN You told them where you were going? 

00:08:00
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Well, you should have lied about that, that would have been better off than doing that. 

00:08:05
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:08:05
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Because hospitals and rap, you know the people run the hospitals, they don't like rap. 

00:08:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:08:15
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN They like hallucination, illusions, (inaudible ), but they don't like rap. 

00:08:20
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:08:20
RODNEY Hallucination, illusions? 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN They probably told you about that too haven't they? 

00:08:25
RODNEY The hallucinations? 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Well, something like that, yeah. 

00:08:25
RODNEY Yeah, I thought that was the, the drugs they were giving me. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, well some of those drugs can do that, yeah. I mean they got strong drugs out there. 

00:08:35
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN These aren't street drugs you know, people on the street probably don't take them very much. 

00:08:40
RODNEY Yeah,(inaudible ) Dude, you're a doctor man, how come how come your not giving me some drugs? 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN I don't give drugs because I'm, I'm, I'm an anti-drug doctor. 

00:08:50
RODNEY Can you prescribe some marijuana for me? I've got like some chronic back pain man? 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. No I, I don't, I don't prescribe drugs, legal or illegal. If you have a sore tooth I might give you a little penicillin that's about as far as I go. 

00:09:05
RODNEY Wel,l I heard that you know, you can prescribe it you know for like chronic pain and . . . 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
RODNEY I'm getting older man. 

00:09:10
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Well, if you count on me for drugs, I mean, I talk to people. I come talk to you, try to get to know ya. Trying sometimes, talk to you about some things you haven't thought about. There may be ideas you haven't thought about that I could help you with that could eventually help you, you know. 

00:09:30
RODNEY Uh, I don't think anyone can help me with this shit man. What's going down? I don't know man. I don't want to go to school. I don't wanna, live with my folks, but oh, God, I don't know how to do anything. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN No you know how to do a lot of things. You just don't want to do what people tell you to do that's what you don't like to do. 

00:09:55
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN That's not anything abnormal about that. 

00:10:00
RODNEY Yeah, wha-, how. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Some kids go with it and some kids don't. You're one of the kids that don't. 

00:10:10
RODNEY Yeah, so what's left for us man? 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Well, that's what you got to figure out is what's left. There must be some stuff left if you have any, you know, you consider yourself, you know when you're thinking okay, do you consider yourself a pretty sharp guy? 

00:10:25
RODNEY I don't know. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:10:25
RODNEY I get ah, I can't even get a D man. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, you're here. You get here. We're talking. Start. 

00:10:40
RODNEY Well, my mom made me do this. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Well, you're mom's worried about you, you know. She loves you and she wants you to be a different kind of a person and, but she would still like you to get some help. Maybe find some kind of a way to go that you could get along with her and still get along with yourself. 

00:11:00
RODNEY Yeah, it would be good if somebody would just like let you alone and, like, kind of, you know, just, just once, just kind of like see what, what you like to do and . . . 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
RODNEY Stuff like, you know what I mean man? 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
RODNEY Just see who you are, you know. I don't even know what that is (inaudible ) 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Well I'm not here to bug you, but I'm here to talk with you and talking with you doesn't have to be bugging ya. What are the things you like to do? If we let you alone to do what would you want to do? I mean, rap you told me and that sounds good to me. 

00:11:35
RODNEY Yeah, well, I could do what I wanted man, I'd like to, go score an ounce and, uh, you know, go downtown, and, um, get together with some of my hommies and I would just like to get high and just sit out on the street and do some music and do some rapping and, uh . . ..If I could do that I would be fine. And I know somebody would discover me, I know because it's good stuff. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Now to some extent you've done that though haven't you? Because you said you became the county champion in a rap little contest. 

00:12:20
RODNEY Yeah. It won't. . . yeah, the whole time I'm like, uh, sitting in school. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:30
RODNEY I got like these, uh, rap tunes running through my head. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, that's good. I mean, you got something going through your head that you enjoy. There's nothing illegal about having thoughts about rap. That's fine, they can't put you in jail for that. 

00:12:45
RODNEY Suddenly I hear my name, Rodney. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Right in your head, huh? 

00:12:50
RODNEY No, no, no, no, no, it's the teacher. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Oh, the teacher. Oh yeah, that's, uh, all right. Well yeah, Rodney she knows your name. 

00:13:00
RODNEY She calls on me, and she's been like talking about some fucking bullshit about like, uh, you know in 1942 such in such happened. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:10
RODNEY And World War 2. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, teachers like dates, they like dates a lot you know. 

00:13:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN If you know your dates you get along pretty well in school. 

00:13:15
RODNEY Yeah, asking you a questions. It's like suddenly all the kids are laughing, you know, and it's like, and then she says, you know, you got that look like a chicken in your face, you know, in your eye like your like, you know how like when your thinking about something else. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Well the teacher really doesn't know what to do with ya, you know, she teaches and you don't you know, pick up on what she's teaching. But I suppose if you wanted to you could. There's nothing they teach at school that a guy that can rap couldn't pick up on. I mean, rap's a lot harder than learning a few dates. 

00:14:00
RODNEY Yeah, I don't wanna, I mean that stuff has nothing to do with anything, oh God. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN But that's the job of school. They want to teach you things that have nothing to do with anything, cause they got to fill out this whole year and that's how they work it. 

00:14:20
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:14:20
RODNEY You went to school? 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, what I did is I just went along with it. I said what, you know, this is school and and you go along with it. It wasn't that hard. The teacher asked me a couple of questions I answered, they let me alone. It was okay. 

00:14:35
RODNEY Oh man, wasting tr- . . . how long did you go to school? You're, you're a doctor right? 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Oh, yah, 16, 17 years. 

00:14:40
RODNEY Uh, God man. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN My father thought I'd never finish, you know and . . . 

00:14:45
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN He said will you finish before I die and I did. You know actually did work that out. 

00:14:55
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:15:00
RODNEY What's the point? 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Well, the point is right now, Rodney, you're very unhappy. The point is is to figure out a way that you can become happier and stay out of jail. That would be the point, in my opinion. 

00:15:15
RODNEY I don't know man some of the best rap songs are about going to jail man. It's kind of like . . . 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, but don't, don't take those guys that have never been to jail, some of them have and their out now rapping. They don't want to go back. Jail is not good. I, if you think it's good I won't argue with you but my experience with people who have been to jail is they don't like it. 

00:15:30
RODNEY I just want to have it on my resume man. I just wanna . . . . 

00:15:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Well, well maybe you could figure out 30 days or something like that, but . . . 

00:15:40
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN You don't want 10 years on your resume, believe me. 

00:15:45
RODNEY Yeah. Um, so what happened, what's supposed to, what do you, what, are you supposed to do something for me man? 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN Yea we're talking. That's all I do. 

00:15:55
RODNEY Hmm. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible )any dates or anything like that I'll give you a test. I don't put you down and tell you you're a bad boy. I don't tell you this that or the other thing. I tell you you're unhappy cuz I'm right about that. 

00:16:10
RODNEY Now how do you know that, man. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Well I'm looking at ya, and I'm listening to you and your not happy. There's no life in ya. 

00:16:15
RODNEY Uh . . . 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Got a girlfriend? 

00:16:25
RODNEY Uh, she dumped me. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN She dumped ya. 

00:16:30
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Do you have any idea why she dumped ya? 

00:16:35
RODNEY Uh, she likes somebody. She likes this other dude you know, so I don't know. 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:45
RODNEY She started . . . 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN Or something the other dude, the way he dealt with her, he, she liked better than you. 

00:16:55
RODNEY Yeah, yeah man, he had a job. 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Well, girls tend to kind of like guys that have jobs that's, uh, that's something they like. 

00:17:00
RODNEY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Not every girl but, but quite a few. 

00:17:05
RODNEY Yeah, he, he bought her some nice shit man. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
RODNEY Bought her off. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, how old is he? 

00:17:15
RODNEY 18. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Hmm, a little older than you, huh? 

00:17:20
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN Well, just because a girl dumped ya, not the end of the world, there's other girls around. 

00:17:25
RODNEY Oh, yeah, man, I ah, you know like I wanted to like bang their heads together for about two minutes and then it was like, uh, I'll find somebody else man. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, you're pretty discouraged though it sounds to me. 

00:17:45
RODNEY Ah, yeah. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN I think, what we're going to have to do Rodney, you and I, is maybe become a little bit friendly and get to know each other a little better. You don't talk to adults very easy, and I'm an adult. I'm an old adult. You know I've been to school 17 years and God knows what else. 

00:18:05
RODNEY Yeah, yeah you're pretty, pretty old guy man. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:10
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN True, true. 

00:18:20
RODNEY Ah, man I, I just don't see how someone like you, is going to understand someone like me. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Have I said anything so far you haven't understood? 

00:18:30
RODNEY Naw, I understand, I understand what you're saying. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Old people no different from young people. There's some you can get along with and some you can't. I probably could be someone you could get along with cuz I'm a little bit on your side. You don't have many people on your side that's for sure, especially adults. 

00:18:45
RODNEY Well, I've had people say that man, but then they like fucking stab me in the back man, you know. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN Stab you in the back. 

00:18:55
RODNEY Yeah, I mean they . . . 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN We're they being nice to ya, and then next thing they were telling you got to go to school and that kind of stuff? 

00:19:00
RODNEY Yeah, and just, yeah. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm not going to tell you that. I'm not going to tell you got to anything except breathe and that I think you'll do. 

00:19:10
RODNEY I got to do that. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, you do. And then I want to talk to ya and get to know you, cuz your not over loaded with adult people that talk to ya without giving ya all kinds of advice. 

00:19:20
RODNEY So what do you do? 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN One thing you'll run into is a lot of adults with advice, until you get to be about 90 then they stop. 

00:19:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:19:35
RODNEY Wow, you're 90? 

00:19:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN No. No, I'm not even there yet people still give me advice too. 

00:19:45
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN People are telling me all the time, you got to give kids drugs. Drugs are the only thing that will help them. I say drugs are their problem why should we give them drugs? They don't like that. I have my troubles, too. 

00:20:00
RODNEY They lecture you? 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, they kind of tell me that I'm doing the wrong thing by not drugging kids out of their minds, yeah. All the time. You ever take Ritalin? 

00:20:10
RODNEY Yeah, that one I've been on man. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, Ritalin, yeah, they think, sometimes they think Ritalin is gonna make a man out of you or something like that. 

00:20:20
RODNEY Dude your tripping. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN No, I'm not tripping. 

00:20:20
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:20:20
RODNEY Hell. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Ritalin does good for the company that makes it that's the only thing it does any good for. 

00:20:30
RODNEY I don't know why they don't prescribe, like, some cool drugs man like . . . 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Actually, uh, they don't want you to have cool drugs, they want you to have drugs that, I don't know what they want to do. I don't ever give any of them so I don't know. I don't take them either. I don't even smoke. 

00:20:45
RODNEY Wow man. So you ever smoke pot man? 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN I don't smoke anything. 

00:20:50
RODNEY Wow. You should try boomers man. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN I'm not going to try anything. 

00:21:00
RODNEY Aw, it . . . 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN But I'm, abuse is. 

00:21:00
RODNEY It is so cool man. It is it, like opens up the whole world. 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, and then the worlds open then what do you do? 

00:21:10
RODNEY Man then it's just like the rap just flows and like you hear music and you can like hear it in a totally new way and like people's faces man you can, like, see into the soul. I mean it is so cool. 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, but in order to get that drug whatever it is, you got to treat people in your life different, so they begin to think well he's okay. See the people that can help you, you don't treat them very well and then they don't help you. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN You'll notice some kids . . . 

00:21:45
RODNEY I don't even know how to do that. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, well that's what maybe you and I could talk about. Because it's to your advantage to get along with your mother and she ain't always threatening ya and worried about ya, and putting ya in the hospital, and they'll load ya up with drugs. I mean it's your advantage to be smarter than you are. 

00:22:05
RODNEY Well she ain't gonna listen to me, I mean, can you talk to her about that man? 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Sure I could talk to her about it, but she ain't gonna listen to me either until she sees some kind of a, what she'd call a positive change in you. I'm not saying you have to change but act like you have 

00:22:20
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:22:25
RODNEY Sh-, ah. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN The difference between people, uh, some people and other people is that underneath their pretty much the same but some people act a little better. They're the ones that have the keys in the world. 

00:22:35
RODNEY Man that, you mean, like fake it all the time? 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Fake it til you make it, you know what they say. 

00:22:45
RODNEY Hmm. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Something to think about. You're fighting a big world out there and the world out there is not doing ya much good, and yet you say when you have these boomers you feel good. 

00:22:55
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:23:00
RODNEY Yeah, they're hard to get. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, they are. You could even probably if you got real smart feel good without the boomers. 

00:23:10
RODNEY Wow. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Something to think about anyway. 

00:23:10
RODNEY I, I don't think I could feel that good. 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN Probably not, but you could still feel pretty good. 

00:23:20
RODNEY Huh? 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN So you're a living in a world that's real hard for you to get along in, and what you've been doing is say to the world, you know, screw it, you know, and that kind of thing and that didn't work. And for some reason the world goes after guys like you and here's where you are. Mother threatening to put you in a hospital, they'll dope you even more than your doped now and you got to learn a little bit about how to get along in this world out there. The world that you rap about. That's what you rap about. So you're on your way [. 

00:23:55
00:24:00][sil.] 

00:24:05
RODNEY Man, the world it's . . . 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's a world. 

00:24:05
RODNEY Messed up man. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN You need to live in it, yeah, yeah. And whatever else you and I do in our lives we're always going to end up in this world. And that's the way it is. Some people deal with the world smart and some people deal with it stupid, and smart is better. 

00:24:30
RODNEY What if your just stupid man? 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, you're not as good, as if you were smart, but my opinion is that most people are smart if they just think a little more, get to know people a little better, do a few different things than they're doing and then they get smart. 

00:24:50
RODNEY I don't know man. I think if you're stupid, you're stupid forever. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN You think stupidity is forever, huh? 

00:25:00
RODNEY It seems that way. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, I don't, I don't agree with you there. 

00:25:10
RODNEY Have you known like a, stupid ass who became like smart? 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Well, I've worked with a lot of what they call adolescents, that's what you are. And a lot of them were stupid and then we got to know each other and they became smarter, and that's what I'm offering you, and you got nothing to lose. Except for maybe some of your stupid, which would be okay. 

00:25:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:25:35
RODNEY What? 

00:25:40
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN If you talk to me and you kind of begin to say maybe this guy has something to say, and you listen and we talk back and forth and then you have a chance of becoming smarter cause that's been my experience. If it hadn't been my experience, I wouldn't be talking to ya, because I'd say, well you can't help kids like you. And I think, in a way I could help you. I get to know you and that would help you. You don't know an adult like me. You never met one really. 

00:26:10
RODNEY So if I, i-, i-, if I talk to you, I'm going to get smarter? 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN I think so, yeah. 

00:26:20
RODNEY What do I have to say? 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN I can't tell you what to say. I can tell myself. I can only say my part; you have to say your part. But if we talk then we have a conversation and from the conversation people get smarter. That's what counseling is all about. I'm a counselor. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN But I'm not trying to tell you to live your life differently. I'm saying to ya that there's a possibility you could learn to live your life differently if we talk. Cuz right now in terms of adults you probably don't have anyone to talk to. And adults are important when you're in the world. You got to deal with them. Like they're forcing you in here basically to see me, and if you learn to deal with me, I don't know exactly how you'll do it but that's my job. We work on it. We talk. I'm not going to give you any pills and tell you these are going to make it better. But I am gonna advise you a little bit as we talk that maybe there's ways you could get along with your mother better which would be good for you. It would be good for her too but, good for you is what I'm concerned about. I'm not here to help your mother out. I'm here to help you out. 

00:27:55
RODNEY She needs the help. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN You could maybe help her. You could do a lot to help your mother. 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:10
RODNEY She could be smarter. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Hmm, one thing she isn't is very smart in how she deals with you. And she knows it. 

00:28:25
RODNEY Cuz you didn't talk to her about that. 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Well I am, maybe you are too. Maybe we talk to her together. 

00:28:35
RODNEY Uh, does my stepdad got to come to that? 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Nobody's got to come to it. 

00:28:40
RODNEY Aw, man he won't let anyone talk. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN If you were real smart you could even learn how to talk to your stepdad. 

00:28:50
RODNEY Well, you try to get a word in when you're mad. You try to get that guy to shut up. He's like a runaway train. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. You know sometimes with a runaway train you learn to get out of the way. To stand on the track and get hit, that's not very smart. 

00:29:10
RODNEY This is like a train man, that follows you around and he lays down the tracks right in front. 

00:29:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN  Well, well that's, that's a very, very intelligent statement. I mean I haven't heard one person say that ever. You know, he's like a train that lays down the tracks and follows ya. 

00:29:30
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:29:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN  I can see why you can do rap you got 

00:29:35
RODNEY I've done rap about him. 

00:29:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN You can make a rap song out of that. Laying down the tracks, laying down the tracks, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, fuck him, you know, that's rap. 

00:29:45
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:29:50
RODNEY That? 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Well, I'm poor at it you know, I don't ever done it before. 

00:29:55
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN It's illegal for a guy my age to even think about rap. I'm amazed when I rented the movie on Eminem I'm amazed they gave it to me, you know. Hobbling into the store and they gave it to me. 

00:30:05
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN And I was, after I saw it, I was willing to take a test on it, it was a really good movie. They didn't give any test though, they rent to you without giving a test. In school you'll watch it and the next thing they'll want to give you a test on it that's the problem with school./ 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:25
RODNEY  You should do some more rap now. 

00:30:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN I'm rapped out for the day. But I'd like to hear you do some. You could prepare a little what they call psychiatric rap I'd like to hear it. You've been . . . 

00:30:45
RODNEY Psychiatric rap? 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Well yeah I'm kind of a psychiatrist. That's the kind of person I am and you've seen a lot of psychiatrists in your day believe me, you know. There better than they used to be. They used to just smoke and look at you, but now they have to say something so . . . 

00:31:05
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, look at all the guys in your age that bump into psychiatrists and counselors and everything and I think that make a great rap thing. I don't care what you say. 

00:31:20
RODNEY Yeah, I can't yeah. I did do a rap about that hospital , man. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN About the hospital, yeah. 

00:31:30
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:31:35
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN Now see that's being smart. Rapping about the hospital now that's smart. 

00:31:45
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN When you do rap do you ever write it out or do you just have to remember it all. 

00:31:50
RODNEY I have a recorder. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Record it, that's the same as writing. Any other recording? 

00:31:55
RODNEY Cuz it just comes man. It just comes. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Maybe you could make a recording, with that little tape of some kind little video, audio tape or something. 

00:32:05
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Bring it in and I'd like to hear your recording. I really would. I mean, that's the way I could get to know you cuz that's what you enjoy, you like and you create it. See the difference between smart people and stupid people is: smart people are creative. You've heard that word. They create things. You write, you created the rap out of your own head there it was, and it feels good. 

00:32:35
RODNEY Yeah, rap is the truth. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. It's as close to the truth as any other truth. Nobody knows what the truth is but your, your opinion is as good as anyone else's. 

00:32:50
RODNEY When it comes out it sounds like the truth. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, well yeah it does. 

00:32:55
RODNEY It sounds like everything else is just like . . . 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Those train tracks following you around with a train on it that's, that sounds very truthful to me. Rodney, I may use that with some of the other people I see and I'm going to say courtesy of Rodney. Cuz I don't like to steal stuff without giving you credit. 

00:33:20
RODNEY I'd like some royalties from that. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Hmm? 

00:33:20
RODNEY I'd like some, I'd like, uh, if you use it I would like half the cut on your session. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN No, I can't get any money for it. 

00:33:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN If you make any money from your rap, or I help you with your rap and listen to you and encourage ya, any money you make is yours. I don't want a dime. I'd be happy. Those are the things that make me happy. When I work with a guy like you that starts out like he's three-quarters dead, then he comes alive it's very exciting for me. 

00:33:55
RODNEY Dead? 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah you're not dead quite but, um, em, it close. But when you're rapping you're not that way. When your rapping your eyes are sparkling, your jumping and your moving. 

00:34:10
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:15
RODNEY Yeah that's pretty good. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Your brains all alive, it's really alive when your rapping. 

00:34:35
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. And once your brains alive it can do a lot of things that it's not doing now. Good things I think. 

00:34:45
RODNEY It's like a runaway train as well, but . . . 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:45
RODNEY . . . it isn't telling any other people what to do. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN Now you're the engineer. 

00:34:55
RODNEY It's just about the world. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's, uh, we can't get away from that, I mean, some people they kind of get away from it for awhile, but even they come back. 

00:35:10
[sil.] 

00:35:30
RODNEY Say something dude. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Well, well I'm sitting here like you I'm thinking. I've enjoyed being with you this has been very, you know, I've enjoyed it. 

00:35:45
RODNEY Yeah, it's okay. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN And when you're talking to people like a counselor and it feels okay then it's good counseling. You would feel, like, oh God. The person I talk to says talk to me I figure well I, you know, I'm on the right track. Just because I can't figure out what to say well . . . 

00:36:00
RODNEY I never know what to say. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Ah, yes you do, you said a lot. When you say you never know what to say, what your really saying, in my opinion, you have to check it out, I mean I don't know for sure is, the things I want to say, the people don't like. Like you say, if you say certain things to your mother you know she's gonna kind a get all upset and everything, and if you could figure out things to say to her that kind of, she liked and calmed her down, it would help you a lot. Your stepdad maybe just have to learn to kind of, you know, go in a direction he can't lay track to. 

00:36:45
RODNEY Hell, that dude will follow you into the bathroom, man. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm 

00:36:50
RODNEY You'll be sitting there taking a shit and he'll be there man. Talking to you, lecture. Close the door, dude. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:36:55
RODNEY Hmm. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, well he's a problem, but if we talked and got to know each other, I got some things I could teach ya about how to deal with him. 

00:37:10
RODNEY That'd be good. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Right now he thinks he knows everything there is to know and he wants to let you have it and, you could learn to behave in a way that he might say, well maybe I oughtn't talk to this kid so much. 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:30
RODNEY My mom didn't even start drinking until he showed up. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Mm. 

00:37:30
RODNEY I mean, he's the one who drove her to the bottle. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Yup. He may have driven her to the bottle but you could certainly help her with that. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN There are lots of things you can do besides sit around and say the world's all screwed up. Your a part of the world like everybody else. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN What I want to do is kind of see ya again, like, once a week maybe? Bring in a rap record. We get to know each other. It'd be worthwhile for both of us. I'm learning from you, same as your learning from me. You have things to teach me. I don't know it all. 

00:38:35
RODNEY You, teach you to be the old man of rap star man. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. If I can make a lot of money I'll give it to you. 

00:38:45
RODNEY Okay. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN All right, what I'm thinking of doing is I got some guys around here that come to see me, cuz that's what I deal with mostly, what they call adolescents, whatever that means. Maybe get a few of you together in a little group and talk. 

00:39:05
RODNEY Yeah. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN But never tell ya to shut up, or not to say this or that, just talk. Whatever you say is okay. In this office everything you say is okay. No rules. The rule is we get, try to get to know each other. Cuz it's from getting to know each other, that's how we help each other. 

00:39:30
RODNEY Just you and a bunch of kids. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Ah, bunch, I don't know three, four, more not a whole bunch. There's a lot of young people like you around and they've cut I, I watch my hands. They're kind of disconnected from other people. And if they could even get connected with themself and a little bit with me it all works out pretty well. Connected is better. And your connected trains can't run over ya. They bounce off ya when you have good connections. You could maybe do a rap about connections. It's a very interesting word, connections. Some people connect and some don't. And the people that do, they seem to like it better than the people that don't. 

00:40:25
RODNEY Hmm. Yeah, I don't know too much about that. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Hmm, there's lots of things you don't know much about. I could help you with some of that stuff, but if we talk you'll learn a lot. That's one of the problems with school, there's no interaction. It's all bluub, bluub, bluub from the teacher. Tthe bell rings and you leave and bluub, bluub, bluub from another teacher, there's no interaction. I teach too but I like to interact in the process. We kind of you talk, I talk, I talk, you talk, instead of just I talk, I talk, I talk and you go to sleep. 

00:41:10
RODNEY Yeah, that's exactly right man. That's what I feel like doing, sleeping the whole day through school all that nonsense. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, I'm not going to worry about the whole day. I'd like to just get started maybe once a week with you and me and then, I'll tell you about a few other guys and if you say well, bring one of them in, we'll just build a little group here. So there, we're together, we can talk and we're kind of here ta get to know each other and help each other out. 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Okay? 

00:41:50
RODNEY Hmm. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Okay, Rodney, then I'll arrange to see ya next week. Ha yeah, now you're getting right (inaudible ) 

00:42:01
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:42:01
UNKNOWN See I learned something already. I knew this much, but I didn't know what you did over there. See that's the thing I (crosstalk) didn't know. Okay. 

00:42:05
RODNEY (crosstalk)I know, that's how we do it, that's how we do it. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN I know, I know, I'm learning. You're old but you know, we can learn, too. 

00:42:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN All righty, that's good. Actually heard they were videotaping this so we got to kind of be quiet now while they close it down. 

00:42:30
