Clean Language & Systemic Modelling How to use this DVD Caitlin Walker 

00:00:30
CAITLIN WALKER Hello! My name is Caitlin Walker. I'm a managing director of Training Attention Limited. My background was that I lived and grew up in three different continents and so when you le-- learn the rules in one continent and then you moved all the rules that you knew of how to behave that was acceptable, they all start to change. So I guess I've-- you could said I've grown up going how do people make sense of one another? How do rules become embedded? And if those rules aren't working or patterns aren't working, how do they changed? How could you teach people that they have to always do things the way they've done them but, ah, these are the choices. This DVD introduces an exercises that we've developed as an organization to help people to understand the patterns that they run in themselves, the patterns that are running across a team and to get them to a position where they've got more choices about what they do, so that they got more of what they want more of the time. They're fun, they work best in a group, they work best when they delivered personally. So we're trying to do something really extraordinary here. We're trying to get you'd have an understanding and experience of it and we're gonna do that by take you to the exercises by letting you watch other people go through the exercises and to use a manual that allows you to get some background on the exercises. The company principle has always been, if it's useful do you do it to yourself and do you do it to yourself regularly? So, I, as an individual and our company as a whole has lots of experience about what-- having these exercise done regularly? Daily sometimes can do to the way you think and certainly for me, it allows me to be less judgmental. If I don't like something, what I want to happen instead to think very positively and we still have a lot of fun to make sure that things I do are aligned with my values and if I'm not feeling good about something to go to be curious to be interested, to not to get poke down an effort to go, that's interesting. How is that work? And I hope that you enjoy the exercises and get just as interesting curious about yourselves and other people so that you can enjoy what you do more of the time. 

00:02:45
What Would You Like To Know Before We Begin? 

00:02:50
CAITLIN WALKER What I'm gonna be taking you through, ah, the exercises that you would do on a two-day introduction to clean language and to systemic modelling. So before we start, the first question I ask a group is, what would you like to know before we begin? 

00:03:05
What would you like to know before we begin? 

00:03:10
CAITLIN WALKER This is your opportunity to think about the things that you really like to know before you start to learn something. What would you like to know about me? The company? The process? Do you need to know about applications? Do you need to know the philosophy behind it? Or the history of the process? So what would you like to know before we begin? The way that you answer this question will also affect the way that you use this DVD. So for example, if you really need to know how something get to use before you get interested learning it, you may wish to go through to the applications. Then, watch the exercises and then do them. If you really not that interested in the applications, you just like to go and have a go of something, you may want to go through the exercises and then look at what they were about and the philosophies behind them and then how they're used. So that those that had already been used doesn't affect the way you answer them. So, really there's no right way to use this DVD and if you're not sure what's your preference is, simply press play all.

Background Clean Setup 

00:04:30
CAITLIN WALKER The clean setup, the-- for this meeting to be just the way you'd like it to be, it will be like what and then for you to get the most out of this meeting, you will need to be like what and then how can we support you? The, the clean setup started when, when we, we use to co-train when we're first developing systemic modelling and we knew that for us to work together let's say myself and my co-trainer to work together, we knew from experience that the way I'd like things to be and the way they'd like things to be were very unlikely to be the same and the way I like to be supported, the way they like to be supported were unlikely to be the same. So, the clean setup was just the way but before we start anything to set our intentions, to get a model for the-- for what we'd like to have happen, they were to set our states and to be responsible for the way we're gonna be, enjoying whatever was gonna happen and also to tell you the person that we're working with what kind of support we needed. So, originally, this exercise was setup just for two people but as you will see from the footage, then, we realize you could use it with a small group and then we started introducing it to all sorts of meetings and what we found is that often in the meeting and people talk about people having hidden agendas, it's not necessary that agendas are hidden. It's more that people expect to other people to have come to a meeting with the same agenda as them. In fact, they've all always has different agendas. So the idea of this exercise is that before you do any meeting, get everyone, take a few minutes to just go, let's say that's a big project that we're gonna run together and there's 15 people involved in it. So you simply start by going, if this project would be really useful for you, it will be like what? Or this project to be really successful, it will be like what? Get the answer and jot it up on a white board where everyone can see it. 

00:06:35
For this project to be really useful for you it will be like what? Absolutely clean cut and simple and smooth flowing. And when clean cut That's clean cut like what And when clean cut What happens before a project is clean cut 

00:06:35
CAITLIN WALKER So let say, somebody says, uhm, if this project would be really useful, it will be absolutely clean cut and, uhm, simple and smooth flowing. So then you ask one or two clean questions about it. So you just say when it's clean cut, that clean cut like what? We will give you an answer. And then, they might say-- you might say, okay, here's my second clean question, when it's a clean cut what happens before a project is clean cut? And you'll get the answer and it's-- that's as, as far as you ever go. This is not the piece of therapy, it's not a piece of change work. It's just for clarifying the intentions of the people in a group before you start what they want to have happen and then what they want to be like. So you might say, so for it to be clean cut and smooth flowing, you'll need to be like what? You might go, well, I'm gonna need to stay focused. 

00:07:40
Clean Questions For this project to be clean cut and smooth flowing you'll need to be like what? I'm going to need to stay focussed And when you need to stay focussed, where does focussed like that come from, when you need to stay focussed. It comes from me sticking to the agenda And when it comes to you sticking to your agenda so that you're focussed, what kind of agenda is that agenda that you'll be sticking to And when you need to be sticking to the agenda and focussed and for this to be a clean cut smooth flowing project. What support would you want from us? Well I'd like to make sure we don't go round in circles 

00:07:45
CAITLIN WALKER Again, you just throwback a couple of clean questions and when you need to stay focused where does focused like that come from when you need to stay focused? It comes from me sticking to the agenda. So when it comes to you sticking to the agenda so that you're focused, what kind of agenda is that agenda that you'll be sticking to, and get a couple of answers. And then simil-- so when you need to be stick to the agenda and to be focused and for this to be a clean cut smooth flowing project, what support would you like from us? Well I'd like to make sure we don't go round in circles. 

00:08:25
And make sure we don't go round in circles and when we don't go round in circles, what happens just before we don't go round in circles And make sure we don't go round in circles, and when go round in circles what kind of circles could those circles be And make sure we don't go round in circles, and when we don't go round in circles what happens next 

00:08:25
 And make sure we don't go round in circles and when we don't go round in circles, what happens just before we don't go round in circles or different question if you wanted to find out more about those circles, you could say, and make sure we don't go round in circles, and when go round in circles what kind of circles could those circles be or if you wanna find out why we don't want that to happen, you could say, and make sure we don't go round in circles, and when we don't go round in circles what happens next. 

00:09:05
CAITLIN WALKER And it's just-- it takes about a minute per person, you go around and then that's it. 

00:09:10
Exercise Clean Setup It will be like what? What support or resources will you need? 

00:09:15
CAITLIN WALKER For this course, this online DVD and manual course to be really useful for you, it will be like what? Watching and completing these exercises so that they're really useful for you, this whole event will be like what? For you to get the most out of this DVD and this manual and for you to be learning at your best, you will need to be like what? What's the state or attitude that will be most useful for you when you go through this DVD? For you to be the way you need to be, to get the most out of this course and for this course and the learning of clean language and systemic modelling to be just the way you'd like it to be, what support or resources will you need? 

00:10:35
Applications Clean Setup 

00:10:40
CAITLIN WALKER The clean setup is particularly so when there's just two of you about to start a piece of work or project together and if there's just two of you, you can go quite deeply into it, uhm, ask quite a few clean questions that can really unders-- help you to understand the training part there or a friend that you're going to go on holiday with or family member if you're about to buy a new house so you could use on the process of buying new house. Uhm, however, it's now being use very successfully in meetings of up to 30 people and sometimes when there's 30 people, it can go on a bit long. So, you might want to do it and just get, get people into groups of three and to do it together, uhm, because it's, it's fairly easy to, to follow as a protocol. It's being used successfully in schools, uhm, with whole classrooms, has been used with senior managements in schools where they've got like maybe a big behavioral implementation policy and so they use it at the start of a meeting to get clear about all, all the different pe-- uhm, the people got different interests in the school. What is it they want this behavioral implementation policy to be like. So if it's really successful, it will be like what? Uhm, another area that we've been using and recently is, uhm, in senior management project meetings. Ah, again, I didn't think that we would used it here but it's been, it's turned out to be very successfully. It's, ah, here, here that was a, a project of about four years and very desperate people involved in doing it and we found with the clean protocol it was-- it just took the animosity out of any-- out of the meeting and people were able to refer back to, uhm, to points that have been raised at the beginning so if it start to veered off the track, they have quite a humorous way to, to say, well look, we're not satisfying so and so, we need to stand tasks so let's get ourselves back in task school. They'd say, oh, so and so who wanted to really got into the potential consequences of this project going wrong where really it was spent a lot of our meeting in that time but we're not looking after somebody else who wants it to be very fast and smooth flowing. Uhm, there are lots of potential opportunities to use this in, uhm, when you've got, ah, p-- people working in partnership with other organizations where, again, for example, if you have the police, the community, local government and schools working together where you, you do have different agendas it's a fantastic, uhm, to, to use way. You need to ensure the conflicts is kept to a minimum and everybody's agendas are made manifest and important during the meeting. 

00:13:30
Background Learning at Your Best 

00:13:30
CAITLIN WALKER Learning at your best. When people are starting out learning clean questions, it's really important, I'd like to use a juggling metaphor, it's really important that when you're learning to juggle, for example, you don't learn to juggle with glass balls because you spend all your time trying to make sure that you caught them and not enough time training your hand to throw things in the air so that they land near the hand. Similarly when you're learning clean language, it's very important that you start with something that is positive, that goes well for you, that's-- ah, if somebody is practicing asking you the questions but it's okay if they ask them a little bit wrong. So, we start with learning at your best because it does two things. It gives us a positive state to practice clean questions with but also it helps to get people thinking about being in a good learning state so it allows them to be in a good learning state in order to about-- be about to embark on a learning project. So it's just learning clean questions. If, for any reason, learning has been a big issue for your participant, you might want to start with something else. Don't do learning at your best to when you're really confident, you're like what? Or when you're sure of yourself, you're like what? Or, when you're relaxing, you're like what? It doesn't-- it really doesn't matter, uhm, but if you can do learning as I said it's got the double edge of both being getting people into good learning state and give you a positive things in the start with. As people developed their learning metaphors, it's important that you ask questions of them to help them go where does the learning come from, sort of the clean language questions that you can ask where does that come from? What happens just before you’re learning like that? So, for example, if somebody says, "I'm gonna learn at my best. I'm a sponge." What kind of sponge? Does a sponge have a size or shape? Where about is it? And if they say, "Well, it's a natural sponge and it's full of water." Okay, well, if it's full of water, where does the water come from before the sponge is full of water? And just before it's full, it's like what? Ah, then, you might find out, you thought it rushed in but it doesn't. It drips down. Ah, the water drips. Where does the water dripped from? Oh, books I've read, other ideas I've had, stuff I've studied so it's important to remember as people are developing the learning metaphors not to make assumptions but to just keep asking the questions until you built up a good model of what their learning like when they're learning at their best 

00:16:10
Exercise Learning at Your Best When you're learning at your best, you're like what? Exercise on Workshop DVD Clean Questions What kind of.... Anything else about.. Where... Size or shape... Where does .... come from What happens next? When you're learning at your best you're like what? A busy bee 

00:16:15
CAITLIN WALKER When you're learning at your best, you are like what? What's a metaphor or symbol for you learning at your best? I'd like you to draw or map out or describe you when you're learning at your best on a sheet of paper and then to get some clean questions and either ask yourself the clean questions or get some of the details out to ask them for you and to develop your answer or metaphor symbol you when you're a really good learner. Once that symbol is developed, then I'd like you to add in the following information. 

00:17:05
When your learning at your best, what kind of environments allow you to learn really well? Where do you learn at your best? When you're learning at your best, what kind of environments can prevent you from learning? Where do you learn at your best? When you're learning at your best, what's important to you? When you're learning at your best, you're like what? 

00:17:05
CAITLIN WALKER When you’re learning at your best, what kind of environments allow you to learn really well? Where do you learn at your best? When you're learning at your best, what kind of environments can prevent you from learning? Do you like to learn with the people? Alone? In silence? With noise? Where do you learn at your best? When you're learning really well, like that, what kind of behaviors or activities help you to learn really successfully? What kind of skills do you have as a learner? When you're learning really well, what are your abilities that allow you to learn like that? When you're learning at your best, what's important to you? What beliefs do you have about what you're learning or about yourself? What beliefs have you got when you're learning at your best? And when you're learning like that, who are you? What's your purpose? What do you learn like that for? And where does learning like that come from? When you're learning really well, what's your relationship to others? To the world around you? When you're learning at your best, you're like what? 

00:19:05
Applications Learning at Your Best liverpool JMU John Moores University 

00:19:10
CAITLIN WALKER Learning at your best applications. A current application for learning at your best, uhm, is something that we worked on with Liverpool John Moores University and we're turning around an idea on its head. It's been thought for a while that lecturers and teachers need to accommodate very diverse learning styles amongst the students and it's been-- a lot of people found that difficult to do and it's put a strain on the teaching and it doesn't seem to have the effect people wanted. Some of the modelling and the investigation that we've done as an organization has shown that some of the most successful teachers actually just teach to their strengths so they-- when they teach at their best, that's how they teach and being very congruent about that allows the students to adapt to them. 

00:19:55
Creating a learning organisation in a university department. Students - Develop models for learning at their best Lecturers - Develop models for teaching at their best Prior to lecture series students are asked "for you to learn at your best with this lecturer in this environment what are two or three simple things that you could to get the most out of this experience" 

00:19:55
CAITLIN WALKER So what we do in the Liverpool John Moores is we're getting the students to explore when they're learning at their best, their like what? What do they need to learn at their best? What are the environmental factors? When they're very clear about that, we've also then got the lecturers to say when your teaching at your best, you're like what and to relay that out very simply and very clearly for the students and then to set the students tasks as part of their personal development to go for you to learn at your best with this teacher in this environment, what are two or three simple things you can do to get the most out of this learning experience and that seems to be-- it's very exciting work. It seems to be going very well. Another application for learning at your best that I love was, ah, a primary school teacher who'd listen to this and so she went back to his-- her class and she asked the whole class this, when you're learning at your best, you're like what? And then she got them all to draw their metaphors beautifully. So at the whole lesson where they just drew out the metaphors, made lovely pictures with them and then she put them upon the walls and she use it as a shorthand so rather than say, uhm, Johny(ph) you need to be quiet. She'd say, Johny, for you to be that soaring eagle, what can you to be doing now to be soaring like that? Or Sonia(ph), what can I do to help you be that busy bee there? And it just, it just completely took away any telling of criticism and it was simply if they weren't behave in the way that she felt was a good learning state. So what can I do to help you be that thing that you've identified you are and I just thought that was lovely and that subsequently been adapted so even not for learning but for when you're working at best, have had managers who've, who've taken that idea and apply that at work. 

00:21:45
Background The Five Senses 

00:21:45
CAITLIN WALKER The five senses exercise was designed as a way of proving to a group that everyone makes different models of the world, that there's absolutely-- it's indisputable that when somebody says a word, the understanding of the individuals in the group will be different. I originally developed the exercise for use of children, uhm, prior to teach them how to spell or learn math or store information in their system so I, I taught them that they do represent information in different ways and that there's no right or wrong way or that, that what ne-- needs to happen is that we find a successful way for them to remember what they need to remember. When you get better at this exercise, then, it's not just about oh, this person's got a small elephant that's 2D, ah, but this person's got a beautiful soft elephant, they remember from being a child. What you've-- more interesting is not the difference necessarily in their answers but in the way that they answer them. So for example, if somebody says, all right, just came to me and then, you notice later and you, you say to them, feel hot sand and you go, yup, it just came to me, it just-- you think, oh! the way that this person gets information, it that just comes to them or somebody else says, "Well, the first elephant I saw was like this but then I decided about this one," and you find that oh, this person has strategy of having different options and deciding on one. So, as your pattern detection skills get more and more elegant, you notice not just what they're saying but how the information comes to them and if what you are then doing later on is some quite advance training you can refer back to the patterns you notice through in this exercise and so not just the content but the structure of how they think and you can refer them back to those-- the patterns that you've already noticed. A more thing to do is to stop the exercise and say, "Right, she just said that she-- when we said hot sand, she said, oh! I remember being in a (inaudible )." Now what did the rest of you do when you heard her say that? And then you can start to get people to notice that when one person speaks, they've got not only their own hot sand but now they've all made a model of her hot sand as well. And if one them says, "Yeah, yeah, I could just see the beach she was on," and you go, "Well, of course, they can't," and now you got an opportunity as a trainer or a facilitator say, "So just notice we all think I've start to build up an idea of what she's talking about but actually none of us know." So it's a really good, it's a fantastic exercise for teaching people to remember what you see in your mind when someone talks is not what they can see in theirs and to really use the clean questions to start separating out what somebody says and (inaudible ) understanding of it. The five senses exercise is very much a group exercise as this entire DVD is. Now, I'm gonna ask you the questions and I'd like you to think about your answer, you might want to jot your answer down. However, to really get a sense why you do this exercise, you'll need to watch other people do it or get a few of you together in a room and go through this exercise as a small group and post(ph) it, compare your answers before you go on to the next bit. 

00:25:25
Exercise The Five Senses Exercise on Workshop DVD See Hear Smell Taste Feel See an elephant What kind of elephant? Where is it? Is there anything else about that elephant? Hear music What kind of music? What's the first thing that happened when I said hear music? Whereabouts is that music? Feel hot sand Is there anything else about that sand? Whereabouts is that hot sand? What kind of sand is it? Taste lemon What kind of lemon is it? Is there anything else about that lemon? Smell perfume? What kind of perfume is it? Whereabouts is the perfume? Tight What kind of tight? Whereabouts is it? Which of your senses did you represent tight in? Success What kind of success is that? Whereabouts is success? Exercise on Workshop DVD 

00:25:25
CAITLIN WALKER Notice the five senses that you use in to taking information in. What you can see, what you can hear, what you can smell, what you can taste and how you feel. Physically how you feel, emotionally how you feel. I'm re-- I'm going to be asking you questions and give you instructions to use your five senses to represent information to yourself. See an elephant. What kind of elephant is it? Where is it? Is there anything else about that elephant? Hear music. What kind of music is it? What's the first thing that happened when I said hear music? Whereabouts is that music? 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
CAITLIN WALKER Feel hot sand. Is there anything else about that sand? Whereabouts is that hot sand? And what kind of sand is it? And notice, are any of you making pictures before you get a feeling? Did you get the feeling first? Did you hear the sound first? Did you make a picture of the music before you heard it? So just notice what's the first thing that happens as I give you the instruction and then notice whereabouts you see, hear, feel those things whether they have a size or shape, where they're located in relation to you, where there two more senses. Taste lemon. What kind of lemon is it? What's the first thing that happened when I say taste lemon? Is there anything else about that lemon? Smell perfume? What just happened? What kind of perfume is it? Whereabouts is the perfume? Now, that you've gone through those instructions, I'm going to give you two instructions and I've simply like you to notice, what happens as soon as I say those words? Tight. What kind of tight? Whereabouts is it? Which of your senses did you represent tight in? 

00:29:25
[sil.] 

00:29:30
CAITLIN WALKER Success. What kind of success is that? Whereabouts is success? And which of your senses did you represent success in? 

00:29:50
Applications The Five Senses 

00:29:55
CAITLIN WALKER The five senses exercise has been used all over the place with children before we start of learning. We used it with teenagers before we start going okay for this classroom to be really good classroom for you to learn well in, it will be like what because by doing the five senses they all agree and get very interested and, oh, I'm like that, I'm like this, I'm like that and it just lays the ground rules for them going so and so wants it quiet, so and so wants it noisy and all the differences are legitimate in this group. So it's really good for legitimizing. It's been used in police training. Police interviews are suppose to have a blank slate but of course we can't have a blank slate. So I use this exercise quite extensively with training police video interview and as I might say to an officer, we'll take them through the five senses exercise, get them use to the idea that they make meaning of the things the minute they said and then say so, when a, a witness says, he just grabbed me and get them to notice how old is the witness? What kind of a he was a he that grabbed him? Whereabouts that he grabbed him? What kind of grab was it? What direction did he grab him in? And, ah, it's been very, very useful of getting officers to notice that the next question is based not usually on what the person said but on the model that made-- they made in their mind. So, if in your model a child was grabbed by an adult from the front, it will be really natural for you to say, "So, what did he look like?" But if in your model he-- the he grabbed him by his hood from behind, you'd never ask that question, it's not logical. So it's, it's a very good training to-- for getting people to understand stay away from your own models if you-- you're supposed to be getting his fresh evidence from a witness without contaminating it. It's been used over in, uhm, international, ah, team building where it's really, really important to, to train a group at the start, not to make assumptions and also not to use metaphors to other people who won't understand and a lot of English people of a certain age will use, uhm, (inaudible ) the galaxy metaphors. They're only relevant to people of a certain age in a certain country and so, if you, if you use these metaphors or sporting metaphors or sailing metaphors. If you use those metaphors to people who don't understand them, the communication really goes arise. 

00:32:35
A sporting metaphor? 

00:32:35
CAITLIN WALKER So I'll often use this exercises if you go to an international group to just set the idea of a level playing field before you then go into further negotiation in a meeting or project. 

00:32:45
Exercise Circles of Excellence (modelling a usefull state) 

00:32:50
CAITLIN WALKER From (inaudible ) I'll then take you through this exercise. I'd like you to experience it by listening to my voice when I'm doing it with other people. Ask the questions for yourself, go through the exercise yourself and then watch them going through it and notice the difference between your own and theirs and once you've got the circle of excellence and you've developed already a positive state you can then use clean questions to explore it further. 

00:33:15
Circles of Excellence 

00:33:20
CAITLIN WALKER And what I'd like you to do is to imagine a circle on the floor in front of you and this is the starting point for circle of excellence. So, imagine a circle, notice what kind of circle it is, whether as to size or shape or color and then from where you're standing think what's a good state, what's the first state that you'd like to have in your circle of excellence. Once you're thinking about this state and you're thinking about when you're like this, you're like what? What kind of breathing do you have in this state? How's your weight in your body when you're in this state? Is there anything else about you when you're like this? As you associate into this state, step into your circle and allow it rise up and around you. When you're like this, you're like what? Where does this come from? When you're like this, then what happens? Is there anything else about you when you're like this? And then step out. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:35
CAITLIN WALKER And then what's another state that would be a good compliment to that one that you'd also like to put in your circle of excellence? It's a different state you like and as you choose that state, when you're like that, you're like what? What's your breathing like? How does your weight balance through your body? Anything else about you when you're like this. As you decide what state would like to add in, step into your circle. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:30
CAITLIN WALKER And when you're like this, you're like what? Another circle to envelop you. These two states combined. When you're like this, you're like what? Is there anything else about you when you're like this? When you're like this, what happens next? And then step out of your circle. And what's the third state? What else would really go well in that circle of excellence? 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:30
CAITLIN WALKER Think of a third state. When you're like that, you're like what? What kind of state is this? How do you breathe when you're like this? How's your weight distributed through your body? Is there anything else about you when you're like this? Having decided on your third state, step in to your circle and allow it to envelop you, and when you're like this, you're like what? What kind of you is this you? Is there anything else about you? And what happens next? And whereabouts is this? Where is this? And is there anything else about being like this and when you're like this, you're like what? I'd like to, to just give me examples. Just let me know when you're ready to answer. When you're like this, you're like what? 

00:39:25
 Mary Poppins. 

00:39:25
CAITLIN WALKER So, ah, Mary Poppins. Is there anything else about you, Samuelle(ph), when you're Mary Poppins? 

00:39:30
 (inaudible ). 

00:39:34
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ), use different to that. 

00:39:40
 I couldn't. 

00:39:40
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. We can do that with this more later on, yeah. Who's different to Mary Poppins? 

00:39:50
 I'm really, really tired and I keep going and have to really, really go to a-- at the end of the day but I've achieved everything, everything and I can't live (inaudible ) people that I can get clean and (inaudible ). 

00:40:04
CAITLIN WALKER So really, really tired but you keep going. Have achieved everything you need to achieve by the end of the day and, uhm, really (inaudible ) can get clean. 

00:40:10
 Yup. 

00:40:10
CAITLIN WALKER Who's different again? 

00:40:15
 I've got sense of knowing. 

00:40:15
CAITLIN WALKER I've got a sense of knowing and when I've got a sense of knowing where is that sense of knowing? 

00:40:25
 To my body. 

00:40:25
CAITLIN WALKER Sense of knowing to my body? 

00:40:30
 Yup. And more confident and able. 

00:40:30
CAITLIN WALKER More confident and able. When able, where is able? 

00:40:40
 Able is just around me. 

00:40:45
CAITLIN WALKER So able is around me and more confident. 

00:40:45
 Yeah, yeah, that's, uhm, that's sort of here. 

00:40:50
CAITLIN WALKER So confident here and able around me. Now that. 

00:40:55
 Hmm. 

00:40:55
CAITLIN WALKER Someone else? 

00:40:55
 Like a tube. 

00:40:55
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. 

00:40:55
 Going like a spiral. 

00:40:55
CAITLIN WALKER So like a tube? Uh-hmm. 

00:41:05
 A pelter of turquoise light energy flecked with gold. 

00:41:10
CAITLIN WALKER A pelter of turquoise light energy flecked with gold and when turquoise light energy, does that turquoise light energy have a size or a shape? 

00:41:20
 It's like a cylinder that (inaudible ) all around me and (inaudible ). 

00:41:26
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, okay. 

00:41:30
 Invincible. 

00:41:30
CAITLIN WALKER Hmm. When you're invincible where is invincible? 

00:41:35
 If it's moved all around me and anything that have an impact on. 

00:41:45
CAITLIN WALKER So inci-- invincible all around me and anything that I could have an impact on, really? 

00:41:55
 Grounded and comfortable. 

00:41:55
CAITLIN WALKER When you're grounded and comfortable, is grounded like what? 

00:42:00
 Like I've roots into the ground. 

00:42:05
CAITLIN WALKER Like you've roots into the ground. It's great. 

00:42:10
 Energized. 

00:42:10
CAITLIN WALKER Energized, what kind of energized? 

00:42:10
 Like spring. 

00:42:15
CAITLIN WALKER Energized like spring. 

00:42:15
 (inaudible ). 

00:42:18
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ). Lovely. 

00:42:25
 Relaxed and aware of everything around me. 

00:42:25
CAITLIN WALKER Relaxed and aware of everything around me. Thank you. What I'd like you to do is if you thought about why I invented the metaphor of a circle, so if you were to have this state anchored in some way so that you could get it down-- get it on when you wanted to, where would you keep it? 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:43:00
CAITLIN WALKER Was that on your circle? 

00:43:00
 Fix states. 

00:43:00
CAITLIN WALKER Have you gotten three separate ones? 

00:43:00
 Well, I'm asking at anywhere. 

00:43:05
CAITLIN WALKER That is, so how would you-- if you want to just trigger them? 

00:43:10
 Yeah. 

00:43:10
CAITLIN WALKER How would you, you say if I were-- I wanted you to keep the circle somewhere or keep the sense of it somewhere, how might you trigger them off? 

00:43:20
 Almost very specific to an activity. 

00:43:20
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm, yup. 

00:43:20
 That would have to be as I'm just about to do that activity. 

00:43:25
CAITLIN WALKER So what would remind you to - 

00:43:25
 Oh, I'll think about that. 

00:43:30
CAITLIN WALKER - to do it just before you do that activity? 

00:43:30
 (inaudible ). 

00:43:35
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm, okay. So, as that anchored to that activity, what's the different one? 

00:43:40
 Uhm, that, that they play in relax state. 

00:43:45
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. 

00:43:50
 Again, next to do breathing but it's a different breathing pace. (inaudible ) breaths. 

00:44:00
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so it's that sort? 

00:44:00
 Yup. 

00:44:00
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, and the third one? 

00:44:05
 And was there anything want the spring well. 

00:44:05
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. 

00:44:10
 And I guess it's like that cuz I did that. 

00:44:10
CAITLIN WALKER So what would-- how would you keep it or how would you remind yourself to set it off when you wanted it? 

00:44:15
 For the breathing, for doing that a-- as like the energy thing, uhm, to take breath out as I'm preparing to do the activity, breathing in for the relaxation. 

00:44:35
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Thank you. So are there (inaudible) people how, how might you keep it as a trigger? 

00:44:40
 (inaudible) specific phase of work and that's why (inaudible). It will wooosh! It's a bit like that stuff (inaudible) and when the danger (inaudible ). 

00:44:55
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

00:44:55
 But it's with turquoise, gold, black and white. 

00:45:00
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

00:45:00
 I'd stand up. 

00:45:00
CAITLIN WALKER With a little bit of that. 

00:45:05
 Yes. 

00:45:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

00:45:05
 (inaudible ) and keep it at the top of my head to-- so, it can just go hoooh! down. 

00:45:15
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm, lovely. 

00:45:15
 I have got a piece of music playing in my head so that's what I associate it with and so I need to keep that in my head. 

00:45:20
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. 

00:45:20
 And that's what you use to getting to it. 

00:45:25
CAITLIN WALKER So it's just that music? 

00:45:25
 Yeah. 

00:45:25
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:40
 Keep it in my feet, I think it's a deep breath in a while looking up, as well. 

00:45:40
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm, to keep in my feet, deep breath and looking up. 

00:45:45
 (inaudible ) associate it with the, the sign that (inaudible ) that they see negative emotion and bringing that, that negative emotion. It was kind of-- we, we'd practice doing a certain sound, ah, so I'd go back into a place, the science to down, the negative (inaudible ) in that so now, we place there's a (inaudible ) that thing is a concept. 

00:46:10
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

00:46:10
 To breathe from here really low, lower than normal. I want to be aware of, of, of sounds more than anything else. 

00:46:20
CAITLIN WALKER That's great. 

00:46:20
 It's the sounds that I breathe. 

00:46:25
Applications Circles of Excellence (modelling a usefull state) 

00:46:30
CAITLIN WALKER Circles of excellence isn't a training attention exercise and you'll notice it's different from some of the other modelling exercises. It comes from NLP. I'm not sure who actually was the first person to come with it, uhm, but it's used widely in that field. It could be useful if you have a remit for example that you have 30 people are suppose to be developing their confidence. So it's a way of deliberately taking them through an exercise, following a script, following a format and to get people to get one model that's different for each of them but the same model or a model. Uhm, it's not one that I use widely, however, it's simple, it follows a nice protocol and it's easy to use and lots of people enjoy it. So I really recommend that you just go and have a go of it, do it yourself a few times, uhm, try different states in it then go and practice it on some other people and then think where, where would this be useful. 

00:47:35
[music] 

00:47:40
CAITLIN WALKER Some of the applications that I've successfully used circles of excellence in, aha, I'm getting young people a classroom of young people to think about a really good exam state. So thinking about what we're gonna do is going to build an anchor for you to take into your exams to get you in to good state no matter what the ques-- what questions come up so that you can use your brain really successfully and you can start with confidence t hen building so what else, besides confidence what else would be a useful way for you to, to feel and be when you're going through an exam and they can build up this little anchor that they can then trigger and take into their exam with them. I think it would be fantastic for that. It can also be used if you want to somebody just got about driving tests or any conflict to a situation that you need to go into. Personally, I, I really use it in one to one or sma-- very small groups. There are much more likely to just use straightforward clean language modelling but as I said it'd be really useful to any large group that you want to build a positive state with. 

00:48:50
Background Clean Feedback 

00:48:55
CAITLIN WALKER Feedback is controversial issue in organizations, business, staff appraisals, teaching, coaching and I've-- I struggled for years to know just why it was so difficult and one of the reasons is, is because feedback is based on-- the feedback give us model of what's happening and it's not necessarily relevant to the person who is receiving feedback. Ah, what we were looking to do was when training attention is accompany with training together or if I want to give somebody else feedback I want you to learn as much about myself giving the feedback as they did and so, it was important to me to be able to, to, to tell what, what was it, what sense that I made of what they were doing that made me give them that feedback and as we were developing the water-flower model and we've really thinking a lot about what's presented and what's inferred and how to keep them separate, we decided to set of a feedback model that said here's someone that's working well and here's what was presented and here's my inference about that. And so, it lets the person who's receiving the feedback know she like to fit this-- I did first thing that she's describing and she liked it because of these things about her. Here's a thing that I did do that she's describing and she didn't like it because of these things here and it really keeps them safe. You can't say to somebody, ah, I really like that piece of work you did because you were so confident and I think go with me, oh, she thinks I'm confident but they don't know how to replicate that. If you say to them, when you came in to the room, you walk straight into the middle-- center of the room, welcome to everybody, sat down and there was no pause or anything before you started. And I like that because I've just seen that you were so confident and controlled and it allowed me to relax. And now they know what specifically they did or said that if they want you to relax again, they could do again and it really helps. So, there's two things that allows the receiver of the feedback to replicate it should they wished to and to understand what specifically it is about you, that means that, that you like thi-- this thing that they did. It's vital with the feedback model that the bit of what's presented, what you saw or heard is correct and that you use as close to sensory specific information as possible. Now let me be really clear about what that means. There's a big difference between sensory information so I-- you walk in a straight line, you sat down, you're back was straight, you looked at the audience in the eye. It's very sensory. You came in confidently either conceptual but it's not replicable. It's an idea but each of us as you know from the five sense has a difference sense of what that means. So it's-- in our view within training attention process, we really don't think it's very useful. So, be very clear sensory information for the per-- first bit then you can have your inference and your inference can be as personal as you like. So I can say, you know, I really liked it when you came in and sat down and you looked at me and you looked at the audience. I liked it because that means that you are completely in control and know all the answers to all the questions. I mean, that's probably bucking that, however, at least you now know that that's the belief I have when you behave like that. Seemly, I-- certainly, I didn't like was at, ah, when you wrote on the board you had about to the group and the person you see the feedback and think, "Did I happen about to the group and I wrote in the board?" Oh yeah, I did. It has to be verifiable, has to be true. He said, I didn't like it because that show to that do you think were all worthless. It is not your job if you're say feedback like that that go, "You know I don't. That's ridiculous." It's just your job to notice if I do this action, this person believes that. It has this impact and you just, you just know about them and say thank you very much and then what it was like differently when you write in the board, I would like you to, uhm, stand sideways to the group and let them know or say I just need to turn my back on you because I'm gonna write but I'll turn around and taught you in a minute. I'd like that because that would let me know that you still respect the group when you were doing something. It's very important with feedback that you don't, uhm, when you give feedback you don't expect the person necessarily to take it and when you receive feedback be interested in it. If you're not sure about something, ask a couple of clean questions but you don't have to justify your behavior or explain it, just notice it as a general rules about, ah, about giving and receiving it. The other thing to think about feedback is to consider why you're giving it to somebody and also to ensure that you go through all three bits. Some people really learn best if they're told what somebody likes. Some people really learn best or pay attention best if they're told what somebody doesn't like and it's good for you to be able to pay attention both to what's working and what's not working for yourself and somebody else. So go through all three bits. Keep the first bit really sensory specific. Think about why you're doing it and encourage people to give it to you. It's, uhm, such a useful way to find out about the people that you're working with, about what's important to them. The other thing to remember is somebody gives you feedback such as, you know, you got your back to the group and that means you think they're worthless. It doesn't mean you have to know-- always have your front to your group, that's just what that person things. But supposing I get the feedback, uhm, when you were training with us. You talk very quickly and I didn't like that because, uhm, I found it very difficult to understand you and let's say 20 people in a group of 30 give that feedback then I might need to start thinking about adjusting my behavior rather thinking, "Oh! That's just them." So the other thing about feedback is to really-- when you get repeated feedback is to think about whether maybe it's something that you'd like to adjust in yourself and have more flexibility about. 

00:55:35
Exercise Clean Feedback 

00:55:35
CAITLIN WALKER The clean feedback model allows you to spend some time thinking about what's working well for you, what's not working so well and what you'd like to have differently. So thinking about what you're learning so far, thinking about the DVD and the manual, what's one thing that's working really well for you And describe it as what you've seen or heard, something that you've seen or heard that's working really well for you so far is what? And it's working well for you because? Why is it working well for you? What's one thing that isn't working so well for you? Describe it, something that you're seeing or hearing that isn't working well for you and describe it in sensory specific language that means what are you seeing or hearing? And it's not work so well for you because what? Why isn't that working well for you? And what would you like different from that thing that isn't working well? So instead, you'd like to see and hear what? And why would that work better for you? That would work better for me because what? 

00:57:35
Applications Clean Feedback 

00:57:40
CAITLIN WALKER The clean feedback model, uhm, we use whenever we're training. So we use it, we give-- training partners give each to the feedback and we ask participants, clients, uhm, coaches to give us feedback on how we're doing. They can be a particularly useful model, uhm, in the schools and we've, we've (inaudible ) it in the school where we trained all the senior members of the staff, a number of the teachers and a number of the students in the model and those staff that are using it regularly said that one of the fun-- the best uses of it is if a kid comes in and then they're really stressed and angry and hyper, they can use the model to get the kid to distinguished between what they've seen and heard and the way they're reacting to it. And then just that it's not a challenge, it's not saying it's not true, that the student happen-- the kid comes up and says, "Arrgh! Miss, he was right in my face. He was so rude me." You say, "When he was so rude to me what-- and it be was right in your face, what did you see or hear him do that means he was so rude to you." Well, he came in and he came right up as he was right there. So he came in and he was right there and that means for you that he was right in your space and he was really rude to you, yeah. So what you'd prefer them to do? What you've like to have had happen? Well, not to be so rude. Yes, so what would you've seen and heard that would like you know he wasn't being so rude. Well, he would spoke to me from move there. So, he would spoke to you from over there and what would that meant to you. Well, it meant he wasn't like right, right in the space, Miss, okay. And it's, it's the certain beauty in it of just without saying anything you got a cue to understand that they've put two things and made them the same thing. Somebody stands close to you, it means that they're rude and it just slowly loosens the knot and teaches the philosophy that all of the stuff is about which is what's presented and the what you infer about are not the same thing and then it's asked to give you choice so that you can notice something happening and be interest and curious in it rather than have an inference about and then respond as though that's true without ever finding out maybe that's not what they meant. Maybe where-- they're not being lazy. Maybe this is the way they work at their best. So it just allows you to have an awful lot more choice and we advise to use it all over the place. 

01:00:00
Exercise How Do You Become? 

01:00:05
CAITLIN WALKER This exercise is an opportunity for you to explore your own temper. We call it how do you become because we use to call it how do you become angry and then we would ask some people, they don't become angry and some people become livid, some become stressed, some are cross, some are detached. So, putting whatever word suits the state that you get into and then use the form in your manual to answer some questions, to get a bit more information about the state and then, you'll need to get team up with somebody, you'll get into a small group and practice asking clean questions about it. When you are modelling temper, it's very important to remember sometimes you'll get a little bit of what's going on so if you may get, uhm, a bit of somebody being livid or you might get a bit of somebody crossed, so just welcome it. If it comes up it means you're doing a good job of modelling and you're getting a little of the, ah, of the experience that they're in. It can be useful not to stop with it but to start with something very positive. It can be useful as people get more familiar with one another and it's one of those exercises where unless you're a therapist or a very skilled clean language practitioner with some supervisors, uhm, and maybe a practice group that you've been working with so that you know your skills were-- are really good. It's best just to go through the phone, get a bit of information. Get people to map it and let them find that one information. It's not an exercise to go really deeply on if you don't have the skills to work through the issue with somebody. 

01:02:00
Applications How Do You Become? 

01:02:05
CAITLIN WALKER Applications for the how do you become exercise have been broad. It's started with this-- when I was working with disruptive teenagers but then we actually found it was really useful for working with people who work with disruptive teenagers because it was important for them to know how they became whatever they become in order for them to manage the state a lot better. We went from that to somebody saying can you do this with-- we've got advices that worked with long-term and employ it and some of the people who come in are really crossed and they want to be the-- and some of other advices than have difficulty managing their temper. So, we've used it with advices who worked with the long-term and employ it. Then, from there we've gone, "Oh, okay. That was really useful but actually now that we've done that, some of their managers wanted some help with their tempers and it's-- as the, as the exercise got known we've had all the sorts of, of, ah, specific discreet projects. So we've had a clever(ph) solicitors contact, it doesn't said we'd like some anger management when it's very stressful in the office. The solicitors tend to be very aggressive and unpleasant with the administrative staff and it's almost ending up in legal suits which was quite ironic and so we came in and we work with the whole, uhm, so-- soliciting team. It's okay, so when you're getting really stressed, they, they said, "Oh, we don't angry, we get stressed." So when you-- how do you become stressed? And they went through the form that you've got in your manuals and then, we came and then we did some modelling with, with them and we ask them questions so what would you need from your colleagues in order to keep your stress levels down or what can you do in order to manage your stress and they found that was very, very effective that they both went to the individual modelling but they did that in front of one another and it legitimize the feelings, allow them to express it, notice it in one another and then to really do support each other to keep calm. That was very successful, smaller project and then, you've like everything else. It can be used in business teams, it can be used in classrooms, it's very effective with, with students, uhm, and it could be great with families with in relationships and partnerships with the children in your family. So it's another of those exercises that it's maybe a little bit more sensitive in terms of you might get information that people-- that's quite sensitive. So we would, would ask you to get a little bit more acquainted with the clean questions before you use (inaudible ) use it but once your familiar with them, you can use it all over the place. 

01:04:45
Background Working At Your Best 

01:04:50
CAITLIN WALKER Working at your best exercise is one that is fundamental to the metaphors at work process, references to which you can find in your manual and it's a very common exercise for us to use in diversity training or in quick metaphor elicitation business training and it gives us a really nice starting point to think about so when if I'm-- if I know what I'm like when I work at my best. If I'm gonna start in a new project and then surely I and my boss would like me to work at my best, uhm, as much of the time as I can. Once you, ah, this level in the DVD of having done the basic exercises and gone through a different formats and hoping it's becoming obvious to you that learning at your best, working at your best, being really creative, making great decisions, all of these context or ideas can be put through these exercises. Once you have the basis of, of training attention processes, you can apply them to anything that your mind wants to. So, here we're doing working at your best. But if you've got a client or an organization that has real issues around decision making, you can do-- when you're making decisions really well you are like what? And then you can run it through the logical levels. So what environments allo-- allow you make decisions really well? What behaviors? What abilities? What values or identity? What's your identity? What's your purpose? Or you can take it through a clean start or you can use clean questions to built a model for you when you're making decisions really well. 

01:06:35
Exercise Working At Your Best When you're working at you're best. 1. When you're working at your best you're like what? 2. Draw or describe you working at your best on a sheet of paper. 3. Take it through the clean start. 4. Model with it using Clean Questions. 

01:06:40
CAITLIN WALKER As a final exercise, we'd like to give you the opportunity to develop a model for you when you're working at your best. To do this, go through the working at your best form in the manual. And think when you're working at your best you're like what? And draw or describe you working at your best on a sheet of paper. Take it through the clean start. And then, get something to do some modelling with it using clean questions. 

01:07:15
Applications Working At Your Best 

01:07:20
CAITLIN WALKER Some case studies for the working at your best exercise, uhm, I-- when my first pieces of business-- oh, excuse me, if we got Tom(ph) and Caitlin, is that only the... 

01:07:35
 Tom(ph) and Caitlin. What's that? 

01:07:35
CAITLIN WALKER Ah, it's a story about me and Tom(ph) where he doesn't like me coming to work then he wants to like a blueprints and I wanted like, ah-- I'm sure we've got a footage of it. 

01:07:45
 Okay. (inaudible ). 

01:07:50
CAITLIN WALKER I'll go in to nap and Tom(ph) comes in and says, "Right, you've got five minutes to explain this process to me." And, uhm, if I like it I'm gonna come and If I don't, I don't-- I won't come. 

01:08:05
 Ah, can you do it? 

01:08:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. I'll do it. I'm sorry. So, working at your best applications. 

01:08:10
 Okay. 

01:08:10
CAITLIN WALKER Ah, the transition I made between being a youth worker and a studier of linguistics into business applications came from an organization that wanted me to develop, uhm, a group metaphor for the whole company and some of the exercises in this DVD, uhm, first made-- they also made the transition from-- from kids to adults as I made that transition myself. And, ah, one of the first times I got an opportunity to use this, I arrived at the company, we decided what we're going to do, we're going to do when you work at your best, you're like what? An ideal project for you is like what? A team that supports you to work at, at your best is like what? We're gonna get all those individual metaphors out and then we're gonna get one joined metaphor for the company itself that they will then use to evolve and grow. Great idea. I arrived there and somebody walks up to me and says, "Well, I've heard this project is gonna go ahead. I don't who you are. I don't know if I want to be involve. You got five minutes to explain it to me," and just as we've had to in this DVD, you're trying to explain experiential systemic process in five minutes. It's really difficult so I think, "Oh! I'll just do some of this, okay," so, when you're working at your best, uhm, and then if this project were working really well, it allows you to work at your best. This project will be like what? And this is not what you're talking about. I think, "Okay." So when I'm working at my best, it's like I'm, I'm on a boat and if this project were working really, really well for me, this project will be like white water rafting. It'll be-- all and something together. We're going somewhere we haven't been before, it's a new river, it's exciting. We're not-- we got to accommodate each other’s weights, each others skills but we've all got to work together. It-- sometimes it's quite gentle. We can reflect to where we've been but sometimes it's really hectic and I could see him as (inaudible ). Uh! And he said, "Great! That's as much as I need to know. I wouldn't want to go, go in this project with you." I go, "Okay." So, knowing that and I have heard my metaphor, if this project were successful and you would go in it, the project would have to be like what? Well, for me to be really engaged in a project, it's got to be like a perfect building, a perfect building. It's gotta be perfect blueprints and neat and they got to look beautiful. In each stage of the design from blueprint to building it, each stage of the design has to look fantastic and then, the building has to look good no matter where you stand in it, outside from the inside and like, Oh! and "I'm fitting (inaudible ) myself good and I can see why wouldn't work for me. I would wanna work with him. So I said, "Okay." Now, we got these two metaphors, what have to be true about my project supposing you have to work with me. What have to be true about my metaphor of my project for you to want to work with me. You said, "Well, that have to be some kind of like cartography or checking where we're going, some kind of mapping." I'll have to be some-- doing something like that for me to stay interested. I said, "Okay. You-- it's all right. You can do that." It can be your job to map the territory, find out where we've gone. Decide where we're gonna go next which tribute you, we're gonna follow. Yeah, I think that would help as it is to go with yours. Could I-- could we do it, in, in pencil. Could I rub it out as we go along. I said, "If new information comes up, we could rub it out and start again." He said, "Oh, yeah," he said, "they don't have to be written in pen." So, there's plenty of flexibility as long as at each stage it's beautiful. Ah! I said, "Okay, I gotta ease it." (inaudible ) would just annoy me and I've, I just sabotage what we were doing. He said, "But this process is about like trying to find that how we can still get what we want and work together." I said, "Yep." Yeah, I said, "I'll come." Like, okay, and in that I start to really believe in the process, I was delivering myself which was okay. What this is about-- this is about knowing who you are and what you need and then, what do you have was the minimum, you have to adjust either to work at your best in this project or you work at your best with those people and so, this has then become a tool of self-knowledge and then because we do it in small groups, it's a tool for group knowledge so that it then go what's the least we'd have to do to work better as a system and it can be applied in diversity training. It can be applied in recruitment processes. It can be reapplied-- applied in teams. It can be applied where there's conflict. It can be applied at schools. All over the place and one of the loveliest ways to do is just to think about your work. If you're independent then, what clients you take on? If you're in a job just think when you're working at your best, you're like what and then go, okay, how can I be at my best more of the time and do I need to change jobs to-- can I easily shift my work environment that are-- so that it allows me to really enjoy the workplace more. Use a fundamental for training attention has been, how can more people enjoy themselves and be fulfilled at work more of the time with least negative impact on other people on the environment or in the communities? So, knowing at the very starting point, knowing when you're working at your best, you are like what? We think it's a great place to start.

Background Modelling Time 

01:13:55
CAITLIN WALKER Modeling time is an exercise that can be useful just to demonstrate to a group that they have different ways of organizing, thinking and time. It can just-- it, it-- they can throw up so many differences between people. It's a very useful illustrator. We've used each in lots of contexts and you can just go into it a little bit, just for the fun of it to demonstrate it, it can-- you can only go-- you don't even need to draw it out. You could just say think about the past, whereabouts is it. If you had to point to the past, where is it? Get people to point and you'll have some people pointing here, some here, some will say it's there and you just look around, notice the differences. Then, you'll say think about the future, what happens in a week, a month, a year from now, where is the future. And some people say it's here, people will say it's there and just look around. So you can do it very lightly, very quickly, whereabouts this now and it's amazing. Some people will say, "Well, it's just me." You say, "Well, I can see the look in your face, look at somebody else. Whereabouts this now? Oh, it's there." So, what's between you and now. Oh well, it's like that's my timeline and that's the past and that's the future and that's now but I always-- I'm never on my own timeline like I'm always watching it. And thank goodness, look at that person, organize, compare it to you. So, it gonna-- it's a really nice start-- starting point to go how differently organized are you from other people. One of the things to remember with it is like all of these exercises if you're facilitating it, it's absolutely not your job to go, "Oh!" if somebody's organized it differently to what you expected. It's your job to be curious, interested and respectful to think about them-- the middle section of the word flower(ph) and to encourage that behavior in other-- with other people. So, for example, if somebody has the past here and the future there, it's not your job to go, "Hmm. Well, it doesn't look like a good place to keep your past. I wonder..." You have no idea why it's organized like that. Just be interest, you go, "So the past is here and the future is there." Ask them a couple of clean questions. Find out a bit more about that future, future, a bit more about the past and if you want to come more deeply into the exercise, if it's appropriate for the context you're in, then, you may say, "So, what are some of the differences for you having a past here? Do you think than pursuing so who's got the past over here or the past." Somebody might even say, "Oh, my past, it’s just a black hole. As soon as it's in the past I never think about it again." And I guess it's not your job to go, "Whoa! I wonder why that-- it's-- that's not a very good idea but..." cuz you just don't know. It might be the best idea in the world and I'll tell you what. If you're not like that, they will be able to do something with the way they think about the time that's not available to you. So with all these exercises, it's not about judgment, it's just about curiosity. Let them notice or learn about their own systems but it's not for you to do it. Just enjoy it, find out it's modelling, found out what they like, be interested. Who's not like you? Who is like you? What are some benefits or limitations to the way you organize time and then let it go. 

01:17:25
Exercise Modelling Time 

01:17:30
CAITLIN WALKER Thinking about something that happened yesterday. Thinking about last week. Two weeks ago. A month. Six months. A year. Five years. Ten. When you were little. His fault. (inaudible ) when you were little. Oh, I wouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Five years or 10, 10. Where you begin? Thinking about the past? Whereabouts is it? Does it have a direction? Size or a shape? What kind of past is it? Thinking about tomorrow. Next week. A month. Two months from now. The next year. Five years. Ten. 

01:19:25
[sil.] 

01:19:30
CAITLIN WALKER Thinking about the future. Whereabouts is the future? Doesn't have a size or a shape? What kind of future is it? And thinking about now, where is now? Does now have a size or a shape? Take some paper and pens and make a map of your past, your present and your future. 

01:20:10
Applications Modelling Time 

01:20:10
CAITLIN WALKER The modelling time exercise can be used in any kind of training. It can be use at the set of a project and business meetings so that you can get people to model past, present, future and then say, "So, when this project is completed whereabouts is your sense of it being completed? If some people-- it's, oh, it's over there because one month is by that wall, the chances are their attentions is gonna be very different from somebody who says it's completed here, we've got a very serious-- rigorous series of steps that we have to go to, to get it and you can also just rather than saying when the project is completed, you can just say, "And as I notice, where is your attention?" Some people's attention will always be on before something happens. Some people's attention will always be on it happening or after it happens, the consequences. So it'll be a lovely exercise for just getting a group to think about the way that they're thinking about something before you then launch into developing a project together and who's gonna do what practically. Uhm, another area that we found very successful was working with long-term and employ it. So we setup these courses which are, uhm, very much just modelling courses, the idea being that it's not our job to say where the people should or shouldn't get particular jobs but if we just setup the five senses, learning at your best, uhm, how you organize time that would go on to go on what, what are you good at, what aren't you good at, what do you want have happened, setting out comes in future but the time things been really, really interesting because for those people who don't-- who aren't in work because they don't organize time, they get to explore how they do then, how they do it in relation to each other without any judgment, without any pushing. It's just interesting. So I have had somebody where they said, "Oh, my past is here. It's, it's like a brick wall and nobody else in the room is like that. This is whereabouts your future." He said, well, it's, it's in front of it but I can never see it and it is not a therapeutic, uhm, environment. It's not my job to help rearrange his past. I, I have been invite to but just noticing that he said, "You know, all I ever see is how I'm gonna fail and then the next day he was (inaudible ) exercising, setting an outcome, he said, I want to put that behind me so I can see my future and now we've got-- when we went through that exercise with him, the whole thing was different. Whereas before that, he had been-- he'd been trying, ever been trying to help and get work without any real understanding of how it wasn't happening. So it can be and that's very practical exercise, uhm, said it was a business, business applications helping people to find the work they want, they can use it-- we use it a lot with, with students if they want to set outcomes in the future for their learning and, and I read that I've loved this in is with people where they're ill or they're recovering from something to set goals or find an area in their future where they're not going to be in pain or where they're-- uhm, when they'll be out of something that's happening to them and that can be quite uninteresting. If somebody is, for example, has got oh, I see this stretching out throughout the whole of my life, uhm, and that, that if they not-- the, the way that they're thinking about their illness can then affect their ability or their body's ability to stop it because they've already got that as an habitual thing and so using that to get into notice how are they thinking about their illness, when might it stop, when, when, uhm, how long do they want it. Ah, and that can be very useful for just getting people to actually set, uhm, much more holistic goals for themselves where there's actually, I mean, paying now but I think it'll probably stop, it will take me about six months, these are the exercises I'm gonna do and rather than, uhm, somebody that I've been working within, ah, in physiotherapy. She said it's, it's been very, very useful for saying, "Okay, we're gonna do these exercises and then that will allow the pain to decrease by then," rather than they do the exercises for month nothing happens and they just see the pain continuing forever, so what's the point? So, it can be very useful to just organizing people's thinking about time, goals and outcomes. 

01:24:40
Background Modelling An Outcome 

01:24:40
CAITLIN WALKER Modeling an outcome is very much just about that. It's about finding out what somebody would like to have happen and then, rather than talking about modelling a problem, it's about going to what is it they want to have happen and what will that be like, what will it feel like, what will it sound like, what will the world be like when they have what they want. Ah, sometimes when you're modelling an outcome, you'll get the information about why they don't have it. If you think about an outcome, I didn't make an-- I didn't have an outcome to get my breakfast this morning, it's just something as a, an habitual part of my daily life. However, I might need to s-- set or certainly in my past, I had to set an outcome to find the close(ph) that suited me that went together, wasn't part of my natural make-up. I could see in the world that other people could do this skill but I didn't have it. So, I set an outcome, I went through the well-formed outcome formula and then I use the clean language question as facilitators to help me develop my outcome. It allows really clear about what I wanted and then what were the steps I had to go through in order to get what I wanted. So, there are lots of different reasons people have outcomes. Sometimes, it's because it's just something they haven't learned yet like an outcome to speak fluent Spanish and all else that happens after you learned it and then maybe it-- I need to make the time to learn it and as you go through modelling an outcome, you may find actually, there's a different outcome behind this, maybe this is about finding time to makes-- make something important to happen for me. Sometimes, people have outcomes because they think they ought to do it. So sometimes you'll be working with somebody an outcome and they got "Actually, I don't want this. My family want me to do it. My friends think I want to do it but actually I re-- really don't want to." So sometimes you'll find when you model an outcome that kind of information will come up. Sometimes, something is an outcome rather than just habitual because somebody wants it but actually they're not doing the things that they-- these are-- they're working very hard but then are not doing the things that will get them it. So, for example, I spent a lot of time really having to work hard at watching my weight and then, when I have my first child she is-- she has gluten allergy so because she has gluten allergy we don't have any bread and any wheat in the house. And then finally if you don't have any wheat in the house you also don't have any biscuits or cakes. And so, suddenly-- oh, not suddenly but over time, weights start to disappear of me until I dropped down to a natural 9½ stone which I can only maintain if I don't eat wheat and sugar. But I didn't know that before so I spent a lot of time exercising and dieting and, and working on it. Now, I don't have to do anything-- any of that at all. Don't eat wheat and sugar, eat what I like otherwise and I'm absolutely fine. So, sometimes the outcome can be that there's something happening so that even though you're working hard, there's something that you're not aware of, outside of your awareness, it's just stopping you getting it. As you do clean language modeling, it's not your job as a facilitator to think of answers or to help, or to advice. It's just your job to stay curious, stay interested and help them develop their model until the new information comes to their system. It's their systems that's setting the outcome, it's their system that has as an outcome and not just a habit, and isn't in their system that the information is. So, there's this a really important time to remember the wisdom is gonna come from them not from you. It's just your job to stay curious, it's not your job to help in terms of giving advice. It is your job to create the conditions where they can find the information. 

01:28:45
Exercise Modelling An Outcome 

01:28:45
CAITLIN WALKER In order to model an outcome, ah, it's-- this is not an exercise that I can just talk you through because I need to have your answers in order to ask the next clean questions. It's very much about using questions to help you get come to really under-- good understanding of what it is that you would like to have happen. So, what I'd like you to do is to use the form in your, in your manual for getting a well-formed outcome that's, uhm, an exercise that comes from NLP. Once you've gone through that form then I'd like you to go when I've got what I want, it'll be like what? What is it you like to have happen? And as you answer that question then draw right to describe that answer on a piece of paper and you're ready to go into the next exercise of the clean start. 

01:29:45
Applications Modelling An Outcome 

01:29:50
CAITLIN WALKER The applications for modelling outcomes, ah, only limited by what it is that you'd like to have happen. Anything that you'd like to have happen. You can answer the question and have somebody ask a few clean questions about it and you'll find out more about what it is that you'd like to have happen and then they can help you to build up the steps. They will allow it to happen or they might help you to-- as you get more information to go actually, "I want something slightly different now." And it's been used really successfully in one to one business coaching, the fantastic area for it and one to one life coaching. So, what you would like to have happen? I would like to be debt-free in five years. Or what you would like to have happen? I would like to own my own home and do a little bit modelling and it go actually. No, what I really want is I want to be independent and I felt originally that owning my own home would allow that but that's not what I really want. I really want to feel independent and that's what I'm going to model. So modelling outcomes can be personal. It can be professional. It can be use in staff appraisals. So, in setting goals for the next six months, the next year, it can be used in learning. It can be used with students. It can be used with children. It can be very interesting getting children to start developing short-term outcomes and then longer-term outcomes through the school time. Uhm, it can be done jointly. So, for example, if my husband deny our planning to buy a house, we may use the joint outcome model, uhm, along with the, ah, the, the clean setup that we did at the start of the DVD. We might do a clean set, uhm, and then really explore our outcomes for what it is what we'd like to have happen and to make sure that we're on the same route and we're not, ah, we're not gonna sabotage each other's attempts and it can be used in teams, so you can get individuals, a number of individuals to model a joint outcomes and then say, "Okay, so now that we've got this, how we're going to get something that were all happy with across the whole group?" So, a lo-- endless opportunities from modelling outcomes. Uhm, we really just encourage you to try it, uhm, whenever you got the opportunity. 

01:32:15
Exercise General Modelling Time Learning at your best Modelling an outcome General Modelling You can model anything. 

01:32:20
CAITLIN WALKER General modelling. Now we've talked about time, we've talked about learning at your best, we've talked about mode an outcome. One of the other things to remember is you can model anything and any repeated pattern that you've got could be interesting to model. So what I'd like you to think about is something that you, that you do that you'd like to find out more about. It could be that you'd particularly good at putting together an excellent outfit and looking good before you go out in the morning. It could be I'm really good at not be able to tell left and right. It could be I can't spell and at which I'll be ask you to think all right so when you're not spelling, it's like what? So I'd like you to choose something that you'd like to find out more about and when you've chosen it then put that thing, write it down, draw it, find some way of representing it and then, get somebody to ask you clean questions about it to help you find about-- out more about how is it that you do that thing and-- cuz this the start of learning to model anything. 

01:33:45
Applications General Modelling 

01:33:50
CAITLIN WALKER When I first started in this field, I started training in NLP and NLP was very much an outcome focused discipline. It was very much about how do you get what you want. Uhm, you need to think about outcomes rather problems and it was baffled(ph) me a little bit because I thought lots of problems were actually quite amazing. So when I started in this field I'd started going okay, how do you what you do even if what you do isn't want you like? So modelling for me can be about an outcome. It can be about a problem. It can be about something that you really bad at or something that you're really good at as long as you, as long as it's repeatable, it's actually something interesting to find out about. So although, I think there's lots of, uhm, times when modelling an outcome is just the right thing to do, I also think there are sometimes or times which modelling anything is just-- it helps you find out about yourself if you're being modeled or helps you find out about other people if you're modelling them. Uhm, so I do encourage you as you learn clean language skills to go and take anything that somebody is willing to let you play around within practice on. If somebody can't spell find out how they can't spell. Don't try to change it, just go find that how they can't do it and sometimes simply understanding the structure of it will make things change. If somebody loses their temper, in fact, we got an exercise specifically for that but go find out. What-- if they lose it like that, hmm, that's completely different from if you use it like, that took longer for start. Just go and find out how does it work. We really encourage you, in this program, just to be curious. How do people do what people do? So sometimes when we are working, we might be called in not just to find out how an individual does something but let's say in this organization, 90% of meetings, 90% of the time spend in meetings is unproductive. Well, that's an awful lot waste of time. I might be interesting just go and finding out how does that work? What's the structure of how they waste that time? Before I even think about what it might like to have instead. And sometimes that could be really, really interesting. 

01:36:20
Background Clean Questions 

01:36:20
CAITLIN WALKER When I first came across clean questions because I wasn't necessarily a psychotherapist and like-- it does not the kind of people as practicing on-- it on. I just use the other sorts of things. I'd go, "Hmm. Oh! My wrist hurts I wonder if you can use modelling on that. So, people-- I'd get a bunch of people to ask me some clean questions. Let's say, what you like to have happen and let's say, we'd like to find out more about the burning and I say when you'd like to find out more about the burning, what kind of burning is it?" "Oh, it's sharp and deep and it's sharp and deep. Sharp and deep like what?" Like a crevice and we just modeled the pain in my wrist and remarkably it eased, did a bit more modelling at a different session and it went all together. And I, oh, that was interesting. Didn't know that was gonna happen. What would else you can use this on? Somebody said, "Can you use it to some back pain? I said, "I don't know. Who here has got back pain, right? Evan(ph) has got back pain over here. Let's find out the structure to the back pain." Spend a lot of time modelling it. "Oh! It's like a claw in my, in my spine that's just set." "Ah! What kind of claw is that claw?" "Oh, like-- it's like a, it's like a hand but it's become really set in, set in stone." "Ah, when it's really set in stone, what kind of hand was that hand before it was set in stone?" "Oh, it's a hand." "What kind of hand?" "It was a supporting hand." "Is there anything else about the supporting of that hand?" "Oh, it was relentless." Oh, do you know what? It's just reminded me and suddenly you'd have people who had chronic back pain being reminded of an over supportive hand from a childhood that actually made them feel that they would never be able to manage on their own and all of that information's coming to this chronic back injury at all, that's interesting. You can model a problem, get more information, a system starts and knowledge starts to emerge out of the system, new things happen. So okay, well, let's find other things, uhm, can you use it on time? That's sort model of time and you go, you can and lots of interesting things happen when you do it. And then, we have the time exercise. You go, "Okay, can you model anger?" Yes, you can. What happens, the more information the system has, the better choices it has, the less it's (inaudible ) the more it can run its own models. So when you're learning modelling, it's-- you, you can do it on anything. I really encourage you in your applications to just go, what are you interested in? Go model it. Go use clean questions to find out more information and then, go what shall I do next and when you've visit the website and you look at all the different case studies and current projects or you visit other clean web-- clean angered websites and go look at what these people are doing and one of the things I'd really like to emphasize here is if you have an area of interest that no one's used in clean questions or modelling in, be the first, be the leader in your field, it may well be that no one was doing it because there aren't that many people doing this process yet. You may well be the leader in your field. 

01:39:40
Background Clean Start David Grove (originator of Clean Language) e-mail: caitlin@trainingattention.co.uk 

01:39:45
CAITLIN WALKER Clean start exercise has just been shared with me by David Grove and I've-- it's a lovely amalgamation between clean language which we're studying in this DVD, clean space which would be a separate course and, and emergent knowledge which is another field that's just developing and the idea is to use space. People don't just think in their heads, so they think out in space. They think around them, lots of people will look away to get information, uhm, or you might need to get up and say, I need a fresh perspective so we all know that we use space to think in and this exercise is really about absolutely letting the outcome or the idea, the thing that you want to explore and the person to just allow space to be operated in the room and to find out if there's any new information just about that. The way I'd advise you to run it is just have a goal. If you see-- if you notice the people in the DVD, in the footage, sometimes there's loads of new information. Sometimes there isn't. Have a go with it. Stay curious. Stay respectful and just notice what happens and when at few times different people and notice how differently people do it. Occasionally, you have somebody who that says, it's that at the right-- it's that in the right space, and I'll go, no and I'll get up and they'll move the thing and I'll come back again and you'll see. You have to start again and is that in the right space? Yes. And are you in the right space? No. And they'll move themselves and then they'll go back at the beginning, can you just say, "Is that in the right space?" "No." And sometimes you can find the whole session will just go on this and although it may seemed that they just move a bit around, each move will update new information, they're thinking about it differently, they're finding new perspectives, they're picking up new information. So, just keep running to the process until you get a congruent yes to all answers on the list. Clean start applications. When I first saw the clean start I thought, "Oh, it's a bit unusual. I don't think I'll be able to do this at work. I could only do this in therapy session so maybe one to one coaching." But I've got to say as I've become more confident using it, I do use it in one to one coaching. I do use it a lot in therapy. However, I also can use it in, in business project development so thinking about what you'd like to have happen, when the project is working really well, it'll be like what? Represent that on a piece of paper. Now, go and put it somewhere in space and yourself in relation to it. Work with three or four different people working on the same project. Look at the differences and perspective and dynamic. What happens between now and there? And they don't think anything of it and I think "Oh, I don't know why I used to be so nervous about it." So, really with an exercise like this, develop your confidence. Make sure that you're not worried about it and then just go and practice it whatever you feel like it in project management meetings, in one to one with small groups, who knows, hopefully people will have a ideas of a-- an exercise like this that I've never thought of and if you do we really encourage you to e-mail us. Let us know where you're using it, how you're using it successfully and share the ideas with other people.

Clean Language & Systemic Modelling Workshop Introduction 

01:44:25
 (inaudible ) I want to know like how will you get to start the story. 

01:44:40
Caitlin Walker 

01:44:50
CAITLIN WALKER We've been rounding up please(ph) until 19 and no matter it was in the business and she put it for business training course and somebody couldn't make it and they couldn't get a refund so she called me and said (inaudible ) up so, I kind of accidently fell into NLP quite, quite young but there was something that I didn't like about it and I realized now, not (inaudible ) the whole subject but that where I was being trained at that time. I realize now it had been, NLP was a modelling process to model many therapists, change techniques, take them out of there and apply them to people and what I was finding were lots of people are getting a very good techniques to change other people's minds but that also must change it didn't stick and often those changes are quite manipulative. I find there was a lot of manipulation and a lot of, ah, I'd be around by very clever people people who'd go, ah, da-da-dan, before you knew it. You think I've just agreed to whole of stuff and I don't know how they did that and I just didn't-- I didn't actually feel very safe. There's a lot of people are very good at it and there was another part of it which was about ecology. So I'd think I will-- I often work with quite violent kids and I think the thing is if that kids dissociated and that dissociation is causing him problems, how do I know that that's not the safest place for him to be given what's going on from that home? Uhm, what would I be doing re-associating even though I know how to do that if that's not actually in his interests? So, I was always stock with this dilemma of I had all the skills but I didn't know where (inaudible ) apply them and when I saw David Grove working in 1996 maybe. He's, ah, Māori psychotherapist from New Zealand. I saw David working and when I saw clean language at work, I thought that's the missing bit. He doesn't influence or change the client. He simply asks the questions while the client builds up a model of what they're like and once the client got to a certain level of information, they could update their own-- you could see them in a moment, reorganizing it and there's something about the way they would do it. That was inherently beautiful and sensible to the way they built up their model and I thought that's it. So I took it off him, learn it from him and then said, "All right, this is so useful. All right, kids, come on here. Who here can spell? Let's find how you do it. Who here loses the temper? That's it. Let's find how you do it and let's just get the models." No idea of changing them. Let's just get self-awareness in modelling and then kids would start to go on this. Can you, can you do that stuff you did but can you do it must, so I do it. Who here can spell? Oh, so who here can add up two and two? Who here like this get you together, let's find out how you do it? Three and four, this I can see it is three plus four equals seven. All right, who doesn't (inaudible ) what happens. We'll I, I got it in my fingers. So, what did you do? I do one, two, three, one, two, three, four and then, and then I count them one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So it wasn't different. He's doing the way, he's doing the way, he's doing it. (inaudible ). Oh, that's okay, dismiss. All right, yeah. So it cannot-- I didn't have to teach them anything I could just fiddle, get them to know how each of them are organized and then they just shift and it was sort of (inaudible ) from not to see the management trainings. Yeah, it's the same stuff but it's just how you make brilliant decisions on the stock market. It's just--- you just need a different a model and then, once you know more about it you can replicate it. So that was the-- and it was a non-intervention thing rather than trying to change them and just go in what you like. 

01:48:30
 Really? 

01:48:35
Clean Setup 

01:48:40
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so, we're gonna start with, uhm, actually I'm gonna, I'm gonna get you to spend, uhm, just two minutes setting an outcome or state for today and the next two days. Just because I think it can be useful and those of you like to write you could write a stand, you can just note it in your head. For this couple of days, it's be really useful for you, in fact, at the four days all together but for this, this training for be really useful for you, it will be like what? Now, couple of examples. 

01:49:15
 Fun. 

01:49:15
CAITLIN WALKER What kind of fun? 

01:49:20
 Uhm, having a laugh. 

01:49:25
CAITLIN WALKER It will be fun having a laugh. Lovely. Who's gonna be different to that? 

01:49:30
 Interactive. 

01:49:35
CAITLIN WALKER So interactive. What kind of interactive? 

01:49:35
 Uhm, a lots of communication with each other and, ah, different (inaudible ) styles and so, not a varied diet. 

01:49:45
CAITLIN WALKER So, interactive like a varied diet. 

01:49:50
 Uh-hmm. 

01:49:50
CAITLIN WALKER Great. Who's different to that? 

01:49:50
 (inaudible ). 

01:49:53
 It can be (inaudible ) or not. It's entirely up to you. 

01:49:55
 (inaudible ), ah, like playing with friends. 

01:50:00
CAITLIN WALKER Like playing with friends. 

01:50:00
 Yup. 

01:50:05
CAITLIN WALKER Anything else about those friends? 

01:50:05
 Ah, ah, nobody will friends who is nice to be with and that playing isn't just full-blown playing. It's (inaudible ) creative and some thing's coming out of it (inaudible ). 

01:50:20
CAITLIN WALKER Fun, creative some things is going out of it playing with friends. Who's different to that? 

01:50:25
 I'd like to think that extra tools be united into my tool bag which should gonna be useful and sharp or organized or something like that. 

01:50:35
CAITLIN WALKER So useful sharp, organized tools in your tool bag. So before there's extra tools in your tools bag, what kind of tool bag is it now? 

01:50:45
 So, it's a big tool bag and there's no bottom in it. So, it's endless I can keep with it in there. 

01:50:55
 My tool bag is completely different to that. 

01:50:55
 Like the bottom was picked. 

01:50:55
CAITLIN WALKER So you also-- you've got-- it's no end to it, you can keep putting tools in it. So, when you keep putting tools in it and then you get new sharp tools in your tool bag and it's organized then what happens? 

01:51:10
 The problem for me is I forget about the tools on my bag and I focused on the ones that are at the top. 

01:51:15
CAITLIN WALKER So, so for this to be really useful training for you, then what happens? It will be like what? 

01:51:25
 Should be able to put them in order and not forget about the ones that I've got at the bottom. 

01:51:30
CAITLIN WALKER Great, okay. So did you notice that this thing that-- may know how I may back and support him to relate in this to and if you, if you got que-- if he's got questions now about other things that you know, how is it related. It can be important first to or maybe for all us to helping thing-- that how that's organize in relation to those. Who's different to that? 

01:51:50
 (inaudible ) making new connection with people and -- 

01:51:55
CAITLIN WALKER So making new connections with people. So, anything else about those new connections? 

01:52:00
 (inaudible ) connections and then learning from each other and learning about new applications of using clean language. That's cool. 

01:52:15
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so (inaudible ) new applications of clean language metaphor. Lovely. Who's different again? 

01:52:20
 (inaudible ) rather than just (inaudible ) so I can click into it anytime I wanted to. 

01:52:30
CAITLIN WALKER So, and what kind of times that could be times when you want to click into those tools after the training? 

01:52:35
 Uhm, I'm not sure yet. I don't know. 

01:52:40
CAITLIN WALKER And who's different again? 

01:52:45
 And mine is (inaudible ) missing gap. Feel like I'm missing something it means (inaudible ) I'm hoping that, that this is what or (inaudible ). 

01:52:55
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so missing gap. What lets you know that there's a missing gap? 

01:53:05
 Uhm, that I don't-- I'm not seeing it as much a result for this is what I like, like I don't feel as, uhm, (inaudible ). 

01:53:18
CAITLIN WALKER As you say, you can-- and we're already starting, this is part of it so if you just, if you actually set to that, so she's trying to find how to articulate it to us. We can check where she's got the information before she answers. So it was, ah, that kind of gap. Okay, who's different again? 

01:53:35
 I'm making connections with things that are already within me. So it's allowing things to flow right through me, uhm, I'd associate to, to, to observe, ah, and things connect inside. 

01:53:50
CAITLIN WALKER So to allow things to through-- flow right through you and to allow things to connect inside. 

01:53:55
 It's a very conscious process but it's quite associated. 

01:53:55
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. Lovely. Thank you. 

01:54:00
 One will be spacey. 

01:54:05
CAITLIN WALKER Spacey. So for this training to be really for use-- useful for you, it will be spacey. So, with spacey, does that spacey have a size or a shape? 

01:54:15
 Well, free. It's free. 

01:54:15
CAITLIN WALKER Is there anything else about that free? 

01:54:20
 It's creative. 

01:54:20
CAITLIN WALKER So free, creative, spacey. 

01:54:25
 It's safe. 

01:54:25
CAITLIN WALKER Great. Aha! And when it safe where does the safe come from? 

01:54:35
 Any. 

01:54:35
CAITLIN WALKER Again, one of things we can say is there anything where I could do to support you or anything that we could do to support you for that safe? 

01:54:45
 It (inaudible ). 

01:54:47
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, and right now, we'll do it, we'll do it as quite as quickly because where gonna go with the first exercise. But certainly, supposing we're in a business training, one that you go-- a training were we got a lot of time together, it's gonna be quite important to suppose in someone I've got project together. For me, it's actually and I could do also the strategies for what, what would I do that would stop at being space, what could I do that would help it to be spacey? Yeah, we can start to in a workout for them train together what would we have to do to, to build that relationship. What about you? 

01:55:20
 I thought it almost concern but it's a little bit in conflict with (inaudible ). It's just like, uhm, well it you know, this really-- they can (inaudible ) when he roll in our rooms when decorating and that's got me (inaudible ) and it's very simple to use. It's not about (inaudible ) what do incredibly transformational. So, it's (inaudible ) I guess as opposed to... 

01:55:45
CAITLIN WALKER So for this to be-- this trend to be really useful for you. What will happen to that, that box with those incredibly transformational tools? 

01:55:50
 Well, that tools but it seem to (inaudible ), isn't it? In terms of transformations (inaudible ) - 

01:55:58
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-huh. 

01:55:58
 - (inaudible ). 

01:56:00
CAITLIN WALKER Right. Great. Okay, so you have seen enough of his bag, you can have yours. 

01:56:05
 Well, I was looking over here and I was thinking my desktop. It's a (inaudible ). So the files are everywhere and I forget where the things are. So, that's part of the picture of what I'm doing. 

01:56:15
CAITLIN WALKER As Crystal(ph) say the power of metaphor is when you start to get some decent once you go, "Oh, and they do it here, and they do it here and they do it here." And so, as metaphors-- cuz a little bit this is not about change so much, it's about modeling. As metaphors evolve, it can take care of huge sweeps. 

01:56:35
 Cuz I won't delete anything on (inaudible ). Cuz I know it will be useful (inaudible ) endless amounts of notes, and materials and things that are countless or the (inaudible ) I don't forget over that. 

01:56:45
CAITLIN WALKER Well, so the more you've-- we, we work hard a bit about this organize when later on will-- we're modelling something that you wanted to have different. If you want to model that as you look at the organize that you want these tools to be and like (inaudible ) that it affects your desktop. Lovely, okay, and then just this-- just for you to think, for you to get the most out of this wee-- this training you'll be like what? 

01:57:15
[sil.] 

01:57:20
 Open. 

01:57:20
CAITLIN WALKER Open, Uh-hmm. 

01:57:25
 I'll be a five-year-old pristine child. 

01:57:30
CAITLIN WALKER Great. 

01:57:30
 I'll be, uhm, a (inaudible ) that's full of (inaudible ). 

01:57:35
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

01:57:35
 And I'm (inaudible ). Focused and calm. 

01:57:45
CAITLIN WALKER So focused and calm, a field, a five-year old pristine child, open, open. 

01:57:50
 I'll be receptive and interactive. 

01:57:55
CAITLIN WALKER Receptive and interactive. 

01:58:00
 Uhm, like a sponge (inaudible). 

01:58:00
CAITLIN WALKER Again if you notice this-- I'll be like a sponge so you can-- people often answer before the words come out and it's important the way equal opportunities employ us of information. It's not our job to go ignore one lot and listen to the rest or watch lot some lot and not pay attention at the words. Part of that-- this training is about be able to take whatever they've offered you. Yeah, so be like a sponge. 

01:58:25
 Grounded. 

01:58:30
CAITLIN WALKER Grounded. Grounded like what? 

01:58:30
 (inaudible ). 

01:58:32
CAITLIN WALKER Great. 

01:58:35
 I would say energetic and inspired. 

01:58:35
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, that's what you'd say, energetic and inspired. 

01:58:40
 That's why I need to be (inaudible ), yeah. 

01:58:45
CAITLIN WALKER Great, lovely. 

01:58:45
 I'm comfortable which I am now, hence(ph), and, uhm, receptive. 

01:58:55
CAITLIN WALKER He's comfortable and receptive, lovely. Now with any of those answers again, what kind of open? That open won't be like that one and when you're in a field like that, does that field have a size or shape? And a 5-year-old pristine child, is there anything else about that five-year old? And comfortable, and when you're comfortable, that's comfortable like what? So any of these things you can pull out the question on and what they do is they just help me making accurate model of you and then as much use and then if I later on want to say, so how could I support you, if we're gonna work together. The more information I have that's true about you then, these are it is and it probably, of course, as soon as you say tool bag I've got a model of what a tool bag is like. There's no way I could have guessed that yours is bottomless or that it matches your desktop or that you've got your shoes about you (inaudible ) more stuff and they're going to bottomless pit and you don't know where they are. You forget about those, you only see the ones at the top. Uhm, there's no way I can predict that. But now that I know that, it will give a di-- completely different way to the way I'd work with you. Although I'd work with one way, it's all about the color that you need for these transformational tools you've got, okay. Lovely, so let's start the five senses exercise and then you can start doing the work and I can relax. 

02:00:10
Five Senses 

02:00:15
CAITLIN WALKER So more or less what I'm doing is I tend to repeat a bit back of what you're saying, I tend to focus a bit-- on a bit of what you've said, so I might say, "And the 5-year-old pristine child, and when pristine," so kind of going and some stuff you've said and a bit of that where is that child? What kind of? That's like what? I might say, "And pristine, when pristine, that's pristine like what?" So, that's actually really, really simple and it's very formulate. There's nothing fancy about it. I just go some stuff, a word, a question, okay. So, I'm gonna take you through the five senses exercise which will help us orga-- a bit of a sense of where do we keep information, visual, kinesthetic, auditory. Uhm, I'll do it for a bit and then I'll say, "Okay, you will generate me one question for this person." Right, so, if I have a few questions I'm gonna stop and say, "What are you noticing either about yourself or pattern?" Hmm, and when I say pattern, all I mean by pattern is anything that happens three times. Uhm, I wanna try and teach patterning to, to the kids I worked with and they're coming and I say, "So, okay, so what's the pat..." "(inaudible ) legs crossed" "That's okay. I don't..." It's true, it's true that some people have or some people haven't and if, if it was if the pattern to the whole group is we have the legs crossed, you can just test that out. We can notice it and it's always look for what's out, you know, to, to the times when they don't do it. So it's not to get hung up on a pattern and go, "Oh, I'm really visual. I, I, I am," and then delete all the times when you're not. But just to go, oh, and notice that so and so made the picture three times and notice that every time someone speaks, I have a really detailed picture of it or people speak and I have no pictures. I get sensation here. Uhm, so once it's just, just a thing twice might be interesting but if you done it three times in a row or somebody else has done it three times in a row then, I might not notice that, bring it out for the group. And think about yourself as we notice in someone else. So the five senses, uhm, idea put forward that we think with the same senses that we experience the world in. So although we-- right now you can see, you can hear, most of you can smell, (inaudible ), uhm, you got the sense of touch some and maybe you might have, uhm, internal emotional like feelings or you might just have the feeling of where you're, you're bottoming your legs and touching your chair and that there were lots of experiences that were not conscious of. So we are experiencing it but we don't register it and the idea with the five senses is that we also use these five senses to represent information to us. So, for example, some of us will see pictures, some of us can make smells, remember smells, yes, in our minds and some of us can remember taste really clearly, others of us can't. So what we're gonna do is we're going to-- I'm gonna ask you a bunch questions to find out what are your preferred way of making sense of the world inside your minds. We start with visual. See an elephant. 

02:03:50
[sil.] 

02:03:55
CAITLIN WALKER What kind of elephant is it? 

02:04:00
 Mine is a gray elephant, just the top of the head with big ears and his trunk showing. 

02:04:05
CAITLIN WALKER A gray elephant, just top of his head big ears and his trunk showing. 

02:04:10
 Hm-huh. 

02:04:10
CAITLIN WALKER And when his trunk showing, is there anything else about his trunk? 

02:04:15
 Ah, yes, it's got (inaudible ) in it. Uhm, and it's about that long and it's shaped like that. 

02:04:25
CAITLIN WALKER Great. Who's not like that? 

02:04:25
 My elephant is not like that. Ah, there's an elephant and (inaudible ) so it's the mother with (inaudible ) big tusks and very protective, you know, don't mess with the elephant. Uhm... 

02:04:45
CAITLIN WALKER This is mother, a calf and she's got real big tusks. 

02:04:50
 Oh yeah, (inaudible ) and you can see this things from a distance because you can't get too close and its-- they have kind of savanna-type environment. 

02:05:00
CAITLIN WALKER Great, so savanna-type environment, mother, calf, she's got big tusks. Don't mess with that, very protective. Great, who's not like that? 

02:05:05
 Mine is very round and kinda like cartoon-like and it's kinda like looking back at me. So, I'm kinda seeing the elephant from the back but then it's looking around towards me where I (inaudible ) the upper trunk. 

02:05:22
CAITLIN WALKER So you can see it from the back - 

02:05:22
 Uh-hmm. 

02:05:22
CAITLIN WALKER - so it's very round. 

02:05:25
 Yeah. 

02:05:25
CAITLIN WALKER But with the back that you not (inaudible ) trunk. Is there anything else about that cartoon like elephant? 

02:05:30
 It's moving. 

02:05:35
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, what kind of moving? 

02:05:35
 Not kind of big movements, it's quite small movements. So like in terms the trunk like want to see it. The trunk is actually moving and the (inaudible ). 

02:05:50
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. What are you noticing? What the -- 

02:05:50
 Difference. 

02:05:55
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. What kind of of differences? 

02:05:55
 The, the... 

02:05:55
 (inaudible ) people to see an outcome. 

02:06:00
CAITLIN WALKER One instruction, it wasn't the difference as you're already noticing. 

02:06:05
 Size. 

02:06:05
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, so the size. 

02:06:05
 Perspective. 

02:06:10
CAITLIN WALKER Size, perspective. 

02:06:10
 (inaudible ). 

02:06:15
CAITLIN WALKER Yup, so there's size, ah, perspective, color, movement. 

02:06:30
 The symbolism. 

02:06:30
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. 

02:06:35
 Uhm, movements. 

02:06:40
CAITLIN WALKER Yes, sort of where is just, just... 

02:06:40
 And... 

02:06:40
CAITLIN WALKER So, so, some of you got them, like that. Others of you can-- he do the tusks but you're actually looking at it. It's a-- it's in a distance. 

02:06:50
 Yeah. 

02:06:55
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah? 

02:06:55
 I know (inaudible ) had to close his eyes to create a visualization (inaudible ) - 

02:06:59
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

02:06:59
 - (inaudible ). 

02:07:00
CAITLIN WALKER So then that's the process of how you come to have it? 

02:07:05
 Yeah. 

02:07:05
CAITLIN WALKER It does not need experience. So, how-- when did you-- was it just there immediately? Just raise your answer. 

02:07:10
 Yeah. 

02:07:10
CAITLIN WALKER See, and how ma-- many of you was there a bit of process before you got your elephant? That's great. And this is all-- basically this is all we're gonna do for couple of days, just go what you like. Somebody says some stuff, what happens and then as we start to work that out and organize it into some useful technology goes knowing that what would that how would this affect from what we did? Okay, so we got size, perspective, location, color, movement whether it's real - 

02:07:40
 Detail. 

02:07:40
CAITLIN WALKER - or imaginary, yup. And I'm mapping them like this because what I think-- I think clean questions do is they get you different kinds of information. They get you location, they get you detail, differences, they get you the sort of a symbolism of the whole thing and all you-- so you've just had a little bit example of that kind of thing with your tool box and your desktop where you're going to something that these are both like. Well, I haven't got that metaphor for you but I'll probably come later on but-- something that makes the whole thing together. Lovely, let's get a few more elephants. 

02:08:15
 Yeah, I (inaudible ) I was looking through the elephant, associating them to the elephant. So it was big and strong and heavy. 

02:08:25
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

02:08:25
 And I could only see sort of a part the trunk. 

02:08:30
CAITLIN WALKER And so it was a big and strong and heavy. Is there anything else about that elephant that you can see through the elephant associated with it? 

02:08:40
 Uhm, I can, I can, I can feel the back (inaudible ) much just, just the front of the, ah, trunk and the legs, front legs. 

02:09:05
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

02:09:10
 I could just see an elephant walking along but then it went straight down to (inaudible ). 

02:09:15
 Yeah, yeah, I'm (inaudible ) 

02:09:25
 Then I could see the elephant is going down. I was down there and I was walking (inaudible ). 

02:09:29
 (inaudible ). 

02:09:30
 (inaudible ) 

02:09:34
 (inaudible ). 

02:09:35
 You say things from (inaudible ) of perspective. 

02:09:38
CAITLIN WALKER So you, so you, you saw it the elephant there but then, but then it went down into the pool camp, you can hear it (inaudible ). 

02:09:50
 I just love doing it. 

02:09:50
CAITLIN WALKER It's quite like green just then to trunks into trunk a bit like on (inaudible ). Lovely. Okay, again, who's different to that? 

02:10:05
 I saw a photograph, uhm, of an elephant in the library and it's (inaudible ) that. 

02:10:10
CAITLIN WALKER When you saw the photograph and you represented that, so right now, like you just said that and I-- no, you just said that and I go, uhm, I can start to build up that model but I don't know where it is, what size or shape it is. So you just notice how many of your already started making a... 

02:10:25
 Things. 

02:10:30
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, so what have you made? 

02:10:30
 I can see a big book. It's quite shiny and (inaudible ). 

02:10:35
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Whose gonna didn't make that model? Chris(ph)? 

02:10:40
 Mine is a picture on a wall. So, with the big Afri-- what is it, big-- the ear ones, ah, really magnificent, 

02:10:45
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:10:45
 - ah, picture on a wall. 

02:10:45
CAITLIN WALKER So who's, ah, listen to that one whose (inaudible ) different new things she's have listening? 

02:10:50
 Mine is a big, old, dark, (inaudible ). 

02:10:55
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so the joy of clean questions is that in attempt to the second that you've listen to somebody speak, you've already started making the model of it. 

02:11:05
 Yeah. 

02:11:05
CAITLIN WALKER And then, when you go yeah, notice what you mean, all you really mean is I've made a sense of a model to myself in my head not that you actually know what's important to it, vital and right now we're just talking about an elephant I've asked you to see. But if this is a project that's got £4 million based behind it and we're gonna make some agreements in the meeting, I think it's just useful to have few questions to, to check out. So let's find out. So, when it's in the library, what kind of library? 

02:11:40
 A library that's got bookshelves. 

02:11:40
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, is there anything else about that library with a lot of bookshelves? 

02:11:50
 It's flat and so (inaudible ). 

02:11:55
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm, and whereabouts is the elephant? 

02:12:00
 Uhm, in one of the books that's out there from the library and, and just the picture on the, on the desk, just like that. 

02:12:10
CAITLIN WALKER And what kind of book is it? 

02:12:10
 (inaudible ). 

02:12:15
CAITLIN WALKER Is it science or (inaudible ). 

02:12:20
[sil.] 

02:12:25
 Encyclopedia (inaudible ). 

02:12:26
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, and whereabouts is the picture? 

02:12:30
 Uhm, it's, uhm, the book was open like that on page. 

02:12:40
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. Okay. 

02:12:45
 And then the book (inaudible) to see the pictures and the other thing. 

02:12:45
CAITLIN WALKER And so the book is facing that, that... 

02:12:50
 The book is facing back at me and about, about that's turn the book back one to see the elephant. 

02:12:55
CAITLIN WALKER Right. Lovely. And all the way... 

02:13:00
 There's a bit of me that say, "No, it's not. It's not like that. (inaudible ). I can see it. You're wrong." 

02:13:05
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, and you'll have (inaudible ) that something about, uhm, oh, it's and it's next to this kind of bush and somebody in the room said, "Oh, it's a such and such." She said, "No, no. It's not." I said, "No, it is. It grows in a such and such as this. It's got this kind of..." She said, "No." It was as fun and proper argument about the fact that this person could see one so clear in their mind then we're gonna argue about the lacking definition of it when she said it's not, it's not. 

02:13:35
 I need to take issue with your fluffy elephant. 

02:13:40
 It wasn't fluffy. 

02:13:40
 (inaudible ). 

02:13:43
CAITLIN WALKER And, and that-- it go... 

02:13:45
 Oh, you say fluffy. 

02:13:45
CAITLIN WALKER And that's a lovely, a lovely example of it. So the, so the issue he's got a-- the issue he's gonna take with it is not a presented issue, it's an inferred issue. He's interpreted it and it's gonna take an issue with his interpretation. Then, this again, we're just playing, this is what happens in meetings. Not that I started to go in meetings and track them that the-- all disagreements in meetings are based in inference and not on what's presented. That the, the, the issue with the sense you're making of what's been said not what's actually intended. 

02:14:15
 (inaudible ). 

02:14:20
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, and let's just finish, finish our elephants, so? 

02:14:20
 I did, yes. 

02:14:25
CAITLIN WALKER Go Jeff(ph). 

02:14:25
 So my elephant was a-- it's a, a stuff toy elephant and it's so over there (inaudible ). 

02:14:30
CAITLIN WALKER Fluffy, fluffy. 

02:14:30
 Ah, it's (inaudible ) and he's got, ah, (inaudible ) which is interesting when I was a 5-year old, ah, pristine child. I actually have that (inaudible ). 

02:14:50
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, yeah, so that's just see an elephant. Let's do some other senses. 

02:15:05
 (inaudible ) and I've almost, uhm, not deleted by a certain (inaudible ) I actually saw people who enriched my pictures I've now adopted and closes to it. 

02:15:20
 I've got nine. 

02:15:20
 Okay. 

02:15:20
 Nine elephants. 

02:15:20
CAITLIN WALKER So let's just-- look at, look at this difference, so we got one who's enriched, use the details. So, this one used the details to enrich one and almost got this is a pattern now of no deletion and distortion, just maintaining all of them. So he's got nine now who knows... 

02:15:40
 (inaudible ). 

02:15:43
CAITLIN WALKER Organize your elephants. They're not (inaudible ) and useful, they just, they just build as organized and who's then-- who notice that they've done something else? 

02:15:55
 I acknowledge that everybody else has picture - 

02:15:55
 Yeah. 

02:15:55
 - I accepted it while they were speaking and I just (inaudible ). 

02:16:00
 Uh-hmm. 

02:16:00
 I did not (inaudible ) as we talk to them. 

02:16:01
 Yeah, (inaudible ). 

02:16:03
 Yeah. (inaudible ) picture I got (inaudible ). 

02:16:06
 Yeah. 

02:16:06
 And then it live in that pictures. I mean, (inaudible ) picture of that they have. 

02:16:11
 Yup. 

02:16:15
 It was some sort about association that I haven't thought about until he spoke. 

02:16:20
CAITLIN WALKER But you, but you just say (inaudible ) elephant. 

02:16:21
 And I wanted to (inaudible ) other peoples. 

02:16:25
 A lot big. 

02:16:25
 So, I was sa-- I have nine. I was thinking, "Yeah, (inaudible ) elephant. 

02:16:30
 Almost on that. 

02:16:30
 I like to be in the bottom. 

02:16:30
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. And again if I can translate this into application, one of the things that, ah, children did when I stated to model with them was they just borrowed one another strategies. And they didn't have to say, you know, always it's the best one. You've able to copy her they're just-- I'd say, "So, who is the useful for this? Who is the useful for that?" And then they start to swap in and steal. I'd, I'd say you're welcome to cheat by borrowing other people's if you want to. 

02:17:00
 Yeah. 

02:17:00
 But it's not cheating. 

02:17:00
CAITLIN WALKER Well, of course, it's not. They're still making their own model of their models. 

02:17:05
 Ah, it also cuz you really case your different, uhm, ways in which you have solve information all the (inaudible ) cross association, absolute association - 

02:17:15
 Uh-hmm. 

02:17:15
 - pictures like in Facebook. Still in? 

02:17:20
CAITLIN WALKER I got another (inaudible ) views it. You know the swag? The huge bottomless. 

02:17:25
 It's get cool, really? 

02:17:25
 Yes, it get cool cuz you didn't got (inaudible ). 

02:17:27
CAITLIN WALKER In the other (inaudible ) they just keep (inaudible ). 

02:17:30
 Getting another thing to that. 

02:17:30
 (inaudible ). 

02:17:35
 That you got a full (inaudible ). 

02:17:36
 Yeah. Really want. 

02:17:40
CAITLIN WALKER Excellent. Okay, so another sense, uhm, taste lemon. What kind of lemon would ha-- what just happen? 

02:17:50
 It just (inaudible ). 

02:17:55
 The fruit (inaudible ) - 

02:17:56
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

02:18:00
 - and squeezed it. 

02:18:00
CAITLIN WALKER It's just work that one? So, it's just there quite enough and then get and then squeezed. Great. 

02:18:05
 I smelt it. 

02:18:10
CAITLIN WALKER You smelt it. 

02:18:10
 Yup. 

02:18:10
CAITLIN WALKER So, when you smelt it, you have anything else other than to smell? 

02:18:15
 Color yellow. 

02:18:20
CAITLIN WALKER Whereabouts is that, does it have a size or shape? 

02:18:20
 Back of my head and back of my throat. 

02:18:25
CAITLIN WALKER Now, those of you who have strong visualizes stop for a minute and imagine that when I say taste lemon, you got yellow there and the back of your throat and you can smell it. And that's, oh, not that it smell very rich but that's you-- what you don't do is what you've done which is to make a life-size picture of it. Now, just notice how differently your method is from what Samuelle(ph) has just done. And who, again, did something different to that? 

02:19:00
 I tasted it. 

02:19:00
 It's disgusting cuz it's too sour. And it just to taste in my mount full of (inaudible ). 

02:19:05
CAITLIN WALKER You know, there are so many things that probably we could have chosen so (inaudible ). She got peaceful. Yeah, who's, again, different? 

02:19:15
 (inaudible ). 

02:19:18
 Uh-uhm. 

02:19:20
 So they, they (inaudible ) in charge to that (inaudible ) as well. 

02:19:22
CAITLIN WALKER So, no one know where he had it. So, when he says I had Lemsip, I don't know. Does he mean that packet? Does he mean a glass of it? Does he mean-- that what does he mean? (inaudible ). 

02:19:34
 So it was the (inaudible ) inside the glass in it and it was, ah, (inaudible ). 

02:19:37
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Who's got something different? 

02:19:45
 Ah, I tasted it and I could actually (inaudible ) in my saliva and then, so yellow and it's sour. 

02:19:50
CAITLIN WALKER Oh, you indeed saw yellow, what kind of yellow did you see? 

02:19:50
 I'm-- a bright yellow all my mind. 

02:19:55
CAITLIN WALKER A bright yellow all in my mind. 

02:20:00
 I just saw a lemon there but when you taste it, (inaudible ) I didn't have any change reaction to which you just said (inaudible ). 

02:20:09
 (inaudible ). 

02:20:10
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-uhm. Yup. How about you? 

02:20:15
 (inaudible ) actually taste it or got a, got a lot of representations of previous experiences of lemon including yellow, uhm, and... 

02:20:25
CAITLIN WALKER So when you've got a lot of association, whereabouts have you got those associations? 

02:20:30
 I'm sitting in front of, uhm, table. I am got lots of pictures of times when I've had lemon and times I used to give my very small (inaudible ) lemon (inaudible ). It sounds funny, I know, but it's... 

02:20:45
 (inaudible ) interpretation to you. 

02:20:50
 So far (inaudible ), uhm... 

02:20:52
 (inaudible ). 

02:21:00
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. So you got lots of different associations? 

02:21:00
 Yeah. When I-- when you say wherever I (inaudible ) there are lots of different (inaudible ) of lemonade drinks and whole lemons. I'll be cooking with, ah, since lots of-- it's a very multi-sensory experience that I don't actually taste lemon (inaudible ). 

02:21:18
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, lovely. Could anyone different to that? 

02:21:20
 Tequila. That I couldn't have a lemon on its own, I had to go back with the experienced one (inaudible ). 

02:21:30
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

02:21:30
 That was tequila and salt, all together. 

02:21:35
CAITLIN WALKER And then as you listen to other people's lemons? 

02:21:35
 Well, I've got lemon in my head as well. 

02:21:35
 (inaudible ). 

02:21:40
 (inaudible ) exactly the same to my doctor and draw pictures of it. (inaudible ). 

02:21:45
 (inaudible [02:21:50). 

02:21:45
 Yeah. 

02:21:45
CAITLIN WALKER Great. Okay, we will go, go quite as (inaudible ) through this cuz what I'm really interested now is for you to start to taking patterns then I'm gonna get you to generate some questions with me. So, third one. 

02:22:05
[sil.] 

02:22:10
CAITLIN WALKER Smell smoke. What kind of smoke? 

02:22:20
 Cigarette at the back of my throat. 

02:22:20
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. Anything else about it? 

02:22:25
 Quite choking. 

02:22:25
CAITLIN WALKER Quite choking. All right, who hasn't got that? 

02:22:30
 Cigarette smoke smelling it all through the nose and as you cry like (inaudible ). 

02:22:37
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. You're smelling it over-- through your nose? 

02:22:37
 Hm-huh. 

02:22:40
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. Uhm, when you're smelling it, is anyone notice that they're seeing as well? 

02:22:40
 Oh, yeah. 

02:22:45
 Yeah. 

02:22:45
 Yeah, it's a very clean. 

02:22:45
CAITLIN WALKER Can you show me, just raise your hands if you, if you made a picture. Okay, and then what if you do and tho-- 

02:22:50
 Well, the smoke (inaudible ) for location. 

02:22:53
CAITLIN WALKER -okay, and then, which of you could smell it but didn't make a picture of it? 

02:22:55
 I, I saw the word smoke. 

02:23:00
CAITLIN WALKER Upper or lower case? 

02:23:00
 Lower case. 

02:23:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, what did you do? 

02:23:05
 Nothing. 

02:23:05
CAITLIN WALKER Nothing. So when you couldn't -- 

02:23:10
 Couldn't do it. 

02:23:10
CAITLIN WALKER So when yo couldn't do it, what are you doing? 

02:23:10
 Yes, I was just trying to smell it and because I couldn't smell it, I was doing exactly the same in the same picture or I was seeing light in a, ah, an environment that I have been in before I couldn't smell it. 

02:23:25
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. So the two of pattern that I've detect so far is this. Straight following all of his answers so far cuz we don't know really difference when you've been pattern detector and being psychologist about no i-- idea or no interest particularly in why just how often it seen but something happens that he does da-da-da-da, with the slight movement (inaudible ) at the same time. Any patterns that you are noticing either about yourself, something that you noticed you've done each time? 

02:24:05
 I, I definitely, uhm, with respects interpret what you say as I want it. 

02:24:15
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

02:24:15
 So, you said smell smoke, the image I have wasn't of smelling smoke. It was smoke related but it was the strongest image patterns there for me. You, you (inaudible ) control of what I saw (inaudible ) impromptu. 

02:24:35
CAITLIN WALKER Right. 

02:24:35
 And it clean like that the more I think. 

02:24:35
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so it's... 

02:24:40
 And it because in the quick (inaudible ) the lemon one for me it was-- I've, I've saw the f-- full image of (inaudible ) and when she was in (inaudible ). 

02:24:55
CAITLIN WALKER That's I've got very little control because thinking yup, yeah, anyone else notice a pattern either in yourselves or in other people? 

02:25:00
 No, so you, you have got control of one thinking but not how I interpret your problem. 

02:25:05
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, so I do a prompt but doing your inter-- inter-- interpretation is very much yours, uh-hmm. 

02:25:15
 I think I did quite a lot of facial expression as soon as you're giving prompt. 

02:25:20
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

02:25:20
 Whether it's (inaudible ) the smoke. 

02:25:22
CAITLIN WALKER I know you do because I've seen. 

02:25:25
 Yeah, was the like. 

02:25:25
CAITLIN WALKER Things move slowly then. 

02:25:25
 Either than smoke, what I did was smoke in fire alarm evacuation, that's me. I wonder where that is. 

02:25:35
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ) teacher's so, of course, that, ah... 

02:25:40
 Yeah, so yeah, and I can feel once (inaudible ) my face didn't like doing something. 

02:25:45
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, and so I could see it with, with lemon. 

02:25:50
 Oh yeah. 

02:25:50
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, anything-- anyone else noticed anything that they're doing or that other people are doing? 

02:25:55
 I noticed with (inaudible ) but each time that I've had an internal image and each time it's been so-- somewhere over there. 

02:26:05
 Yeah. 

02:26:05
 So, over to the left and so, so the elephant was down, ah, the Lemsip was about there and the smoke, the image was (inaudible ) kitchen and that was over there. It's all I'm saying. They have, they have so (inaudible ) to the left but in different, ah, (inaudible ) over there. 

02:26:23
 (inaudible ). 

02:26:25
 (inaudible ). 

02:26:35
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, so there's-- some of you got a pattern of location of where you're seeing things. 

02:26:35
 I think now that you (inaudible ) you made me realize that I see the picture and it's just-- that it just comes there. 

02:26:45
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so you've got a bit of the persistence as well. (inaudible ) it comes. Yup. Lovely. Anyone else noticed a pattern in themselves or in other people? 

02:26:55
 I feel very, uhm, like, ah, connecting while people are talking and then completely disassociating. I'm very focused on you and what you're saying, I'm just doing that. So, I'm completely blocking everything else out of the room that seems like there's space between you and me and that was it. 

02:27:10
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. And certainly then if I think of that as a pattern then we saw on the one she's associates in, it's like that. So it's twice and we don't know if that's pattern yet but it'll just watch whether she has, ah, something that's, that's like that in front (inaudible ) if I'd been over there. Would she needed a turn and have it again? 

02:27:30
 I think I would have. I feel I was drifting in and drifting out of other people more than I. So I, I really on the (inaudible ) in that and to creating a story with the people's words. 

02:27:45
CAITLIN WALKER When you create in their worlds, whereabouts do you drift to? 

02:27:50
 Uhm, it's like I'm alone. It's like I'm on the dream world and it's like, uhm, a television program - 

02:28:00
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:28:00
 - or a film. 

02:28:00
CAITLIN WALKER And where especially do you go to? So, for example, if you take Samuelle's(ph) elephant that she associated into the strong and she can feel it's back. She can't see very much but the front of the trunk, where are you now that you've drifted? 

02:28:10
 I'm right there. 

02:28:15
CAITLIN WALKER Whereabouts? 

02:28:15
 Right there. 

02:28:20
CAITLIN WALKER Right there. Yeah, because-- it's one of the things I want you to notice. I need to move around to show you this. So, once that she drift into other people's worlds, does that mean-- and this is a big modeling question for you, does she drift to here and experience it from that perspective or does she take what she's hearing and build somewhere else that-- so, for example, those of you who remember the model you made of Chris's(ph) elephant, where have you made your model of his model? 

02:28:50
 There. 

02:28:55
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. So, just notice, look around. So, you've-- most of you have translated it and that mean that you've left it where he pointed to it. 

02:29:00
 Yeah. 

02:29:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. So, some of you are built in a space where he's got his. Most of you translated it to another location. 

02:29:10
 I wasn't consciously aware of that and I'm just wondering if it's this (inaudible ) when I was dyslexic but I actually (inaudible ) to be respectful of where you add it and I've know-- I've completely removed it. 

02:29:25
CAITLIN WALKER So, now, just... 

02:29:25
 It's okay. 

02:29:25
CAITLIN WALKER What we're doing, each, each round that we do, I want another layer of information for you to attend to. Uhm, and then all we're gonna do is keep on doing this and add some questions in. So, even if you don't get it (inaudible ) we can do it again and we will do it again. The more optimist exercise a thousand times that exaggeration, ah, every time I do it I learn something new about people or the persons or myself. Feel ice. Obviously, we're cold. So, what kind of ice? 

02:30:10
 Cold ice. It's freezing cold. 

02:30:15
CAITLIN WALKER Whereabouts is it? 

02:30:15
 Uhm, I don't think-- I saw you can (inaudible ). And so I didn't see anything, I just felt like ice. It's like shivery cold. 

02:30:30
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. And I just felt it and when felt it whereabouts? 

02:30:35
 Kinda like all over. 

02:30:45
CAITLIN WALKER All over. 

02:30:45
 Yeah. 

02:30:45
CAITLIN WALKER And shivery cold. 

02:30:45
 Yeah. 

02:30:45
CAITLIN WALKER And when shivery cold - 

02:30:50
 Uh-hmm. 

02:30:50
CAITLIN WALKER - what kind of shivery is that? 

02:30:55
 Gosh. Uhm, very cold shivery so I'd say would kind of freezing. 

02:31:05
 Here, have a scarf. 

02:31:05
 Thank you. 

02:31:05
CAITLIN WALKER Who's not like that? Thelma(ph). 

02:31:10
 Uhm, pins and needles in my fingers and my toes. 

02:31:15
CAITLIN WALKER Pins and needles in my fingers and my toes. And when pins and needles, is there anything else about pins and needles? 

02:31:25
 Uhm, my fingers feel swollen. 

02:31:30
CAITLIN WALKER And my fingers feel swollen. And when my fingers feel swollen that's swollen like what? 

02:31:40
 Uhm, hot burning, uhm, something pumping. 

02:31:45
CAITLIN WALKER Pumping. Great. Thank you. So, I'm gonna ask the next person, I'm gonna repeat it, I'm gonna do the and, and the and when and I'm gonna ask you to generate me a few questions for that. We're not gonna actually asking them, just (inaudible ) up. So, somebody else. What kind of ice is that? 

02:32:05
 Ice cube in my mouth. 

02:32:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Ice cube in my mouth. Generate, generate me a, a clean question about that. To some ice cube in my mouth and when... 

02:32:15
 The ice cubes in your mouth, that's like what? 

02:32:20
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, great, another question. 

02:32:25
 When the ice cubes in your mouth, what kind of size and shape is that ice cubes in your mouth? 

02:32:25
 (inaudible ). 

02:32:30
CAITLIN WALKER No. 

02:32:30
 For (inaudible ). 

02:32:35
CAITLIN WALKER Where not interested Chris(ph) because we're generating questions. Another one. 

02:32:35
 And when an ice cube in your mouth, is there anything else about it? 

02:32:45
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

02:32:45
 And when ice cube in your mouth, is there anything else about ice cube? 

02:32:50
 Okay 

02:32:55
CAITLIN WALKER And ice cube in my mouth and when mouth just that mouth have a size or a shape? 

02:33:05
 Big mouth. No, it's just my (inaudible ). Yeah, big mouth. 

02:33:10
 Yeah. Big mouth. 

02:33:10
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Okay, so you get the hang of it. And what do you do now being have those questions? 

02:33:20
 That I feel really frustrated I don't be enable to answer. 

02:33:20
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. 

02:33:20
 And it's made the intensity of the ice in the mouth, ah, more stronger. 

02:33:25
CAITLIN WALKER Great. 

02:33:30
 Ah, which is great actually cuz it's still cold gonna bit hard on that thing. 

02:33:30
CAITLIN WALKER So, somebody else... 

02:33:30
 Get a (inaudible ) ant put it right kinda amaze so I'm just... 

02:33:35
CAITLIN WALKER There already have it in three minutes. Uhm, something else, what kind of ice is it? 

02:33:45
 Seems like years and years ago, we use to get real icicles (inaudible ). And there's a kids pull it off and just-- that's the sensation of the cold, slippery ice, you know. 

02:33:55
 Yeah, so years and years ago-- seems like years and years ago, he's got really long icicles of (inaudible ) there's a kid use to pull them off. 

02:34:05
 And what did you do with it then? 

02:34:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, and that then we'll, we'll bring in the sequence questions a little bit later. 

02:34:10
 Sorry. 

02:34:10
CAITLIN WALKER It's all right. But a clean, a clean question (inaudible ) and you pull them off and then what happens? But just for now, I just want you to stick with these when we-- while you're learning them. What happens next or and then what happens... 

02:34:25
 And then what happens after (inaudible )? 

02:34:30
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. And years and years ago, seems like years and years ago and when years and years ago whereabouts of those years and years? Couple more questions? 

02:34:45
 And you get something like that? And when-- what kind of is that? 

02:35:00
 And, and when-- what kind size and shape is? 

02:35:05
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely, great. So, we're gonna go to the next sense. And, again, this is all we're gonna be doing is just generating some questions. So, that was feel ice, listen to a song that you like. 

02:35:25
[sil.] 

02:35:35
CAITLIN WALKER Listen we want to know if it is quite interesting to see the difference from what people do when they're listening as opposed to what they do when they're looking or feeling and most of you are doing this. And some of you are doing this, and some of you doing this. 

02:35:55
 I'm so conscious of not rocking now. 

02:36:00
 Want some? 

02:36:00
CAITLIN WALKER It's all kind of music. 

02:36:00
 I can't view anything. 

02:36:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. What song? 

02:36:05
 All I can, I can say (inaudible ) bird singing on a tree but I can't view anything (inaudible ) some. 

02:36:11
CAITLIN WALKER So, all I can see are birds singing on a tree and that same place you've already identified? So, I and I can't hear anything all I can see are birds singing on a tree. When birds-- do these birds have a size or a shape? Generate me some more questions for her. 

02:36:35
 And birds, and when birds whereabouts are those birds? 

02:36:45
 And when you can't hear anything, what happens next? 

02:36:45
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. 

02:36:50
 And is there anything else about the bird? 

02:36:55
CAITLIN WALKER A bird singing on a tree and when tree, what kind of tree is that tree? 

02:37:05
 A bird singing and when singing what kind of singing? 

02:37:10
CAITLIN WALKER That's lovely. 

02:37:15
 And when birds, what type of birds are they? 

02:37:20
CAITLIN WALKER Great, let's do something different. 

02:37:25
 I got, ah, I'm a rocker singing (inaudible ). 

02:37:30
 (inaudible ). 

02:37:31
 But it's only that (inaudible ). 

02:37:40
CAITLIN WALKER And can you hear it? 

02:37:40
 Yeah. 

02:37:40
CAITLIN WALKER Who here can hear it as though it was happening? 

02:37:45
 Yeah. 

02:37:45
CAITLIN WALKER Just let me see you-- show your hands. Okay. Who can hear it but they happen to make the sound themselves? And who can’t hear? Lovely. 

02:38:00
[sil.] 

02:38:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Just like another thi-- things right now we've-- most of you can see in a group slightly bigger, you'll find some people don't make pictures at all. Not be very interesting because that just are-- rich representation but for those of you have visual it can be baffling to think how can it then be sensible and how could they remember people if they can't see them. And for those of you who have got really rich auditory, it will astound you that some of us can't hear anything. I have no auditory record(ph). I don't-- as soon as you stop speaking, I can't hear your voices but I can recognize them. But a pattern in, uhm, is a, is a picture. I see what you've said that's how I remember words, I read them back. So, when you speak I see words hanging around you. So, I've got that I'm interventionist or those words that the things that have been said I see hanging around him. And that might seem strange to some of you but I think the idea of hear it-- hearing sounds in your head seem so extraordinarily weird to me. I don't know how you live with yourselves. Oh, because it just... 

02:39:15
 When you first said, uhm, like to-- like hear a song I have a real problem, go ahead in lots of different songs that goes like, "Oooh! Oooh!" (inaudible ) cuz that's what's going on. 

02:39:25
CAITLIN WALKER But imagine if you don't hear-- if you've never heard anything in your head, how weird that will sound. 

02:39:30
 Yeah. 

02:39:30
CAITLIN WALKER Cuz there's nothing happening. How can you hear music? 

02:39:30
 I'm quite used to hearing little voices in my head. 

02:39:35
CAITLIN WALKER But all I know that the little voices saying, "It's break time," ah, and if you don't have a break soon. So, what I'd like you to do is we're gonna have just a brief break but do within a lot of heady thinking. We're gonna have a brief break and then we're gonna just get into small groups and go what are you learning about yourself, the process, how might this be applicable or ideas that you're having about how you could use what-- just a tiny bit you've learned so far. Okay, so have... 

02:40:05
Five Senses Part 2 

02:40:05
CAITLIN WALKER So it (inaudible ) a moment ago, so what? So, what that you do this in your head? So what? Why it might be useful to know about this? 

02:40:20
 A lot of, uhm, I'm giving here, for instance, uhm, I was (inaudible ). And one of the girl has got ADHD and she said, we're doing, uhm, (inaudible ) and she, she said that she goes from (inaudible ). That's how she described it, (inaudible ). She doesn't know how she did-- how she does that so I think we really go to model, ah, and (inaudible ) that with, with certainly young people because I think it, it can articulate (inaudible ) adult can. Uhm, so, it's quite-- it's a quite good way of, of working with somebody, uhm, somebody's preferences in quite simple way. 

02:41:00
CAITLIN WALKER Yup, with young people I've find, if you do the five senses exercise, you just did first. 

02:41:05
 Hm-huh. 

02:41:05
CAITLIN WALKER They don't understand that they do keep things in space and that's not the same as one another until they've noticed that and then after that it's easy for them-- easy-- much easier for them to model themselves out. It's a great starting point. Yeah, other people. 

02:41:20
 Ah, I do a lot of work around, uhm, (inaudible ) the communication because of the (inaudible ) to the community I work in. And that the conflicts (inaudible ) and that (inaudible ) understanding of people's maps and the maps not being the territory and it seems to me a really clean way to do it because we look at-- we-- I would (inaudible ) people. 

02:41:45
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

02:41:45
 And, and that's what... 

02:41:45
 (inaudible ). 

02:41:48
 - and, and not threaten. 

02:41:48
 (inaudible ). 

02:41:50
 It's quite different. 

02:41:50
 Yeah. 

02:41:50
 (inaudible ). 

02:41:52
 (inaudible ). 

02:41:53
 Differently, I think so. 

02:41:53
 We'll take the (inaudible ) from that. 

02:41:55
CAITLIN WALKER I want to tell you a, a story about, uhm, once when I was working with the police and they're a fantastic group of people to work with cuz they're brilliant pattern detectors. Sometimes, you'll get a group, they're very used to do in the pattern detecting but they don't like it done about themselves - 

02:42:05
 Hmm. 

02:42:10
CAITLIN WALKER - so I sat down with this police and I said, uhm, that it-- this is what we're gonna do and we're gonna look at how you make models of you with these statements and how your questions then come up your models in a-- rather than what's being presented and how to get that cleaner. We started with see an elephant and I start with first guy. I said, "What kind of elephant (inaudible )?" "I have to tell you what my elephant is like. I'm not sure it was inside my head." And I thought, "Oh, I have not come across this before." So, I was gonna go into somebody else but there is this whole group and, uhm, you know, I'm used to a bit of resistance but not-- this, this just seem to be the whole thing. So, the sergeant was with us and, ah, he's also a trainer and he came in and he said, he said, "All right, fine. We will do what she's gonna do. I'll, I'll lead the training then. What I want you to do is I want you to remember the last set of experience you had. I want you think about who was with, how it started , what was the first thing that happened, w here was the first contact, what was the co-- what was the, the piquet, it was like and then how it ended and what happened afterwards. I want you to think about it in detail and we will start one at a time, you give me a full-blown description." I go, "All right," cuz they're very-- there's real sense of obediency of you got to do it (inaudible ). And he said, "That's what you do to kids, remember when it's day in and day out. That's essentially what you're telling them, asking them to tell you, explain to you and you won't tell her what you (inaudible ) what it looks like." And that was really - 

02:43:42
 Uh-hmm. 

02:43:45
CAITLIN WALKER - that was a really important thing for me to think about was I do think these questions can go quite deep sometimes. 

02:43:55
 Uh-hmm. 

02:43:55
CAITLIN WALKER But lots of questions go quite deep sometimes. Questions about the community, questions about and such of things, if you gonna be go, go deep, go clean if you, if you can. Clean, ah, non-judgmental, it's just, it's just information, yup. 

02:44:10
 Yeah. 

02:44:10
CAITLIN WALKER Anything else that you're thinking about? I mean, what's the (inaudible )? 

02:44:16
 It's a gentle (inaudible ) used it in everyday. (inaudible ). 

02:44:25
CAITLIN WALKER So, what might be to use? Why not-- why know it? 

02:44:35
 I think it's more of the perception because it's understanding that the way we use the words, we perceived different things. 

02:44:45
CAITLIN WALKER So, you can understand differences in perceptions. Uh-huh. 

02:44:55
 Sam(ph), if your situation you were dealing with some type of conflict resolution, so you got (inaudible ), get each other’s point of view at all. 

02:45:05
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, ah, but a lovely one just recently, uhm, that if-- it's just a perfect example, I was so glad they did it because if they didn't, they won't be learning, the whole group couldn't have learn as well. And we're doing in a (inaudible ) so we got 12 people. We've got to agree how to evaluate a project that they've got a lot money for and a couple of people have key to it. Uhm, often, don't see eye to eye. We've got different ways of working and they, they acknowledge that. They all takes the law of group time and they're not saying (inaudible ) and you, all experience this and so they reach the stage where they got to build a common model for the project. So, one of them says, "It's really important to me that they-- that it-- that it's unclear," and the other one says, "It's so unclear. That's a really negative thing, I don't want that out there." 

02:45:55
 Uh-hmm. 

02:45:55
CAITLIN WALKER This is not a negative thing, that's just your model of the world because what is a negative thing and they could da-da-da-da-da-da and so I say I would come in very, very swiftly. I got there, I just stop between the two of them. My hand between the two of them and I go, "When it's unclear, that's unclear like what?" So, was it like you've been building a road and you come there to the (inaudible ) your building. You just got the landscape and it's your choice which way the road goes and stop. What is un-- something's unclear? That's unclear like what? It was like a big black door straight in front of you and you can't see anything away. You go and you don't know what's happening, okay. So what they're arguing about is the models those words meaning for them not (inaudible ) this one so if what she means is it's unclear like you've come to the end of the road and da-da-da. Oh, yeah, that's all right. (inaudible ) with the word, can we call it uncharted? Yes, right but you can just see how that could have been such a waste and it would, it goes very quickly into conflict of them arguing, her saying that she's try-- she could-- you could say that, that -- these two people say that but she could say this person is trying to sabotage the project by getting us all in a state of not knowing. 

02:47:05
 Yeah. 

02:47:10
CAITLIN WALKER When he mention not at all, yup. 

02:47:10
 There's clarity so as they cuz it, when you're in the meeting, caught (inaudible ) like I'm really not quite (inaudible ) at the meeting be it personally (inaudible ). 

02:47:24
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

02:47:24
 Because, yeah, there's such a lack of clarity in those questions focused on the clarity. So, if a meeting was (inaudible ). 

02:47:35
CAITLIN WALKER Now, for that, I used to do this for big projects but for now I've started doing this in even in a-- in a one-hour meeting. It's been two minutes at the start saying for this meeting to be really successful, to be really useful, it'll be like what? And even if people are trying to say, "Oh, it'll it will be speedy, speedy like what? Like I'm a sorting machine and it's just go "tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk!" Okay, somebody else and you just two minutes then, for-- to be like this, what are we gonna have to be like and how can-- if you are the facilitator of the meeting, how can I suport it? How can I support you to get what you want? You don't have to go to huge metaphors but just a quick meeting setup then what I like to do is I like to put their outcomes. 

02:48:20
 So I can see it. 

02:48:20
CAITLIN WALKER And I might expand it with what we will have at the end of it. 

02:48:25
 Yeah. 

02:48:25
CAITLIN WALKER Check, check, check, check, check. So, even though we might have an, an agenda, if you got time you can use this to set your agenda. If you got, ah, send us an e-mail and get it back. Oh, I just have it on the white board and as we go through you can go-- write bits of information, check and even if somebody doesn't get what you want, you can say, "Look, so I understand that what you really want out of this is this, big picture for the whole thing but we're not-- I can see we're not gonna have time for that. Uhm, I apologize we're gonna have to go through this but we'll do that at the next meeting." Just so, what you don't get is the solemness in the arguing. So, I'd really recommended that for set up. 

02:49:00
 Oh, oh, just a fuck(ph). That's what I think of it. It's not, it's not-- doesn't say it necessary come to conflict. Just more like you feel, you've been-- its meeting it. It's been complete (inaudible ) time because you have achieved nothing. 

02:49:10
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. 

02:49:10
 I often do not meet the point of the meeting, so... 

02:49:15
CAITLIN WALKER Since we've done this, what would-- suddenly we... 

02:49:15
 Can take that for something, yes. 

02:49:20
CAITLIN WALKER With-- what we've found with this is it's, it, it seems to making swifter. 

02:49:20
 Yeah. 

02:49:20
CAITLIN WALKER And there's less revisiting of things. 

02:49:25
 Yeah. 

02:49:25
 What's about the(inaudible )? 

02:49:28
 (inaudible ). 

02:49:30
CAITLIN WALKER (crosstalk) same thing. Uhm, the-- but there's a bit I haven't got here which is then how can I-- supposing you and I set up the course. For this course to be really successful, it will be like what? You'd like to be like what during it? Clean questions then to elaborate it, so I-- now here, I'm not trying to just find out what it's like for her. At least, I'm trying to find out what it's like so I can help her. So then I'll be, ah, I will be asking things so what, what will I see or hear that let me know you're in that state and then it leads to how can I support you but what actually (inaudible ) that was really important you turn up half an hour before we start everyday so that we can do this, this and this. okay. Now I've got reasons even if I don't want to, at least I know how it'll affect my training partners. So the, the next bit here oh, I'll put this later is how-- what's in there? What's beyond that? How can I support you? 

02:50:20
 Further(ph) experience with commercial organization, managing directors are sending his people like that. How are they going to, ah, greet this kind of a portrays(ph) that it will be like this new cuz we're quiet. I would imagine during that, ah, thinking of pictures or emotions and feelings, this is gonna be ailing to people like that, I would imagine. 

02:50:40
CAITLIN WALKER Well, it's part of the MBA, uhm, during your MBA course and it's going there. Lots of the commercial work I've got has come from that course and visualization and creative management or creative leadership and it's just lapped up mainly because it gives people legitimacy to, to think of the strategic, symbolic level about things. And they go, we're doing some creative thinking, call it what you like. So, I, I actually haven't find any issues with it. 

02:51:15
Learning Point You can't build rapport from a position of contempt 

02:51:20
 I didn't know what, what it is as an outcome but I think I do now as well and I have come to my own conclusions about that. Uhm, because the people I find most difficult to work with are those people who stand in the way of change. We will hold on to the state as well because it's their stand without serving others. 

02:51:40
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-huh, so what's an outcome now that you know that? 

02:51:45
 Well, if I just, ah, to actually-- I, I've managed people incredibly difficult to work with and I just don't tolerate them. 

02:51:50
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

02:51:50
 And I know I have to if I'm gonna achieve change because that people if, you've got the power to give that change. So, what I want if that, ah, a better ability to create change through the progress of power. 

02:52:05
CAITLIN WALKER Fantastic and to do that, the chance of you doing that from a position of intolerance. 

02:52:10
 Is impossible. 

02:52:10
CAITLIN WALKER It's possible, and the more you understand the structure and what's important to the ma-- the nobility in their system to think that's the highest order much it-- the much easier it is to work with them so you're actually are achievers (inaudible ) want. 

02:52:25
[music] 

02:52:30
CAITLIN WALKER That's your nemesis. At what stage are you willing to give up the things that are really hold you being you in order to go to higher level and build a relationship with them in order to get whatever is even more important than that which is this social order that you want? 

02:52:45
 You're asking me that question? 

02:52:50
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. Not necessarily to be answered right. 

02:52:50
 (inaudible ) something that works. 

02:52:55
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, so it will be effectiveness. So when you've got something that will still affect the thing that you want long term and you got some kind of-- you actually find it s-- you are able to work with them successfully, so... 

02:53:05
 (inaudible ). 

02:53:08
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:53:10
 Finding that, just-- I'll keep all the contempt for them. 

02:53:10
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. It's very hard to be flexible once you've got somebody in a position of contempt. You'll know it yourselves if you had a relationship with somebody. Once you've moved them into position of contempt for having them to do anything right because it's so easy to delete the store of what they do once you're in a position of contempt. Another type of my work, my, my working title for it is From Contempt to Curiosity. That, that's what I-- if you say, what's the essence of what I do, I shift positions from contempt to curiosity. Yup, that's it cuz as long as these kids were intent on contempt, there was nothing I could do with them. 

02:53:50
 No, no, I'm not communicating effectively. I can-- people without power can give them... 

02:53:55
CAITLIN WALKER I understand. Ah, what you're saying is your fine at that level and I'm saying, "Great. Find the level that you hold them up to contempt because that's your block, that's what's-- you're not gonna shift at all as long as you having that flexibility to shift out of your contempt. (inaudible ) they wanna build the relationship with your, your ideals. 

02:54:15
 So I can observe that. What I'm, I'm watching is you have a model of these people, uhm, and you're limiting them to that model and therefore, you can't influence them while you've in ca-- in case them in this limited model of them. 

02:54:30
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:54:30
 Because they're all individuals. 

02:54:30
CAITLIN WALKER Which is-- and if you watch so much as modelling you. So you've got them here. You got the rest of people here. These people you have no difficulty from what she gestures. These ones you do. Now, as long as you've got them one separated to a different attribute around, they aren't people in the same right. They don't the same-- they don't have the same degree of respect or your interest or curiosities as, as this one’s do. 

02:54:55
 I'd been watching (inaudible ) with you. 

02:54:57
 Okay. 

02:54:57
 Because you completely disassociated yourself on them. You-- you've put them, you've encased them in this, uhm, this limit, this limitation that you put around them. Therefore, you're not going to be able to influence them and then you can keep repeating. They couldn't get the shape anyway as one of the things you said. 

02:55:15
 Right. 

02:55:20
CAITLIN WALKER No, I'm not flexible enough to find a really effective way to work with them with my -- 

02:55:20
 That's what I want. 

02:55:20
CAITLIN WALKER -fantastic, fantastic. But they'll always be an ability in your system that will shift as well. 

02:55:25
Learning at your best Asking Clean Questions 

02:55:30
CAITLIN WALKER So, when you're learning at your best, you're like what? Another volunteer. Be the first person. 

02:55:40
 Yes. 

02:55:40
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, Sarah(ph), when you're learning at your best you're like what? 

02:55:40
When you're learning at your best you're like what? Like a kite soaring high in the sky 

02:55:45
 Uhm, when I'm learning at my best I'm like a kite soaring high in the sky. 

02:55:50
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, go ahead. 

02:55:50
 When the kite is soaring in the sky whereabouts it in the sky (inaudible ). 

02:56:00
 It, it can go anywhere, that's what it's like. It can go anywhere in the sky (inaudible ). 

02:56:10
 When the sky is big and open and there's no limit and when the sky is big like that, is there anything else about that sky? 

02:56:20
 Blue and bright. Yeah, it's blue and bright. 

02:56:25
 Blue. 

02:56:30
 Uhm, uhm, and the sky are really bright, is there anything else about bright and blue? 

02:56:35
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, now I just wanna notice what's happened. Right, to write a first stanza, then Chris(ph) (inaudible ) and got the answer it's blue and bright. This is gonna have enough to bright and we're now two, three steps away from the original answer having only gone on one word. Now, that's not the problem but right now while you're just learning it, the chance are you'll got a little bit lost so I'm gonna encourage you not to go further than two steps away. So, we'll get an answer to this one which I'll put in indigo but in your indigo's zone by then. So what was that-- what kind of bright? 

02:57:25
[sil.] 

02:57:30
 Bright, bright, energetic bright. 

02:57:35
[sil.] 

02:57:40
CAITLIN WALKER So, energetic bright. It's blue and bright. There's no limits. The sky is big and open. 

02:57:45
 Uhm, Caitlin, that's the question, that last question is the one which doesn't make sense to me. 

02:57:50
CAITLIN WALKER Which one is that? 

02:57:50
 And what kind of bright. 

02:57:55
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh, so right now just notice it doesn't make sense to you cuz there will be other people who won't make sense to you, just hold that and then notice the, the effect it has in different people, yup. So an energetic bright. It's blue and bright. Sky is big and open. A kite soaring high in the sky. Generate another question. 

02:58:15
 When kite soaring high in the sky, what kind of kite, uhm, that kite soaring high in the sky? Uhm, (inaudible ) kite. 

02:58:27
 Kite, uhm, and I think (inaudible ) shape-- kite (inaudible ) shape. Kite-shaped kite. 

02:58:35
[sil.] 

02:58:40
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:58:40
 (inaudible ). 

02:58:50
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. What it usually means is dirty i-- if it's not, if it's not obvious. 

02:58:55
 I'm not worried about-- well, I'm not worried about-- well, obviously (inaudible ). 

02:59:00
CAITLIN WALKER Look, a-- a-- ask, ask it, ask it to me. 

02:59:00
 Okay. 

02:59:00
CAITLIN WALKER Not to her. 

02:59:00
 Sorry. 

02:59:00
CAITLIN WALKER So, whenever you got a question that either you've got concern about or (inaudible ) to ask, take it to the front. let the group discuss it and we'll clean it up for you. 

02:59:10
 It's just about the control of the kite, is it got the string attached? 

02:59:15
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. 

02:59:15
 (inaudible ). 

02:59:17
CAITLIN WALKER So there'll be something in his model that's got an importance about where is the control, is it attached, yeah. So, because she hasn't said it, it will be unclean to ask about it. Now, again, this is mine and Elise's(ph) project that we're doing together, I can say to her, "Oh, I'm really worried that if-- as it got to sky as, as it got to sky. Has, has it got string attached? But that's a conversation, that's not modelling. 

02:59:40
 True. 

02:59:40
CAITLIN WALKER That's me expressing my worry and asking you to take care of it. Yeah? 

02:59:45
 Yeah. 

02:59:45
CAITLIN WALKER So, if you can't do it cleanly the chances are, it's cuz you wanna do something that's to do with you and not to do with them. 

02:59:50
 Could, could you say-- I mean, is there anything else about - 

02:59:50
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

02:59:55
 - a diamond-shaped kite? 

02:59:55
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. 

03:00:00
 People said we've focusing on (inaudible ). 

03:00:03
CAITLIN WALKER If it doesn't come up, the chances are that's not what's important. 

03:00:05
 Hasn't got string just (inaudible ). It doesn't have a string. 

03:00:15
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, and it's -- what's really important to this exercise is you ask about every bit of the first (inaudible ). 

03:00:21
 And to answer by a question because when I answered that about the size or shape which is we don't know, uhm, we have some more effort to look on this (inaudible ) completely. 

03:00:30
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ). 

03:00:31
 The, the, the-- I wasn't (inaudible )then-- and then you can (inaudible ). 

03:00:37
 Ah... 

03:00:37
CAITLIN WALKER If one describe discuss somewhere else. 

03:00:40
 Yeah. 

03:00:40
 Yeah. 

03:00:40
CAITLIN WALKER Really not important. If you drop the ball and you're joking, you just pick it up and do it again and you can't move now what's the right-- it's even what kind that doesn't work for you, still ask it and find out with just a bit of people but (inaudible ) you got, uhm, what kind of if all of your concerns is in your voice, it'll be translated to the curiosity talking clique(ph). So, when you do ask them, (inaudible ). 

03:01:05
Modelling Time Future 

03:01:10
CAITLIN WALKER Thinking about the future, does the future have a size or a shape? Where is it? Whereabouts is it? What kind of future is it? A future is like what? And if you could point to the future, you point to it now and then look around the room. While pointing it to it, look at other people. 

03:02:00
[sil.] 

03:02:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay, and if you could show us the size or shape of the future now, just keep on showing it, just for a minute, let people see, yup, the direction and the size and shape of your future, lovely and then stop. 

03:02:25
Past 

03:02:30
CAITLIN WALKER What kind of past is it? A past is like what? And if you can point to your past now - 

03:02:50
[sil.] 

03:02:55
CAITLIN WALKER - and look around the room at the different locations of your past. The hands people are using to indicate it, the fingers, the shapes, and does that past have a size or shape, could you indicate the shape? 

03:03:15
[sil.] 

03:03:15
Present 

03:03:20
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Where is the present? Does it have a size or a shape? And indicate the present now and look around. Lovely. So what I'd like you to do now is take some paper and to make a map of the past, present and future in whatever way it makes the most sense. 

03:04:00
Mapping Time (conceptual maps) 

03:04:00
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ). So one of things I could do with this, (inaudible ) one of the things that's lovely about it and these are good on paper. Please look at that. (inaudible ) it's not really easy for all of you to see, okay. Could you see (inaudible ) to the edge of the paper? So, if you got that sort of a system and think of it as a system with patterns and awareness, really knows about but at least they put a piece of paper on the top and the bottom and go to the very edge of the (inaudible ) where there might some information that's in the system but you're not conscious of it yet. So, one of the things about mapping if you get whether this is project mapping or personal mapping is that it go to the edge of the paper. You can just, uhm-- David Grove (inaudible ) to it as a, a (inaudible ) inviting space. So, if you just put it up and go is there anything else and allow it to extend. 

03:05:10
 Just beautiful. 

03:05:10
CAITLIN WALKER Nice (inaudible ). 

03:05:12
 Yes. 

03:05:12
CAITLIN WALKER Other people that responds to that simply to mapping out your time. 

03:05:15
 For me, it is very clear, very concise I can see it all. It, it also plans(ph) so I can see when I was (inaudible ) like I can see now. For me, it's all very straightforward. 

03:05:35
 I can kind of relate to that. 

03:05:35
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:05:35
 Yeah, it's very straightforward. (inaudible ) back. 

03:05:40
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. 

03:05:40
 And I was really into (inaudible ). 

03:05:45
CAITLIN WALKER Umh-huh, whose got different experience again? Lovely. 

03:05:50
 Ah, for me, I was, ah, like surprised to how disconnected I was from a distant past and I know my distant past isn't that (inaudible ). Ah, my very distant past was just like a dot and it-- you know and they (inaudible ). They track down to it all and I thought it's a really rich, uhm, (inaudible ) distant past but our-- I've almost discounted. So it's an a bit, bit illuminating for me. 

03:06:15
CAITLIN WALKER Ah, somebody's do this exercise with some people who were gone through transition business and one of them said, "You know, I haven't realized that we're not changing jobs and I learned this. I disconnected everything I used to be and I realized now that all of that stuff now could be added in to what I do now." 

03:06:30
 Yeah, yeah. 

03:06:35
CAITLIN WALKER But I've never c-- caught up with myself. I was so busy learning something new, I left over that behind and she, she-- just by doing the exercise, she actually just-- it's almost, ah, re-amalgamation of who she was and who she is. As a business manager, she's all the flaw and, ah, and, ah, showiness of her old work now came into her business work. 

03:06:55
 Uhm, my experience is similar in the sense that I used to (inaudible ) at how my past is, uhm, af-- ah, I'd used to, I think having more focus on my-- I was a lot more focused on my past and past doesn't seem to be, uhm, something I focused on anymore as much. Uhm, I'm focusing a lot more on the future but the future seems very cloudy but the presence state felt a lot more important because that's where the change is happening and something about catching up with the creative part of me. I hadn't realized that disconnecting on completely, uhm, I'm been so focused on what can I learn to make things different from the past or learn from the past. So, I feel like I'm in this, uhm, really important phase of my life and I don't know what the future holds but just trust that it will work out okay. 

03:07:50
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, okay. So, the future is cloudy, we don't know what it holds and that present is what's the most important cuz you're in a really important phase of your life and there's a trust that it'll be okay. 

03:08:00
 Hm-huh. 

03:08:05
CAITLIN WALKER Good. 

03:08:05
 Mine was (inaudible ) I couldn't-- I was absorbed into the future that-- sorry, I was absorbed to, to the present completely (inaudible ) it was a, it was a -- it was now, it was immediate and the path was like, uhm, you know, when you look into something (inaudible ) like square box (inaudible ) smaller, smaller, smaller and the future was to say about future only when to the immediate future. There was nothing beyond that. There was notion of where I'll be in five years or it was (inaudible ) possibly on the Tuesday. Beyond that, there was nothing. 

03:08:55
CAITLIN WALKER So, just show me how far away tonight and the near future is. 

03:09:05
 It was all-- it was there for-- future from the past and it was like, it was like that. (inaudible ) and then with all of the traffic was absorbed around both the past and the future. I was able-- whether, whether it was a colored thing from the past even if like-- I would have just make the picture smaller and the future things were immediately big, (inaudible ). That's it. 

03:09:40
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Thank you. 

03:09:40
 It was just like... 

03:09:45
CAITLIN WALKER And, again, if you review about the five senses exercise, what I want you to consider is how will it change your reality, say if you had soem of those current model of your past, present, future? (inaudible ) or if you're really straightforward? It's just going from past to future "Tssk!" (inaudible ). 

03:10:07
Modelling a Positive State 

03:10:10
CAITLIN WALKER I'm gonna do-- or my job is standing up exercise and I'm going to ask her some questions and help her and I to find out how she becomes calm, that's all, and you could use this before an exam, you could it before (inaudible ) a piece of work, you could use it just for you to share joy of people, you know, having a, a positive state. 

03:10:35
 Before I launch in Saturday. 

03:10:40
CAITLIN WALKER Or before our launch on Saturday and where would like me cuz I could be anywhere. So I could be here, facing you, I could be here. Where would you like me to be so that it's-- I'm not in your way? 

03:10:50
 There, stay there. 

03:10:55
CAITLIN WALKER And whereabouts over here? 

03:10:55
 Great. 

03:10:55
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-huh, when your calm what kind of calm? I'm sorry, I'm sorry na-la-la just go straight in there. I want you to (inaudible ) doing with your piece of paper. So, what I'd like you to do with your piece of paper is I'd like you to make a map. So not-- a, a list of words and map or model of her being calm. It could diagrams, it can be bits coming off like a spider diagram, a mine map, it can be pictures of whatever symbols or words or written the words but I want you to keep track of what she's saying and start to build it up so that you can then compare with one another and say what do we know so far about her. So when you're calm, what kind of calm? 

03:11:50
 Tranquil. 

03:11:50
CAITLIN WALKER Hmm, and tranquil. Calm and tranquil and when calm, where is calm? 

03:12:05
 In, in the environment, in my back garden. It's got in here instead. 

03:12:10
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, and in the environment, in my back garden, but in here, it's there and when it's there like that, does it have a size or a shape? 

03:12:25
[sil.] 

03:12:30
 It's like, uhm, the rings around the planet. 

03:12:35
CAITLIN WALKER And it's like rings around a planet and it's there and calm and like in my back garden and calm and tranquil. And when tranquil, where is tranquil? 

03:13:00
[sil.] 

03:13:05
 Still in my back garden, sat on the bench. 

03:13:10
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm. 

03:13:10
 Listening to the birds. 

03:13:10
CAITLIN WALKER So, listen to the birds, sat on the bench, still in my back garden and calm is there and it's like the rings around the planet. And when calm, let the rings around the planet, where does calm like that come from? 

03:13:30
 Sun. 

03:13:30
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, what kind of sun? 

03:13:35
 Like crisp sun. 

03:13:40
CAITLIN WALKER And a bright, crisp sun and bright crisp sun, that calm comes from? And when bright crisp sun, is there anything else about the bright crisp of that sun? 

03:14:00
 It's warm on my face. 

03:14:00
CAITLIN WALKER It's warm on my face and calm and like the rings around the planet and when rings, is there anything else about those rings? 

03:14:15
 They move around like much secure-- security around. 

03:14:20
CAITLIN WALKER And then moving around me and secure like security around me, is there anything else about those rings moving around me? 

03:14:35
 It's protecting me. 

03:14:35
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, secure and moving around me and they're protecting me. And when they're protecting me, rings around the planet, is there anything else about the protecting of those rings? 

03:14:55
 I feel calm, I feel this, this is my space. No one is entering it. 

03:15:00
CAITLIN WALKER I feel calm, that it's my space and no one is entering it and they're protecting me and calm from a sun, bright crisp and I can feel it on my face and when calm like this and I feel safe and no one can come in my space then what happens? 

03:15:20
 I'm relaxed and I sigh. 

03:15:25
CAITLIN WALKER So, I'm relax and I sigh. 

03:15:30
 Deep breath. 

03:15:30
CAITLIN WALKER And then what happens after? 

03:15:35
[sil.] 

03:15:40
 I'm just at ease. 

03:15:40
CAITLIN WALKER And when I'm at ease like that, what happens next when I'm at ease? 

03:15:50
[sil.] 

03:15:55
 I don't know, I'm just, I'm just calm. 

03:15:55
CAITLIN WALKER And I'm just calm and at ease and rings around the planet and protecting me and sun that's bright and crisp and warm on my face and rings around the planet, when rings where do rings like that come from? 

03:16:20
 Deep inside. 

03:16:20
CAITLIN WALKER Uhm, deep inside and when deep inside, whereabouts deep inside? 

03:16:25
 Right here. 

03:16:30
CAITLIN WALKER And there does that deep inside have a size or a shape? 

03:16:35
 It's a little hazel nut. 

03:16:35
CAITLIN WALKER And it's a little hazel nut deep inside and what I'll do, I'm gonna stop there for a minute and what I'd like you to do is to make a map of this. 

03:16:50
 (inaudible ). 

03:17:00
Learning Point Systems, patterns and models Respecting the wisdom in the system 

03:17:05
CAITLIN WALKER A-- again, this was a big, big learning point for me. Got some kids in front of me, teach them spelling strategy and this was before I'd really knew about modelling and pattern systems. It was when I was just learning, so there's quite a lot of change work. A kid in front of me, he says and (inaudible ) before he was learning to spelling strategy, he could spell perfectly now. You give him basic text, he couldn't read any of it. (inaudible ) could you just be, be with me, what's going on? We're, we're teaching this kid and it's not working, what's happening? And so I said, "Oh, can you spell address?" He go, "a-d-d-r-e-s-s back was s-s-e-r-d-d-a, yeah." (inaudible ) show him the word address, he don't recognize it. "Don't know the word," he says. And then I'd said, "(inaudible ) cuz he spell it that way which I had not actually seen," and I realized (inaudible ). So, I'd show him the word first. I said, "That's the word you got to learn." He'd re-order it while it was in front of him. He re-ordered it b-e-c-a-u-s-e and yup, look him down. So, when you show me that way again later but don't tell him. He can't match them so I say to him (inaudible ) then now because it's where he was sat and then we know really happened. So I-- this-- I say oh, so work with, with (inaudible ) now so we point the letters and he went so it's b-e-c-a-u-s-e and I said, "What I want you to do is I just want you to open this up so you can put the let..." and he kicks up, kicks me over, just (inaudible ) out he goes, out the room. (inaudible ) "Whoa! You're in trouble now. Whoa!" I have no idea of what I've done. Can you give me sense now what I've done? If you think of it cuz you're probably clever than I was then. 

03:19:00
 Well, you have done something that he wanted to do so. 

03:19:00
CAITLIN WALKER Possibly. 

03:19:00
 That's like my student. It's like (inaudible ) to my kite. 

03:19:05
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:19:05
 Don't try to reorganize (inaudible ). 

03:19:07
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ). 

03:19:08
 (inaudible ). You gave him the solution instead of letting him to work with the solution himself. 

03:19:15
CAITLIN WALKER And the thousand things I thought, it was perfectly reasonable for me to restructure his system before I knew the wisdom of the system. So, when he comes back in it and it's three weeks before he comes back to the project and he says to me, "How could you do that? (inaudible ) how could you do that in front of all my mates? How could you, how could you make me..." and I said, "You know, I don't know what I did," and he said and turn my emotions with this and he said, "So, it's, it's-- no one else is around now but get chance to model this it's when it's like, it's like what?" He said, dif-- it's-- they're folded. Anything else about it when they're folded?" He said, "They're curtains." What kind of curtains? The curtains are eyes behind and I go, "And what kind of eye is that eye?" "It's a little eye." "Is there anything else about that little eye?" I'm six and as a six hiding on the curtains sending us for their hiding and trying to keep and I know this is not quite his words but it's, uhm, I'm watching but I'm trying to keep myself safe on watching. And then, the curtains you hid behind when his dad was beating up his mom and he's to watch like that and now he hasn't got anywhere else to look because he can't open that arch cuz he can only stay there. 

03:20:25
 Yes. 

03:20:25
CAITLIN WALKER He's bright as a (inaudible ) and he can't learn to read cuz reading takes space and you know, geez! And you think, "Why on earth why I wander in there and try and pull that," and you really think about it like that. And so, that's-- that was a biggest learning for me with the kids and I just stop then. Oh, there was that and then there was and-- it was the same like and then the black and white and, and the color and stuff but so, different question was now that we know about your system, now we've done a bit of the model, we know a bit about your system to learn to read, I need you to get this word, this very round into your head so you can read it. I said (inaudible ) we could do it really small but close up. It's right, is there anything else about that? Yeah, (inaudible ) it will be how to keep it there. So, it's okay, when it be how to keep it there, what would you like to happen? Can I chisel it? But we'll take a really fine chiselness(ph) and we can have really fine chisel and he sat and chiseled his words very small up. He said, "Like on a cave, Miss." I said, "Yup, like on a cave. That's fine." And he did this for however long until he started to learn to read until his brain did it automatically. But it was a really big (inaudible ) of a system, don't go messing around when you don't know what you're up with. When he's doing a beautiful job of staying sane, you know, you're just managing but, you know, I don't. So, so that, that's-- I guess, so the system is all the stuff I couldn't see yet and didn't know how to work with it appropriately. A model would be (inaudible ) to replicate one symptom or one scale so I can replicate it. The system is the reason behind how it's organized. I mean, it's-- yeah. And then patterns are-- as you start to detect things you think, "Oh, that's happened again, that's happened again and the pattern builds into a model and if you get enough models of the same person, so one of the things I'm gonna get-- I want you to get at least two days is a few models of yourself. So, you start on the standard nature of your system, how you organize and that's as an individual. If you were a team and this was a business training about a business team, we get a model, a model, a model, a model, a model, a model, a model. 

03:22:40
 Coming out in between different models. 

03:22:40
CAITLIN WALKER And who's got a conflict and who's not and how will you have to adjust to work together. Yeah. 

03:22:50
Clean Start Modelling an Outcome 

03:22:50
 This is what (inaudible ) if it's okay. (inaudible ). That, that would be a sort of (inaudible ). 

03:23:08
CAITLIN WALKER Hmm. And we won’t' get it there? 

03:23:10
 On the (inaudible [03:23:15) house. 

03:23:10
CAITLIN WALKER Let's try that. 

03:23:10
 (inaudible ). 

03:23:19
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ) out, what are the things when you're working on space is not to help people? Uhm, but just to let them sort themselves out. You know, yeah, sometimes I have somebody say, "Well, it's kinda behind that door but then I won't be able to see it," and here's somebody very well meaningly will say, "Well, I'll hold it for you. I'll hold (inaudible ). Hang on a minute." They put themselves here, their outcome behind that door, you know, ah, space becomes kind of interesting. 

03:23:50
 That's okay? 

03:23:55
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah. If you got some time would you like it to be-- ah, ah, it's at the right height? 

03:24:00
 Ah, a little bit higher actually. 

03:24:05
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Could have it down so we can find. 

03:24:10
 Our box are here. 

03:24:15
 Oh, problem? 

03:24:20
CAITLIN WALKER And again you can do this as touch your feeling way out that you like. You can set up a space, you can get children cutting your stuff up, you can get adults making things, you can get play dough or if that's not what suits your industry... 

03:24:35
 That's it. It's the last props. 

03:24:35
CAITLIN WALKER If it doesn't what suits your industry, don't do it, keep it, you know, make them-- don't stay like that. Just say put it up on the wall. Yeah, if you haven't got, it it's not appropriate-- the reports most important, if it's not appropriate in your world to have people doing stuff like this don't, don't do it. But, but the t-- the principles still. 

03:25:00
[sil.] 

03:25:00
 (inaudible ). Let's start, yeah. 

03:25:10
CAITLIN WALKER Let's check. 

03:25:15
 Yeah. 

03:25:20
CAITLIN WALKER And some really simple questions, we just getting this from David Grove, ah, and is that in the right space? 

03:25:25
 Yes. 

03:25:25
CAITLIN WALKER And are you in the right space? 

03:25:35
 Yes. 

03:25:35
CAITLIN WALKER And is that at the right height? 

03:25:35
 Yeah. 

03:25:40
CAITLIN WALKER And are you at the right height? 

03:25:40
 Yeah. 

03:25:45
CAITLIN WALKER And is that the right amount of space between you and it? 

03:25:50
[sil.] 

03:25:55
 Yeah. 

03:26:00
CAITLIN WALKER Now, again, just very simply cuz you suggested it. All the things might have adjusted so just go through it again. And is that in the right space? 

03:26:05
 Yes. 

03:26:05
CAITLIN WALKER And are you in the right space? 

03:26:10
 Yeah. 

03:26:10
CAITLIN WALKER Is that at the right height? 

03:26:10
 Yeah. 

03:26:10
CAITLIN WALKER And are you at the right height? 

03:26:15
 Yeah. 

03:26:15
CAITLIN WALKER Is that the right am-- amount of space between you and it? 

03:26:20
 Yeah. 

03:26:20
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Hmm, just give a little respect to, to the space. And what would you like to have happen? 

03:26:35
 So that's the outcome, uhm, but what's written on here to, to become real. 

03:26:45
CAITLIN WALKER And what's written on here to become real? And that's-- what is written on here that's like what? 

03:27:00
[sil.] 

03:27:05
 It's, it's like the whole-- encapsulates the whole of the future for me. 

03:27:15
CAITLIN WALKER So, encapsulates the whole of the future for me. And for what's written on here to become real. Is there anything else about encapsulates the whole future for me? 

03:27:35
[sil.] 

03:27:45
 I know it but I can't see it. 

03:27:50
CAITLIN WALKER And I know it but I can't see it. So, we're just gonna stop him now, I'm going to take you to the process of what we know is. Doesn't it that encapsulates the whole future for him. He knows it but he can't see it and he wants it become real. So, we know that it exist-- so, uhm, what are, what are the things about modellings, what do we already know about this? So, we know it exist but it exist in some format that isn't real form. We know that he knows it, we don't where he knows it, how he knows it, what the kind of knowing it is and he can't see it. There are lots of ways of not being able to see something. So we could say when you can't see it you can't see it like what? When you know it, where do you know it? What kind of know, does that know have a size or shape? Or when you know it but you can't see it, whereabouts is it? Could this-- could you just say-- there's a thousand ways I can go just at the minute. So, one of the things I'd like you to do is to track either in space or in paper just what I'm working and build up the model. And then you could be my co-therapist so I can say, "Well, okay, what could we do next?" 

03:29:10
 I know I need to do this. 

03:29:10
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, yeah. Stop any of that transformation stuff when you're over there and then that insight so we'll have no, we'll have no three questions and it will change it. Okay. 

03:29:25
 We'll probably the next thing I need (inaudible ). 

03:29:30
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-huh. Right, get them. 

03:29:40
 I need to put this over there. 

03:29:40
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-huh. 

03:29:40
 Cuz I wanna see and get this down there. 

03:29:45
[sil.] 

03:30:00
CAITLIN WALKER And can those of you who are involved in business rather than training cuz I do this in business a lot. It is the first job to fill(ph) metaphors at work in joint metaphor process. This happens don't-- and, and people think nothing of it so if, you know, if you always (inaudible ) and you start asking a few questions and suddenly people just like yeah, yeah, whatever. And here in the projects here and it fits in like this and the people do is just spontaneously view things. So, let just start again now. And is that in the right space? 

03:30:30
 Yeah. 

03:30:30
CAITLIN WALKER And are you in the right space.? 

03:30:35
 Yeah. 

03:30:40
CAITLIN WALKER And is that at the right height? 

03:30:40
 Yeah. 

03:30:40
CAITLIN WALKER And are you at the right height? 

03:30:40
 Yeah. 

03:30:45
CAITLIN WALKER And is that the right amount of space between you and it? 

03:30:45
 Hm-huh. 

03:30:50
CAITLIN WALKER And what would you like to have happen? 

03:30:55
[sil.] 

03:31:00
 If this happens, it will happen. 

03:31:05
CAITLIN WALKER That this happens, it will happen. And when that this happens, what kind of happens? 

03:31:20
[sil.] 

03:31:25
 It'll happen very easily without painstaking effort with effort which is positive and what is it-- without knowing it, it's just gonna happen anyway. 

03:31:45
CAITLIN WALKER So, just happens without a painstaking effort and knowing that it's just gonna happen anyway and knowing it's just gonna happen and when knowing, what kind of knowing is that? 

03:32:00
 It's very warm and, solid confidence. 

03:32:10
CAITLIN WALKER And warm and solid confidence. And when warm and solid, that's warm and solid like what? 

03:32:30
[sil.] 

03:32:35
 It's like protection, it's like soft like mattresses protecting you all around. 

03:32:45
CAITLIN WALKER And like protection, like soft mattresses protecting me all the way around, knowing it's gonna happen anyway, and when protection like soft mattresses, where does protection like that come from? 

03:33:05
 Here. 

03:33:10
CAITLIN WALKER And whereabouts here? 

03:33:15
 Starts deep inside and it sort of spreads out (inaudible ) like a spiral. 

03:33:20
CAITLIN WALKER And starts deep inside and spreads out like a spiral and when starts deep inside, does deep inside have a size or a shape? 

03:33:35
 It's quite small, like pea sized. 

03:33:45
CAITLIN WALKER And it's quite small, deep inside and it's quite small pea sized and deep inside is like what? 

03:34:00
 Strength. 

03:34:05
CAITLIN WALKER And strength and what kind of strength? 

03:34:15
 It's an inner strength which is-- that keeps, ah, balanced. 

03:34:20
CAITLIN WALKER An inner strength that keeps me balanced, an inner strength starts deep inside and out like a spiral and protection like soft mattresses all around and knowing it's going to happen anyway. When knowing it's going to happen anyway and to happen, is there anything else about happen? 

03:35:05
[sil.] 

03:35:10
 I can see and feel it now. 

03:35:10
CAITLIN WALKER And I can see and feel it now. 

03:35:15
 And hear it. 

03:35:15
CAITLIN WALKER And hear it and as I can see it and hear it and feel it now, is there anything else about it? 

03:35:30
[sil.] 

03:35:40
 It's more focused, it's more-- although it's going to be the whole of everything. I mean, it's being along pointed and focused in the way that I make it happen. 

03:35:55
CAITLIN WALKER And although it's going to be the whole of everything I need to be more pointed and focused and as I need to be more pointed and focused, is there anything else about that need to be? 

03:36:15
[sil.] 

03:36:20
 No. 

03:36:20
CAITLIN WALKER Take a bit of time to find out some more about pointed and focused while I talk to the rest of the group. So what, what have you got, what are you noticing? 

03:36:40
 Uhm, wherever he moved to it is important to check that everything was in the right, in the right place because when he move, everything also changed. So, we'll have to start again, really. 

03:36:55
CAITLIN WALKER Hmm, and it takes nothing to just... 

03:36:55
 Uhm, well that was a very important element. This-- it's getting through strike. 

03:37:05
CAITLIN WALKER And he still have little adjustments, didn't he? 

03:37:05
 And it feel just right. 

03:37:10
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:37:10
 (inaudible ) to see it cuz he (inaudible ). 

03:37:16
CAITLIN WALKER Yup. I think of that little clean start a bit like the setting states thing the-- I'd ask you to do yesterday when we very first start. It's just that intention, takes no time and just to check what you want thing to be like, what do you want to be like. It's just why not take a moment to, to think about what it is you're here for and what you want to have happen. 

03:37:40
 I find it quite difficult to stay with this words and remember them all as a sequence that you remember (inaudible ) and I'm going to writing them, then I'll become so focused on the writing and forget about him. 

03:37:50
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely and you are no-- so, so not on your own. 

03:37:55
Learning Point Projecting your model onto other people 

03:38:00
 I, I sensed from Allan(ph) that the penny dropped to that process and it was to do... 

03:38:10
CAITLIN WALKER Just, just keep-- don't, don't check for confirmation then. 

03:38:10
 Sorry. 

03:38:10
CAITLIN WALKER Yeah, because all the time we're doing this remember... 

03:38:20
 Okay. 

03:38:20
CAITLIN WALKER Yup, that penny dropping (inaudible ) to have said this has to be (inaudible ) to have penny dropping moments. 

03:38:30
Learning Point Self Modelling 

03:38:35
 I've learned that I really like the kite flying, create(ph) it if some tossed a string on and probably be somewhere where I don't want to be. I feel then, I get frustrated but the (inaudible ) when I'm learning. So it's important to me like the way that you used, uhm, introduce this clean language, how you built up that, that's been important to have that structure and that in a way I work on that, I use that as well. 

03:39:00
CAITLIN WALKER Okay. Lovely, so not knowing that, recognizing that again that you hate to have you somebody pull you where you don't wanna go and yet you need structure when you're learning. 

03:39:10
 Yes. 

03:39:10
CAITLIN WALKER What difference will that made to you? 

03:39:20
 That I need to stress out. I need to be aware of where it might be the someone talking on the street. 

03:39:25
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:39:25
 And as well as if they give me some sort of instruction and made me that it's kind of a good thing and then, I need to make sure they let me go and not hold me back because of that. 

03:39:35
CAITLIN WALKER Lovely. Anyone else? 

03:39:40
[sil.] 

03:39:40
CAITLIN WALKER (inaudible ) sharing of moment it's just-- it's as if, if anyone else got anything that notice about themselves. 

03:39:50
 I, uhm, I use to have a, a belief in the change process being developed through rapport and development of respectful relationships and about individuals facilitating a change process, uhm, which I'm not questioning because clean language really does empower the explorer more than the guide and I've, I'd, you know, I, I think, uhm, human beings stay the same because it serves them and I think I have them being served through my giving and I'm not, I'm not seeing it as serving me. 

03:40:55
Learning Point From contempt to curiosity The background to modelling negative states 

03:41:00
CAITLIN WALKER So, when I was first doing this good bunch of about this many young people. Ah, so, worst behaved young people in one of the worst schools in (inaudible ) at the time and my job was to teach to read and write (inaudible ) project. Now, I got no relationship with you and you got no relationship with each other, you're the worst kids in the school and you're in one room now in one year. So, after this, I've gone to each of you in your own and I said, "What I do-- so I'm a brain coach. My job is to help you to find out what you like and when you know more about what you like, you got more choice about it and I just-- let me just explain that. Some of you here get into trouble, some of you here get into fights. Now, I'm not saying don't get into fights but you sometimes you get into fights that you don't even wanna get into. So, what if you get-- only get into the fights that you want to get into and you had some choice about that, would that be useful? Some of you here get so frustrated when you're trying to learn something, you can't even learn it. So, what if I could help you get your frustration to control so when you want to learn something, you can. You don't learn something, you don't learn it. Some of you got brilliant skills, what if I could help you find out how you do it and then you could show it with other people that you could be the teacher and teach people what you're good at." So that's how I started it. Getting them all together, so tell them then turn up and I go, "All right, who here hits someone in this week?" (inaudible ) and someone says, "No, I haven't-- never hit anyone." And the rest said, "Yeah, he doesn't." I said, "Okay. So, how do you know you're gonna hit someone?" One said, (inaudible ) so you go and some of you, some of you heard-- have heard the story before and that's fine, now you've, you've were fitted in because it's I'm not gonna get you to do it to one another and others of you haven't cuz it was a—bit(ph) gonna keen with his love to us at the first start of this. So you can read. Okay, and he's just done that. So, who doesn't do that? Oh, me, what do you do? He goes quiet. All right, he goes quiet, goes red, he doesn't do either of those things. I don't know I'd-- didn't do any of those, Miss. Just, just happens like that, just switch. As you switch, okay, so when you go red, what kind of red and he didn't-- he's English was very poor at that time. What kind of red? Blood red. All right, so you go blood red. Before you're blood red, what's it like before you're blood red? He looked around. Didn't know the word for it. So, he points in a room, he says, "That, Miss." I said, "All right, so it's there. And before it's, before it's that-- there, what it's like before it's there? Where does that come from?" He says, "That's purple." "So, all right. So, it's purple. What about before it's purple?" He goes, "Wooosh! It's blue like the sky, like my mom." I said, "All right. (inaudible ) quiet." "So, what's it like before it's quiet?" "I don't know, Miss." I said, "It goes quiet, is there anything else about it when it goes quiet like that?" " I do-- I don't know." "So, what kind of is that?" "We either like we got headphones on." "So, it was like you got headphones on, then what happens?" "Well, it's like everything just goes like that and then before you know it, it's there on the ground." I said, "All right. Okay. So, it goes really quiet then everything goes like that. Great. What about you?" (inaudible ) down the streets then what happens? I'll just switch. I said, "All right, who noticed what he did just before he switched?" "Oh, I lean back." I said, "All right. So, let's find out what (inaudible ) and find out what that is." "So what kind of is that?" "(inaudible ) they'll give you a look." "Aha, so they'll give you a look. So, when they give you a look, then what happens just before you switch?" Well, it goes right in you and it goes right in you like what and that's all we're doing. Check out to that, check out that it, this kid here I go. So it's, I said it goes blue. So when you're getting angry, what happens to that blue as you're getting angry? So now you get, you get a reaction that's not true. When somebody is around back of bit, back of bit. So what happens just before you switch, uhm, well, I'm just walking down the road. So then, because you look goes like this, comes out. Yeah and instead, then instead faster and it takes ages to come down. The kid doesn't get in to fights, he said, "No, I never get to fights." So, when does the fight kicking off? What happens? He said, "I don't know. I just get out there." So, just before you get out there, what happens? He said, "I don't know." So, he don't know and anything else when you try to get out there cuz when, when this kicks off stuff as he said, I'm just gone. I said, "Who knows who-- which who knows which be able to knows how to get out there?" Oh, (inaudible ). Okay, and he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." He said, "Yeah, I just take off." I said, "Okay, you just take off." First session, I've to go and I think I'm gonna get sucked cuz I didn't do any baseline assessments or literacy assessments and that-- that's why I'd been told to do. I thought, no. (inaudible ), come back next session, that kid comes in and he says, "Yeah, I know the stuff you're saying, Miss. We'll get up in the morning, my dad is drunk, red. And my clothes stink cuz they haven't been cleaned (inaudible ) for the laundry. So, I got put (inaudible ) and then smell, red and I'm getting to eat red and I haven't got enough money for the bus, I'm gonna be late, red. So, on my way to school, I already know I'm in for a detention. So, I get to the front of the school and I'm already here, Miss. Is that why you hit people? And he go, I don't know but that seems reasonable. Bit of time with everyone else, a bit modelling, a bit modelling about this, a bit modelling about that, get small models from the kids and he says, "What I was thinking, Miss, was when I go to school if I know I'm gonna be late, I could go to (inaudible ) duck pond and I could look at the ducks in the water and think of my mom and I could breathe in blue and then I'll be purple. So when I go to school then I'll be purple and know I don't hit people then. (inaudible ) work, Miss. And I'd go, I don't know but there's no way I would have predicted that. No anger management course I know. 

03:46:55
 (inaudible ) duck pond. 

03:47:00
CAITLIN WALKER Breathing in blue by the, the duck pond and then once he had one, of course, they all wanted one. And then once he had one, of course, they all wanted one. And then once they all wanted a model their tempers and how to manage it, it was nothing to then go, could you do it (inaudible ), Miss? What you mean now, when I'm trying that up, it all jumbles up. I don't know. Who here can add up? Let's find out how do you add up, how do you add up, how do you add up? And before you know it, you've got self-modeling system when nothing they do is a problem. Everything they do is interesting, it's just stuff and without no time at all, they're telling me, "Oh, Miss, stop speaking so fast. Liam(ph) can't understand you when you're speaking that fast. He said that, all right, twice now, Miss. Is that a pattern?" 

03:47:45
Learning Point Self modelling 

03:47:45
 (inaudible ) about the quiet room before but what came to me is-- are the feeling here that I didn't almost realized that I have before so we (inaudible ). 

03:48:02
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:48:02
 I have now a, a great understanding on how to stop it from that-- it's that-- it was the trigger an I thought it was the trigger before I actually (inaudible ) something else. 

03:48:10
CAITLIN WALKER Hm-huh. 

03:48:10
 (inaudible ) very light sensation with my jaw here, well in that area. And then (inaudible ) it's been happen he haven't (inaudible ) your eyes but it, and the metaphor of my anger was just like wild tigers so that was quite interesting. 

03:48:35
CAITLIN WALKER Uh-hmm. Great. I notice with Carl(ph) that he said so-- (inaudible ) people notice it, he said just read my body language for us they who saying now it read-- it's not become to. 

03:48:55
 People tell me as we all round up and, and and I know I was but I don't know what signals I give, ah, with other people around. 

03:49:05
CAITLIN WALKER David - 

03:49:05
 Is it useful? 

03:49:05
CAITLIN WALKER David Grove has a lovely thing for this. He says, "Your metaphors mediate between your conscious and your unconscious." They, ah, the, the bridge that what is known and unknown and then I guess that's very much for his work and in my work metaphors mediate between your conscious and unconscious but also between the different people. The different systems (inaudible ) company.
