AUTISM + ME 

00:00:00
A FILM BY: RORY HOY 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN Autism. What is it? It can be defined by comparing neurotypical(ph) or non-autistic people with the con- 

00:01:05
RORY HOY What? I think you might be trying to tell us something. The difference between normal people and autistic people is that normal people have divided attention but autistic people only have single attention. That means you can do and think many things at the same time. But we become absorbed by one thing. And we devote our entire attention to it. This film is to help all other(ph) young autistic people like me. Their friends, their families, their schools, whoever you can think of. Their children, their grandchildren, their grandchildren's children, their grandchildren's children's children, their grandchildren' children's children's childrens, and so on, and so on, and so on. By the time this film has finished, I think you'll have a better understanding of autism. Come into my world and see what it's like. Shh.

00:02:15
Teach Me 

00:02:15
RORY HOY When I was a lad, people used to think I couldn't hear. No matter how loud the noise was, I wouldn't turn around. I was absorbed in my own world. Do you know why I didn't turn around? This wasn't a normal reaction for me. I needed to be taught that you had to react. This is another example. I didn't know when someone waved to you, you had to wave back. It wasn't a normal reaction for me. My mom and dad had to teach me over and over again. Mom and Dad say they still feel thrilled when I do this. I've learned to wave back to them, simple for you normal guys, but these things we need to learn. Now I'm here on this side of the road. I need to get to the other side, but this is a really difficult thing for me to do. I'm not always traffic aware. I can get distracted by a car's number plate or the noise or other people around me. You need to be very patient and teach me to cross safely. This is really important. Here I am in the big city. It is very loud and it's very noisy. Crowds are difficult for me. It's a fact. People come at you in all directions. It makes me(ph) feel nervous and insecure. 

00:04:00

00:04:20
RORY HOY Hello. I've woken up, I've got dressed, I've combed my hair, and now I'm going to brush my teeth. Normal people know exactly what to do, but I had to be taught all these things. But not just for a few years when I was young, but for a very long time. It's like having a blank page in front of you every day. No writing, no clues, nothing to read. You must help us. 

00:04:55
[music] 

00:04:55
Routine 

00:05:10
RORY HOY I love routine but I hate surprises. If things were a organized as this time table, it would be great. It is very easy to be distracted in strange surroundings. There are so many bicycles in the world, but the questions is, which is the right one to ride? That's the right one for me. 

00:05:35
Explain 

00:05:40
RORY HOY You need to explain everything to us. Thing that you might take for granted, we need to have it spelled out to us. Here is an example. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Hey Rory, you can't eat that. 

00:05:55
RORY HOY What's she talking about? I've already eaten some of it. What she means is, I shouldn't be having that now because I'll be having my lunch soon. But if that's what she meant, that's what she should say. Here's another thing she might say. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Rory, we have to go to the shops. 

00:06:20
RORY HOY What she needs to say is, when are we coming out, when are we going it, what are we gonna buy? All these things, we need this to be explained to us. Nowadays, I know what she means by that, but in the old days I would panic. But this is what she should have said. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Rory, shall we go to the shop and buy you a new t-shirt? When we've done that, we'll get back in the car and come home. 

00:06:45
RORY HOY That's better. 

00:06:50
[music] 

00:06:50
RORY HOY We have to learn what's called socially acceptable behavior. For example, I've just received a present. Thank you very much. Wait a minute. I've already go this. That's what an autistic person would say. 

00:07:10
We always have to tell the truth! 

00:07:15
RORY HOY But I'm learning to be more like this. Thank you.Thank you very much. I can change in the shops later. 

00:07:30
[music] 

00:07:30
Taking things Literally 

00:07:40
RORY HOY Autistic people take things literally. Normal guys say some really weird things. How about, it's raining cats and dogs. Wait a minute. We don't see any cat's and dogs. Another example is, pull your socks up. Do you really have to pull your socks? Just because this is an apple doesn't mean it's an apple tree. I am going to tell you a couple of funny things which happened to me when I was at school. An example of this, the teacher would say to me, Rory, what's the biggest number? But I would say, but teacher, there isn't a bigger number. They're all the same size. And another thing the teacher would say, class, write down the days of the week. This is what everyone else wrote. 

00:08:35
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 

00:08:40
RORY HOY Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, etc. 

00:08:40
The days of the week. 

00:08:40
RORY HOY But I would write, The days of the week. Funny, eh. 

00:08:50
Changes 

00:08:55
RORY HOY Autistic people hate change. We love routine. We can panic and become frightened at change. This is an example. Here's my cousin Mike. I know it's him because I see him a lot, but if he puts on sunglasses, I don't recognize him anymore. Is it still Mike or is it a stranger? 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Sometimes autistic people can seem to be aggressive. They can lash out without really understanding what they're doing. 

00:09:25
RORY HOY We get confused. Then fearful. Anxious. Then highly stressed. It is only because we can't cope and we don't understand our feelings. That last bit got a bit heavy. Let's move on to something lighter. 

00:09:45
Conversation 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN So Mike, have you got anything planned for the weekend? 

00:09:50
MIKE Yeah. I'm going to go to Leeds I think. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN Oh. Good. Are you going to buy anything? 

00:09:55
MIKE Um. I might do. Yes. I'll have a look around. 

00:09:55
UNKNWON Good. (inaudible ). 

00:09:58
RORY HOY (crosstalk) Guys, have you seen what's on my iPod? 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Rory, we were chatting. 

00:10:00
RORY HOY It's because I'm not following what they're saying. I'm concentrating on what I want to tell them. Sometimes it's difficult to know what people mean because I don't always understand the tone of their voice. 

00:10:15
Obsessions 

00:10:20
RORY HOY Anyway, we're on to the next heading, which is one of my favorites. Did you know that obsessions are the most important things in an autistic person's entire life. Apart from Mom, Dad, friends of course. When I was a wee lad, I used to collect many weird things including soap powder(ph). It must have been impossible for my mom and dad, but they went with me and understood me. 

00:10:55
[music] 

00:11:05
RORY HOY We rely so much on our interests and obsessions to make our lives happy. If you take them away, we have nothing. When I do have an obsession, I seem to talk about it over, and over, and over, and over again. 

00:11:30
[music] 

00:11:30
'The other Me' 

00:11:40
RORY HOY This is my school. It's lovely and quite. No one around to distract you. 

00:11:45
Until... 

00:11:45
RORY HOY Until break time. People rush you(ph) around. Busy corridors. School life can be difficult for me sometimes. My(ph) school is great. The teachers, the friends, the lessons. But it can be very difficult for a boy like me sometimes. I find it hard to listen and make notes at the same time. I also find it difficult to cope with changes in the time table, stand-in teachers, unexpected fire drills. It's a shame because I feel I'm the other me at school. It's hard to feel like the real me. But I do my best. 

00:12:35
Random Thoughts 

00:12:40
[music] 

00:12:45
RORY HOY It is a common fact that autistic people have an exaggerated sense of smell, taste, and hearing. I just don't get it. For example, oh it's great. Well it could really mean, oh it's awful. It could mean vice-versa. 

00:13:10
[music] 

00:13:15
RORY HOY Sometimes when I'm in a public place I speak in an inappropriate volume. When I was a wee lad, I hated having my hair cut. And night when I was asleep my dad had to do it for me. It is very annoying when people rearrange my belongings. It really helps me if the people around me are calm and happy. I'm quite(ph) uncomfortable being in unfamiliar surroundings. I don't like to have physical contact whit people who I'm not familiar with. I love dogs but the problem is their behavior is very unpredictable and I can find them frightening sometimes. We autistic guys like to do many strange things, like flap our arms, rock, or hum. It's just our way of coping. But you normal guys do weird things like playing with your hair or scrunching(ph) of(ph) your(ph) teeth. When I meet people in the streets, I'm never sure how to react to them. 

00:14:30
[music] 

00:14:45
RORY HOY Oh dear, oh deary me. We all respond in a positive way when people give us praise. 

00:14:50
ACCEPTED 

00:14:55
RORY HOY And we all need to feel accepted. 

00:14:55
PROTECTED 

00:14:55
RORY HOY Protected. 

00:14:55
RESPECTED 

00:15:00
RORY HOY Respected. But most of all, we need to be loved. And now you've had a glimpse into my world. It's a bit different from yours. But if we work together, we can achieve great things.
