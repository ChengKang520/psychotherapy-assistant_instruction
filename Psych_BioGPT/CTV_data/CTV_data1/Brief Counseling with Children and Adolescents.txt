BRIEF COUNSELING WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS John M. Littrell, Ed.D. Kirk Zinck, M.A. 

00:00:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Welcome to this brief counseling videotape. I'm John Littrell and I'm counsel educator and counselor at Iowa State University. I'm also the program coordinator for our school counseling program: a program very similar to the one that you'll be seeing here; and that it's solution-focused brief counseling. Over the years, I've been fascinated with how we speed up process of change. How do we help students make changes in the least amount of time? I've wrestled with this problem because school counselors face a serious problem, a lack of time to help students. We're expected to assist so many students in so little time. We need brief counseling in our repertoire to be able to assist these student's. 

00:01:05
Brief Counseling with Children and Adolescents 

00:01:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  I believe the brief counseling is an extremely valuable set of tools to have in a counselor's repertoire. I caution that brief counseling is but one set of tools. Used appropriately, brief counseling can help student's, but it is not the answer. In this video, we will be presenting ways to help you shorten the time that you work with student's. The videotape contains three parts. 

00:01:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL In Part 1, eight characteristics of brief counseling will be presented. In part 2, I'll go through the Four-Step Brief Counseling Model presented by the Mental Research Institute or MRI of Palo Alto, California. I'll also explain brief counseling techniques developed by Steve De Shazer and his associates in Milwaukee. 

00:01:55
Part 3: Two Brief Counseling Cases: 1. An Expert in Self-Defeating Behavior 2. Tug of War in My Head 

00:01:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL In part three, you'll watch re-enactments of two detailed cases. The first case with a tenth grader is called An Expert in Self-Defeating Behaviors. The second case with a fifth grade student is called Tug of War Inside My Head. Each case includes captions that identify segments, illustrating the eight brief counseling characteristics. Also, identified will be specific types of brief counseling techniques. In addition, I'll break in from time to time and be presenting an in-depth commentary about specific things that are happening. In addition to this videotape, there are materials to read and questions to answer. 

00:02:45
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 

00:02:45
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 1. Relationship-Based 

00:02:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL To begin, brief counseling has eight defining characteristics. The first is relationship-based. Brief counselors are first and foremost concerned with establishing a working relationship with their students. The most effective brief counseling is relationship-based, warmth and caring, genuineness, empathy. These form of solid foundation for any type of counseling. First, brief counselors care about the people who they work with. Second, brief counselors are real. They don't hide behind techniques. And third, brief counselors hear what their students have to say. They have empathy. 

00:03:25
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 2. Time-Limited 

00:03:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counseling is also time-limited. Much can be accomplished in a very short period of time. Brief counseling can range from five minutes to five sessions, but we find that, often, one session is quite sufficient. 

00:03:40
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 3. Solution-Focused 

00:03:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counselors work with student's that help them find solutions. They don't dwell on problems, that which doesn't work. Rather, they focus on student's strengths and student's resources. 

00:03:55
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 4. Action Based 

00:03:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counseling is also action-based. Brief counselors get students doing something different so as to break self-defeating patterns. Tasks are often assigned so as to get students doing something different in an action sort of way. 

00:04:10
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 5. Socially Interactive 

00:04:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Students are social beings, so brief counselors involve others who can assist students in making the changes that they desire. 

00:04:20
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 6. Detail-Oriented 

00:04:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counseling is detail-oriented. Instead of collecting detailed information about what doesn't work, brief counselors explore in detail student's goals, their strengths and resources, and ways to reach their goals. 

00:04:35
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 7. Humor-Eliciting 

00:04:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counseling is also humor-eliciting. Even with serious problems, brief counselors elicit student's sense of humor to make change fun. 

00:04:45
Eight Characteristics of Brief Counseling 8. Developmentally and Culturally Attentive 

00:04:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Finally, brief counseling is developmental and culturally attentive. Brief counselors understand that most problems are developmental in nature and the clients are highly influenced by their cultural backgrounds. Thus, brief counselors are sensitive to both the similarities and the uniquenesses of individuals and their problems, as well as their idiosyncratic solutions. 

00:05:10
Part 2: Brief Counseling Model 

00:05:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Brief Counseling Model used in the cases you will see, it was developed by the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, California. In addition, we have added new techniques in brief counseling developed by Steve De Shazer and his associates in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

00:05:30
Four-Step Brief Counseling Model 1. Defining the Problem 

00:05:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL The MRI or Mental Research Institute Model has four steps. The first, defining the problem. Many students like to begin by telling us about their problems. In brief counseling, we do not discourage this. On the other hand, we do not spend much time engaged in problem talk. We go for clarity about the problem situation, but not exhaustive detail and exploration. 

00:05:55
Four-Step Brief Counseling Model 2. Exploring Attempted Solutions and Finding Exceptions 

00:05:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL  The second step is to explore student's attempted solutions. What have they tried so far? We also explore exceptions to the problem. When is it not a problem? 

00:06:10
Four-Step Brief Counseling Model 3. Setting a Goal 

00:06:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL The third step in the MRI model is setting a goal. We help students to figure out what it is that they want. We ask questions, such as, how would you know if these were not a problem? What would be different? What is it that you want? 

00:06:25
Four-Step Brief Counseling Model Miracle Question 

00:06:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Sometimes we ask Steve De Shazers' miracle question. If you were to wake up tomorrow and a miracle had occurred, what would be the first thing you'd notice about yourself that would tell you that you were on the right track? 

00:06:45
Four-Step Brief Counseling Model 4. Generating Ways to Reach the Goal 

00:06:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL The fourth step in the MRI model is generating ways to reach a goal. We help students reach goals that they have set. We brainstorm new patterns of behavior, and sometimes we get student's task as a way of reaching the goal that they've set. For instance, the task might be, based on what you've told me, and based on your willingness to do something about this concern; I think that you should do something quite different as a way of reaching your goal. What would be some fun, interesting and exciting ways to begin reaching your goal? 

00:07:20
Expert in Self-Defeating Behavior 

00:07:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  In the first case entitled, Expert in Self-Defeating Behavior, we meet the counselor, Kirk Zinck. Kirk is an experienced secondary school counselor of 18 years experience. He will be helping Laura, a ninth grader, and her mother, to be able to deal with the issue of Laura's sliding grades. In the first scene, we see Laura's mother explaining the situation to Kirk. In the second scene, Kirk meets with Laura and engages in a brief counseling session. The third scene is a follow up to that session, and the fourth scene, we once again see Kirk talking with Laura's mother. 

00:08:00
Precounseling Session with Laura's Mother 

00:08:00
KIRK ZINCK Hi, Mrs. Randall. How can I help you today? 

00:08:05
MRS. RANDALL  I, I stopped by after school just to throw on you some problems that really concerning me. Uhm, I have two daughters, uhm, Laura is ah, 15 and she's the person I wanna talk to you about. Uhm, something's really concerning me, I'd recently learned from the police that she's been involved in some vandalism. 

00:08:25
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
Behavioral definition of the problem from the mother's perspective 

00:08:25
MRS. RANDALL  And, I'm also, I'm really concerned about her grades, 'coz she's a good student and some things are turning that bother me. 

00:08:35
Specific and Concrete 

00:08:35
KIRK ZINCK Oh? Well, what's happened with her grades? 

00:08:40
MRS. RANDALL Well, uhm, just as I said, she's a good student and all of a sudden her grades have just kinda fallen down. 

00:08:45
KIRK ZINCK Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
MRS. RANDALL And uhm, that's a, that's not a pattern. She's had, she's been a good student all through school. 

00:08:50
KIRK ZINCK What's the situation like at home right now? 

00:08:50
MRS. RANDALL  Uhm, we're a real close group. I have ah, one other daughter, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
KIRK ZINCK Hmm. 

00:09:00
MRS. RANDALL - Sarah who's 13, and uhm, my husband left us a number of years ago. And, and we've been a real close, ah, a group. 

00:09:05
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
MRS. RANDALL Uhm, but, all of a sudden, arguments that just weren't there before are emerging. And kinda coincided with the girls' purging adolescence but it, it's really gotten a lot worse in the last ah, short period of time, and then the grades coming down and then finding out that there, that ah, Laura was involved in some vandalism. 

00:09:25
Facilitative condition of empathy 

00:09:25
KIRK ZINCK Oh, that, that was a bit of a shock to you. 

00:09:30
MRS. RANDALL Well, it was. (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
KIRK ZINCK Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
MRS. RANDALL - Uhm, I'd felt like the girls, you know, we talk about things, we're close, and then all of a sudden this behavior that just hadn't been there before. 

00:09:35
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. What would you like to, uhm, see happen in my work with Laura? What would you like me to do with her? 

00:09:45
MRS. RANDALL Well, I think, at, at age 15, continuing to be a good student is, is really important. 

00:09:50
KIRK ZINCK Okay. 

00:09:50
MRS. RANDALL And so I think if, if we could, there could be a way that, that ah, she'd get interested in, in studies again. 'Coz she was interested. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
MRS. RANDALL And she didn't, wasn't just doin' it to do it. She was a good student. She was interested in more than that. It's just not, I don't know. 

00:10:05
KIRK ZINCK But where does she usually study? 

00:10:05
MRS. RANDALL  Uhm, she usually studies- (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
KIRK ZINCK At home or, or she'd do it at school, or does she do homework at home? 

00:10:15
MRS. RANDALL She does homework at home. I can't, I can't tell you about schools. You know that,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. 

00:10:20
MRS. RANDALL - maybe that'll be something she can help you with, but ah, at home, both girls, ah, we would have dinner and ah, they're, they're pretty diligent about their studies but that's not happening now. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
KIRK ZINCK Okay, so that's about their standard routine. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
MRS. RANDALL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
KIRK ZINCK Ahh, Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
MRS. RANDALL Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
KIRK ZINCK What's changed about that situation that if it's been a standard routine and the girls go and do their home work, what's different about that situation at this point? 

00:10:40
MRS. RANDALL Okay. Well, uhm, before they always study, kinda about, in public areas uhm, you know. So, I was just aware that they were studying where it may be, in a kitchen table or one of the family room. Ah, now Laura disappears- (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
MRS. RANDALL Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
MRS. RANDALL - go after dinner, shuts the door, and I'm not sure what's going on. I've noticed, sometimes ah, when she goes to her room, she won't quite get the door shut and then, pretty soon, her sister, Sarah will be down at the hall, and she'd kinda, checks on her. I don't know what's going on there but when Sarah comes running to me, that Laura isn't studying or she's on the phone, or whatever, and then Laura hears it, and then pretty soon, run to just a regular knockdown drag on as far as the studying situation. 

00:11:15
KIRK ZINCK How do you react to hear on that from Sarah? 

00:11:20
MRS. RANDALL Well, uhm, because I'm, I am concerned about Laura's grades, I suppose I sort of focus, just really focus on work- (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. 

00:11:25
MRS. RANDALL - and, and its concern at me, or something. 

00:11:30
KIRK ZINCK Okay, so, how I imagine being a teacher, well, that's a big concern of yours on, ohh. 

00:11:35
MRS. RANDALL Well, it is. It is. And I, and I've heard that, you know, there's some talking in the community now, about Laura as a student, and, and this vandalism sort of thing. And you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
KIRK ZINCK Yeah(ph) (inaudible ). 

00:11:46
MRS. RANDALL - those things get around at school. And, yeah, it does bother me as a teacher. 

00:11:46
KIRK ZINCK Wow, an ordeal. Okay, I'll have Laura in tomorrow as soon as uhm, ah, school gets started and so on, and, ah, you know, talk with her and see what we can do. See if we can begin to work together. 

00:12:00
MRS. RANDALL Okay. Well, thanks a lot, Dr. Zinck. I appreciate that. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
KIRK ZINCK I appreciate that. 

00:12:00
First counseling session with Laura 

00:12:00
KIRK ZINCK  Hi, Laura. Ah, your mom ah, saw me yesterday after school and asked me to get together with you today to talk a little bit. 

00:12:10
Step 1: Defining the problem 

00:12:10
KIRK ZINCK  Uhm, and I'm, I'm wondering if she said anything to you about that last night? 

00:12:20
LAURA Not really. 

00:12:20
KIRK ZINCK She didn't. 

00:12:20
LAURA I don't think she care much about me. 

00:12:25
KIRK ZINCK Oh, well, you know, she, she was in and she was really concerned about a couple of things and, - 

00:12:30
Rapport Building 

00:12:30
KIRK ZINCK - what I'd like to do is share those with you. And then, uhm, I'd like to hear what you see as might, what the problem might be. You know, your view of it. Uhm, your, your mom was real concerned ah, about homework and a drop in grades. She said you ah, dropped pretty ah, dramatically in your grades, you know, and in your school work. And, uhm, she was also concerned about some vandalism that you probably been involved in. 

00:13:00
LAURA I had just some fun, that's all, and. (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
KIRK ZINCK Oh, yeah? Uh-huh. Well, it seemed to have her pretty concerned. What, what do you think is, is happening here? What's, what's your take on things? 

00:13:15
LAURA I don't know. My sister is just like making me mad, and she's always making up stuff that I did. Go tell my mom and act like I'm this big bad person. My mom gets all mad. (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
KIRK ZINCK Alright(ph). 

00:13:30
LAURA She doesn't even know the story. 

00:13:30
KIRK ZINCK What, what's does your sister mostly go to your mom about? Or, what does your mom get mad about mostly? 

00:13:40
LAURA Well, she just comes into my room and she goes, say I'm not doing my homework, I have the radio on while I'm doing my homework. 

00:13:45
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. 

00:13:45
LAURA It's like no big deal. 

00:13:45
Empathy 

00:13:45
KIRK ZINCK Ah, that must be the pay at having to say to come in your room and check up on you. So, as I understand it right now, from what you're telling me, is that you're, ah, in your room doing your homework, is that accurate? 

00:14:05
LAURA Hmm, I am not, really. 

00:14:05
KIRK ZINCK Really? Oh. So, you're in your room when you're supposed to be doing your homework. 

00:14:10
LAURA Well, I don't know. Who says I'm supposed to? 

00:14:15
KIRK ZINCK Oh, yeah, okay. And, when you're in your room, your sister comes and checks up on you. 

00:14:20
Continuing to define the problem behaviorally 

00:14:20
KIRK ZINCK And then ah, goes to your mom and tell hers that you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing. 

00:14:25
LAURA Yeah, my mom was all mad at me. 

00:14:30
KIRK ZINCK Okay, okay. So, when your mom gets, your sister goes tell your mom, your mom gets mad, what happens then? 

00:14:35
LAURA Well, that will start a big fight, and my mom, like, yells at me for, like, doing, like, not doing my homework and stuff, and my sister thinks she's so great 'coz she got me in trouble. 

00:14:50
KIRK ZINCK Okay, so your sister is, kind of, watching the action then that? She, she's started up a little of that. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
LAURA Yeah. 

00:14:55
Normalization of problem 

00:14:55
KIRK ZINCK And ah, you know, sometimes little sisters are like that, I guess, huh. 

00:15:00
Step 2: Exploring Attempted Solutions and Finding Exceptions 

00:15:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Finding exceptions is a solution-focused brief counseling technique developed by Steve De Shazer in Suborg(ph) and their associates in the Milwaukee Brief Therapy Center. In brief counseling, we act on the assumption that clients have exceptions to their problems. Our task is to help clients locate, and to utilize the strengths inherent in their exceptions. In the next part, we see an example of finding exceptions to client's problems. 

00:15:30
KIRK ZINCK Can you think of a time or, or has, excuse me, had there been any times in the last ah, month or two where you've been able to ah, do you homework and be undisturbed and felt good about doing that? 

00:15:45
LAURA  Well, I don't know, she was like, she was gone for, I know some honors(ph) thing, trip somewhere, and I don't know, she wasn't, like, on my back about for not doing my homework, so I don't know, I guess I just did it. 

00:16:00
KIRK ZINCK  So, you did your homework while your sister was gone. Did you, how long was she gone? 

00:16:10
LAURA It'd like a week. 

00:16:10
KIRK ZINCK Really? Oh. And, did you do it everyday of the week, or a couple of days, or- (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
LAURA I think, probably everyday. 

00:16:20
KIRK ZINCK Really? 

00:16:20
LAURA  When I don't get, I mean, she gets the benefit in having my mom yell at me. So, she's not there, so, I just, ah, do it. 

00:16:30
Amplifying the client's exception to the problem. 

00:16:30
KIRK ZINCK So, you're telling me that when your sister's not bugging you, you're doing your homework. 

00:16:35
LAURA Ah, I guess. 

00:16:40
KIRK ZINCK Well. That's really different from what your mom was telling me. You know, what I heard was that you're not doing your homework at all. And here we find that, ah, when your sister is not bugging you, you're able to get your homework done. How did that, how did that feel to be able to do that? 

00:16:55
LAURA  I, I don't know. I mean, I was just glad that she was gone and I get on a break from her bugging me. 

00:17:00
KIRK ZINCK  Okay. 

00:17:05
LAURA I didn't have to get into fights every night. 

00:17:05
KIRK ZINCK You know, I, it, it sounds like that once in a while, while your sister was gone, wouldn't it be great to have her off your back all the time? Wow, that'd be something. 

00:17:15
Detail-oriented about what works 

00:17:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Brief counselors are continually looking for cooperative frameworks, how can they work with the client? One way to do that is through unconditional positive regard. No lecturing, no admonishing. 

00:17:30
Words That Convey Resources *Strengths *Gifts *Attributes *Accomplishments *Assets *Capabilities *Skills *Potential *Abilities *Talents 

00:17:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL A key step in brief counseling is accentuating resources as a way of emphasizing strengths, not deficits. The chart shows many of the words in the English language that can be used to convey resources. 

00:17:45
KIRK ZINCK  How do you feel about school in general? 

00:17:50
LAURA  Well, only, it's not kind of bad. It's, it's like fun, you know and- (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. 

00:17:55
LAURA - the classes aren't that bad and the teachers. 

00:18:00
KIRK ZINCK What's the class that you like best? 

00:18:00
LAURA Well, I really like this one teacher, in Math. 

00:18:05
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. 

00:18:05
LAURA I liked(ph) it. 

00:18:05
KIRK ZINCK Math? Alright, so the teacher's really good? 

00:18:10
LAURA Yeah. 

00:18:10
KIRK ZINCK How are you as a Math student? 

00:18:10
LAURA Not that bad, I guess. 

00:18:10
KIRK ZINCK Oh yeah? All right. What kind of grades do you get there? 

00:18:15
LAURA Well, I was getting, like, some B's, high B's. 

00:18:20
KIRK ZINCK Really? Yeah. You're a better mathematician than I am. 

00:18:25
Continued focus on client's strengths, talents and abilities 

00:18:25
KIRK ZINCK Anything else you like? I mean, other classes, or. 

00:18:25
LAURA Well, I like science too. 

00:18:30
KIRK ZINCK Do you? 

00:18:30
LAURA Yeah, the labs and stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
KIRK ZINCK Oh yeah? 

00:18:30
LAURA (inaudible ) 

00:18:34
KIRK ZINCK  So, there's some aspects at school that you really seem to like and you seem to be kind of into math and science. Are you involved in any activities or anything? 

00:18:40
LAURA  Yeah. Uhm, I like sports a lot. 

00:18:45
KIRK ZINCK What would you like ah, to be able to do as a, as a student, as a,- 

00:18:50
Step 3: Setting a Goal 

00:18:50
KIRK ZINCK - as a young person in the home? What, what would you like to have, have then? 

00:18:55
LAURA Well, I mean, I like to do good in school and I, I like to, you know, get good grades and stuff. 

00:19:05
KIRK ZINCK Really? Wow. 

00:19:05
LAURA Makes you feel good running(ph), to get, that stuff. 

00:19:10
KIRK ZINCK Uh-huh. How, what would you have to do to the, to bring your grades up, and feel good about doing that? 

00:19:15
LAURA Well, I guess, just not worry about my sister, and just get my homework done, and you know, I mean, when I put my mind into it, I can get it done pretty well. 

00:19:30
Rephrasing of the client's goal 

00:19:30
KIRK ZINCK Oh, really. So, if you can, ah, ah, if your sister was, kinda, out of the scene, you won't be worrying about her or uhm, she didn't have any excuse to bug you, you'd probably get your homework done and your grades to be up. 

00:19:40
Step 4: Generating Ways to Reach the Goal 

00:19:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL  To assist students in reaching goals, brainstorming is a valuable tool. We often try to generate at least three ways of reaching a goal. Some of which can be fun, interesting, and exciting. The major idea is that students do something different as a way of moving in the direction of their goal. 

00:20:05
KIRK ZINCK Let's brainstorm. You know, what are some, some ways that ah, you might be able- 

00:20:10
Do something different 

00:20:10
KIRK ZINCK - to kinda kite your sister out so she doesn't have an excuse to check out and tattle on you? 

00:20:15
LAURA Well, if I ain't just do it before, you know, I'm told to do it. 

00:20:20
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
LAURA You know, I can just do it, my sister won't come in and tattle, but if she does, then I, you know, I'll have it ready, I can just show my mom that I, that I got it. Then, my sister will look like a fool. 

00:20:35
KIRK ZINCK Oh, yeah? 

00:20:35
LAURA Yeah. 

00:20:35
KIRK ZINCK That will be interesting. How do you think your sister gonna respond to that? 

00:20:40
LAURA Yeah. I don't think it'll do her some good, actually. 

00:20:45
KIRK ZINCK So that'll be kinda nice, too, to see that action. So, what are some other ways of not having her control you? 

00:20:50
LAURA Well, and also, when she's just like, you know, looks at my, looks in my room and sees what I'm doing, that would just like, bugs me. 

00:20:55
KIRK ZINCK  Yeah? 

00:21:00
LAURA Yeah, 'coz I know she's gonna go get me in trouble. 

00:21:00
KIRK ZINCK Okay, so she comes and checks on you, and that's, that's bothersome. We've, we've covered that. What would happen if you were to imagine her as a some type of a monster or cartoon character, or something like that, or she peeked her head into the room, and you were to imagine that she had something funny look about her. What would happen then? 

00:21:25
LAURA Ah, I mean, I would just laugh and she wouldn't, you know, bother me. 

00:21:30
KIRK ZINCK Oh really, so you'd be laughing at her instead of getting angry at her. Why don't you invite her into your room, and ask her to sit down? 

00:21:40
LAURA Yes. 

00:21:40
KIRK ZINCK Maybe ask her to help you with homework. 

00:21:45
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
KIRK ZINCK Okay, you said it like you had an idea there, too. That was? 

00:21:50
LAURA Well, she doesn't like to, really, come into my room. She just likes to come- (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
LAURA - see what I'm doing. 

00:21:55
KIRK ZINCK During this ah, time, we've talked about a few things. One is, that you do wanna do your homework. And, you'd like to do that in a, kind of, a peaceful way, not being bothered by your sister. 

00:22:05
Do Something Different 

00:22:05
KIRK ZINCK And, some ideas that, that you came up with and, and, between us, we kinda brainstorm, were, one, to uhm, do your homework before you're asked to do it. Ah, and then, when you're, as soon as your sister checks up on you, just produce it for your mom, you know, which would defeat your sister. Uhm, a second is to imagine that she looks ah, like an ogre, a monster, or a cartoon character when she comes into your room and, and to actually end up kinda laughin' at her or smiling at her instead of getting mad. Uhm, and the third one is to invite her into the room and ask her that, to help you with homework. Uhm, and I'm wondering over the next ah, say, several days if you might ah, try out one of those ideas. Maybe, maybe figure out what's your best plan. It's Tuesday, and, uhm, what I would suggest is, maybe we get together out on Friday, say, you know, early afternoon. 

00:23:05
LAURA Okay. 

00:23:05
KIRK ZINCK And, ah, and maybe you can, kind of, tell me ah,- 

00:23:10
Emphasizing to the client to "do something different" 

00:23:10
KIRK ZINCK - what you noticed that was different about these past few days, you know. How's that sound to you? 

00:23:20
LAURA Yeah, sounds good. 

00:23:20
KIRK ZINCK Okay. All right, you think you can ah, develop a plan. 

00:23:25
LAURA Definitely. 

00:23:25
KIRK ZINCK All right. Okay. So, you'll have a little fun with this, huh? 

00:23:25
LAURA  Yeah. 

00:23:30
KIRK ZINCK You look like, you are. All right, good for you. Will see you on Friday then. 

00:23:30
LAURA All right. Thanks a lot. 

00:23:35
Second Counseling Session with Laura 

00:23:35
KIRK ZINCK So, Laura, it's ah, when we last met, we talked about ah, using your best plan to deal with the situation. 

00:23:45
Solution-oriented start 

00:23:45
KIRK ZINCK I'm wondering what worked for you this week. 

00:23:45
LAURA  Well, uhm, usually, I always get my homework done right after school. So, it was all done by dinner time and everything. And so uhm, my sister came in once, you know, and, I kinda just pictured her as, you know, Barney, the dinosaur. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
KIRK ZINCK Okay. 

00:24:00
LAURA  And uhm, I started laughing at her and she just kinda, you know, turned or ran off. It kinda made her a little upset, you know. But, uhm, then, you know, some time, my homework done, when she'd tell my mom in, you know, should, my mom would say, "Oh where is your homework?" and, uhm, so, you know, I'd just show it to her, well, I don't know what she's talking about. And I said, she's got a little problem herself, you know. 

00:24:30
Amplifying client's solution 

00:24:30
KIRK ZINCK So, so, you are able to imagine-- you smiled at your sister, laughed at her,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
LAURA Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
KIRK ZINCK - and she left on her own. 

00:24:35
LAURA  Yeah, she, yeah. She ran off. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
KIRK ZINCK Wow! That's pretty powerful. Uhm, who's in charge now? 

00:24:45
LAURA I'm, I'm in charge of what bothers me. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
KIRK ZINCK Well(ph). 

00:24:50
LAURA - My mom, I think, realizes that Sarah isn't,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
LAURA - uhm, the perfect person that she thought she was. And that, Sarah is kinda provoking a lot of things that bothered me. 

00:25:00
KIRK ZINCK Oh really? 

00:25:00
LAURA Uhm, so and I know now, uhm, I control, you know, what bothers me, what doesn't. And, right now, I guess, I'm okay with my sister. 

00:25:10
KIRK ZINCK You are. So, you, it, this is a, a solution that hasn't put you two in a more of a fight, or anything? It just kinda moved you into a position of a being in charge of your own ah, room and. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
LAURA Right, yeah. I'm more so confident now. I don't have to, you know uhm, my little sister, you know, bug me, and everything. So. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
KIRK ZINCK Wow! That's quite a deal, especially for just- (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
LAURA Yeah, a couple of days. 

00:25:35
KIRK ZINCK - just a few days. Yeah. Just that one little shove(ph), and then your mom comes in and checks with you, and you showed the homework. 

00:25:45
LAURA Yeah, and then, she's happy coz I got my homework done. 

00:25:45
KIRK ZINCK  Well, that's really neat. 

00:25:50
Follow-up Session with Laura's Mother 

00:25:50
MRS. RANDALL  I just wanna stop by and say thanks for being with Laura. 

00:25:55
KIRK ZINCK Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
MRS. RANDALL Uhm, thought you might like to know a little bit about some of the things I've observe, I've observed at home. Uhm, Laura's, and her sister Sarah seemed to be, sort of, back to their uhm, getting on with each other fine. Uhm, and, uhm, I just sort of observed in Laura, she's interested in her school work again, ah, being around some of her friends that ah, also like to study and, and a good students, and uhm, just a whole tenor of our household has shifted. And, and so I, I wanna thank you for, ah, for spending time with Laura. 

00:26:30
Solution-oriented summarization 

00:26:30
KIRK ZINCK Sure, I enjoyed it. It, it sounds like the tension has come down. 

00:26:35
MRS. RANDALL Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
KIRK ZINCK And that Laura has, has kinda gone back to what's kinda typical behavior for her. 

00:26:40
MRS. RANDALL Certainly, what I had observed before this and, uhm, as far as I know, I'm not aware of any vandalism kinds of things. Uhm. 

00:26:45
KIRK ZINCK So that, maybe, taken cared of itself up. 

00:26:45
MRS. RANDALL May, maybe. 

00:26:45
KIRK ZINCK  Sometimes, it happens. A, a, a youngster will get involved back, reinvolved- (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
MRS. RANDALL Uh-huh. 

00:26:55
KIRK ZINCK in school, and the other things around just kinda level out. So- (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
MRS. RANDALL Uh-huh, yeah,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
KIRK ZINCK Well. 

00:26:55
MRS. RANDALL - so ah, just thought you'd like to know things are, from our viewpoint, uhm, back to what we were, sort of, having before. 

00:27:05
KIRK ZINCK Super. Thanks for letting me know. I appreciate it. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
MRS. RANDALL Uh hmm, you're welcome. 

00:27:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL In our second case, second case entitled, A Tug of War in my Head. I worked with John, a fifth grader, who has a tendency to get very upset in his classroom. We see two brief counseling sessions in their entirety. 

00:27:20
A Tug of War In My Head 

00:27:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  As we begin the session, I emphasize that I want to hear very much John's point of view of what's happening. 

00:27:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hi, John. Uhm, your teacher, Mr. Iving(ph), wanted me to talk with you. He said, this is his version, he said he had been seeing, sort of, out you out on the playground,- 

00:27:40
Step 1: Defining the problem 

00:27:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and seemed like, case when your losing your temper out there, and sometimes also in the classroom. So, Mr. Iving said that, that's what's happening outside, that's how he sees it. But I'm wondering, how do you see this? 

00:27:55
JOHN I think I see it the same but, ah, it's just uncontrollable. All of a sudden, I was in burst in a temper. I don't really even know where it's from. 

00:28:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, this came almost surprising yourself? 

00:28:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:28:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Oh. And that happens on the playground, ah, said, sometimes, occasionally happens maybe in the classroom also. 

00:28:15
JOHN Yeah, I can. No one, well, stomp my feet or something like that. Sort of like a math problems are hard enough. I go, it gets me up and going. 

00:28:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
JOHN And I just really can't control myself. 

00:28:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm, all of a sudden, you find it, your feet start stomping. It's kinda like, you're looking down and, that's me. 

00:28:30
JOHN Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Any other places, other areas of your life? 

00:28:35
JOHN Well, sometimes in happens at home, too. You know, just all of a sudden again. Like, like my sister she's bugging me all this time, I just really get over carried about it, just burst out. 

00:28:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Next I asked John to show me what his behavior looks like. This serves two purposes. First, it provides a context for what and where the behavior occurs. Second, it provides a behavioral demonstration, whether they're just a verbal description. 

00:29:05
Concrete detail of problem behavior 

00:29:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Can you give me just a sample. I know this may be a little bit embarrassing but can you show me what you do when this sort of happens to you? (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
JOHN When I'm mad, I'm gonna hard pound and just stomp my feet. Like, you know, I get really up and tight. I get a mean fist or something, the look on my face, you know. Usually, the teacher catches(ph) me, and I think that's really a lot. He's noticing it. 

00:29:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Kinda like, you, you'd scare people around you. By. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
JOHN Yeah, that's sort of embarrassing for me, too. 'Coz, you know, he's, he's started saying out in front of the class, you know, "Oh, John, please stop that," sort of embarrassing for me. I really don't wanna do it but all of a sudden just get all mad and stomp. 

00:29:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:29:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL After talking about the problem, we begin to explore attempted solutions and also exceptions to the problem. In the segment to follow, we go back and forth between exploring exceptions and finding out what have been John's attempted solutions. 

00:30:00
Step 2: Finding Attempted Solutions And Exploring Exceptions 

00:30:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL I'm curious John, are there ever any times, when you-- like on the playground or maybe in class, or even at your sister, that you would maybe start to do that and then all of a sudden, hit yourself with something? 

00:30:15
JOHN I've done that a couple of times but I think its mainly I just can't catch myself. Once or two, twice I tried to catch myself about to stop, you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
JOHN - you try to gain control from them so, why don't you do this? I'll just gain control, when you should have and be done with it. 

00:30:30
Focus on exceptions to the problem 

00:30:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm, so, how do you do that? How do you catch yourself? What happens when this? 

00:30:30
JOHN  I can sort of-- I could just lose control, like I'm, and uhm, then finally I can say, "Oh, I don't wanna do this, right before I want to stop, or I don't need to do this, I can't, just gonna find with a rea-, reasonable answer,- 

00:30:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
JOHN and I don't need a, it all get carried away over, so that's how I catch myself, that's how I stop myself from doing that stuff. 

00:30:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL So on occasion, you kinda catch yourself- (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
JOHN Yes. 

00:30:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and it stops? 

00:30:55
JOHN Yeah, but mostly I'm not being able to catch it. It's mainly the only reason I'm being able to catch myself is because I'm sort of like, all of a sudden, I don't need to do this, but sometimes you, know you, they get-- I wanna do this so bad, but you know. 

00:31:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL  When you say I don't need to do this, whose voice is it? 

00:31:15
JOHN I think that's really my conscience you know ah, it's so ah, like, it's a, it's a tug of war, going on in my head, once I've said, It's alright to loose your temper, go ahead, blow up. The other side is saying, no. Well, come on, there's a reasonable expla-, explanation for all this. 

00:31:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Okay, so. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
JOHN Usually, I think the ah, say-, the one's that saying go ahead and open fire and blow up. 

00:31:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL So over here it's, go ahead, and over here,- (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
JOHN Yeah. Usually, there's one- (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - hold back. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
JOHN that says blow up, and one that. 

00:31:45
Step 3: Setting A Goal 

00:31:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL As a way of helping John set a goal in the third step, I asked him the miracle question. 

00:31:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Well, I'm wondering, you know, if a miracle were to happen, out there on the playground,- 

00:32:00
Miracle Question 

00:32:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - tomorrow in the classroom, with your sister, if a miracle were to happen when you wake up, and things would be how you like it, or this over here this voice? Would it be reasonable? 

00:32:10
JOHN  Yeah. 

00:32:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL What would that be like? What would be, what would be the first thing you'd notice that would say, "0h, I guess some miracle has happened." 

00:32:20
JOHN That there's no side, that there's, there's no side that's tugging it, so everytime I build a, I look at myself and I bet that that's what's happening, you know, I wouldn't even start doing that by something that's really just, one side out and starts to blow up, then you know the other side, finally catches it, but what if there's no other side, that's easy I could go scratch myself, I don't even need to blow up. 

00:32:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm, So- (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
JOHN That's(ph). 

00:32:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - it somehow, it turned that part off? 

00:32:45
JOHN Yeah, I think I'll be. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL To diminish that, would be much better. 

00:32:50
JOHN Yes, it would. I think so. 

00:32:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay, so, what would be the first indication to you that this is no longer as powerful? 

00:33:00
JOHN I wouldn't be, even be, even catching myself starting to do that, I wouldn't even have to worry about being able to, you know, lose my temper, you know, over my problems, I just go through it, it might be tough, I might get mad, and you know I wouldn't show it, I'll just keep it to my head. It's like, it's, it's a the same if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all,-(crosstalk) 

00:33:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
JOHN - sort of that thing. 

00:33:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL  So what's the first indication that this is starting to go on? 

00:33:30
JOHN  Oh, I would to start getting a mad face, you know, I tried to, and I really would wanna stomp, you know. 

00:33:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL So you can get a mad face? 

00:33:40
JOHN Yeah, yeah, sort of, and I start stomping, you know, but, usually, luckily, I could catch myself before I even stomp. 

00:33:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. What happens even before the mad face? 

00:33:50
JOHN  Well, number one, it's really, it's something that's irritating, like my old sister, she get, she gets so irritating. You know, if that happens the first time, I can, like the second time. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL There are certain irritating things in life- (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:34:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - I mean, sisters happen to be in that category- (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:34:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - sometimes. 

00:34:10
JOHN By the third time, you know, there's like in the math but my try once, let's try it second it's okay, but when finally the third time, when I try it you know, I just really have to, well, it's like the third time is a charm. I really- (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL So in other words, you're successful both with at a one time, two times, it's when it reached, sort of, gets to three,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
JOHN  Uh hmm, I,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL -the, that- (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JOHN I just blow up. 

00:34:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL - the voice starts. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JOHN Like there's three steps in the vol-- a couple of steps and the volcano exploding. 

00:34:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:34:35
JOHN Ah, all, it's all of a sudden, the volcano doesn't explode,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
JOHN - where it's something has to be started first of all, then I saw the side effect in which you-- I started yell, yell at pretty mad but nothing that would blow up, but then all of a sudden, boom and boom. 

00:34:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  So if you were ah, begin looking at those situations where you get annoyed, you're hit it(ph). 

00:35:00
JOHN Yes. 

00:35:00
Detail-oriented about his goal 

00:35:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - how many would have be couple(ph) it have before you started to blow up? The three is in two meaning. 

00:35:10
JOHN Yeah. 

00:35:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL It's like one, two, three are already there. 

00:35:10
JOHN Yeah, I'd like to have what, it's really hard to say I'd love to have you know, not even having even both of those steps,- (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
JOHN - not even ah, having to do it but, it's sort I just, I think it sort of natural. I'd love to have five steps, if I could do a five, I could start catching myself and see, around three. I think it John three to four; four, that, you know, I start- (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm(ph). 

00:35:35
JOHN to catch myself, and it's too late. 

00:35:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Right now, you get up to three, possibly four. That's when you blow. 

00:35:40
JOHN That's blow, well, now five, that's when I start catching myself. If, if I'm walking, you know, I might start stomping. You get one, this would be great to catch myself. 

00:35:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, if we could put off delay, the number of steps, sounds like that would be really diminish that moves(ph)? 

00:36:00
JOHN Yes, it would. 

00:36:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, what's the most you've ever been annoyed number of times and you're still not blowing up? 

00:36:05
JOHN I think that's, that's the time when I catch myself right in front and you do it and I'm like, I'll gonna blow up, you know, then I catch myself, then I could cool down and I can overcome it. Once I know I don't wanna do this, I can overcome it. It's quite easy to overcome. 

00:36:20
Step 4: Generating Ways to Reach the Goal 

00:36:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Compliments are a powerful way of supporting client's strengths. I compliment John on his knowledge about the situation, then I move to a do-something-different type of task, to help him reach his goal of controlling his temper. I emphasize tasks that can be fun, interesting and exciting. 

00:36:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL You know John, as we're talking I guess I'm really impressed with how much you know about the situation. It sounds like you've almost studied it. Like you're a good student that knowing, you know, what it takes, when, when it happens, when it doesn't happen, and I would wonder if we might have a task here for you to do. 

00:37:10
Task: Do something different 

00:37:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL And the task would be, to begin to do something different when it gets to three and four, so that there has a chance that you gonna get five, six, seven, eight. And I'm wondering, what, what sort of things that you might do differently, at five or at four or at three, that would sort of delay that and I keep that voice over here, just out of sight. How does that, how does sound? Is it possible? 

00:37:45
JOHN I'm not sure in number one would be one (inaudible ) of these have to happen but of course it's pretty much impossible I can score(ph) you have to do- (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:37:50
JOHN - hard enough about Mr. Irving(ph) the thing. My sister, Ishena(ph)- (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Ishena(ph), hmm. 

00:37:55
JOHN - does it all the time, can't stop her or anything like that. 

00:38:00
Emphaty 

00:38:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Your sister's not gonna go away. 

00:38:00
JOHN Yeah. 

00:38:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL I mean, hard math problems are not gonna go away- (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:38:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and so? 

00:38:05
JOHN  Ah, one thing I. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL What, in fact, what I would suggest you do is some real fun and interesting and exciting sort of things that you can do differently, when you get up to that two, that three, that four. 

00:38:20
JOHN  I think I could possibly overpower it. But the thing is, the first thing that happens is he starts to tugging which get it to the head start like in the race, if someone counts to five,- (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
JOHN -but they went off at three, they're gonna get the head start, but if I think I could possibly know that this voice, keeps on saying, okay you're gonna do this, I have to stop you here before you get, you can get started. 

00:38:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL So it's that, almost like, like in a race, that first that this over here, not on the starting block- (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
JOHN Yes. 

00:38:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL That even goes of. 

00:38:50
JOHN If I think, I think if they, if uhm, I could possibly just catch myself before I'm even beginning, even on the first step and it's totally mad like that. 

00:39:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:39:00
JOHN If I could catch myself, I'd be great, you know. The thing is when I catch myself you know, it's over, it doesn't happen again. 

00:39:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. So if this voice over here, this part of you said "ah, you started before the gun went off, go back." 

00:39:20
JOHN Something like that, or even if he started- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Even if- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JOHN - before the gun went off,- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Oh. 

00:39:20
JOHN - so he starts cheating, you know? And catches,- (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:39:25
JOHN - something like that. 

00:39:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. So this part could get to, the jump on this part? 

00:39:30
JOHN  Yes. 

00:39:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Even the tug of war between the voices in Johns head. I move to a way of having John be more in control of them. I use cassettes, and sports metaphors to talk a language that will make sense to him. I also help him to generate several different ways to reach his goal. 

00:39:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Now you talked about a voice over here, let me just suggest another possibility is, you have something that you play your CDs on? 

00:40:00
JOHN Yes, I usually use my dad's sorts of record play. 

00:40:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL You ever crank it up a little bit higher- (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
JOHN Yes, I do. 

00:40:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - than parents like? 

00:40:10
JOHN Uh-huh. 

00:40:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh, taking this voice over here from you, can you hear that voice that's over here for you? 

00:40:15
JOHN Yes. 

00:40:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. As you listen to that, pretend like you're cranking it just a little bit higher, what happens? 

00:40:25
JOHN (inaudible ) 

00:40:27
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay, now move down to just a little sound. 

00:40:30
JOHN Yeah, yeah, I won't (inaudible ) 

00:40:33
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay, and I'll just turn it off. 

00:40:35
JOHN Okay, maybe I will. 

00:40:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Now, practice that one for just a minute. 

00:40:40
JOHN  I hate to say this, it's sort of hard to, it's sort of new, something that blows me up, something like that. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. Something you would imagine your sister irritating you four times. 

00:40:55
JOHN Yeah. 

00:40:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL That would get it? 

00:40:55
JOHN Yeah, think so. 

00:40:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Okay. 

00:41:00
JOHN I think I can't get it right. 

00:41:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Now, on that, like a CD or cassette tape, you can erase tapes and you can put some different messages there. 

00:41:10
JOHN Yes, you can. 

00:41:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL What would you put on a tape, that would be a much more pleasant, useful sound to this side. 

00:41:20
Client-generated solution 

00:41:20
JOHN Oh, I think it's really just plain rock and roll in my head when I get to start schooling. If I sort of had a peaceful music. 

00:41:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
JOHN Something that might a, Mr., our teacher, plays in the morning he was like, has a tendency to play a better peaceful music in the morning. 

00:41:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL I'll, I'll put you in that part for a minute. What does that sound like? 

00:41:40
JOHN Ah, it's hard to tell was that. You know, it's sort of just ah, not a giant chord. Not gia-, not a giant, not sound like a giant band. But you notice a soft, kind a little sound. 

00:41:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
JOHN Humming. 

00:41:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Try that over here, that sound, let's sort of just replace what was there, and pitch that one and put that other one there. What's that like? 

00:42:00
JOHN I think it would help much more 'coz you know, it can have a tug-of-war game it's like one (inaudible ) on the same team saying, what are with you- (crosstalk) 

00:42:08
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:08
JOHN - but I show you to one, showing you, there'll be no point. 

00:42:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL  So you got now both on the same team? 

00:42:15
Sports Metaphor 

00:42:15
JOHN Yes, since I'd be in baseball(ph). 

00:42:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Congratulations, yeah, it's sounds like some teamwork going there. What's the third thing that you'll possibly do? 

00:42:25
JOHN The third thing, that's hard to say. 

00:42:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Think of one, I'll guess who. 

00:42:30
JOHN  A very wild guess, I mean that miracle would happen,- (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:42:35
JOHN - but of course it something that's new. 

00:42:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay, the miracles gonna happen, that somehow,- (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
JOHN Yes. 

00:42:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - something has to be different about it, so what would be your goal for this next couple of days here? 

00:42:50
JOHN To replace the ah, the bad voice with the quiet voice. 

00:42:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
JOHN To get it in, just isn't be out of control. 

00:42:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. So the softer music, like in class, would be the one possibility? 

00:43:00
JOHN Yeah. 

00:43:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Have you practiced next couple of days here, putting that new tape in? I think, I think it'll take a little bit of practice on that, 'coz it won't come automatically. Ah, I think that side is not gonna give up for playing that sort of ah, go for it, lose your temper but that's not an easy thing necessarily. But, uhm, are there times, like in sports or other things when you really have a real determination to stay out of something. 

00:43:35
JOHN I think that sports is much easier because in sports, you always have a chance to get ahead, jump ahead without, I mean. But school, I think it's the same way but I just haven't got the hang of that. I think in sports I've got ahead just like said, "If they're gonna do ahead it make my goal(ph) up ah, get ahead of them. 

00:43:50
Using a sports metaphor to facilitate client change 

00:43:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  So you could treat this like a sports event? 

00:43:55
JOHN That would be a good idea. 

00:43:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:43:55
JOHN  A good great idea, actually. 

00:44:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL And it gets to be played out on your head, and I'm curious as to when's the next time that you think it'll gonna be tested? 

00:44:10
JOHN I'm not sure, probably in school, I'd say besides I've school tomorrow. 

00:44:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:44:15
JOHN I think that's ah, oh, you know, oh, possibly- (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:44:20
JOHN - about losing my temper. 

00:44:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Unless you knew there's some new options here. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
JOHN Yes, yes. 

00:44:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Why don't you drop in tomorrow afternoon, after classes, and give me a report about how this new sport is coming along. 

00:44:35
JOHN All right. 

00:44:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL  And we'll talk at that point. (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
JOHN Okay. Thank you very much. 

00:44:40
Second Counseling Session with John 

00:44:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Hi John, welcome back. 

00:44:45
JOHN Thank you. 

00:44:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL  How thing's goin? You've started off on a goal of overcoming that temper? (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
JOHN Well, thing's have been so much better for me, I mean, I haven't been blowing up or anything like that. It's just real amazing. 

00:45:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL No blow ups? 

00:45:00
JOHN No, I've just been able to overcome that bad voice, it's just amazing how amount well it is working for me. 

00:45:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  So how did you do it? 

00:45:10
JOHN Ah, well, I think I just took your advice and I turn that, just you know and so I crank it up, I crank it down. It didn't flare up or anything like that. 

00:45:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL  You mean just cranking that down, made the difference for you? 

00:45:20
JOHN Uh-huh. 

00:45:20
Cheerleading 

00:45:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Wow, congratulations! 

00:45:25
JOHN Thank you. 

00:45:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL That's a neat job. 

00:45:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL I often cheerlead students accomplishments by shaking their hand. I find that a handshake is a socially acceptable way of acknowledging their accomplishments, and in this case, you're showing respect from an adult to a young person. 

00:45:40
Focus On Continuation Of Change 

00:45:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL  I've been very impressed with you here in one day, how you've been able to crank things down and start making a difference for yourself. 

00:45:50
JOHN Yeah. 

00:45:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Would you keep me posted? 

00:45:50
More Cheerleading 

00:45:50
JOHN  I will. 

00:45:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay, thanks a lot, congratulations. 

00:45:55
JOHN Thank you. 

00:45:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL  As it, this videotape to a close. A brief summary is important. Brief counseling is a new way of thinking about problems but more importantly, it is a new way of thinking about solutions. This video has been about increasing student's choices, helping them make changes as quickly as possible, and cheering them on with an unshakeable belief in their capacity to reach their goals and to reach them rapidly. As you have studied this video tape, we hoped that we have whetted your appetite to learn more about brief counseling. My book, Brief Counseling in Action, and it's two accompanying videotapes would be one place to start. Other excellent sources of information are listed in the written materials accompanying this video. In conclusion, we wish you the best as you practice brief counseling with your students.
