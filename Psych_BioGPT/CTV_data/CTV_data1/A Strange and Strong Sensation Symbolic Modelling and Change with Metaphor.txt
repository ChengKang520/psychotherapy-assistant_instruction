with Penny Tompkins and James Lawley 

00:00:40
PENNY TOMPKINS You are about to watch an example of an extraordinary process called symbolic modeling. We use symbolic modeling in a therapeutic context for working with the clients' metaphors and symbols. Symbolic modeling is derived from the work of David Grove. David is a psychotherapist who spent 15 years developing a language model called clean language, specifically designed to work with clients' metaphors and symbols. 

00:01:15
Stage of Process names of symbols, their attributes and relationships 

00:01:15
JAMES LAWLEY Because navigating through a client's metaphor landscape may be unfamiliar to you, we provide a number of signposts for you to follow the client's journey, and they will show the key metaphors and how they change throughout the session. 

00:01:30
PENNY TOMPKINS And what would you like to have happen? 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN I would like clarity on why I'm always late for things. 

00:01:45
PENNY TOMPKINS And you would like to have clarity on why you're always late for things? And when you would like to have clarity, is there anything else when you would like to have clarity on why you're always late for things? 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Um, well, I'd like to know why I put myself through that anxiety, cuz I'm sure it's not necessary. 

00:02:15
PENNY TOMPKINS And when you have clarity and you'd like to know why you put yourself through that anxiety, what kind of clarity is that clarity that you would like? 

00:02:30
Metaphor 1 shape 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Um, heck, I can see (ph)him as a shape, actually. It's something that's right here, and I don't know what it is. 

00:02:50
PENNY TOMPKINS And it's a shape and it's something right here, and is there anything else about that shape? 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN It's a bit icy. 

00:02:55
Metaphor 1 icy shape 

00:03:00
PENNY TOMPKINS And it's a bit icy, and it's a shape, and it's a bit icy and it's here. And is there anything else about that icy or that shape? 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN I want to touch it, but I'm worried that it's uh, cold, literally like ice. 

00:03:20
PENNY TOMPKINS And you want to touch it and you're worried that it's cold like ice, and that's the clarity that you would like on why you're always late for things? 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:40
PENNY TOMPKINS And when a shape and icy and you would like to touch it, how far away is that shape? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN It's here. 

00:03:55
PENNY TOMPKINS And it's here? And is there anything else when it's here? 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Um, I think it's always there. I can't make it closer. Don't think I'd want to make it further away, but I can't make it closer. 

00:04:15
PENNY TOMPKINS And you can't make it closer and you wouldn't want to make it further away and it's icy and shape, and when icy and shape, then what happens? 

00:04:25
Metaphor 1 icy bar in here 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN So then I want to move it; it's like a bar. I want to, to shake it and make it move, but I'm uh, I can feel it, then, in here, something it does to me in here must be connected. 

00:04:45
Metaphor 1 icy bar connected in here 

00:04:45
PENNY TOMPKINS And it must be connected when you want to shake it and make it move and you can feel it in here, and when you can feel it in here, whereabouts in here can you feel it? 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN It's right here, on my stomach. 

00:05:00
PENNY TOMPKINS And on your stomach? And when it's on your stomach, is it on the inside or the outside? 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Uh, it's like the front half of my body. 

00:05:15
PENNY TOMPKINS And like the front half of your body, and when the front half of your body, does that have a size or a shape? 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Uh, yes, well, it's a kind of scooped out shape, a bit like a bowl on its side. 

00:05:35
Metaphor 1 icy bar connected scooped-out shape 

00:05:40
PENNY TOMPKINS And a scooped out shape a bit like a bowl on its side, and when a bowl on its side and connected must be connected, is there anything else about that must be connected when you can feel it? 

00:06:00
Metaphor 1 icy bar connected scooped-out shape 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's like, if I could move the bar it would probably pull out the scooped shape, as if it's linked to it, so I want to move it and make this thing shift a bit. 

00:06:20
PENNY TOMPKINS And you want to move it and make this thing shift a bit, and you, if you could move the bar, it would pull it, and when it would pull it and it's connected, is there anything else about that connected? 

00:06:35
Metaphor 1 icy bar connected strands scooped-out shape 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Um, I don't like it, I don't like it. There are stands of whatever it is that's connecting it, and it's aggravating. Now I know it's there. It's irritating. 

00:06:55
PENNY TOMPKINS It's irritating and it's aggravating, and when it's irritating and it's aggravating, now that you know it's there, what would strands like to have happen? 

00:07:15
[sil.] 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN They just want a break, as in, have a rest. I think they'd like to go to bed. Uh, I don't think they like being there either. 

00:07:30
PENNY TOMPKINS And they just want a break? 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:35
PENNY TOMPKINS As in a rest, to go to bed? 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:35
PENNY TOMPKINS And it's aggravating now that you know that they're there, and they just want a break and it's aggravating. Then what happens? 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN Well, then I wonder why it's all there in the first place? So now I can see it. I question it, but it feels a bit uh, brutal to just try and force it and yank it out. It feels like it needs a bit of coaxing or a bit of understanding. 

00:08:15
PENNY TOMPKINS And it feels like it needs a bit of coaxing or understanding, and it would be brutal just to pull it out? And what kind of coaxing is that coaxing and understanding? 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Um . . . 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN . . . I suppose this (ph)scoopy shape . . . It's attached on the inside, so if I pull it, it would just rip, uh, so it needs easing. I suppose I need to know that I don't need that thing there, something like that, so that it can be eased out, but maybe it needs somewhere to go, this whole thing. 

00:09:10
PENNY TOMPKINS It needs coaxing and understanding and maybe it needs somewhere to go and easing, and when it needs easing, coaxing, then what happens? 

00:09:30
[sil.] 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN I'm not sure I need someone to, to help me with it. I feel like it's only me here with this thing. Uh, I'd like to know I could hand it to someone who could do something with it, not a real person but something symbolic for me that felt safe. 

00:10:00
PENNY TOMPKINS And something symbolic for you that felt safe that you could hand it to. 

00:10:05
JAMES LAWLEY And when there's that icy and they're connected and the scoopy thing and you'd like someone to - symbolic - to hand it to, what's the relationship between all of that and always late? 

00:10:25
Metaphor 2 ordered space 

00:10:25
Metaphor 2 ordered peaceful space 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN It's as if it uh, gets in the way of me just being in an ordered space, so that if I want to do something I can just do it. It's like I always have to deal with this thing, and uh, it's a hindrance, so I'm thinking of that in terms of if I was getting ready to go somewhere, it doesn't quite allow me to be in just a peaceful space and get on with what I'm doing. This thing is there, which I didn't know about until now. 

00:11:10
JAMES LAWLEY So it didn't, doesn't allow you to be in a peaceful space when you're getting ready? So what kind of peaceful space is that peaceful space? 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:20
Metaphor 2 ordered peaceful calm space 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN It's uh, it's a place without clutter and distraction. It's just a calm space where I want to do one thing and I can just do it without getting distracted by something else, uh, bothered about things, thinking about other things. It's a space where I can just do one thing at a time. 

00:11:50
JAMES LAWLEY A space where you can do one thing at a time and not being distracted, and it, and what you want is to have that space and not be, and not have this hindrance that gets in the way? And so, when you're getting ready to go somewhere, what happens just before there's this hindrance? 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Just before . . . 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:25
Metaphor 3 dreamy world fuzziness muddled thinking 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Uh, I think I'm in a bit of a, bit of a dreamy world, not really uh, connected to where I'm needing to go. I think so. 

00:12:50
JAMES LAWLEY A dreamy world that's not connected to where you need to go, yeah. Anything else about this dreamy world that you're in that's not connected? 

00:13:00
Metaphor 3 dreamy world fuzziness mother muddled thinking 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN It's probably connected to all sorts of places except right now, you know, except the present moment. Uh, it's probably connected to my childhood a lot, um, and there's just, there's a lot of fuzziness, a lot of muddled thinking that makes me think of my mother, for some reason. 

00:13:30
JAMES LAWLEY The fuzziness and muddled thinking . . . And when you think of your mother and fuzziness and muddled thinking, where is the fuzziness and the muddled thinking? 

00:13:45
Metaphor 3 dreamy world fuzziness /stuff mother muddled thinking 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN The fuzziness is sort of wrapped around me, a bit like, um, that stuff they insulate lofts with, um, so a bit of candy floss, cotton wool, uh, and the muddled thinking is trying to operate through that. 

00:14:10
JAMES LAWLEY Ah, through the candy floss loft . . . 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:10
JAMES LAWLEY . . . insulation. 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN As if I'm trying to deal with being me in a space where I'm surrounded by the static of my mother's muddled thinking, something like that, so I'm thinking, "Leave me out of all that," but then I can't work out what I need to do. 

00:14:35
JAMES LAWLEY You're thinking, "Leave me out of all that," the static of a mother's thinking, but then you can't think of what to do to get ready and be in that space. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:50
PENNY TOMPKINS And then you're not connected to where you need to go, and that's a dreamy world. Just before, you're in an ordered and peaceful space. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Um, just before, yes, if I could get into the ordered and peaceful space. 

00:15:05
JAMES LAWLEY But just before the hindrance . . . 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, it comes in, because that comes in, then I suspect when I do need to connect with what I'm doing next, but then I haven't got the, the tools or something to access that space of then getting ready to go and do something. 

00:15:30
[sil.] 

00:15:35
JAMES LAWLEY Is there anything else about that hindrance and the static of the dreamy world (ph)or (ph)the . . . 

00:15:45
Metaphor 3 dreamy world fluffy stuff protect mother muddled thinking 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Uh, (crosstalk)it's very annoying, actually. Now I'm aware of it; it's very annoying, um, particularly this uh, stuff. I want to uh, move it away, particularly this. I feel this thing is more my own creation. It may be annoying but it's uh, but this stuff, just, I had to put there to protect me from the uh, static of the muddled thinking. 

00:16:15
JAMES LAWLEY (crosstalk) . . . peaceful place? 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
JAMES LAWLEY And so you li- . . . So this is more yours . . . 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, not that (crosstalk)I wanna keep it, but I have (crosstalk)to kind of own that I put that there for whatever reason. 

00:16:30
JAMES LAWLEY (crosstalk)But your creation. (crosstalk)No. Okay. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Um, but that fluffy stuff . . . I'd really like that to go. 

00:16:40
PENNY TOMPKINS And you put it there to protect you? 

00:16:40
Metaphor 3 dreamy world fluffy stuff protect swift manoeuvre little girl mother muddled thinking mum driving crazy 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. It must've been a swift maneuver when I was a little girl, is my guess. 

00:16:50
JAMES LAWLEY And so when it was a swift maneuver when you were a little girl, what happened just before that swift maneuver that put that fluffy thing there? 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Um, my mum was driving me crazy and, and then I could see immediately that when I did that swift maneuver I just went off into a dreamy, little girl playing mode to kind of distract myself from the fact that I felt guilty for: A, acknowledging that my mum was driving me crazy; and B, putting up a thing to protect me from that muddled thing. 

00:17:30
JAMES LAWLEY And so when a mum is driving you crazy, whereabouts is Mum? 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Uh, over there somewhere. 

00:17:40
JAMES LAWLEY So she's over there somewhere. In a swift maneuver you put up a fluffy thing and then uh, uh, go and play . . . 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:50
JAMES LAWLEY . . . and then will feel guilty that you've done that, that you've acknowledged the mother's driving you crazy and that you've gone off and played . . . 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN And that I've put up the fluffy (crosstalk)thing. 

00:18:00
JAMES LAWLEY (crosstalk) . . . and then put up the fluffy thing. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:18:05
JAMES LAWLEY What kind of little girl is a little girl that puts up a fluffy thing? 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Uh, a desperate one . . . 

00:18:15
JAMES LAWLEY Desperate? 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN . . . I think. 

00:18:20
JAMES LAWLEY And so what would that little girl like to have happen when her mother is driving her crazy? 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN I would've liked, uh, I would have liked her to have said, "Oh, I'm sorry. That's mine, all that stuff I'm throwing around you" and take it back and still be my mum, so that I could be with her without having to reject part of how she was behaving. 

00:18:50
JAMES LAWLEY So you'd like her to, to have take, to take all of her, that stuff back? 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'd like her to have owned it and said, "Don't imagine this is yours," you know, "I'm sorry. You're my little girl. This is my stuff that comes from wherever." 

00:19:05
PENNY TOMPKINS And is that what you would like to have happen or what little girl would like to have happen? 

00:19:10
Metaphor 4 way station safe place go different places brake 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN That's what the little girl would like to have happened, and um, I would like the same thing, I suppose. I would like it to . . . I don't know. The fluffy thing is what I put up to protect against the muddled thinking, so it's a bit different now. Um, I wouldn't want to throw anything back at her, but I would like to ease it away and maybe put it in a bit of a way station so that I didn't have to deal with it and, if she wanted to look at it at any time, she could, um, but I don't want to angrily return it to her, um, but I don't want it. 

00:20:00
JAMES LAWLEY And you would put it, do wanna put it an a way station where she could look at it if she wanted to. So what kind of way station is that way station that you could put it in? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Uh, it's just a safe place. It's a little, kind of round platform over there. 

00:20:15
PENNY TOMPKINS Whereabouts over there is the little round platform way station? 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN It's there on the floor down there, and it's like one of those things where lorries or trains are so long that can't turn and they go into a circular thing and it turns and they change tracks, so it can go back there. So it's kind of got the option to go in different places but not back to me, cuz I can put a little brake on the edge and a little 'No Entry' sign, so uh, it's quite efficient. 

00:20:50
JAMES LAWLEY And so when a fluffy goes to a way station you can put a brake on it? Then what happens? 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Well, I haven't done it yet, uh, so perhaps I should try it, and then I'll know, because otherwise I don't know. 

00:21:15
JAMES LAWLEY Okay. And is there anything else that needs to happen before you try it? 

00:21:25
Conditions for Change 1 mother encouraging sister & father blessing future me 'be aware' everybody 'go ahead' ground solid clean clear on high 'do it' 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Uh, I don't thi- . . . I think my mother's encouraging me, actually, to do it. I don't think she wants me to have this thing. Perhaps she realizes . . . Uh . . . And uh, and I also get blessing to do it from my sister and my father, who are over there, so maybe I just needed the agreement of my family, my immediately family unit. 

00:22:05
JAMES LAWLEY So her mother's encouraging, and her sister and her father are, are blessing, yes? And is there anything else that needs to happen before you're ready to put that over there? 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN Uh, then I see a future me saying, "Just . . . It's fine to do it, but be aware that you will then be in a different place," you know, "You'll feel different; different things can happen." Uh, so it's like as if I have to just uh, be aware of that, take that onboard. 

00:22:40
JAMES LAWLEY And that's the future me? Whereabouts is that future me? 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN You mean located around (crosstalk)here? Oh, sort of up and over the fluffy thing, just there. 

00:22:50
JAMES LAWLEY (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Oh, okay. And a future me is (crosstalk)saying, "Just be aware; you'll be in a different space." So when a future me says, "Be aware" and a sister and a father give their blessing and her mother is encouraging, is there anything else that needs to happen before you're ready? 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)It's a bit higher . . . Uh, I just got everybody there that I'm fond of sort of sitting behind me, saying, "Go ahead. We support you. Everything's fine.", as if everyone knows it's a bit for me to do it. 

00:23:35
JAMES LAWLEY So they're all behind and supporting. So is there anything else that needs to happen? 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN Well, you're very thorough. I mean, I wouldn't have um, kept checking, you know, but maybe I'm a bit quick to do things like that, so now I'm just checking that the ground beneath me is nice and solid and clean and clear, and it is. 

00:24:05
JAMES LAWLEY So when the ground is solid and clean and clear and all the fre-, supporter friends are supporting behind and her future self is saying, "Okay, well, be aware," and her sister and her father are giving their blessing and her mother is encouraging and her way station's over there, how will you know when you're ready? 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Okay, then I get the final "Do it" from on high, and that's when I know everything's there. 

00:24:40
JAMES LAWLEY The final (crosstalk)"Do it" from . . . 

00:24:40
PENNY TOMPKINS (crosstalk)""Do it" on high"" . . . 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:45
JAMES LAWLEY So . . . And is there anything else that needs to happen before you get the final "Do it" from on high? 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN I don't think so. 

00:25:00
JAMES LAWLEY So can you do it? 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, now I can. 

00:25:05
JAMES LAWLEY To take all the time you need? 

00:25:05
Metaphors Changing fluffy stuff my space icy bar strands scooped shape 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN I'm getting a bit of assistance. People are reaching and kind of easing bits of it. They're not just watching and letting me do it on my own. In fact, it's a bit of a party. It's a bit like when the Berlin Wall came down, not that people would keep pieces as souvenirs. So it's just breaking away . . . 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN . . . and uh, it's just being gathered up, like over there and um, taken to the way station and it's getting lighter in here, in my uh, space, as in, uh, brighter. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN And now this thing is thing is starting to shift a bit, ease a bit. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, so it's gone now and there's just a few little bits that will kind of flow away. 

00:26:50
PENNY TOMPKINS And it's gone now; there are just a few little bits. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:55
PENNY TOMPKINS And when it's gone and a few little bits, what happens to strands? 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Those strands are kind of bending a bit now. They're sort of saying, "Can we go?" 

00:27:15
PENNY TOMPKINS "We want a break." 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think they've been held kind of strong and firm for a long time, so they're just beginning to relax. 

00:27:25
PENNY TOMPKINS And the strands are beginning to relax? Then what happens? 

00:27:30
Change Interrupted unsure scooped shape 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN So then there's a, there's a sort of shifting of this thing, but it's a little bit like tremors before an earthquake. Uh, I suppose its foundations are quite deep in me, and um, so maybe they're just preparing for the impact of coming out, but maybe it needs to really shake deep down to get it out, and the icy bar is still icy, but it's okay. I didn't want to touch it before because it was icy and cold and wet, but . . . I have a feeling it's going to be handed to someone now, that icy bar. Um, I think there are people coming for the whole thing, actually, so the only bit I'm unsure about is where it links in with me, what's going to happen . . . 

00:28:40
PENNY TOMPKINS The tremors? 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN . . . when they take it out. 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:50
Change Interrupted worrying unsure scooped shape 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, so that bit's worrying me a bit now, in there. It's like this is sort of ready to go and there, just, hands of nice people waiting to move it gently and kindly, but um, I don't know quite how to deal with that. I feel like I need a (ph)resource or something to deal with this bit. 

00:29:15
JAMES LAWLEY So what would you like to have happen when they're ready to take that? 

00:29:20
Conditions for Change 2 fill up space pink & oozy undo valve friends family ground on high want it future self 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Um, I'd like to know there's something that would fill up this space that it will leave, that will kind of come in from behind, where the shape is. 

00:29:35
JAMES LAWLEY You'd like to know there's something that will come in from behind to fill up the space? So what kind of something could that something be that could fill up that space? 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN It's sort of pink and oozy stuff, a bit like uh, sort of uh, sort of like a sweets mixture or something. It's the kind of thing a little girl would think was nice, so uh . . . Uh, it's not my idea of heaven, but there (ph)it (ph)here and it's quite pale pink, a little bit like my top. Um . . . 

00:30:10
JAMES LAWLEY Pale, pink, and oozy? 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN And I have a feeling that when the thing came in, or when I put it there, "Okay, I put this thing there to stop me feeling those really strong feelings you can get here, and so whatever was there got sort of oozed out into the back and it's kind of held in something, so I need to know that, as this comes out, this can safely, just, release back in, um, and that's fine. I just need to kind of undo the little (ph)valve that was whatever it was that I'd kept it safely back there with. I've had that thing back there all the time. I don't know. Okay, so again, again, I'm kind of keen to sort of, you know, make it happen. Maybe I need a bit of checking, like you asked me before. 

00:31:10
PENNY TOMPKINS And what needs to happen for you to safely that valve so pink and oozy can safely come in? 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay, so I need the support of friends now, who are behind, to just really hold me like a little girl needs to be held; you know, one on the knee and on the hands and the shoulder and they'll just make sure everything's really okay, cuz it might be a bit scary for me when that thing comes out and the stuff comes back in. 

00:31:50
PENNY TOMPKINS And is there anything else that you need? 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN If I knew enough, it's . . . I don't want my family involved. They know this is not to do with them. It's too complicated if it has to do with them. This is just my immediate support network. Um, so they're all graciously just turning to one side of it, knowing it's not to do with them. Uh, I think that's what I need, and that the ground is nice and solid again. (crosstalk)(inaudible) 

00:32:30
PENNY TOMPKINS (crosstalk)Is, is the ground nice and solid? 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, but it's dear. It's like marble now. It's cooler and smoother. Uh, and the on-high are down here now anyway, so uh . . . Yeah, I think that's it then. I haven't done it yet, but . . . 

00:32:55
JAMES LAWLEY So what's the first thing that needs to happen? 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Well, it's a bit of a uh, delicate operation. I need to be sure this thing is ready to come out, but before it does, all this stuff, the pink oozy stuff, is ready to come through and then release the valve very gently, gently, gently, so that's that comes out, this is already coming in, so there's no gap. Um, okay. 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN And, again, I think I have to want it to happen. (ph)Might (ph)not . . . Future self is just sort of saying, "Uh, just remember, it makes, it changes things. It's okay, it's fine, but it does change things." 

00:33:45
JAMES LAWLEY So you've got to want it to happen? 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:50
JAMES LAWLEY And do you want it to happen? 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I do, even though I'm a bit trepidatious. 

00:34:00
JAMES LAWLEY You want it even though you're trepidatious a bit? 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I definitely don't want this thing anymore. And the strands are really like, "Come on!" 

00:34:20
[sil.] 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Uh, okay, so I'm going to, going to do it. So I'm just checking . . . It's okay. It's not gonna fly out. 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:34:40
Change Continues fluffy stuff my space icy bar strands scooped shape 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Okay, so it's, it's doing it. Okay, so far . . . 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN It's happening. It's quite slow, but maybe that's just right, and I'm wanting to sort of run before I can walk, but I know I need to be patient. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Okay, I think this thing is nearly disengaged. Oh yeah, woo! That's a really funny feeling! It must've uh, just . . . Woo! It feels really sort of full here. It made me sit up as if it had kind of - woo - went out under my chin. I can breathe better, definitely. That's a really strange, and a strong sensation. 

00:36:10
JAMES LAWLEY And it goes "woo!"? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, because it uh, filled up. Yeah, and the bag is pretty much empty, so it must've come in with a bit of a surge, so I'm just doing up that valve and the bag's gone, then I'll take off the little thing so that it's not uh, not a way out again. I don't need that anymore. 

00:36:40
[sil.] 

00:36:40
Change Continues fluffy stuff my space icy bar strands 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN So that thing is just being gently taken away, as if from an operating table. The strands have jumped off and they're relieved and have gone off somewhere, and I think (ph)were little people, you know, like little fairies or something, who were stretched really tight holding the (ph)thing, and . . . 

00:37:00
PENNY TOMPKINS They're gonna go to bed. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, they're like . . . And uh, they were probably playing with me at the time when it happened, you know? They didn't know they were in for a sort of 33 year stretch, literally. 

00:37:10
Change Continues fluffy stuff my space icy bar 

00:37:15
PENNY TOMPKINS And then what happens? 

00:37:15
Change Continues fluffy stuff my space 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN So uh, so all of that stuff's moving away. I don't know what the icy bar was for. I don't suppose it matters now. My sister and my mom and dad are not quite looking around yet. I think they just know this is my thing. My friends, my supportive group are all, still all around me, the ground's good and it feels good. I'm quite mystified; I don't know what it is, even though I had some understanding. The fluffy stuff, I guess, is over there. I don't . . . I'm not interested anymore. In fact, I think it's gone. I think my mom might be edging it towards her, to look at it and then maybe discard it. So, yeah, I think she's quite interested, looking at that now, uh, and that's nice for me. Um . . . Yeah. 

00:38:25
Change Continues my space 

00:38:30
JAMES LAWLEY And so then when a mum is quite interested in looking at it, that's nice for you, and that's been taken away and that's full and you can breathe . . . What's happened to that space? 

00:38:45
Change Continues my calm space 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Ah, become space . . . Well, uh, it feels very new, but it feels like it's is mine and that's more important than anything, so that I could sit with a space and know that it's mine, and then it's easier to make choices - "Shall I do this or shall I do that?" - and if I wanted to make a choice to do something that might make me late, that would be my choice. Chances are I wouldn't actually want to do that, uh, so rather than just feeling sort of blinkered and like I don't know what I'm doing and "Oh no, now I'm late," um, that it's easier to just sit in my space and know what to do, step by step, one at a time. 

00:39:40
PENNY TOMPKINS And when there's choice and your space, where is your future self? 

00:39:50
Change Continues my calm space future self 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Ah. I think she's come in here, cuz she wasn't far ahead, that particular one. She's here, and there's, (ph)she's another one down there and there and there and there and there, so there's lots of them; that's nice, and I can see them, whereas, perhaps, I couldn't see them before. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:15
New Metaphor way to go my own path future self solid 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's like there's a, there's a way for me to go, and mum's there and that's very nice and my sister's there and my dad's there, and uh, they know I'm here and I have my own path to go on. 

00:40:35
JAMES LAWLEY And that's a way for you to go on your own path? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, and she's nice, you know? I like her; she's solid. Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to go where she's going. 

00:40:50
JAMES LAWLEY So is there anything else about that way or that path or where she's going? 

00:40:55
New Metaphor way to go my own path clear and open future self solid 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Uh, it's a little black and white is the only thing I'd say. Uh, and maybe that will, uh, change when I get a bit more used to this place. I just saw it kind of tint a little bit into color and back again as if they're just showing me "Oh, it's okay," you know, "This will, uh, this will warm up, open up a bit and you'll get used to where you are." Either way, it's clear and it's open and there's nothing in the way. 

00:41:40
JAMES LAWLEY And so when it's clear and it's open and there's nothing in the way and that's where she's going and you're happy to go there, what happens to being late? 

00:41:55
New Metaphor way to go my own path clear and open moving forward future self solid 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Wow, uh, well, she certainly doesn't want to be late. I feel I wanna go there, so I wouldn't want to be late; I wouldn't even need to be late cuz moving forward is not a problem, so maybe I always moved a bit laterally to kind of avoid something. Uh, I'm interested to go there. 

00:42:25
JAMES LAWLEY So it's a bit new, this, and you're interested to go and there's nothing to avoid being late, and so is there anything else that you need right now, into, in relation to why you can? 

00:42:45
Change Interrupted legs worried moving forward 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Um, yeah, I just need to know that my legs work properly. They're like . . . Below the knee, they're a bit and I'm a bit worried that they won't actually go there. 

00:43:00
JAMES LAWLEY Yeah, so the legs below the knee are a bit worried? 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, they're a bit scared. 

00:43:10
JAMES LAWLEY So whereabouts are they're a bit scared? 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN Well, (ph)down (ph)on the inside's tingling, and she's got trousers on with a sort of cow hide patting on them. I have to tell you that. I don't know why Uh, maybe it just means something strong, and uh, so I'm a little bit scared. Uh, so what was I looking at? What . . . Is there anything else that needs to happen? 

00:43:50
JAMES LAWLEY Uh-huh. 

00:43:50
Conditions for Change 3 assistance to get up & go support family stand tall ok to be that person 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN I just need to know that I have the assistance, I think, uh, to get up and go that way, yeah. 

00:44:05
PENNY TOMPKINS And what needs to happen for you to know you have the assistance to get up and go that way? 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN I think I like to know that that support is behind me, uh, and that my family are there in their right places, uh, and maybe that they don't try to stop me, uh . . . 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN . . . and that it's okay, I think, to stand tall with this thing. I think maybe that's it. I wasn't used to that cuz when I had that there was a, some problems that I had to get ride a bit, so I think it's that more than anything. 

00:44:55
PENNY TOMPKINS That you can stand tall? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Stand (crosstalk)taught, yeah, yeah, and not be afraid. I think I was a bit afraid of uh, who I was, that little girl who just said, "No!", and to my own mother, so I think I need to know that it's okay, uh, to be that person with that thing. Uh, so yeah . . . But they're staying there, you know, they're not looking aghast or anything. 

00:45:30
PENNY TOMPKINS (crosstalk)(ph)With (ph)that? 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN So I don't know what else I'm meant to be looking at now. I feel a bit lost - fine - but um, now, I think I can see myself walking there now. I think I just had to check that out cuz it was worrying me. 

00:45:55
PENNY TOMPKINS And what happens to the tingling below the knees? 

00:46:00
Change Continues legs more solid being bigger taller fuller getting up hedging that way we're off 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Uh, it's still there. It's getting more solid. It's like when uh, tingling starts to go, um, yeah, it's just getting used to that new feeling of being bigger and taller and fuller. 

00:46:25
PENNY TOMPKINS And as tingling starts to go and become more solid, then what happens? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Then I see myself getting up out of the chair, which is good, cuz I wasn't sure I was going to, uh, and I'm just hedging that way and I could keep looking up at my mom and my sister and my dad and looking behind and they're all trotting along behind, which is nice, but they're staying where they are, and I'm surprised that that's so important, but it is, uh, so I think we're off, me and my friends, you know? Um . . . 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's like uh, where we left off. That's what it feels like. It's like, "Oh yeah, that's been a really long time of uh, in suspended animation, you know, in some area. Yeah, it feels fun, feels like uh, following the yellow brick road. 

00:47:40
PENNY TOMPKINS And what happens to stand tall when it's like following the yellow brick road? 

00:47:50
New Metaphor following the yellow brick road stand tall relax 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Um, stand tall feels very good. It feels like uh, I'll be able to stand tall but relaxed, muscles, like, in my shoulder and back that I've held very tight for a long time, (ph)except (ph)for it will be much easier to just stand tall, but relaxed. 

00:48:10
JAMES LAWLEY And so when it's, it will be easier to stand tall and relax and it's like res-, resuming, uh, lay, where you left off and along the yellow brick road and your future self with cow hide trousers . . . And so is there anything else you need right now about getting clarity on why you were always late? 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Um, no. I, I understand. Whatever all that was, I understand. 

00:49:05
[sil.] 

00:49:10
PENNY TOMPKINS Thank you. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:49:15
JAMES LAWLEY So, and so what time do you need to leave here in order to not be late for your next appointment? 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Oh, in about 10 minutes. 

00:49:25
JAMES LAWLEY 10 minutes? Right. Well, you've got 10 minutes. Thank you. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:49:35
[music] 

00:49:35
Immediately after the session 

00:49:40
JAMES LAWLEY So is there anything you'd like to say about what it was like to experience, uh, going through that? 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Um, well, it was uh, it was sort of delicious because I didn't know what it was, you know? I knew there was something there, but it was intangible, for me, and I was thinking, "Well, you know, I can see the shapes, I can see these things, but I don't know how it's gonna help me with uh, being late. Um, but then I could feel "Oh, now we're really getting into something", uh, so then, you know, when I could see it just coming in, those images and the sensations and the memories of a little girl with her mom and I says, "Ah!", so it was very interesting and nice to have ways to deal with those images and sensations I was getting, to have the steering and guidance of the questions, because I didn't know what I was doing. I was just sitting here as a little girl, (ph)old (ph)me, with these things, like I've been all my life. I didn't know what to do with it. And so each time you say, uh, "Is there anything else you need?", it's like, gosh, you know, like I said, I think you're, you're really thorough about (ph)check-up. "Well, yeah, he's good," you know, "Okay, yeah, I'll look at this and that." I wouldn't have done that. I would've just steamed in and uh, so it was just very nice to have that, that uh, steering, um, and of course, the questions, uh, uh, evoke a response and suddenly there it is. Uh, so I found it immensely helpful to just be carried through that thing, to discover it and then know what to do with it and then have some sense of where to go. 

00:51:40
JAMES LAWLEY And when you're not late, what are you when you're not late? 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN When I'm not late? Oh, I'm really calm and happy. I really like it, uh, but it's only happened about three times in my life, so I've not got much to draw upon. 

00:52:00
JAMES LAWLEY Right. Well . . . So it'd be interesting to find out (crosstalk)what happens. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Yes, it will, and I'm not gonna put pressure on myself, I know, because I'm too fond whatever this thing is that's come back to start testing it and judging it like a teacher. Um, but yes, it will definitely be interesting. 

00:52:25
[music] 

00:52:25
4 months later 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Um, okay, so shall I just start chatting and see what happens? 

00:52:35
PENNY TOMPKINS Yeah. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Okay. So in the four months we did the session in August, there have been a lot of huge, dramatic changes in my life, and I can think back to the end of the session where my future self was warning me that if I did certain things there would be changes in my life, big changes, and I remember feeling that and thinking, "Ooh, I wonder what that means," but not really having any sense of it and within five weeks I had a met a man who is, feels like my life partner, who absolutely love and adore, and it had been four years since I had any relationship, so I'm sure that is not unconnected, and even though I was doing a lot of um, quite intense sort of therapy which will have influenced my life, I feel this was definitely a significant, um, part of that process, um, and, and soon after that I was singing at the Royal Opera House, which was probably - no, maybe they hadn't even been arranged by then - I think a few days after the session - that's right - I was asked to do, um, to perform at the Royal Opera House, which could've been extremely frightening, and wasn't, and I just loved it, and I know that the, the scoopy out shape thing that got refilled was very significant for me. I don't really understand what that was, but the day we did the session, um, I had to go and sing in Brixton, and it was quite a challenging venue. It was a bit rough, and we got there, my friend and I had just thought, "Oh, I don't know about this," um, but, in fact, my friends who'd asked me to sing there said, "Oh no, go on, go on. They'd love you to sing," so we thought, "Well, okay" and, um, and I was very aware of my, my middle, and I just thought, "Okay, I'm gonna stand tall and sing and shine out" and, and I did. I could do it. It wasn't a strain of me thinking, "Oh, I must try and keep myself together." It was just there, and I could feel it very clearly beaming out to everyone, and I thought, "Oh, okay. Something has really shifted there," and I was really noticing it because it was that same day, so that was very interesting for me. 

00:55:05
Being late? 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN And in terms of being late for things and time-keeping, I wouldn't say, "That's gone; I'm never late anymore," um, and, in any case, there was so much else in the session that was much more significant than that. I feel like the lateness is just a consequence of, of, of the situation that I had before that has been shifted, so, now, rather than panicking and feeling desperate and lost and caught in the muddled thinking about being late, I'm much more in control of, "Okay, in order to be somewhere on time, for myself, to keep myself calm, I need to do this, this, and this by a certain time and have such and such ready," and I'm much more in control of that and so even if I am a bit late for something I don't panic and feel blinded with worry and think, "Oh my God!", you know, "What does this mean? I'm so bad." I would just think, "Okay, perhaps ring them, say I'm late," so things are just much calmer and more settled, much more in my control. I think that's what I really like. 

00:56:15
Mother? 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Um, my relationship with my mother has changed. It's subtle and it's ongoing, but it's there, and I think she has felt it, and we're just making, you know, small shifts as changes happen for me, and there are many aspects of this new relationship I'm in that could be quite challenging for her, but, actually, she's dealing with it extremely well and I feel we're much more two adults with a much clearer identity who can talk to each other and negotiate to reassure each other, um, and that feels much more comfortable, so within my family, I feel my place is much clearer. I have a much stronger sense of my own identity, and even though that's not necessarily very comfortable, um, are not always comfortable, easy is there, and I, if I have to make decisions that aren't that easy, that's okay, um, because I know where I am and I know what my place is, and I think I felt that strongly at the end of the session. I can't even remember what was happening, but it's when my sister and my father were here and my mother was there and it was something I had to do myself. It might be when the pink, the oozy stuff was coming back. I'm not sure, but, um, I knew that they were respecting my place in the family and, and I can remember you nodding wisely at me when I was, um, saying I need, they're all turning away and letting me do this on my own and I, it was like a surprise to me, as if, for the first time, I understood that I did have a place on my own. I think I hadn't got that, I hadn't understood it, um, so that's been very, very nice for me, um, and I think that's, that's, essentially, where I am now with it. 

00:58:15
PENNY TOMPKINS Thank you.
