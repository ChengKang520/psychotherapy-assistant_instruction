Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 Email info@emicrotraining.com Website www.emicrotraining.com © 2007 Microtraining Associates presents BASIC ATTENDING SKILLS (4th Edition) Allen E. Ivey, Norma Gluckstern Packard, Mary Bradford Ivey, Deryl F. Bailey, and Azara Santiago-Rivera (Featuring Kendra Lyons) Introduction to Microcounseling: The Importance of the Client's Story Allen E. Ivey 

00:00:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Welcome. I really appreciate your participation in this series. Basic attending skills is concerned with presenting the most important aspects of interviewing, counseling and psychotherapy. You can't help a client unless you've heard the story, you've heard what they have to say. Now in microcounseling we break down the interviewing skills one by one in a systematic process so that you can really encounter and deal with these skills in a way that isn't all at once helping. I remember when I learned counseling - I went from theory to practice and I was very puzzled when I got with that first client. And I feel kind of sorry for that first client to be frank with you. Basic attending skills are designed to give you a systematic way to practice these skills that is safe for you and your client. In effect let's prepare before we get with the real hardcore action. So what we'd like to do in this tape is break down skills one by one and ask you to practice them. You're going to see a number of videotapes. Each one has a single skill which we know is important to the counseling process. There's been extensive research, but even more important is the way you, you apply them in clinical practice. Now I'd like to share with you what you're going to work through in this series. 

00:01:55
Key Skills for Mastering the Basic Microcounseling Techniques 

00:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Research has shown that the basic microcounseling model is a most effective route toward master of the skills. In each skill we suggest the following as you approach each skill. 

00:02:05
Read and learn abut the specific skill. 

00:02:05
ALLEN E. IVEY First, prepare through reading and lectures. Know something about the video before you watch it. Read about the skill or listen to your instructor tell you about what you're going to see. If you know where you're going, you're going to learn more. 

00:02:20
View a video, analyze what you see. 

00:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Two, view the videotape and analyze it. What do you like? What might you want to change? Just because you're seeing a tape doesn't mean it's totally perfect. These are tapes for discussion and for learning more. 

00:02:35
Practice, Practice, Practice 

00:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Practice. This is the most important part. Actually practice the single skill that you've just seen. And that means ideally before videotape yourself or audiotape, get feedback from other people so you get some idea that you begin to have a sense of master of the skill. 

00:02:55
Record practice sessions, obtain feedback. 

00:02:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Fourthly, record that practice tape with audiotape or videotape. Obtain feedback. I say it twice because I think its so important. 

00:03:00
Generalize skills to the real world. 

00:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Five, generalize to the real world. Skills that are learned in the classroom don't necessarily apply when you go out in the real world. But we have found if you're willing to take these skills out and use them in the interview, your practice is going to improve. So welcome to what we think is the basis of counseling and psychotherapy. Its only a beginning, its ultimately going to be your skills, your way of doing it. We look forward to hearing from you and getting lots of feedback. Good luck. 

00:03:40
Attending Behavior Introduction: Deryl Bailey 

00:03:45
DERYL BAILEY The first thing a helper needs to do is listen to the client. But what is listening. Our first video will show what listening is not. I'm going to demonstrate behaviors that illustrate poor listening skills. As you watch the video listen to what Allen does wrong. Perhaps make a list of what not to do. The second demonstration will show the difference between positive and negative attending. 

00:04:15

00:04:20
Ineffective Listening Allen Ivey and Azara Santiago-Rivera As you observe this video, make notes of what is done incorrectly. 

00:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Hi Azara, you wanted to talk about something today. 

00:04:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes I do. I've come to you because there's been an incident at my job a couple of days ago. And I'm kind of upset about it. 

00:04:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So what kind of job do you have? 

00:04:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well right now I'm, I'm an assistant manager for a company and I've worked at this company for 15 years. 

00:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So after 15 years you're still an assistant. 

00:04:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah I'm still an assistant after 15 years. But what I want to talk to you about is I was passed over for a promotion. 

00:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you tell me a little bit more about, ah, meanwhile some of the things you might have been doing wrong? 

00:05:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well I don't think I did anything wrong. I've gotten very good feedback from... 

00:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Well they don't usually pass people up for promotions unless they're not performing up to standards. 

00:05:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But I think I have. I've had great evaluations. My supervisor has always giving me positive feedback about the kind of work I do. So it's just not fair. 

00:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So what can we do? maybe one thing we can do in here is sort of help you find new ways to work along with your boss. 

00:05:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But I really do get along… 

00:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY We have some training programs in terms of helping you get along. 

00:05:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But Allen I get along with my boss. Now I'm frustrated. 

00:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Well I can imagine that you're frustrated. But I think you're going to have to face the fact there's some things we're going to have to do to work this through. 

00:06:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I really don't think that that's the issue. The issue is that I was passed over for a promotion and I was I was next in line and it just didn't happen. 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Well I've heard that story before. 

00:06:10
Stop the Video What do you see wrong here? 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:25
Azara Gives Allen Feedback 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Azara how was that demonstration for you. Even though you know it was a role-play? 

00:06:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well I felt like you were interrupting me a couple of times, so it was very hard to get my story out. And ah… I got a little frustrated because you were kind of taking it in a direction that I didn't want to go with that. I wanted to talk to you about the promotion, about being passed over. 

00:06:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I was taking on my agenda rather than following with your agenda. 

00:06:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes… yes and it was very clear that the questions were just not letting me kind of talk about the situation. So… 

00:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY In the process, did you notice anything about my body language? 

00:07:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You looked away, very little eye contact, you kind of moved a lot. Like you were not very interested in what I had to say and I think that that actually made me want to move as well, so you know kind of move in different directions because I didn't think that you were really paying attention. So… 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, so I think is there anything else you might want to add, I think we've hit the highlights or low lights maybe… 

00:07:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think it worked out real well. 

00:07:40
Positive Attending Example 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hi Azara. 

00:07:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hi Allen, how are you? 

00:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Nice to see you. 

00:07:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Thank you, nice to see you too. 

00:07:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Thanks for coming in. 

00:07:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Thanks. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Azara, I've been looking at your file and I see that you'd like to talk a little bit about a problem on the job. Is that right? 

00:08:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes that's right. 

00:08:00
Informing client 

00:08:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But before we start ah… there's a couple of things I'd like to talk about. One of them is that anything that goes on in here is confidential and this particular interview I'm taping because I do get some supervision. So is it okay to make a tape and if you feel any time you want to turn the tape off I would turn it off, is that okay? 

00:08:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh sure that's fine. 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And if it makes you uncomfortable and some people can, but usually it's there and sometimes I'll give you the tape to take home and look at. 

00:08:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:08:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Another issue as we start, everything is confidential, and its not to be shared, except something where you might… there's always that issue of legal confidentiality should you hurt somebody or indicate problems over, not an issue I think we need to share that as well. And then another thing as we start is that "hey" I'm a White male, you're from Puerto Rico, and… and a woman. What are your thoughts about working with me? 

00:09:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I'm glad you brought that up because that's the first thing that came to mind when ah… when I asked about who I could talk to about ah… about my problem. And when your name was mentioned I thought oh… my goodness is he going to understand. 

00:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm… 

00:09:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So I'm glad you brought it up. I think that that helps me a little bit. Well what do you know about… about our culture? 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I've been lucky enough to be down in Puerto Rico actually four times. And I've even been over to Ponce, I've been there all basically to three of the four corners of Puerto Rico 

00:09:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh that's great. 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And I've done some work down there and had a number of… of Puerto Ricans with whom I worked and Puerto Ricans whom I've counseled. So I… I do probably know something about it, but perhaps you might want to ask me more. 

00:09:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay, well that's a good start. Thanks for sharing that. I think that that helps me a little bit and I think I can kind of begin to talk to you a little bit about what's going on. 

00:09:55
What are your thoughts about this sharing? 

00:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So if there's issues of feeling along the way I want you to know to feel free to ask me a question at any time. 

00:10:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:10:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So there is a concern on the job. I'd like to hear about it. 

00:10:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay, well I ah… ah a few days ago, ah… I found out that I was passed over for a promotion… 

00:10:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm hmm 

00:10:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA …at my job. And this is ah I've been with this company for fifteen years. 

00:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Fifteen years. 

00:10:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I was really pretty upset when I first found out, because the person who got the job, first of all is a male, he's only been with the company for five years. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So the guy that got the job is a male and been there just fifteen… been there just five years. 

00:10:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Just five years. And you know I think I'm much better qualified than… than he is for this position. I've gotten really good ah… evaluations from my supervisor, I have a great working relationship with my colleagues. 

00:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And you know I'm like I was completely shocked to… to find out that I didn't get this promotion. Because I was actually encouraged to ah… to apply for this job. And you know I didn't get it. This is… is just really, I'm just, I'm really… really angry. 

00:11:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Really… really angry. And what I've heard is what makes you angry is that you've had a good record, you were even asked to apply for this job… 

00:11:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY …and finally this White male hasn't been there that long… quite long gets the job. What do you think is going on? 

00:11:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well I think I it's… I think it's discrimination. 

00:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You do? 

00:11:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I do. Now the problem I'm having ah… Allen is that I think it is. I think its discrimination but now I have to decide what I'm going to do. If I'm going to file a complaint… 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA …and the consequences of filing a complaint, you know will that upset my colleagues, will that you know get my boss, ah… my supervisor you know upset with me. I'm really worried about the consequences. I don't want to lose my job, but I think its discrimination. 

00:11:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Other people I've talked with too, it's a tough decision to make. Ah… if you file, you know you set yourself up for a lot of hassles, if you don't file, then you're stuck with your anger and frustration. Could you tell me a bit more about that dilemma you feeling. 

00:12:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well its ah… you know its like I'm, I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. Ah… on the one hand I think it's important to file the complaint… 

00:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm… 

00:12:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA …because I think it will show the company that you know they really need to think about diversity in the work workforce, and I'm kind of tired of being the only Latina working in this company for as long as I have, when you know they need to they need to do something different. So I'm, I'm torn between that and I don't want to lose my job because I'm afraid of losing my job. 

00:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm… hmm. So you're angry, afraid, frustrated. A lot of stuff comes together for you all at once. 

00:12:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, that's right. And I don't know what to do about that. 

00:12:55
STOP THE VIDEO What is Allen doing differently from the first example? 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
Interview continues with search for strengths: the positive asset search 

00:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing I heard you saying was ah… I'd like to understand little bit more though you had good evaluations, you say you have good relationships, ah… success, a reasonable rate of promotion, I mean at least races et cetera along the line. I'd just like to hear at this point, I kind of had a general issue of your background and some of the problems you have, I'd like to just hear a little bit about give me an example of something ah… more specific example something that's gone right ah… in the past. Something you're proud of. Because when a person talks only about difficulties, it kind of makes them feel a little unbalanced and I'd like to understand some of your strengths. 

00:13:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I've got a general understanding of your problem. I want to come back to that. Could you tell me a little bit about some of your strengths too. 

00:13:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, ah… I recently ah… completed ah… my major project… 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:14:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And ah… you know my supervisor really liked the quality of the work that I produced. So that's really that's really one really positive thing that that happened a month ago. And that actually is related to why I decided to apply for the promotion because I got such a good you know good feedback about this report that I completed. 

00:14:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So your supervisor said you did good things, did your supervisor support your application for this promotion? 

00:14:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, but obviously my supervisor doesn't have a lot of clout within the company. 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I guess I'm going to ask the obvious question. Have you talked with your supervisor about this issue yet? 

00:14:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA No not yet. 

00:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Not yet. So that's a piece of data that where he is and where he stands on this… 

00:14:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY But before you do anything you really need to sort out more what's going on. 

00:14:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. Absolutely. 

00:14:55
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing I'd like to do is ah… is ah… focus on some of your strengths and good qualities and what has gone really well on the job. And on the basis of those strengths I think I'll have little better understanding of what you can do. And the promotion, one of the issues in dealing with promotions sometimes is not just an attack, but did they miss something. And I think I can understand you and understand the issues better if you know a little bit more about some of those strengths. Can you tell me about one more thing that you've done right? 

00:15:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I've been, I've ah… you know I'm well organized in… in my work you know my work space. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I tend to… I always turn in assignments on time, tasks that I have to do. I also think that I maintain a sense of collegiality in the office. 

00:15:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know people you know I try to keep people on good spirits, I mean I worry about my colleagues. 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY A spark plug for the whole organization. 

00:16:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But that's part of me, that's who I am, so and I… I think those are strengths. 

00:16:10
Having heard strengths, Allen returns to the central issue 

00:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm. So I hear those good strengths ah… now I'd like to identify those a little bit more precisely. But let's go back to the difficulties. And ah… do you sense anywhere, they give you any specific feedback about why you didn't get the job? 

00:16:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, ah… no not yet. I know they haven't really been clear to me as to why I didn't get the promotion. 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So maybe that's one area that needs to be clarified as why I didn't get the promotion from their perspective. Right? 

00:16:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm. From your perspective its pretty clear. 

00:16:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It's pretty clear to me. That why I think I need to file a complaint, but I'm scared to death of doing it and I'm very, very angry. 

00:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm. So I hear that… I really hear that urgency to file a complaint, ah… are there timelines you need to consider for that complaint? 

00:17:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah… yeah I'd like to do it within the next two months. 

00:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Next two months? 

00:17:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA …and the sooner the better I think, but I need I need help sorting that out. 

00:17:10
Allen focuses on emotion 

00:17:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm. At the same time you're really, really angry, frustrated and so forth. 

00:17:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, very. 

00:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY How is that how is that frustration, anger, eating on you? What's happening with you? 

00:17:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh, I can't sleep. 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Can't sleep. 

00:17:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I haven't been able to eat very well. You know, I… I'm tense. Its really… I have to make a decision soon because I don't like the way I feel. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, so this is an interesting and important beginning and I think we have a long way to go. And we've got to do it fairly quickly, right? 

00:17:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes we do. 

00:17:45
Summary of the interview so far 

00:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So what I really heard is that so far is you've got a lot of strengths, ah… good record, good evaluations, ah… over time you've got support from your boss, all the time he encouraged you to do it. At the same time boom, you thought the job was yours and zap here comes in a White male, five years experience, his job not yours and you're really angry and frustrated. Is that the story pretty well? 

00:18:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You have it right, that's exactly how… 

00:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Anything particularly important that I've missed. 

00:18:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA No I think you covered the essence of it. Thanks. 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY We can consider this is a beginning. 

00:18:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

00:18:25
Azara gives Allen feedback 

00:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Azara was I able to listen to your story this time? 

00:18:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh yes, ah… ah… a real big difference I think. Ah… you know you were really paying attention. 

00:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm. 

00:18:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I felt that you were really with me. You really captured the… the kind of the essence of… of the situation. And you were attending to my feelings. I mean you really weren't… and your body language was like you were really there. 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I even kind of felt some of the anger and frustration in my own body. I don't know if I showed it, but I felt it. 

00:19:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. Well I could really tell the difference. 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So you thought you did get your story out there. Eye contact was better. 

00:19:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And you felt you were listened to. 

00:19:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes I did. 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Great. How did you feel about that beginning thing where I sort of asked you some questions about how you felt working with me as a White male and so forth? 

00:19:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well I… I certainly appreciate bringing it forward, or at least talking about it early on immediately. 

00:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think its important to address that because as ah… as a Latino its… its… its you know its certainly present in my life every day and I know that ah… you know its important to address this when you are talking to someone, especially when you are going to engage in a counseling session. To get that issue upfront right away. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. So that that made it more comfortable. 

00:19:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think it did. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I think its one thing that a lot of counselors are hesitant to share this, but the general feeling seems to be shared up front… 

00:20:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

00:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY …and be as open as you can. 

00:20:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think so… I think that… that really breaks the ice and if there are differences they are handled at the very beginning and you start off on the right foot, as I would say. So I appreciate that. 

00:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And then sort of provide an opportunity for the client to ask you questions at the beginning. 

00:20:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Absolutely. Yeah. 

00:20:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I think it was different… goes away from lots of counseling theory where you grew up with, but things are changing. 

00:20:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think so too. I think the other thing that I appreciated was that you disclosed a little bit about yourself at the beginning, and ah… that too is something that we're not trained to do, we're trained to be very guarded and careful of what we say. And you were very frank about this, so I appreciate that. I think that really opened the opportunity for me to talk to you. 

00:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Thanks very much. 

00:20:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You're welcome. 

00:20:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And now I'd like to follow that up with ah… what I would call the positive asset so I kind of moved in from the introduction to the problem to ah… tell me more about your strengths and one thing I'd like to do is focus on clients strengths and wellness because you really solve problems on the basis of strength and its kind of the attention I'd like to have in my own interviews is to bring out the strengths and then when you get the strengths I think we can go little deeper… 

00:21:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY …into the issue so how would you feel about me brining up some of those most positive aspects of your ah… life in work. 

00:21:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well ah… considering that ah… I you know that I I've been having this problem at working I've been angry and upset and it's been eating away at me that… 

00:21:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know you lose ah I lost sight of ah… of the positive things or the… the important contributions that I've made ah… in my job so the fact that you're focused on that helped me kind of bring that back to focus which I think is important because I think that… that helped me think about it's like building strength. It helped me realize that there are ways in which I can handle this on my own by focusing on those strengths. So that's actually I think very productive. 

00:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It is very productive. 

00:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I would have given me more time, I'd like to do a real strength inventory of finding out all of the positives your allies these types of strengths. Also I think it'll be really useful to go back into some of the more frustrations and problems you might have had overtime on the job. Ah… I'm sure there wasn't ah… at least I'm guessing it wasn't the first time that you ran into trouble on a gender or ah… ethnic issue. 

00:22:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right and that's, that's something that we probably would need to explore ah… more in depth but certainly that's the case. 

00:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So we're gonna solve a major problem like ah… discrimination at the workplace, we need to hear the issue of the immediate issue, we need to hear some strengths we need to hear not just about this one precipitating issue we need to hear about some other ones as well. 

00:22:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Absolutely. 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And then once we've understand the full story we'll be better able to act. But that means a lot of listening to the client in the client's point of view. 

00:23:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes it does and I felt that you were really with me you were paying attention to… to my telling the story. That's great. Yeah. 

00:23:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Anything else you'd like to share? 

00:23:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA No I think that we've captured it all. 

00:23:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Right thanks Azara. 

00:23:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You're welcome. 

00:23:20
Multicultural Feedback Azara, Allen, and Deryl 

00:23:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Well we've just done the attending behavior video and I was wondering ah… what the multicultural differences we might want to think about in this, because I know there are a lot of different ways to attend than just the verbal, straightforward trunk mania, eye contact and so forth that I demonstrated. Deryl… 

00:23:45
DERYL BAILEY Well I think in general for African Americans or Blacks whichever you prefer, the… the proximity being too close ah can be problematic because that's sort of an invasion of space which I for one tend to like to protect sort of after myself. But also being too far away ah… means that you're not sitting(ph) and not interested. And the other piece of me is about eye contact. Directly… directly looking at, at for example an adult as a child wouldn't be considered disrespectful. Ah… but it's also contextual. If I'm being chastised I should look at you in the beginning with that… that conversation because it means I'm paying attention. But to look at you in an evil kind of way means that I'm being disrespectful so you have to sort of engage that piece, but eye contact is important in the African American culture. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY But it will vary with the individual and the situation. 

00:24:30
DERYL BAILEY Absolutely. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Azara. 

00:24:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well first time there are… there are some similarities actually in what Deryl just shared about ah… about ah… about the eye contact and about, about the proximity. How close or how far you should get to someone. Among Latinos though it's very hard to kind of generalize because there's so much diversity within the population. So you know I want to be very careful about generalizing what we're saying about this. But the eye contact issue was important in a sense that you know we've been raised… I have been raised for example to ah… to not look directly at some at an adult figure. This was certainly growing up as a child, because that would be considered challenging authority. 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So the eye contact issue is an interesting one because I think we're raised to be more respectful. 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And then when you're working with a counselor who is in a position of authority, then you tend to maybe look away more often than not. The issue with how close you should get or how far, distance is an interesting phenomena among Latinos, we're very huggie, feely kind of ah… people where we touch a lot, so closeness can mean intimacy, it can mean trusting. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But I think it really depends on the situation. It really depends on the situation. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And as you move to White culture, which I think is an important aspect, ah… its always dangerous to generalize, but there tends to be in general European White culture the issue I know that we are often seen by African-American, Latinos, Asians, sometimes as cold and distant. Our vocal tone tends to be pretty straightforward and level all the time, and not show too much emotion. But again this will vary with the culture, the southern Italian, the Jewish. I come from more a northern European situation. Each one varies, and each person will vary from their style, so we cant absolutely fix it with one person. But there definitely is issues with the White culture as well. 

00:26:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes.

Questions Deryl Bailey and Azara Santiago-Rivera Introduction Mary Bradford Ivey 

00:26:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I did my master's degree at the University of Wisconsin and Carl Rogers visited us often. I learned there that questions were something that we ought not to use as a client needed to be self-directed. Questions certainly can cause problems and put clients on the spot. But they're often necessary to obtain the information and to help the client tell their story. The first example you will see will be the use of closed questions which require a short answer. There you will see that you can obtain some information from the client but they do not ordinarily help clients discuss their issues in sufficient detail.

Closed Questions Deryl Bailey and Kendra Lyons 

00:27:45
DERYL BAILEY Hi Kendra, I understand you wanted to talk to me today. 

00:27:50
KENDRA LYONS Yes. I have a boyfriend now. But he's a lot older than me, not a lot older than me, but my parents hate him. They don't even want me to see him. 

00:27:55
DERYL BAILEY How old is he? 

00:28:00
KENDRA LYONS Twenty-one. 

00:28:00
DERYL BAILEY And how old are you? 

00:28:00
KENDRA LYONS Seventeen. 

00:28:05
DERYL BAILEY So is this something new, does your parents not liking your boyfriend? 

00:28:10
KENDRA LYONS Well they didn't know about it until very recently. 

00:28:15
DERYL BAILEY How long have they known? 

00:28:15
KENDRA LYONS A couple of days. 

00:28:20
DERYL BAILEY You don't like your parents not liking your boyfriend I take it. 

00:28:25
KENDRA LYONS Hmm…hmm… 

00:28:25
DERYL BAILEY So you think your parents should like your boyfriend? 

00:28:30
KENDRA LYONS Yes, I like him. 

00:28:30
DERYL BAILEY No matter how old he is? 

00:28:35
KENDRA LYONS Yes. 

00:28:35
Closed questions bring out information quickly, but lack depth and often put the client on the spot.

Open Questions 

00:28:50
DERYL BAILEY Hi Kendra. 

00:28:50
KENDRA LYONS Hi. 

00:28:50
DERYL BAILEY I understand you wanted to see me today? 

00:28:50
KENDRA LYONS Yes. 

00:28:50
Open question-"can?" 

00:28:55
DERYL BAILEY Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on? 

00:28:55
KENDRA LYONS See it's my new boyfriend. And he's great, but he's a little older than me and my parents they don't like him so much. They would rather like him if they knew him, but they don't like me being with him, just because of how old he is. 

00:29:10
DERYL BAILEY Okay, so it sounds like your, your parents don't mind you having a boyfriend, its just that he's older than you, so that's what they're objecting to. So how long have you been, how is this your parents been responding this way? 

00:29:20
KENDRA LYONS Well they've only known for a few days, but we've been together longer than that. So if they really knew… 

00:29:30
"How?" often feeling related 

00:29:30
DERYL BAILEY So how does it make you feel that your parents ah don't approve of your boyfriend that you've been dating for a couple of months? 

00:29:35
KENDRA LYONS You know it hurts me because it makes me feel like they can't trust my judgment and they can't understand that I like him for who he really is. And that I feel I'm mature enough to handle somebody that's older than me. 

00:29:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

00:29:50
KENDRA LYONS But they don't look at it that way. 

00:29:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay, so you've got a new boyfriend, who is older than you are, and you think you've got a great relationship and you think you're mature enough to handle that 

00:30:00
KENDRA LYONS Yes. 

00:30:00
DERYL BAILEY that level of relationship. And your parents disprove because they don't think you're quite ready for that type of relationship. 

00:30:05
KENDRA LYONS Or they want me to be with someone my age. 

00:30:10
DERYL BAILEY Can you tell me how that makes you feel? 

00:30:10
KENDRA LYONS I don't like anyone my age. They're all too immature. 

00:30:15
Search for concreteness 

00:30:15
DERYL BAILEY Too immature? Can you give me an example of what that means for them to be too immature? 

00:30:25
KENDRA LYONS The guy I'm with right now I can have conversations with him and they actually mean something to me. The guys at school, the people that are in my grade, you know they're still using like whoopee cushions, that kind of thing. Like that's not… like I'm beyond that you know. And just they, they always knew and my parents always knew that I would be with someone else older than me, but now that I've actually found someone, its like they're going against what they always said. 

00:30:45
Closed question 

00:30:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay ah… Have you had an opportunity to really sit down and talk with your parents about how you feel? 

00:30:55
KENDRA LYONS No not really because I didn't exactly tell them. It was more we've been together for a little while and then they found out that I was at his house instead of me sitting down and talking to them about it, so… We haven't had a chance. 

00:31:10
DERYL BAILEY So can you tell me how you would have preferred them find out? 

00:31:15
KENDRA LYONS I should have told them. 

00:31:15
DERYL BAILEY And how might you how would you have done that? Let's pretend that I'm your… I'm your father. So tell me how you would have… how you would have sort of broken the news to me. 

00:31:25
KENDRA LYONS I would have asked them to trust me, I would have said can you please understand that its more about a connection between me and… and this person rather than going out with him because he's older. It's not about that at all. It's just about when you find someone that you have a strong connection with… there's nothing I can't help it, I can't help the way I feel about him and I want you to understand and respect and trust me enough to at least give him a chance. At least let me go out with him once or twice and you can meet him and see if you like him. You know. 

00:31:55
Search for concreteness 

00:32:00
DERYL BAILEY Can you… can you give me an example of a time when you, you ah… you showed your parents that you were mature, ah… that you are not just their little girl anymore? Can you give me an example of when you… when the time when that was that was so? 

00:32:15
KENDRA LYONS I mean since I was like 14 I've had a job, I've been working on my own. I've been pretty much financially like independent. Ah… I haven't I've made a lot of smart decisions in my life. I've made some mistakes, everyone does. But I've learned from them. 

00:32:30
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:32:30
KENDRA LYONS And now like I'm… I'm balancing so many things in my life. I'm doing well in school, I've been making good decisions lately, I'm still working a lot, and I'm doing things that make them very proud. And I know because they've always told me how responsible and how mature they think that I am. So now this is just another obstacle and I think that you know its not something they should frown upon. 

00:32:50
Search for parents' perspective 

00:32:50
DERYL BAILEY Right. So it sounds like you there's been several opportunities where you've shown your parents that you are mature, you can be trusted. You are responsible, but yet they still are a little hesitant to have you date this older person. How do you think it makes your parents feel to have you their baby girl involved with a older guy? 

00:33:15
KENDRA LYONS Hmm. I guess I never really thought about it from their point of view. 

00:33:20
DERYL BAILEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:33:20
KENDRA LYONS I mean I know they're probably scared and they're probably worried, they don't know what his intentions are. They don't know him. And I guess they're not going to unless… see unless they give him a chance… unless they get to know him. You know… 

00:33:30
DERYL BAILEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:33:30
KENDRA LYONS Because not everyone that's older is the same and they don't all want the same thing from somebody my age and they don't… they're just not going to understand. 

00:33:40
"What?" leads to facts 

00:33:40
DERYL BAILEY Hmm…hmm. So what do you think it is that they're afraid of? 

00:33:45
KENDRA LYONS Me getting hurt. Me getting involved with someone and not focusing on the things that I'm supposed to be focusing on. But I mean I haven't been with someone in a while and I don't know I think that it's fair. I mean its my senior year, you know, so I think its fair to at least give it a chance and understand that I am ready to be in a relationship and I want to be. 

00:34:05
"Why?" seeks out reasons 

00:34:05
DERYL BAILEY Well Kendra it really does sound like that you… there have been times when you've shown your parents that you can be responsible, that you can be trusted, and yet they're still finding it a little hard to let go, and ah… what… what do you think that's about? Why do you think its so hard for them to sort of let go? 

00:34:25
KENDRA LYONS You know I think letting go is actually a really big part of it. I only have… I have one older brother and that's it, so I'm the baby for both of them technically. And I think I grew up really fast, kind of right in front of their eyes and I don't think they expected me to grow up as fast as I did and I know all parents probably have a hard time with that, but I'm leaving at the end of the year, I don't think they're ready to see that at all. And I don't know maybe part of it is they don't want to maybe lose me to someone else. Lose me to a guy before… you know I'm going to leave them anyways and they want to spend as much time with me as they can. 

00:35:00
DERYL BAILEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:35:00
Gender differences 

00:35:05
DERYL BAILEY Do you think this is they… have they responded differently to your brother when he wanted to date people a little bit older? 

00:35:10
KENDRA LYONS Yes. He did. My dad definitely did, my mom did, I think it was more of my brother didn't start… I guess he didn't start going out as much and doing things socially until he was older. And when I started and he was probably older than I am right now. I'm almost 18 and he was probably older than I was before he started going out and doing things. So it was a little harder for them to let go of me, one because I'm their youngest child and two because I was younger than he was when he started doing this. 

00:35:40
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Well let's… let's think about this. You're their youngest child. Do you think you're your being their daughter opposed to their son has anything to do with how they're responding right now? 

00:35:55
KENDRA LYONS A little bit, But that's I mean that's something that I feel strongly on anyways. I feel like I look at my girlfriends and I look at my guy friends and I see how parents treat… it seems to me at least that parents treat males a lot differently than they do girls in some situations in terms of you know sleeping out or like making sure to call and check in. I feel like there's a lot more protection on younger females than there is on males. 

00:36:15
DERYL BAILEY Okay so that sounds like you at least acknowledging the fact that you think your parents are… that it is about protection. 

00:36:20
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. I never really agreed with that whole thing. But I think part of it is about protection. 

00:36:25
"Tell me" works as question 

00:36:30
DERYL BAILEY So how… tell me how you feel about their… their being more protective of you than more so than your brother? 

00:36:35
KENDRA LYONS I can understand I guess. I mean my… my brain is not developed to the point of theirs, so obviously when I'm a parent I'm probably going to understand it more. But right now it seems unfair. And I can't see it from their perspective. So obviously it's gonna… its gonna affect my life right now in a negative way. But maybe when I'm their age and I have kids it's going to make more sense. 

00:36:55
More concreteness 

00:37:00
DERYL BAILEY Okay… okay. Well… well lets talk a little bit about this is obviously not the first time that you have had you and your parents have disagreed right? Okay, so how did you handle those situations? Just give me one example of when there was a time when your parents didn't agree on something. 

00:37:20
KENDRA LYONS Okay. Me being home by 12:00 o'clock, that's a big one... 

00:37:20
DERYL BAILEY Oh yeah. 

00:37:20
KENDRA LYONS Yeah I mean it doesn't make sense because biologically teenagers it's easier for them to stay up later and be out all night and harder to wake up in the morning. But they have a big thing about I have to be home at 12:00 o'clock because of this reason and that reason and I never understood it. I was always upset about it. It never made sense to me. And then we compromised in a way that I could stay out if they knew that I wasn't like driving after that hour. Because legally I'm not supposed to be until I'm over 18. So I promised not to be driving after 12:00 o'clock, but I could be out and I could go somewhere between 12 and 1 say with another friend that was old enough to be driving then. So things like that. That's pretty much how we dealt with it, we've always done like a compromise and they've actually been really good about it. 

00:38:05
DERYL BAILEY So so it sounds like you've been able to compromise with your parents so you can get some of what you want, but yet give them some of what they want… 

00:38:10
KENDRA LYONS Yes. 

00:38:10
DERYL BAILEY …and everybody will be okay. So how might that work in this situation? Where would you see the compromise taking place, at least your, your role in the compromise? 

00:38:20
KENDRA LYONS It's hard to tell right now. But you know I think honestly if I had approached them better about it, if they didn't find out the way they did 

00:38:30
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:38:30
KENDRA LYONS If I hadn't been deceiving I guess, you know if I just told them straight up, you know I like this person and like I can't help it and I want you know how you feel about him… and then you can meet him. We can talk about it rather than thinking they were going to say no right away and then doing it behind their back and then having then find out in the wrong way. So if I guess… if I take responsibility for that now, its never too late, so if I apologize for that and then ask them you know if I can kind of start over with it and bring him to my house and ask them of they can meet him. 

00:39:00
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:39:00
KENDRA LYONS And see if they'll actually give it a chance. 

00:39:05
Summary of brief session 

00:39:05
DERYL BAILEY Okay so in the past you've done some things for example to compromise, being willing to see their side… 

00:39:10
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. 

00:39:10
DERYL BAILEY …as well as getting them to see your side. And you mentioned earlier that you were responsible, you're trustworthy, so those are some positive you know things on your side. So maybe if you consider using the things that you do well in… sort of relating to your parents and sort of reaching those compromises, it might be helpful in this situation. So what I'd like you to do is just sort of you know look back at those experiences and kind of figure out what you did then that made those compromises possible. And how might though sort of… how might you used it sort of solve this situation. Ah… so well let's consider talking about that dumb. You think about those things and the next time we meet we'll talk about what that… what that might look like. Okay. 

00:39:55
KENDRA LYONS Talk to them. 

00:39:55
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

00:40:00
Feedback on Session 

00:40:05
DERYL BAILEY Okay Kendra so lets if we just reflect on what we just did just now. Ah… when we first started I used a lot of closed questions you know… just whether it required short answers. But how… how was that for you? 

00:40:15
KENDRA LYONS I mean when you asked me those questions they were very like, like you said, close and they were very direct and all I could answer yes or no, or give you a number or something like that and it was kind of harder for me to say what I really wanted to and even when even when ah… even if I was thinking something else I stopped thinking about right when you asked that question. So it was harder for me to really tap into what I was feeling in terms of just answering what you were asking. That's all I was really thinking about at the moment. 

00:40:45
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Now on the other hand, the last part of that interview, where I asked more of the other type questions, open-ended questions, what was that like? 

00:40:55
KENDRA LYONS That was a lot easier for me. And in terms of getting my feelings out at least… that was a lot easier for me. And when you asked you asked the open-ended question ah… I could not only answer what you were asking me, but it also made me think more and it took me deeper into that thought. So I had five other things that I wanted to say right after that and I was just able to let them all go at once, just by you asking one question. 

00:41:20
DERYL BAILEY Okay, good. 

00:41:20
KENDRA LYONS So it's helpful. 

00:41:20
DERYL BAILEY All right.

Multicultural Comments 

00:41:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Azara and Deryl on questions in multicultural issues there are lots of them, but one that I really had a powerful learning experience was working in Australia with Matt Rigney, an aboriginal social worker. And I was asking Matt some questions about his job and what he's doing, but we'd been knowing each other for several weeks and he'd developed a trust and he stopped me, Allen could you stop for a minute I want to tell you something about White fellas. You guys are always asking endless questions. And by the time and now I know what happens when you ask me a question, and I'm thinking about, well by the time I've got an answer ready you're off to the next question. What I'd really rather do is chew about it greater length. And sometimes I feel your questions are a little intrusive. Ah… so questions, particularly when you're culturally different cap for potential issues. What are some of your thoughts on the questions in the interview? 

00:42:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Wow. Well that's… I have to agree with… with… ah with your colleagues statement about that, that especially issues regarding family. Allen, they can be perceived as being intrusive. 

00:42:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:42:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It is… ah… you know there is protection of the family to an extent that… that ah… you know you ask about somebody's health and the immediate reaction might be and why do you want to know that? So I think that depending on, you know once again it's situation specific. But for certain things I would see how questions can be perceived as intrusive. 

00:43:05
ALLEN E. IVEY That's quite right there's a point where you've got to use questions carefully. 

00:43:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah right. 

00:43:10
DERYL BAILEY And I think it depends, it goes back to that level of trust. Ah… if… if there's been a relationship developed, and the different, I mean a deeper type of question can be asked. It wouldn't seem as invasive, whereas at the beginning of the interview, ah… you go right to those type of questions. I'm going to be a little you know bit kind of defensive and protective ah… and not willing to sort of give you the type of answer that you're probably going to need.

Paraphrasing and Encouraging Azara Santiago-Rivera and Deryl Bailey Introduction Norma Packard Gluckstern 

00:43:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Attending behavior and questioning are essential whenever you're talking to a client, whether it's to talk about their problem or whether its for them to talk about themselves. But it's also essential that the client know they are being listened to. A simply encourager like uh… uh… or nodding your head is enough to get them the client to continue talking. Paraphrasing, on the other hand, allows them to perhaps understand better what they've been said… saying and clarify both for you and the client. In the first demonstration that you're going to see this afternoon, is ah… the distortion of using paraphrasing and ah… minimal encouragers. In the second one you're going to see how useful these two skills were in encouraging your client to continue talking about their problem.

00:45:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hi Deryl 

00:45:00
DERYL BAILEY Hi. 

00:45:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Welcome. 

00:45:00
DERYL BAILEY Thank you. 

00:45:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So what brings you here today? 

00:45:05
DERYL BAILEY Well I'm just having a challenge, a little struggle. I'm currently in a master's program and… 

00:45:10
Fails to let Deryl finish 

00:45:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Where is the master's program? 

00:45:15
DERYL BAILEY Ah… it's at the university and I'm not really happy with how things are going. I don't feel ah… welcomed, I don't feel ah… I don't feel a part of the department or the cohort. 

00:45:25
"Why?" question may lead to defensiveness 

00:45:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, but why… why not? 

00:45:30
DERYL BAILEY Well there's had been a number of things that sort of have happened over the last semester, that's why… that's why I'm here, is to sort of talk to some of those things and make sure that its not me. Ah… and… and because nobody else seems to think the real problems. 

00:45:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well what makes you think that it's not you? 

00:45:45
DERYL BAILEY Well because they're… they're just different things that just sort of keep happening all the time. And it can't be me, it just can't be me all alone. 

00:45:55
Distortion of Deryl's intent 

00:45:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It takes it takes… it takes you know it takes ah it takes not only… you know you contribute to a problem too, so its you know goes both ways. 

00:46:05
DERYL BAILEY Well and I understand that, but… for example, can I just give you an example? 

00:46:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Sure. 

00:46:10
DERYL BAILEY If I'm in class and first of all I'm the only African American in the class by the way, and you know there's a question asked of the class and I raise my hand. And I'm totally ignored. I'm sitting in the very front row of the entire class… and there are people all around me being called on except for me. 

00:46:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Who ignores you? 

00:46:30
DERYL BAILEY Well the teacher teaching the class. Now, I understand that its some graduate assistant, but still I'm standing… I'm sitting right there in front of you… and you know when I came into this program I came with a set of experiences. And so when you asked a question about a particular topic and I have some experience or some an opinion at least, allow me to have an opinion, but when I'm just totally ignored and everybody else around me who ah… rightfully so have their opinions, but I have mine too and… and but I'm just sort of totally sort of not even included in the class discussions. 

00:47:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You sound pretty upset. Well maybe we should just start from the beginning. 

00:47:10
DERYL BAILEY Well that kind of is the beginning, you know it… it… it it started happening from the time I got into the program. It's like ah… I realize I'm the first African-American to be accepted into this program and but we don't be beyond that. You know, treat me like you do any other student or treat me like you do… The students should treat me like they treat their other peers. 

00:47:35
"Why?" questions may lead to defensiveness 

00:47:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And why do you think you should be treated like everybody else? 

00:47:35
Deryl defines issues despite the counselor 

00:47:35
DERYL BAILEY Because I am like everybody else. I've… I've… I've… I've you know I've met all the criteria to get into the program. I've worked hard since I've been here; ah… you know I have… all my assignments are turning in on time. I try to be a good citizen and participate in the out-of-class activities that the groups do. But by the way they don't even sometimes let me know that these things are going on. I just sort of overhear about them and so I decide to show up because I want to feel a part of the cohort. I mean it's a cohort you know we're supposed to be in this together. Ah… the students don't make me feel included… and the faculty definitely don't even to anything about and trying to help me feel included. 

00:48:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well it's a complicated problem it sounds like, we're just going to have to sort it out. 

00:48:20
DERYL BAILEY Well I hoped so ah… because I don't know if I want to continue in this program if it's going to continue to be this way. I've got three more years here and this is… it's not a good feeling. You know I go from being angry to be feeling hurt… to just like feeling downright you know not a part of things. So I don't know. 

00:48:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA We'll work on it. 

00:48:50

Paraphrasing: Positive Example 

00:49:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hi Deryl my name is Azara. Welcome. 

00:49:00
DERYL BAILEY Hi, nice to meet you. 

00:49:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Nice to meet you too. 

00:49:00
DERYL BAILEY Same here. 

00:49:00
Introductory sharing 

00:49:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah… before we get started I'd like to ah… I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself because I know that you are this is your first time coming to the counseling center. 

00:49:10
DERYL BAILEY Yes. 

00:49:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I just wanted to let you know that I've been working with the counseling center now for ten years and have worked with a variety of students. And ah… it's been ah it's been… I've had the good fortune of ah… of working with a very diverse student population, so I'm very ah… very happy about that. 

00:49:30
DERYL BAILEY Good. 

00:49:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And ah… given that I just wondered if ah… if you had any concerns about… about our difference. You know that I'm a female, I'm Latino and you're an African-American male and wondered how… what your level of comfort was with that? 

00:49:45
DERYL BAILEY Well actually now that you mentioned it I… I do feel some relief, and not that you're going to understand my total experience, but my guess is that we'll have some things in common. And ah… I don't know I'm just a bit more open to the experience being that this is my first time and not knowing what to expect except for what I've heard about you know the counseling process and ah… so first of all I'm really surprised that you are you know also ah… different. 

00:50:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay, well you know as we talk a little bit about, about your concerns if there's something that's not right, please by all means just you know let me know. 

00:50:25
DERYL BAILEY Okay, I will. Thank you. 

00:50:25
Open Question 

00:50:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay that will help this discussion today, yeah, great. So ah… tell me what ah… what brings you to the counseling center? 

00:50:30
DERYL BAILEY Well I'm in my second semester of the master's program, and it's not been smooth sailing. I'm not very happy with the experience. It's not what I expected. Ah… you know I'm the first one in my family first of all to to be in a graduate program, so ah… my family couldn't sort of help prepare me for what to expect. I knew the work was going to be rigorous, but it's not even the work, it's the other pieces of the experience that have been less than fulfilling. I don't feel connected to anybody in the program. I don't feel connected or like there's a relationship with the faculty. I just sort of feel like that I'm an outsider. I'm the only African-American in the department and while that's an obvious kind of ah… difference, but it feels much larger than that. I feel like I'm not included in things. 

00:51:25
Reflection of feeling 

00:51:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So you're feeling right now that you're sort of alone? 

00:51:30
DERYL BAILEY Yes, absolutely. I mean there have been so many different incidents that sort of… sometimes I was wondering you know is it just me. Am I imaging all this? Am I… 

00:51:40
Encourage 

00:51:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Is it just you? Yeah. 

00:51:40
DERYL BAILEY That's kind of you know how I was feeling sometimes. And am I making this stuff up? Am I being over sensitive? But things just keep reoccurring. They keep happening, so it can't be me. And if it is then maybe there's something that I need to do differently. But I just don't… I just don't think it's just me. 

00:52:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It's not just you. Yeah. So tell me a little bit more about how you're sensing all of this. What's your feeling about this whole thing? 

00:52:10
DERYL BAILEY Well it's like when I walk in class, I can… it feels like that everybody is watching everything I do. If I were to you know sit in the wrong seat or ah… ah drop a pencil or something's like all the attention is on me. And it's not the type of healthy attention, its like they're looking for me to do something wrong. Waiting for me to ah… to fail. 

00:52:35
Paraphrase 

00:52:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So they're waiting for you to do something wrong. 

00:52:40
Open Question 

00:52:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA What might that be? 

00:52:40
DERYL BAILEY I don't know. Ah… it's it almost… almost like everybody is uncomfortable with my being in the room. That's more what it is. The students are uncomfortable when we have to do group projects, ah… they'll have meetings and… and… and won't tell me about them. Or even when they have social gatherings, I'm the last one to know. And then when I show up they'll be in conversation and the minute I walk up the conversation stops. And ah… you know it's… it's… it's like what is this? You know. 

00:53:10
Encourage 

00:53:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Entered up there conversation stops. 

00:53:10
DERYL BAILEY Yes… yes it's almost like ah… no I don't want to sound paranoid but they were either talking about me or making plans that they didn't want to include me on. Ah… ah… there had been one incident in class where you know I even just totally overlooked. I don't, I have no voice in class. I'm never encouraged to be part of the discussion. Ah… and if I do manage to get a word in edgewise its… its like its okay he said something, lets move on to the next student. So it just doesn't feel good. There are days when I just… I feel emotionally drained just after being in a three hour class, because it's a constant fight to be included. And ah… at times when I am included it's like… it's its… its a big issue. They make too much of deal out of it. 

00:54:00
Encourage 

00:54:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Big issue, yeah. 

00:54:00
DERYL BAILEY Yeah. I want to be treated and feel just like every other student in the program. And I don't feel that. And ah… I'm not sure I want to stay in this environment. Its not healthy, just doesn't feel healthy. 

00:54:10
Paraphrase 

00:54:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You don't think it's real healthy for you right now. No. 

00:54:15
DERYL BAILEY No. 

00:54:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:54:20
Paraphrasing Feedback 

00:54:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well Deryl I was wondering how ah… how that second session went for you? 

00:54:25
DERYL BAILEY Felt good, it felt really good. Ah… I felt like I was getting my story told, which is part of the problem with that scenario was that I had nobody to talk to in my environment. But coming to this counseling session allowed me to sort of vent and sort of say what I needed to say. 

00:54:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. Now do you think that the way I sort of paraphrased some of the things ah… was really sort of helping you to explore and say more about your situation? 

00:54:55
DERYL BAILEY I… I truly believe so. It sort of helped… it helped me organize what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. Ah… so that was really helpful. 

00:55:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know I was wondering if you could just share with us a little bit about that experience, about being the only African-American in the program. I think that's important for… for us to… to really… to really make… make known because of… because of the ah… you know a few minorities that are in these graduate programs. So what are your thoughts on that? 

00:55:30
DERYL BAILEY Well its definitely not a new experience. Ah… all through high school and under grade that was pretty much the situation. But its something that you never really get used to because its thinking that you know, by this time you know in a master's program, things would have changed somewhat. But it still is kind of you feel isolated and it's kind of odd. Because on one hand you want people to really reach out and sort of help make you feel comfortable, but at the same time you don't want to seem like somebody's community service project. 

00:56:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right, sure. 

00:56:00
DERYL BAILEY You know where its… its the attention is artificial. Ah… so what would really be helpful is just to have people just be themselves, be real. And ah… its just unfortunate people found a or have a hard time being that way. I think they have to be something different or special to be inclusive, when in essence you don't. Ah… I would really just appreciate being included and just like everybody else. Ah… but it's not something… its something I haven't gotten used to yet and it's been my lifelong experience. Ah… but I don't know. 

00:56:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. That's an important issue. I think it's many of us experience that in different settings. So thank you for sharing that with us. 

00:56:40
DERYL BAILEY Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to. 

00:56:45

00:56:50
Multicultural Feedback 

00:56:55
ALLEN E. IVEY The next thing we'd like to talk about is ah… the use of paraphrasing encouragers. I think we've agreed in our preliminary discussion that paraphrasing and saying back accurately what is heard seems to fit for us. We think generally across cultures. Unless you've got somebody… there's an occasional client you'll get to say "I just said that." But that has always can happen with, but generally speaking we feel pretty comfortable with it. The issue of encouragers I think does vary. The issue of head nodding and the use of silence Azara, what occurs to you? 

00:57:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA The issue of silence really kind of resonates, because ah… ah… you know from my background as a Latino Puerto Rican, ah… you know where we talk with our hands a lot, we were expressive, we sit around a dinner table and everybody is talking at once. 

00:57:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:57:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Silence is interpreted as agreeing with somebody. 

00:57:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

00:57:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA When you're silent that means you agree, you're agreeing with a comment or a statement said by a person of authority. That's what silence means. So silence is… is… is we kind of have to redefine that when you're working with… at least with Puerto Ricans or something else. 

00:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I was working up in the central Artic one time with native Inuit populations and silence is really a way of being. And you know many native Americans it is quite cool, quite acceptable to sit and not say anything for a while. What about silence? 

00:58:20
DERYL BAILEY I think that's a tricky one because I think too much silence says that you're not listening, that you're not hearing me. I can remember several African-American students that I've worked with and for them to start get to start telling a story and they're not if you don't nod or say hmm…hmm… or something, it seems it feels like they're not being heard and they'll often say you understand what I'm saying, do you know what I mean? So making the verbal, the head nod with a little verbal hmm…hmm… ah… periodically is helpful. 

00:58:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I also understand that among some Asian population, Chinese in particular that I'm kind of what we call a head bobber. And that is seen really as very discomforting and really and not with particularly traditional, some traditional agents highly inappropriate. So again we never really know if the cultures do vary in their use of body language. And we always have to be aware of that. But people do like to be encouraged and people are there to talk. 

00:59:20
DERYL BAILEY Yes. 

00:59:25
End Paraphrasing and Encouraging Reflection of Feeling Stimulus Vignettes 

00:59:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Understanding feelings is ah… really basic to the counseling and interviewing process. We've set up a series of vignettes which we'd like you to look at and then identify the feeling. First you're going to see a series of potential client's present single dimensions of emotions. Your task is to identify their emotion. Then we're going to stop the tape and ask you to one identify the emotion, two write or say an actual reflection of feeling. You feel sad, glad, mad, whatever, because… and you state the reason. This is the classic reflection of feeling. Ah… in one ways it look artificial, but this practice will really help you get more in the grove with identifying and being comfortable with dealing with feelings. After that we're going to take a look at mixed feelings and we'll wind up a little bit in terms of incongruous non-verbal messages which modify how a person feelings. So watch the tape, stop it, identify the feeling, write down your reflection of feeling and here we go. 

01:00:40
You will see brief client statements. Identify the emotion(s). Develop a reflection of feeling. Deryl talks about his wife. 

01:00:45
DERYL BAILEY My wife is the most incredible person that I've ever met. She's compassionate, she's smart, she's good looking, she's ah… patient with me when she needs to be and at the same time she can be firm when she needs to be. But she's encouraging. She's… she's wonderful.

Kendra learns of friend's death 

01:02:20
KENDRA LYONS I was sitting in my social studies class and my teacher looked down at the morning announcements and asked if anyone in the class knew him. I was the only one that raised my hand. I said we had been friends for years. He looked back down at the paper and then at the whole class and announced to everyone that he had died in a car accident the night before. Every set of eyes turned and stared at me for the remaining two minutes of the class. I held my tears in until the bell rang and I was outside in the hallway.

KENDRA LYONS I lost one of my good friends in a car accident. After the initial feelings of grief and shock I moved toward the reality that I was never going to see him again. Almost a year later, I'm still having feelings of sadness and grief and it's hard to go about the things that I usually do best. I hope by talking about this and letting go a little bit I can get to a place where I can go about daily activities and be fine again.

I don't know if I'm ready to leave. I don't know if I'm ready to leave the ones that I love and be on my own.

But on the other hand just always wanting to… to get this degree and the things it'll allow me to do ah… I want to… I want to complete it, I want to see it to the end, but I'm just not sure.

01:05:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I have to tell you that I'm really angry… angry at my father. I lost my mother about 6 months ago and I just found out that he wants to remarry. Now I want him to be happy and I certainly don't want him to spend the rest of his life alone, but I'm mad at him for doing this so quickly. It's just too early.

STOP THE VIDEO Name feeling(s): Azara, the remarriage leads you to mainly to feel ____, but you also feel ____." Allen and nonverbal feelings 

01:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And, as we wind up this section on vignettes of feeling, we also ought to remember there's also non-verbal communication, which often can override and be more important than the words. 

01:06:10
Note hand movements 

01:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY For example "Hey you're really a nice guy. Obviously the hand is where the message is. What is the feeling in the hand? Or "I really feel very comfortable talking with you." A nose wipe often is a sign that the client or the other person is uncomfortable. Ah… they can be part of the thing… everything is fine, or maybe its not so fine. 

01:06:40
Note vocal tone 

01:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Another thing is the a length pick. Yeah, I really liked working with you as a counselor, you're great. Ah… the non-verbal message often says far more than the verbal message. So be aware of what's going on. I'm not nervous as I'm twiddling my thumbs. Watch the body as well as the words. We hope these vignettes have been somewhat helpful to you.

01:07:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Kendra. 

01:07:25
KENDRA LYONS Hi. 

01:07:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi. Well I understand you have some things to talk about that you have… ah… you know about the death of your friend. We talked about last year, but I think you still have some more things you wanted to talk to me about. I saw you in the hall, I thought maybe you'd like to share some more. 

01:07:55
KENDRA LYONS Hmm…hmm. The thing is that I do think about it every day. And obviously I probably will for the rest of my life. But at this point, I mean it's the end of last year, so at this point I feel like I should be able to function normally and go about my day and do things that I could do fine before it happened. And you know I'm still having a hard time. 

01:08:15
Reflection of feeling 

01:08:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're feeling like you know I suppose, are you feeling sadness, still this overriding sadness that you had last year. And… and ah… grief probably, still in the grief process. 

01:08:30
KENDRA LYONS Definitely still grieving. At first there was such a huge like shock… 

01:08:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:08:35
KENDRA LYONS …to me that it didn't… like I said to you last year, like I didn't seem real for so long and then I got over that a little more when I understood what was actually going on. But I don't even I think it's been long enough for me to understand that I'm not ever going to see him again. So that's still… and the thing is that there were so many people that were close with him and everything… 

01:09:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

01:09:00
KENDRA LYONS …and I wonder… I feel like… I know I'm probably not, but I feel like I'm the only one that's having a hard time doing things that I used to be able to do. 

01:09:05
Reflection of feeling 

01:09:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You're feeling like you're alone in this. Even though he knew lots of other people, you feel like you're… 

01:09:10
KENDRA LYONS There is no one talks about him anymore and I feel like I could talk about it to these people everyday. 

01:09:15
Reflection of feeling 

01:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And you have just still a lot of feeling inside you and need to express that feeling to say how you're feeling about him and what happened. 

01:09:25
Positive support 

01:09:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And so I think its good to tell your story and to… to… to experience that grief. I mean if its there we need to talk about it. If no one else talks about it and you still feel like you need to talk about it, that's what we're here for, to have you talk about it. And to experience that. 

01:09:40
KENDRA LYONS At the same time it seems really hard. I mean even like with you, like sitting here it's really hard to talk about it. But I think about it so much that I need an outlet for it because I cant just… 

01:09:50
Paraphrase 

01:09:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Can't just think about it and have it… 

01:09:55
KENDRA LYONS Right. 

01:09:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …rattling around in your head, you want to be able to express it and say your feelings. 

01:09:55
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. 

01:09:55
Open question - "can?" 

01:10:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What… can you tell me more about the situation and how it happened? And your closeness, I mean relationship with him. 

01:10:05
KENDRA LYONS I grew up with him. 

01:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm…hmm. So you felt almost like a life-long friend really. 

01:10:10
KENDRA LYONS Family, our families were really close. 

01:10:10
Reflecting of feeling 

01:10:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you had that closeness, that feeling of closeness. 

01:10:15
KENDRA LYONS We were building our house like we lived… I basically lived with his family and then… 

01:10:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're really like family then, you know that close. 

01:10:20
KENDRA LYONS And then we separated for a little while, because he was a couple of years older than me, so he went to like junior high before I did and everything. 

01:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:10:30
KENDRA LYONS And we lost touch for a year or so until I came. 

01:10:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

01:10:35
KENDRA LYONS And then we started hanging out a lot more and just like rekindled our friendship basically. And I started being friends with his friends, you know and everything. 

01:10:40
Paraphrase/reflect feeling 

01:10:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I know you're friends with his friends and so you're all… you're really part of the whole group there. And he was very special to you. You had a feeling of… of tremendous loss I'm sure. 

01:10:55
KENDRA LYONS Then the other thing that I can't really get over is like since it was a car accident and he wasn't driving, its like I'm angry about that. And I know that I shouldn't be… but I'm angry at the person that was driving. 

01:11:05
Interpretation of feelings 

01:11:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And that's… that's all right to be angry because that's one of the things that happens along the way when someone dies everywhere. We feel all kinds of feelings and all of those feelings are okay, and anger is really very normal. Normal to feel angry and you know that he's in a situation where he's not even driving, because he's maybe using more careful driver and he's the one that… 

01:11:25
KENDRA LYONS And it wasn't, you know sometimes I don't feel like it was his fault. And the way I found out too. 

01:11:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:11:35
KENDRA LYONS It wasn't fair, because they told… they told us in the middle of class. As you know last year they read… they read the announcement and they asked if anyone knew him before they told and I raised my hand and I said obviously that I was friends with him and then… then my teacher told the whole class, right… right after that. So every face turned and looked at me. So it was just like it was a horrible way to find out. And then I was in the middle of school, and then the only person I talked to about it afterwards was like his best friend. And I can't even be around him anymore talk about it, because its too intense for me, because he's too… he's so much more like hurt about it than I'm even. 

01:12:15
Reflection of feeling 

01:12:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're both feeling hurt. 

01:12:15
KENDRA LYONS But, I can't even be around him… because it's too depressing for me, because I'm trying to… 

01:12:20
Summary, feeling focus 

01:12:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Work it through. So being around his friend probably reminds you of him and… 

01:12:25
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. 

01:12:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …and the way it was told, and the feeling. You know being, you know this is not fair. And here you are, you know him so well and everybody is looking at you. And is evident you really have a chance to give your… to really grieve to be out there, and just feel ah… you know the tremendous sadness and loss and ah… you know for someone that's been part of your family practically. And you've been part of their family. 

01:12:50
KENDRA LYONS I know. Like everyone says, when they lose someone like they never got to say good bye… 

01:12:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:13:00
KENDRA LYONS …or like say last thing they wanted, but it was like… it was like the last time I saw him, which was like the day before, I was just like such… like a casual, like it was just such a casual interaction. What if like a… a hug and like hi how are you doing and it was like my friend's birthday that day, so it was more of like I'll see you later thing then. 

01:13:15
Paraphrase/reflect feeling 

01:13:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So here at the very last session, very last moments with him or just very casual and… and that really expressing how you really feel about it and that you didn't have a chance to say good bye. 

01:13:25
KENDRA LYONS Exactly. 

01:13:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And say how important he was to your life. 

01:13:30
KENDRA LYONS I don't even think I did… I told you we like started being friends again… 

01:13:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:13:35
KENDRA LYONS Ah… after we weren't for a little while and I don't even think I really did since we started being friends again. Expressed that. 

01:13:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you feel… 

01:13:45
KENDRA LYONS Like it's been years since… 

01:13:45
Paraphrase 

01:13:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Years since you have been able to… you wish that you had almost said how much… how important you really were to me. 

01:13:50
Closed question 

01:13:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Have you ever had a chance to write letters and to sort of express some of your feelings that ways? 

01:13:55
KENDRA LYONS I haven't done that. 

01:13:55
Suggestion/Summary 

01:13:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That sometimes is a good way… it's good to talk about it to, and write about it and get it out that way. And… and ah… sometimes talking to other kids, I mean like you said that's hard though, its you know but it certainly is very normal. What you're going through is the grief process and it's you know the feeling of loss and everybody. You know we feel sadness, we feel anger, all these mixed feelings and certainly… certainly a sense of part of us is gone you know with this person. And you know, and it's almost like wishful thinking, if only I could that last session, you know that last moment with him-tell him how important he was to me. You always wish, that you know that's the magical thinking stage you go through and you wish that could happen. But you know ah… it's… it's just hard to you know continue to live with all that. 

01:14:45
Several minutes deleted, Interview continues 

01:14:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Kendra we've been talking quite a bit right now and you know about all these feelings. I'm just wondering how you're feeling right now as we've been discussing this and reflecting some of your feelings and so forth. How are you feeling now? 

01:15:05
KENDRA LYONS As hard as it is to like actually like verbalize… 

01:15:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:15:10
KENDRA LYONS …again, like what happened. 

01:15:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:15:10
KENDRA LYONS It's like helping. Because actually its to let to let it out obviously. 

01:15:15
Open questions 

01:15:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What other things do you need to let out? What other feelings need to be let out? What do you need to say about it? What needs to come out? 

01:15:25
KENDRA LYONS Basically the thing I said about the kid who was driving, which was one of his friends and he wasn't even like allowed at the funeral or anything. Because he was definitely driving recklessly and everything so that I have a lot of anger about that, because in a lot of ways… I mean his life is probably ruined right now, so in some ways I just want to like give him a hug and just like talk to him about it and like make sure that he's going to be okay. And then in other ways I'm blaming him for it and I don't really want to do that, but I cant help it because there's no other… 

01:16:00
Summary 

01:16:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It just feels like. I can hear what you're saying. I mean you've got him and you are angry at him for what he did. And at the same time thinking, you know for the rest of his life he has to live with the fact that he killed his friend. I mean I'm sure they were friends and they were good friends and he has to live with that, so he's suffering too in some ways. So it is a question of you know can we be helpful to him in some way? I guess that's your call, if you feel like you can reach out and comfort him in some way or comfort each other. 

01:16:30
KENDRA LYONS I don't even know where he is now, so… 

01:16:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah… yeah. Hmm…hmm… 

01:16:30
Reflecting possible feelings of driver 

01:16:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Something just to wonder about. But you know that he's probably suffering equally as much from what happened. 

01:16:40
KENDRA LYONS If not more. 

01:16:40
Open question 

01:16:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY If not more. What other feelings do you have that are just sort of sitting there? 

01:16:50
KENDRA LYONS Wishing that there were other people around me that I could talk to about it, in terms of my friends. And I'm wondering why if they don't bring it up because it's just too hard for them to talk about. 

01:16:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

01:17:00
KENDRA LYONS Or because they really don't have anything else to say about it. So I'm kind of feeling a little bit isolated. A little bit… just like I feel alienated from like what's really going on basically. 

01:17:10
Reflection of feeling 

01:17:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're feeling isolated and alienated because none of these kids want to talk about it or you don't think so, ah… so the feeling is you're out there alone. 

01:17:20
KENDRA LYONS I just feel like I'm watching my daily activities and I'm watching what I do, even though I'm doing it. I feel like I'm just watching myself doing it, and I'm not really taking part in it. 

01:17:30
Reflection of feeling 

01:17:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're feeling like you're sort of outside yourself, watching what's going on in the daily activities. And ah… not really able to participate because you're still feeling all these feelings. 

01:17:40
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. 

01:17:40
Closed question/suggestion 

01:17:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And is there… are ah there any friends that you can talk with at all or do they just seem to be totally closed… anybody you can trust I mean? 

01:17:50
KENDRA LYONS The thing is that most of my… my close like girlfriends didn't really know him very well. 

01:17:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I see. 

01:17:55
KENDRA LYONS So if I bring it up with them its just kind of like I feel like they just think here she goes again with it. Basically because you know if you can't really connect on the same level then its not as interesting to you or as important to talk about it. 

01:18:10
Reflection of feeling 

01:18:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So if they're not interested then it makes you feel like well they're not going to care about this or they're not going to be interested in this. So, you're feeling again more isolated and alienated from everything. 

01:18:20
KENDRA LYONS You know the ones that were really close with him, like I said its really hard to be around them, in a different way too, because instead of talking about him helping each other, its more of a depressing thing. It's more of like… 

01:18:30
Paraphrase 

01:18:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So no one talks about it, sort of this elephant in the room that no talks about. And yeah… because it's depressing, so people feel depressed about it. 

01:18:35
KENDRA LYONS Yeah. 

01:18:35
Reflection of feeling 

01:18:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And so you're feeling depressed they're feeling depressed and its… there it is right there. So it really feels… 

01:18:45
KENDRA LYONS That's what I have to do, something like this, if anything. 

01:18:45
Summary 

01:18:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Absolutely, its what you need to do is keep talking about it till you feel like you've worked it through and shared what you need to share, and gotten those feelings out and… and ah… then just moved on, hopefully to another stage at some point, where you would certainly always remember him, but… but in some perspective that's not there every single day. Yeah. Well lets continue our conversations and ah… you certainly can come here and it's a safe place to talk and its okay to talk about him and any kind of feelings that you have we'll certainly share, okay. Thanks so much for coming in Kendra. 

01:19:25
Debriefing 

01:19:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY How was that session for you? I mean lets just talk about how that went? 

01:19:35
KENDRA LYONS Very helpful. 

01:19:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Very Helpful. 

01:19:35
KENDRA LYONS I felt down here earlier and now I'm lifted a little bit. 

01:19:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You're lifted a little bit. What part of it was most helpful to you? What exactly did I do that might have been helpful? 

01:19:45
KENDRA LYONS The questions that you asked about what I was still holding on to were really helpful and important to me, because I didn't really, I could feel everyday, but I didn't really know what I was mainly most upset about. And now I understand that it's you know the feeling of not expressing what I wanted to express to him and the feeling of his friend ah… driving and me not being able to talk to my friends about it. So now I'm like more clear on what my issues are about it still. 

01:20:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What's really bothering you the friends and the ah… you know the feelings you have about this and the way you closed off that issues. So it just became a little bit clearer. 

01:20:20
KENDRA LYONS Yes. 

01:20:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And it elevated yourself this much higher, so that's a little bit better. It's still… it's still hard you know, it will probably be with you for a long time. I mean it's just not easy. I don't know… I don't know if anybody finds it easy; and and I guess ah… continuing to talk about those things and I guess that's the direction. Is there anything else that you'd like to share that was helpful that you found in the session? 

01:20:45
Kendra's feelings have changed 

01:20:45
KENDRA LYONS Ah… my feelings when you asked about like right we aren't taking about right after it happened, when you asked questions about that. Ah… and kind of to compare it to how I feel now in terms of right after it happened and the whole shock stage and everything to now. I realize I have progressed a little bit at least which gives me a little more hope that I will. 

01:21:05
Paraphrase 

01:21:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right you're out of that shock stage and you're reflecting a bit on this, you still have those feelings but you're in a different sort of stage right now. 

01:21:15
KENDRA LYONS And to be able to just talk about that out loud… 

01:21:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:21:15
KENDRA LYONS …with you, it helps me to understand it more. 

01:21:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Of course. 

01:21:25
Multicultural Comments on Reflecting Feeling 

01:21:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Now lets to talk a really complex issue, we obviously can't cover it all and that is the issue of reflection of feeling and expression of emotion, because there's wide cultural variation and how appropriate it is to deal with emotion and feelings. Who'd like to go first this time? 

01:21:45
DERYL BAILEY I'll start. I think again in general with African-American, it's… it's… it's it's a way of being for us to be very expressive and so in that way of being there's a lot of we've done outward showing of emotion. And I think it's… it's critical to sort off ah… you know make sure that we understand… as… as… a counselor understand that we make sure we understand what that emotion is about, that we're reading that emotion or the expression of emotion accurately. 

01:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm... 

01:22:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Once again it's the generalization issue which ah… sometimes ah… helps and doesn't help. But anyway it's the idea that ah… among Latinos it's a very expressive culture. 

01:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

01:22:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah… ah… you know I can think of an example of about ah… when people greet each other. It's a hug, it's a kiss, it's a very out there ah… emotional expression. And I think that ah… there's a there's a positive side to that and a not so positive side and I think once again its important to gage what you're talking about. It's always contextual but yeah I would say that emotion and expression go hand in hand. 

01:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah… we certainly in counseling encourage expression of emotion, but the story from my own cultural background I love to tell to start of illustrate this. I have a wonderful aunt Edna who passed away a few years back. I was visiting her out in the Seattle area and ah… we had dinner together and had a lovely time. The next day I flew back and then I get a telephone call from my mother that aunt Edna had gone in the next day for a cancer operation. And pretty characteristic of my aunt and some members of my family if big issues are going on emotionally and they are not talked about. So there are wide… wide differences. You can't generalize that to all White culture. And each person, each individual will really have a very different way of expressing themselves emotionally. Ah… and ah… Asians, Indonesians will often be more subtle in their expression of emotions. Expression of emotions sometimes in native American culture can be seen as a weakness. So each individual will vary. And ah… and when you mix up the gender and sex of the counselor changes. What about just the gender issue just quickly? 

01:24:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well the dynamics will vary too. You know, ah… there are certainly distinct gender differences in the expression of emotions and ah… you know ah whereas ah… you know men may feel more comfortable withholding, women are more expressive. Add… add a cultural dimension to that and it becomes even more complex. So we have to consider gender as well. 

01:24:25
DERYL BAILEY Right. I think we have also to look at how ah… men and women socialize. You know, women may not socialize that there are certain emotions that you don't show… 

01:24:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm…hmm… 

01:24:35
DERYL BAILEY …ah… because it was seen as a sign of weakness. Whereas women are more apt to show ah… feelings of… of care or nurturing and so forth. So you have to keep in mind that how… how people socialize within their own cultures. 

01:24:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I think we'll all agree with this, do not stereotype. 

01:24:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Absolutely. 

01:24:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Expect people to vary. Within culture, sometimes the variation is more with among ah… the individuals. Individuals will vary even more than the cultures do at times. 

01:25:00
DERYL BAILEY Yeah, this is true. 

01:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY We can't count on it, be aware of it. 

01:25:05
DERYL BAILEY Right.

BASIC ATTENDING SKILLS (4th Edition) Disc 2 of 2 Summary Norma Packard Gluckstern and Mary Bradford Ivey Introduction Deryl Bailey 

01:25:35
DERYL BAILEY Clients talk about a lot of things, and summarizing what they've said really helps to organize their thoughts and feelings. In addition, you as the interviewer get a chance to see if you'd heard the client. If you have a, a client who gives you a longer list of issues, it might be wise to stop from time to time, and summarize what has been said before going on. A summary of the last interview is a good way to begin a new session and at the end of the interview it's usually helpful to summarize what has been said. 

01:26:05
[sil.] 

01:26:05
Summary: Positive Example Summary of previous session 

01:26:10
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Good morning, Mary. Good to see you. 

01:26:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Nice to see you, Norma. 

01:26:15
Summary of previous session 

01:26:15
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Oh, let me just, uhm, we gotta refresh what we talked about last week. 

01:26:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. 

01:26:20
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN I want you to talk to me about how hurricane had affected your mother that was, - 

01:26:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. 

01:26:25
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - that was in the paper for everybody to read, two hurricanes in a row. Ah, what about Cathy finally graduating, can't find a job and that one is in fact, she might lose her health insurance. 

01:26:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:26:35
Summary of previous session 

01:26:35
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And that's a little scary. And Elizabeth who, who's doting the baby but now Elizabeth is saying I've got to go back to work. 

01:26:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:26:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And finally, how you're feeling like how much responsibility can I take? How much more of this can I take? 

01:26:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Absolutely, you've got it, Norma. Oh! And I think the first thing I wanna talk to you today about is not only two hurricanes, there had been four and my dear mother who's elderly had to evacuate her house twice because she lives in a barrier island and that's, that's very hard in elderly people, you know, with health issues and so forth. And she had to go to my sister's house and my sister, you know, they work and she's got her niece there and it lost-- they lost the power for six days, you know, that doesn't bad to us up here but there's no air conditioning. And so, you know, on top of which they have a flood and their whole living room rug. That's the story. The brand new living room rug. They're just fixing up their house, in fact, they just finished the other room and they're so please that the whole rug is destroyed and they're all at their wit's end. I get phone calls from them, everybody is just hurricane worry and they're, they're just exhausted. 

01:27:40
Paraphrase 

01:27:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN So what I hear is this hurricane has been devastating in that way for them but it's been devastating for you because you have to be on the phone constantly. 

01:27:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:27:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN You've had to get advice and, and you're, and you're a long distance from it. 

01:27:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That's right. 

01:27:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN It's a lot more frustrating for you 

01:28:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's, it's very frus-- it's very hard, very difficult and, and my mother going to the hospital on top of it, that was the final blow. It is, you know, because of the lack of, ah, air conditioning her breathing, you know, we got-- became very labored and she has congenital heart, uhm, disease and you know, she end up in the hospital and that would more phone calls. 

01:28:20
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN More phone calls. 

01:28:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But then I couldn't fly down because... 

01:28:20
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN The airports are closed. 

01:28:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Airports are closed. So that was very difficult. 

01:28:25
Summary 

01:28:25
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN It is been a very, very hard months for you. 

01:28:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Very hard. 

01:28:30
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Two hurricanes unusual, ah, your mother having to have back to the hospital and the conflict that you're having with your sister, - 

01:28:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:28:35
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - and on top of it even their house being, you know, just sort of ruin. Then we're off. 

01:28:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's been ruined. It's been dirty. 

01:28:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Oh my god. 

01:28:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then... 

01:28:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Ah! 

01:28:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then... 

01:28:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN There's another one? Oh yes. 

01:28:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then we have Cathy who just graduated and, you know, I don't if I told she did get a, ah, what's I called the paid internship, - 

01:28:55
 Oh no. 

01:28:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - which is kinda like, you know, getting a job except you don't have health insurance. It's sort of, ah, you know, minimal pay kind of thing. It could translate into a job so she, you know, there's always hope there. But meanwhile, you know, she's got roommate problems and she wants to live alone but that's too expensive and, you know, I worry about her in DC, that's not the safest place in the world. 

01:29:15
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:29:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And you know, she's on the phone calling and you know we're trying to encourage her to keep looking for jobs and, you know, maybe trans-- maybe get this job that she translate internship into a real job. So, you know, we're always kind of talking about-- talking to her and trying to be supportive of, of her and her efforts. 

01:29:35
Paraphrase 

01:29:35
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN So Cathy is also there and, ah, you didn't, you didn't tell me that she had get that internship which is really wonderful. 

01:29:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, that's great. 

01:29:40
Reflection of feeling 

01:29:40
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And it's paying enough but not that much. 

01:29:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right, you got it. 

01:29:45
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Sure. And so, what in, in your war now, what she's going to do about health insurance cuz that's your... 

01:29:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No. It isn't a real job. That's not a real job and there's no health insurance, yeah. And so that's gonna expire in, you know. 

01:29:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN So you're a little bit worried that... 

01:29:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And she could barely get along. This is, this is minimal wage, you know. This is not a job. It's a kind of squashy job so I'm worried about that. 

01:30:00
Encourage / Paraphrase 

01:30:00
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And so she is worried about that. And then what, what can you do for her in relate to that? So that, that's another problem that you're carrying. 

01:30:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:30:10
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN All in the same week? 

01:30:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. All-- and then also we have Liz who's got her, you know, this new baby and she has to work and it's, you know, I wanna be a good grandma and I wanna be there and help her but it just feels like I'm, you know, dealing her mother in the phone, I'm dealing with Cathy and I, you know, I wanna be there for her and it's, ah, meanwhile I don't know where I'm at. 

01:30:30
Paraphrase 

01:30:30
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN So here, Elizabeth calling you, - 

01:30:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:30:30
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - having a similar problem, slightly different. This wonderful baby, on the other hand, - 

01:30:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:30:35
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - is bringing a new problem for her and I-- other thing I sense is you being torn in a variety of directions. 

01:30:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes. I feel very torn. I certainly do. And never mind the fact that we have to work and we, you know, I'd like to have a life of my own. I thought when the kids went away and, you know, we've had our own life and we could, ah, travel and we could, you know, do more fun things and you know not just work all the time and it's pretty hard to fit that in, in the midst of all this. 

01:31:00
Summary 

01:31:00
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN It's-- and the-- that's very interesting because on one hand you've got your mother, you got your two daughters that are also making, uhm, if not demands on you, making you feel that you need to do some more for them. 

01:31:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right, yeah. 

01:31:15
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And-- but there's a piece of you that says, hey, I want my own life too. I reach the point where not only I do enjoy my work but we can travel. We've got some freedom and how am I gonna start doing that again? And how am I gonna get myself? 

01:31:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I don't know where this time for that right now. Doesn't feel like there's much time for that but that sure would be, that sure would be something I'd like to work towards. 

01:31:35
Summary 

01:31:35
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN All right. Okay, so let-- let's just go through one, you've got a mother that, - 

01:31:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:31:40
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - the problem isn't really gonna totally go away, you know that and I know that. 

01:31:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, I know. Uhm-mm. 

01:31:40
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN It's gonna be there and it's just to what extent it's gonna be there but you've got two brother, successful healthy charming daughters that ha-- are growing, you know, growing up and it's, - 

01:31:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:31:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - it's painful to see them still struggling. 

01:31:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

01:31:55
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN But they are? 

01:31:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, they are. Both of them are struggling. Yeah, that's right. 

01:32:00
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And but you know there's something that's gonna be going for a long time for you. 

01:32:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I'm, I'm afraid so. It's like, ah, I never thought. I thought sort of a-- would leave college and that would be it. 

01:32:05
Summary relates to previous session 

01:32:05
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN And, and then there's a piece of you said, you know, I'm an individual. I, I have a right and, and my husband is right to have me. 

01:32:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:32:15
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN This is what we waited for. We finally are able. We've got a successful business. We're financially comfortable. We're-- where's the time for us? And, and that's where I think maybe, ah, we get this piece. We're gonna have to try to figure out. I think you said it last week, set up some priorities, - 

01:32:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:32:30
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - so that I-- that you all can. 

01:32:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Set up some priorities so that, uhm, I feel something for myself in amidst of all these and I don't just fall apart when all these crisis happen cuz the crisis are gonna probably continue. So, got a-- sort of hold it together and keep myself healthy and, and do all things I need to do to be, uhm there for my husband and do the work we need to do. Uhm, at the same time managing these situation that I have going. Family, I'm going to family concerns. 

01:33:00
Summary 

01:33:00
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN I wonder if, if we have time for this because I, I haven't, - 

01:33:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:33:00
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - I mean, I, I think one of the things that we talk about and I think you realize, I think it was your suggestion, is that priorities. 

01:33:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:33:10
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN It's somehow if you can set your priorities, if you can deal with your mother, with your two daughters and with your husband in your work and maybe that's what we should work at. How do we, how do we prioritize Mary and how do we let Mary also take care of herself being a little selfish, - 

01:33:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:33:25
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN - which is okay, too. 

01:33:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY To do some-- that I wanna do for myself. Yeah. 

01:33:30
NORMA PACKARD GLUCKSTERN Uh-huh, good. 

01:33:35
Multicultural Comments Individual and Family Balance 

01:33:40
ALLEN IVEY I think we've all agree that Norma did a superb job of summarization. Here we have three or four even five summarization right at, right at the beginning. Ah, at the same the kind of resubmission-- I thought one thing she did wonderful was really to focus in on where is Mary, - 

01:33:55
DERYL BAILEY Uhm-mm. 

01:34:00
ALLEN IVEY - the word you, why are you seems to be important and I think that was useful to Mary to see where stood but on other hands there's other things that you need to be thinking about when we focus just on the individual. 

01:34:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right, uhm, I, I really, ah, appreciate that focus, uhm, ah, because, uhm, I, you know, I, I can understand how a counselor can direct that focus based on maybe his or her orientation, okay. And I, I think I would have focused on Mary but on a different way. 

01:34:30
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:34:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I would have focused on Mary and her family, - 

01:34:35
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:34:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - uhm, which is an interesting sort of, ah, awareness for me as a counselor that my own approach may direct the conversation and the problem solving for Mary, - 

01:34:45
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:34:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - and that family is very important. 

01:34:50
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:34:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Therefore, I'm gonna focus on her but also her relationship with her mother. So it was an interesting phenomenon to see how our approach just might have been different based on, on contacts and cultural differences. 

01:35:00
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. Cuz we've been taught in counselling where client is right there in front of us focus on a client, - 

01:35:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

01:35:05
ALLEN IVEY - and I think sometimes we've-- we need to think more about the contacts that the client with, Deryl? 

01:35:10
DERYL BAILEY I think, you know, you're absolutely right and I think one of the things that I would have probably had tried to do was do the same thing at home in terms of fo-- to getting Mary to focus on herself but getting Mary to come to that conclusion that I have to take care of myself before I can, you know, be very effective in taking care of the others but, uhm, get to that by allowing Mary to come to that conclusion. 

01:35:30
ALLEN IVEY It leaves us in the situation. The person who is totally focusing on a family and is really important that, that person focusing on itself-- their balance. 

01:35:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Exactly, so. 

01:35:40
ALLEN IVEY If they're totally focusing on themselves you wanna help them balance the other way. 

01:35:45
DERYL BAILEY Right, right. 

01:35:45
ALLEN IVEY And I think each culture will have different balances of what is appropriate. 

01:35:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, that's right. 

01:35:50
ALLEN IVEY And each individual will be different again. Do not stereotype. 

01:35:55
What balance of individual and family do YOU recommend? End Summary Five Stages of the Interview Allen Ivey and Azara Santiago-Rivera Introduction Mary Bradford Ivey 

01:36:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY In this interview, Allen will work with Azara and go through a full interview focusing primarily on listening skills. Real mastery of attending and listening occurs when you can work through a full interview without giving advice or direction and enabling the client to make his or her own decision with minimal influence by the councilor. 

01:36:40
Five Stages of the Interview Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring Stage 2: Gather Data Issues and Strength Stage 3: Set Goals Stage 4: Working Exploring Alternatives Stage 5: Terminating and Generalization 

01:36:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You will see the five stages of the interview demonstrated here. Number one, rapport and structuring. Spend necessary time tuning yourself in with the client in your own way and inform him or her of the purpose of the interview. Number two, defining the problem. Use a basic listing sequence to draw the client's issues. Be sure to spend time defining client's strengths. Remember that concrete question, could you give me a specific example used in varying form will be useful in all stages of the interview to expand and clarify what is happening. Number three, defining outcomes. Again the basic listing sequence can be helpful in drawing out the client sees as a goal or ideal outcome. Number four, exploring alternatives and generating solutions. Begin this session by summarizing the problem and the outcomes as desires. Ask the open question, could you tell me what ideas possibilities for resolution come to your mind? You will find that the organization of the problem offered by BLS and the five stage structure often helps many clients find new and workable problem solutions here. Number five, generalization. Through attending skills and questioning help your client define something specific he or she might do during the coming week to implement the ideas generated. 

01:38:15
The Interview Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring 

01:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Azara. 

01:38:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hi, Allen. How are you? 

01:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Nice to see you. 

01:38:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Thanks. 

01:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Thanks for coming in. 

01:38:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Thanks. Yeah, your welcome. 

01:38:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah, good. Azara, ah, I know you're probably ready to begin but before we start there's a few things in counselling I think we need to share as we start. Ah, first is that everything here is confidential and nothing you share except should there be something that, ah, which is obviously not the issues but if you would show possibly harming somebody or your herself, things like this, I would have to report you on prompting to tell me that. Other than those extreme situation the thing here is just between us, okay? 

01:38:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Sure. Yeah. 

01:38:55
ALLEN IVEY Ah, another thing is that, ah, I've been looking at your file and I see that you're interested in talking about some issues of possible discrimination on the job. 

01:39:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

01:39:10
ALLEN IVEY And I know you want to get started on that, uhm, but before we do, hey, we're kinda obviously, ah, look like the boss, ah, White male, type of people that made some of those decisions which you feel apparently from what you written already you're not real comfortable with and I wonder how you feel about sitting down and talking with me about something like this. 

01:39:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I certainly appreciate the fact that you've asked. 

01:39:35
ALLEN IVEY Uhm-mm. 

01:39:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, you know, uhm, I was real hesitant, ah, coming to talk to you about this because it's a-- I think it's a delicate situation that I'm in and I wasn't really sure if, ah, if a male counselor, uhm, from a different background would really understand my circumstances. So, thank you at least starting, starting out, ah, the discussion about that. I feel a little better actually that you're upfront about it so that's a good thing. 

01:40:05
ALLEN IVEY It's also say that, hey, I have, ah, been in Puerto Rico a few times and you've here our-- basically all the four, four corners of the, of the common wealth and know a little bit about it. 

01:40:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So you know about the island, that's great. Yeah. 

01:40:20
ALLEN IVEY So, ah, just before we start where are you-- where were you from on the island originally? 

01:40:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, my parents are from two very small towns actually on the island of Puerto Rico. My mother is from this little called Sabana Seca, - 

01:40:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:40:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - and my dad is from Fajardo. 

01:40:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:40:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So, ah, and I have family that live on the islands so it's a-- I hope you had a good time while you were there. 

01:40:40
ALLEN IVEY Oh absolutely. 

01:40:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

01:40:40
ALLEN IVEY We did all the wonderful thing. 

01:40:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh great. 

01:40:45
ALLEN IVEY We're very lucky to be there and I work with some friends of mine, ah, who are, are Puerto Ricans. So, I have some background but nonetheless, you know, even though I have some background, you know, obviously not come, come from your background and we also have the issue of gender. So if I, I want you to feel very free to-- if you feel uncomfortable, I really like you to know but let me know that you're not feeling comfortable. 

01:41:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Thanks, okay. 

01:41:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Is there anything you wanna ask me personally before we start. 

01:41:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA No, I think we should get started. Yeah, let's get started. 

01:41:15
STOP THE VIDEO How do you feel about the sharing demonstrated here? Allen next structures the interview 

01:41:25
ALLEN IVEY I would like to tell you that, ah, what we're gonna do first is, ah, in the interview like kinda like learn a little bit about the issues that you're bringing. And, ah, but one thing I like to do is we talk about-- after we talk about your issues and I do wanna come back to your strengths and, ah, some of the stuff that you have and you already mention, ah, some stuff from Puerto Rico that obviously the stre-- I see you smile as you talk about Puerto Rico. I think that's obviously an important part. We'll talk about that later. And then after we've sort of look at the issues, concerns that you have, ah, and some strengths, ah, we're gonna turn to, what are your goals and what do you really wanna have-- happen. I found unless we have a direction it's kinda like if you don't where you're going we may end up somewhere else. So later down the session we'll look at goals. And then we're going to look at some possibilities for problem solving, generating possibilities. And the finally, I hope we leave today with something specific that you can do isn't just talking about it. I hope there's some action we can take. So that's what I'd-- sort of outline for this session. Does that sound reasonable? 

01:42:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, it sounds like a pretty, pretty complete plan. Yeah, that's like, it's gonna work. Thanks. 

01:42:35
Stage 2: Gathering Data Issues and Strengths Open question 

01:42:40
ALLEN IVEY So let's begin now. It's in the file that you have some problems on the job, ah, promotion and so forth. Could you tell me, tell me what's going on? 

01:42:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay, well, uhm, a few days ago, I found out that, uhm, that I was passed over for a promotion. 

01:43:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:43:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm pretty, I'm pretty upset about that because, uhm, I think that I'm due to promotion. 

01:43:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think I'm qualified and I'm, you know, I'm just really, I'm really annoyed about the whole process. And, ah, well, you see that, ah, that the promo-- the, the person that I was competing with, - 

01:43:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - is, uhm, is, ah, another male. 

01:43:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And he has only five years' experience. I have 15 years' experience in this company. 

01:43:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I thought I was doing all the right things. 

01:43:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I get along with my supervisor. I have-- I thought-- I think I have a great, great relationships with my coworkers. By the ways, that's very important to me. It's very important to me to have, you know, to work in a place where you really like the people you work with, you know, - 

01:43:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - having moved here 15 years ago, uhm, this is like my extended family. 

01:43:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:43:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA When I, you know, I'd, ah, it's just part of who I am and part of the way I'd been brought up to have, to have that you've, you know, that you get along with and, - 

01:44:00
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:44:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - that supports you and so I worked very hard to create that in, in the job because you spend so much time work-- at work, you know. 

01:44:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

01:44:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So anyway, I, I did all-- I thought I did, did all the right things to get this promotion, - 

01:44:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:44:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - and I-- it, it-- I'm just made because somebody else got this job and my boss encourage me to apply, my coworkers encourage me to apply. You know, I've given 15 years of my life to this place and I, I get passed over so. 

01:44:30
When a client defines a problem, an early summary of what you heard may be helpful. Summary 

01:44:35
ALLEN IVEY You've been set telling me a lot of things and a lot of things that you really care about. First of all, kind, kind of summarize what I've heard, ah, cuz I really wanna be with you on this. First, ah, I really wanna say, you really sound angry and frustrated, ah, if I-- and I, - 

01:44:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

01:44:50
ALLEN IVEY - got that feeling you've got mad. 

01:44:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, yes. 

01:44:55
ALLEN IVEY You nod your head. It's really there. Ah, it's really a deep cut feeling. And then the next thing I hear really is you've done a good job 15 years and then sort of summary the big, the big issue is, boom, here comes, ah, a guy that's been here a shorter time, ah, a White male, he gets your job. 

01:45:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

01:45:15
Check-out 

01:45:15
ALLEN IVEY And then a piece of this which we don't fully get is, ah, ah, relationships are really important to you on the job, ah, and, ah, maybe I miss this but we wasn't quite sure how that fit, ah, with, with, with your concerns. Now, by the way, is there anything that really essential that I miss so far? 

01:45:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I guess it's, uhm, it's, ah, you know, trying very hard to create on that resort. Everybody, everybody works together and gets along, - 

01:45:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:45:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - cuz we don't have to get, you know, our jobs done so I end and, ah, you know, I guess having the support from my coworkers, ah, is important to me, you know. I guess, that's where it fits in. 

01:46:00
Paraphrase 

01:46:00
ALLEN IVEY So the relationship with your coworkers are really important. 

01:46:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It's important to me. 

01:46:00
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, it's important. And I-- and, you know, so in other words I think that I work in a great atmosphere. 

01:46:10
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I, you know, I, I get along with my supervisor. 

01:46:10
Reflection of feeling 

01:46:10
ALLEN IVEY Whether you like your job, you like your colleagues. 

01:46:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I like my job. I like my colleagues. All of those things are really wonderful, Allen. And then, you know, I'm thinking that this whole getting passed over for this promotion is discrimination. 

01:46:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:46:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think it's discrimination. I think it's discrimination. I think that I really had been discriminated against here. 

01:46:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I don't know what to do about it. 

01:46:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Because I don't want to get anyone angry at me. I don't want, I don't wanna... 

01:46:35
Reflection of feeling 

01:46:35
ALLEN IVEY Aha! I thought that brings it to me now. You don't want anybody angry at you. 

01:46:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I don't want-- I don't know and, and do I, do I open up a can of worms here, - 

01:46:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - by filling a discri-- by filling a complaint against, you know, against, against them. Met the owner of this company and manager of this company? 

01:46:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:46:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA What do I do? I wanna do something because I think it's-- it just not right but I-- I'm also afraid of the consequences. I think that I'm, - 

01:47:00
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:47:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, I think they'll be negative consequences. I think I could lose my job. I don't wanna lose my job. 

01:47:05
Reflection of feeling Paraphrase 

01:47:05
ALLEN IVEY So there's-- not only is there anger and frustration, there's little fear and then I hear about your, mmm, none of this is right, right here but caring involvement with your coworkers. Don't want to upset them and so you're torn in serval different direction and I kind of hear underneath it all that clearly you want to do something about it. 

01:47:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I... 

01:47:30
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:47:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Part of me wants to do something about this, yes. 

01:47:35
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. Part of you wants to do something about it and what's the other part? 

01:47:35
Encourage and "Why" question 

01:47:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It's afraid of the consequences. 

01:47:40
ALLEN IVEY Afraid of the consequences. As-- and why are you afraid of the consequences? 

01:47:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, cuz I don't wanna lose my jo-- I don't wanna lose my job. I don't wanna lose my friends. I've, ah, I've established in the company and my cowor... 

01:47:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. And filling a discrimination suit can be very, very painful. 

01:47:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It could be painful for me. It could be painful for my friends, my colleagues and I'm not only one that's had this problem, you know, there are others who've shared that they've also had problems like this where, you know, you know, there had been racial remarks. There had been, you know, - 

01:48:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:48:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - uhm, people being, being not hired because, because they don't, they don't speak very good English. 

01:48:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:48:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know, things like si-- so, I'm just really-- this is bothering and confusing. I'm very mad. 

01:48:20
Summary 

01:48:20
ALLEN IVEY So you're getting in a conflict situation. You've done well, got along everything you want. 

01:48:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

01:48:25
ALLEN IVEY And sort of focusing on your need to make a decision and do something but then you've got kind of some baggages kind of like from the past where you don't feel you're alone in this type of issue. 

01:48:35
Encourage 

01:48:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I know I'm not alone. 

01:48:35
ALLEN IVEY You know you're not alone. Okay. 

01:48:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I know I'm not. 

01:48:40
With a general sense of her concerns, Allen now reviews some strengths. 

01:48:45
ALLEN IVEY What I'd like to do as I said at the beginning, ah, is that-- just, just this hope that I'm holding for just little while to explore a little more in a few minutes. But I'd like, you know, even, even feel my own get a little tension because I can really, ah, understand, ah, this certainly-- partially where you're coming from. You're dealing with a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff, you know. 

01:49:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

01:49:10
ALLEN IVEY And so, I'd like to spoke for a minute on some of the strength cuz you wouldn't be with the place 15 years, you wouldn't enjoy it so much et cetera, you wouldn't be looking at emotional at all, I think there were some really strengths. So you tell me some of the things that you done well on the job, that you like and so forth. I just like to know some of those because sometimes we could solve problems from positive strengths. 

01:49:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh well, okay. I have, uhm, I think I've-- I'm very-- I'm task-oriented. I, you know, I've, ah, I'm, I'm organized, - 

01:49:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:49:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - in my work. So, uhm, I think I'm very good with keeping deadlines. 

01:49:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:49:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I've, I've-- I have been very careful about when, you know, I have a report to do or I have something I need to do I get it done, I get it done at the time timely fashion. 

01:49:55
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:49:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think that's a strength. 

01:50:00
Reflection of feeling 

01:50:00
ALLEN IVEY I hear some satisfaction and pride in that. 

01:50:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. And I, I, you know, I think I put together good reports, you know, and I, I do my best at that. 

01:50:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:50:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That's wo-- that's one thing and the other thing I think that I think is a strength but, you know, I, I think I get along with people. I work, I work hard at making sure that people are comfortable that they know, - 

01:50:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:50:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - that I'm, I'm sociable. Ah, I like to make friends. It's, it's that whole extended family, you know, we're all in this together. 

01:50:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:50:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA It's, it's, you know, I-- so I, I think that's a strength that I apply to the job. 

01:50:30
Summary 

01:50:30
ALLEN IVEY And I hear you're caring for extended family. Anything that I heard which of a strength in the middle of, you know, also it could tear you, as I heard you talking about some other people that, ah, or perhaps people with color or-- and you felt they were discriminated but I hear in strength that you're able to hang on while seeing what's going wrong. I mean, how, how was it for you when things weren't going so well? What happened? 

01:50:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, what, what I've, what I've done is, uhm, you know, in cases like that where either I know it's been-- somebody has been-- there's been blatant, in my opinion, - 

01:51:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:51:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - uhm, a comment made about someone based on their ethnic background for example. 

01:51:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:51:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know, using a derogatory term. I've gone to that person and I've said, you know, I, I can relate to this. Why don't we talk about it, - 

01:51:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:51:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, ah, let's, you know, try to work these things through cuz I know that we're one of very, - 

01:51:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:51:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - people of color in the company and you know, I know what it's like. I share this with you, let's, you know, I've, I've done that and it's... 

01:51:35
Paraphrase 

01:51:35
ALLEN IVEY So your style has been to go and support that person. 

01:51:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ex-- exactly. 

01:51:35
ALLEN IVEY And you have the strength to do this. 

01:51:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, that's what I've done. But, you know, I'm, I'm getting to the point where I'm tired. 

01:51:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:51:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm really tired of this now, Allen. I'm just, uhm, it's-- I have to do something, - 

01:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:51:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - because this can't go on anymore in the company. 

01:51:50
Paraphrase Reflection of feeling 

01:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Well, I kind of-- okay. Well, this can't go on anymore in the company. What I kinda hear you saying is that it isn't just you there's almost an atmosphere within the total company. Your anger and your frustration for you and for other people in the past. 

01:52:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think it's getting all the worst. 

01:52:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:52:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, I think it's-- I think this-- the racial tension and, ah, and the lack of diversity in the company and, and the people who are of different cultural ethic, you know, very few of us, - 

01:52:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:52:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, we've, ah, we've had to work twice as hard to get where we are. You know, it's just almost, the stuff is going on in my head right now. 

01:52:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:52:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I'm it-- it's gone. It's-- the reason why I'm thinking about this now is because this promotion thing. It didn't happen. 

01:52:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:52:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And this, this triggered a whole complicated, you know, thoughts about what to do next and all. This is now surfacing, uhm, and I need to do something. 

01:52:40
Encourage / Reflection of feeling. 

01:52:45
ALLEN IVEY We need to do something. And let's start focusing on that shortly but one more thing I wanted to do is, ah, I get the, the strengths. I hear a lot of strength but, ah, determination, I hear the caring, I hear the frustration and anger and now I kinda learned isn't just anger for you. It's anger for a whole total situation but that's helpful to me. Now let's stop for a moment and, ah, I saw you smiling so much when you're talking about your growing up in Puerto Rico and I-- one thing that help if I can sort of hear a palliative pleasant story from the childhood of-- which maybe even represents some story of strength in yourself, your family or your culture. 

01:53:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Wow! A lot of stories to share. Uhm, well, you know, ah, an image that comes to mind is, ah, just as spending a weekend with, ah, with, with my family on the island and going to the beach and, ah, - 

01:53:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:53:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, having a, having a picnic, you know, - 

01:53:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:53:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - on the beach and, and, ah, the, the sense of comfort, you know, - 

01:53:50
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:53:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - and, and closeness and, you know, things that, you know, you just find that they're important, you know. 

01:53:55
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:53:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Especially, the older you get, the more important that become very much seems to me. 

01:54:00
Reflecting nonverbals 

01:54:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. It's-- you know, and I notice just how your-- you just-- to me I see your body changing, your smiling and, and relaxing and... 

01:54:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm a little bit more relaxed now. 

01:54:10
ALLEN IVEY And I, I hear there a, a foundation, ah, of kind of ultimately comfort with who you are and where you come from. Did I got that? 

01:54:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. Yes, you do. 

01:54:20
Summary of strengths 

01:54:25
ALLEN IVEY So we have a foundation within your family from you're come from in Puerto Rico that we could draw other strengths like that, ah, ah, that in fact is the comfort with yourself and I, I just like the way you look when I say that. It makes me feel good. 

01:54:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think you hit home as one would say. 

01:54:40
ALLEN IVEY Let's kind of remember that comfortable base. 

01:54:50
Stage 3: Goal Setting 

01:54:55
ALLEN IVEY Ah, the next thing I like to do is, ah, I said earlier, you don't know where you're going until you've got goal. Ah, if you don't know where you're heading you may end up somewhere else. What would be your goal or goals in this situation? And maybe we can ship away that. 

01:55:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I really want to, to talk to someone about filling a complaint. That's, that's a goal. Ha-- how to get there... 

01:55:25
ALLEN IVEY So, so far you really haven't talk to anyone. 

01:55:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA No. 

01:55:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay, so which is barely-- okay. 

01:55:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You're the first ba-- this is the-- you're the first person I've talked about this cuz I wanted to get a sense, you know, ah, I guess whether or not this is a good, a good thing for me to do. I felt-- I feel like I am, you know, not, not really sure but I think... 

01:55:40
ALLEN IVEY Will that comfort base from who you are? It's gonna be a good place to start and we need to keep that comfort when we do our decision, okay. Ah, so, you like to talk to someone and so forth, ah, that seems to be one, one goal as the-- at least get it out and start talking. Other goals that come to our mind? 

01:56:00
Encourage 

01:56:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I want to-- I wanna get a promotion. I want... 

01:56:05
ALLEN IVEY I want that promotion. 

01:56:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I want that promotion. I think I'd-- I deserve that promotion. 

01:56:10
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:56:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, you know, if another opportunity comes up for example I, I should be able to go to my supervisor and ask, ask, ask him, you know, am I ready? You know, the seems to be a good match and I, I want him beside-- I am and I wanna be able to get the next time. So that's another goal. 

01:56:25
Open questions around filing suit 

01:56:25
ALLEN IVEY Pretty critical issue is the goals in-- to get, to get the decision next time, ah, how does this tie in with the, ah, possible filling. So do you, you want to file a suit or you wanna make a decision about filing a suit? 

01:56:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That's a good question. I wanna file a suit. 

01:56:45
Encourage 

01:56:45
ALLEN IVEY You wanna file a suit. 

01:56:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I wanna file a complaint, yes. 

01:56:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:56:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think it's time to do that. I think, I think it's important to do that now, yes. 

01:56:50
Summary 

01:56:50
ALLEN IVEY So you've-- I hear-- the goals as you wanna talk to someone, ah, you do-- you would like to get the job next time. It sounds like you don't feel you'll gonna get it this time, - 

01:57:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well... 

01:57:00
ALLEN IVEY - but you would like to file a suit, speak up, is that? 

01:57:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

01:57:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:57:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, yes. 

01:57:05
Closed question 

01:57:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, any other goals that you might have? 

01:57:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think that's the start. 

01:57:10
Encourage / Open question 

01:57:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Mmm-mm, I would just ask one question going back to something you said. I heard you were concerned about the company's total attitude toward people colored minorities. Is, is there any-- you are concern about this. Any goals you might have where I can chip it away it all but is there any goals there as you might have? 

01:57:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, if I can play a role in, in getting this company to understand that it needs to actively recruit and, you know, start diversifying with company I-- you know, if I can somehow make a contribution there in this whole process that would be a goal. 

01:57:50
Stage 4: Working Exploring Alternatives Summary Open question 

01:57:55
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Okay, so we have some possibilities that we're not-- we may not achieve them all today but perhaps over time we can work out on them. Ah, what I like to turn to now is this sort of let's explore some alternatives that, that occur to you and, ah, you're the expert on this so I would just kinda like to ask you some questions and mainly listen. But I've heard, in fact, your concerns, your issues, problem really concerned about you've been passed over your anger and frustrated, ah, you feel you're working at an atmosphere of, of, ah, discrimination. You feel that your confidence is not been recognized. Ah, along with that I hear these real strengths of you. You've done a good job, you get along to colleagues and do well. So they're kind of-- just kind of where the issue is about. On the other hand, I hear really kind of four concrete goals. When you take that thing of the issues and your strengths and the goals, what occurs to you is some possibilities, ah, that we might think about, ah, for resolution as we sort of sort these things out. 

01:59:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. Well, I think the first things I do need to talk to human resources, uhm, about, about filling a complaint that would be, - 

01:59:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:59:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - my first step, I think is to, is to go to human resources and, and talk to someone about that process, you know. I have to understand how that process is. I'm not so clear what that is. 

01:59:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

01:59:25
Encourage 

01:59:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, I, I also think that one way is to go to my supervisor and talk to my supervisor about this and having a chance to do that because I just found out a few days ago and, you know, like I'd been shock since then. 

01:59:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. Shock. 

01:59:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So those are I guess two basic things I need to do. 

01:59:45
ALLEN IVEY So one is really go to human resources, ah, how well acquainted are you to the people on human resources? 

01:59:55
Encourage 

01:59:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh, I know the, I know the director so I, you know, I can-- I feel comfortable talking to the director. 

02:00:00
ALLEN IVEY You do feel comfortable? 

02:00:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, I do. I think I'm ready to do that. Uhm, and be-- it would be okay with that. 

02:00:05
Reflection of feeling 

02:00:05
ALLEN IVEY And so you feel, you feel even though your concern about some of the other staff you do feel enough comfort and trust that you're going to talk to him. 

02:00:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA To talk to-- yes, I do. Yeah. 

02:00:15
ALLEN IVEY That-- that's very helpful, you know. You look, you look like you're. . . 

02:00:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Also that's... 

02:00:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, go ahead. 

02:00:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That's actually a positive thing. I just realize that, that would be a positive, I didn't think that the human resources would be a key person on this and, and yet, ah, the person is so this is a good thing. 

02:00:25
Summary 

02:00:25
ALLEN IVEY So even-- so you're-- in a sense, what you're telling me, Azara, you'd been so upset by this that you really gonna focus on, on, on-- immediately on the suit and then so you have the background for that. You have-- you really have enough time to think about it. The idea of going to human resources is a-- and you can smile. Did you feel that you're gonna get some support there? 

02:00:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think so. 

02:00:45
Advice Reflection of feeling Open question 

02:00:50
ALLEN IVEY And you also said talking to your boss and, ah, I would say it's probably good idea not to talk to your boss at first when you're really upset and shock. Now that you, ah, thought about it you feel that you would come and talk with him, ah, how if-- how was things gone in the past when you talk to him about difficult issues? How was he then? 

02:01:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think he's been fairly supportive. You know, I think we have, we have a good relationship so I'm, I'm not, I'm not con-- I'm not afraid to speak to, ah, to my supervisors. So, I can do that too. 

02:01:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:01:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That would be a good thing. 

02:01:25
ALLEN IVEY What do you expect might come from these two conversations? Ah, first in an ideal way and, and maybe in a less than ideal way? 

02:01:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. I-- well, I think the human resources person will probably tell me, you know, I support you. It's been-- but it's going to be a long process. 

02:01:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:01:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And I, and I expect that. I expect that kind of. I just-- response from, from the director of human resources. 

02:01:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:01:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, when I... 

02:01:50
Open question 

02:01:50
ALLEN IVEY How are you gonna feel when he says, well, it will take a long, I can just see the universe or I understand what you're feeling and here's the rule that that, that that's gonna take a long-- how that is going to cross with you? So we kinda knowing looking here what you might expect? 

02:02:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I think it's gonna frustrate me a little bit. 

02:02:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:02:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA But, ah, having, having sort of this with you I realized that, that, ah, that is the way it's going to be. Ah, I know, if there's a process involved then I, I just have to sit back and, and let that process happen, uhm, and be, and be a little patient with it. 

02:02:20
Drawing on positive strengths 

02:02:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, and so you, you may be supportive in the past but I think no person, no director is can kind of get back like this, ah, when this thing happens so we got to be ready to expect some of the frustration. 

02:02:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

02:02:35
ALLEN IVEY And that's where some of that ability to bow again and feel that underlying feeling comfort and sureness of yourself is going to be helpful, right? 

02:02:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, it will be helpful. Yeah. 

02:02:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm, and then when you feel yourself going like this, Azara can draw back and say, aha! Mmm-mm? 

02:02:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I have to do some more of that if some things happen. 

02:02:50
ALLEN IVEY If we had-- one thing we can do perhaps in another session a little bit of role playing of some things that might happen, we won't do it here today but we could go through a role play.

ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:03:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - we have a, we have a solid working relationship and, and, ah, so I think-- I, I think I-- because of all the, you know, the frustration and just, just the shock of learning about this. I didn't even think about going to him first, until today. So I think it's important to talk to, to him today about, ah, you know, or this afternoon after we, we have this or tomorrow, - 

02:03:35
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:03:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - is that-- is to, is to go and mention this and you know, basically say to him, you know, I've-- I'm little upset that I have this passed over. I need to know why. You have to give me specific. Yeah, I'd like to know why, - 

02:03:45

02:03:55
Paraphrase 

02:03:55
ALLEN IVEY So you're going to have that sort of same potential vendor that is a potential danger. It was a loss you're going to live with. 

02:03:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I know, I could, I could. Right, I, you know, I could get a little frustrated after speaking with him. 

02:04:05
Paraphrase / Close question 

02:04:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. So what you think is support-- you think they're gonna be supported that-- will they-- so that I think that's important to keep in mind. Ah, have you-- in the past you mentioned that there is some other issues of discrimination. Have you talk to your boss about those in the past? 

02:04:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. Yeah, I have. 

02:04:20
ALLEN IVEY And how was he responding to them at that point? 

02:04:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know, it's like, I don't know, ah, I hear you, I support you but I don't what I can do about it. 

02:04:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:04:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So that's, you know, that's been, that's been a-- I think a, a concern of mine too as, uhm, you know, the fear that it stops there. It doesn't go anywhere else and you know, I'm, I'm getting tired of that. 

02:04:45
Open question 

02:04:45
ALLEN IVEY It could be some very nice sky as you do a lot of talking. They don't do a lot of walking or action. 

02:04:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

02:04:50
ALLEN IVEY Where do you see on that-- on this? 

02:04:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, like-- he's like in the middle. 

02:04:50
ALLEN IVEY In the middle.

02:04:55
Paraphrase 

02:04:55
ALLEN IVEY That you might be quite supportive or you might say, well, this is your show. 

02:05:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

02:05:00
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:05:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And if it is my show, then, I think that's really good, the concern is good. It's going to be my show, only my show. I would like the support that I once had. 

02:05:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:05:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know, it's just that sort of thing. 

02:05:20
ALLEN IVEY So the-- you can start-- beginning a picture where, where you stand. Ah, I wonder if there's anything from the, ah, with the issue also how do you present that to them? And, ah... 

02:05:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Whether I'm angry, do I do it in an angry way or do I do it in a very calm way? I think I'd been pretty calm. 

02:05:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:05:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Maybe I need to get angry. 

02:05:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:05:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Maybe I need to show a little bit more anger. 

02:05:45
Paraphrase / Reflection of feeling 

02:05:45
ALLEN IVEY So far do you say you're underlying or be calmed that, ah, the issue of showing some of your anger and frustration you think might be wise at this point? 

02:05:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think so. Maybe I need to make-- it look like it's, uhm, I'm really serious about this. 

02:06:00
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:06:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And you know that it's not. I'm just gonna take it, you know, that it's, it's-- I wonder, I wonder. 

02:06:05
Draws on strengths 

02:06:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. Now one thing you've talk about in the past that you have-- you re-- you care about your relationships there. 

02:06:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I do with, with my coworkers, I do. I really care for great people. 

02:06:15
Paraphrase 

02:06:15
ALLEN IVEY Cuz sometimes you have your stuff that under rather than speaking out as full as you might. 

02:06:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, yes. I have-- I haven't taken that step myself because, because like I said I think I'm going to-- I think I'm gonna lose the battle. 

02:06:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:06:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm gonna lose it and, and I'm concerned about, about how, ah, you know, they could lose their job, Allen, you know? 

02:06:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm, yeah. 

02:06:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I mean, there's, there's a degree of fear as we call this. 

02:06:45
Reflection of feeling 

02:06:45
ALLEN IVEY So the fear is really still there? 

02:06:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think so. 

02:06:45
Document discrimination in writing 

02:06:45
ALLEN IVEY So really thinking through how you're gonna approach this. This is gonna be really important. Ah, one thing that sometimes help is, is writing down some of the issues, ah, and, and having them kind of an outline form who, ah, taking time yet to, to outline maybe both historically and so forth. 

02:07:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Haven't done that. That would-- that's-- that would-- that's the thing that I can do when I, when I leave here today as to, as to, you know, start documenting all of this on paper and ways in which I could handle it and, you know, maybe that would help me kind of sort it out in my head. 

02:07:20
Open questions 

02:07:25
ALLEN IVEY And have you save all your personal records and evaluations from the past? 

02:07:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I have all of that. 

02:07:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. That in some situation like that they'd been known to disappear. 

02:07:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I have copies of everything. 

02:07:30
Paraphrase 

02:07:35
ALLEN IVEY You have copies of everything. Okay, so that, ah, you do have that type of solving that problem. 

02:07:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm very good of keeping my own-- my things in, in order. I've got lots-- I have all that, I think. 

02:07:45
ALLEN IVEY So the most immediate thing really is talking to people, gathering more data before we go on to next levels of action. 

02:07:55
10 minutes of further exploration of alternatives deleted Stage 5: Termination and Generalization Allen asks Azara to summarize what is important for her. 

02:08:10
ALLEN IVEY Now, we've talked about on this Azara, ah, that we'll going to have to go in just a few minutes, ah, as we come to this final part of interview, what is-- how is it then for you so far in this session and, ah, how would you put together what we've talked about? 

02:08:20
Azara summarizes session 

02:08:25

AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, you, you help me sort that out and that I can do this. That I, you know, that I'd-- I can do this but also being very much aware that I need to, to do this approach in a calm way. 

02:08:55
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:09:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah, you know, you mentioned sitting back and kind, ah, doing it differently rather than just approaching this with a very angry face. Uhm, - 

02:09:05
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:09:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - so I, I think that I feel like I have a plan. I feel much better about, - 

02:09:10
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:09:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - the next steps. I came in here very confused about what to do first. 

02:09:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:09:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And, and basically shock. 

02:09:15
Positive strengths in body

ALLEN IVEY So you feel you kinda have a plan. I'd like to just go back about to anytime you get in to some of these tight conversations, ah, when you think about you and your family together on the beach, that family comfort, where, where do you locate that feeling in your body? 

02:09:30

It's always there. Always there. Ah, and so, we have a plan but what, what you're gonna do tonight? 

02:10:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'll just gonna relax. 

02:10:15
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:10:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I think I'm gonna relax tonight and, ah, just think about what we have talk about and start writing down, you know, some of these ideas on paper and keep, keep, ah, keep my thoughts, you know, kind of focused on, on... 

02:10:35

02:11:25
Debriefing 

02:11:30
ALLEN IVEY Azara, how was that for you? 

02:11:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That was really great, Allen. 

02:11:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:11:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, you know, you've help me sort out, ah, all kinds of emotions, uhm, from frustration, confusion, uncertainty, - 

02:11:40
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:11:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - to working on a plan. I mean, you really took that steps, that process and it really work out well. I feel like I've got a plan now. 

02:11:50
ALLEN IVEY So the step by step thing work that well for you, - 

02:11:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes it did. 

02:11:55
ALLEN IVEY - in terms of decisions and all. 

02:11:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, it did, uhm, from, you know, I had-- as, uhm, as we, as we talked about in the session when I first approach you I thought I was very hesitant about disclosing, ah, - 

02:12:10
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:12:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - to another, you know, another male. 

02:12:10
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:12:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA In a White male, ah, who really, you know, doesn't know exactly what I've, what, what I've experienced so I felt like I could, ah, we could address that early on and I appreciate that, that you were aware of that. 

02:12:25
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:12:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And set it, set it, ah, you know, right up front, that helped and just, uhm, understanding that there are lots of dimensions to, to the problem and it's not just, ah, you know, work-related but there it's, ah, you know, my background is, is influenced and everything. So it was nice to be able to sort all that out. 

02:12:45
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:12:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

02:12:50
ALLEN IVEY So spanning-- we sort of started with you, just you and discrimination suit and we sort of expanded the issue. It seemed to be helpful to see a little bit more in the total context of things. 

02:13:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right, right. It is great. Yeah. 

02:13:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, how did you feel when I went to the issue of that-- when I ask you for an image of strength and you came up with, ah, the family and on the beach in Puerto Rico comfort, - 

02:13:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

02:13:15
ALLEN IVEY - how was that for you? 

02:13:15
Strength review often helpful 

02:13:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, you know, ah, that's a, that's a-- it was very effective for me because, uhm, I was focusing on all the negatives stuff. 

02:13:20
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:13:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA The feeling anxious and certain, my goodness, afraid, angry at the whole situation of being passed over for the, ah, promotion that I forgot that I could happy thoughts too and happy feelings associated with those thoughts and it was like a relief, it gave me a relief, ah, when you ask me to think about something really positive. 

02:13:45
ALLEN IVEY It was really nice for me in the interview because these things I started to feel-- I-- sometimes my own body gives an attention and then I could think of your comfort and come back to that and we get to smile and, - 

02:13:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

02:13:55
ALLEN IVEY - yeah, I can do this. 

02:13:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

02:13:55
ALLEN IVEY And then, ah, I felt better and you-- I see you tend to smile often when I would make those particular comments. If we to had, ah, more time and, ah, more-- just a demonstration I would have also definitely would have ask for an image of strength and just quickly, what image of strength crosses your mind from them had been there? 

02:14:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh, I can easily tell you that my mother is an image of strength. 

02:14:20
ALLEN IVEY Okay, so what I would do is to ask you for an image of your mother and then ask you again to locate in your body perhaps so that image is strength. A lot of people will sometimes kinda like this, my mother is very strong or my mother have a good heart, those type of things and again, ah, that image of strength is always with us if we will draw. 

02:14:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, yes. 

02:14:40
ALLEN IVEY I have images of strength in my own mother that I sometimes draw. So, yeah, but they're, they're with us, with us all the time if we can remember those. 

02:14:50
ALLEN IVEY That's right. 

02:14:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA So the, the positive approach, ah, I think is really, really critical. Ah, I like the idea that we gradually contextualize a problem. If you started it out with just a discrimination suit or not, - 

02:15:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

02:15:05
ALLEN IVEY - and we came up with the variety of alternatives, - 

02:15:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes, those are important, too. 

02:15:05
ALLEN IVEY - step by step. Ah, as a counselor, ah, I was particularly concerned about this was a-- kind of hot button situation and I wanted to make myself available for a phone call. How would you feel about that? 

02:15:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA That was comforting that, you know, that I'd wouldn't necessarily have to, ah, even though, you know, I think through this, through this work, uhm, I had the-- I have to-- I had to make some decisions about what to do next, - 

02:15:35
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. 

02:15:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - sets some real specific goals but not feeling like I was doing this all by myself without support. And so knowing that, you know, that you are available in the event if something goes wrong, uhm, is comforting I think in many ways and I, I, I appreciated that. 

02:15:55
ALLEN IVEY Now no interview is, ah, perfect whereas some low points the things that I was not quite so good on. 

02:16:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah, I think in my case is just having more, more time, a little more time to kinda sort things through, uhm, - 

02:16:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

02:16:10
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA - you know, coming up with a plan for me it-- is important. It was important but, but ne-- needing to stay a little bit more-- stay, stay a little bit longer with my-- with the way I was feeling. I was feeling, I was feeling really crappy, basically. 

02:16:30
ALLEN IVEY Mmm-mm. Mmm-mm. 

02:16:30
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And needed, ah, needed to have more time to kinda sort those feelings out. 

02:16:35
ALLEN IVEY And so, that's one of the problems in their television demonstration. 

02:16:35
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. Yes, it's only... 

02:16:35
ALLEN IVEY That first phase where I draw out the problem, - 

02:16:40
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Right. 

02:16:40
ALLEN IVEY - the problem is some of those key feelings. There's a real need to hang in, in that first part with more issues of exploring the concerns, challenges, feelings before moving toward, toward thing. I think it would be okay with my own self. I think it would be okay to bring it in the positive but then to go back and explore some of those negative issues more. So more exploration of the, of the-- just getting it out would be something if that would have been help-- helpful. 

02:17:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

02:17:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay, anything else you might wanna question or add? 

02:17:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Uhm, I, I wanted to add that the, uhm, you are very sensitive to my, to my background and I've-- I had-- that was important to me too that you, you know, you didn't dismiss, ah, the, the fact that I'm Latina and I have, ah, I'm very proud of my culture and my heritage and you wanted to make sure that you are okay with that dimension of myself and I oftentimes think that, that's how we need to, to approach our, our clients who come from different backgrounds is to be upfront and frank about that, ah, and making it, making it as important as the problem because it is important. 

02:17:50
ALLEN IVEY We are people in context. 

02:17:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

02:17:50
ALLEN IVEY And people of heritage rather than just individuals. 

02:17:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yes. 

02:17:55
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

02:17:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Great. 

02:17:55
ALLEN IVEY Thank you so much. 

02:17:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You're welcome
