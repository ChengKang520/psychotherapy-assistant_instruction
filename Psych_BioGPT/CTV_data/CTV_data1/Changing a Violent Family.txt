TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:25
JAY HALEY This is one of a series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapist as well as to change clients, since they must learn how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussions since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem-focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going into do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor, but the clients cannot. 

00:01:40
Changing A Violent Family 

00:01:45
JAY HALEY Okay, well tell us about this one(ph). 

00:01:45
Ah… This is a… ah… 

00:01:50
JAY HALEY Is this your first interview with him or? 

00:01:50
Ah… No, this is not my first interview with 'em, but it’s my first family therapy session with 'em. Ah… Mom got involved with friend number two and had a little boy named (inaudible ) about 10 years old. That relationship didn’t work out. She then got involved with another man, with him she had twin… twin girls. I think they're eight years old. Ah… What happened, ah… this past year, he works a lot and she left the children ah… home with the twins’ father. He ah… apparently lost his temper and beat the 10-year-old boy to the point where he had to be hospitalized. The father of the twins ah… went to jail. And I’m not sure if he’s still in jail or he's out of jail, but it was considered a criminal child abuse charge. All the children were removed and put in foster home. Ah… Mom has all the children back now. 

00:02:55
JAY HALEY How did she do that? 

00:03:00
Ah… She went to counseling, went to parenting classes. She did everything that Child Protective Services told her to do. Ah… And the children were all placed in counseling, but everybody had a different counselor. I saw… And you'll see her in there. Somebody else saw… eight. And then somebody else saw… who is ten, the victim. And then somebody saw the mother outside our agency. 

00:03:30
JAY HALEY This occurred after she had them all back? 

00:03:35
No, this occurred before she got 'em all back. She just got all the kids back. So… 

00:03:40
JAY HALEY What happened in therapy… In the multiple therapies when she got the kids back? 

00:03:45
It was a mess. 

00:03:45
JAY HALEY There were five therapists in this case, four attorneys, a probation officer and three supervisors. 

00:03:55
There’s a lot of fighting going on in the home, but the main fighting, I mean physical punching each other, goes on between… and my client who is eight, her name is… So from week to week, if my patient was improving, following the rules and going to bed and… and walking away from conflicts, then… would be worse. And then the next week… would be better and my client would be beating the hell out of everybody. And it's so, when mom tries to discipline them, ah… they don’t listen to her. 

00:04:30
JAY HALEY Is anybody else living in the home? 

00:04:35
Well, that’s funny you mentioned that, because she doesn’t have a phone, so I had a neighbor that I called yesterday. She jumped over the fence. She comes back uhh…uhh… you know, and apparently there’s a guy named… in the home. 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY What do you want in the ideal situation to solve this problem? How would you like the family to look when you're done with it? 

00:05:00
Define Goals 

00:05:00
I look like the… no more punching out and no one having to go to the emergency room. 

00:05:10
Clarifying the Hierarchy 

00:05:10
JAY HALEY One of the goals you should have, I think, is to clarify a hierarchy in the family. 

00:05:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:15
JAY HALEY That to have mother in charge of the boy, who is in charge of the twins. Twins are always a problem, because when they have difficulty they… they have difficulty with each other. 

00:05:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:30
JAY HALEY And nobody knows how to treat them when they are two people acting like one person. It’s very complicated. 

00:05:35
Hmm… 

00:05:40
JAY HALEY I don’t know how people raise the threes and the fours. 

00:05:40
(inaudible ). 

00:05:45
JAY HALEY But anyhow, I would keep in the back of your mind that whenever anything is happening that you let the twins to accept the boy being in charge or being helpful. And at the moment I gather they don’t. 

00:05:55
Ah…Uh… 

00:06:00
JAY HALEY But that's one of the… the hard issue, isn’t it? 

00:06:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:00
JAY HALEY One of the reason for having a good waiting room if they could (inaudible ) and you can see the boy. 

00:06:06
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:10
JAY HALEY And ask him whatever you'd like to ask. 

00:06:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:10
JAY HALEY Or see that want to enter both. 

00:06:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:15
JAY HALEY Or just see him and ask him what it's like to be twins. So, they… they realize that the trouble they're having is not what everybody has it's what everybody who has the (inaudible ). 

00:06:25
Normalizing the Issues 

00:06:25
Oh, okay! Thank you, yeah! So, what should I do when I go today? Should we just talk about what do they see as a ah… as a… the problem? 

00:06:40
JAY HALEY I would start with what do they see as a family… 

00:06:40
Okay. 

00:06:45
JAY HALEY …as a mother, as a father. Sometimes mother isn’t there, sometimes father. But some kind of description that could be drawn out of them. 

00:06:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:50
JAY HALEY What kind… I mean, the idea they must have over the family after that history must be simple. 

00:07:00
Hmm…Hmm… So their view of what a family should look like? 

00:07:00
JAY HALEY What their family should like. 

00:07:05
What their family should look like. Okay, alright! 

00:07:05
JAY HALEY Ask them if they ever saw another family with twins. 

00:07:10
Okay. 

00:07:10
JAY HALEY So that makes it unique (inaudible ). 

00:07:16
Okay. 

00:07:16
JAY HALEY Well, let's see how they… how they behave. 

00:07:16
OBSERVING THE FIRST FAMILY INTERVIEW 

00:07:20
JAY HALEY The therapist brings in the family composed of a mother, ten-year-old son and eight-year-old twins. They discuss raising twins as well as their special problem of violent hitting each other. The supervisor must come up with a plan to stop the hitting. The mother says she is thinking about giving up at least one of the twins back to Social Service because of the hitting. This would be tragic since this mother had worked so hard to get them all back from a foster home where they had been put when father was arrested for beating the son and putting him in the hospital. 

00:07:50
The Supervisor Proposes A Plan To Prevent Hitting 

00:07:55
JAY HALEY No hitting for a week. 

00:07:55
Okay! 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY Nobody hits anybody. 

00:08:00
Okay! 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY And if they don’t hit anybody… 

00:08:00
Yeah! 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY …you give 'em a quarter. 

00:08:05
I give 'em a quarter? 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:08:05
Everybody, each gets a quarter? 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY Each gets a quarter. But if they lay hand once, no quarter. 

00:08:10
Okay! I’ll do that. 

00:08:15
JAY HALEY They need some motivation. 

00:08:15
Well, let’s ante it up a bit. What about a dollar? 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY That’s too much. 

00:08:20
A quarter? 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY I don’t know. 

00:08:20
A dollar would be pretty good for seven years old. 

00:08:25
JAY HALEY They're pretty there. 

00:08:25
You know, what about… 

00:08:30
JAY HALEY You can make it a dollar if you want and you're gonna contribute it if it goes over a quarter. 

00:08:35
Now, guess what? 

00:08:35
Umm… 

00:08:35
You know what? 

00:08:35
What? 

00:08:40
If everybody here, including mom… 

00:08:40
Hmm… 

00:08:45
…can make it one whole week, from now this Thursday at 08:25 you guys can make it seven days with no hitting, everyone gets 50 cents. Oh! 50 cents, is that a deal? 

00:09:15
Hmm… 

00:09:15
Deal? 

00:09:20
Okay! 

00:09:25
Ah… (Inaudible ). 

00:09:26
You know what, you guaranteed. 

00:09:26
So in this family a hit would mean body contact, head, body, foot and also an intention to hit like if you do that. What if some hitting went on and you weren’t in the room mom and somebody comes and says, "mom, mom, they hit me", but you didn’t see it, would that count? 

00:09:50
No. 

00:09:50
No. 

00:09:50
So mom has to see the hit? 

00:09:50
Yes. 

00:09:50
No hitting. No ifs, ands or buts. There is no hitting. No hitting in this family. 

00:10:00
Period. 

00:10:00
If you hit, you don’t get the 50 cents. You lose the game. 

00:10:05
Who gives us the 50 cents? 

00:10:05
Her. 

00:10:10
I’m giving it to mom, and mom will give it to you next week. 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY What do you think about the morality of paying kids to behave themselves? 

00:10:15
No, I don't like that. 

00:10:15
JAY HALEY You don't like that? 

00:10:20
I like it, as much leverages you can get. 

00:10:20
DISCUSSING THE FIRST FAMILY INTERVIEW 

00:10:20
I don't care, I'll pay them a dollar. 

00:10:25
JAY HALEY Don’t give 'em a dollar now, you've promised a 50 cents. 

00:10:25
I know, I was willing to give as high as a dollar… 

00:10:30
Yeah! 

00:10:30
…you can't do it every week, then you'd run out of money. 

00:10:30
I mean, I think it's a leverage game. 

00:10:35
JAY HALEY It's a way of making a different process, 'cos they'll struggle, and they'll… they'll behave. The way they behave only around something clearly defined. 

00:10:45
I saw the… the twins lied(ph) up when I said 50 cents. They were like, ahh… 

00:10:50
JAY HALEY Well we know that… We know you're managing really well. 

00:10:55
That was my little… my… That's my dilemma. We've got a boy who is older, that's what I'm thinking you know. 

00:11:00
JAY HALEY That's true. 

00:11:00
So I didn't know if… 

00:11:05
JAY HALEY He should probably get a little extra. 

00:11:05
So I was gonna say, "okay, him a dollar", but then I thought, well then I didn't ask him (inaudible ). 

00:11:12
JAY HALEY No, then I think it would make bad for you (inaudible ), it should on them. 

00:11:16
Yeah. 

00:11:16
JAY HALEY Because they're all kids as well as than I recon. 

00:11:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY They've been pretty deviant(ph). 

00:11:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY And as a deviant, as a function of ah… showing people how not to behave. 

00:11:30
Thanks to Durkheim 

00:11:30
JAY HALEY Because they don’t know the rules on what not to behave until somebody breaks the rules and then they know. So each group, in order to be stable, has to have somebody break the rules and act strange. It's an interesting idea. So that it tends to brittle, when there are rest of the family(ph) begins to get stable, one of them (inaudible ), and that has to be dealt with. 

00:11:51
Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:55
You started to say that, you don’t… you don't make interpretations, 'cos they don't… aren’t useful. The people don't… Ah… It doesn't change anything. And what… what are your reasons for not addressing feelings is the same thing or you know? 

00:12:05
JAY HALEY Well it's… it's not that they… It’s not only that they don’t change, it gets in the way of the therapy. I mean, to encourage people to express their emotions is based on the idea of the theory of repression… 

00:12:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:20
JAY HALEY …that came out in the 19th century, that everybody should express their emotions and then they'd be (inaudible ) so express their ideas, and their own conscious ideas always. 

00:12:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY And I haven’t seen it to be very effective at all. It usually interferes with the relationship, because they get off into metaphor when they talk about feelings. 

00:12:40
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY And ah… if you want the metaphors that’s fine, but if you don’t, it's in the way of the therapy. 

00:12:45
And… And that's why I got, because it's like, like most of my trainings have been objections, relations. 

00:12:50
JAY HALEY It's a theory that was helpful to a lot of people. 

00:12:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:55
JAY HALEY Because they make the relationships in their head and then they move to my side and became family therapists. 

00:13:00
Yeah. 

00:13:00
JAY HALEY When they're keeping in the head though(ph), they haven't got there yet. 

00:13:05
Hmm…Hmm… Yeah. 

00:13:05
JAY HALEY I know… What if they hit each other again? 

00:13:10
PLANNING THE SECOND INTERVIEW A WEEK LATER 

00:13:10
Ah will… 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY You'll be disappointed? 

00:13:10
I’ll be very disappointed. (Inaudible ). 

00:13:18
JAY HALEY You’ve got to anticipate and think about what you would do. 

00:13:20
Then they pay you 50 cents, just kidding. 

00:13:25
JAY HALEY You have the choice. They didn’t hit each other or they did hit each other and you have to do something with it. Were everybody was happy? 

00:13:30
Yeah, they are. 

00:13:30
JAY HALEY And not telling the truth about who they are. The question for you is, are you gonna end up giving (inaudible ) even if they hit each other? 

00:13:40
No. 

00:13:45
JAY HALEY Okay, that’s clear. 

00:13:45
Maybe next week then. 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY You could postpone it. That’s right. 

00:13:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY Say, I’ll give you one more week to get it. 

00:13:55
That’s a good idea. 

00:13:55
JAY HALEY I know there is a compromise of some kind. 

00:14:00
Now, last week we… we… I think we left it off where ah… we were trying to put mom in charge and the oldest boy sort of second in charge and then we were trying to… I think reframe the (inaudible ) behavior is more the twin thing. 

00:14:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. You did that very well. 

00:14:15
Oh, well, thanks. I think we should kind of continue with that theme, because I don't think mom kind of… I think she heard it, but I don’t know if she believed it. 

00:14:25
JAY HALEY Well, she (inaudible ) finding it hard to raise twins after they were about six months old. It didn’t happ… Nothing happened from then on. 

00:14:35
Yeah. 

00:14:35
JAY HALEY So, think about this. You kinda deal with the 50 cents, 'cos they're gonna come in eager for their 50 cents. And you either have to do something with it at the moment or you could say to them, before this time is over, before this interview is over I’m gonna be offering 50 cents to those who didn’t hit each other. But ah… I’m not gonna do it now. That is, you can stretch it out if you want or put off the decision unless they are (inaudible ) really long to know if they made 50 cents. 

00:15:11
Okay, okay! Now, why would we do that, instead of the end than the beginning? 

00:15:15
JAY HALEY Because you have an anticlimax interview to help you pass out the money first. 

00:15:20
Yeah. 

00:15:25
JAY HALEY Everything else is kind of minor after that. 

00:15:25
Oh, okay! I know. 

00:15:30
JAY HALEY Well, it’s part of you, 'cos you raised the 50 cents from 25. 

00:15:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:35
JAY HALEY That ah… That made it real money. 

00:15:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:35
JAY HALEY And possibly you can buy something with it. Twenty-five is like a symbol, a token, but 50 cents is serious. When I would take all of the advantage of it as you can to find out more about the hitting or what they think of hitting or whatever you want to explore, you explore with them cooperating, because they have something coming. 

00:16:05
Okay, yeah! Yeah, it sounds good. 

00:16:05
JAY HALEY Then I'd see her her own way. I think you just ask her if she likes… And then say that you’d like to talk to her alone. Can you send the kids to the waiting room? You need her permission, that's what I mean. I would assume the kids are reflecting her state of mind. 

00:16:25
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:25
JAY HALEY And her state of relationship to you. 

00:16:30
Yeah. 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY Well let's… We're gonna do the magic computer if I think something to said or (inaudible ). 

00:16:40
Okay! 

00:16:40
JAY HALEY Okay? 

00:16:40
OBSERVING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:16:40
JAY HALEY Much of this session was the therapist getting the mother to say that she will not give up the children. Mother shouldn’t threaten abandonment of children if they don’t behave, particularly when they have been off in foster homes. The children hit and the therapist chose not to pay the 50 cents. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:10
JAY HALEY Many times you had kids strung out in Social Service. 

00:17:10
DISCUSSING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:17:10
JAY HALEY If get back with their families they're never sure they're gonna to stay. 

00:17:15
Yeah! 

00:17:15
JAY HALEY Because they've been kicked out before or moved on before. So, everything is making trouble to see if they'll put up with this. And they have motivations like that. 

00:17:25
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:25
JAY HALEY And I think it's best that you sit with him down or say… tell him you're never gonna give him up. 

00:17:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY That you're gonna keep for everyone, no matter how they behave and so on. 

00:17:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:35
JAY HALEY So they have some… I mean, that's what most kids feel about their (inaudible ). They're thinking, if I misbehave they'll throw me out of the family, you know. 

00:17:45
Yeah. 

00:17:45
JAY HALEY This is a unique situation. 

00:17:45
And this family is a possibility, because mom has gotten to the point where, and that’s why we wanted the family therapy, well she’s ready to get rid of… Yeah! Coming here, I just, you know, everything is always blamed on her, but I… I thought she was one of the most well behaved. 

00:18:00
JAY HALEY She was? 

00:18:00
She was! 

00:18:05
JAY HALEY She's one who provoked the other to hit, and then (inaudible ) get 50 cents. 

00:18:10
Ask one twin to provoke the other to hit which they typically do. A Most Ingenious Paradox 

00:18:10
JAY HALEY And then seemed too complicated at that moment. (Inaudible ). 

00:18:21
Ah…Huh… 

00:18:21
JAY HALEY Or they would do it secretly. 

00:18:21
Ah…Huh… 

00:18:21
JAY HALEY So, we had a person who wouldn’t know, that's all. 

00:18:25
Acting like a secret… 

00:18:25
JAY HALEY Because if they had a trouble maker like that then it's often very skillful provoking people and appearing perfectly innocent. 

00:18:35
Well that is… Because of all (inaudible ) on the front seat of the truck. 

00:18:37
Yeah. 

00:18:40
If they do not beat each other up, I gave them three little candies, they will get it only after they get inside the house. Because mom is (inaudible ) all these three kids in the front seat and… 

00:18:55
JAY HALEY I mean, there is two fathers involved, not involved, and they must have mothers. There’s mothers-in-law, the grandmothers of these kids. They must be involved in some way. And usually, if this kids making trouble, there's two adults in conflict over how to deal with it. There's a classical arrangement. But she doesn't have (inaudible ) except in social service. 

00:19:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:20
JAY HALEY That she's in conflict with all of the kids. 

00:19:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:20
JAY HALEY And still they misbehave. So, there has to be somebody else in there. 

00:19:25
Hmm… 

00:19:25
JAY HALEY Naturally, one mother-in-law is a little angry because she put her son in jail. 

00:19:35
Well, he’s the one that beat the kid, and the kid even went into the hospital. It was that father’s mother that’s not talking to her. She blames her. 

00:19:45
JAY HALEY Making sure that have been happened. 

00:19:45
Yeah, she wasn't even home. She was working and he's the one that beat him up. 

00:19:50
JAY HALEY People who hadn’t seen the family together think they're awful. And then when they see the family, they say, well, you know you see this (inaudible ), they're awful until you bring the family in and then the people say they must be misdiagnosed, they’re behaving like reasonable people. And I think that’s so (inaudible ), the way she's handling, that makes them behave in a reasonable way, compared with how they were behaving. 

00:20:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:15
JAY HALEY You do need a goal. That you gotta picture in your mind of how you would like them to be when you say goodbye. 

00:20:25
Okay. That’s good. 

00:20:30
JAY HALEY Well, okay. I thought that went well. 

00:20:30
It did. Excellent. 

00:20:30
PLANNING THE THIRD FAMILY INTERVIEW The Twins Take Turns at Being Evil 

00:20:30
JAY HALEY Very well the kids are going to deal with the kids very well, like you enjoyed them. And I think if see them alone without mother and you can just turn into a play therapy session. 

00:20:40
Yeah. 

00:20:45
JAY HALEY Unless you have an issue or a problem as you might have been so well. 

00:20:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:50
JAY HALEY Is the evil one given that name? 

00:20:55
No, that’s a term like… That's 'cos mom keeps saying how bad she is. 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY Her characterization is what? 

00:21:00
The evil twin. 

00:21:05
JAY HALEY They do say that? 

00:21:05
Well, no, but she says all sorts of stuff. Well that’s the one that acts ah… 

00:21:10
JAY HALEY A possibility would be that to say that the evil twin has had this burden too long, being evil. And it’s the other twin’s turn to have it sometimes. 

00:21:20
Okay. 

00:21:20
JAY HALEY And pass it over that they… and see how well she can behave equally like her twin. 

00:21:25
Okay! (Inaudible ). You know 'cos of (inaudible ) and stuff. 

00:21:31
JAY HALEY Oh, that's right! 

00:21:31
Yeah, dark! Okay well. 

00:21:35
JAY HALEY But you can then criticize the good one for not being evil enough. 

00:21:40
Yeah, let’s do it. 

00:21:40
JAY HALEY To see if you can transform that. You could make the boy (inaudible ) but something. 

00:21:47
Yeah, everybody something to do, okay. 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY You give the boy the… the position of saying whether it’s working or not. 

00:21:55
Okay! 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY How well is she doing, the evil twin? 

00:22:00
Okay, he’s like a referee. Right? 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY The referee. 

00:22:00
Okay, got it. 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY And mother is the supervisor. 

00:22:05
Okay! And ah… 

00:22:05
JAY HALEY You could start by just chatting about how they are doing or you can ask them to predict could one twin be acting like the other one? 

00:22:15
Okay, so, you know with ah… with baseball and the (inaudible ) all in town, everything what we can maybe do is, mom is like the manager of the baseball team, and brother is the referee, and then the twins are the you know the evil twin and the good twin. 

00:22:35
JAY HALEY The fielders. 

00:22:35
Huh? The fielders! Okay! And they’re to feel this way? Okay. 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY And then to be able to go 5 minutes this way. 

00:22:45
Okay, 5 minutes! Oh, I don’t even have my timer but… Oh, well, okay. 

00:22:50
JAY HALEY Somebody else in there should be able to keep the time. There’s no clock on that wall. 

00:22:55
Well, I’ll give them my watch. I'll give them my watch. 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY You better watch out. 

00:23:00
No, that kids are pretty good with my stuff. Ah… Okay! 

00:23:05
JAY HALEY It's just that… that room needs a blackboard and it needs a clock, you know. There are certain things a room should need. 

00:23:10
Yeah! Okay, let me see if I have my evil thing over there? Ah… 

00:23:15
It's gotta be every better. 

00:23:20
But ah… Okay, so ah… 

00:23:25
JAY HALEY (inaudible ). 

00:23:26
Well, help me out guys and you'll send it my way. 

00:23:30
(inaudible ). 

00:23:31
You’ve worked so hard on being that evil twin. Now we are going to change your job, okay? And guess who would I give it to? Because she’s such a wonderful actor and she’s going to be like an evil twin for 5 minutes. Hey now, mom, you’re the manager. You’re gonna let the referee know when to start the game and you guys… 

00:24:00
Yes, yes! 

00:24:00
…are going to play. You'll be the… Wait a minute, I'll put… I'll put magic dust. Oshh… Oh, you are now the good twin. And you wear such a pretty dress. And now, wait a minute. Woo… poof… Now, you’re that evil twin. Okay. Now, do you happen to have an evil twin voice? 

00:24:30
Yes. 

00:24:30
Oh! 

00:24:30
JAY HALEY The therapist moved the family’s positions. The good and evil twin change places with the boy coaching them to be more good or evil. The mother supervises the argument between the good and evil twins. They change back again. This is paradoxical, because you're instructing the evil twin to be evil and the good twin to be good. The evil twin is behaving good when she behaves evil on an instruction. The session ends as the mother passes out the 50 cents reinforcing the hierarchy. Paying a child for good behavior is like giving an allowance. 

00:25:05
DISCUSSING THE THIRD INTERVIEW 

00:25:10
The girl said something like, "I wanna be good… the good twin too." I think it was… 

00:25:15
…still a good twin? She said, "cool!" 

00:25:20
Oh, yeah that was it. That was the point over there when she said. (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:25:25
She wanted to be the good twin. 

00:25:25
She saw, put her hands on her hips and she was like (inaudible ). 

00:25:36
JAY HALEY One of things that was interesting is when the mother moved. The whole version just changed. 

00:25:40
Right. 

00:25:40
JAY HALEY Somebody suggested that and it made quite a difference. 

00:25:45
Good. 

00:25:45
JAY HALEY I'm the one that who can pass a mirror and others who can't. 

00:25:50
Yeah. 

00:25:50
JAY HALEY And she… Once she was in front of that… 

00:25:55
Yeah. 

00:25:55
JAY HALEY …then people are different on this. 

00:25:55
Yeah. 

00:26:00
I like the way you guys said they get the money for effort. 

00:26:00
JAY HALEY That was a nice (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:26:05
See, the kids got really disappointed when he wasn’t getting any… even though he controlled himself, he wasn’t getting (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:26:10
Yeah. 

00:26:10
That was really good, (inaudible ) just know because you were like within a few inches. But then I'm glad you did the effort thing because he… been the only one that got it. Because… did hit. He almost hit and of course… did volunteer to do dishes three times that week. So… When we… When you guys did the effort thing, everybody got it and it equalized everybody and then… talking like some of the things that she did and then mom started talking about all the good things that… actually did. That's really, really different. And it's not just because she's (inaudible ). I can tell you I talked to her over the phone and she, even last week she was very positive and stuff. And I think it’s because of the therapy. And we’re positive focused and we’re helping change. Yes! What do we do to try to cement some of this stuff? 

00:27:05
How about… What about (inaudible ) two good twins, you know and shift the focus away from an evil and you know, one should be evil (inaudible ). How about saying, did we have two good twins this week, because I think that’s the good goal, like mom said? 

00:27:15
JAY HALEY Quite a goal, just to get them participating with each other successfully. You know, I treated a pair of twins once and which they were about 17. And they said they never competed, because they ran the 100-yard dash at exactly the same speed. They swam 100 yards at exactly the same speed. They both had… They had twin girlfriends (inaudible ). And they were working on a car, which they shared. But they ah… They really were so competitive that they didn’t know they were competitive. But it made their behavior very positive. 

00:28:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY And these two you can make positive… If you could get them competing on something, it's what I would like to think of in some game or some skill or something. 

00:28:10
Not against each other, but you mean together? 

00:28:15
JAY HALEY Or against each other, but improving. What these other two twins did is when one got better at the 100-yard dash, he helped the other one learn how to… how to do it better, so that they could be exactly the same. But it takes twins I’m talking about… They had one thing that differentiated 'em, and that was one of 'em had a symptom. He blocked when he spoke. He had real difficulty speaking, and that made him different from the other one. And it seems so obvious when I saw him that something would have to be done about both of them in order to do something about that one. 

00:28:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY Because they really were so alike in every way that this is the one thing that that guy was individual with. 

00:28:55
It feels good because when I get stuck in therapy I just kind of, I feel good as I get like, oh there's actually somebody that can kind of help me you know with that. 

00:29:05
FOURTH INTERVIEW Disengagement 

00:29:05
JAY HALEY I suppose you said to them, if this was our last session, would you worry about that? What would they say? 

00:29:20
I think she would complain about the kids and what’s gonna happen to the boy? 

00:29:25
JAY HALEY Well, people when you say that to them usually go right to the problems that most worry them. And you know you can always say, I’m not saying that this is our last session, I’m just saying what the otherwise, and you can get out of that that way if they get upset. 

00:29:40
Okay! 

00:29:40
JAY HALEY But it defines the situation as temporary. And the clientele would put off doing things they do, well, I’ll do that later in the therapy sort of thing. And it helps to make it clear it's not gonna last long. 

00:29:55
We can do that and see what happens. 

00:30:00
JAY HALEY Think about how to terminate, which is one of the more interesting problems in the business, because ah… it’s a disengagement but that’s hard to do sometimes. Because if things are going well, you want to continue and they want to continue, and they’ll start making up problems in order to keep continuing. And it’s best to make it clear that this is temporary. I think part of the job of the supervisor is to help a client and the therapist to get separated, because it’s not easy. And ah… you have a tough judgment of, is the problem still there bad enough to continue or are they over? And really… And you just not presenting it that way. 

00:30:50
No, if you’re not sure, can you spread it out or are you better to cut it off? 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY No, the best way to do it is to say, let’s meet in tow weeks or in three weeks, or how about the first of the month. And then what happens is they get interested in other things, you get interested in other cases. 

00:31:05
Oh, okay, okay! 

00:31:10
JAY HALEY It’s for both of you really. 

00:31:10
I didn’t realize it was for both of us. That’s true. 

00:31:15
OBSERVING THE FOURTH INTERVIEW 

00:31:15
JAY HALEY In this session the therapist asks the family to say what is positive about brother this week. She asked for other resources such as grandparents and the church. Each member is asked to name one thing the family needs to do. 

00:31:30
JAY HALEY Would any of you'd have done that interview differently? 

00:31:35
The father just doesn’t want to see him probably as a revenge on the mother. 

00:31:40
DISCUSSING THE FOURTH INTERVIEW 

00:31:40
JAY HALEY The most basic thing really is to get mothers to say they’ll never leave the kid or the kid will never leave them. And they can say it casually, but really they have to say it and put it into words. They… They can think it, you know, I'm always gonna have this kid, but there is difference between thinking and saying it. Kids hear what the parents say. They don’t particularly watch what they do, but they listen them. So when a parent says, I have an awful job and it’s a pain in the ass, the kid thinks his father has an awful job, well actually the father likes work, but it’s a pain in the ass, you know. And… And those distinctions are hard for a kid. 

00:32:15
Right. 

00:32:15
JAY HALEY He feels it’s ambiguous where he is gonna be, you know, what he’s gonna do and who with? It’s… I mean, it's related to friends, it’s related to school, it’s related to so many disruptions in his life. So, it’s one of the most basic things. Parents can treat a kid badly as long as they made it clear they're gonna… he’s going to be their kid, you know. 

00:32:40
What did you guys think about when I… I hope I said that question, right? What if this is the last session together? 

00:32:45
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:32:50
(Inaudible )? 

00:32:51
JAY HALEY They were doing what? 

00:32:55
They didn’t say anything. You know, but it… it was upsetting to her, but to her I think. 

00:33:00
Oh, yeah! 

00:33:00
JAY HALEY You know… She’s very involved. And it isn’t time for the last session, but it’s time to… to say that's gonna happen so she doesn’t depend on you to do what she's gonna to have to do, you know. 

00:33:15
But I thought we were supposed to stay away from emotion, but now what are we supposed to do? 

00:33:20
JAY HALEY If they come out, if you deal with them. 

00:33:25
Oh, okay. Oh, no, emotion (inaudible ). No, like… 

00:33:35
JAY HALEY Mary Boleyn(ph) used to say you can use the word feeling. You can word think… you can think this, that's it. It was a prejudice against emotions in the field. You've talked to him? 

00:33:45
No, I haven’t talked to him. I’ve been going through the social worker and the social worker thinks it’s a really good idea. It’s just that she was waiting to hear from the last two attorneys. 

00:33:55
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:33:55
Just to make sure, and mom said she'll give him directions to the therapy. 

00:34:00
JAY HALEY It might help if you called him. 

00:34:00
Okay, I can call mom and see… 

00:34:05
JAY HALEY I mean, if that wouldn’t confuse all the other people involved with it. 

00:34:05
Well that would be… That's the only thing I've been letting a social worker handle it. And I hope… 

00:34:10
FIFTH INTERVIEW The Father Jailed For Beating Stepson Is Invited In 

00:34:10
He went to jail for physical abuse. He was there maybe I think around, I don’t know six months or whatever his sentence was. 

00:34:20
JAY HALEY Six months! 

00:34:20
Yeah, he was there quite some time. Ever! He’s going to church and they are a fundamental, (inaudible ) Christian kind of church, and he sits three pews back. He’s already I guess apologized either to the congregation or to the pastor. He’s already done some things. He’s gone to a domestic violence workshop, anger management workshop. He’s gone through all the parenting classes. 

00:34:50
JAY HALEY He’s gonna be a professional parent pretty soon. 

00:34:50
Yeah. 

00:34:55
JAY HALEY You measured distance by how many pews back? 

00:35:00
Yeah! Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:05
JAY HALEY Well, I think you need to explain to him something about what you’re up to. What you like to achieve and why you're seeing the family? So that you can work from there, because he doesn’t really know probably. 

00:35:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY He must know they come here but he must not know what for. Does anybody have a special way to open up this? 

00:35:30
No, I’ve never met him. 

00:35:30
Never even seen him? 

00:35:30
I've never met him. 

00:35:35
JAY HALEY I think it would be nice if you could by the end of the interview have a relationship or if he’s upset he call you. That he feels you’re on… on his side to survive in life. 

00:35:45
Really? 

00:35:50
JAY HALEY Yeah. I think you all ask him what he’d like to be doing five years from now. 

00:35:55
Okay. 

00:35:55
JAY HALEY So that he has a life that’s not just wrapped up with a kid he beat you know. 

00:36:00
Hmm… 

00:36:05
JAY HALEY I would try to get that passed and I'll clarify with him that the court is out of it and everything is out of it and the family can work out it’s own problems now. 

00:36:15
Hmm…Hmm… So at what point am I going to bring… 

00:36:20
JAY HALEY It depends on how far you get with him. 

00:36:20
Okay. 

00:36:25
JAY HALEY I think you should… I don’t know what he has been told, but you should tell him that you want to talk with him a while and then you bring… You want to see the two of them without the rest of the family. 

00:36:35
Hmm…Hmm… Yeah, I don’t wanna see rest of them, yeah. 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY Well, I'd just tell him that's what the agenda is so that he knows what's gonna happen. I would do it without making a big issue, give him some information, because you don’t know what he has been told or what’s been happening or… or what… what the… wants to see him or not. Somebody else have an idea around here? 

00:37:05
It's mom, that he has to forgive… he did to him or else he's gonna go to hell. 

00:37:15
JAY HALEY Well, he better do it then. 

00:37:15
Actually, that's what I told him. 

00:37:20
I asked him to sit in the truck. 

00:37:20
Why don’t you just start? 

00:37:25
JAY HALEY Why don’t you start with him and bringing him in? 

00:37:25
Okay. 

00:37:25
JAY HALEY (inaudible ). 

00:37:27
Okay, and a social worker is gonna help like baby sit or whatever you mi… what you need her to do. 

00:37:30
JAY HALEY Very good. 

00:37:30
Okay, alright. 

00:37:35
JAY HALEY The therapist explored the life of the stepfather and asked why he had beaten the boy. The man said he did not want to use it as an excuse, but he had discovered he had cancer and was very upset. He also lost his athletic ability, which was important to him. This was his only incident of violence. He now was seeing a counselor and a probation officer for one year. He has seven months to go. 

00:38:05
Is it a deal? Okay! Ah… I need you to walkout with me, and I need you ah… if you… you know, I really need you to be ah… very gentle and apologetic to… And ah… you know, you can tell him you’re sorry if you want there, but say I really need to talk to you, I really need to say something to… I'd really appreciate if you would come in here with me. 

00:38:30
OBSERVING THE FIFTH INTERVIEW 

00:38:30
JAY HALEY The stepfather had not seen the ten-year-old boy since he beat him over a year ago. The therapist planned with him how to see the family. He began by seeing the boy alone. They embraced each other in a moving way. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:39:00
JAY HALEY The father apologized for having beaten him. The boy forgave him. The boy laughed with him. The boy says he's sorry for what happened. The stepfather says there was no reason for him to feel sorry, because he did nothing wrong. The therapist asked the father to give suggestions for dealing with violence. He said, "never hit and especially never, never hit a girl." The boy agreed and gave the stepfather some pointers on controlling anger. The boy said he is protecting his sisters in a fatherly way. The therapist brought in the twins. The father apologized to the boy in front of them and for causing the family to break up. The therapist arranged the hugging game for all of them. The mother was brought in and she said she loved the father. 

00:39:55
Yeah! What do you think about the dad? He was like, when we first went in together and he was first telling him, he had tears in his eyes. 

00:40:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:05
Yeah. 

00:40:05
DISCUSSING THE FIFTH INTERVIEW 

00:40:05
The dad did or the child? 

00:40:05
The dad did. The child did, too. 

00:40:10
And the dad denied everything. 

00:40:10
That's part of his problem I think. 

00:40:15
The kid saw it, though. 

00:40:15
JAY HALEY A contrast from the first interview you had with them, when you went in just to get them not to hit each other. 

00:40:20
We didn’t think that… that dad was going to come through like that, because initially before the boy came in, he was not taking responsibility at all. So we were worried. He seemed to come… come ah… you know to own up to things when the boy came in. 

00:40:40
Yeah! It was like pulling at my heart when I heard that. 

00:40:45
JAY HALEY He has put a lot of thought in that, I think. 

00:40:45
Yeah! Well, he feels it’s his fault that the family was ripped apart and that he should have been being a good boy or something you know. 

00:40:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:55
Did you see mom’s resistance when I had her take some kind of responsibility? 

00:41:05
Yeah, something that… that helped there or sometimes is to say, "I’m sorry for not protecting you." 

00:41:10
Yeah, okay! 

00:41:10
JAY HALEY Well, you did that, didn’t you? 

00:41:15
I don’t think I phrased it that way. 

00:41:15
JAY HALEY Oh, I thought you were. 

00:41:20
No, my face, my body was saying that. 

00:41:20
You did great leading. You were pulling along really well to… to get her to… to hold up to it and take some responsibility. That was great leading in that regard. Yeah, she didn’t know what to say like, "say it mom!" 

00:41:35
She did… She did do the heading. I mean, he's responsible for hitting (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:41:40
Right! 

00:41:45
I was very careful. I could feel the tears coming. I was like, whatever you don’t say, how do you feel? I was like talking to myself. 

00:41:55
Although you did ask at one point, what did you think about that? Is that okay? 

00:42:00
That was a great way to end a class. I tell you. I mean his… his face was worth it all. 

00:42:05
JAY HALEY That's right. 

00:42:05
Yeah. 

00:42:10
The family was seen for four more sessions and terminated successfully. The children were not violent nor misbehaving. In a one-year follow-up, the therapy was a success despite the number of therapists, supervisors, attorneys, and court people involved.
