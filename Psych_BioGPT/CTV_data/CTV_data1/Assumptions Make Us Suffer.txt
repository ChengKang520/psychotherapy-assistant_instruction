DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time every day to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is assumptions make us suffer. Don Miguel Ruiz, is the author of the Four Agreements, which explains that if you draw out the three quarters of the circle on a paper… piece of paper, you'll be able to recognize the shape of the full circle to come. The mind just fills in the gaps and assumes that the object being drawn will be a full circle. This same ability can leave us feeling terrible about many experiences that are not yet complete. We assume that, if our current spouse whose on a business trip and not answering our call is doing something we don't want them to do or may be cheating, before you have all the details. It's that filling in the blanks that gets us into trouble. Simply, because the last relationship failed when their spouse had an affair, when the phone rings then it's your spouse, telling you about an exciting workshop she or he attended at the conference that she's at. We begin to excuse, yell and complaint and you feel, you've left your partner emotionally alienated and confused, resulting in the exact opposite kind of relationship that you want. You're hoping for a sense of connection, some would be closer with you and instead you end up pushing that person away, all because of an assumption. We decided that because our past experience was the only option that our spouse was having an affair, rather than remaining open minded and calm, we make an assumption that leads to an undesirable outcome, pain and suffering. I always say there's plenty of time to be upset, if there is a problem. So, until you actually know give yourself an assumption break. In addition, as you see from the story above, the individual is essentially lying to themselves. So another corrected statement that I love is, if you're going to lie to yourself, why not choose something positive to say. For example, "My spouse loves me and we are working on our relationship and we work on our issues with care and compassion." So let's practice together. If you notice yourself jumping to a negative conclusion or assumption, remind yourself there is plenty of time to get upset if there is a real problem. In the mean time, I can take an assumption break. If you are already assuming the worst before you really know the outcome then you have a habit of telling yourself negative lies. It… It is the time to interrupt that habit as well. Instead say, "Things will work out fine. I've all I need right now to be happy. I can deal with that." Then challenge yourself further by reflecting on other moments when you believe something that you later recognize was untrue. Ask yourself, how do I learn this assumption? How did this assumption impact me? Is it useful or helpful? If not, what do I need to do to give it up? Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to be recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now, to form a healthy new practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day!
