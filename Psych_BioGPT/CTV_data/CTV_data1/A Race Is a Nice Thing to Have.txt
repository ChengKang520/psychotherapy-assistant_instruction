Helms, Ph.D. Interviewed by Allen E. Ivey, Ed.D., ABPP Introduction 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  You're about to see one of the outstanding minds of American Psychology, Dr. Janet E. Helms. I followed Dr. Helms' work over the years, read her articles, read her books, and she's had a lot to do with my own professional growth and understanding in areas of racism, assessment, and human development in general. This is an important scholar, author of many articles, ah, aid books, very active in national associations, has won endless awards, ah, you couldn't find anybody better. Ah, to be more precise, I'll have to read her present title. Janet E. Helms is the Augustus Long Professor of Counseling and Psychology and Director of the Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture at Boston College. She's a fellow in Division 17, Counseling Psychology, and Division 45, Ethnic Diversity of the American Psychological Association. Ah, she has many, many other accomplishments. One of her finest accomplishments is her work on race and her recent book, "A Race is a Nice Thing to Have." Ah, all of us can learn a lot about what race is and particularly, what is the nature of race in pertaining to White folks, ah, White people. I have learned a lot about this topic from talking with Dr. Janet Helms and reading her work. Ah, beyond that, Dr. Helms is an incredible mentor. She has many students throughout the nation, who, themselves, have developed national reputations. Her reputation really is that of a person that gets people together, ah, stimulates them to find new and important directions, and she's become almost a movement in herself, in her work. Ah, we're very lucky to hear what she has to say. I'd also add to this that, ah, she is a person, I think, of real deep personal warmth and caring. In the middle of all the scholarship, I'm always impressed with people that care. So, here we are with a very, very important scholar, a person I truly admire, Dr. Janet E. Helms. 

00:02:35
Chapter 1: The Meaning of Race in Society 

00:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Dr. Helms, it's an honor to be with you today. Ah, could you tell me what you'd like students, professors, and professional colleagues to get on of our conversation? 

00:02:55
JANET E. HELMS Thank you. It's an honor to be here today. What I'd like, ah, people to get out of my converse, conversation with you is the notion that you can have a whole conversation about white people, whiteness, white culture and the effects of whiteness in our society. We rarely talk about whiteness per se, and as a result, we don't understand other people 'coz we don't understand the people who were empowered. So, what I'd like first to do is to begin to think about how whiteness influences almost every aspect of our lives in US society. 

00:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY As a white person, I'd also have to say that you have taught me a lot about myself, my environment and what I need to think about myself as a racial being, and I found that's very helpful. So, what we're going to do is go through your new and important book, "A Race is a Nice Thing to Have." And I think we might start with, ah, Chapter One. Well, what is the meaning of race in our society? 

00:04:00
JANET E. HELMS Well, actually, people think that race is a biological construct. They look at people who have different skin colors and they think that skin color equals race, but one of the interesting things that we know now in the gene, genome era is that you really can't tell much about a person's ancestry by their physical appearance. So, a person who has no African ancestry could look Black and a person who has, who looks white could have considerably more African ancestry than the people we classify as Black. So, what I want us to begin to think about is that race is not really a biological construct and if it's not really a biological construct, then we can't really use it to explain behavior. But then you look at me and you say it, but people treat people differently based on... (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
JANET E. HELMS ...how they appear. And I agree with you, but that, and that's what we mean when we say that race is a social co, construct. We put people into categories and then treat them in ways that allow us to either maintain advantage that we are white or, ah, or disadvantaged if we are people of color. 

00:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  And now, could you go a little farther with, ah, race as a social construct 'coz I think this is a liberal challenge where people wanna put it down to genetics. Could you tell a little bit more about how it's constructed? 

00:05:15
JANET E. HELMS  Well, it comes out of a history of assigning, ah, Native Americans and then, ah, people of African descent into, ah, conditions of servitude, and the basis for doing that was, ah, skin color. 

00:05:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
JANET E. HELMS If you put people together and you segregate them, they naturally develop the same skin color. 

00:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
JANET E. HELMS But that doesn't necessarily have any implications for their behavior. But we tend to generalize from skin color to behavior. So, ah, people think that if you are white that must mean that you are superior in terms of your behavior. If you're not, you are inferior in terms of your behavior. Uhm, if you think about it, though, there's really nothing about a person's skin color that tells you how they will behave, and if that's the case, then we have to think about race as something that we have constructed in our minds about how people, ah, will, ah, behave, ah, respond to various situations. 

00:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  It becomes a very powerful way of social control on our society, separating people, making a difference, ah, often are for the advantage of people who are not persons of color. 

00:06:30
JANET E. HELMS As in white people? 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  That's who they are. They're called white people. 

00:06:35
Chapter 2: Social Class is Not Race 

00:06:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, another piece of this is social class. (Coughs) Excuse me. And soc, you say, social class is not race and, ah, sometimes they're put together. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit, and also, the US, Canada, ah, particularly, I don't like to deal with issues of social class. It's kind of a hidden factor, so I'd like to have you, sort of, define, to separate out those dimensions as you, you do in your book. 

00:07:20
JANET E. HELMS Well, interestingly, people like to talk about social class a lot more than they like to talk about whiteness, and in US Society, Canadian Society as well, ah, race is a social construct and social class are confounded so that white people, as a group, not every individual white person, but as a group, have more resources than people of color. 

00:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
JANET E. HELMS And so, the argument then becomes, well, we could have a just society if we were just to deal with the issues of social class. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
JANET E. HELMS But, in fact, social class is not the same thing as race. 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
JANET E. HELMS  Ah, we often don't even mean the same things when we talk about social class. 

00:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I, in the book, I talked about all of the different things that people use to mean social class. Ah, is social class your parents' education? Is social class your parents' income? Is social class your own income? Is social class your educational level? You can look at a person walking down the street and you can't tell any of those things about a person. On the other hand, if you look at a person walking down the street based on how they appear, you can tell something about how you're going to treat them in terms of race and you can probably guess how other people had treated them as well. So, race and social class cannot be substituted for each other 'coz they don't have the same affectations for behavior. 

00:08:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, I recall a good friend of mine, ah, he was down in New York and, ah, a very well-known professor, and, ah, he wanted a cab. Well, he's learned over time that he has to have his wife, ah, who's, who's extremely attractive to go out and get the cab. And, what does that do for people, and he's obviously a person of a high social class and, ah, doing very well nat, known nationally? Ah, how does, how would you talk about that situation? 

00:09:20
JANET E. HELMS Well, I need some more information. (chuckles) First, I need to know if he's extremely ugly. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY He's very good looking. 

00:09:25
JANET E. HELMS And, and what race would people assign ah, him to? 

00:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY They'd assign him to African-American race. 

00:09:30
JANET E. HELMS  Okay. So, you make my point that you really can't tell a person's social class by how they, how they look. 

00:09:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:09:40
JANET E. HELMS The cab drivers are not refusing to stop for him because of, of his wealth or perceived lack of wealth. 

00:09:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:45
JANET E. HELMS They're refusing to stop for him because of his color and their belief that his color has some implications for how he will behave. 

00:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. I've got a good friend, ah, in Florida that, ah, is a Chilean. And when he goes into a store he finds people following him around, and apparently he, again, his social class has nothing to do with whether he's followed or not. So. 

00:10:10
JANET E. HELMS And what color is he? 

00:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY He's, he's kind of, kind of a medium-skinned Hispanic, but he looks Hispanic, if, if there is a Hispanic look, I'm not sure there is myself. 

00:10:20
JANET E. HELMS Well, that's social construction. We, we assume there is one and we put people into categories according to our assumptions of what Hispanics look like, and then we treat them in ways that are consistent with our stereotypes of, of who they are. So, he, he's... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:10:35
JANET E. HELMS ...experiencing the Hispanic stereotype. 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, we really have automatic stereotypes around culture or many of us do, at least. 

00:10:40
JANET E. HELMS Ah, we are socialized to have stereotypes around ethnicity. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
JANET E. HELMS We're stereotyped, we're, ah, socialized to have stereotypes around, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
JANET E. HELMS racial categories as well. 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:10:50
Chapter 3: Who Needs a Color-Blind Society? 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, chapters, one of the chapters of your book says, "Who Needs a Color-Blind Society?" And, ah, what would be the advantages of a colorblind society or what were you thinking about when you write that chapter? 

00:11:20
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I think there are no advantages of a colorblind society, and let me just note that I realize that the name of that chapter is probably politically incorrect. 

00:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
JANET E. HELMS Ah, but the reason it's named that is because that's what white people say. If we just ignore race, then it won't be a problem. 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
JANET E. HELMS But obviously, if you're treating people differently on the basis of their, ah, pre, presumed racial categories then it's a problem. So, in that chapter, I talk about the facts that, the things that we ignore in our society, the things that we pretend are not there are things that have bad connotations for us. And so, if we continue to ignore race in our society or pretend that it doesn't exist, then what happens is that we'd never resolve the problems that are associated with it. 

00:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, you really would argue we need to become more aware at what, ah, paradoxically, we need to become more aware of the meaning of race so we can deal with it more effectively even though it doesn't exist. Does, and I, is that more or less accurate? 

00:12:25
JANET E. HELMS Ah, I think you hit the nail on the head. 

00:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
JANET E. HELMS Ah, we, what we push it out or repress comes back to bite us in the end, and so, what we're really aiming for is not only to recognize the ways to which operates as a social construct, but then to begin to find ways to change the way it operates as a social construct. 

00:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Now, a major issue, and that from my experience, and this, I speak, I speak for myself, as well, ah, it wasn't until I got into, ah, years ago, ah, doing a course with, ah, a wonderful woman, Norma Jean Anderson, African-American, and, ah, we co-taught a course called "Black and White in Helping", and I honestly have to say I did not really think about myself as a white person until I taught that course. And it was really an illuminating experience for me, and, ah, a chapter in your book says I'm not colored. Ah, I'm one of those White people that originally was unaware of my own color, and, ah, why do you think White people ought to need to learn about their color? 

00:13:35
JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, because their color carries with it definite political implications. 

00:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
JANET E. HELMS Ah, if you are White, if you are White in the society, actually regardless of your social class, that accords you privileges that are not given to people who are, ah, people of color. If you need, if you need to, if you want to exist in a peaceful society, eventually you're, one is going to have to recognize the power that goes with being White and make a decision to share that power. So, my whole idea about White people needing to become aware of their color is based on my assumption that morally, White people would like to be, ah, ah, moral people, wouldn't like to not be a people who are in the position of subjugating other people. If you want to be in a position of not subjugating, then you have to understand how it is that you either collude in that process or, ah, engage in that process yourself. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. It's, it's kind of like, it's, it's not okay now for White people to, ah, admit that, ah, that, that the, they might be racist or there is color, I mean, they just, it's an issue that, ah, I think, a lot of White people would just like to go away. I think what's going on nationally, currently and over the last several years of the administration is that, let's just forget about race and, ah, ah, keep things as they are. Ah, and these were ideas part of a, while simultaneously saying, ah, things were okay. And it's really an unwillingness, like on the part of many White people, to move beyond the surface level with respect to deeper levels. Ah, another example, ah, I was talking to, ah, a South Asian woman and, ah, she had lived in the South and encountered considerable discrimination in the South. Then she moved to California and she found California more troubling ah, than the South because she never knew where she stood with people. 

00:15:45
JANET E. HELMS  I, I, I, I think that happens often, uhm, and I kind of talk about it in various chapters in the book. If you don't really have a clear sense of yourself as a White person, if you don't really have a clear sense of what your social justice goals are, or, or not, as a White person... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
JANET E. HELMS ...and it's really difficult for the people to understand who you are and to deal with you in a way that's authentic. 

00:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  This is a classic statement, ah, you'll hear. Ah, people had been here several general, generations, many friends would say, ah, you know, ah, been here like thr, grandfather, father, English is better than mine, and people will say, "Where are you from?" and they'll say, "Oregon" or "South Carolina." They say, "No, where are you from?" with the inference that they are from China or some place else. Ah, the idea, nobody would ever ask me that type of question. Ah, the assumption is that if you're a person of color, you're somehow different and it's that, I think it's a good example of your idea of social construction of race. 

00:16:55
Chapter 4: I'm Not Colored! 

00:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  What do you think that White people should learn about color? What are some specifics that White people need to learn about their color? 

00:17:10
JANET E. HELMS  Well, It's not necessarily their color that I think they need to learn about, it's the social implications that their. (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Social construction that go with it. Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
JANET E. HELMS Right. So, everyday in the world, a White person, if he or she, ah, puts his or her mind to it, can observe ways in which whiteness gives them privilege. And so, the basic thing that one needs to learn is that one has privilege, even though you think you don't. Ah, Peggy McIntosh talks about her own privileges as a White person... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
JANET E. HELMS ...the daily, day-to-day things that happen in her life that are privileged things that do not happen for other people. Ah, being able to live wherever you want to, being able to go into a store and usually not be followed around by clerks, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
JANET E. HELMS ...who think you are going to steal something. If you're a woman, being able to go into a store and, ah, buying make-up that matches you. Ah, in many, in many ways, if you go through your day as a White person, you'll find that there are privileges that you take for granted. When you. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And you don't even, and I don't even think of them and we don't even think of these privileges, it's just what we do and we're not even aware that they're not open to many, many people of color. 

00:18:25
JANET E. HELMS  Exactly, and so when you're in the majority and everyone you know has those privileges, it's really difficult for you to imagine that you're having those privileges might mean that somebody else in your society does not have them. 

00:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, I can go into a bank or I can go in to buy a car and expect that, ah, I will be treated with respect. If you're a person of color, I gather that you just have to wait and see if you're gonna be treated with respect. The, the, (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
JANET E. HELMS And, and. 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY ...there's a certain feeling about the lack of trust, is that the right word? 

00:19:00
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, if you're a person of color and you're smart, there's a feeling of lack of trust. 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, if this person is smart, you really should have a lack of trust and check out what's going, what's going to happen. 

00:19:10
JANET E. HELMS Exactly, until, in many ways, it's a situation where, ah, because you are defined as an out-group person, then you're defined as a person who's to be taken advantage of. And so, another way of thinking about why it's important for White people to become aware of their whiteness is, that allows them to expand the people they think of as their in-group. 

00:19:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  An example, ah, that(ph) occurred to me as I've been lucky enough to teach several times in Australia, and I became quite friendly, ah, and we developed some videotapes with, ah, ah, Matt Rigney and, ah, David Rathman. And it's(ph) very exciting, I learned a lot. But along the way, ah, I'm a curious person, (laughs) as you can tell I'm asking a lots of questions, and, ah, and I, one day, they're asking Matt some question about aboriginals and aboriginal life, and he said, "Allen, could you just stop for a minute?" He says, "I want to tell you what happens to me when you're asking me a question. First, I gotta think of, do I trust you enough to answer that question? There's(ph) some questions I feel safe in answering, others I don't. Then, after I do that, after I think of the answer, and you know what's happened all over that time? You've asked me this another question." And, ah, it was a very illuminating thing to me to learn that, ah, I need to pay more attention to myself and learn perhaps in a more gentle way, and I also learned, I think from David and Matt, (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
JANET E. HELMS Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY that, ah, ultimately, I come from a, being White, I come from a situation where I don't think I can ever escape, ah, the benefits, the privileges, and the power of racism no matter what I do. There's something I think I need to work on everyday, and this is where your work, I think, has been so important and helpful in helping me explore my whiteness, and to think about it, and I'm, you know, that's one of the reason I feel really honored to work with you today. So, I think there's a lot of things that we, White people need to learn about color, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
JANET E. HELMS  I agree with you. 

00:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY (laughs) You agree with me? Okay. 

00:21:20
Chapter 5: But What Color Am I? 

00:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  What is white culture and how is it expressed? 

00:21:35
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, in, in many respects, white culture is, ah, the general principle that, ah, this country was built. It's the notion that individualism is important. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Individualism? 

00:21:50
JANET E. HELMS And so, it's an indi, individualistically-oriented culture. 

00:21:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
JANET E. HELMS It's a culture that believes that, ah, the goal ought to be, to be at the top, so, it's a competitive culture. It's a culture in which, ah, ah, resources are important, so the more resources you have, the better you are. Resources inc, can include things such as education, resources include money, land. And so the notion is that(ph) one ought to acquire as much of that as you can in order to be a good person. Uhm, white culture is a culture that, ah, assigns, ah, value to aspects as, of other cultures that would not being valued. For instance, time, in white culture, you can waste time, in other cultures, time just is, it's not a quantity, it's not a commodity. Ah, white culture is a culture in which, in which people are valued by what they accomplish rather than who they are. White culture is a, is a culture in whi, which, ah, being young is valued as a commodity, ah, but not too young right in the middle. Ah, so that, ah, to, to appear young is a very important goal whereas in other cultures, ah, to not be young is a, is an asset. Uhm, there are many ways in which one could talk about white culture, but I think the main issue is that white culture is so embedded in the society that, often, we don't recognize when we are, ah, forcing other people to conform to that culture. 

00:23:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uhm. Wow. What a list. Ah, I've, I've been taking notes here 'coz I think they need to be repeated. Ah, I kind of put it all together that if you haven't, ah, succeeded and aren't at the top, it's your fault. Ah, I think the real part of individualism is you're, build yourself on your own bootstraps. And you're honored for building yourself on your own boot, bootstraps rather than being honored for what you've done for somebody else. Self-esteem rather than esteem for somebody else, which I think can lead to alienation and loneliness. Ah, the resources, ah, are certainly there, ah, and, and getting resources is what's important rather than getting in relationships, ah, and this are never 100 percent for White people or for people of color, but this tend to be a central aspect of, of culture, I think, ah, particularly in the US, somewhat in Canada. Ah, but you mentioned the issue of time, ah, it's very, very different, ah, particularly, ah, (clears throat) with traditional people, ah. But I think the bottom line is, if you don't follow white culture's norms, ah, somehow, you're off, you're off base. So that, ah, white culture is expressed in a lot of individualistic ways. Uhm, and you certainly describe a lot of specifics. 

00:25:00
Chapter 6: Recognizing Racism 

00:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  How do we go about recognizing racism, ah, most people, White people will state that they're not racist, ah, and yet experts in the field say that conscious and unconscious racism plays itself out in many, many ways. How would you suggest that we recognize and identify racism, ah, particularly, racism in ourselves as White folks? 

00:25:35
JANET E. HELMS Ah, let me just say that I agree with you that a lot of white people will respond that they are not racist. But that is probably the only way, ah, or the only concept, the only self-defining term that people use where they talk about what they are not as opposed to what they are. 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
JANET E. HELMS  Ah, you wouldn't for instance, say, "I'm not a woman," you would say, "I am a man." So, in many respects, I think what happens with White people is, they don't really have a system of what the opposite of, of racist is. And so all they know is that they don't want to be whatever it is that racism is. But they really don't have a goal. They really don't have an idea of what it would, is that they would like to be. In U.S. Society, and maybe Canadian and European societies or generally, the, racism is actually the imposition of white privilege onto other people, onto people who were not considered to be White in that society. So, in order to recognize racism, one begins with recognizing the white privilege operates at many levels, not just at the individual level, but at the governmental-systemic level, as well as the cultural level in societies. And then one has to make a conscious decision whether one wants to continue to be involved in that process and if not, how best to change it. 

00:27:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'm particularly taken by your comment ah, "I'm not racist." And you've given me a whole new thought, ah, the next time I hear that and say, "Well, if you're non-racist, what are you in relationship to race? What is your position?" 'Coz, ah, "I'm not," is not defining where(ph) you are. (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
JANET E. HELMS That's right. 

00:27:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I think, that's an important question for each one of us to ask. And I appreciate that. Ah, now, Derald Wing Sue talks about microagressions and their, their effect on people of color. Ah, could you define what a microagression is and as a part of, of racism and it's cumulative, negative in, impact on ah, people of color? 

00:27:50
JANET E. HELMS Well, I could, but then we will be shifting the conversation to people of color. So, let me see if I can do it this way. Suppose we talk about, microagressors and what the impact of that is on White people. Ah, microagressors are people who consciously or unconsciously engage in small racist acts of that potentially harm people of color but also harm themselves. For instance, ah, you talked about someone following your friend around the store, that's microagression. It's, it's, it's a small event that occurred but it's perpetrated by someone and that someone has to go home and lie and know that the only reason they followed your friend around the store was that that person was not a White person. Microagression happens when I get on to an elevator and someone grabs a White person, a White woman actually, grabs her purse ah, to keep me from stealing her money. 

00:28:50
ALLEN E. IVEY That happens to you? 

00:28:55
JANET E. HELMS Oh, sure. Lots. Uhm, a microagression has happened to me but she also has committed a microagression herself. At some point in her day, she has to realize that she was afraid of me that, at, although I had done nothing to her and that she cho, goes around in a perpetual state of fear of... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
JANET E. HELMS ...Black women, ah, who might steal ah, her purse. So, microagressions hurt the people who are victims of them, but they also hurt the perpetrator because in many ways, it means that the perpetrator is always in a state of, "How should I behave in a way that protects me from other people." 

00:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY It almost like they have to deny ah, what they're really doing and they feel they're moral and then there's little piece, little chink that comes in and they're actually hurting themselves. 

00:29:45
JANET E. HELMS  Exactly. 

00:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
JANET E. HELMS And it's automatic. 

00:29:50
Chapter 7: A Model of White Racial Development 

00:29:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, you have developed, ah, I think it's kinda, there's an interesting story that goes with this. Why did you come up with the theory of white identity development? I think that I've heard this before but I think we need to get it on camera as well. 

00:30:15
JANET E. HELMS Well, when I was ah, I'm not sure of, I don't know whether to give the long one or the short one, so I'll give you the short one. When I was, ah, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois ah, University, I won a tenure, (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
JANET E. HELMS and so I was looking for a research topic. Uhm, in fact, I started working with Thomas Car-Parham on Black racial identity but when we submitted manuscripts for ah, Black racial identity, the reviewers would always send them back with ah, notices saying, "Well, how do you know there's any difference between Black people or White people? Black people don't have an identity that's different from White people. Why don't you study white identity?" And so, since they told me to and I wanted to get published so I could get tenure, I started studying white identity. 

00:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. Did you find there wasn't any white identity theory there to work with, so you said, "I'd better figure it out," huh? 

00:31:10
JANET E. HELMS Exactly. 

00:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Exactly. 

00:31:10
Chapter 8: Contact: "I'm an Innocent" 

00:31:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, (clears throat) the first step to developing a positive white identity is discovering that you are white. Ah, and what are the stages of a, not the stages, what are, you have developed what's called " schemas" of identity development and, ah, Chapter six, you'd, I mean, not Chapter six, there's a chapter where you talked about "Contact: I am the innocent." So, what happens to the White person at this ah, early schema as they think about themselves as a White person? 

00:31:55
JANET E. HELMS Okay, let me, let me deal with schemas first because that... (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I think the word, "schema," might be u, be useful. 

00:32:00
JANET E. HELMS ...that is different from the way in which I originally talked about ah, white identity. 

00:32:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, schemas are ah, way the people organize information about race. Think about them as the eyeglasses that people wear. 

00:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
JANET E. HELMS And as long as the pair of eyeglasses works, then it gives you a view of the world that allows you to act on that world. Uhm, and by act I mean, it allows you to see the world, it allows you to understand it in a particular way and as a consequence, you react in a particular way. Ah, when that schema no longer works, and just as eyeglasses, you try on a new pair to see if you can find something else that works for you. So, schemas are the different pairs of eyeglasses that one uses if one is a White person, in this case, to think about race. The first schema or set of eyeglasses that I talked about is as you've mentioned, contact. Uhm, contact for me is where... (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
JANET E. HELMS ...you talk about yourself as being originally, not seeing a race, not understanding that race has any implications. And so in many ways, being naive about the intersection between race and its social implications in its society. 

00:33:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So basically, ah, they really don't think about it, ah, just, just no, no contact, no understanding? 

00:33:30
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, or if they have contact, it's a very naive kind of contact. 

00:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, let me give you an example. A colleague of mine, who has known me for many years, one day looked at me and said, "Well, you're not Black, you're brown." Well, that's certainly true. But that was kind of a naive understanding of what it means to be Black in the, in the society. So, she was naive. She was, in many ways, oblivious to the social implications of, of race in the society. 

00:34:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. It's just about really seeing what's going on. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
JANET E. HELMS Exactly. 

00:34:10
ALLEN E. IVEY What does a person need to learn at this stage to help move that stage, this, through this, through this, what does a person need to do to change his pair of glasses so it, ah, at least move to the next, a, a more, a different schema. The next one I guess is called "disintegration." What happens that lead to a change in schema? 

00:34:30
JANET E. HELMS Well, the positive aspect of using contact schema is that in many ways, it encourages you to be involved with people who are not like you. Uhm, and often they will let you be involved with them because, at least, you're curious about it. Uhm, and to the extent that that's true, then you begin to interact with them in ways that are inconsistent with white racial socialization. 

00:35:00
Chapter 9: Disintegration: "How can I be White?" 

00:35:00
JANET E. HELMS  So, the new set of glasses develops in response to people saying uhm, "You're not behaving the way a properly socialized White per, person should behave." Uhm, in our research with, ah, teenagers at, ah, University of Maryland, we asked them to talk about critical racial incidents in their life. And one of the critical racial incidents was that, ah, when they began to date, when they reached the age of dating, and they dated someone who was not considered to be White, their families quickly reined them in. Ah, they talked about, ah, acts of violence, they talked about their families threatening to disown them ah, all sorts of things occur when you violate the rules of white racial socialization. 

00:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
JANET E. HELMS So, as you begin to learn that you can lose your privileges, then, ah, that's, you begin to, ah, become capable of using the schema that I call, "disintegration." That's confusion. That's recognizing that on one hand, there is a moral way to be, but on the other hand, if you behave in that way, ah, and it's, ah, not the way that you are socialized to behave, then you can in fact, lose your privileges in, in your white society. 

00:36:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. You know, I, I kinda think about ah, kids that go right there from the sixth grade to middle school where they're working together, eating together and so forth, and suddenly in, ah, middle school, we get to the separate tables for Blacks and Whites, ah. Uhm, could you tell us a little bit more about the schema that goes with disintegration? What happens there? 

00:36:45
JANET E. HELMS  Well, it's constantly being aware of the moral dilemmas of how you think things are ought to be but how do things have to be in order to maintain privilege. Uhm, you'd. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, you'd really become aware of the schizophrenia in our society at some level? 

00:37:05
JANET E. HELMS Yes. Uhm, many, ah, White people talked to me about, for instance, being taught that all people are created equal but then recognizing that they're not suppose to treat all people as if they were created equal. Or if you're standing on a corner, a White person and, I'm standing on a corner, waiting for a taxi, and the taxi stops in front of, ah, the White person, does the White person take the taxi or do they give it up for the person of color? So, it's recognizing that there are all sorts of crossroads, if you will, that, ah, represent life dilemmas and deciding, ah, and being caught between which of those things you're going to do. 

00:37:40
Chapter 10: Reintegration: "We have the best because we are the best!" 

00:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  So, it really is an issue of morality and a kind of a period of confusion, ah, and yet follows this as what you call, "reintegration." Ah, what happens there? White people often find themselves facing, ah, themselves as cultural being and take the easy way out. 

00:38:10
JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, it is the case that confusion, which is disintegration doesn't feel good. Uhm, and because in our society, there aren't any readily available strategies for curing the anxiety, the confusion associated with racial disintegration, ah, people find a cure for themselves. Sometimes, what they do is to put back on their contact glasses and just pretend that everything is all right. And sometimes what they do is they decide that, ah, their discomfort is caused by other people. So, their general belief is that, if they have privileges that other people don't have, the other people must have done something to give up their privileges and when that begins to become the person's way of resolving racial dilemmas, then they are able to use their reintegre, reintegration schema. 

00:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. Would you say that this is a predominant way of thinking in, in our country, ah, or, ah, I get the feeling a lot of people, that's where they are, or. 

00:39:20
JANET E. HELMS I, I think the predominant way of thinking is probably contact obliviousness. 

00:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, really? You think it goes right back to just failure to look at the issues and. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
JANET E. HELMS I think so. Uhm, but after that, I would sa, I think that reintegration would, would follow. 

00:39:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, there's really no consequence in our society for using reintegration schema. Uhm, and so people feel quite comfortable doing that. 

00:39:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
ALLEN E. IVEY If nothing else it gives them a sense that their privilege is deserved. 

00:39:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It's kinda like, if you're White, you're right. If you're Black, stand back. 

00:39:55
JANET E. HELMS Exactly. 

00:39:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, okay. But. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
JANET E. HELMS  And if you're brown, don't stick around. 

00:40:00
Chapter 11: Pseudo-Independent: "Let's help them become more like Whites." 

00:40:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Then there is another stage which you, another schema, if you wanna use the word stage ah, ah, ah, it's called "pseudo-independent." Ah, and I, let's help, ah, them become more like Whites. Ah, complex stage, 'coz you talk about that it's, it sounds like the word, "white liberal." 

00:40:35
JANET E. HELMS Ah, "white liberal," is, is exactly how I would think about that. Uhm, and in many respects uhm, I think, ah, that schema is a schema that's, ah, defined by people's attempts to help resolve the problems of race in the society. It's just that they don't understand that what they're, in their efforts to help, that they're still imposing, ah, white cultural structure onto other people's situations without understanding the implications of racism in that structure. 

00:41:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. So it's, they made you good things but they do it in a kind of a, well, I guess we might say, a missionary sense. "I'm right, ah, you need to change." 

00:41:20
JANET E. HELMS Well, I'm right I'm going to help you to change. 

00:41:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm gonna help you change. 

00:41:20
JANET E. HELMS  Some, some of the, actually, most of the ah, former affirmative action programs were based around this, ah, pseudo-independent ah, schema. That is, the idea was, if you could do special programs to help people of color, ah, get high test scores, then they would be more like White people and they would do well in the schools and everything would be okay. 

00:41:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:41:45
JANET E. HELMS But that kind of strategy doesn't recognize the extent to which people bring different perspectives, different languages, different cultures to testing situations. 

00:41:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
JANET E. HELMS And therefore, just helping to indic, ah, the test scores will not actually resolve the educational dilemmas that they face. 

00:42:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So, where do, you mentioned that word, "affirmative action," what are your thoughts about, ah, about that concept? 

00:42:10
JANET E. HELMS I think people don't understand the concept. Uhm, I think, uhm, in many ways, I'm distressed because, ah, society is moving away from ah, that concept. And I'm also exceptionally distressed that White people, particularly White women, don't understand the extent to which they benefited from that concept in our society. Uhm, I think we're moving very quickly back to a, se, a sense of contact where our(ph) issues of affirmative action are concerned. 

00:42:45
Chapter 12: Emersion/Immersion: "I'm White!" 

00:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, how many people reached the next schema, the next set of glasses ah, "I'm white!" And, ah, tell us more about, about that. 

00:43:05
JANET E. HELMS  Ah, I think that's more of the "missionary-type" schema that you were talking about. It's, ah, beginning to ask the questions about what are my personal responsibilities for race and racism in the society, and how can I change the society so that it doesn't operate in the socially unjust way that it does, with respect to race. Uhm, the person using the schema is trying to re-educate him or herself about the meaning of race, but they're also trying to re, reintegrate other White people about the meaning of race. And this is actually an important schema because this is one where the person recognizes that their mission is probably not to change people of color but to change White people. 

00:43:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:43:50
JANET E. HELMS  Because, you know, in effect, White people are the ones who had the power and it can change the structure. 

00:43:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  Yeah. Racism, ah, discrimination, power, white privilege is a White problem. 

00:44:05
JANET E. HELMS It's exactly. And the person who uses the schema understands that. 

00:44:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:10
JANET E. HELMS And accepts the responsibility for changes. 

00:44:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And guilt goes with that pretty much too or is that something that is, ah, a burden? What are your thoughts about that emotion of guilt? 

00:44:20
JANET E. HELMS Well, I think guilt goes with disintegration, actually and it's a part of, well, I, ah, not just. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So, this becomes more of a positive. (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
JANET E. HELMS  This is positive... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY An affirmative type of fact. (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
JANET E. HELMS ...in many respects. This is, this is more anger actually. 

00:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah. 

00:44:30
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, anger at one's self for having colluded in the process but often, it's also angry, anger at one's, ah, White peers and colleagues. 

00:44:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:40
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, which, uhm, fuels the efforts but also it can be problematic for the person. 

00:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So, this set of glasses enables a person to look at things really from a very different moral perspective. 

00:44:55
JANET E. HELMS It does. 

00:44:55
ALLEN E. IVEY They look at themselves and can criticize themselves, move outside of themselves and see their own participation in, in the past and probably in the present. 

00:45:05
JANET E. HELMS I, I think that's a good summary. 

00:45:05
Chapter 13: Autonomy: "I see color and I like it!" 

00:45:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  And then, we have, ah, after "Emersion/Immersion: I'm white!" We have "Autonomy: I see color and I like it!" Ah, I wrote down here is that, ah, recently I went into a bank in Boston, saw four tellers working together, ah, one Latino, ah, ah, one African American, two White, I mean, this is what the, what, coming from the socially constructed concept of race, and it just felt good. Ah, I see color and I like it. Ah, it's, it's noticing in some situation that there are not many people of color there and(ph) what's going on. Ah, how would you describe the schema of autonomy? 

00:46:05
JANET E. HELMS Well, the first thing I would say about, ah, autonomy is that it's an ideal. And so, uhm, I'm not sure how many people use it because it's a process, sometimes you're using it and sometimes you're not. Ah, the goal is to use it more often than not. But autonomy is essentially, a humanistic orientation. It's a belief that all people are valuable regardless of how they look. And it's a commitment to help infuse that, that thing, that belief system into the society. So, when a person is using autonomy, they would not be co, comfortable working in an environment where all of the people looked just like them. They would not be comfortable, ah, living in a, in a, living or working in an environment where all of the people looked just like them. Ah, they would not be comfortable taking privileges when those privileges were not available to people who do not, do not look like them. So, it's a sense of integrating, ah, one's belief system in, in the society and one's belief system should be about social fairness and humanism and loving and liking one's self, but also the other people in one's life space. 

00:47:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Really a focus on interconnectors of the, ah, and, a focus on interconnectedness and responsibility almost the word, "love," I'd almost think now. 

00:47:30
JANET E. HELMS Ah, I. (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
ALLEN E. IVEY The real challenging state. Now, one thing you said there, Dr. Helms, was, ah, in and out of the stage. I know you worked with Dr. Parham, Dr. Thomas Parham, and he sometimes talk about the concept to recycling. Ah, are these schemas, sort of, you, you get here and then you'll never return or is it something that recycles and you move in and out of different schemas at different times according to the context? 

00:47:55
JANET E. HELMS Right. I, I actually talk about view, that's moving in and out of the process. So, I think about them as, ah, dynamic processes that, ah, you can move in and out of, or that you can you use or not use, ah, depending on what's happening in your life. 

00:48:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, if you got a set of glasses, you can just pull them out and use them or not. 

00:48:15
JANET E. HELMS Exactly. The only difference is that sometimes, these glasses put themselves on for you rather than you selecting it. 

00:48:20
ALLEN E. IVEY  (laughs) That(ph), that's kind of, kind of tough. 

00:48:25
Chapter 14: Using Racial Identity Schemas to Understand Daily Events 

00:48:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about institutional, ah, racism, institutional privilege, institutional power. Ah, we've been kind of talking primarily from an individual frame of reference. But what is, what is the effect of general society and institutions on this whole process? Where do you see our society? I would imagine this is, ah, entire society could move through these different types of schema. 

00:49:00
JANET E. HELMS  Well, yes, society is composed of individuals and so all of the things that you see at the individual level, you also see at the societal level. Uhm, in many respects, it's difficult to talk about society as a whole because there are so many different pockets of society that are functioning in different ways. But if we talk about the, ah, government, for a moment, ah, to me, it's, it's using probably a combination of contact, being oblivious to racial dynamics and reintegration, ah, thinking that, ah, one's own policies are correct if one, if one is White. I think about, for instance, the recent Supreme Court decision, in which they effectively overturned Brown versus Topeka. That was clearly a decision in which these majority of the Supreme, Supreme Court was using both the contact schema. They were pretending that racial dynamics do not matter in the society, and a reintegration schema they, in effect, said that ah, even if they, there are racial consequences, our way of doing things is the best way. 

00:50:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So, the government policies certainly sets the tone. Ah, in other sense, ah, corporations, I think, are a mixed bag, on the other hand, ah, our society by 2050 will be predominantly, ah, persons of color and, ah, certain states ah, California, Arizona and Florida, I believe, for example, are already, ah, Whites, ah, European-Americans as of the whole are uhm, not the leading numbers. Ah, so, ah, I think, these things are going to have to be dealt with over time. And, ah, corp, what are, what are your thought, ah, speaking first about corporations. So, corporations seem to recognize these facts that made more of an effort, ah, to, at least this from my perspective, maybe this is not yours, ah, it seemed to have made a better effort of ah, doing something than perhaps, other areas of our society. Would you agree or disagree and what are your thoughts? 

00:51:25
JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I think many corporations have made efforts to, ah, deal with issues of diversity in their, in their work space. I think like the rest of the society, often they don't have much of an idea about how to deal with... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
ALLEN E. IVEY They (chuckles) don't have. 

00:51:40
JANET E. HELMS ...race per se, as a, as an issue in their environment. I, I think, we still have to get past the idea that what you do has increased the number of faces that are not like faces and then you dealt with diversity. It's much more complicated than that. You not only have to increase the, ah, the visible representation of groups in the environment but you also have to change the power structure so that it recognizes that those people have value, that they bring something to the corporate structure other than just their skin color, a way of thinking, a way of, of, ah, ah, functioning that perhaps, White people don't do. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. There is a certain tendency in corporations and society in general, as again, as you would say, ah, "Be White like us. Come into our corporation, present a face, but, ah, present a face which, ah, not much different than we already have." You're suggesting that maybe a little more flexibility and, ah, thinking what you can learn from these employees and. 

00:52:40
JANET E. HELMS  E, exactly. Uhm, we know for instance, that most of the groups of color in our society come from cultural backgrounds that are much more collectivistic than, well, those of their White counterparts. 

00:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:52:55
JANET E. HELMS Ah, businesses are now recognizing that what they need is more collectivism in their organizations. 

00:53:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:00
JANET E. HELMS  Wouldn't it be a good idea to hire people of color who could help teach them how to be collective? 

00:53:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Wouldn't that would be nice, ah, as a university professor, which is, ah, university is the greatest place for individualism and lack of collectivism. I would sit and say, "Wow, that would really be comfortable to, to go through a different orientation." Ah, ah, what concluding comments might you have? What else would you like to say as we finish the day? 

00:53:30
JANET E. HELMS Well, I would just conclude by encouraging White people to think about race, to talk about race, to be race, because we could only change the way it functions if we are able to face the scary aspects of it. And I think it's important for White people to do that. 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And I would say I'm delighted to have this chance of having read your material and so forth. I, pretty much thought I had understanding, but I was, I got a lot of new insights today and I thank you for helping me progress along the trail. Thank you Dr. Helms. (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
JANET E. HELMS Thank you. Thank you.
